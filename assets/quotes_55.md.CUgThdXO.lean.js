B. Comer Bridge, was a two-lane, long, Warren truss bridge spanning the Tennessee River along Alabama State Route 35 in Scottsboro, Alabama. The bridge was named after Alabama governor Braxton Bragg Comer, who served from 1907 to 1911. Construction of the bridge was carried out by the Kansas City Bridge Company for the Alabama State Bridge Corporation. Its construction commenced in 1929 and was complete by 1931. As of 2013, this was the only remaining bridge of the 15 memorial toll bridges constructed by the Alabama State Bridge Corporation. By 2007, the aging structure was classified by the Alabama Department of Transportation as being a structurally deficient bridge with an overall rating of 7.7 out of 100. Construction of a replacement bridge commenced in October 2007, and is expected to be completed in late 2015. As of April 2016, the replacement is several months away from completion. The Comer Bridge was scheduled to be demolished in 2015 although preservation efforts are underway and the Comer Bridge Foundation has been organized. In April 2013, the bridge was named one of the top ten \\"Top Rated Unique Savable Structures\\" by BridgeHunter.com. On October 31, 2013, the B. B. Comer Bridge was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage. On April 29, 2016, the bridge closed to all traffic with the opening of the new bridge. Crews began removing the road deck immediately after closure. Demolition of the original span began June, 2016 and was completed in July. A pyramid shaped sculpture built from the steel of the north entrance of the bridge was installed at Scottsboro High School in May 2018 as a monument to the bridge.

The bell tower. Santa Maria dei Carmini, also called Santa Maria del Carmelo and commonly known simply as the Carmini, is a large Roman Catholic church in the sestiere, or neighbourhood, of Dorsoduro in Venice, northern Italy. It nestles against the former Scuola Grande di Santa Maria del Carmelo, also known as the Scuola dei Carmini. This charitable confraternity was officially founded in 1597, and arose from a lay women's charitable association, the Pinzocchere dei Carmini. The members of this lay group were associated as tertiaries to the neighbouring Carmelite monastery. They were responsible for stitching the scapulars for the Carmelites. History The church originally was called Santa Maria Assunta, and first dated to the 14th century (circa 1348).Karl Baedeker's guide, page338. The brick and marble facade contains sculpted lunettes by Giovanni Buora. Among the roofline decorations are images of Elisha and Elijah, thought to be founders of the Carmelite order. The bell tower, designed by Giuseppe Sardi, is topped by a statue of the Madonna del Carmine sculpted in 1982 as a replacement by Romano Vio. The previous original was destroyed by lightning. Description The chancel and side chapels in the interior were rebuilt in 1507-14 by Sebastiano Mariani from Lugano. The counter-facade has a large monument (1602) to Jacopo Foscarini who was a procurator of San Marco, admiral of the fleet, and whose family palace lies across the canal. The second altar on the right has an altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Shepherds (1509–11) by Cima da Conegliano. The third altar on the right has a Madonna del Carmelo with saints (1595) by Pase Pace and Giovanni Fontana. The statues of Virginity (left) and Humility on the right of the nave were completed (1722–1723) by Antonio Corradini and Giuseppe Torritti respectively. The bronze angels on the balustrade are by Girolamo Campagna. The wooden frontal represents the Miracles of the Madonna (1724) and was carved by Francesco Bernadoni. The Tabernacle is by Giovanni Scalfarotto. The fourth altar on the right has the funereal monument to Andrea Civran (1572), a Venetian general. The Glorification of the Scapular (1709) was frescoed by Sebastiano Ricci on the nave ceiling. The stucco work was completed by Pietro Bianchini to designs of Abbondio Stazio. In the fresco, the angels uphold a scapular, and a painted inscription say it is an ornament of Mt Carmel. The fourth altar on the left, past the entry to the sacristy, was erected by the guild of the Compravendi Pesce or fishmongers (1548) with an altarpiece depicting the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple (1541–1542) by a young Jacopo Tintoretto. The third chapel on the left has an altarpiece depicting the Lamentation of the Dead Christ (c. 1476) by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. In front of the chancel are paintings by Marco Vicentino, Palma il Giovane, and Gaspare Diziani. The second altar on the left has two statues depicting the prophets Elijah and Elisha by Tommaso Rues. Elijah holds a flaming sword. The first altar has a painting of St Nicholas of Bari in Glory between St John the Baptist and St Lucy (1529) by Lorenzo Lotto. The upper register of the nave is lined with 24 large canvases from the 1666-1730s, painted by artists such as Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Gaspare Diziani, Girolamo Brusaferro and Pietro Liberi.

Background  It is not known when Guo Zhengyi was born. He was from Ding Prefecture (定州, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei). He passed the imperial examination during the reign of Emperor Taizong, and subsequently served as a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), as well as an imperial scholar.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 678, Tang forces commanded by the chancellor Li Jingxuan, suffered a major defeat at the hands of Tufan's general Gar Trinring Tsendro (\\"Lun Qinling\\" () in Chinese), and the major general Liu Shenli () was captured. In light of this major defeat, Emperor Gaozong asked his officials for the proper response against Tufan. Guo Zhengyi advocated going on the defensive for several years while regathering the people's strength, a proposal concurred in by other officials Liu Jingxian and Huangfu Wenliang (), and Emperor Gaozong accepted the proposal. In 681, Guo was made the Mishu Shaojian (), deputy head of the archival bureau as well as acting Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau. In 682, he was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. It was said that because Guo had been at the legislative bureau for a long period and was familiar with how it was run, most of the edicts were drafted by him, and he was considered capable in this. In 683, when Emperor Gaozong became seriously ill, he had Guo, along with Pei Yan and Liu, assist his crown prince Li Zhe in handling important matters of state.  During Empress Dowager Wu's regency  Emperor Gaozong died in late 683 and was succeeded by Li Zhe (as Emperor Zhongzong), but Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Wu served as regent and empress dowager. Soon after Emperor Zhongzong's ascension, around the new year 684, she made Guo Zhengyi the principal of the imperial university, no longer a chancellor. Just a short time thereafter, Emperor Zhongzong, who displayed signs of independence, was deposed by Empress Dowager Wu and replaced by his brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong). For the next few years, Guo was moved between several positions—first as the prefect of Jin Prefecture (晉州, roughly modern Linfen, Shanxi), then the deputy head of the archival bureau (by this time known as Lintai Jian (), then acting prefect of Shan Prefecture (陝州, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). He was serving as the prefect of Shan Prefecture as of 689, when Xu Jingzhen (), the brother of Xu Jingye the Duke of Ying, who had led an unsuccessful rebellion against Empress Dowager Wu in 684, was captured after spending several years in hiding. During the interrogation of Xu Jingzhen and Zhang Siming (), a county magistrate who had assisted Xu Jingzhen in his years of hiding, Xu and Zhang implicated a large number of officials—hoping that by doing so, they would be spared. Among those who were implicated were Guo, along with other key officials Zhang Guangfu, Zhang Chujin (), Yuan Wanqing (), and Wei Yuanzhong. Zhang Guangfu was executed, but Guo, Zhang Chujin, Yuan, and Wei were spared and exiled to the Lingnan region. Guo, however, died while on the way to exile or in exile, and his assets were confiscated.However, the chronology of Wu Zetian's regency and reign in the New Book of Tang indicated that Guo was executed in exile.

History The construction of the Centre was part of the Australian Government's Bali Recovery Package after the 2002 Bali bombings, and was achieved after a submission to the Australian Government from The John Fawcett Foundation. The $7 million project was commissioned by AusAID, with a design team which included experts from Australia and Indonesia. It opened officially on 27 July 2007 and began treating patients on 1 October 2007. The Centre is owned and managed by the Bali Provincial Department of Health and operated in partnership with the John Fawcett Foundation and its Indonesian arm, the Yayasan Kemanusiaan Indonesia. The Australian Government handed over the ABMEC to the Indonesian Government on 13 October 2015, while renaming it \\"Bali Mandara Eye Hospital\\". Staff from the Lions Eye Institute in Perth, Western Australia, were instrumental in setting up the Centre. The Institute's director of nursing, Elizabeth Zambotti, commissioned the facility after playing a key role in its development, while Institute director Professor Ian Constable oversaw training of Indonesian ophthalmologists by LEI staff. In the first two days 160 Indonesian patients were seen and a dozen cataract operations were performed by Indonesian ophthalmologists. Facilities The Centre has a training facility with digital imaging teaching capacity to enhance the surgical skills of young Indonesian and Australian graduate ophthalmologists, providing for academic exchange between Indonesian and Australian ophthalmologists and trainees. Theatres provide digital imaging from microscopic views of eye surgeries for capture, replay and analysis. The wet lab also has video imaging facilities for teaching. It is planned to develop specialized clinics in the Centre for glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy which are on the increase in the Balinese community. The Centre also has optometry facilities with basic manufacturing and assembling capacity to cater for the almost 70 per cent of poor patients who benefit from remedial glasses. In the event of a natural disaster on Bali, the 2,500 sq m two-story building also has the potential to become a first- level trauma centre, as it has two theatres/three-table surgical capacity and high quality sterilization, x-ray and ultrasound facilities. Two mobile eye surgical units are attached to the Centre and cover remote areas on Bali. Each mobile clinic team with one ophthalmic surgeon, four nurses and two drivers can check over 18,000 people with eye problems per year and perform around 1,200 cataract operations.

The movie was made in Shreveport, LA. Plot Maggie Baker (Blonsky) is an overweight 17-year-old girl in a suburban town in South Carolina who suffers being taunted and ridiculed at school and badgered to lose weight by her overbearing mother (Annie Potts) who is worried she will get diabetes like her late father. Maggie and her mother are estranged and do not get along. The movie starts by showing what Maggie goes through every day at school. We discover that her best friend Casey (Lily Holleman) is not as unpopular as Maggie due to her relationship with one of the popular guys. Casey is invited to a party by the boy and accepts the invitation on the premise that Maggie is allowed to come as well. The popular boys cringe but don't say anything. At the party Casey is dragged away by her sort of boyfriend, leaving Maggie alone to be laughed at by the preppy clique, including Liz (Liz McGeever), a very hated but feared girl at school. Liz is the mean girl who bullies Maggie in high school. Maggie gets food down the front of her shirt and retreats to the kitchen to clean it off (only after being photographed eating in an unflattering manner). From the kitchen she can see Casey and her boyfriend making out in the adjacent hallway before her friend Louis (Fabian C. Moreno) greets her. It is clear that Louis has a thing for Maggie and vice versa. Louis leaves and Casey appears at the same time as Tara (Kim Matula) the sweet Queen Bee at school to wipe food off her shirt as well. Tara asks if Maggie is as klutzy as she is which Maggie confirms that she is, saying \\"No, my blouse was just hungry.\\" After she leaves Casey makes a remark about how Tara is only nice so she can win Homecoming Queen to which Maggie replies that it would be nice if she herself were to win Homecoming Queen and not somebody like Tara or her friends. Maggie was punished by her mother, since she was supposed to baby-sit her brother after she came home. Liz overhears and decides to nominate Maggie as a joke. They would take her off the ballot so her friend Tara will take the crown since she is a shoo in to win. The joke is on her though as many students who are sick of the popular kids get excited about Maggie being the queen, including Tara, who is, of course, nominated herself. Maggie easily collects 150 signatures to put her on the ballot (twice as they are stolen the first time around) and becomes an official nominee. Maggie starts campaigning but gets upset one day when she sees Tara's posters out in the hallway and imagines her mom praising Tara's thinness and beauty. She runs home to find comfort food. Meanwhile, Liz vandalizes Tara's posters so the principal will think it's Maggie and take her out of the race. The plan does not work and Tara begins to suspect that her best friend is trying to sabotage Maggie. At voting time, Maggie wins Homecoming Queen, and the popular clique is shocked and rudely sit and glare at Maggie, but Tara looks genuinely happy for the plus-sized beauty queen. It is later revealed that Tara voted for Maggie and not herself. Maggie is bombarded with offers from the press who wish to discuss the experience with her. However, the popular kids are not ready to accept Maggie's win without a fight and plan to get her to resign. Tara's boyfriend Trip (Kyle Russell Clements) and Liz plot to ruin Maggie's homecoming float. When Maggie sits on it the float busts, making it look like Maggie's weight broke it. Tara is outraged as the prank could have seriously injured Maggie and breaks up with Trip not only because of the prank but because she is also fed up with his shallow ways and his inability to look at life beyond High School popularity. She also discovers that Liz only hangs out with her because she's popular and ends their friendship. The other popular girls stop speaking to Liz as well. Maggie goes on television to discuss her win but comes off sounding rude and ungrateful towards her friends and supporters. She has also been ignoring Casey who has been trying to ask Maggie for advice on whether or not she should consummate her relationship with her now boyfriend. Angry, Casey spews out some harsh insults and Maggie shoves her into a row of bikes, getting herself suspended. Maggie has alienated from her friends and no longer wishes to be Homecoming Queen although the school tells her she can. Maggie realizes that she plays the victim and that her harshest critic is herself. She decides to go through being Homecoming Queen even though the reception will most likely be bad and asks Louis to be her King. She reconciles with both her mom and Casey who eagerly cheer her on at the game. Although many people boo her a lot of people cheer for her too. Maggie realizes that she not only won Homecoming Queen but she changed herself as well.

Williams began his coaching career in 1969-1970 at Ashland University, as the head coach of the junior varsity team. Williams became an assistant coach at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in 1971. He remained with the program until 1986. He served as the interim head coach for the Golden Gophers during the 1985-86 season. During his time as an assistant at Minnesota he worked under both Bill Musselman and Jim Dutcher. After two-years away from coaching, Williams returned to the collegiate ranks as an assistant for J.D. Barnett at the University of Tulsa in 1988. He spent two seasons in Tulsa before moving on to San Diego State University, where he was an assistant for three seasons with the Aztecs. In 1992, he became an assistant coach and later associate head coach at University of Nebraska. He later coach at the University of Louisiana- Lafayette and Oklahoma State University. He also spent time with the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves from 2000 to 2002 as an assistant. He later scouted from the Golden State Warriors. In the summer of 2007, Williams was offered an assistant coaching position again with the University of Minnesota, by new head coach Tubby Smith. Williams resigned his position at Oklahoma State. Minnesota's athletic director Joel Maturi nixed the deal allegedly due to NCAA violations from the 1970s and 80s at the University of Minnesota that Williams may have been involved in. In October 2007, Williams filed a lawsuit against the University of Minnesota, alleging that Smith had negligently misrepresented himself as having the authority to hire Williams. Williams was awarded $1.25 million by a jury for lost past and future income on May 26, 2010. The district court reduced this judgment to $1 million under the Minnesota Tort Claims Act. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on appeal, but the state supreme court reversed the decision on grounds that the University did not owe a duty of care to Williams. It was announced in December 2011 that Williams would accept a position as an assistant coach with The University of Memphis.

As in forms on Neopaganism elsewhere, some pagans work as solitary practitioners and others form groups such as covens. Covens may or not be hierarchical, depending on the tradition. Gardnerian and Alexandrian covens tend to be hierarchical, with coven led by a Priest and High Priestess. Reclaiming covens and working groups practise non-hierarchical modes of group dynamics, with group members co-creating rituals and events, although there may be 'facilitators' and other roles allotted at a given gathering. Ceremonial magicians of various traditions are also a growing group within Australian alternative religion, however they generally do not identify as 'pagan'. Nevertheless, there is considerable crossover between the interests of, and membership in, pagan and magical groups.  History  Alexandrian Wiccans and Gardnerian Wiccans arrived in Australia from England and the United States around the late 1960s.  Demographics  In June 2003, Nature Religions, including Druidism, Paganism, Pantheism and Wicca, were described by Phillip Hughes and Sharon Bond as “the fastest growing group of religions in Australia” between 1991 and 2001.Phillip Hughes and Sharon Bond, \\"Nature Religions\\" Pointers, 13.2 (June 2003): 1 In 2018, Paganism and Wicca were also described as among the \\"least urbanised religions in Australia\\". In the 1991 census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 4,353 Australians identified their religion as a Pagan religion including, 1,367 Australians identified their religion as Wicca or Witchcraft.Phillip Hughes and Sharon Bond, \\"Nature Religions\\" Pointers, 13.2 (June 2003): 5 In the 1996 census, 10,052 Australians identified their religion as a Pagan religion including 1,849 people who identified their religion as Wicca or Witchcraft. In the 2001 census, 24,156 people described themselves as Pagan, including 8,755 people who identified their religion as Wicca or Witchcraft. The PAGANdash campaign was started to help government and community get a correct representation of the number of Pagans currently in Australia. Originating from the Pagan Community Projects in Queensland in 2005, the Pagan Awareness Network (PAN) also ran a comprehensive PAGANdash program prior to the 2011 census in Australia. All Pagans were asked to fill in their religion as Pagan-(religion), for example a Wiccan would write Pagan-Wiccan as their religion. In the 2006 census, 29,391 Australians identified their religion as a Pagan religion including 8,207 people who identified their religion as Wicca or Witchcraft. In the 2011 census, 32,083 Australians identified their religion as a Pagan religion including 8,413 people who identified their religion as Wicca or Witchcraft. In the 2016 census, 27,194 Australians identified their religion as a Pagan religion including 6,616 people who identified their religion as Wicca or Witchcraft. The largest affiliation of nature religions were 'Pagan' (15,219; 66% female). 'Wiccan' (6,616; 79% female) and 'Nature Religions not elsewhere classified' (3,075; 65% male); the largest affiliation by age, were 'Nature Religions not elsewhere classified' (25–29 years), 'Nature Religions, not further defined' (40–44 years), 'Pagan' (40–44 years), 'Wiccan' (45–49 years), 'Animism' (50–54 years) and 'Druidism' (50–59 years).

Harvest) Cover design by Paul Rand The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry is a 1947 collection of essays by Cleanth Brooks. It is considered a seminal textGerald Graff, Poetic Statement and Critical Dogma, 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980, (pp. 87-111) in the New Critical school of literary criticism. The title contains an allusion to the fourth stanza of John Donne's poem, \\"The Canonization\\", which is the primary subject of the first chapter of the book. Introduction The Well Wrought Urn is divided into eleven chapters, ten of which attempt close readings of celebrated English poems from verses in Shakespeare's Macbeth to Yeats's \\"Among School Children\\". The eleventh, famous chapter, entitled \\"The Heresy of Paraphrase,\\" is a polemic against the use of paraphrase in describing and criticizing a poem. This chapter is followed by two appendices: \\"Criticism, History, and Critical Relativism\\" and \\"The Problem of Belief.\\" Most of the book's contents had been previously published before 1947, and the position it articulates is not significantly different from Brooks's earlier books, Understanding Poetry and Modern Poetry and the Tradition. The unique contribution of The Well Wrought Urn is that it combines the close reading analysis of the previous volumes while answering some of the criticism directed at Brooks's theory.Winchell, Mark, Cleanth Brooks and the Rise of Modern Criticism. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1996 The book was written in reaction to a prominent stream of literary criticism: the historicist/biographical.Spurlin, William J. and Fischer, Michael. The New Criticism and Contemporary Literary Theory. New York: Garland Publishing, 1995 (p. 219) This interprets each poetic work within the context of the historical period from which it emerged. Because literary tastes change so much over time, it seems reasonable to the historicist to evaluate each writer according to the standards of his own age. Brooks vehemently rejected this historical relativism, believing it amounts to \\"giving up our criteria of good and bad\\" and thus repudiating \\"our concept of poetry itself\\".Brooks, Cleanth. The Well Wrought Urn, New York: Harcourt Brace, 1947 (p. 198) Brooks opts instead to offer \\"universal judgments\\" of poems and treat them as self-contained entities, able to be interpreted without recourse to historical or biographical information. As H.L. Heilman writes, > to declare the literary work self-contained or autonomous was less to deny > its connections with the nonliterary human world, past and present, than to > assert metaphorically the presence in the poem of suprahistorical uniqueness > along with the generic or the hereditary or the culturally > influenced.Heilman, Robert Bechtold. The Southern Connection. Baton Rouge: > Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1991 (p.138) By distinguishing the \\"supra-historical\\" from the \\"non-historical\\", Heilman highlights an important, and often misunderstood distinction in New Criticism. This is that Brooks and the New Critics did not discount the study of the historical context of the literary work, nor its affective potential for the reader, nor its connection to the life experiences of the author. As he wrote in his essay The Formalist Critics, such study is valuable, but should not be confused with criticism of the work itself. It can be performed as validly for bad works as good ones. In fact, it can be performed for any expression, nonliterary or literary. Thus an historical/biographical study of literature fails on two counts: it cannot tell good literature from bad, and cannot distinguish literature from other cultural productions. Close reading The bulk of the book is devoted to close reading of poems by John Donne, Shakespeare, Milton, Alexander Pope, William Wordsworth, Keats, Lord Tennyson, Yeats, Thomas Gray, and T. S. Eliot. In The Well Wrought Urn, theory illuminates practice and vice versa. The poems are meant to be \\"the concrete examples on which generalizations are to be based\\". Thus the first chapter tells us in its title that poetic language is \\"The Language of Paradox\\". > It is a language in which the connotations play as great a part as the > denotations. And I do not mean that the connotations are important as > supplying some sort of frill or trimming, something external to the real > matter in hand. I mean that the poet does not use a notation at all—as the > science may be properly be said to do so. The poet, within limits, has to > make his language as he goes. Unlike the scientist, who seeks to cleanse his work of all ambiguity, the poet thrives on it because with it he can better express experience. The rest of the first chapter is devoted to the close reading of Donne's \\"The Canonization\\". Brooks in his interpretation challenges the conception of Donne as being an early example of the use of eccentric metaphor, anticipating Yeats and Eliot, instead asserting that he is an extreme example of what all good poetry exemplifies, namely, paradox. Brooks does this by comparing the symbolic imagery of Donne's verse with that of Shakespeare in Macbeth. In order to prove that the language of poetry is paradox, he must treat poems that have traditionally been thought straightforward. He takes Herrick's poem, \\"Corinna's going a-Maying\\", and reveals that the speaker in the poem has a complex attitude toward his carpe diem theme. In doing so, Brooks brings up another central tenet of his critical theory, one which he will deal with more explicitly in the coming chapters: the notion that no true poem can ever be reduced to its paraphrasable prose content. In a similar vein, Brooks analyzes Thomas Gray's \\"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\\". The message of this poem seems straightforward and was duplicated by many other \\"graveyard\\" poems of the late eighteenth century. Therefore, according to Brooks, what makes it one of the most famous in the English language cannot be the poem's message. Brooks instead focuses on the poem's dramatic context as the source of its power. The most famous and best-known application of this doctrine of dramatic appropriateness is Brooks's analysis of Keats's \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\". Widely considered to be one of his best poems, Keats's \\"Ode\\" ends on what many think a sententious note with its proclamation that \\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\\" But Brooks sees this as dramatically appropriate; it is a paradox that cannot be understood except in terms of the entire poem, if we take seriously Keats's metaphor of the urn as a dramatic speaker. Part of the intent of The Well Wrought Urn is to dispel the criticism that Brooks in his earlier works had dismissed the eighteenth and nineteenth century English poets, particularly the Romantics. Brooks thus includes \\"Intimations of Immortality\\" by Wordsworth and \\"Tears, Idle Tears\\" by Tennyson along with the Pope, Gray, and Keats poems. He claims that Wordsworth and Tennyson frequently wrote better (i.e., more paradoxically) than even they were aware. Wordsworth sought to write directly and forcefully, without sophistry or wordplay. But his language is, according to Brooks, nevertheless paradoxical. For example, Brooks takes the opening lines of Wordsworth's sonnet, \\"It is a Beauteous Evening, Calm and Free:\\" > It is a beauteous evening, calm and free, The holy time is quiet as a Nun, > Breathless with adoration... Brooks points out that while the evening is described as quiet and calm, it is also breathless with apparent excitement. There is no final contradiction between this kind of excitement and this kind of calm, but the meaning of the words are being modified by each other, moving away from their purely denotative meaning. This is a good example of what \\"paradox\\" means to Brooks: the poet expresses himself in words that are metaphorical and thus protean in their meaning, that contradict one another because of their connotations. Brooks thus uses the same criteria to analyze and judge these poems as he did for the modern and metaphysical verse. This was a rejection of the typical method of interpretation for these poets, which is to judge them by the Romantic standards of their day and in the light of their biographies. \\"The Heresy of Paraphrase\\" In his summary chapter, Brooks articulates his position that it is \\"heresy\\" to paraphrase a poem when trying to get at its meaning. Poems are not simply \\"messages\\" expressed in flowery language. The language is crucial in determining the message; form is content. Thus to try to abstract the meaning of a poem from the language in which that meaning is rooted, the paradoxical language of metaphor, is to disregard the internal structure of the poem that gives it its meaning. The temptation to think of poetry as prose draped in poetic language is strong simply because both are composed with words and differ only in that poetry has meter and rhyme. But Brooks instead wants us to see poetry as like music, a ballet, or a play: > The structure of a poem resembles that of a ballet or musical composition. > It is a pattern of resolutions and balances and harmonizations, developed > through a temporal scheme...most of us are less inclined to force the > concept of 'statement' on drama than on a lyric poem; for the very nature of > drama is that of something 'acted out'—something which arrives at its > conclusion through conflict—something which builds conflict into its very > being. The poem is a \\"working out of the various tensions—set up by whatever means-by propositions, metaphors, symbols\\". It achieves a resolution through this working out of tensions, not necessarily a logical resolution but a satisfactory unification of different \\"attitudes\\", or dispositions towards experience. Therefore, any intellectual proposition within the poem must be viewed in the context of all the other propositions expressed in the highly changeable language of metaphor. The poem does not try to find the truth-value of a particular idea; it tries to juxtapose many, contradictory ideas together and reach a sort of resolution. The poet is trying to \\"unify experience\\" by making poetry not a statement about experience but an experience itself, with all the contradictory elements contained in one cultural expression, i.e., the poem.

After losing the first three games, the Maple Leafs won the next four to win the series 4–3, winning their fourth Stanley Cup. It was the first Cup Final in history to go seven. Paths to the Finals Toronto defeated the New York Rangers in a best-of-seven 4–2 to advance to the finals. The Red Wings had to play two best-of three series; winning 2–1 against the Montreal Canadiens, and 2–0 against the Boston Bruins. Game summaries A Leafs goal during the series This was a series that saw a remarkable comeback. Toronto came back from a 3–0 series deficit to win the best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final. The feat has only been duplicated three times in Stanley Cup play since, but never in the Stanley Cup Finals. The first game was held in Toronto. Detroit's Don Grosso opened the scoring in the second minute before John McCreedy tied it for Toronto. Sid Abel put the Wings ahead, only to have Sweeney Schriner tie it to leave the teams tied after the first period. Grosso scored again at the 14:11 mark of the second and the Wings held off the Leafs from there to win the opening game 3-2. Detroit took the second game in Toronto by a score of 4–2. Don Grosso scored two goals again for the Red Wings. The Wings took the lead 2–0 after the first period on goals by Grosso and Mud Bruneteau. Schriner scored in the second for the Leafs to close the score to 2–1 after two periods. Grosso scored early in the third along with Gerry Brown to put the Wings ahead 4–1 before Wally Stanowski scored in the fifteenth minute for the Leafs. Detroit held off the Leafs from there to take the series lead 2–0. In game three in Detroit, the Maple Leafs took an early 2–0 lead on goals by Lorne Carr, but the Wings evened the score before the end of the first period on goals by Gerry Brown and Joe Carveth. Late in the first period, Sid Abel had to leave the game with a possible fractured jaw. His replacement, Pat McReavy, scored the winning goal early in the second, and Syd Howe added another to put the Wings up 4–2 after two. Eddie Bush scored for the Wings in the third to push the final score to 5–2. In the fourth game, held in Detroit, the Maple Leafs staved off elimination with a 4–3 victory. Toronto coach Hap Day pulled Gordie Drillon and Bucko McDonald, replacing them with Don Metz and Hank Goldup. There was no scoring in the first. Bruneteau and Abel scored to put the Wings ahead 2–0 before the second period was half over. The Leafs tied it up on goals by Bob Davidson and Carr to leave the teams even after two periods. Carl Liscombe scored in the fifth minute of the third to put the Wings ahead, but two minutes later Syl Apps tied it up. Nick Metz scored the winning goal for Toronto with seven minutes to play. The game ended in a near-riot. In the final minute, Detroit's Eddie Wares drew a misconduct penalty and then a $50 fine for arguing and refusing to leave the ice. Referee Mel Harwood dropped the puck for the faceoff while Wares was still on the ice and promptly called a too-many-men penalty on Don Grosso. Grosso threw down his stick and gloves and was fined $25 by Harwood. At the end of the game Detroit coach Jack Adams then attacked Harwood, punching him in the face following an profanity-laced outburst. The fans booed the officiating, littering the ice with paper, peanuts, and even a woman's shoe. NHL president Frank Calder and referee Harwood were escorted out of the rink under police protection. Calder immediately suspended Adams indefinitely and imposed $100 fines on Grosso and Wares. The teams returned to Toronto for the fifth game. Ebbie Goodfellow took over the coaching duties for the suspended Jack Adams. Leafs' coach Day had worked out Drillon and McDonald but chose to leave them out and his decision was vindicated. The game was a mismatch as the Leafs won 9–3 behind three goals and two assists from Don Metz. Nick Metz scored the first goal and Stanowski scored a second to put the Leafs ahead 2–0 after one period. In the second period, the Leafs scored five goals. Bob Goldham, followed by Schriner, Don Metz, Apps, and Don Metz again raised the score to 7–0 after two. In the third period, Howe put Detroit on the board but Don Metz and Apps scored before Alex Motter and Carl Liscombe scored for the Red Wings to finish the scoring. Game six presented a chance for Detroit to win the Cup on home ice. Although the team had lost the momentum of the series, the Detroit players promised it would be a different outcome from game five, especially the first period, where the Wings had drawn penalties leading to two power-play goals by the Leafs. The teams both showed a lot of discipline in the game and no penalties were called. The closest to an incident came in the third period when Jack Stewart of the Wings and Bingo Kampman of the Leafs collided and almost came to blows. At that time a fan threw a three-pound perch to the ice. The first period was described as \\"hard- hitting hockey\\" and the teams ended the period scoreless. Just 14 seconds after the start of the second, Don Metz stole the puck near the Detroit goal and beat Johnny Mowers to put the Leafs ahead. Turk Broda held off the Red Wings for the rest of the game to record the series' only shutout. Goldham and Billy Taylor scored goals 32 seconds apart late in the third period to clinch the game for the Maple Leafs, who now were being considered the favourites to win the series in the seventh game. The seventh and deciding game was again a close game. Detroit survived a two-man disadvantage in the first period and the teams finished the period tied at zero. Detroit's Syd Howe opened the scoring in the second period on a pretty passing play between Abel, Jimmy Orlando, and Howe. The Wings were determined to protect the lead and led after two periods 1–0. Toronto got its chance in the third period to tie the score when Orlando drew a tripping penalty on Apps. Just as the penalty expired, Schriner scored for Toronto in a goalmouth scramble to tie the game. After the goal, Toronto picked up the pace, eventually out-shooting Detroit 16–7 in the third. Pete Langelle scored the series winner two minutes later in another goalmouth scramble. Schhriner scored the third goal for the Leafs at the 16:13 mark to close out the scoring and the unprecedented comeback win was complete. It was the first time a crowd of over 16,000 attended a hockey game in Canada. 16,218 fans squeezed into Maple Leaf Gardens and remained for an hour after the game waiting for the Leafs to reappear from the dressing room after the game. Coach Day, who had played for the Leafs in their last win in 1932, deadpanned \\"We won it the hard way.\\" He was asked if he had any doubts during the series, and replied \\"I had my doubts right up until that final bell rang.\\" Rookie Gaye Stewart, who had joined the club for the fifth game of the final, became the youngest player to win the Stanley Cup as he was still 18 years of age. John McCreedy completed his triple championship with the win. He was a member of the Winnipeg Monarchs' 1937 Memorial Cup win and won an Allan Cup with the Kirkland Lake Blue Devils.

Creation Maria I of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, was the first monarch of the Kingdom of Brazil. The legal entity of the Kingdom of Brazil was created by a law issued by Prince Regent John of Portugal, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza, in name of his mother, Queen Maria I of Portugal, on 16 December 1815, which elevated the State of Brazil to the rank of a Kingdom within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves. By a decree issued on 22 April 1821 ahead of his departure from Brazil to Portugal, King John VI appointed his firstborn son and heir, Prince Pedro of Braganza, the Prince Royal of the United Kingdom, as Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil, with delegated powers to discharge the \\"general government and entire administration of the Kingdom of Brazil\\" as the King's placeholder, thus granting the Kingdom of Brazil a devolved administration within the United Kingdom. Dissolution John VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, was the last monarch of the Kingdom of Brazil. On 7 September 1822, Prince Pedro, Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, Regent of Brazil, declared the Brazilian Independence. On 12 October 1822, Prince Pedro became the first Emperor of the newly independent country, thus founding the Empire of Brazil. Brazil's independence was only recognized with the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro, in 1825, by which the Kingdom of Brazil, within the larger United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, was formally dissolved and Brazil's independence was recognized and granted by the Kingdom of Portugal. On 8 September 1822, in the first day after the Proclamation of Independence, Prince Pedro issued a decree to adopt for the Kingdom of Brazil a new flag and coat of arms, replacing the Portuguese colours, then white and blue, with new colours, green and yellow (green was chosen for its association with the House of Braganza, Pedro's dynasty; yellow was chosen as it was the colour of the House of Habsburg, in which Pedro's wife, Leopoldina, was born; the new national colours therefore honoured the Royal couple that led Brazil at the foundation of its independence); those new symbols would later pass to the Empire of Brazil when it was founded on 12 October 1822. The new, post independence symbols, replaced the original flag of the Kingdom of Brazil (a golden armillary sphere on a blue field) and its original coat of arms (a golden armillary sphere with a blue background in the interior of the sphere), that had been designed in 1815. Of course, after independence, upon the adoption of the new flag and coat of arms on 8 September 1822, the coat of arms of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, adopted in 1815 (featuring a juxtaposition of the traditional coat of arms of Portugal and the Algarves with the original coat of arms of the Kingdom of Brazil in the background, surmounted by the royal crown), also ceased to be used. As per one of the clauses of the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro, King John VI of Portugal and the Algarves, formerly King John VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, was granted the personal title of titular Emperor of Brazil, thus having stayed monarch of Brazil, in title, until his death in 1826.

However, as a teen Nugent grew into ingenue parts on television and in B-films. She was a supporting actress throughout her career, which tapered off sharply after she married and had children. =Personal life= Nugent married actor Nick Adams in 1959, after they dated for a short time. She appeared in a guest role for his television series The Rebel that year. They had two children together, Allyson Lee Adams and Jeb Stuart Adams. In a 1961 interview Adams said, \\"Carol is my good-luck charm. My first real success, the turn of the tide, came right after I fell in love with her. Then I formed my own production company and we sold The Rebel.\\"Kathleen Post, TV Radio Mirror, July 1961, Vol 56 No 2 p.66. However, in the same interview Nugent said, \\"Let's not overdo the sweetness and light. Naturally, Nick and I had our problems at the start\\". Gossip columnist Rona Barrett later wrote that Nugent \\"was one of the most refreshing wives in the entire community.\\"Barrett, Rona, Miss Rona (1974) In 1965, seemingly without warning, during a promotional television appearance on The Les Crane Show, Adams announced he was leaving her. This began a very public period of bitter separations and temporary reconciliations which lasted until his death in 1968. Nugent filed for divorce and custody of the children went back and forth between her and Adams but she was listed as his spouse on the death certificate and when he died she was living with their two children only a few blocks from his house in Beverly Hills. In 2002 Nugent renewed her acquaintance with John G. Stephens who had been production manager on the 1960s television series My Three Sons. Her father Carl had been property master for the show. Stephens' wife, actress Joan Vohs (1927–2001), had recently died from heart failure. Stephens and Nugent married in 2002.

Redistricting In November 2005, the electorate rejected Proposition 77 which called for a panel of three retired judges to draw boundaries for California's Senate, Assembly, Congressional and Board of Equalization districts. It had been viewed with suspicion due to its Republican backers. FairVote suggested that independent redistricting would help avoid gerrymandering, but the major reform needed was the replacement of single member districts with multi-member districts. This would make it possible to implement single transferable vote or other proportional representation systems.Proposition 77 Fails - But Voters Still Want Reform , FairVote. In November 2008, voters in California passed Proposition 11 to reform how electoral districts are drawn in the state. The proposition called for a commission of fourteen non-politician voters to draw boundaries for the Senate, Assembly, and Board of Equalization districts. The commission is to be made up of five Democrats, five Republicans, and four commissioners from neither major party. In November 2010, Proposition 20 was passed, which put the commission in charge of drawing United States House of Representatives districts in California. Nonpartisan blanket primaries In the June 2010 elections, voters approved Proposition 14, establishing the nonpartisan blanket primary as the election method for state and federal offices except for local, non-partisan, and presidential elections.

The region produces mainly white wines, and the vineyards in the region number around 50. The harvest time is between late February and early April. Climate and geography The climate of the region is Mediterranean, suitable for the growth of white wine vines including Chardonnay and Riesling, as well as red wine grapes like Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. This climate is characterised by moderate temperatures, with rainfall more predominant in the winter months and relatively dry summer months. However, winter frosts occasionally extend through into early spring, which can cause damage to the vines. The region varies in elevation, from 100 metres in the west to 340 metres in the east. The annual rainfall range is from 600 to 900 millimetres. The soil in the area is heavily dictated by the topography.

Overview Such performers are usually dedicated enthusiasts of a particular musical genre – often a style that is no longer in vogue – and act as evangelists to spread awareness and appreciation of that music to new audiences. Most such acts do this by live performances at a variety of venues. Unlike tribute acts who are usually dedicated to recreating material associated with just one primary artist (such as Elvis Presley or The Beatles) as a nostalgic entertainment, revivalist artists tend to draw on material from a wide range of artists and writers from the chosen musical genre. Unlike cover bands who are primarily populist entertainers playing cover versions of popular hit songs to satisfy audience enjoyment of familiar music, revivalist artists usually see themselves as performers with a musical mission to revive a cherished genre. They often draw from a much broader repertoire of music than just the obvious hit songs of an era. Sometimes the mission includes drawing the audience's attention to forgotten or overlooked songs from the genre as well as the better-known hits. Most revivalist artists focus on performing material only from the original era that they are reviving. They replenish their repertoire by digging deeper in the catalogue of music from their chosen genre. Some artists eventually aspire to write new material in a similar style and become known for their own compositions.

Lược sử quân lực Việt Nam Cộng hòa. Hương Quê. . (pg 155-158) was a general of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. He was the brother-in-law of General Trần Văn Đôn and together with General Dương Văn Minh, the trio organised the 1963 South Vietnamese coup which toppled President Ngô Đình Diệm and ended in the assassinations of Diệm and his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu.  Career Kim began his career in the French Army, before transferring to the Vietnamese National Army of the State of Vietnam, and was the Chief of Staff of the 4th Infantry Division during the First Indochina War.Hickey, p. 56.. He supported Diem during the power struggle against the Binh Xuyen in 1955. Kim was regarded to be the most adept tactician in the ARVN's most skilled tactician, but soon fell out of favour with Diem. In the early years of the Diem regime, Kim was directing the Land Development Program in the central highlands, Kim decided to financially compensate highlanders tribes whose land had been confiscated, which the palace disapproved of. The regime felt it was sufficient to compensate the tribal villagers with livestock or alcohol.Hickey, p. 67. During this period, Diem also survived a Vietcong assassination attempt in the highlands town of Ban Me Thuot, when a communist cadre opened fire at an agricultural fair.Miller, p. 185. It was speculated by historian Edward Miller that the regime may have blamed Kim for the security failure.Miller, p. 208. Kim was then promoted brigadier general, but it was believed that Diem did to allow for Kim to become head of the Vietnamese National Military Academy, which was regarded as 'dead-end job' with no troops to command.  1960 coup attempt  On November 11, 1960, paratroopers from the Airborne Division led by Nguyen Chanh Thi launched a coup attempt against Diem, and they quickly gained the upper hand before hesitating and negotiating, allowing Diem the opportunity to call in loyalists to rescue him.Miller, pp. 202--208. During this period, the rebels unilaterally named Kim as their new prime minister. After Diệm regained control, Kim was later put under house arrest.Dommen, pp. 418--419. According to Đôn, Kim was willing to accept the post but was going to stay silent unless the coup succeeded.Kahin, p. 473. Despite being cleared of wrongdoing, he was removed from his post as the director of the National Military Academy and transferred to Minh's unit.Miller, p. 210.  Junta  Kim was one of the leading figures in Minh's junta, and as the chief of general staff.Shaplen, pp. 231-232. During the latter part of Diệm's rule, a centerpiece of the rural pacification campaign was the large-scale construction of strategic hamlets, fortified camps that were designed to lock out insurgents. However this failed as many were able to infiltrate the settlements, as political affiliation could not be distinguished. It also angered the peasants, who were forced to abandon their ancestral lands and homes, and build new dwellings in the new villages. Many of these hamlets were subsequently overrun in communist attacks.Karnow, pp. 272–276.Tang, pp. 45–50.Langguth, pp. 168–170.Jacobs, pp. 125–130. Kim oversaw the future of the program for Minh and they decided to liberalize the system to try to win over the peasants. They forecast that they could reduce the insurgency's support by 30% alone through these less restrictive arrangements, citing more cooperative attitudes in Mekong Delta regions heavily populated with Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài. However this upset and aroused suspicions among the Americans.Kahin, p. 187. = Overthrow = A group of officers, led by Generals Nguyen Khanh, Tran Thien Khiem and Do Mau were unhappy with their posts after the 1963 coup, and began plotting. They used Kim's assistant, General Duong Van Duc to concoct incriminating documents to purportedly show that Generals Minh, Kim and Đôn had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were brought to the attention of some senior American officials.Shaplen, p. 232. Khánh told various American officials that Đôn, Kim and General Mai Hữu Xuân, along with Minh, were \\"pro-French and pro-neutralist\\" and part of French President Charles de Gaulle's plan to neutralise Vietnam. Khánh claimed that the fact that Đôn had invited two members of the French National Assembly—both from de Gaulle's party—to dinner. According to one source, Kim and Minh were also present, while another said that Kim, Đính and Xuân were there.Kahin, p. 197.Logevall, p. 162. Khánh alleged at the time that the generals discussed neutralization there, while Đôn and Đính always denied it.Kahin, p. 198. Lodge passed a report to Washington on January 20, in which he said that Đôn and Kim retained their French citizenship and \\"had never at any time foresworn the possibility of a neutral solution at what might seem to them the proper time.\\"Blair, p. 113. He said that although he thought their policies against the communists were effective, \\"none of us had ever discussed what the next step would be after the Government of Vietnam had reached a position of strength. Perhaps they did favor the French neutrality solution at that time.\\" On January 30, Khánh launched a coup, arresting Minh, Dinh, Đôn and Kim, claiming that they were part of a neutralist plot with the Việt Cộng and taken to Đà Lạt. Khánh noted that they had served in the Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, under the French colonial administration, although he did as well. An anonymous source close to the plotters told The New York Times that \\"We were anxious about them indeed...and we had conclusive proof that they had been talking with the French in terms of a neutralized Vietnam and that North Vietnam had given support to the plan\\", explicitly naming Kim and Xuân. In May 1964, Khanh put his rivals on trial. The generals were secretly interrogated for five and a half hours, mostly about details of their coup against Diệm, rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in the plot against Diệm, this did not reveal any information new to them. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, \\"We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody\\".Langguth, pp. 289–291. The tribunal then \\"congratulated\\" the generals, but found that they were of \\"lax morality\\" and unqualified to command due to a \\"lack of a clear political concept\\".Blair, p. 115. They were chastised for being \\"inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility\\" and of letting \\"their subordinates take advantage of their positions\\". The four imprisoned generals were allowed to remain in Da Lat under surveillance with their families. However, there were reports that the trial ended in a festive manner akin to a party, as the officers shook hands and made up with one another. All four generals were barred from commanding troops for a period; Kim was banned for six years. Offices were prepared for the quartet so that they could participate in \\"research and planning\\". Worried that the group of idle officers would plot against him, Khánh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the United States for military study, but this fell through.Shaplen, pp. 244–245.Karnow, p. 355. When Khánh was himself deposed in 1965, he handed over dossiers proving that the four generals were innocent;Langguth, p. 347. the original documents that Khánh claimed proved his accusations of neutralism were neither presented to nor found by anyone. During the period of house arrest, Khánh briefly released Đính and Kim when the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races, known by its French acronym of FULRO, launched an uprising in the central highlands calling for autonomy for indigenous people. Đính and Kim were sent to Ban Mê Thuột in an attempt to end the standoff in September 1964, but after negotiations stalled, they conferred with Khánh and decided to order ARVN troops to crush the rebellion, which was carried out successfully.Hickey, pp. 154–60.

Xuân started his career in the Vietnamese National Army of the French-backed State of Vietnam and worked in military security and was made an ARVN general, but was later put into a minor job by Diệm. During the coup against Diệm, Xuân led trainee enlisted men in a successful attack on the headquarters of the National Police, and the secret police. Xuân then led a group that arrested Diệm and his younger brother and chief adviser, Ngô Đình Nhu, after their hiding place was discovered. During the trip back to headquarters, the Ngô brothers were assassinated, leading to a debate over who gave the order. Prior to 1963, Xuân was a member of the ruling junta, and served as the Mayor of Saigon and the head of the National Police, during which time he was accused of arresting people for ransom. After three months, the junta was overthrown by General Nguyễn Khánh and Xuân was arrested along with Generals Trần Văn Đôn, Lê Văn Kim and Tôn Thất Đính, accused of plotting to make peace with the communists and making South Vietnam a neutral state. Khánh was able to find evidence and his military tribunal convicted them of \\"lax morality\\", and being unqualified to command due to a \\"lack of a clear political concept\\". Xuân and his colleagues were put under house arrest for a period, before being released and compulsorily retired after a service limit was introduced. Early career Xuân served under Prime Minister Nguyễn Văn Tâm during the French-backed State of Vietnam era in the 1950s in military security.Hammer, p. 125. When Diệm became Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam, Xuân fought for him as an officer in the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) in the Battle for Saigon in May 1955, against the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate that sought to take over the capital.Hammer, p. 298. The VNA dismantled the Bình Xuyên and Xuân was made a general. Xuân turned against Diệm after he was relegated to a minor job, and he readily joined the plot against Diệm as opposition to his rule grew in 1963.Karnow, p. 325. Diệm assassination The ARVN conducted a coup against Diệm on 1 November 1963, and Xuân led some of the units. He used some newly enlisted troops from the Quang Trung Training Camp to capture the headquarters of the National Police, which included the secret police under the direct control of Diệm's brother and adviser, Nhu. The next morning Diệm and Nhu, who had escaped from the siege on the palace, agreed to surrender. The coup leader, General Dương Văn Minh dispatched a convoy to pick them up from their hideout in Cholon. The convoy was led by Xuân and consisted of Colonels Nguyễn Văn Quan and Dương Ngọc Lắm. Quan was Minh's deputy, and Lắm had been the commander of Diệm's Civil Guard until defecting mid-way through the coup once a rebel victory seemed assured. Two further officers made up the convoy: Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa and Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, Minh's bodyguard.Hammer, pp. 297-98. When the officers arrived, Diệm requested that the convoy stop at the palace so that he could gather personal items before being exiled. Xuân turned him down, clinically stating that his orders were to take the brothers directly to headquarters. Nhu expressed disgust that they were to be transported in an armoured personnel carrier (APC), asking \\"You use such a vehicle to drive the president?\\" Xuân said that it was selected to protect them from \\"extremists\\". Xuân ordered the brothers' hands be tied behind their backs before shoving them into the carrier. One officer asked to shoot Nhu, but Xuân turned him down. He didn't want to kill Nhu at that point as he purportedly intended to torture Nhu for money.Jones, p. 429. After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa sat with the Ngô brothers in the APC. Before dispatching the convoy, Minh was reported to have gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken as the order to kill the Ngô brothers. As the convoy on the route to the General Headquarters, Xuân ordered the APC to stop over at a National Police station where he brutally tortured Nhu and Diệm, asking them where they had hidden money. When they refused to release the information, Xuân killed them with his pistol. An investigation by Đôn later determined Nghĩa shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife without realizing that both the brothers had already been killed by Xuân.Karnow, p. 326. The generals were shocked to see the dead bodies and Đôn ordered another officer to tell reporters that the brothers had died in an accident. He went to confront Minh in his office. : Đôn: Why are they dead? : Minh: And what does it matter that they are dead? At this time, Xuân walked into Minh's office through the open door, unaware of Đôn's presence. Xuân snapped to attention and stated \\"Mission accomplie\\". Although the blame was widely placed on Minh, U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. thought that Xuân was partly culpable asserting that \\"Diệm and Nhu had been assassinated, if not by Xuân personally, at least at his direction.\\" Jones, p. 436. Junta and overthrow Under the military junta, Xuân served as the national police chief. He was accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty.Shaplen, p. 221. Xuân did not survive long in his new post. General Khánh, disgruntled that Minh and the other leading generals did not offer him a position in the 12-man junta, began to plot. Khánh was transferred to command I Corps, based around Huế and Đà Nẵng in the far north of Vietnam.Karnow, pp. 354-55.Shaplen, p. 230. Khánh had wanted a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, close to the political intrigue. Khánh joined forces with other ambitious officers who resented the MRC for giving jobs they felt were insignificant. These included Brigadier General Đỗ Mậu, the Minister of Information, Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi, and General Khiệm, who had been demoted from being Chief of Staff of the ARVN to the commander of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon, which meant that he controlled the troops near the capital.Shaplen, p. 231.Karnow, p. 352. At the time, French President Charles de Gaulle was contemplating recognising the People's Republic of China and wanted Southeast Asia neutralised as part of his agenda to cultivate relations with the communist bloc. De Gaulle wanted the United States out of South Vietnam.Shaplen, pp. 232-33. Khánh told various American officials that Generals Xuân, Đôn, Minh, and Lê Văn Kim were \\"pro-French and pro-neutralist\\" and part of de Gaulle's plan.Logevall, p. 162. Before dawn on 30 January, Khánh and his colleagues seized power in a bloodless coup before dawn, catching the MRC completely off guard.Shaplen, p. 233. Khánh had Xuân arrested, along with Minh, Đôn, Kim and Tôn Thất Đính, claiming that they were part of a neutralist plot with the French. Khánh noted they had served in the French-backed Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, although he had done so as well. The generals were flown to My Khe beach, near Đà Nẵng and placed under house arrest. Retribution by Khánh Khánh tried Xuân and his colleagues in May. The generals were interrogated for five and a half hours, mostly about details of the coup against Diệm, rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism. As Khánh was involved in the plot as well, this did not reveal any new information. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, \\"We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody\\".Langguth, pp. 289-91. The tribunal then \\"congratulated\\" Xuân and his colleagues, but found that they were of \\"lax morality\\", unqualified to command due to a \\"lack of a clear political concept\\". Xuân and his fellow generals were chastised for being \\"inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility\\" and of letting \\"their subordinates take advantage of their positions\\". They were allowed to remain in Đà Lạt under surveillance with their families. Xuân was barred from commanding troops, as were his colleagues. An office was prepared so that he could participate in \\"research and planning\\". Worried that Xuân and his idle colleagues would plot against him, Khánh made arrangements to send them to the United States for military study, but this fell through.Shaplen, pp. 244-45.Karnow, p. 355. In any case, the younger generation of officers forcibly retired Xuân and the other generals by making it compulsory for officers to retire after 25 years of military service. When Khánh was himself deposed in 1965, he handed over dossiers proving that Xuân and his colleagues were innocent.Langguth, p. 347.

The plateau forms part of the Great Dividing Range and is sometimes referred to as the Dorrigo and Guy Fawkes Plateau. The highest peak on the plateau is Barren Mountain, at an elevation of . Location and features The plateau is defined by that area bounded in the south by the Dorrigo Escarpment, in the west by the New England Tableland, in the north by Hyland State Forest, Blicks River, Glen Fernaigh Creek and Nymboida River, and in the east by Bielsdown River up to the junction with Mathews Creek, then up to the head of Mathews Creek, then by the watershed extending generally south southeast to Dome Mountain. Located on the eastern edge of the plateau is the town of Dorrigo, north of the Sydney and from the coastal city of Coffs Harbour. Richard Craig was the first European to arrive at the plateau, following the traditional indigenous route to Armidale from the Grafton area. Using his skills as a horseman, Craig travelled along the western side of the Nymboida River. Craig's track became a road, now roughly following the same path as the present Grafton to Armidale Road and travelling through the present day villages of , Billy's Creek, Dundurrabin, Tyringham and , the latter with an elevation of . Timbergetters followed Craig through the sub tropical rainforest and many sawmills grew due to demand for timber, initially the highly prized Australian Red Cedar (Toona australis). Today, the main access road traversing the plateau from east to west is the Waterfall Way. The Dorrigo Plateau and surrounding Guy Fawkes River National Park area was created by successive basaltic lava flows from the Ebor Volcano covering the original granite base. Weathering from high rainfall caused an escarpment to form as the more ancient rocks underneath remained intact.

He was prominent in several coups and juntas in the 1960s. In 1963, Có came to prominence for his role in the November coup that deposed Vietnam's president, Ngô Đình Diệm, who was assassinated. Có's superior, General Tôn Thất Đính, moved him into command of the 7th Division to lock loyalist forces out of Saigon. Có was promoted to brigadier general after the coup, and as South Vietnam was inflicted with a cycle of coups over the next two years, he became more prominent as other generals defeated one another in power struggles. By 1965, Có was the Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister in a junta headed by Prime Minister and Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, the figurehead chief of state. Có came under increasing scrutiny for his exorbitant wealth and was widely seen as corrupt, while Kỳ viewed him as a political threat. In 1967 Kỳ fired Có when both men were overseas on diplomatic visits. Kỳ then organized military forces to prevent Có from flying back, effectively sending him into exile. Over time, Thiệu began to eclipse Kỳ in a power struggle, and allowed Có to return in 1970. Có then stayed out of public life, and worked in banking and business. In 1975, the communists overran the south, and after hesitating in planning his escape from South Vietnam, Có was captured by the communists, who imprisoned him in re-education camps for 12 years. Có decided not to emigrate after being released and lived in Vietnam until his death in 2012. Early career Có was a field commander for the French-backed Vietnamese National Army that fought against Hồ Chí Minh's Việt Minh during the First Indochina War. He led a \\"groupement mobile\\". Diem overthrow He was a participant in the 1963 coup that deposed President Ngô Đình Diệm and ended in his assassination. Colonel Có was the deputy of General Tôn Thất Đính, who commanded the III Corps forces that oversaw the region surrounding the capital Saigon. Halberstam, p. 181. Đính was entrusted to command III Corps because the Ngô family trusted him to defend them in the face of any coup attempts.Blair (2001), p. 56. However, in late 1963, Đính began to plot against Diệm along with a group of generals. As part of the generals' plot, Đính sent Colonel Có to Mỹ Tho to talk to the 7th Division commander, Colonel Bùi Đình Đạm, and two regimental commanders, the armoured unit commander, both of the 7th Division, and the Mỹ Tho provincial chief. At that time, the 7th Division was under the control of the IV Corps that was commanded by Diệm loyalist General Cao. This division was on the outskirts of Saigon and its stance would be critical in determining the success or failure of a coup. Exhorting the 7th Division officers to join the coup on the grounds that the Diệm regime was unable to keep the military going forward, he stated that all the generals except Cao were in the plot, while Đính was going to do so. According to one account, Đính had intended that loyalists would report Có's activities to Diệm and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace and make the coup easier to carry out.Jones, p. 399. Nhu's agents heard of the conversation and reported to the palace. When the Ngô brothers confronted with the report of what had happened in Mỹ Tho, Đính feigned astonishment at his deputy's behavior. He began crying and said \\"This is my fault, because you have suspected me. I have not really gone to work for the last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I am not against you. I was sad because I thought I was discredited with you. So Nguyen Huu Co profited from my absence to make trouble.\\" Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and raised his voice, vowing to have his deputy killed.Moyar, p. 265. Nhu opposed this and said he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to achieve this. Nhu ordered Đính to plan a fake coup against the Ngô family. One of Nhu's objectives was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated.Jones, pp. 398–99. Đính was put in charge of the fake coup and was allowed the additional control of the 7th Division, giving his III Corps complete encirclement of Saigon. This would prevent Cao from storming the capital to save Diệm as he had done during the 1960 coup attempt.Karnow, pp. 307–22..Hatcher, pp. 145–46. Not trusting Có, Diệm put a Catholic loyalist, Colonel Lâm Văn Phát, in command of the 7th Division on 31 October. According to tradition, Phát had to pay the corps commander a courtesy visit before assuming control of the division. Đính refused to see Phát and told him to come back on Friday at 14:00, by which time the real coup had already been scheduled to start. In the meantime, Đính had General Trần Văn Đôn sign a counter-order transferring command of the 7th Division to Có. With a group of his personal rebel officers, Có flew by helicopter to My Thơ, the division headquarters, to take command on the morning of the coup, 1 November. Reaching the Mekong Delta town two hours before the scheduled start of the coup, he held a ceremony for the division's incumbent officers--who thought the change of command was a routine matter -- in a local hall. When the coup started, Có's men charged through the doors with automatic guns and arrested the officers, before taking command. He said \\"Please remain seated quietly. Anyone who rises will be instantly shot\\".Karnow, p. 321. Có then telephoned Cao, further south in the Mekong Delta's largest town Cần Thơ, where the IV Corps was headquartered. The rebel colonel assured Cao that the divisional and corps transfer had taken place smoothly. Có, a central Vietnamese, was afraid that Cao, a Mekong Delta native would recognise his fake southern accent, and realise that he was impersonating Phát, another southerner. However, Cao did not notice the faked accent. When Cao was informed by his subordinates that there was a coup occurring in the capital, he believed in to be part of the false coup, as he had been told beforehand by Nhu; Cao was one of the regime's most loyal and favourites generals and he was going to help stage the second part of Nhu's plan. However, Cao did tell one regiments and a few tanks to ready themselves for the second part of the plot. Late during the night of the coup, Cao realised the coup was genuine. He sent the 9th Division under Colonel Bùi Dzinh to move north through Mỹ Tho towards Saigon to save Diệm but Có had already made plans to cut off any attempt by Cao to relieve Saigon.Moyar, p. 270. When Cao radioed the 7th Division in Mỹ Tho, Có identified himself and taunted the corps commander, saying \\"Didn't you recognise my accent?\\". Có told the general that he had ordered all the ferries to the Saigon side of the Mekong River, and told Cao not to attempt to cross unless he wanted to die. Seeing that Diệm was lost, Cao expressed solidarity with the coup.Jones, p. 409. After the coup succeeded, Có became a general in the ruling Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Có said that Diệm \\"made so many mistakes\\", most notably his strong preferential treatment of Roman Catholics, usually from his native central Vietnam, at the expense of Buddhists. Diệm had generally promoted military officers on loyalty, rather than merit. Junta The MRC led by General Dương Văn Minh was deposed in a January 1964 coup by General Nguyễn Khánh, and he put several leading generals -- Trần Văn Đôn, Tôn Thất Đính and Mai Hữu Xuân -- in jail, but Có was not affected.Shaplen, pp. 228–34. South Vietnam had a series of short-lived juntas, including military-supervised civilian cabinets over the next 18 months. In August 1964, Khánh tried to give himself more power, but this provoked strong protests and forced him to back down into a weaker position than before, and his rule became unstable as more concessions were demanded.Moyar (2004), pp. 760–64. Khánh promised to dissolve the junta and create a National Assembly within a year.Moyar (2004), p. 762. The division among the generals came to a head at a meeting of the junta on 26/27 August, as they blamed each other's policies and machinations for the problems.Kahin, pp. 229–30. Thiệu and Có called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh reportedly claimed that Khánh was the only one who would get funding from Washington, so they supported him, prompting angry arguments as to whether Khánh was a puppet.Moyar (2006), p. 318. After more arguing between the senior officers, they agreed that Khánh, Minh, and Khiệm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new civilian government could be formed. However, the triumvirate did little due to their disunity. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiệm and Minh.Moyar (2004), p. 762. In January 1965, the junta-appointed Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương introduced a series of measures to expand the military and war effort, most notably by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti- Huong demonstrations and riots, mainly from conscription-aged students and pro-negotiations Buddhists.Kahin, pp. 267–69 Reliant on Buddhist support,Moyar (2004), pp. 774–75. Khánh decided to have the armed forces take over, removing Hương on 27 January. Khánh removed Hương in a bloodless coup with the support of Thi and Kỳ. He promised to leave politics once the situation was stabilized and hand over power to a civilian body. It was believed that some of the officers supported Khánh's increased power so that it would give him an opportunity to fail and be removed permanently. Moyar (2006), p. 775. Khánh's deposal of the prime minister nullified a counter-plot involving Hương which developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to preempt his being deposed, Hương had backed a plot led by some Đại Việt-oriented Catholic officers reported to include Generals Có and Thiệu. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiệm back from Washington. The U.S. Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to fully back the move as they regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiệm, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, they only promised asylum for Hương if necessary.Kahin, p. 297. By this time, the U.S. relationship with Khánh had broken down, Kahin, pp. 255–60. and the U.S. became more intent on a regime change as Khánh was reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw as an obstacle to an expansion of the war.Kahin, pp. 294–96. In the first week of February, Taylor told the leading officers that the US was \\"in no way propping up General Khánh or backing him in any fashion\\".Kahin, p. 298. At this stage, the U.S. Embassy thought highly of three officers as possible replacements for Khánh: Thiệu, Có the commander of II Corps and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, Commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy. A U.S. Defense Department report stated that Có was an \\"outstanding officer ... friendly to Americans\\". Kahin, p. 512. At the same time, the CIA knew that Có had become disillusioned with Khánh and had stopped attending junta meetings after Khánh accused him of \\"having been bought off by the Americans\\". However, the relatively cautious Thiệu, Có and Cang's preparations were well behind those of Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, a communist double agent. Kahin, p. 299. Có and the other American-preferred officers maintained a guarded approach, waiting to see what others would do, rather than boldly taking the initiative, and Thảo struck first. The Americans opposed Thảo, and with their support, Kỳ and Thi defeated the coup and then overthrew Khánh as well, becoming the most important officers in the resulting junta. Kahin, pp. 298–302.Shaplen, pp. 310–12.Kahin, p. 303.Langguth, pp. 346–47. In mid-1965, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ became prime minister and General Thiệu as the figurehead president. They headed a 10-man junta of which Có was a part until elections were held in 1967. Có was the Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister. Có was generally regarded as being corrupt. As a general, he had a base pay of US$177 monthly, but he managed to purchase three villas in Saigon and owned property estimated at US$600,000 near Tan Son Nhut Air Base on the capital's outskirts. His wealth was believed to have come from bribes from subordinate officers who wanted postings away from danger, usually desk jobs, as well as charging up to US$3,400 a head for draft evaders, depending on how rich they were. Có was also accused of using his position as defense minister to pocket the rent collected from the American military for building U.S. bases on land rented from the Saigon government. Karnow, p. 457. His wife was known to be a gambling addict during his halcyon days and was reputed to have once lost US$8,500 in one outing. Có was seen as a political threat to Kỳ and a magnet for dissidents. For his part, Có deemed Kỳ to be \\"immature\\". In early 1967, Kỳ sent Có to Taiwan, ostensibly to represent the junta at a ceremony to opening direct air services from Taipei to Saigon. In the meantime, Kỳ made a state visit to Australia. With Có out of the country and unable to stage a coup, and Kỳ not within striking distance in case anyone wanted to capture him, news of Có's removal was broken in Saigon. Có expressed a desire to return to Saigon, but was threatened with arrest and trial, and soldiers were deployed to the airport. Có spent three years in exile in Hong Kong. When President Thiệu sidelined Kỳ from real power, he allowed Có to return to South Vietnam in 1970. Có stayed away from politics and worked as a commercial banker and then as a businessman. Imprisonment by the communists On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell and the communists took control. Có made plans to leave but hesitated and was not evacuated by the US military. He considered leaving by boat, but deemed it too risky with 11 children. In June 1975, Có was told to report to a re-education camp along with the vast majority of public servants and military officers. Có was initially held at Quang Trung Training Camp, about 15 km north of Saigon (later Hồ Chí Minh City), which had been an ARVN training center for newly enlisted men. According to him, the conditions were good, although there were political propaganda lectures. In June 1976, he was suddenly moved by an airplane in the middle of the night to Yên Bái in the north of the country where he was forced to perform manual labor. In 1978, he and some other ARVN generals were relocated to Hà Tây, in the Red River Delta east of the capital Hanoi, where he was imprisoned in an Interior Ministry facility, where he was asked to write what he knew about South Vietnam's military strategies and government mechanisms. In 1979, Có was moved by himself to Nam Ha, where he underwent propaganda lessons and did manual labor alongside military and civilian prisoners. He was returned to Hà Tây to be reunited with the other generals. In 1983 he was moved back to Nam Ha, where he stayed until his release in 1987, after 12 years in captivity. While he was imprisoned, his wife, who had always been a housewife, took her first job, in a knitting factory to support their children. Có decided to remain in Vietnam under communist rule after being released. Death Nguyễn Hữu Có died at his private residence in Saigon on 3 July 2012 after a six-year battle with diabetes. He was interred four days later. He was survived by his wife and children.

Life Aytimur was born into a lowly family,Smith Jr., p 127. probably one of the Turkish ḡolāms that Masʿūd, the previous Sarbadār leader, recruited to supplement his bandit and Shiʿite dervish soldiery.AY TĪMŪR (or TEYMŪR), MOḤAMMAD, Sarbadār commander and ruler, “the son of a slave” (probably one of the Turkish ḡolāms that Masʿūd, the previous Sarbadār leader, recruited to supplement his bandit and Shiʿite dervish soldiery) He rose to prominence within the Sarbadar state as a military commander under Wajih ad-Din Mas'ud, Mas'ud put Aytimur in charge of Sabzewar during his campaign against the Kartids of Herat in 1342, and again when he invaded Mazandaran in 1344 against the Ilkhanid claimant Togha Temur. In the latter campaign, Mas'ud was killed and his army destroyed; Aytimur's control of the capital at the time resulted in him taking command of the Sarbadar government. After the annihilation of the Sarbadar army in Mazandaran, Togha Temur resumed the offensive, reoccupying Astarabad and invading Khurasan. Aytimur was able to stop Togha Temur from encroaching any further on Sarbadar territory, but the weakened state of the army eventually prompted him to seek peace. Aytimur agreed to resume the Sarbadars' allegiance to Togha Temur and minted coins in the latter's name, abandoning Mas'ud's alliance with the Chobanids in the process (this alliance had become useless to Aytimur anyway, as the Chobanids were in the midst of a civil war at this time following the death of Hasan Kucek). By this time the Sarbadar state had been reduced to Sabzewar, Nishapur and its environs. Despite the peace, Aytimur still remained wary of Togha Temur. The latter's military advantage against the Sarbadars was somewhat reduced by the defection of one of his most powerful allies, the Jauni Kurban tribe, in 1345 after the death of its leader Arghun Shah. Nevertheless, the need to maintain a perimeter defense against his nominal sovereign meant that Aytimur had to deploy most of the army to the frontier. Sending the army out of Sabzewar to defend against Togha Temur proved fatal to Aytimur. Most of his supporters were in the regular army; without them he had little support. To rebuild the military forces of the Sarbadars, he had requested the assistance of the radical Shi'i dervishes, but they were hostile to him and as they built up their militia forces, Aytimur's position within the capital weakened. The aristocracy also disliked him due to his common origins. A member of the aristocracy, Khwaja Shams al-Din 'Ali, eventually rounded up several pro-dervish Sarbadar chiefs and they together confronted Aytimur. After voicing their complaints to him, the chiefs deposed Aytimur, who was executed shortly after in August or September 1346. Shams ad- Din 'Ali then installed Kulu Isfandiyar as Aytimur's successor. Notes References *Smith, Jr., John Masson. The History of the Sarbadar Dynasty 1336-1381 A.D. and Its Sources.

He graduated from the Đà Lạt National Military Academy. During the Vietnam War, he served in various infantry and armored units. His highest administrative position was Province Chief of Vĩnh Long. He, along with Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, executed President Ngô Đình Diệm and the President's confidant, his brother Ngô Đình Nhu after the latter were arrested at the end of an army coup. After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Nghia spent at least a dozen years in various re-education camps. In 1992, he was allowed to emigrate to the United States under the Humanitarian Orderly Departure Program.  Execution of Diem  The corpse of alt=Middle-aged black-haired man lies face half-down on the floor, covered on his face and dark suit and trousers with blood. His hands are behind his back. Nghia was part of a group of military personnel sent to arrest Diem and Nhu at the conclusion of the successful coup. After arresting the brothers and tying them with their hands behind their backs, Nghia and Major Nguyen Van Nhung sat with Diệm and Nhu inside the Armored Personnel Carrier, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base. They stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip where, by all accounts, the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by General Tran Van Don later determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing their bodies with a knife.Karnow, p. 326. Nghĩa gave his account of the assassinations to military headquarters: “As we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters, Diệm sat silently, but Nhu and the captain [Nhung] began to insult each other. I don’t know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion.” When the convoy reached a train crossing, Nghĩa said that Nhung “lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Diệm, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he looked back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Diệm nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied.”Jones, p. 429.  1964 coup  Nghia was then involved in a January 1964 coup, just three months later, against the military junta led by General Duong Van Minh that had toppled Diem. The plotters, led by General Nguyen Khanh, needed help from Nghĩa, one of the leading Đại Việt officers and temporary head of the Capital Armored Command. A friend and appointee of Minh, Nghia caused difficulties by failing to respond to General Nguyen Van Thieu's order that all armor be moved north out of Saigon to Thiệu's 5th Division headquarters at Biên Hòa, a satellite city on the northeastern edge of the capital. A CIA cable reported that Nghia was aware that the movements were part of a coup against Minh and told Thieu that he would not deploy out of the capital and declared his support for Minh. This caught the plotters off guard, and as Harkins left on his \\"fieldtrip\\" at the same time, historian George McTurnan Kahin conjectured that he had actually gone to lobby Nghia to support the coup or at least partially back it by agreeing to help depose Minh's confidants Đôn, Ton That Dinh, Le Van Kim and Mai Huu Xuan. However, it was then reported that Nghia had agreed to support Thieu, who had apparently then gained the control of both the armored and marine elements in Saigon.Kahin, p. 199. When the coup began, Nghia showed his mixed feelings about the junta through the selective use of his armored troops. They supported Khánh's move against Đính, Đôn, Kim and Xuân, but tried to protect Minh by using tanks to shield Minh's house from Duong Ngoc Lam's Civil Guard units, which were also used to arrest the four other leading junta members.Kahin, p. 200.

The appeal is cross-generational, and viewers include Muslims, Christians, Druze and Jews from Arab countries, the show was a huge success in the Arab World so MBC decided to renew it for a second season. The series' second season was even a bigger success, and the finale was watched by over a 50 million viewers around the Arab World. It was renewed for 3 more seasons. The show announced its cancellation due to a long run of seasons. The series made a comeback in Ramadan 2014, with season 6. It has been proposed that it be filmed in Dubai on film sets, but many Syrians protested against this as it removes the Bab Al Hara sensation. The sixth season premiered in Ramadan 2014 on MBC HD Channels and received mixed reviews. Overview Bab Al-Hara aired during Ramadan and forms part of the emerging modern tradition of the Ramadan soap opera. The Arab satellite channels broadcast special programming every night during Ramadan to try to capture audiences from among the families who have gathered together to eat and break the fast. Directed by Bassam al-Mulla and broadcast on MBC, the first installment of the series, comprising 31 episodes, aired during Ramadan in 2006 and enjoyed broad viewership and a positive reception. The second installment, entitled Bab al-Hara 2, was highly anticipated, receiving even wider acclaim in Ramadan of 2007. A third installment to be aired in Ramadan of 2008 was officially announced on al-Arabiya channel in October 2007, and will focus on the post-marriage lives of the children of Abu Issam, the local doctor and barber. Like many of the most recent popular Arabic series, Bab al- Hara is a Syrian production, financed by the Gulf-state satellite channels. It reflects a new trend representing the shift of Arabic media dominance away from the Egyptians to the Syrians. Two more Bab al-Hara seasons were aired in Ramadan 2009 and 2010, Bab al-Hara 4 and 5 were produced directly after each other just like Bab al-Hara 1 and 2. This was announced just after airing 10 episodes of Bab al-Hara 3 after realizing that Bab al-Hara 3 was able to keep its audience and not decline in ratings. It is obvious that MBC will be the channel to broadcast the series during the next 2 years, although this year they did give the rights to Libya Al-Shababiya (Libya Youth Channel) to broadcast Bab al-Hara 3 at the same time of airing it in MBC. Historical context Bab al-Hara takes place in the 1930s and 1940s, a time when much of Western Asia was colonized by Western powers. Syria was under French control and Palestine – where some of the neighborhood men go to fight at the end of the second installment of the series – was British-occupied. Bab al-Hara depicts the last moments of Syrian society as it existed in its centuries-old Ottoman era make-up, just prior to the transition into colonial and post- colonial modernity. The series' hearkening back to this era partially explains its massive popularity, an expression of the Arab world's nostalgia and yearning for a simple, more dignified time before the cataclysmic turmoil and cultural identity crisis ushered in by the colonial period. Background Bab al-Hara is based on an interpretation of life in the old city of Damascus. Every neighborhood, or hara, has its own Zaa’im, a chosen older man held in high regard. Ideally chosen Zaa’im based on his history in the neighborhood, the zaa’im depended on a number of men from the neighborhood gathered around him to assist him in his functions. These members along with the zaa’im constituted a small nucleus that ran the hara and decided on what was good for it. Wealthier members funded the zaa’im and had a say in its use, such as use for public renovation, given to charities for the poor or set aside for emergency uses. Members generally were of the mercantile class, having steady incomes from having shops or businesses, such as barber shops, bakeries, smiths, ghouta, groceries or other merchant activities.

The program is broadcast live in the eastern states (and on delay in other states) on the ABC Radio National network. It can also be listened to online. The program is hosted by award- winning journalist Fran Kelly. Background Radio National Breakfast programming combines news, analysis, commentary, interviews and special features broadcast live daily from 6.00 am to 9.00 am. The program is broadcast in two segments (6.00 to 7.00 and 7.30 to 8.30) before and after the current affairs program AM at 7.00. A weekend edition, called Saturday Extra, is hosted by journalist Geraldine Doogue and is broadcast from 7.30 am to 9.00 am AEST. Format The format of the program, while not always the same, is usually consistent. The program begins officially at 6.10 am following the hourly news broadcast. The news broadcasts are state-based and occur on the hour – and every hour – with the traditional \\"Majestic Fanfare\\" tune. The program has a familiar tune, during which the presenter indicates the main stories which will be covered during the program, including the interviews which are planned. About four items are presented each hour, with longer items earlier in the program. These will include a mix of reports from ABC correspondents, reports from the BBC and CNN, as well as interviews with a variety of people, including federal and state politicians, prominent commentators, persons of interest, celebrities and ordinary people who are in the middle of news stories. AM At 7.10 am, after the 7.00 news, Breakfast switches over to AM. AM is the ABC's flagship radio current affairs program, along with its sister programs The World Today and PM. AM is presented by Sabra Lane, an ABC journalist. The program runs from 7.10 am until 7.30 am, after which listeners are \\"returned\\" to Fran Kelly and the Breakfast program.

Following her arts degree at Adelaide University, majoring in literature and classics, she appeared first as a lead singer for the all-girl new wave band Toxic Shoc, before becoming the Activities Director for Adelaide's Flinders University. She moved to Melbourne to take up the post of Entertainment Director for La Trobe University. From 1984 Fran broadened her experience in arts management as the coordinator of the Women's Arts Festival for Victoria's 150th Anniversary celebrations. Following a stint on Melbourne's RRR Backchat program, featuring women's current affairs, issues and talkback, Fran applied for a current affairs position at the ABC. While she was knocked back initially, she got a foot in and found work at Triple J. Following this she worked for AM and PM before taking up a position for the ABC in the Canberra Press Gallery, which included reporting for Radio National Breakfast. In 2001 she was made the 7.30 Reports political editor. In 2003 she became the ABC's European correspondent. Since March 2005 she has been presenter of Radio National Breakfast. Contributors There are several regular contributors to the program. * Warwick Hadfield - sport reporter. * Matt Bevan - Newsreader and international reporter * Sheryle Bagwell – business reporter * Alison Carabine – Canberra reporter Recognition and acclaim Radio National Breakfast, while lower in ratings than most other state and local radio programs, has, as a national program, one of the highest listener numbers for any early morning program in Australia. In particular it is regarded as the program which federal Australian politicians listen to, particularly given its focus on national politics. Former Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, was known to be a ‘fan’ of the program and regularly appeared for interviews. In early 2007 Mr Howard cited an interview that Fran Kelly had conducted on Breakfast with Indigenous community leader Noel Pearson as being the motivation behind his ‘Federal Indigenous Intervention’ project, a controversial policy aimed at ending child sexual abuse in remote Indigenous communities.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Morning Light, an eight-gun ship, was built in 1853 by William Cramp & Sons in the Kensington section of Philadelphia; launched 15 August 1853; purchased by the Navy 2 September 1861 at New York City; and commissioned 21 November 1861 at New York Navy Yard, Acting Volunteer Lt. Henry T. Moore in command. After fitting out for combat, Morning Light sailed from New York to cruise the lower U.S. East Coast in search of Confederate privateers and blockade runners. Morning Light returned to New York, arriving 28 February 1862.  Assigned to the West Gulf Blockade  Assigned to Flag Officer David G. Farragut's West Gulf Blockading Squadron, Morning Light departed New York in March with provisions for ships in the Mississippi Sound area. On 15 April Farragut ordered her to remain with bark off Ship Island, Mississippi, as protection for the Army command of Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler which provided occupation troops for New Orleans, Louisiana, after Farragut's fleet captured the city 25 April. By 27 May Morning Light was off Pensacola, Florida, performing blockade duties with sloop . On 19 June sloop , temporary tender for Morning Light, intercepted sloop Ventura, loaded with foodstuff for New Orleans, off Grant's Pass, Mobile Bay, Alabama.  Destroying Confederate salt works at Cedar Lake  Returning to Ship Island, Mississippi, in August, Morning Light left in November for Velasco, Texas. On 27 and 28 November, she sent several boat expeditions ashore to destroy the Confederate salt works at Cedar Lake.  Morning Light is captured and burned  On 18 January 1863, Morning Light, Acting Master John Dillingham now in command, was ordered to blockade off Sabine Pass. Three days later two Confederate \\"cotton clad\\" steamers, Uncle Ben and Josiah Bell, with artillery and Texas infantry, attacked Morning Light and schooner in a successful effort to destroy the blockade at Galveston, Texas. Due to the calm weather, neither Union sailing ship could evade the Confederate fire, and both were forced to strike their colors. Morning Light, left a riddled wreck, was taken by the Confederates 21 January and burned two days later.

Until recently Iran had a voting age of 15; Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua have a voting age of 16; and Greece, Indonesia, East Timor, Sudan, and Seychelles have a voting age of 17.Worldwide Efforts to Lower the Voting Age, National Youth Rights Association. United States In the United States, suffrage originally could not be denied on account of age only to those 21 years of age or older; this age is mentioned in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified on July 1, 1971, lowered that age to 18. The primary impetus for this change was the fact that young men were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War before they were old enough to vote. There have been many proposals to lower the voting age even further. In 2004, California State Senator John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) proposed a youth suffrage constitutional amendment called Training Wheels for Citizenship that would give 14-year-olds a quarter vote, 16-year-olds a half vote, and 17-year-olds a full vote.Californians consider granting 14-year-olds the right to vote, Bobby Caina Calvan, Boston Globe, April 25, 2004. In 2013, Takoma Park, Maryland became the first U.S. city to allow 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote. On January 5, 2015, Hyattsville, Maryland joined Takoma Park in lowering the voting age to 16. Venezuela A proposal to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 was defeated in the 2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum. Arguments for and against youth suffrage =Arguments for= * People of all ages are required to pay income and sales taxes; therefore, denying them the right to vote is taxation without representation.Vote at 16. *Youths are legally permitted to have sex'We can have sex, so why can't we vote?', The Guardian, Feb. 28, 2006. or drive a car in some countries, which are more dangerous and difficult than voting. *Voter turnout among youth will improve if young people get in the habit of voting before they reach 18 and go to colleges far away from their state of residency, like it did in Germany when some states lowered their voting age for municipal elections.Top Ten Reasons to Lower the Voting Age, National Youth Rights Association. *Education for and about democracy would be better served if there were no voting age. *Government entitlements suppress fertility, which means the youth demographic is systematically suppressed, with no political power to offset the effect. *Governments derive their just authority from the consent of the governed. To be legitimate, those who govern and those who legislate must be elected by the people, not a special subset of the people, such as those over the age of X years. =Arguments against= *Some youth are believed by some to not to have sufficient understanding of the realities of life to participate in voting.Should 16-year-olds be allowed to vote?, BBC News (reader opinion), July 5, 2002. Impact Studies have found no differences in the quality of young voters' voting choices relative to older voters. A study of preregistration (registering individuals before they are eligible to vote) found that it was linked to higher youth turnout, and that politicians became more responsive to issues that the young have strong preferences on, such as higher education spending. One study found that allowing 16-year olds to vote led those voters to have \\"substantially higher levels of engagement with representative democracy (through voting) as well as other forms of political participation\\". Demeny voting Demeny voting is the idea that parents would cast votes on behalf of their children thereby ensuring that the interests of children were properly accounted for in the voting system. Most young people do not support themselves financially and are reliant upon parents for support, thus parental voting power should be proportionate to the number of dependents, especially where government benefits are concerned, to appropriately counterbalance the interests of the childless. Essentially, a case for \\"no taxation without representation.\\" However, as children and their parents often have differing political, social, and economic interests, it is doubtful demeny voting would result in any significant advances of youth interests in government.

Before attaining this position, Roger was a canon of Abernethy; it is possible that Roger was an Augustinian, because it is often thought that Abernethy did not become a collegiate church until some time after 1328, after the marriage of the Abernethy heiress to the Earl of Angus; this however is not certain, as the exact details of Abernethy's transition from being an Céli Dé abbey (until c. 1272–1273) to an Augustinian priory to a secular college are only vaguely understood.Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 215; Watt, Dictionary, p. 470; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 342. It was as a canon of Abernethy that, on 17 April 1325, he was issued papal provision to the diocese of Ross, vacant by the death of Thomas de Dundee.Dowden, Bishops, p. 214; Watt, Dictionary, p. 470; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. Roger was consecrated by Cardinal Guillaume Pierre Godin, Bishop of Sabina, at the papal curia sometime before 19 May.Dowden, Bishops, p. 214; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. Bishop Roger witnessed several royal charters during his episcopate. He witnessed a charter at Edinburgh on 4 March 1328; at Arbroath on 17 June 1341; and at Scone on 4 July 1342, and another (location not specified) on 4 July 1342.Dowden, Bishops, p. 214. Bishop Roger resigned the bishopric \\"for reasonable cause\\" at the papal curia on or sometime before 3 November 1350, when Alexander Stewart was provided in his place; Roger cannot be traced after that.Dowden, Bishops, p. 215; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 267. Donald Watt has argued that Roger is the same as Roger de Balnebrich, unfruitfully elected Bishop of Dunblane sometime between 1319 and 1322, and who Watt suggests had remained at the papal curia until provided to Ross.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 23, 470. Abernethy did lie in the diocese of Dunblane; Balnebrich held the position of rector of Forteviot when he was elected Bishop of Dunblane.Watt, Dictionary, p. 23. The suggestion is strengthened by Balnebrich's disappearance from the records after his failure to obtain Dunblane at the papal curia in March 1322. Unfortunately, as Professor Watt acknowledged, because the scarce evidence has not as yet given Roger, as Bishop of Ross, a surname, and because it has not yielded any direct statement to this effect, it cannot be proven that Roger (Bishop of Ross) and Roger de Balnebrich were one and the same person.

It is one of the 100 famous mountains in Japan. Routes Relief Map of Mount Tanigawa The mountain trail leading to the summit of Mount Tanigawa from four directions: north, south, east and west. The easiest and most popular route is the southern route via the aerial tramway, and many families reach the summit on holidays. Rock climbing routes are graded according to the Japanese Ice Climbing Rating from I-VI and there are numerous routes along the Eastern Ridges, with significant rock routes for summer climbing. Although the mountain is 1800 metres less than Mt. Fuji (in fact barely half its height), the relief is stark, with some routes starting as low as at 500 metres above sea level and topping out at or near the summit. Like many mountains in Japan there is no officially recorded first ascent. Many mountains enjoy a religious significance and have been hiked and summitted by Japanese religious ascetics for hundreds of years. Weather The mountain lies on the border of Gunma and Niigata Prefectures and sits precisely where the weather systems from the Asian continent and the Pacific meet in often furious displays of extreme weather. Cornices on the ridge can reach out over 20 metres and occur at lower levels of the mountain as well as along the summit ridge. When avalanche risk is high, the consequences can be particularly dangerous given the steep terrain and over 1000m of relief to gather force. Safety Although many trekking routes leading to the summit are relatively safe, there have been many deaths due to rock climbing, so it is sometimes called \\"mountain of death\\". As of December 2014, since its initial exploration and route-finding in the early 1930s, a total of 805 people have died on Tanigawa-dake.http://soka- yamanokai.com/study/study18.html日本医科大学雑誌第１２巻第９号別冊 昭和１６年発行東京緑山岳会編「谷川岳の岩場」昭和４９年発行 (Compare with the approximately 200 people who have died on Mt. Everest over a comparable period). In 1943 a climbing party disappeared on the mountain. They were not found until another climbing party stumbled upon their remains in 1973. In the 1960s there was a famous rescue attempt of Japanese climbers on the main face who had died of exposure. Their bodies were eventually brought down when the Japanese Self-Defense Forces cut the rope with gunfire in order to retrieve the bodies. (ja) Japan offers a high level of support with helicopter trained mountain rescue teams, though with high wind there is always the chance that they cannot be deployed. Along the upper ridges there are two safety huts. One is the emergency hut for 2-3 near Ichinokura-dake (一ノ倉岳), which may be hard to find on deep snow and therefore unusable. The much larger \\"Shoulder Hut\\" below the summit of Tanigawa-Dake is much more spacious, but is unheated and unmanned in winter. Sometimes called the mountain of death, the mountain is bedecked at all levels with commemorative plaques for those who have died on the mountain. Some of these groups have been rather large. Near the base of the mountain is a large sculpted piton, with an adjoining wall inscribed with the names of all those who have died on the mountain. Misc The closest train station is Doai (土合駅). Climbing Mount Tanigawa is one of the main storylines in the novel Climber's High which has also been made into an NHK documentary in 2005 and a movie in 2008.

Pre-Civil War sentiments During the beginning years of Nigeria's colonial independence, the Igbo people increasingly were perceived as a disproportionately-favored ethnic group with affluence and multi-regionalistic opportunity because the Igbo had been employed within the colonial Nigeria by the colonial authorities and in the public sector in regions throughout the country. This aroused the ire of others toward the Igbo. This was emphasized by the short-lived government of General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, whose military junta consisted mostly of Igbo and who abolished the federated regions; this led to his assassination in a counter-coup led primarily by Hausa/Fulani participant. It was followed by the massacre of thousands of Igbo in pogroms in the aforementioned region, which drove millions of Igbos to their homeland in Eastern Region; ethnic relations deteriorated rapidly, and a separate republic of Biafra was declared in 1967, leading to the Biafran War. Anti-Igbo Pogrom The 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom was a series of massacres directed at Igbo and other people of southern Nigerian origin living in northern Nigeria starting in May 1966 and reaching a peak after 29 September 1966. During this period 30,000-50,000 Igbo civilians were murdered throughout northern Nigeria by Hausa–Fulani soldiers and civilians who sought revenge for the 1966 Nigerian coup d'état, carried out by six Majors and three Captains, and resulted in the deaths of 11 Nigerian politicians and army officers.http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/features/80138 These events led to the secession of the eastern Nigerian region and the declaration of the Republic of Biafra, which ultimately led to the Nigeria-Biafra war. The 1966 massacres of southern Nigerians have been described as a holocaust by some authors and have variously been described as riots, pogroms or genocide.(hard covers £45.00, ; paperback £17.95, ) Portsmouth NH: Heinemann (hard covers US$67.95, ; paperback US$24.95, ). Nigerian Civil War The Republic of Biafra, was a secessionist state in eastern Nigeria that existed from 30 May 1967 to January 1970. It took its name from the Bight of Biafra, the Atlantic bay to its south. The inhabitants were mostly the Igbo people who led the secession due to economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria. Other ethnic groups that constituted the republic were the Efik, Ibibio, Annang, Ejagham, Eket, Ibeno and the Ijaw among others.

It has two essential components that do not exist in a written text dialog system: a speech recognizer and a text-to-speech module (written text dialog systems usually use other input systems provided by an OS). It can be further distinguished from command and control speech systems that can respond to requests but do not attempt to maintain continuity over time. Components * An automatic Speech recognizer (ASR) decodes speech into text. Domain-specific recognizers can be configured for language designed for a given application. A \\"cloud\\" recognizer will be suitable for domains that do not depend on very specific vocabularies. * Natural language understanding transforms a recognition into a concept structure that can drive system behavior. Some approaches will combine recognition and understanding processing but are thought to be less flexible since interpretation has to be coded into the grammar. * The dialog manager controls turn-by-turn behavior. A simple dialog system may ask the user questions then act on the response. Such directed dialog systems use a tree-like structure for control; frame- (or form-) based systems allow for some user initiative and accommodate different styles of interaction. More sophisticated dialog managers incorporate mechanisms for dealing with misunderstandings and clarification. * The domain reasoner, or more simply the back-end, makes use of a knowledge base to retrieve information and helps formulate system responses. In simple systems, this may be a database which is queried using information collected through the dialog. The domain reasoner, together with the dialog manager, maintain the context of interaction and allows the system to reflect some human conversational abilities (for example using anaphora). * Response generation is similar to text-based natural language generation, but takes into account the needs of spoken communication. This might include the use of simpler grammatical constructions, managing the amount of information in any one output utterance and introducing prosodic markers to help the human participant absorb information more easily. A complete system design will also introduce elements of lexical entrainment, to encourage the human user to favor certain ways of speaking, which in turn can improve recognition performance. * Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) realizes an intended utterance as speech. Depending on the application, TTS may be based on concatenation of pre-recorded material produced by voice professionals. In more complex applications TTS will use more flexible techniques that accommodate large vocabularies and that allow the developer control over the character (\\"personality\\") of the system. Varieties of systems Spoken dialog systems vary in their complexity. Directed dialog systems are very simple and require that the developer create a graph (typically a tree) that manages the task but may not correspond to the needs of the user. Information access systems, typically based on forms, allow users some flexibility (for example in the order in which retrieval constraints are specified, or in the use of optional constraints) but are limited in their capabilities. Problem-solving dialog systems may allow human users to engage in a number of different activities that may include information access, plan construction and possible execution of the latter. Some examples of systems include: * Information access: Weather, trains schedules, stock quotes, directory assistance. * Transactional: credit card and bank enquiries; ticket purchases. * Maintenance: Technical support including documentation access and diagnostic testing. * Tutoring: For education, such as physics or math, and language learning. * Entertainment and chatting  History  Pionieers in dialogue systems are companies like AT&T; (with its speech recognizer system in the Seventies) and CSELT laboratories, that led some European research projects during the Eighties (e.g. SUNDIAL) after the end of the DARPA project in the US. References The field of spoken dialog systems is quite large and includes research (featured at scientific conferences such as SIGdial and Interspeech) and a large industrial sector (with its own meetings such as SpeechTek and AVIOS).

In 1908, he was a founding member of the general workers committee of Mannheim-Ludwigshafen. From 1909 to 1920 he was a judge in commercial matters. In 1911, he was made chairman of the manufacturers society and was elected a member, 1920 chairman of the chamber of commerce. In 1922 he was, as a member of the German People's Party, elected a member of the citizens committee, on which he remained until 1930. For his efforts in support of the society for the promotion of the commercial university, he received the university's first honorary doctorate. In 1931, he was made chairman of a charitable relief society for the unemployed. On 27 March 1933, he was forced by the Nazi government to resign his seat in the chamber of commerce. In the following years he attempted, together with his two eldest sons who remained in Germany, to hold on to his company, but the rigorous measures of 1938 forced him to sell his house and his company and flee to England, later to the USA. His nephew Ludwig Lenel became a well-known composer. In exile, he was utterly unhappy and returned thus already in 1949 to Germany. On 18 October 1949, an honorary citizenship of the city of Mannheim was bestowed upon him, the following day he was made honorary chairman of the chamber of industry and commerce. A few days after his 81st anniversary, he died and was buried at the Jewish cemetery in Mannheim.

It opened through Glenpark on 29 August 1885; the station was 7.23 km from the junction with the main line, near the halfway point of the 15.2 km long branch. Passenger services were provided solely by mixed trains and due to low patronage, they were cancelled on 10 August 1930 and Glenpark station became freight only.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, rev. ed.

It seems that many of these events are limited to the phenomenon of war, merely because war in and of itself foments not only hostilities amongst men, but also severely transposes the character of a society in general. The poetry of Walt Whitman, for instance, reflects scenes of the American Civil War which occurred during his lifetime. In addition, figurative devices such as alliteration, assonance, metaphor, and simile are invariably used to layer these historical poems with expanding, enriching meanings.  Responsibility  In writing a historical poem, poets have a slightly different responsibility than do historians. A modern historian is expected to present factually correct narratives. A poet who writes historical poems can adhere to this ideal, but may also use artistic license to communicate ideas beyond mere fact, such as mythical or emotional truths. Contemporary poets such as Lavonne J. Adams are also concerned with keeping the voices of historical persons alive. This is especially crucial when writing persona poems or other intimate portrayals of people who can no longer speak for themselves.  Appeal  The interpretation of a historical poem is a matter of wide significance, particularly because it is linked to poetic intention. Cleanth Brooks writes in The Formalist Critics: > the author's intention as realized is the 'intention' that counts, not > necessarily what he was conscious of trying to do, or what he now remembers > he was then trying to do To add to this, the purpose of a historical poem serves various ulterior motives. One of these motives might include informing the audience at the time of present events, often to draw parallels and make a political statement. Other motives might be very personal in nature, if the poets feel a connection to the historical event(s) they are recording. When history seems relevant to the poets' lives, historical poetry can become a tool of emotional expression just like any other type of poetry.  Historical poems  These include the works of authors that embody particular events in history, notably gripping war scenes. A few examples of such poems include: * John Brown's Body by Stephen Vincent Benet * Civil War by Charles Dawson ShanlyCharles Dawson Shanly, Dictionary of Canadian Biography (retrieved February, 2014) * O Captain! My Captain! by Walt Whitman * The Charge of the Light Brigade by Alfred, Lord Tennyson * The Blue and the Gray by Francis Miles Finch * A Message by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward * Boston by Ralph Waldo Emerson * The Eve of Waterloo by Lord Byron * Shiloh: A Requiem (April, 1862) by Herman Melville * Vazetje Sigeta grada by Brne Karnarutić  References  Further reading * An Anthology of War Poetry, Royal Society of Arts, Journal 91:4649 (Oct. 1, 1943) * Austin, Alfred (1870), The Poetry of the Period * Brooks, Cleanth (1951), The Formalist Critics * Hand, Harry E., And War Be Done: Battle-Pieces and Other Civil War Poetry of Herman Melville * Lomas, Herbert, The Critic as Anti-Hero: War Poetry * Richards, I.A.

It is northwest of Palmerston and Glenpark, east of Stoneburn, on the banks of the Shag River. Economic activity around Inch Valley is agricultural.  Transport  Inch Valley is between Glenpark and Dunback on State Highway 85. For 104 years, a branch line railway passed through Inch Valley; for 68 of these years, it served as a railway junction. The Dunback Branch from the Main South Line through Inch Valley to Dunback opened on 29 August 1885, to open up the country and serve farming interests. On 31 March 1900 the short Makareo Branch from Inch Valley northeast to a limeworks in Makareao opened. Passengers in Inch Valley were served solely by mixed trains that ran between Palmerston and Dunback. Due to declining patronage these were cancelled on 10 August 1930 and replaced by goods-only trains.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 88. Inch Valley's railway station had a small shelter shed for passengers, a loading bank for freight and a loop for 15 wagons; 100 metres away was a ballast siding.Patrick Dunford, \\"Dunback & Makareao Branches\\" , accessed 12 October 2007. On 1 January 1968 the Dunback Branch was closed due to substantial financial losses. Local freight was no longer carried; trains ran through Inch Valley without stopping thrice weekly to serve the Makareao limeworks. On 1 June 1989 this line closed. The railway formation is visible around Inch Valley; at the old station site, a set of points and the loading bank are still in place. A 15-span trestle bridge that took the Makareao Branch over the Shag River was destroyed in the mid-1990s as a military training exercise.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 89.

After a season with City he joined Clapton Orient in July 1935, where he spent two seasons in the Third Division South.

After two seasons at The Dell, \\"his heading ability, coupled with some incisive tackling, reportedly attracted the attention of top London clubs, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea\\" but, unfortunately, the war interrupted his career and prevented a move to a bigger club. Affleck joined the Southampton police reservists and, during the war, turned out for the Southampton Police XI as well as making sporadic appearances for The Saints in wartime matches.

Roger received a university education, being styled Magister (\\"Master\\") by August 1313, though it is not known where he took his degree; the degree, however, was almost certainly done in canon law.Watt, Dictionary, p. 23. His name derives either from Ballinbreich in Fife or Balnabriech, in Brechin, Angus. Biography =Canon lawyer= Roger was an active canon lawyer in the diocese of St Andrews. He was holding the parish church at Blairgowrie in the diocese of St Andrews, a church in the gift of the Bishop of St Andrews, on 13 November 1313. It was on that date that he was granted a pension by Arbroath Abbey for the services he had provided them. He can be found on 3 August 1313, acting as a proctor for Henry Man, Abbot of Scone, before a hearing of two commissaries at St Andrews. He is found among a number of appointed arbiters settlings a dispute between Dunfermline Abbey and two residents of the Fithkil barony in Fife, though when that hearing met on 13 March 1320, Roger was not recorded as being present. =Elect of Dunblane= Sometime between 8 February 1319, the date at which Bishop Nicholas de Balmyle is last attested, and 5 March 1322, Roger was one of two different candidates elected by that cathedral chapter to succeed Nicholas as Bishop of Dunblane.Dowden, Bishops, p. 202; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 76. Litigation took place at the papal curia, in which Roger's rival Maurice, Abbot of Inchaffray, emerged victorious; Roger did not receive provision or consecration, and had resigned his claims before 5 March, when Maurice received papal provision. The sources say that by this point in time Roger was rector of Forteviot.Cockburn, Medieval Bishops, pp. 90-1; Dowden, Bishops, p. 202; Watt, Dictionary, p. 23; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 76. = Roger, Bishop of Ross= Roger may have disappeared from the records after that, though this is now doubtful. Professor Donald Watt has argued that Roger de Balnebrich is the same as Roger, Bishop of Ross from 1325 until 1350, and who Watt suggests had remained at the papal curia for three years until provided to Ross.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 23, 470. This Roger was said to have been a canon of Abernethy, which did lie in the diocese of Dunblane. Unfortunately, as Professor Watt acknowledged, because the scarce evidence has not as yet given Roger, as Bishop of Ross, a surname, and because it has not yielded any direct statement on the matter, it cannot be proven that Roger de Balnebrich and Roger (Bishop of Ross) were one and the same person.

Ancestry The grandfather on the mother's side of Ludwig Lenel was a Prussian democrat Friedrich Kapp (1824–1884), who emigrated to the United States, but returned later to become a national-liberal deputy to the German Reichstag and a friend of Bismarck. His youngest son Wolfgang, a great-uncle of Lenel was a leader of the 1920 coup d'état. Since 1918, the Lenels have lived in various places, one among them being Heidelberg. Lenel's father was a lecturer for Italian medieval history, and his uncle was the famous industrialist Richard Lenel. He was made an honorary professor without remuneration of the university in 1932, but was forced out of it a year later because he was Jewish. In August 1933, he lost his license to teach. He died in 1937 in Heidelberg. Lenel, who was half-Jewish, was the last of his family to leave Germany in 1939 to relatives in the US. Life of Ludwig Lenel Born on May 20, 1914 in Strasburg, Germany (now France), Ludwig Lenel was a son of the late Walter and Luise (Borckenhagen) Lenel. During his youth, he met and was strongly influenced by Albert Schweitzer, who frequently stayed with the Lenel family while visiting Heidelberg, Germany.\\"Ludwig Lenel\\" (obituary). Allentown, Pennsylvania: Morning Call, April 26, 2002. He then later studied organ with Schweitzer, and assisted him on tours of Germany and Switzerland in 1932 and 1936, respectively. In between those tours, Lenel's concerto for two violins and string orchestra was premiered at the Collegium Musicum of Heidelberg in 1933, and he then earned his diploma in 1935 from the Hochschule fuer Musik in Cologne, Germany. In 1938, he was also awarded a diploma from Switzerland's Basel Conservatory of Music.\\"Ludwig Lenel\\" (obituary). Morning Call. After emigrating to the United States, Lenel worked as an organist and continued his studies in music composition at Oberlin College (Ohio/USA), where he was awarded his master of music degree in 1940. A resident of Illinois, Pennsylvania and member of the faculties at Monticello College and Elmhurst College, Westminster College in Pennsylvania, and the New School for Social Research in New York City, he eventually joined the faculty of Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he taught for 27 years as a professor of music. During his tenure, he created the music department's curriculum, and also established the college's program which enabled students to major in music. Conductor of the College Choir, he initiated a concert series and took the group on tour, and also founded the Department of Opera.\\"Ludwig Lenel\\" (obituary). Morning Call. Retired from Muhlenberg College in 1979, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from that institution in 1989.\\"Ludwig Lenel\\" (obituary). Morning Call. On November 9, 1998, Lenel returned to Heidelberg to attend the performance of his main oeuvre, Death and Atonement, for narrator, violin, oboe, brass, piano and drums, in memory of the Holocaust. The 20-minute-long concerto, written between 1976 and 1992, is based on Paul Celan's poem Todesfuge and texts by Nelly Sachs. Composer Wolfgang Fortner mentions Lenel, besides René Frank, Laurence Feininger, and others, as witnesses and examples of his teaching Jewish students before and during World War II in the attachment of his \\"Story of Life\\" in his de- Nazifiying file (Generallandesarchiv Karlsruhe). Death and funeral Lenel died on April 22, 2002 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Funeral services were held on May 24, 2002 in the Egner Memorial Chapel at Muhlenberg College. His obituary noted that he was the \\"former husband of Jane Lenel,\\" and that he was survived by a son, two daughters, a brother and a sister, and three grandchildren.\\"Ludwig Lenel\\" (obituary).

It is 8 km north-west of Kaeo and 35 km north-west of Kerikeri. The harbour is almost landlocked and is popular both as a fishing spot in its own right and as a base for deep-sea fishing. Whangaroa is part of the Whakarara statistical area, which covers the area east of Whangaroa Harbour to Matauri Bay For demographics of this area, see Matauri Bay. History The harbour was the scene of one of the most notorious incidents in early New Zealand history, the Boyd massacre. In December 1809 almost all the crew and 70 passengers were killed as utu (revenge) for the mistreatment of Te Ara, the son of a Ngāti Uru chief, who had been in the crew of the ship. Several days later the ship was burnt out after gunpowder was accidentally ignited. Relics of the Boyd are now in a local museum. On 16 July 1824 on a voyage to Sydney from Tahiti, the crew and passengers of the colonial schooner Endeavour (Capt John Dibbs) stopped in Whangaroa Harbour. An altercation with the local Māori Ngāti Pou hapū (subtribe) of the Ngā Puhi iwi resulted in an incident where Maori warriors took control of the Endeavour and menaced the crew. The situation was defused by the timely arrival of the Ngāti Uru chief Te Ara, of Boyd fame. The incident was initially described by Rev. Tyerman as a mostly a problem of cultural differences, but in later years the story became a perilous cannibal adventure that defined the Māori (to European readers) as barbarian savages. In February 1827, the famous Ngā Puhi chief Hongi Hika was engaged in warfare against the tribes of Whangaroa. Acting contrary to the orders of Hongi Hika, some of his warriors plundered and burnt Wesleydale, the Wesleyan mission that had been established in June 1823 at Kaeo,Journal of William Williams, March 1st 1827 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2011) nine kilometres from Whangaroa.

They were conveyed by ship to Sydney, NSW.The Times, London, article CS118772953 dated 25 June 1827; retrieved 4 May 2004. During a skirmish Hongi Hika was shot in the chest by one of his warriors.

Harriet Ottenheimer (2006), a writer in Linguistic Anthropology, defines a semantic domain as a “specific area of cultural emphasis”. In lexicography a semantic domain or semantic field is defined as \\"an area of meaning and the words used to talk about it ... For instance English has a domain ‘Rain’, which includes words such as rain, drizzle, downpour, raindrop, puddle.\\". Semantic domains are the foundational concept for initial stages of vernacular dictionary building projects. This uses techniques such as SIL International's Dictionary Development Process (DDP), RapidWords, or software such as WeSay or FLEx. These techniques rely on extensive lists of semantic domains that are relevant to vernacular languages. In the social sciences, the concept of semantic domains stemmed from the ideas of cognitive anthropology. The quest was originally to see how the words that groups of humans use to describe certain things are relative to the underlying perceptions and meanings that those groups share (Ottenheimer, 2006, p. 18). Ethnosemantics became the field that concentrated around the study of these semantic domains, and more specifically the study of how categorization and context of words and groups of words reflected the ways that different cultures categorize words into speech and assign meaning to their language. Examples Many sports have specific semantic domains that entail terminology that is specific to that particular sport. In order to understand the meanings of these terms one would need to understand the context and domain of that sport. For instance, in basketball there are many words that are specific to the sport. Free throw, court, half court, three pointer, and point guard are all terms that are specific to the sport of basketball. These words make very little sense when used outside of the semantic domain of basketball. Another example of a semantic domain would be a coffee shop. The words latte, cappucino, or Starbucks probably would not be understood unless one could associate this language with the semantic domain of a coffee shop.

The main focuses of the magazine are politics, economy, social issues and culture. History CartaCapital was created as a monthly magazine in 1994 by Mino Carta, an Italo-Brazilian journalist. In 1968, Carta founded Brazil's leading newsmagazine Veja alongside Victor Civita. Eight years later, he founded IstoÉ, another popular newsmagazine. Unsatisfied with the result of the magazines he helped to create, Carta founded CartaCapital as an alternative to these. CartaCapital is noted for its small crew; it only has eleven journalists. The magazine was published on a monthly until 1996 when its frequency was switched to biweekly. Its frequency was changed to weekly in 2002. The magazine is known for supporting causes in a biased way, such as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's both candidatures, the legalization of abortion in all cases, the maintenance of the current age of criminal responsibility and the extradition of Cesare Battisti to Italy, among other polemic issues. Carta argues that the magazine does it to avoid hiding in a curtain of impartiality and not being honest to its readers. CartaCapital is a declared left-wing publication but has in its staff Antonio Delfim Netto, Minister of Economy during the right-wing military dictatorship. Besides his participation in a right-wing government, Antonio Delfim Netto is a Keynesian.

The Taltheilei Shale Tradition is named after the \\"Taltheilei Narrows\\" (place of open water) of Great Slave Lake. Taltheilei people were Proto-Athapaskans. Ethnography The Taltheilei were Boreal Forest people who moved into the lands previously inhabited by Arctic groups when the climate changed around 750 BC. Their territory included the central District of Mackenzie and the interior area of the District of Keewatin during the period of 700 BC until early trading posts were established. Sites attributable to the Taltheilei Shale Tradition have been found in several places. Their Little Duck Lake site later became the site of a Hudson Bay trading post called \\"Caribou Post\\" due to its proximity to the migration path of the caribou; these Taltheilei are ancestors of the Sayisi Dene, now a Chipewyan band. Other Taltheilei lived at Shethanei Lake (traveled later by Samuel Hearne in the early days of the Hudson's Bay Company), Caribou Lake (on the Manigatogan River system) and Egenolf Lake, all in northern Manitoba. Taltheilei economy was based on barren-ground caribou. For hunting, Taltheilei made very distinctive spear and arrow points, some of which changed over time. Their tools included awls, adze bits, knives, scrapers, stone drills, whetstones. The Taltheilei people are considered proto-Athapaskan, and are ancestors to two Dene people, the Yellowknives and the Chipewyan and possibly the Dene Dogribs. Taltheilei are distinct, linguistically and culturally, from the Cree, Ojibwe and other Algonkian people of the Boreal Forest. Early, Middle, Late periods Archaeologist divide Taltheilei Shale Tradition into periods based on their tools. * Their Early Period, 750 BC. - AD 200, is characterized by the presence of stemmed projectile points. * The Middle Period, AD 200 - 700, is characterized by fewer stemmed projectile points and the appearance of lanceolate specimens. * The Late Period, AD 700 - 1700, is characterized by the introduction of side-notched and corner-notched points.

Jamieson was born in the central Queensland town of Monto in 1934 and died there in 1992. Career Jamieson liked to be thought of as a Romantic. He objected to the labels of art commentators. He painted figurative art works, landscape art works, and portraits striking for their passionate intensity of both subject and colour. He wrestled with the tough reality of survival in the bush and lived the landscape that he painted. He lived and worked on the land with his family raising cattle on a bush block near Monto. He embarked on extensive expeditions throughout Australia capturing the subtle beauty and magnificence of the country in gouaches he called his 'sonnets'. His 72-foot 360 degree mural 'Jay Creek', an oil on canvas, painted on location in Central Australia, his largest and a most engrossing work was painted in four days in searing heat. Jamieson regarded himself as a self-taught artist, however he attended Brisbane Central Technical College (with Melville Haysom), 1956–57. While in Brisbane he aspired to political cartooning, worked as a quick sketch artist outside a nightclub and held his first exhibition at a Brisbane pub Jamieson and his wife Maureen moved from Monto to Melbourne and his career flourished. His work was taken up by John Reed of Heide Museum of Modern Art where he exhibited. He developed strong friendships with fellow artists: George Johnson, Fred Williams, John Perceval, Edwin Tanner to name a few. These friendships sustained and affirmed his contribution to Australian art as later in his career, fellow artists such as Cliff Pugh and Arthur Boyd supported his work. He chose to return to the bush and relative obscurity returning regularly to exhibit in Melbourne. Throughout his career Jamieson had many supporters of his work including Kym Bonython and Rudy Komon. He had a long association with Rockhampton exhibiting there and in Brisbane regularly throughout his career.

It is a resident breeding bird in The Gambia, Nigeria and Cameroon. It occurs in isolated localities, especially on river flood plains. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the variable indigobird, Vidua funerea. It is a brood parasite which lays its eggs in the nest of the African quailfinch, Ortygospiza atricollis, a slightly unusual host since it is only a distant relative to the firefinches parasitised by most indigobirds. It does not destroy the host's egg, but its own eggs are added to those already present. The adult male quailfinch indigobird has greenish-black plumage, and the female resembles a female house sparrow, with streaked brown upperparts, buff underparts and a whitish supercilium. Many of the indigobirds are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. A helpful pointer is the association with the host species, the quailfinch. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain. References R.B. Payne & L.L.

It juxtaposes a romantic drama with the background of the horrors of World War I, and it is sometimes described as a pacifist or anti-war film.e.g. \\"poignant mélodrame pacifiste\\", in Dictionnaire du cinéma populaire français; [edited by] Christian-Marc Bosséno & Yannick Dehée. (Paris: Nouveau Monde Éditions, 2004) p. 382; \\"incomparable anti-war film\\", in Susan Sontag, Regarding the Pain of Others. (London: Penguin, 2004) p. 14. Work on the film began in 1918, and some scenes were filmed on real battlefields. The film's powerful depiction of wartime suffering, and particularly its climactic sequence of the \\"return of the dead\\", made it an international success, and confirmed Gance as one of the most important directors in Europe.Kevin Brownlow. Essay in booklet accompanying DVD edition of J'accuse by Flicker Alley, 2008. p. 11. Plot In a Provençal village in the south of France, the villagers welcome the declaration of war with Germany in 1914 and flock to enlist. Among them is François Laurin, a man of jealous and violent temperament, who is married to Édith, the daughter of an upright veteran soldier Maria Lazare. François suspects, correctly, that Édith is conducting an affair with the poet Jean Diaz who lives in the village with his mother, and he sends Édith to stay with his parents in Lorraine – where she is subsequently captured and raped by German soldiers. François and Jean find themselves serving in the same battalion at the front, where the initial tensions between them give way to a close friendship that acknowledges that they both love Édith. In 1918, Jean is discharged through ill-health and returns to the village, to find his mother dying. Édith reappears from captivity, now with a young half-German daughter Angèle. Her father, Maria Lazare, immediately leaves to avenge the shame to the family name. When François comes home on leave, Jean and Édith fear his reaction to the illegitimate child and try to conceal her from him, which merely revives his jealous suspicions of Jean, and the two men fight. When the truth is revealed, François and Jean agree to seek their vengeance in battle and both return to the front. In a great battle, in which a mythical figure of Le Gaulois leads on the French forces, François is wounded and dies in the field hospital. Jean, meanwhile, is so shell-shocked that he becomes insane. He returns to the village and gathers the inhabitants together to tell them of his vision on the battlefield: from the graves of the dead, soldiers arise and gather in a great cohort that marches through the land, back to their homes. Jean challenges the villagers to say whether they have been worthy of the men's sacrifices, and they watch in horror as their dead family and friends appear on the threshold. The soldiers return to their rest, and Jean goes back to his mother's house. There he finds a book of his own poems which he tears up in disgust, until one of them, his Ode to the Sun, drives him to denounce the sun for its complicity in the crimes of war. As the sunlight fades from the room, Jean dies.

He had already formulated the idea for J'accuse, influenced by the constant news of the deaths of friends at the front, and also by the recently published book Le Feu by Henri Barbusse, and he succeeded in persuading Charles Pathé to finance the film.Kevin Brownlow. The Parade's Gone By.... (London: Columbus Books, 1989; first publ. 1968) p. 531. Filming took place between August 1918 and March 1919.Booklet accompanying DVD edition of J'accuse by Flicker Alley, 2008. p. 17. In order to film the battle scenes, Gance asked to return to the front and was re-enlisted into the Section Cinématographique, with the result that he found himself in September 1918 filming in the battle of Saint-Mihiel alongside the United States Army. His authentic footage was edited into the final section of the film.Kevin Brownlow. The Parade's Gone By.... (London: Columbus Books, 1989; first publ. 1968) p. 532. The sequence of the 'return of the dead' at the end of the film was shot in the south of France, using 2000 soldiers who had come back on leave. Gance recalled: \\"The conditions in which we filmed were profoundly moving... These men had come straight from the Front – from Verdun – and they were due back eight days later. They played the dead knowing that in all probability they'd be dead themselves before long. Within a few weeks of their return, eighty per cent had been killed.\\"Kevin Brownlow. The Parade's Gone By.... (London: Columbus Books, 1989; first publ. 1968) p. 533. For the film's opening title, a large group of soldiers, filmed from above, is formed up to shape the letters J...A...C...C...U...S...E. In the middle of preparing the shot, a general asked Gance what was happening. Gance stalled until the shot was complete, and then explained to the startled general that he was \\"accusing the war... accusing men... accusing universal stupidity\\". In the final scenes of the film, Gance's accusations, through the mouth of Jean Diaz, seem to be levelled against those who have not cared enough – the civilians who enjoyed another life, or those who profited from the war, or who simply forgot what it meant. The soldiers risen from the dead are said to be content to return to their rest once reassured by the living that their sacrifice has not been in vain. Diaz's final accusation is made against the sun for being a mute witness to so much horror. Asked whether he regarded J'accuse as a pacifist film, Gance replied: \\"I'm not interested in politics... But I am against war, because war is futile. Ten or twenty years afterward, one reflects that millions have died and all for nothing. One has found friends among one's old enemies, and enemies among one's friends.\\" Not all critics however have been convinced of the focus of Gance's argument: \\"Seemingly critical of a patriotism that blindly ignores the death it causes, J'accuse ends up celebrating the dead's sacrifice as a form of patriotism\\".Richard Abel. French Cinema: the First Wave 1915–1929. (Princeton University Press, 1984) p. 302. Others have noted that J'accuse mixes pacifism with nationalism, pointing to Gance's inspirations which included not only Henri Barbusse but also Emile Zola and Richard Grelling. While German imperialism was a target of Gance's film, so were ordinary French citizens: \\"His fiery tirade is directed at those within France who have betrayed the soldiers and their fight for civilization: a terrifying accusation against not only the onscreen audience, but also against Gance's offscreen audience in 1919.\\" The technical quality of the film was impressive, especially the cinematography of Léonce-Henri Burel with its subtle use of lighting effects and a mobile camera.\\"...as inventive and as impressive as anything produced up to that time\\": Kevin Brownlow. The Parade's Gone By.... (London: Columbus Books, 1989; first publ. 1968) p. 534. For the battle scenes in the last section of the film Gance also introduced some of the techniques of rapid editing which he would develop much further in his later films La Roue and Napoléon. Gance's assistant director was the writer Blaise Cendrars, who had lost an arm while fighting in 1915, and who also appeared as one of the dead soldiers rising from the battlefield. The cost of making the film was 525,000FF, a considerable sum for the time. By 1923 it was reported to have earned 3,500,000FF.Georges Sadoul. Dictionnaire des films. (Paris: Seuil, 1983) p. 153. Reception When J'accuse was first shown in France in April 1919, it was a great success with the public, whose mood in the aftermath of the war it seemed to capture.Richard Abel. French Cinema: the First Wave 1915–1929. (Princeton University Press, 1984) p. 296. Its acclaim continued when it was shown in London in May 1920, at the Philharmonic Hall with a 40-piece orchestra and a professional choir (and without being shown to the British Board of Film Censors).Kevin Brownlow. Essay in booklet accompanying DVD edition of J'accuse by Flicker Alley, 2008. p. 10. The reviewer in The Times, while finding it \\"a trifle uneven\\", noted that familiar incidents of war stories were \\"set forth with more conviction, and at the same time with more bitterness, than they have ever been before\\". He was also deeply impressed by the vision of the awakening of the dead from the battlefield, and paid it the final tribute that \\"a film has caused an audience to think\\".The Times (London), Tuesday 25 May 1920, p. 8, col. B. Gance received a telegram from Pathé's London agent saying, \\"Your name in England is, at present, more famous than Griffith's\\". Pathé initially had no success in selling the film for distribution in the United States, where its references to pacifism were unfavourably regarded, and in 1921 Gance went to America hoping to launch it himself. He arranged a gala screening in New York to an audience which included D. W. Griffith and Lillian Gish. Griffith was greatly moved by the film and arranged for its distribution through United Artists. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars, calling the film \\"[a] vividly filmed classic\\". On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. Versions Gance frequently revised and re-edited his films, and several different versions of J'accuse came into existence. It was originally said to be in four episodes (film length 5250 metres), but was then reduced to three episodes (4350 metres).Norman King. Abel Gance. (London: British Film Institute, 1984) pp. 237–38. It was re-edited into a shorter version entitled I Accuse, released in 1921 and intended for American audiences, with a less universal anti-war slant, a more anti-German stance, and a happy ending. The surviving prints show many other variations. A new restoration of the film was produced by Lobster Films Studios, Paris, working in collaboration with Nederlands Filmmuseum and Flicker Alley. They culled materials from the Lobster Collection, the Czech Film Archive in Prague, the Cinémathèque Française, and the Nederlands Filmmuseum to make the best possible and most complete edition of the original film (3525 metres). This was issued on DVD in 2008. In 1938, Gance made another version of J'accuse, this time with sound and looking ahead to the imminent outbreak of World War II.

It is the ability to understand and/or interpret the multi-layered meanings of stories, words, and other folk sayings within any given community of the African diaspora. These meanings supersede those of \\"...Western or westernized signification\\" (42), meaning that they go beyond literal or typical literary interpretation into an area of folk understanding that could only be recognized by the eye skilled in such an understanding. Readers rely solely upon a knowledge and lived experience of social, historical, and cultural climates of the various cultures of the African diaspora as a foundation for interpretation. Theoretical foundations of diaspora literacy Diaspora literacy is based upon several different theoretical concepts. The first concept is that of African diaspora, which is \\"...the phenomenon and history...\\" of the displacement of African-descended peoples in the New World colonies of the Atlantic. The second concept is a trio of socio- political movements (The New Negro/Harlem Renaissance; Indigenismo; and Negritude) of the 1920s and 1930s (1991, 40). In these movements, the displaced and colonized peoples of the Afro-Atlantic world came to embrace an awareness and appreciation of the political, cultural, and creative self as something unique in itself and thus not required to conform to European aesthetics. The third and final concept is that of \\"signifyin(g)\\". Signifying is a literary concept developed by scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his work The Signifying Monkey (Gates, 1988). Essentially the author takes a well-known story or idea and revises it, embellishing it with the language and imbuing it with cultural meanings and signs related to his or her particular Afro- descended culture or within that specific cultures generational cultures. If one were to trace and compare the line of repetitions and reversals, one would then see the creation of a Diasporic literary canon, imbued with a Diasporic language that only a literacy of the intricacies of the cultures could interpret. History of the term diaspora literacy At the late 1980s the African Literature Association Conference by Clark. She presented it in a paper delivered on Maryse Condé's Heremakhonon (1991, 58–59). It was later revised in \\"Developing Diaspora Literacy: Allusion in Maryse Condé's Hérémakhonon\\" (Davies: 1989, 315–331) in 1989, and in \\"Developing Diaspora Literacy and Marasa Consciousness\\" in 1991. Since then, several literature and education scholars have adopted the concept. The most recent adaptation appeared in Joyce E. King’s 2006 \\"'If Justice is Our Objective': Diaspora Literacy, Heritage Knowledge, and the Praxis of Critical Studyin' for Human Freedom\\" (Ball: 2006, 337–360).

Mockbusters are often made with a low budget and quick production to maximize profit. Unlike films that are produced to capitalize on the popularity of a recent release by adopting similar genre or storytelling elements, mockbusters are generally produced concurrently with upcoming films, and released direct-to-video at the same time the real film reaches cinemas or video outlets. A mockbuster may be similar enough in title, packaging, etc. in hopes that consumers confuse it with the actual film it mimics, but their producers maintain that they are simply offering additional products for consumers who want to watch additional films in the same subgenres. \\"Mockbuster\\" is a portmanteau of the words \\"mock\\" and \\"blockbuster.\\" History Mockbusters have a long history in Hollywood and elsewhere. For example, the 1959 Vanwick film The Monster of Piedras Blancas was a clear derivative of Creature from the Black Lagoon, complete with a creature suit by the same designer, Jack Kevan. Attack of the 50 Foot Woman spawned Village of the Giants; The Land That Time Forgot spawned Legend of Dinosaurs & Monster Birds. Such films tend to fit the classic B movie model, produced on a small budget and derivative of the target film and other similar projects. The reduced costs made available by using modern video and computer graphics equipment, and the tie-in to the mainstream film's advertising, has allowed the mockbuster to find a profitable niche in the home video market. Blockbuster, at one time one of the largest DVD and video game rental chains, gave implied support to the concept by buying 100,000 copies of The Asylum's version of War of the Worlds in time to coincide with the theatrical opening week of Steven Spielberg's film based on the same novel starring Tom Cruise. Most mockbusters capitalize on the popularity of theatrically released movies, but some are derivative of a TV series or other popular form of media. The 1979 film Angels Revenge bore many superficial similarities to the popular TV series Charlie's Angels; its promotional materials even resembled Charlie's Angels' graphic style. In reverse, Glen A. Larson was accused of producing mockbusters at the height of his career, with his television series plagiarizing popular films of the time (Battlestar Galactica, for example, capitalized on the popularity of Star Wars, while Alias Smith and Jones was a take on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). GoodTimes Entertainment was notorious for distributing animated \\"mockbuster\\" counterparts to popular Disney films in the 1990s (such as those made by Golden Films);The Ultimate Guide to Animated Mockbusters–Cartoon Brew because Disney was creating its films based on public domain folk tales and historical stories, GoodTimes' actions were completely legal and survived Disney's legal challenge against it. Similarly, Vídeo Brinquedo is a Brazilian CGI animation studio that in 2006 began to produce low-budget direct-to-video films that are for the most part knockoffs of movies from Pixar, Disney, and DreamWorks. Their films that are considered to be derivative include Little & Big Monsters (DreamWorks' Monsters vs. Aliens), The Little Cars series of cartoons (Pixar's Cars series), Ratatoing (Pixar's Ratatouille), Tiny Robots (Pixar's WALL-E), What's Up?: Balloon to the Rescue! (Pixar's Up), and The Frog Prince (Disney's The Princess and the Frog).Animated Knock-offs #1: The Real 'Mockbusters'!Cartoon Research In every case Vídeo Brinquedo's knockoff has been released suspiciously close to the release date of the more professional, higher- budgeted film that inspired it.The History of the Mockbuster by Filmmaker IQ on YouTube Dingo Pictures, a German animation company based in Friedrichsdorf, also created traditionally-animated films based on fairy tales and concepts similar to those used by Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks. These cartoons are characterized by low-budget animation, small voice casts, and character designs that are very similar to equivalent characters in more high-profile movies.The Insanely Strange Lion King Knockoff and Other ‘Mockbusters’ You Must SeeVillage Voice Cartoons have also been dubbed into Scandinavian languages notably Swedish, and also into Romance languages, notably Italian, and all of them have been released direct-to-video in Germany in their original languages. European game publishers Phoenix Games and Midas Games released some of them in the early 2000s on home video consoles PlayStation and PlayStation 2. These releases were developed by The Monkey Code and included the film, as well as a small collection of mini games. Phoenix Games went out of business in 2009. The 2011 film Aliens vs Avatars was named to market it as a crossover to Alien and Avatar, even though the latter two films have no connection outside of director James Cameron.Does Anyone Know The Way To MOCKBUSTER?Warped Factor The film follows the intergalactic battle between a quarrelsome alien race and shape-shifting extraterrestrials, while six college friends find themselves in the middle of the interstellar war. A 1993 science fiction horror film titled Carnosaur, produced by Roger Corman and starring Diane Ladd as a mad scientist who plans to recreate dinosaurs and destroy humanity, is loosely based on the 1984 novel of the same name by John Brosnan, but the two have little in common. It was released by New Horizon Picture Corp two weeks before the blockbuster Jurassic Park. Carnosaur may be considered a mockbuster.Brian Raftery. \\"Now Playing: Cheap-and-Schlocky Blockbuster Ripoffs\\", Wired, 21 December 2009. Retrieved 25 June 2011. (Diane Ladd's daughter Laura Dern starred in Jurassic Park) In some cases, the knockoff film may bear little or no resemblance to the original. In 2012, Super K – The Movie, an Indian fantasy/science-fiction animated film about an artificially created boy named \\"Super Kloud\\" with superpowers, was released direct-to-video in the United States as Kiara the Brave. Its title and cover art focused on an incidental female character with red hair (i.e. Merida), in an obvious attempt to evoke the redheaded female protagonist of Brave, a Disney/Pixar movie set in medieval Scotland. In other cases, the knockoff film simply renames an already existing film into a name that is similar to a popular film.Animated Konck-Offs #2: Not Quite 'Mockbusters'!Cartoon Research For example, The Legend of Sarila was renamed Frozen Land to cash in on Disney's 2013 film, Frozen.Top 10 Worst Animated Movies Rip-Offs-WatchMojo on YouTube In another case, a collection of animated shorts from the 90s animated series, Britannica's Tales Around the World, was rereleased under Tangled Up by Brightspark to cash in on Disney's 2010 film, Tangled. Brightspark also rereleased the film The Adventures of Scamper the Penguin under Tappy Feet: The Adventures of Scamper to cash in on Happy Feet. Asylum CEO David Michael Latt responds to criticisms about loose plot lines by stating that \\"We don't have spies at the studios. We have a general sense of what the film is and we make our movie completely original, just based on that concept.\\" Mockbusters are low budget, and their revenue is based entirely on the sales of their DVDs. Low budgets also mean that directors need to think of creative yet cheap ways to achieve the endings that they desire. For example, Snakes on a Train capitalized on the Internet hype surrounding Snakes on a Plane. Consumers wanted what they saw. Latt said, \\"With only four days left of shooting my partner called and said everyone is really excited about Snakes on a Train, but they’re more excited about the poster, which showed a snake swallowing a train. It was meant to be, you know, metaphorical. But the buyers wanted it, so I was given the mandate that the ending had to have the snake eat the train.\\" At the same time another representative of Asylum, David Rimawi, says that while a handful of their movies do have \\"artistic elements\\", that's just not something they're concerned with. The Asylum does not claim to be an \\"artsy\\" production house. Soundalike titling Mockbusters often use a title with a similar-sounding name to the mainstream feature it intends to piggy- back upon. For instance, the 2006 mockbuster Snakes on a Train traded on the publicity surrounding the theatrically released Snakes on a Plane. Besides the aforementioned film, The Asylum has also released The Land That Time Forgot, Transmorphers, AVH: Alien vs. Hunter, The Da Vinci Treasure, Battle of Los Angeles, Atlantic Rim and Paranormal Entity. Foreign knockoffs and illegitimate sequels Mockbusters and ripoffs can be filmed and released outside of the original films’ countries. Low-budget studios in foreign countries may produce illegitimate sequels to pre-existing higher budgeted films series that began in other countries. These sequels are unofficial, and often even unknown to the creators and producers of the original films. These unofficial sequels are rarely, or never, released in the original country, usually due to licensing issues. In other cases, a film released in other countries is renamed as a sequel to another film in contrast to the original title. Two Italian directors directed unofficial sequels to George A. Romero's 1978 Dawn of the Dead: Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 sold itself as the sequel to that film (which was called Zombi in Italy) and even used a line originally written for Dawn of the Dead. In a similar, more infamous Italian example, the 1990 goblin-themed Troll 2 was hastily marketed as a sequel to Troll. The Philippine film industry is also known for its unauthorised adaptations of popular Western films. The popularity of the Batman films, most especially the 1966 TV series, has led to numerous unauthorised remakes and pastiches, such as James Batman starring comedian Dolphy, Batman Fights Dracula, and Alyas Batman en Robin. Dolphy also played leading roles in other mockbusters, including Wanted: Perfect Father, a comedy-drama based on the 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire, and Tataynic, a 1998 parody of James Cameron's Titanic. Other Filipino knockoffs include Bobo Cop (a parody of RoboCop) and Rocky Plus V (a spoof of the Rocky series). Turkish cinema was known, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, for knockoff films done at a cheap, amateur level. The Man who Saved the World became infamous for its theft of clips and songs from Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, so much so that the film is popularly known as \\"Turkish Star Wars\\" in English-speaking realms, where it typifies the concept of so bad, it's good. Three Giant Men involved a battle between Marvel Comics characters Spider-Man and Captain America, both unauthorized and dressed in cheap costumes, decades before Captain America: Civil War covered the same concept to greater success. Legality Mockbusters based on popular animated films are known as a \\"drafting opportunity.\\" For example, Kiara the Brave (a mockbuster of Pixar's Brave) and Puss in Boots: A Furry Tale (a mockbuster of Puss in Boots) use soundalike titling to \\"draft off\\" the marketing success (\\"slipstream\\") of popular films. \\"Can you trademark an actual noun? The idea of a battleship?,\\" asks Boxoffice magazine editor Amy Nicholson. The original Puss in Boots was made by DreamWorks Animation by 300 people working for four years at the cost of $130 million. The mockbuster, with nearly exactly the same name was made by 12 people, in six months, for less than $1 million. For these large production houses, it wasn't just a question of free riding on the marketing success of these more popular films; mockbusters have become a source of bad publicity. Customers who had accidentally bought the mockbuster Puss in Boots: A Furry Tale but did not know that it was a mockbuster gave the original movie bad reviews. Mockbuster producers have had no legal troubles with drafting off as a result of Disney losing a case against GoodTimes Entertainment, which had used similar packaging for their own version of Aladdin. Mockbusters have also had legal complications with false advertising. They supposedly tweak the plot lines and the titles just enough to skirt legal trouble and yet ride on the publicity of major blockbusters. Until the Hobbit case, mockbuster production houses have been able to achieve soundalike titling to such an extent that even actors in the movies have been confused about which movie they are starring in. Some actors starring in the original have gone on to become fans of the mockbuster model. Kel Mitchell was the star in the mockbuster Battle of Los Angeles, the mockbuster to the original Battle: Los Angeles. His friend was in the original and they began promoting both movies together. Kel has since then became a fan of the studio's formula: \\"I laugh out loud when I see that a film is coming out; I wonder what The Asylum is going to do with it. They're going to remix that name and put it out.\\" In December 2013, The Walt Disney Company filed in California federal court to get an injunction against the continued distribution of the French film The Legend of Sarila, retitled Frozen Land. In their suit, Disney alleges: \\"To enhance the commercial success of Sarila, the defendant redesigned the artwork, packaging, logo, and other promotional materials for its newly (and intentionally misleadingly) retitled film to mimic those used by [Disney] for Frozen and related merchandise.\\" The suit was filed against distributor Phase 4 Films. =Intent to deceive= Because mockbusters are deliberately similar to more famous movies, some movie studios have sued mockbuster studios for allegedly tricking consumers into renting or purchasing the wrong movie through intentionally deceptive marketing. In one such lawsuit, Walt Disney Pictures sued the UK-based studio Brightspark, complaining that the studio was \\"misleading consumers with numerous releases that confuse and undermine the trust those consumers have in Disney.\\" Among Brightspark's films mentioned in the lawsuit were Braver, Tangled Up, The Frog Prince, and Little Cars, which resemble Disney's Brave, Tangled, The Princess and the Frog, and Cars, respectively. Warner Bros. similarly sued The Asylum over their release of Age of the Hobbits. The judge ruled in favor of Warner Bros., writing that \\"There is substantial likelihood that consumers will be confused by Age Of Hobbits and mistakenly purchase the film intending to purchase The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.\\" Most mockbusters follow the trend of releasing their movies close to the release dates of the original: * Jack the Giant Killer came out on March 12, 2013, Jack the Giant Slayer on March 1, 2013. * Hansel & Gretel came out January 8, 2013, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters came out January 17, 2013. * Grimm's Snow White, Snow White and the Huntsman and Mirror Mirror were all released in 2012. * 2009's Sherlock Holmes was followed by 2010's Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes from The Asylum. The Asylum defend this practice, stating their intention is not to dupe customers. The Asylum cites reports from both Blockbuster LLC and Hollywood Video that show that less than 1% of customers who rent one of their films ask for a refund. That the low return rate of their films has been used to argue that consumers are renting The Asylum's films deliberately. \\"There's a segment of people who watch them because they know they're bad and they're funny, and they're fun to make fun of with their friends,\\" says Kyle Ryan, the managing editor of The A.V. Club, a sister publication of The Onion. =The Asylum v. Warner Bros., 2012= In 2012, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, WingNut Films, and The Saul Zaentz Company (SZC) sued The Asylum for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, trademark dilution, false advertising, and unfair competition. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant's movie title Age of the Hobbits infringed the registered trademarks held by SZC in the designation \\"Hobbit.\\" Unlike fairytales, which are in the public domain, the J. R. R. Tolkien novels have been exclusively licensed to Warner Bros. and SZC for production and film adaptation. The court described Global Asylum (the defendant in this case) as a low-budget company that makes \\"mockbusters\\" of popular movies with similar titling. Warner Bros. and SZC submitted evidence to prove that consumers would be confused by the identical title and that they would lose not only ticket sales but also DVD revenue. The evidence included a survey showing that 48 percent of 400 surveyed respondents associated the term “Hobbit” with SZC, d/b/a “Tolkien Enterprises” and Tolkien properties. A separate survey conducted by Nielsen National Research Group showed that approximately 16 to 24 percent of survey respondents were confused about the source of Age of the Hobbits. The Asylum claimed that they were justified in using the word \\"Hobbit\\" as a fair use of scientific terminology after some scientists borrowed the term from the Hobbit stories a few years prior to describe a human subspecies in Indonesia. The Asylum argued that it provided warnings stating that this was not the Tolkien creature. The films also featured major plot differences: \\"In an ancient age, the small, peace-loving Hobbits are enslaved by the Java Men, a race of flesh-eating dragon-riders. The young Hobbit Goben must join forces with their neighbor giants, the humans, to free his people and vanquish their enemies.\\" The Federal Court found that Warner Bros. had a valid trademark on the word \\"Hobbit\\". The court rejected The Asylum's scientific fair-use claims since there was no evidence to suggest that the movie was about a prehistoric group of people who lived in Indonesia. The court rejected all of The Asylum's defenses: (i) that it was permitted to use “Hobbits” in the title of its film pursuant to the free speech test of the Second Circuit’s decision in Rogers v. Grimaldi, (ii) that its use of the mark constituted nominative fair use to indicate plaintiffs' movies and (iii) that the “Hobbits” mark was a generic name. The court decided that The Asylum had failed to prove its defenses and on December 10, 2012, found in favor of the plaintiffs and entered a temporary restraining order. This restraining order prevented the use by Global Asylum of the title Age of the Hobbits. The Ninth Circuit court of appeals affirmed in 2013. The film was then released under the name Clash of the Empires. Pornographic movies Successful films frequently spawn pornographic knock-offs with punned titles. Examples include: Gilligan's Bi-Land (Gilligan's Island), Edward Penishands (Edward Scissorhands), Kinky Kong (King Kong), Foreskin Gump (Forrest Gump), Raiders of the Lost Arse (Raiders of the Lost Ark), Flesh Gordon (Flash Gordon), and The Devil in Miss Jones (The Devil and Miss Jones). Some pornographic movies are mockbusters of other pornographic movies. For example, the 1985 film Black Throat is a mockbuster of an earlier, popular pornographic film, 1972's Deep Throat. Pornographic films are particularly prone to unauthorized sequels; Debbie Does Dallas, a 1978 porn film, spawned at least eleven sequels, most of which were never explicitly authorized by the original production team or cast. In other media The term has also been used for media besides film, such as video games capitalizing on the success of a known franchise like Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty. A notable example of this are games developed by the French studio Gameloft. Most of the games in their portfolio bear similarities to popular video game series, with reviewers commenting about Gameloft’s emulation of those games experiences brought onto mobile platforms.

Keep on Truckin' is a one-page comic by Robert Crumb. It was published in the first issue of Zap Comix in 1968. A visual riff on the lyrics of the Blind Boy Fuller song \\"Truckin' My Blues Away\\", it consists of an assortment of men, drawn in Crumb's distinctive style, strutting confidently across various landscapes. The strip's drawings became iconic images of optimism during the hippie era. Crumb was offered $100,000 by Toyota to reproduce the image for a Keep On Truckin' advertising campaign, but turned it down. Copyright issues The copyright on this image has been repeatedly violated, and it has been widely reproduced on T-shirts, posters, belt buckles, mudflaps, and other items. In the early 1970s, Crumb's lawyer started threatening lawsuits against anyone using the image without permission. Crumb and A.A. Sales, a producer of unlicensed Keep On Truckin' merchandise, reached a settlement of $750 for the past usage. But A.A. continued to sell unlicensed products after the settlement without paying additional license fees. In 1973, Crumb went to the U.S. Federal Court, and wound up in the courtroom of Judge Albert Charles Wollenberg, who had previously ruled against the Air Pirates. A.A. Sales claimed the work was in the public domain, because Crumb had not included the copyright symbol on the work, although he had in Zap #1 as a whole. The work was covered under the 1909 Copyright Act, and any omission of notice caused the work to be public domain. The drawing had appeared on the business card of Crumb's publisher without the copyright symbol. Based on that, Wollenberg granted A.A. Sales' request for summary judgment and Keep on Truckin' became public domain. In 1977, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed that decision, and it returned to copyrighted status. Recently, Crumb has sued various entities to defend the copyright, including Amazon.com in 2005. Crumb's notions Crumb uses the strip as a prime example of the discomfort he felt with his sudden fame in the late 1960s, saying: In 1972, Crumb published a one-page self- parody of Keep on Truckin', which introduced a variety of new poses and slogans, including \\"Keep on Rollin' Along,\\" \\"Keep on Chunkin',\\" \\"Keep on Toodlin',\\" and so on. The strip was covered in copyright symbols, and ended with an ironic suggestion that readers buy \\"Keep on Shuckin'\\" merchandise.Crumb, Robert. \\"Keep on Trucking'?\\" ZYX Comics (Kitchen Sink Press, June 1972). Trivia Keep on Truckin' was parodied by The Perry Bible Fellowship. The comic depicts two laboratory mice imagining themselves strutting through a land of sunshine and rainbows, in a manner similar to the original comic, after being exposed to LSD by researchers.

Merrell Chemical Company in the 1940s. It is currently known only in scientific research and has never been developed for market use. Cypenamine is currently legal throughout the entire world, and though its chemical structure has a vague similarity to certain controlled stimulants like fencamfamine, it is likely that it is too distant for it to be considered an illicit analogue under the United States Federal Analogue Act of the Controlled Substances Act. Chemistry =Stereochemistry= 2-Phenylcyclopentan-1-amine is a compound with two stereocenters. Thus, the following two enantiomeric pairs may exist: * (1RS,2SR)-trans-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine * (1RS,2RS)-cis-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine The racemate (±)-trans-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine [1:1 mixture of (1R,2S)-trans-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine (box, left) and (1S,2R)-trans-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine (box, right)] is the active ingredient of cypenamine. Furthermore, the kinetic resolution of (±)-trans-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine by lipase B from Candida antarctica may be effectively performed by an aminolysis reaction. Racemic cis-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine [1:1 mixture of (1R,2R)-cis-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine and (1S,2S)-cis-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine] has found no pharmacological application. =Homology= Cypenamine is a homolog of tranylcypromine, containing an expanded alicyclic ring that is two methylene units larger than the highly strained/reactive cyclopropane. The cyclohexane homologue has been reported, although the LD50s were all less than for plain amphetamine, it was still a functional stimulant.

Taxonomy Vidua orientalis has often been considered a subspecies of eastern paradise whydah, Vidua paradisea, since both birds parasitise the green-winged pytilia, Pytilia melba, a common species of estrildid finch. However, the finch has two subspecies, nominate melba and citerior, which are sometimes treated as separate species. The ranges of these two taxa correspond well to those of V.paradisea and V. orientalis. Subspecies * Vidua orientalis orientalis (from Chad to Sudan and Eritrea.) Avibase * Vidua orientalis kadugliensis * Vidua orientalis aucupum (from Senegal to northwestern Nigeria) Distribution and habitat Vidua orientalis is a resident breeding bird in west Africa. It lives in open acacia savannah with scattered trees. Description The males in breeding plumage have black back and wings, with a rufous breast.

Also juveniles are quite to the hens.The Paradise Whydahs Species Factsheet - Finch Information Center Biology and behavior The Sahel paradise whydah does not build its own nests, but parasitises the green-winged pytilia, Pytilia melba, a common species of estrildid finch. These birds do not destroy the host green-winged pytilia's eggs, but they deposit their own eggs in the nests of their hosts, adding them to those already present. As in other whydah species to attract hens the songs of the males mimic the song of their hosts. These birds are not monogamous pairs, in fact males breed with many females. In a breeding season females may lay about 22 eggs, that hatch after 12–13 days of incubation. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.

Through approaching mythology as language, Lévi-Strauss suggests that it can be approached the same way as language can be approached by the same structuralist methods used to address language. Thus, Lévi-Strauss offers a structuralist theory of mythology;Markus Gabriel, Slavoj Žižek, Mythology, Madness, and Laughter: Subjectivity in German Idealism, Continuum, 2009, p. 61. he clarifies, \\"Myth is language, functioning on an especially high level where meaning succeeds practically at 'taking off' from the linguistic ground on which it keeps rolling.\\"Structural Anthropology, p. 210 Overview Lévi-Strauss breaks down his argument into three main parts. Meaning is not isolated within the specific fundamental parts of the myth, but rather within the composition of these parts. Although myth and language are of similar categories, language functions differently in myth. Language in myth exhibits more complex functions than in any other linguistic expression. From these suggestions, he draws the conclusion that myth can be broken down into constituent units, and these units are different from the constituents of language. Finally, unlike the constituents of language, the constituents of a myth, which he labels “mythemes,” function as \\"bundles of relations.\\"Structural Anthropology, p. 211 This approach is a break from the “symbolists”, such as Carl Jung, who dedicate themselves to find meaning solely within the constituents rather than their relations.Marcel Hanéff, Claude Lévi-Strauss, p. 160 For instance, Lévi-Strauss uses the example of the Oedipus myth and breaks it down to its component parts: Reading it in sequence from left to right, top to bottom, the myth is categorized sequentially and by similarities. Through analyzing the commonalities between the “mythemes” of the Oedipus story, understandings can be wrought from its categories. Thus, a structural approach towards myths is to address all of these constituents. Furthermore, a structural approach should account for all versions of a myth, as all versions are relevant to the function of the myth as a whole. This leads to what Lévi-Strauss calls a spiral growth of the myth that is continuous while the structure itself is not. The growth of the myth only ends when the “intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted.”Structural Anthropology, p. 229  From mythology to literary criticism  Myths are primarily acknowledged as oral traditions, while literature is in the form of written text. Still, anthropologists and literary critics both acknowledge the links between myths and relatively more contemporary literature. Therefore, many literary critics take the same Lévi- Straussian structuralist, as it is coined, approach to literature. This approach is, again, similar to Symbolist critics’ approach to literature. There is a search for the lowest constituent of the story. But as with the myth, Lévi-Straussian structuralism then analyzes the relations between these constituent parts in order to compare even greater relations between versions of stories as well as among stories themselves.James A. Boon, From Symbolism to Structuralism. p. 6-12. Furthermore, Lévi-Strauss suggests that the structural approach and mental processes dedicated towards analyzing the myth are similar in nature to those in science. This connection between myth and science is further elaborated in his books, Myth and Meaning and The Savage Mind. He suggests that the foundation of structuralism is based upon an innate understanding of the scientific process, which seeks to break down complex phenomena into its component parts and then analyze the relations between them. The structuralist approach to myth is precisely the same method, and as a method this can be readily applied to literature.Myth and Meaning p.5-14  References   Sources  *Boon, James A.

Built in 1894, this Chateauesque lakefront mansion was from 1909 until his death the home of Charles Gates Dawes (1865–1951) and his family. Dawes earned the 1925 Nobel Peace Prize for his plan to alleviate the crushing burden of war reparations Germany was required to pay after World War I. Dawes served as U.S. Vice President under Calvin Coolidge, a general during World War I, and as United States Ambassador to Great Britain. Dawes was a descendant of William Dawes, who along with Paul Revere, rode to alarm the colonists that the British regulars were coming on the night before the Revolutionary War began. The house, a National Historic Landmark, is now owned by the Evanston History Center (formerly known as the Evanston Historical Society), which offers tours.  History  Memorial plaque to the right of the front doorCharles G. Dawes and family lived here from 1909 to 1951. He donated the house to Northwestern University in 1944 with the understanding that it be used as the home of the Evanston Historical Society, now known as the Evanston History Center. The Dawes family continued to occupy it until Mrs. Caro Blymer Dawes' death in 1957, and it became home to the Historical Society in 1960. In 2009, Northwestern University donated the house to the Evanston History Center. Architect The house was built in 1894 for Robert Sheppard, treasurer and business manager of Northwestern University, and designed by H. Edwards Ficken (1844–1929) of New York. Ficken was born in London and educated in Europe. He came to the United States in 1869 and began his career as an architectural renderer, Brown, Elizabeth Mills New Haven, a Guide to Architecture and Urban Design: 15 Illustrated Tours, 1976. New Haven, Yale University Press , p. 137. and was the partner of Boston architect Charles G. Gambrill at the time of the latter's suicide in September 1880. Gambrill had been a partner of Henry Hobson Richardson from 1867 to 1878. Ficken's career included several distinguished commissions, including ones for the New York Athletic Club and Yale University Pinnell, Patrick. A Campus Guide: Yale University – an Architectural Tour with Patrick Pinnell. New York, Princeton Architectural Press, 1999 , pp 142, 189. and, for the last thirteen years of his life he was the supervising architect and engineer for Woodlawn Cemetery Website for The Woodlawn Cemetery on Long Island. Ficken is perhaps best known, however, as the architect for Pepperidge Hall (1896), a 120-room house built for Christopher Roberts II on of property that was adjacent to Idle Hour, the 60-room Tudor mansion of William K. Vanderbilt that was designed by Richard Morris Hunt and located on in Oakdale, New York. Long Island Memories Website of the Long Island Library The architecture Front facade, W.W. Kimball HouseEast facade, John A. McGill House, 4938 S. Drexel Blvd. Chicago, Henry Ives Cobb, architect The house is considered to be an example of the Chateauesque style of architecture, but in many respects it is not typical. The style was introduced to the United States in 1882 by Richard Morris Hunt, the first American architect to attend the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, when he built a palace in the style at 660 Fifth Avenue in New York for Alva and William Kissam Vanderbilt (demolished, 1926). A brief history and photograph of the Vanderbilt House.* Period image of the Vanderbilt House, 660 Fifth Ave., New York Architects of the time who attempted to create pure examples of the style emulated the features of the 16th Century chateaux of the Loire Valley in France, usually sheathing the buildings with limestone and decorating them with elaborate Renaissance carving. Perhaps the best example of this style remaining in Chicago is the house at 1801 S. Prairie Ave. City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division. Early 20th century image of Prairie Ave., Kimball house, left (see picture) that was designed in 1890 by Solon Spencer Beman and built for the piano manufacturer William W. Kimball at a reputed cost of one million dollars. The house, which the noted author and essayist Thomas Schlereth from The University of Notre Dame called \\"a brilliant exercise in the chateau style\\", was designed using exterior features from the 16th Century remodeling of the Chateau de Josselin in Brittany. Certainly the best example ever built in the United States is the 225-room Biltmore House (1888–1895), the home of George Washington Vanderbilt II constructed in Asheville, NC, which was also designed by Hunt. The detailing of the Dawes house represents more the flavor of rural French architecture, and in this respect has more in common with the rustic character of Grey Towers, the much larger home of Gifford Pinchot outside of Milford, Pennsylvania that was designed largely by Hunt in 1886, but in which Ficken had a hand in some of the details. Even a quick study of the Dawes house, Grey Towers, Grey Towers – a History. From the website of The Forest History Society and the more formally detailed John A. McGill house (1892) in Chicago (see picture) will show how closely they are all related to each other and to their French antecedents, especially to the Château de Chambord at Chambord, Loir-et-Cher in France. Idaho State University – Le Conseil Francais gallery photograph retrieved October 28, 2008 Richard Morris Hunt became the leading proponent of French-inspired architecture after his return to the United States from his studies in Europe in 1855.

Built in 1865, it was the home of Frances Willard (1839-1898) and her family, and was the longtime headquarters of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Willard called the house Rest Cottage because it became a place for her to rest in between her tours and WCTU activities. History Frances Willard was born in 1839 in Churchville, New York. When she was two, her family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, a town recently founded by ministers who wanted to build a community with strong Christian morals. When she was 18, Willard moved with her family to Evanston, Illinois, to attend the Northwestern Female College. She spent the next sixteen years of her life as an educator at a variety of institutions across the county. In 1865, her father Josiah, who stayed in Evanston, built a house, which remains as the southern portion of the current structure. Frances Willard returned to Evanston and moved in with her father in 1871 when she accepted a position as Dean of the Women's College at Northwestern. Unhappy with the role of women at the university, and frequently at odds with University President Charles Henry Fowler, Willard resigned three years later. Willard's resignation prompted a change in her life. She resumed her position as a travelling educator, but began to focus on the study of temperance. In the summer of 1874, Willard travelled around the East Coast to meet with other temperance advocates. She also became a noted public speaker on the virtue. Returning to Evanston, she helped to found the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and was elected its first corresponding secretary and first president of the Chicago chapter. Her brother Oliver died in 1878, and Frances decided to expand her Evanston home that April to accommodate his widow and four children. The next year, she was elected President of the WCTU. After her brother's family moved to Germany, Willard began to rent out the northern section of her house to friends and fellow WCTU members. This section soon became used as an informal headquarters for the WCTU under Willard. Willard died in 1898 and left the entire house to the WCTU in her will. Two years later, the WCTU made the house in Evanston its national headquarters. The WCTU also made the house into a museum dedicated to Willard in that year. In 1910, the organization built the Literature Building in the rear of the property. The Willard House in 1967 On June 23, 1965, the house was declared a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service. When the National Register of Historic Places was founded a year later, it was automatically listed. It was surveyed by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1967. Museum tours are now offered to the public on the first and third Sundays of every month. Architecture The original 1865 house was probably based on a pattern book. It was an L-shaped building with vertical board and batten siding. The 1878 addition was consistent with the architectural form of the house but greatly expanded it. Proceeds from the sale of Willard's autobiography were used to add large bay windows on the main facade around 1890. Willard made another addition in 1893. The two-story house is in the Carpenter Gothic style. It is painted pearl grey and has white trim. The front of the house has two columned porches. Three small porches lead to other entrances, and the second floor has a balcony on the rear. The three gables on the main facade have decorative trim and a turned finial in the center. There are seventeen rooms in the house, most with oak and walnut flooring.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Crow Island School was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois). Background Progressive education flourished in the 1920s and continued to develop in the 1930s. However, because of economic hardship during the Great Depression, few new schools had been built to accommodate the movement. Carleton Washburne was a regional leader in progressive thought and, as superintendent of schools in Winnetka, Illinois, sought to establish a new school. Larry Perkins, Philip Will, Jr., and Todd Wheeler had recently formed the architectural firm and this was one of their first commissions. Perkins was the son of Dwight H. Perkins, the former Chief Architect for the Chicago Board of Education; the elder Perkins designed two schools in Winnetka. The Perkins family had connections on the Winnetka School Board as well as superintendent Washburne. Although Washburne was interested in the firm's modern approach to architecture, he was concerned about their lack of experience. He changed his mind when Larry Perkins suggested a collaboration with Eliel and Eero Saarinen. The Saarinens, who were interested in an innovative educational project, agreed for the two firms to collaborate. Design Perkins, Wheeler & Will was responsible for the bulk of the early design. They interviewed students and teachers about the project and sat in on classes. They had to design the building for the modest sum of $287,000 in construction cost. A site for the school was selected on Crow Island, a high spot in the Skokie Marsh bordering the Crow Island Woods. The swamp was filled with landfill from two Works Progress Administration projects in the area: the Skokie Lagoons Project and a track depression for the Chicago and North Western Railway. John McFadzean and Robert Everly were consulted to design a park-like atmosphere for the school grounds. The school has four wings emerging from a central building with common rooms. This design allows each classroom to have its own outdoor courtyard. Each wing also has its own playground, two of which feature experimental examples of a jungle gym. The Saarinens designed a hexagonal sandbox for the northwest wing. The main entrance is under a chimney overhang on the west, with an additional entrance for the kindergarten on the east. The one-story building is flat with the exception of a chimney emerging from the north face, providing a \\"fifth wing\\" stretching vertically. The school was one of the first to be designed in the international style of architecture in North America. Its aesthetics and form, although not its planning or educational model, soon became a template for mid-century and factory model schools.Why Don't All Schools Look Like This?, Zach Mortice, The Atlantic CityLab, October 29, 2015. Retrieved 2016-03-28 Perkins, Wheeler & Will used the profits from the design to commission Hedrich Blessing Photographers to photograph the building. Perkins & Will would go on to design over five hundred schools.

Most members of the family are tropical, whereas Roscoea species are native to mountainous regions of the Himalayas, China and its southern neighbours. Roscoea flowers superficially resemble orchids, although they are not related. The flowers of Roscoea have a complicated structure, in which some of the showy coloured parts are not formed by petals, but by staminodes, sterile stamens which have evolved to become like petals. Some species are grown as ornamental plants in gardens. Description Roscoea is found from Kashmir through the Himalayas to Vietnam, extending northwards into China. There are up to 22 recognized species, of which 8 are endemic to China. Typically they grow in grassland, in screes or on the edges of deciduous woodland at heights of , coming into growth at the start of the monsoon season. Species of Roscoea are small perennial herbaceous plants. They die back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which the tuberous roots are attached. Like many members of the Zingiberales (the order to which the gingers belong), Roscoea has \\"pseudostems\\": structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases of its leaves (\\"sheaths\\"). The leaves are without a stalk (petiole). Lower leaves may consist solely of a sheath; upper leaves have a blade which is free from the pseudostem, and is oblong or lanceolate (i.e. considerably longer than it is wide). The relative number of bladeless versus complete leaves is one distinguishing feature of the two clades into which the genus is divided. The flowers are borne in a spike at the end of the pseudostems. The stalk (peduncle) bearing the flowers may be long, so that the flowers appear well above the leaves, or short, so that they appear between the upper leaf sheaths. Like other members of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), Roscoea flowers have a complex structure (superficially resembling that of an orchid, although they are not related). Each flower has a tube-shaped outer calyx, which is split on one side and ends in two or three teeth. The petals are joined together at the base, and then divide into three lobes. The central lobe is upright and usually forms a hood; the two side lobes are narrower than the central one. The flower then has what appear to be three inner petals, which are actually formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes). Two lateral staminodes form what look like upright petals, often also hooded in shape; two other staminodes are fused together to form a prominent central \\"lip\\" or labellum.Some sources use the term \\"staminode\\" only for the lateral staminodes. See e.g. . Flower of Roscoea cautleyoides showing the petals and staminodes The single fertile stamen has a short filament bearing a cylindrical anther. The connective tissue between the anther's two pollen sacs extends outwards at its base to form spurs. The ovary has three \\"cells\\" or locules, eventually producing many small arillate seeds. The single functional style extends upwards through a grove in the stamen to appear above its top. Flower of Roscoea auriculata showing the \\"spurs\\" on the stamen =Flower structure and pollination= The orchid-like flowers with a long floral tube appear to be an adaptation for pollination by long-tongued insects specializing in this type of flower. The design of the flower suggests that the lip acts as a landing platform and that if a pollinator puts its head into the flower in order to obtain nectar, it will push down on the spurs on the stamen, causing the anther (and the stigma which is held in front of it) to bend over and contact the insect's back. However, in the only two species so far studied in detail (R. cautleyoides and R. humeana), the actual pollinators were short-tongued pollen-collecting bees. In at least one species, R. schneideriana, it has been shown that if cross-pollination does not occur, the stigma bends over towards the anthers, thus effecting self-pollination. One suggestion is that although the original pollinators may have been long- tongued insects, these are now absent from at least some of the areas where Roscoea occurs, so that the genus has been able to survive in its alpine habitats through the presence of generalist pollinators and self- compatibility. Taxonomy Roscoea was named by the English botanist James Edward Smith in 1806. The type species is R. purpurea. The name honours Smith's friend William Roscoe, the founder of the Liverpool Botanic Garden (remnants of which can now be found at Croxteth Hall). Roscoe is known to have been interested in \\"gingers\\" (Zingiberales) and to have grown a number of collections of this group of plants. Evolution and phylogeny A 2002 classification of the family Zingiberaceae, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis, placed Roscoea in the tribe Zingibereae, subfamily Zingiberoideae. It was most closely related to the genus Cautleya, and then to Rhynchanthus, Pommereschea and Hedychium. The family is mainly tropical in distribution. The unusual mountainous distribution of Roscoea and the closely related Cautleya may have evolved relatively recently as a response to the uplift taking place in the region in the last 50 million years or so due to the collision of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of 15 species of Roscoea, based on nuclear ribosomal DNA, showed that the genus was monophyletic, and distinct from the closely related genus Cautleya. The 15 species fell into two clear groups, a Himalayan clade and a Chinese clade (which includes one species from Burma, R. australis). Distribution of Roscoea according to ; Himalayan clade shown in blue, Chinese clade shown in red. Black circle marks the distribution of R. ngainoi, discovered later. The two clades correspond to a geographical separation, the main distributions being divided by the section of the Brahmaputra River which flows south at the end of the Himalayan mountain chain. Historical biogeography study revealed that evolutionary split between Cautleya and Roscoea occurred during the middle and late Eocene to the early Oligocene, corresponding well to the proposed early uplift of the Himalayas and Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Roscoea species were then divided into two distinct clades, simultaneous with the rapid extrusion of Indochina and accompanied by the another Himalayan uplift around the Oligocene/Miocene boundary. It has been suggested that the genus may have originated in this area and then spread westwards along the Himalayas and eastwards into the mountains of China and its southern neighbours, supported by biogeographic reconstruction. Three species have an isolated distribution. R. brandisii, a member of the Himalayan clade, occurs to the south of the rest of the clade in the Khasia Hills in the modern Indian state of Meghalaya (formerly part of the state of Assam). R. australis, a member of the Chinese clade, occurs even further south, in the Chin Hills of Burma. R. ngainoi, discovered after the phylogenetic analysis discussed above, is found roughly between these two species, in the Indian state of Manipur. The material of R. tibetica included in the analysis came from Chinese sources. Later research showed that plants from Bhutan and southern Tibet which had previously been considered to be R. tibetica were actually a new species, R. bhutanica, which belongs to the Himalayan clade. There are few clear-cut morphological differences between the two clades; one is that compared to the Himalayan group, members of the Chinese clade have a larger number of bladeless leaves (i.e. leaves which have only a sheath forming part of the pseudostem).

Coming from monsoon regions, they require moisture in the summer but relatively dry conditions in winter. A moisture-retaining but well-drained soil is recommended, with a mulch of a material such as bark. They vary in their tolerance of sun exposure, most requiring shade for at least part of the day. In a Royal Horticultural Society trial, R. ganeshensis and R. purpurea f. rubra were the most harmed by too much sun; R. cautleyoides, R. × beesiana and R. scillifolia the most resistant. In cultivation they do not appear above ground until late spring or even early summer; thus if planted deeply enough, up to , they escape frost damage in regions where subzero temperatures occur. Different species and cultivars then flower throughout late spring and summer into early autumn. They can be propagated by careful division in the autumn of the individual growth points produced by a large plant, or by seed. Seed should not be allowed to dry out. If sown immediately it is ripe, it will normally germinate in the following summer. Young plants should be potted on before the tuberous roots become too intertwined. =RHS trial= From 2009 to 2011, the Royal Horticultural Society held a trial involving around 100 entries submitted by British and other European sources. All proved hardy (rating H4, i.e. hardy anywhere in the British Isles).

Suicide, the act of deliberately killing oneself, is a prominent action in many important works of literature. Authors use the suicide of a character to portray defiance, despair, love, or honor. Whether it is written as the ultimate act of devotion or the result of depression, the act of suicide was and is a prevalent action within the context of English literature. Novels According to Lorna Ruth Wiedmann, novelistic suicide patterns first emerged in the nineteenth century. She categorized nineteenth-century works based on five themes: ‘murder-followed- by-suicide; the survivor of suicide; age and the suicide; the suicide’s choice of method; and gender and suicide.’Wiedmann, Lorna Ruth, “Suicide in American Fiction, 1798-1909” (diss. University of Wisconsin–Madison, 1995) Kevin Grauke stated that suicide serves an \\"ambivalent rhetorical function\\" Grauke, Kevin, \\"I cannot bear to be hurted anymore\\" Suicide as Dialectical Ideological Sign in Nineteenth-Century American Realism in the works of the nineteenth-century. Authors such as Kate Chopin, Ernest Hemingway, and Virginia Woolf include themes of suicide in their writing. Shakespeare William Shakespeare's characters commit suicide in several of his plays. Perhaps most famously, the young lovers Romeo and Juliet both commit suicide in the final scene of Romeo and Juliet. Suicide also occurs in Julius Caesar when Brutus and Cassius both kill themselves. Othello commits suicide with a dagger after murdering his love in a crime of passion in Othello. The play Antony and Cleopatra ends with five suicides, including the deaths of both Antony and Cleopatra.>Wymer, Rowland, Suicide in the Plays of Shakespeare Ophelia commits suicide in Hamlet following the death of her father. Controversy The subject of suicide itself is controversial. While the act of suicide can be symbolic in literature, the act itself still possesses the ability to cause controversy in the real world. Kate Chopin's novel, The Awakening, was extremely controversial when it was released in 1899. Some authors who have created characters that commit suicide have committed suicide themselves. Ernest Hemingway shot himself in 1961; Some of his short stories included suicidal themes.Berman, Jeffrey, Surviving Literary Suicide (University of Massachusetts Press, 1999) The poet Sylvia Plath committed suicide by self- asphyxiation in 1963. Quotations “Once suicide was accepted as a common fact of society- not as a noble Roman alternative, nor as the mortal sin it had been in the Middle Ages, nor as a special cause to be pleaded or warned against- but simply as something people did, often and without much hesitation, like committing adultery, then it automatically became a common property of art.\\" - diaz, 1971.Alvarez, A.

The building was formerly a brewery that belonged to the Kaitakushi, the old government of Hokkaidō prefecture, and later owned by the Sapporo Beer Company, the predecessor of the Sapporo Brewery. Currently, the Sapporo Factory is run by the Yebisu Garden Place, a subsidiary of Sapporo Holdings Ltd., and a real estate company. The original brewery building was built in 1876, and after the brewery ceased to function in beer production, the operations were moved to a new location in Eniwa, in 1993.  History  In 1875, the former government of Hokkaidō prefecture, Kaitakushi, made a decision to construct a brewery at the official garden in Aoyama, Tokyo, which was created in 1871 and located close to where Aoyama Gakuin University currently sits.the official garden in Aoyama The Kaitakushi's original plan was to cultivate imported plants and vegetables in Tokyo and bring them to Hokkaidō; it was thought that imported plants mainly from Europe might not suit the frigid climate in Hokkaidō.The story of Hisanari Murahashi Some Kaitakushi officials also contemplated acquiring wide recognition of the modern agricultural technology in Europe and what the Kaitakushi has done, by planting foreign vegetations or introducing expensive farming instruments, and inviting officials and the emperor of Japan to that garden in Aoyama. Seibei Nakagawa, who had studied the brewing technology in Germany, was appointed chief engineer of the Kaitakushi Brewery in Aoyama, as well as Hisanari Murahashi (born in Kagoshima Prefecture and one of the Satsuma students to travel to England in 1868) as the manager of the official garden. Nakagawa had learned that abundant ice was required to brew beer in the German brewing method, and that led Murahashi to petition the government to change the location of the brewery to Hokkaidō. His petition was approved by the government, and the brewery was planned to be built in Sapporo. On September 23, 1876, the Kaitakushi Brewery was built where the Sapporo factory is currently located.The birthplace of the Sapporo beer On the inauguration, beer barrels were piled in front of the building. These were eventually restored and are currently placed on the grounds of the Sapporo Beer Museum. The brewery building was made of wood at first, and later enlarged with red brick as the beer made in Sapporo gradually become well known throughout the country. In 1882, the Kaitakushi was abolished due to financial difficulties, and buildings built by the Kaitakushi were liquidated. In January 1886, the Kaitakushi Brewery belonged to the newly established Hokkaidō Prefectural Government, and later its jurisdiction switched to private ownership. The brewery kept brewing, and the Sapporo Beer Company was established in 1888, with the result that the brewery would be under the control of the company. The brewery was operated until operations were moved to the factory in Eniwa, a city close to Sapporo. After the brewery was moved, plans to preserve the building as a commercial complex were developed, and in 1993, the building was renovated as the Sapporo Factory. The building was constructed by the Taisei Corporation and designed by Minoru Takeyama, an artist who also designed the Shibuya 109 in Tokyo and the Seoul Station in South Korea. On November 2, 2006, the Frontier-kan supermarket was added to the south area.  Overview  The western side of the Renga-kan The Sapporo Factory consists of 7 sections: 1 Jō-kan (1st block building), 2 Jō-kan (2nd block building), 3 Jō-kan (3rd block building), the Atrium, Renga-kan (red brick building), Frontier-kan (Frontier building), and Nishi-kan (West building). The buildings of the 2 Jō- kan, 3 Jō-kan and Atrium are combined, and connect to other buildings with access roads. The 2 Jō-kan has 4 stories, and the Frontier-kan has 9 stories, 5 of them are used as the parking lot. The 1 Jō-kan houses the Toys \\"R\\" Us shop and a multiplex called the \\"United Cinema Sapporo\\". Most of the clothing, hardware, furniture stores and restaurants in the Sapporo Factory are housed in the 2 Jō-kan, 3 Jō-kan. The 2 Jō-kan also houses the Sapporo Meissen Porcelain Museum at the 4th floor. The Frontier-kan was built most recently in the complex, and the Tokyu department is now located on the ground floor, with office floors in the 3rd and 4th floors. The Nishi Khan is composed of the Hotel Clubby Sapporo, the Sapporo Factory Fitness Club, and the Sapporo Factory Hall. The hall is a place where many events have been held, it has been the venue for a number of musical events. The Renga-kan houses some restaurants, and the museum of the Kaitakushi Brewery. One of the symbols of the complex, a black colored, tall chimney with the word \\"Sapporo Beer\\" on it is standing on the square next to the museum. Open beer gardens are often held in front of the western side of the Renga-kan in summer. In the Atrium, many plants are placed alongside the pathway, and glass windows are fitted into the roof, making the Atrium filled with sunlight during the daytime. A large television is installed on the south side of the Atrium. During Christmas a tall decorated Christmas tree stands at the center.Hokkaido Walker The other sections in the complex are also decorated with lights during Christmas. Transportation The closest station from Sapporo Factory would be Basusentamae station, or if you walk a little more, it will be Ōdōri Station. From Basusentamae, It takes about 5minutes from the station to Sapporo Factory. Both Basusentamae and Odori Station runs through the Tozai line in which you can also remember it as the orange line in the Sapporo underground subway. For Odori Station, Odori Station runs through Tozai line, Namboku line, and Tohou line. From the Basusentamae station to Sapporo Factory, because that there are not much distance, not many shops or restaurants are seen between the two places.

It is named in honor of Army General Fahrettin Altay who commanded the 5th Cavalry Corps in the final stage of the Turkish War of Independence. It is one of the most expensive tank designs with a unit cost of 13.75 million dollars. Debate between Turkish military experts contend that the tank is one of indigenous Turkish origin. History The National Tank Production Project (Turkish: MİTÜP – Milli Tank Üretimi Projesi) was an initiative developed in the mid-1990s to establish independent and robust infrastructure for the production, development and maintenance of main battle tanks used by the Turkish Armed Forces. The project was initiated with an agreement signed between Otokar and the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries of the Republic of Turkey on 30 March 2007, when the Defense Industries Executive Committee awarded a contract worth approximately $500 million to Otokar for the design, development and production of four prototypes of a national main battle tank. This is Turkey's first MBT development program since 1943, when prototypes of a Turkish national tank were produced in Kırıkkale, but never reached full- scale mass production. Otokar, a company owned by Istanbul-based Koç Holding, is one of the major automotive manufacturers in Turkey. Otokar has produced more than 25,000 military vehicles as of 2008. Subsequently, in accordance with the later Defense Industries Executive Committee ruling, subcontractors were selected as follows: * Technical Support and license support : Hyundai Rotem * Fire Control System, Command Control Communication Information System, Laser Warning System, Driver's Vision System, Navigation System, IFF system subcontractor: ASELSAN * 120 mm 55 caliber Primary Weapon subcontractor: state owned MKEK (Mechanical and Chemical Industries Corporation), * Armour subcontractor: ROKETSAN Development In order to improve the current technical capabilities of the Turkish defense industries and increase the amount of domestic contribution towards national defense, the Undersecreteriat for Defense Industries decided that a \\"National Tank\\" will serve as a catalyst for uniting certain Turkish defense companies around a common goal and for providing the Turkish military with extra firepower in the form of a modern tank. The Turkish Ministry of Defense allocated a budget of $1 billion for the development of the Altay. The military electronics company ASELSAN manufactures and integrates the Volkan III modular fire control system, command, control and information systems, while state-owned MKEK (Mechanical and Chemical Industries Corporation) agreed for the production and integration of a modified and licensed produced Rheinmetall 120 mm gun. Another state company ROKETSAN designs an indigenous armor. Once the prototypes are produced and tested, the Undersecreteriat for Defense Industries of the Republic of Turkey will prepare and execute a separate order for the first lot of 250 tanks. A total of 1000 MBTs are planned to be produced in four separate lots of 250 units. Every delivered lot is expected to have additional upgrades. The first 3D image of the MBT was released to the public on 7 April 2010 during a press release by the Undersecreteriat for Defense Industries of the Republic of Turkey. The first prototype Altay was ready for use by the end of 2016. Design The tank is projected to have a smoothbore gun and will include CBRN defense elements, to protect it from chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. The planned maximum speed is set at , provided by an engine (the first two batches will have engines), and the MBTs will be able to function under of water. The tank will benefit both from indigenously developed systems and from the cannon technology of the South Korean K2 Black Panther, accorded by an agreement signed with South Korea. The first two batches will be powered by the MTU engines whereas the last two batches will be powered by an indigenous 1,800 hp engine. On 16 June 2008, SSM and industry members discussed a possible participation for the development of indigenous power pack for use in the armoured personnel carriers and main battle tanks produced in Turkey. Altay appears to share strong chassis characteristics with its technological base, the South Korean K2 Black Panther, with a re-designed Turkish turret and Aselsan's Volkan-III modular fire control system. The tank will be fielded with a STANAG 4579 compatible battlefield target identification system that ensures interoperability among small tank units. There are seven wheels, which translates to a longer hull, heavier armor and increased survivability. This is somewhat offset by offering a larger target size. While moving at high speeds, to evade ATGM attacks, sudden braking and manoeuvering at severe angles are capabilities that were taken into consideration from early developmental stages. An isolated ammunition compartment is designed to protect tank crew, alongside fire and explosion suppression systems which are to activate when hit or when the tank is involved in an accident. The tank is to be equipped with sensors for the detection of contaminated air from chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. =Electric engine= Otokar General Manager Serdar Görgüç has announced that the company is considering the development of an electric engine for the Altay. Görgüç stated that an electric engine would reduce the ability of the enemy to identify the tank with thermal cameras in the field, adding that \\"Vehicles with internal combustion engines can be caught on thermal cameras\\". Otokar developed an electric engine for its buses and is working on retrofitting its design to the Altay tank. Prototypes On 29 April 2009, the Subsecretary for Defence Industries of Turkey, Murad Bayar has confirmed at the 9th IDEX International, Defense Industry Fair in Abu Dhabi, that the Turkish tank will be manufactured using only Turkish resources. He added that the research started last week and that he expected to create an authentic tank model specially designed for the needs of the Turkish Armed Forces within 3 years. As of September 2010, with approval of the tank subsystems and software by Undersecretariat for Defense Industries, Conceptual Design Phase of the Altay project has been completed. Thus, the project advanced to Detailed Design Phase scheduled to last 30.5 months. The scope of the Detailed Design Phase is to design and integrate interfaces for the selected tank subsystems. On 15 October 2010, Otokar signed a contract with MTU and Renk for the supply of power pack. On 15 December 2010, Defence Industry Executive Committee decided to start the development of national power pack. On 10 May 2011, Aselsan was contracted by the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries to design and develop two Battlefield Target Identification Device (BTID) prototypes. On 11 May 2011, the mock-up of the Altay was introduced to the public in IDEF2011. On 18 October 2012, the first Altay was put on trials although lacking side skirts and using a mock-up turret to simulate a real turret. On 16 November 2012, two Altay prototypes successfully passed initial acceptance tests, paving the way for serial production 2 years earlier than expected, with two more prototypes to be built by 2013 or 2014. On 7 November 2016, all prototypes had been delivered to the Turkish Land Forces, and their acceptance tests were expected to finish in the last quarter of 2016 or early 2017. Otokar also completed all infrastructure planning and programming for mass production. Koç Holding Vice Chair and Otokar Chair Ali Koç said mass production was expected to start 18–22 months after their offer was accepted. Foreign interest According to reports, a military envoy from Colombia was present at the 2010 press meeting hosted by the Undersecreteriat for Defense Industries of the Republic of Turkey to obtain more information about the tank. In April 2013, officials of the Saudi Arabian Army reportedly became interested in the Altay main battle tank, and at IDEF-2013, the Azerbaijan Army expressed interest in the Altay tank. Additionally, Otokar placed a bid for 77 Altays for a tender in Oman in August 2013. In January 2016, Turkey reported that the Altay had received interest from Pakistan and Gulf Arab countries.New Turkish-made main battle tank Altay has received interest from Pakistan and Gulf countries – Armyrecognition.com, 1 February 2016 Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have shown interest in procuring the Altay for their armed forces. Qatar officials disclosed plans to procure Altay tanks in March 2019. A few days later a senior Turkish politician stated an order for 100 tanks was placed by Qatar and that the first 40 of these would be delivered in the coming two years. Sales The Altay won the Turkish army contract, estimated at $3.5B and signed on 9 November 2018 for a batch of 250 tanks. Three more similar batches are expected.

It was published in BLAB! #10 in 1998. Synopsis After an opening title card describing the coming feature as \\"Seymour Sunshine and Knishkebibble the Monkey-Boy's Big Budget Fiasco\\", the story begins with a televangelist reading aloud passages from the Book of Revelation describing the seven seals and seven trumpets, accompanied by topical illustrations. The preacher's broadcast is interrupted by a newsflash on the impending end of the millennium. The panel view zooms out slowly from the TV screen into a high-rise apartment and out of a window to reveal a panorama of debauchery, perversion, and random violence. In the background, a glowing meteorite (Wormwood) flies across the sky. Meanwhile, Knishkebibble the Monkey-Boy is shown in another apartment reading the Book of Revelation. He decides to take a relaxing bath to ward off \\"pre-millennium jitters\\". However, while he is drawing his bath the meteorite strikes the earth, causing all the faucets in the bathroom to spew inky black liquid. Knishkebibble runs out of the bathroom and awakens his sleeping companion, Seymour Sunshine. Answering a knock at the door, Seymour and Knishkebibble are confronted by the giant armored locusts described in Revelation. Escaping the apartment, the two scramble across rooftops, leap into a conveniently placed roadster and drive away in haste. The city is being ravaged by a massive earthquake and an army of grinning homunculi carrying long knives. As Seymour and Knishkebibble speed out of the collapsing metropolis, the beast from the sea is shown looming in the background. An army marching under the flag of the beast has taken over the world. Knishkebibble kisses the boots of an army officer and denounces Seymour, who is promptly seized. The seven-headed beast from the earth is shown seated on a throne towering over a crowd of men in white shirts and suspenders giving the Nazi salute, along with Knishkebibble and the televangelist. In the beast's palm, a pocketwatch labeled \\"Years of the Christian Era\\" approaches 2000. On the outskirts of the city, where mass executions by gun and guillotine are underway, Seymour sits with his limbs tied up and a lit stick of dynamite balanced on his head. In the final page (the only one printed in full color) Seymour is shown in a dapper white dress suit and hat, happily frolicking alone in a bucolic paradise. Critical reception \\"The Trumpets They Play!\\" has been cited by critics as an outstanding work, both within Columbia's own output and within the comics medium generally.http://paulgravett.com/index.php/1001_comics/1001_detail/the_trumpets_they_play_blab_10http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/commentary/1148/ In a 2002 essay on Columbia, Paul Gravett called it his \\"most alarming output yet ... a cartoon apocalypse, a black and white Fleischer Brothers animated film as designed by Hieronymus Bosch.\\"\\"Al Columbia: Columbia's Voyage of Discovery\\".

Opo was a wild dolphin that started following fishing boats around Opononi in early 1955. She was originally named \\"Opononi Jack\\", based on Pelorus Jack, since she was presumed to be male. Unlike the majority of dolphins, she had no qualms about human company, and would perform stunts for locals, play with objects like beach balls and beer bottles, and allow children to swim alongside her and make contact. Māori children were more reluctant to play with Opo, as cultural beliefs said the dolphin was a messenger from Kupe. The dolphin became a local celebrity but news of her soon spread, and visitors from throughout the country would come to watch her. On 8 March 1956 official protection for Opo, requested by locals, was made law, but on 9 March she was found dead in a rock crevice at Koutu Point. There were suggestions that she had become stranded while fishing, or that she had been killed by fishermen fishing with gelignite. Her death was reported nationwide, and she was buried with full Māori honours in a special plot next to the Opononi War Memorial Hall. Legacy Statue of Opo the dolphin in Opononi The song \\"Opo the Friendly Dolphin\\" was written by Crombie Murdoch and recorded by Pat McMinnAudioculture - Pat McMinn (coincidentally on the same day Opo died) and was highly popular. A second song was written by Julie Collier in 1988. Several documentary films have been made about Opo. Rudall Hayward made a film called The Amazing Dolphin of Opononi, released in 1956 and shown in 26 countries. Opo was the inspiration for the Maurice Shadbolt novel This Summer's Dolphin and A children's storybook titled Opo the Gay Dolphin by Avis Acres was published by Reed Publishing Ltd. A stone statue of the dolphin playing with a child by Russell Clark was erected in Opononi in 1960. Following vandalism this was replaced by a bronze casting in 2013, with the restored original put on display at the Hokianga Historical Society's Museum at Omapere. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa holds a large number of photographs of Opo taken by Eric Lee-Johnson. A Scottish country dance called Opo was published in 1994. It includes a hey/reel for three with the 1s dancing as a unit and changing the lead on the ends of the heys, a move known as a 'dolphin hey'.

Saint Eustace of Luxeuil (c. 560 – c. 626), also known as Eustasius, was the second abbot of Luxeuil from 611. He succeeded his teacher Saint Columbanus, to whom he had been a favorite disciple and monk. He had been the head of the monastic school. Life Eustace was born in Burgundy and became a monk at Luxeuil. When Columbanus, the founder of Luxeuil, was banished from the Kingdom of Burgundy, on account of his reproving the morals of King Thierry II, the exiled abbot recommended his community to choose Eustace as his successor. Subsequently, Columbanus settled at Bobbio in Italy.Cullen, John. \\"St. Eustace.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 Dec. 2014 After the death of Thierry, Clothaire II sent Eustace to Bobbio to ask Columbanus to return, but he declined.Englebert, Omer. The Lives of the Saints, Barnes & Noble Publishing, 1951 Under the administration of the Abbot Eustace, the monastery acquired renown as a seat of learning and sanctity. Through the royal patronage, its benefices and lands were increased, King Clotaire II devoting a yearly sum, from his own revenues, towards its support. Eustace and his monks devoted themselves to preaching in remote districts, not yet evangelized, chiefly in the north-eastern extremities of Gaul. Their missionary work extended even to Bavaria. Between the monasteries of Luxeuil in France and that of Bobbio in Italy (both founded by St. Columbanus), connection and intercourse seem to have long been kept up. During his abbacy, the monastery contained about 600 monks and produced both bishops and saints, including Acarius, Amatus, Audomar, and Romaric. Eustace was noted for his humility, continual prayer, and fasting. He was succeeded as abbott by Saint Waldebert. A tradition states that he cured Sadalberga of blindness. Upon returning from Bavaria, her father, Gundoin, Duke of Alsace provided hospitality to the abbot on his travels. Duke Gundoin and his wife brought two of their sons for the abbot's blessing but were hesitant to present the blind child. Through the prayers of Abbot Eustace the child was cured of her blindness. He is said to have also procured a cure for St. Burgundofara. His feast day is March 29.

On April 28, 2006, Overnite Transportation officially became UPS Ground Freight, Inc. The logos on the doors of the Overnite tractors were covered with signs showing the operator as UPS Freight. UPS Freight soon changed the color scheme of the tractors from blue and grey to UPS brown on the bottom, with a gold line near the center of the tractor and gray for the upper color. All new vehicles purchased by UPS Freight LTL come painted in these colors as the older Overnite equipment is replaced, while the new tractors for the truckload division (Former Overnite Transportation - Special Services Division) are solid white with the UPS shield on the roof fairing.

International DuraStar UPS Freight Reasons for buyout Prior to the buyout of Overnite, FedEx had recently purchased LTL companies American Freightways (on the east coast) and Viking Freight (on the west coast), creating FedEx Freight. UPS spokesman Norman Black told industry news outlet FleetOwner that the LTL industry had become attractive due to the increasing economic and strategic attractiveness of the sector: “[LTL has become] attractive because of consolidations and watching the survivors grow and flourish as they’ve been improving operating ratios and developing new types of services customers respond to - especially in time-definite delivery options...

It is an Open educational resources project focusing on reaching university students mainly in developing countries, where textbooks are often expensive and not affordable. Textbooks are necessary and crucial for higher education, but they are becoming increasingly expensive, even in the United States. Between 1998 and 2014 textbook prices increased by 161 percent.Triaging Textbook Costs Inside Higher Ed.

Retrieved 2015-08-17  History  The Global Text Project was initiated in 2006 by Professors Don McCubbrey of the Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver and Rick Watson of the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia. In 2007 the organization received funding from the Jacobs Foundation of Switzerland to move forward with a pilot test of the project. The project's original intention was to share open- content textbooks in English, Arabic, Chinese, and Spanish freely via the Global Text website. Currently, the website has over 100 textbooks primarily available in English, but many in Spanish and Chinese as well. Translations are also underway into Arabic and Dari.  Methodology  This project relies heavily on volunteers; however, the organization has found it challenging to engage volunteer translators in languages other than Spanish. Volunteers are currently enrolled as college or graduate students, and are bilingual to some extent. Other volunteers come from volunteer translator communities such as Translations for Progress and Translators Without Borders. Once a book has been chosen for translation based on global needs and availability of volunteer translators, work is allocated to a virtual team of translators using a Pyramid method. =The Pyramid Method= The Global Text Project developed this translation methodology to foster collaboration among student and other translators and engage them in the translation process. The Pyramid Method involves the following three steps: #The book to be translated is broken down into small segments for volunteers to translate, generally around 5 pages for novices. #Volunteers with a higher level proficiency review two or more segments and then pass several segments on for review by more experienced translators. #Finally, the entire book is reviewed by a professional with domain knowledge and who is fluently bilingual. The book is then published on the Global Text website.

Career Lee Deok- hwa studied theater and film at Dongguk University, and made his acting debut in 1972. He and his father, movie star Lee Ye-chun starred together in the 1975 horror film The Man with Two Faces. In 1976, Lee and actress Im Ye-jin starred in Never Forget Me and I Am Really Sorry, both movies in the \\"Really Really\\" series that dealt with teenagers' aspirations and romance. They were box office hits, and hugely popular among high school students of that generation. Lee had previously acted opposite Im in Red Shoes (1975) and continued to do so in Blue Classroom (1976), I've Never Felt Like This Before (1976), Angry Apple (1977), When We Grow Up... (1977), The First Snow (1977), The Hey Days of Youth 77 (1979), and Love's Scribble (1988). Lee received acting recognition for his subsequent films, including three Best Actor awards from the Grand Bell Awards for Lost Love (also known as In the Name of Memory, 1989), Fly High Run Far (1991), and I Will Survive (1993). Lee also became the first Korean actor to win an award at an international film festival in 1993 when he was chosen as Best Actor at the Moscow International Film Festival for I Will Survive. On the small screen, Lee won the prestigious Daesang (or \\"Grand Prize\\") for the contemporary drama Love and Ambition (1987) and period epic Han Myung-hoe (1994). The latter is among the many real-life historical figures that Lee has played in his prolific career, including Joseon prime minister Han Myung-hoe in Han Myung-hoe (1994), Goryeo military dictator Yi Ui-min in Age of Warriors (2003), Tang Dynasty general Xue Rengui in Dae Jo Yeong (2006), Goryeo military commander Gang Gam-chan in Empress Cheonchu (2009), and King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo in The King of Legend (2010). In 2005, Lee played Chun Doo-hwan in the television drama 5th Republic, in an ongoing series on MBC about modern Korean political history. The Fifth Republic stands for the period that Chun was in power as president, depicting how he assumed power through a military coup and was forced to resign after a series of democratic movements. The drama was controversial and provoked mixed reactions. Some viewers complained that Lee's charismatic turn as Chun was an attempt to beautify or whitewash the image of the dictator, whereas former aides of Chun accused MBC of distorting history. Later that year, Lee was reported to be the second top earner among all actors and entertainers who appeared on the KBS network in 2004, with total earnings of . He reunited with Dae Jo Yeong writer Jang Young-chul in 2010 hit drama Giant, set during the economic boom of 1970-80s Korea. He again joined Jang's follow-up along with former co-star Lee Beom-soo in the 2012 drama History of a Salaryman. The series is set upon a quirky comedy and satire of China's Chu–Han Contention against the backdrop of the pharmaceutical industry, industrial espionage, and office politics. In 2013, Lee received glowing reviews for his turn as King Injo in the period drama Blooded Palace: The War of Flowers, shown on cable channel jTBC. At a press conference prior to airing, Lee said, \\"Injo is a king who acceded to the throne due to revolutionary force. He had no philosophy of his own and was just a puppet king. It is more interesting for me to portray a king that we are unfamiliar with.\\" Lee also hosts variety shows, notably the Korean version of Dancing with the Stars for the past three seasons. Other activities Lee was president of the Korea Film Actors Association in 1995, and its chairman from 2009 to 2010. He also served as festival director for the Chungmuro International Film Festival in Seoul (CHFFIS) from 2008 to 2009. Lee ran for Congress in 1996 under the conservative New Korea Party, predecessor of the Grand National Party, but was defeated. He actively campaigned for Lee Myung-bak during the 2007 primaries and presidential election, making speeches at sorties and taking an advisory post for the team's art and culture policy. In 2009, Lee, Cho Jae-hyun, Choi Soo-jong, Sol Kyung-gu, Kim Hye-soo, Ahn Sung-ki and Park Joong-hoon each taught a master class in acting at the Im Kwon-taek Film and Art College of Dongseo University. All of them then waived their lecturing fees and donated the entire amount to scholarships for young actors. Lee said he willingly accepted the request to teach because he wanted to contribute to training talented film experts for the future of the Korean film industry, and that he was happy to donate his fee to that cause. Personal life Lee's father is actor (1919–1977). His daughter is also an actress.

During his 39 years at the Norwegian TV network, NRK, he produced numerous comedy television series. After his death he was widely hailed by his colleagues as possibly the greatest Norwegian TV comedian in history. He was the son of NRK journalist and television host Rolf Kirkvaag. Life Trond Kirkvaag appeared on television for the first time in 1968 in an NRK 1 program titled “Smil til det skjulte kamera” (Smile to the hidden camera), which was originally broadcast on 7 October 1967. This was the first step into a long- standing professional relationship with NRK, and Kirkvaag became a firm fixture in the national TV and radio corporation's identity.NRK Nett TV: «Nekrolog over Trond Kirkvaag ved Lisa Strindberg» (Obituary of T. Kirkvaag, by L. Strindberg) — video report. Trond Kirkvaag was best known for his work with Knut Lystad and Lars Mjøen as part of the comedy trio KLM, (KLM: Trond Kirkvaag parodying [fellow] Dan Børge Akerø). which was inspired by such diverse influences as the absurd humour of Monty Python; the nonsensical, wordy Blackadder; Not the Nine O'Clock News; the childlike mime-esque Mr. Bean, made famous by Rowan Atkinson; and even the slapstick of the silent movie era and the quick-fire wise-cracking of the Marx Brothers. Kirkvaag and his fellow comedians won the Gullrute (Golden Pane) television award in 2004. The award is given by fellow members of the acting profession, and is an indication of how well-respected he was among his colleagues. KLM won another Gullrute in 2007; however, only Lystad and Mjøen were able to receive the award, as Kirkvaag was too ill to attend.Dagbladet, 6 June 2007: «Trond Kirkvaag alvorlig kreftsyk» (Trond Kirkvaag seriously ill with cancer). Lystad paid an emotional tribute to his long-time friend during his acceptance speech. Career He began working at NRK in 1968. One of his first successes was “Buffalo Bløffs internasjonale vegg-til-vegg-show” (The Buffalo Bluff Wall-to-Wall International Tour) in 1973, made with partner Jon Skolmen. It won the Chaplin Award in Montreux. In 1976, he and Skolmen won the Golden Rose of Montreux, the Chaplin Award and the Press Award in Montreux for “The Nor- way to Broadcasting”, a humorous program about the history of broadcasting in Norway. He began his collaboration with Lystad and Mjøen in 1976 with the satirical news program, Nynytt (Newnews). In 1979, KLM wrote and starred in the first of four series about Brødrene Dal (The Dal Brothers), which continued to be produced until 2005.IMDb: Trond Kirkvaag's Filmography. KLM also created a live show, Brødrene Dal - Vikingsverdets forbannelse (The Brothers Dal - Curse of the Viking Sword) in 1997 and released an LP album featuring songs from the show. A fifth series of “Brødrene Dal” was planned, but abandoned after Kirkvaag's death. Other programs included MRK Fjærsynet (MRK TeeVee) - an ironic play on NRK's title, with the acronym being an abbreviation of “Morsk Rikskringkasting” (Hard and Fast National Broadcasting Corporation). Fjærsyn is a colloquial pronunciation of “fjernsyn” (TV), Skai TV - imitert fjernsyn” (Skai Ⓡ TV Not to be confused with the Greek Skai TV (ΣΚΑΪ Τηλεόραση) channel, set up five years later…An Imitated Television (Channel); 1988), KLMs Nachspiel (KLM's After Play; 1992) and “KLMs Vorspiel” (KLM's Prelude), the Montreux live contributions, “Diplomatix” (1985), and The Rise and Fall of an Olympic Village (1994), as well as the film Noe Helt Annet (Something Completely Different). In 1996, Kirkvaag created the program Trotto Libre on NRK 1's Alltid Moro (Always Fun), with fellow comedian Otto Jespersen. After the collaboration with Jespersen ended, he starred in a skit series “Showtalk”, with short satirical sketches on a TV2 talk show.«Ubetalelig morsomme klipp», nrk.no; accessed 5 March 2018. Death On 16 November 2007, Trond Kirkvaag died aged 61 of colorectal cancer. He was cremated on 30 November.NRK: «Trond Kirkvaag ble bisatt fredag» (Trond Kirkvaag cremated Friday) His final TV appearance was on “Luftens Helter”, which he co-wrote with Knut Lystad. The final episode was aired the day after his death. Bibliography Kirkvaag wrote two books: the crime novel “Kongen” (The King), and the autobiography “Kom ikke nærmere. Jeg og far” (Come no closer. Me and Dad), in which he described what it was like growing up in the 1950s in Majorstuen (a part of the Frogner borough in Oslo), in the shadow of his father, the most famous Norwegian TV entertainer of his time,«Alt om hans far» All about his father , dagsavisen.no; accessed 5 March 2017.NRK, 17 November 2007: «Trond Kirkvaag er død» (Trond Kirkvaag died). then nicknamed Sjonkel Rolf by the children who watched his shows. In Come no closer,“Kom ikke nærmere” (Published by NRK aktivum Forlag, 2007, 270 pages, ). Kirkvaag describes his father as being a kind of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, both at home and at work,«Minner uten filter» Unfiltered Memories , Aftenposten, 1 August 2007. prone to severely punishing his children when they broke his rules, sometimes beating them,«Slått av far han fryktet» Beaten by the father he feared, VG, 18 July 2007. «Kirkvaag slått av far» Kirkvaag beaten by his father, Se og Hør, 18 July 2007. although their sister was always spared from such harsh treatment. Kirkvaag wrote that he and his brother were so frightened they used to call him \\"the stranger\\". Kirkvaag's uncle, Tor Kirkvaag (born 1929; Rolf Kirkvaag Sr's younger brother) denied these and other allegations.Se og Hør, 19 July 2007: «Lillebror Kirkvaag raser» (Lil' brother Kirkvaag enraged). Trond Kirkvaag's younger brother Rolf Jr. (born 1948) was as adamant as his uncle; he firmly denied the things his brother wrote;«-Kirkvaag var en god far» «Kirkgaard was a good father», Se og Hør, 18 July 2007. however, he admitted that same day that he and his elder brother had been mistreated by their father.«- Jeg valgte ris på rumpa framfor husarrest» I chose to be spanked rather than be prohibited from going out, VG, 18 July 2007. Trond claimed that he tried to reconcile his differences with his father before he died in 2003, without success.

The station has transmitted several Restricted Service Licence 28-day broadcasts and on 20 December 2007 was awarded a five-year community radio licence for the area. The station then began permanent broadcasting on 10 January 2009 on the frequency of 101.8 FM. History The concept for Vixen came from a local Market Weighton born and bred man, Paul Stellings. By the start of 2002, Stellings had 18 years broadcasting and management experience with Radio Medica, a local hospital radio station. This, together with his involvement with other radio projects in the area, and his work with the Giant Bradley Festival Committee in Market Weighton, led him to thinking that it would be good for the area to set up a temporary radio station to promote the Giant Bradley Festival and Market Weighton's local businesses, and offer local information. Another part of the plan was to provide a very wide music policy, including music from as far back as the 1940s and 1950s, together with specialist music programmes, rarely catered for by other broadcasters. At that time, Market Weighton and the surrounding villages were in the middle of a government-funded regeneration project initiated through Yorkshire Forward, and managed by the, Weighton Area Regeneration Partnership (WARP). With many ideas and new projects starting to take shape in the area, it seemed like a good time and a major step forward in this new dawning era for the area to bring a truly local radio service to the population. So it was in January 2002 that Stellings started the process of setting up Vixen 87, with the target of the first month-long broadcast commencing in May 2003. Setting up a high quality, professional-sounding new radio station from scratch is a mammoth and expensive task. Sixteen months was calculated as being a realistic timescale to set up Vixen 87. After initially obtaining help from the Council For Voluntary Service (CVS) in Beverley, Stellings called upon a couple of experienced colleagues from Hospital Radio, and some members of the local Chamber of Trade, for their collective expertise in broadcasting and operating businesses. The group formed a committee, and drew up an official constitution to create the organisation, Market Weighton Community Radio, which would broadcast under the call sign Vixen 87. After over a year of working with potential grant funders, recruiting volunteers, purchasing equipment, finding premises for the station and a transmitter site, building studios, working through a multitude of officialdom with many bodies, including The Radio Authority (now OFCOM), The Performing Rights Society, Phonographic Performance Ltd, The Mechanical Copyright Society and many others, the station launched on target at 8 minutes to 7 a.m. on Sunday, 4 May 2003. That time of day was chosen to coincide with the first part of the station's frequency of 87.9 FM, with a national news bulletin at 7:00 a.m. followed by the breakfast show at 7:03 a.m., presented by the founder himself, starting off with the track \\"Inner Smile\\" by the pop group Texas. In May 2011, Vixen 101 presenters Bill Horncastle and Dave Henderson set a new world record by presenting a 53-hour- long radio show, beating the record set by Chris Moyles of Radio 1 by one hour. The record is still subject to final confirmation by Guinness.

In the revolutionary year 1848, many of Prague's bourgeoisie decided to flee the city. Many of them fled by train. In those times, there was only one railway line that connected Prague with Vienna, by way of Česká Třebová and Olomouc, and Běchovice was the first station beyond Prague. Because of its location, General Windischgraetz chose Běchovice as a main center for searches for rebels. Windischgraetz and his army searched each train, but they were not able to find any guns or rebels. Soon after 6 a.m., a train arrived full of students fleeing from Prague. It is not known what exactly happened. There was probably a minor skirmish between one of the passengers and some soldiers, but it grew to a massacre. Hussars attacked the train and slaughtered everyone on sight. Everyone was ordered to stay on the train, but the hussars pulled people out and killed them. Some of the passengers, mainly women and children, fled to the nearby train station building although it was under heavy fire. The exact number of those killed is not known, but there were over 100 heavily wounded passengers.

The current officers include the Rev. Ammi Irako Andriamahazosoa, President; the Rev. Jean Louis Zarazaka, Clerical Vice President; Mr. Georges Randriamamonjisoa, Lay Vice President; Mr. Olivier Andrianarivelo, Treasurer, and the Rev. Zaka Andriamampianina and Mr. Benjamin Rakotomandimby, Advisors.  History  Founded in 1968 as a Reformed Protestant denomination by the union of three churches that arose from the work of the London Missionary Society, the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society and the Friends Foreign Missionary Association, the FJKM today has more than 6 million adherents in more than 7,200 congregations and 37 Synods nationwide and 1 international synod; the church runs 581 schools. It is a growing church, having planted on average one new church a week for the past ten years. However, there are currently only about 1500 ordained clergy (of whom about 250 are women), so most ministers are responsible for a number of congregations. They are assisted by an extensive corps of lay pastors and catechists who are able to preach and provide pastoral care. The fact that former Madagascar President Marc Ravalomanana is a member of the church and concurrently served as an elected lay vice-president of the church during his presidential term has led to concerns of church and state interests being \\"not kept entirely separate\\" in Madagascar.U.S. Department of State, \\"International Religious Freedom Report 2006: Madagascar\\" . In 2002, a schism in the church occurred, and the New Protestant Church in Madagascar was formed with 300,000 former members of the FJKM. Following the 2009 Malagasy protests, the leader of the FJKM, Pastor Lala Rasendrahasina, was taken into custody by army soldiers along with five generals who were selected by Ravalomanana as members of a proposed military directorate that would have run the executive branch after his resignation but instead had transferred power over to the opposition leader, Andry Rajoelina, (a Roman Catholic); Rasendrahasina, a cousin of Ravalomanana's wife and supporter of Ravalomanana, was seen as being too close to the former president.  General Synod  FJKM’s highest policy-making is the General Synod (Synoda Lehibe), which is composed of nearly 400 delegates & alternates from the church’s 38 Synods. The General Synod meets once every four years and it elects the National Council.  National Council  The 100-member National Council (Mpiandraikitra Foibe) meets twice yearly, usually in April and October. It is made up of 50 clergy and 50 lay people, including: 3 clergy representing the seminaries, 19 clergy representing the synods, 7 teachers, and 19 lay people representing the synods. A small number of alternates are also elected in each category to fill any vacancies. The National Council has two permanent advisory committees: one for the Care of the Laity (Filan-kevitra momba ny Fandraminana Fiangonana or FIFAFI) and the other for Care of the Clergy (Filan-kevitra momba ny Fandraminana Mpitandrina or FIFAMPI).  Church Officers  The National Council elects officers of the church from among its members: the President (Filoha), two Vice Presidents (Filoha mpanampy) – one clergy, one lay – a Treasurer (Mpitahirivola), and two Advisors (Mpanolotsaina – also one clergy, one lay). With the National Council’s approval, the President appoints a Secretary General (Sekretera Jeneraly) to manage the day-to-day affairs of the church. The officers of the church (Biraon’ny Mpiandraikitra Foibe) meet weekly as an executive committee to oversee the running of the church with the Secretary General serving on that committee in an ex officio capacity.  Structure  The national office (foibe) of FJKM houses three main divisions: the Department of Churches (Departemantan’ny Fiangonana or DF), the Department of Schools (Departemantan’ny Sekoly or DS) and the Department of Human Resources and Finance (Departemantan’ny Mpiasa sy Vola or DMV). The Department of Churches is the largest of the departments. Its work includes the administration and development of: 1\\\\. FJKM theological institutions: the Faculty of Theology at the Reformed University of Madagascar (which also offers a Masters program) and three seminaries at Fianarantsoa, Ivato (Antananarivo) and Mandritsara, plus a new one in development at Ambatondrazaka; 2\\\\. The eight branches (sampana) of the church: Women (Dorkasy), Men (SLK), Youth (STK), Laity (SFL, including the Lay Training School, SEFALA), Sunday School (Sekoly Alahady), Boy and Girl Scouts (SAMPATI), Blue Cross (Vokovoko Manga, which fights drug and alcohol abuse), and Revival (SAFIF, which includes the network of spiritual healing and retreat centres); 3\\\\. Two services (sampanasa) of the church: the Evangelism Department (AFF) and the Theological Research and Formation Department (FFP); and 4\\\\. The work (asa) of the church, including such diverse initiatives as TOPAZA orphanage, an order of nuns (Mamre), social workers and a chaplaincy program. The Department of Schools oversees FJKM’s extensive network of about 720 schools around the country serving more than 100,000 students. About 80% of these are primary schools; the rest are middle or high schools. The Department of Schools also operates a Teacher Training College that is being incorporated into the newly established Reformed University of Madagascar, which it is working to develop. The Department of Finance and Human Resources oversees the day-to-day administration of the church, including personnel and fiscal issues. It also oversees a cheese- making business (FIVATSY), a printing press, a bookstore, and the FJKM property unit (FIFA). FJKM also has a number of permanent committees, such as the church-wide committee to fight HIV and AIDS (KPMS) and the committee on the Life of the Nation that advises church leaders on issues of national governance and reconciliation. The Secretary General also oversees several structures. These include the communications unit (AFIFAB) which administers the church’s print and broadcast media; the Fruits, Vegetables, and Environmental Education Project (MFEE); and the FJKM Development Department (SAF). SAF was started in 1974 and has 58 units, about half of which are medical clinics, spread throughout much of the country. SAF has programs in Community Health (clinics, family planning, prevention of malaria, TB and HIV, etc.), Food Security and Nutrition, Environmental Management (environmental education, reforestation, protection of indigenous vegetation, development of new fruit trees), Water and Sanitation, and Disaster Risk Reduction and Management. It has its own board of directors and has formal nongovernmental organization (NGO) status.  Ecumenical Partnerships  Roughly half of Madagascar’s population is Christian. There is a small but significant (7%) Muslim presence, but the bulk of non-Christians practice traditional beliefs that include the veneration of ancestors. FJKM works together with other Christian churches in ecumenical bodies such as the Christian Council of Churches in Madagascar (Fikambanan’ny Fiangonana Kristiana Malagasy or FFKM), which it helped found in 1980. It also has a long history of partnership with the Lutheran Church through the Federation of Protestant Churches in Madagascar (Fiombonan’ny Fiangonana Protestanta Malagasy or FFPM), which operates a number of joint projects, including several schools, Akany Fifampandrosoana and the Akany Avoko Children’s Home. FJKM maintains close ties with the successor bodies to the three mission societies of its heritage: the Council for World Mission (CWM) , the Evangelical Community for Apostolic Action (Communauté Evangélique d’Action Apostolique or CEVAA) and Quaker Peace and Service.

The book traces the folkloric origins of the African-American cultural practice of \\"signifying\\" and uses the concept of signifyin(g) to analyze the interplay between texts of prominent African- American writers, specifically Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston and Ishmael Reed. Gates' title alludes to the song \\"Signifyin' Monkey\\" by Oscar Brown, recorded in 1960.  Literary signifying  Signifyin(g) is closely related to double-talk and trickery of the type used by the Monkey of these narratives, but, as Gates himself admits, \\"It is difficult to arrive at a consensus of definitions of signifyin(g).\\"Gates, Henry Louis. African American Literary Criticism, 1773 to 2000, ed. Hazel Arnett Ervin. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1999. 261. Bernard W. Bell defines it as an \\"elaborate, indirect form of goading or insult generally making use of profanity\\".Bell, Bernard W. The Afro-American Novel and Its Traditions. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1987. 22. Roger D. Abrahams writes that to signify is \\"to imply, goad, beg, boast by indirect verbal or gestural means\\".Abrahams, Roger D. African American Literary Criticism, 1773 to 2000, ed. Hazel Arnett Ervin. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1999. 260. Signifyin(g) is a homonym with the concept of signification put forth by Semiotician Ferdinand de Saussure wherein the signifier (sound image) interacts with the signified (concept) to form one whole linguistic sign.Saussure, Ferdinand de. \\"Course In General Linguistics\\", Structuralism, Linguistics, Narratology. eds. Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan. 66. Gates plays off this homonym and incorporates the linguistic concept of signifier and signified with the vernacular concept of signifyin(g). Gates defines two main types of literary Signifyin(g): oppositional (or motivated) and cooperative (or unmotivated). Unmotivated signifyin(g) takes the form of the repetition and alteration of another text, which \\"encode admiration and respect\\" and are evidence \\"not the absence of a profound intention but the absence of a negative critique\\". Gates more thoroughly focuses on oppositional or motivated Signifyin(g) and how it \\"functions as a metaphor for formal revision, or intertextuality, within the Afro-American literary tradition\\". Authors reuse motifs from previous works but alter them and \\"signify\\" upon them so as to create their own meanings. Ralph Ellison revises or \\"signifies\\" upon Richard Wright's work just as Ishmael Reed goes on to signify upon both authors' work and so forth.Gates, Henry Louis. \\"The Blackness of Blackness: A Critique on the Sign and the Signifying Monkey\\", Literary Theory: An Anthology. Eds. Julie Rivkin & Michael Ryan. 992.  Critical reception  On publication in 1988, The Signifying Monkey received both widespread praise and notoriety. The prominent literary critic Houston A. Baker wrote that it was \\"a significant move forward in Afro- American literary study\\"Baker, Houston A. Blues, Ideology, and Afro-American Literature: A Vernacular Theory. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984. 111. and Andrew Delbanco wrote that it put Gates \\"at the forefront of the most significant reappraisal of African-American critical thought since the 1960s\\".Delbanco, Andrew. \\"Talking Texts\\", Black Literature Criticism Supplement, eds. Jeffrey W. Hunter and Jerry Moore. Detroit: Gale, 1999. 142. It won an American Book Award in 1989. However, it was also closely scrutinized to the point of \\"being more talked about than read, more excoriated than understood\\".Lubiano, Wahneema. \\"Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and African-American Literary Discourse\\", Black Literature Criticism Supplement, eds. Jeffrey W. Hunter and Jerry Moore. Detroit: Gale, 1999. 147. Complaints against it include that Gates's focus is exclusively Afrocentric, that he presupposes the signifying tradition and then fits his evidence to conform to the tradition, and that he is guilty of circular logic.Myers, D. G. \\"Signifying Nothing\\", New Criterion 8 (1990): 63. Nonetheless, The Signifying Monkey has helped contribute to the reputation of Gates as being, along with Houston Baker, one of the two most important African-American literary theorists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.Mason, Theodore O. \\"African American Theory and Criticism: 2. 1977 to 1990\\".

He also founded Pacific Global Management Group (PGM), the holding company that controls the Elite World network of modeling agencies,) and owned luxury Italian lingerie brand La Perla. which Was sold in February 2018 to Sapinda Holding Biography =Early career= After graduating in 1983 with a degree in Electronic Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Turin, Scaglia began working at Aeritalia Spazio, where for a time he worked on the Teleret satellite project in partnership with NASA and Martin Marietta. Later, in response to a job advertisement, he applied to Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting, where he worked for three years, first as a programmer and then as a consultant. On the verge of pursuing a master's degree in the U.S., Scaglia instead accepted a position at McKinsey & Co., where he worked under Gianfilippo Cuneo for three years, ultimately following him to Bain & Company. There, among other roles, Scaglia was a consultant for Piaggio. At the start of the 1990s, he became logistics manager for Piaggio's Spanish subsidiary, working alongside Giovanni Agnelli. Subsequently, he became director of Piaggio's foreign licensing partners, and founded Piaggio's first industrial base in China in 1994 in Foshan with Agnelli. =Omnitel= In 1994, Omnitel Pronto Italia obtained a mobile telephone license that allowed it to compete with Telecom Italia Mobile. In 1995, as he prepared to move to Singapore with his family, Scaglia received an offer to work for the Omnitel Pronto Italia “start-up,” which by then had become Telecom Italia's top competitor in mobile phones; it is now known as Vodafone. A few months later, in mid-1996 – after Francesco Caio left Omnitel, having been scouted by Franco De Benedetti to run Olivetti – Scaglia took over Caio's role as chief executive officer of Omnitel, a position he held until 1999 (when Olivetti sold Omnitel, and Scaglia left the company to found Fastweb). =Fastweb= In July 1999, Scaglia created e.Biscom – parent company to several firms, including Fastweb – together with several other executive and financier Francesco Micheli. On March 30, 2000, e.Biscom made a formal request to Consob, the Italian Securities and Exchange Commission, for stock market flotation. At the peak of the new economy bubble, individual shares of the company were sold for 160 €. The funds raised through Fastweb's stock exchange flotation allowed it to make numerous investments. Fastweb was the first company in the world to develop a network entirely based on Internet Protocol (IP) – a system that moves digitalized telephonic communications through routers rather than through traditional telephone exchanges – and also the first company in the world to develop a public network using fiber optics for end consumers. In 2001, Forbes put Silvio Scaglia on the cover of its January issue, a tribute to Fastweb's rapid ascent in the world of technology. In 2003, Time included Scaglia in its list of most influential innovators in the new technology sector. He was the only Italian listed among the so-called “tech survivors,” a group of about 15 tech gurus who made it out of the new economy bubble unscathed. In December 2004 the merger between Fastweb and its parent company e.Biscom was completed; the new company was named Fastweb. On March 12, 2007, the Swiss telephone company Swisscom launched an amicable takeover bid for the Fastweb shares in circulation, at a price of 47 euros per share. On 10 April 2007 Scaglia, Fastweb's majority shareholder, sold his shares in the company, equivalent to 18.7% of the company's share capital. Scaglia remained in the company as administrator of the Board of Directors. On May 15, 2007, Swisscom's takeover bid for Fastweb closed with 64,141,464 shares delivered (82.09% of the capital targeted by the bid). On June 19, 2007, Scaglia left his executive position at Fastweb: his position as Chairman was filled by Carsten Schloter. =Babelgum= On March 5, 2007, Scaglia founded Babelgum, an interactive web TV offering free, high definition video content on demand. He described it as “a kind of professional alternative to YouTube.” The platform operates on a revenue sharing system. In 2012, Babelgum went into liquidation. =Elite World= In February 2011, PGM acquired a majority stake in Elite World. Founded in 1972 in Paris, Elite is the world's largest international network of model management agencies. Elite's agencies and licensing partners are key players in fashion capitals Paris, London, Milan and New York, as well as in cities central to scouting and business development, such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Prague, Bratislava, Copenhagen and Hong Kong. In the years immediately following its acquisition by PGM, Elite World saw a significant boost in its business: with a new focus on digital marketing strategies and strategic acquisitions, the company was well- positioned for growth. It was the first international modeling agency to open a Chinese office, in Shanghai in 2012. After the 2013 opening in New York of The Society Management, and the acquisition Women Management's New York and Paris agencies the same year, today, PGM Group is a leader in the model management business. Elite is also very active in model scouting. Through its well-established Elite Model Look competition, since 1983 the firm has launched the careers of some of the industry's most famous and successful models. =La Perla= On June 4, 2013, Scaglia's SMS Finance firm won a bid to acquire well-known Bologna-based lingerie and ready-to-wear fashion brand La Perla (La Perla (clothing)). At the Civil Court of Bologna, Scaglia won the bid with an offer of 69 million euros, beating out offers from Calzedonia and the Israeli Delta Galil Industries. The La Perla deal brought Scaglia back to the forefront of Italian business world. In an interview with daily La Repubblica, just hours after the acquisition was finalized, he said: “We are not a fund, I am an entrepreneur.” With these words, he intended to quash the doubts some had raised over the genuineness of his interest in supporting La Perla. “After Omnitel and Fastweb I will personally give La Perla my all: for me, this is a personal challenge I am firmly committed to,” he said. Under Scaglia's leadership, La Perla quickly underwent a significant brand repositioning and worldwide development initiative. =Legal Problems= Scaglia faced several legal charges between 2007 and 2013. He was ultimately found innocent of all charges and uninvolved in the matters brought before the courts. Fastweb investigation On March 13, 2007, Scaglia was questioned for the first time, as former CEO of Fastweb, by Roman magistrates who had been investigating him since 2004 for international tax fraud said to have taken place between 2003 and 2006. On April 13, 2007, the public prosecutor moved to dismiss the charges against Scaglia. The case was dismissed by the judge overseeing preliminary investigations on May 22, 2007. Fastweb investigation - Telecom Italia Sparkle As former CEO of Fastweb, Scaglia was under investigation for the crime of “conspiracy to commit tax fraud” in the Fastweb-Telecom Italia Sparkle investigation. He and other Fastweb executives were accused of making false declarations through the use of invoices for non- existent telephonic and telematics transactions. The alleged crimes were said to have occurred between 2005-2006 and concerned ostensible VAT evasion regarding activities by various paid service operators which used the Fastweb and Telecom Italia Sparkle networks. On February 23, 2010, the Rome judge overseeing preliminary investigations issued a preventive detention order for Scaglia, among others, in response to a request by the anti-mafia public prosecutor's office. Through his lawyers, Scaglia agreed to come in for questioning, and he returned to Italy in the night between February 25 and 26, 2010, on a private flight from the Antilles On November 23, 2010, the trial began. On February 24, 2011, after nearly a year of preventive detention, Scaglia was released on the order of judges of the First Penal Section of the Court of Rome. On October 17, 2013, the same court issued a sentence acquitting Scaglia of all charges and establishing his “complete non- involvement in the matter.”. On September 27, 2017, Rome's Court of Appeal upholds the acquittal of Silvio Scaglia in agreement with the 2013 verdict of the First Penal Section of the Court of Rome. = Public award = On 27 October 2013, Scaglia's judicial ordeal has been cited by Mr. Matteo Renzi at the Leopolda meeting in FlorenceThe focus on the defendant's guarantees, \\"in our country, has deep roots and good arguments, long before at the Leopolda the story of Silvio Scaglia was reminded\\": as an injustice that should no longer occur. = Yewno = In 2016, through his Pacific Capital investment fund, Scaglia invested in Yewno, the “discovery platform” developed by Ruggero Gramatica through contributions from Stanford University. In June 2016, Startupitalia wrote that “Yewno has offices in London and Silicon Valley and is composed of a group of entrepreneurs, engineers and data scientists. The team is set to expand thanks to funding from Pacific Capital. The investment firm headed by Silvio Scaglia has assets worth more than 800 million euros and focuses largely on long-term goals.” Scaglia claimed to be “enthusiastic” about Yewno and said he felt “lucky to be a part of it.” Having invested more than 10 million euros in Yewno, Scaglia expressed even greater conviction in the company's potential. “We believe in this team and we are eager to support its efforts ahead of its launch,” he said, adding that Yewno “is taking giant steps toward surpassing today’s research systems.” References Category:1958 births Category:Italian businesspeople Category:Living people Category:McKinsey & Company people Category:People from Milan ","title":"Silvio Scaglia"},{"id":"13691565","text":"Within Modern Orthodox Judaism, the Union of Orthodox Congregations created the National Conference of Synagogue Youth (NCSY) to reach Jewish teenagers in public schools.

He also attracted a reputation as one of the finest Silesian poets of the early Renaissance and as an important agent for cultural and religious change in his adopted home of Breslau (now Wrocław). Laurentius Corvinus was born as Laurentius Rabe in Neumarkt (now Środa Śląska) in Lower Silesia, about 30 km east of Legnica west of Vrotzuav, son of Barthel Rabe, a furrier and member of the local council. As a student at Kraków, he Latinized his name, possibly under the influence of Conrad Celtis, and became known as Corvinus (a Latin translation of his German name Rabe, or raven). After receiving his M.A. at the University of Kraków, Corvinus lectured on \\"De ente et essentia\\" (1492) and Aristotle's Libri Posteriorum (1493); the young Nicolaus Copernicus was probably one of his students during this time.Ludwik Antoni Birkenmajer, Stromata Copernicana: Studja, poszukiwania i materjały biograficzne (Kraków: Nakładem Polskiej Akademji Umiejętności, 1924), pp. 56-79, 119-20, 140-1. Corvinus later helped to publish Copernicus' Latin translation of the Letters of the Byzantine Greek poet Theophylactus Simocatta by sending Copernicus's translation to the printer Johann Haller in Kraków to be published in 1509. He also supplied the printed edition of Copernicus' translation with two poems, one of which describes the journey of Corvinus and his wife Anna back to Breslau, and also makes reference to Copernicus' interest in astronomy. It is not entirely clear whether or not Corvinus' poem actually refers to Copernicus' heliostatic theory, but in any case it is important as a very early witness for Copernicus' involvement in astronomical speculation.JERZY DOBRZYCKI: NOTES ON COPERNICUS’S EARLY HELIOCENTRISM Bd. 2, S. 0935. Corvinus was also close friend to another Silesian, Johannes Sommerfeld, who also taught at Kraków while Copernicus was there. He was influenced by Conrad Celtis and Copernicus befriended the group of humanists. As a student and later magister at the University of Krakow he was acquainted with astronomy; as magister he lectured at the faculty for several years, including the first years of Copernicus’ studies in Kraków. After leaving Kraków, Corvinus worked as school rector and then city secretary (Stadtschreiber) at Schweidnitz' (now Świdnica) (1494–1497). He then moved to Breslau to work as rector of St Elisabeth's school (1497–1503) and then as one of the senior city secretaries (1503–1506), before moving to a position as city secretary of Toruń (1506–1508).Laurentius Corvinus Thorn Stadtschreiber He and his wife then moved back to Breslau in 1508, where he resumed his position as senior city secretary; they remained in Breslau, living in a house near the Siebenradmühle (near the present site of the university library), for the rest of their lives. Corvinus published humanistic writings and poems, many of them religious and philosophical in nature. He was greatly influenced by the Franciscan spirituality of St Bonaventure and the Neoplatonism of Marsilio Ficino. In the spirit of Italian and German humanists he described his adopted home of Breslau in terms borrowed from classical mythology as the new home of the Muses.Grantley McDonald, ‘Laurentius Corvinus a renesansowe miasto Wrocław’ (‘Laurentius Corvinus and the Renaissance City of Breslau’), in Wrocław Literacki, ed.

He was also involved in the introduction of the Lutheran Reformation to Breslau, and personally took part in Johann Heß's disputation in 1524, where he declaimed a poem celebrating Martin Luther as a hero of religion.Grantley McDonald, ‘Laurentius Corvinus and the Epicurean Luther’, Lutheran Quarterly 22 (2008): 161-76.

KTR continues to own the tracks and rolling stock.  Lines  KTR owns the following two regional railway lines: * Miyafuku Line (in Kyoto Prefecture, 30.4 km) * Miyazu Line (in Kyoto Prefecture and Hyōgo Prefecture, 83.6 km)  History  In 1982, the company was incorporated as for the purpose of the construction and operation of the Miyafuku Line, the construction of which was suspended due to financial difficulties of the Japanese National Railways (JNR). The Miyafuku Line was completed in 1988. In the same year, local governments selected the company as the operator of the existing Miyazu Line, which was to be separated from West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in 1990. Following the downturn in the business, investors including the Kyoto Prefecture government decided to introduce a new scheme of business, in which a separate company would operate trains on the tracks of KTR. Willer Group, being the only applicant for this proposal, was selected as the operator and later established Willer Trains Inc.

He first appeared during an episode broadcast on 3 December 2007. Former Brookside actor Sloane was cast as the \\"mysterious\\" hairdresser Niall and was introduced by the series' producer Bryan Kirkwood. During Sloane's portrayal of Niall on- screen, he was central to a storyline involving the already-established McQueen family and it was revealed Niall was the illegitimate son of Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane). The storyline featured Niall seek revenge on the McQueens, which concluded in highly advertised episodes featuring Niall kidnapping his siblings and causing the death of his half-sister Tina Reilly (Leah Hackett). Niall was portrayed by upcoming actor Devon Jackson, the older brother of Hollyoaks actor Kieron Richardson, in flashback scenes depicting Niall's childhood. Niall's other storylines included his relationship with Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). Sloane made his final appearance as Niall during Hollyoaks late-night special series Hollyoaks Later in November 2008. Sloane has been nominated for several awards for his portrayal of the character. Creation and development The character of Niall was first announced in November 2007. Kirkwood discussed Niall in an interview with Digital Spy: \\"A tall stranger who walks into the village — a guy called Niall. He sets himself up as a hair stylist in the salon and he's very ambiguous and mysterious. Viewers will be wondering 'Is he gay? Is he straight? Is he a drugsman?' \\" He would soon be revealed as, \\"the big storyline of 2008 — Myra [McQueen]'s secret and abandoned son is back to wreak revenge on each of the McQueens in turn.\\" Niall's backstory was revealed as his storyline continued through 2008. It was revealed he had been given up by a 14-year-old Myra and abandoned at a church a day after the birth. Niall then spent the rest of his childhood in care. As 2008 progressed, Niall was distracted by his love for Steph Dean (Carley Stenson), but continued to commit a series of violent and manipulative acts against the McQueen family. Barry Sloane said, \\"When I started, Bryan said to me 'you have to come and see me and say if you feel it's going too far'. We've tried as hard as we can to keep him within the bounds of reality. We know that it has to come to an end eventually. I don't know when that's going to be, but fingers crossed that we can ride the wave as long as possible.\\" Niall was also inadvertently responsible for the death of one of Hollyoaks most iconic characters, Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). Sloane said the scenes were some of the \\"best material he's done,\\" and that Niall was full of remorse. He also remarked on the irony of Niall attempting to damage the McQueens, but then killing Max completely by accident. In 2010, Sloane joked that his character could be resurrected after Jamie Lomas' return to the series as his character Warren Fox, despite his death in 2009. Storylines Niall arrives as a new hairdresser at beauty salon, Evissa. He helps Evissa owner Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee) and attacks her fiancé Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas), who assumes Niall is mugging her. Niall befriends co-worker Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna) and her family. Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) is suspicious of Niall, who claims to have two sisters. Niall soon becomes friends with Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane), who is unaware of his identity, and is invited for Christmas. Overwhelmed, Niall steals a picture from the McQueens and burns it. Niall attempts to become closer to his mother and begins encouraging her to be stricter with her youngest daughter, Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes). Niall gets Michaela drunk at a party and injects her with heroin, which causes her to overdose and makes the McQueens believe she is addicted. Niall continues his revenge on the McQueens by ruining their lives in small ways; reporting Myra for benefit fraud, pushing Carmel and boyfriend Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle) apart and attacking his grandmother, Nana McQueen (Diane Langton). Niall grows closer to Steph Dean (Carley Stenson), following her split with boyfriend Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). Niall falls in love with Steph, and is devastated when she and Max get back together and agree to marry. On their wedding day, Niall speeds off in his car, angered that Steph married Max. Unknown to Niall, his car is in the path of Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins). Realising Tom is about to be hit, Max pushes him out the way of the car, but is run over and killed himself. Niall feels guilty for causing Max's death and is pushed away by Steph. Niall reveals an affair between John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) and Kieron Hobbs (Jake Hendriks). Niall overhears Tina Reilly (Leah Hackett) telling Jacqui over the phone she wants to give her unborn child up for adoption. Out of anger, Niall pushes Tina down a flight of stairs, which causes her to have to undergo an emergency hysterectomy and give birth to her son Max prematurely. Jamie \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Sam Darbyshire) witnesses Niall's assault, but due to his drug addiction, Niall convinces everyone that Fletch pushed Tina down the stairs. Niall convinces Kieron to leave John Paul and the village, to get him out of the way. Niall bonds with John Paul in Kieron's absence, but is annoyed when he returns. Kieron tracks down Myra's long-lost son and discovers Niall's secret. After confronting him, Niall admits the truth, but drugs Kieron's beer. Kieron is killed and Niall uses his phone to text John Paul to make him think Kieron committed suicide. Niall later tries to drug John Paul in the same way, but discovers John Paul switched their drinks. John Paul eventually leaves the village with ex-boyfriend Craig Dean (Guy Burnet). Niall's life begins to go wrong after Steph tells him she cannot love him. Niall decides to begin his plot of revenge. He kidnaps each of the McQueen children, leaving notes for Myra, who becomes suspicious after discovering baby Max with a note which mirrors the one she left with a newborn Niall. Niall then confronts Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna) after learning he was the police officer who arrested Niall's biological father, who died in prison. Niall tells Jack the truth and attacks him. Myra tracks her children down to the same church she left Niall in, and is shocked when Niall reveals the truth. Niall tells her she has to answer six questions, and for each she gets wrong, one of her children will be killed. Myra gets two questions correct and is forced to choose between her children. Tina and Michaela are allowed to live. However, Jack, Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson), Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) and Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) arrive to save the McQueens. Realising his plan may be stopped, Niall detonates explosives and the church explodes. In the wreckage, the floor collapses and Niall finds Myra caught under rubble and attempts to free her with help from John Paul. She explains if Niall had told the truth, she would have accepted him. Feeling guilty, Niall pushes Myra out the way as more rubble falls. As the McQueens escape the church, Tina dies from her injuries. As an ambulance drives away, Niall's reflection appears in the window, revealing him to have survived. The McQueens believe Niall is dead. However, the police tell them that Niall's body was never recovered and that he is still alive. Niall arrives back in the village, with the McQueens no longer his target. He follows Steph and Tom to Scotland, where Craig takes them for a break. In the hills, Niall spies on Steph and after a day of waiting, kidnaps Tom. Niall reveals himself and tells Steph he wants to talk. Niall traps Steph on a cliff edge and fights with Craig, who he attempts to kill. However, Craig makes Niall look at a terrified Steph. Realising everything he has done, Niall says goodbye to Steph and falls backwards over the cliff. Several days later, the McQueens are told of Niall's death, but agree not to mourn him. In December 2012, a newborn baby boy is abandoned on the McQueens' doorstep on Christmas Day. After learning that the baby is John Paul's son, he names his son in honour of Niall, but by his real name, Matthew. Reception At the 2008 National Television Awards, Barry Sloane was nominated for the award of 'Most Popular Newcomer' along with three characters from other soaps; Sloane did not win the award for his role as Niall. He was also nominated in the British Soap Awards for 'Sexiest Male' in 2009 and 'Villain of the Year' in 2008 and 2009. In 2009, the church explosion received a nomination for 'Most Spectacular Scene'. In 2009, Virgin Media named Niall as one of British soap's top ten villain in a feature in which he came ninth.

In 1843, he was appointed professor of the principles and practice of medicine and became head of the faculty. In 1854, his title was changed to dean. He died unexpectedly in 1860. Holmes Gold Medal Award In his honour the first Holmes Gold Medal was awarded in 1865. It continues to be awarded annually to the McGill University (Montreal) medical school student who achieves the highest academic standing upon graduation. The Holmes Gold medal is described in the Canada Medical Journal (v. 1; 1865, p 535-536.) as: \\"Since the last convocation, the Medical Faculty in this University determined to establish a gold medal prize to be awarded for superior excellence to a member of the graduating class only.

History Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, 6th leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch branch of Hasidic Judaism, and then his successor, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson were responsible for focusing Chabad's activities on outreach. Each sent out large numbers of rabbinic emissaries, known as \\"Shluchim\\", to settle in places across the world for outreach purposes. The centers that these Shluchim established were termed \\"Chabad houses.\\" Rabbi Schneerson was a pioneer in the field of Orthodox Judaism outreach (Kiruv).

Followers of Chabad can be seen attending to tefillin booths at the Western Wall and Ben Gurion International Airport as well as other public places, and distributing Shabbat candles on Fridays. Chabad rabbis and their families are sent to teach college students, to build day schools, and to create youth camps. Many of these efforts are geared towards secular or less religious Jews. Additionally, unmarried rabbinical students spend weeks during the summer in locations that do not yet have a permanent Chabad presence, making housecalls, putting up mezuzot and teaching about Judaism. This is known as Merkos Shlichus. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson also initiated a Jewish children's movement, called Tzivos Hashem (lit. \\"Army [of] God\\"), for under bar/bat mitzvah-age children, to inspire them to increase in study of Torah and observance of mitzvot. Rabbi Schneerson also encouraged the use of modern technology in outreach efforts such as Mitzva tanks, which are mobile homes that travel a city or country. The Chabad website, chabad.org, a pioneer of Jewish religious outreach on the Internet, was started by Rabbi Yosef Y. Kazen and developed by Rabbi D. Zirkind. In June 1994, Rabbi Schneerson died with no successor.

Operations  Artist's impression of GOES-1 in orbit It was positioned over the Indian Ocean to gather data for the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP). GOES-1 was equipped with a Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR), which provided day and night imagery of terrestrial cloud conditions. It returned its first image on 25 October 1975, nine days after launch. The satellite continuously monitored weather events and relayed this meteorological data from over 10,000 surface locations into a central processing center. The data was then incorporated into weather prediction models. It also carried a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) and a Data Collection System (DCS), derived from those used on TIROS satellites. GOES-1 was replaced by GOES-3, which was launched in 1978. After finishing operations over the Indian Ocean, it was moved to replace SMS-2 over the Pacific Ocean.

Barber was born in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, and studied from the age of 18 at the Royal Academy, London - receiving a silver medal for drawing in 1864, and first exhibiting there in 1866. During his lifetime Barber was regarded as one of Britain's finest animal painters and received commissions from Queen Victoria to do paintings of her with grandchildren and dogs,Queen Victoria portrait to go up for auction and also the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and his pets. A number of his portraits are in the Royal Collection. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1866 to 1893. In 1883 he was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. Barber became a very popular sporting and animal painter, specialising particularly in sentimental portraits of dogs, often with children. His work ranged from photographically realistic to quick sketches. Although some have regarded his work as overly sentimental, his work remains popular, largely because of his competent painting. Barber received his final commission in 1894 to paint Queen Victoria, with her grandchildren, in her pony-carriage. He died in London soon afterwards. His place as foremost painter of children and pets was taken by Arthur Elsley. Many of Barber’s paintings were made into prints, usually in the medium of photogravure. He exhibited at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, Walker Art Gallery and Manchester Art Gallery. Much of his art is at the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight.

The \\"epic metre\\" in traditional Indian poetry is attributed to Valmiki, with verses consisting of memorable rhyming couplets, suggesting that the poem was intended for public recitation, a common Indian oral tradition. On Pargat Diwas, portraits of Valmiki, typically depicted as a monk wearing saffron-coloured robes and holding a quill and paper, are paraded in processions called Shobha Yatra through the main streets of the Balmiki sect's locality, accompanied by street devotional singing.

The name draws on the tradition of Young Poland’s \\"Krytyka\\" (The Critique), a monthly magazine published by Wilhelm Feldman at the beginning of the 20th century, and on the samizdat \\"Krytyka\\" which served as a forum for opposition writers and journalists in the 1970s and 1980s. Stance The aim of Krytyka Polityczna is to revive the tradition of engaged Polish intelligentsia. From the outset the activities of “Krytyka Polityczna” have focused on three main fields: social science, culture and politics to show that the social sciences, the arts and politics differ only in their means of expression, whereas what they have in common is the impact they have on social reality. The fundamental aim of “Krytyka Polityczna” is to prepare and introduce into the public sphere a project of struggle against economic and social exclusion. Another goal is to spread the idea of deep European integration.  Issues  As of 2019, Krytyka Polityczna is published quarterly. The first 23 issues were: * 1 (2002): Intelligentsia – Helpless or Dead? * 2 (2003): Left-wing, Right-wing, Mixing the Language. * 3 (2003): Our Common House. * 4 (2003): Aren’t You a Populist Yet? * 5 (2004): Two-speed Poland. * 6 (2004): Turbulent Times. * 7-8 (2005): Describe the Future, Create the Past. * 9-10 (2005): A Love for Politics. * 11-12 (2007): The Praise of Antagonism. * 13 (2007): Holidays with the Right-wing. * 14 (2008): Only the Truth Can Make Us Free. * 15 (2008): Non-human Politics. * 16-17 (2009): If not Monogamy, then What? * 18 (2009): Go and Watch! (a visual issue) * 19 (2009) Brave New World * 20-21 (2010) The Communist Manifesto * 22 (2010) Violence * 23 (2010) East of Eden REDakcja (REDaction) and Nowy Wspaniały Świat (Brave New World) Community Center In the years 2006-2009 the milieu of the \\"Krytyka Polityczna\\" ran REDakcja (Warsaw, Chmielna 26/19 St.) – a centre serving the exchange of thought, debate, trainings, workshops, expositions of art, and presentation of social and political projects. REDakcja was also a distribution point of alternative and left-wing books and magazines. From its opening REDakcja held several hundred open meetings – literary debates, workshops, seminars, screenings, as well as a few film festivals. REDakcja became one of the most important cultural centers in the capital. In January 2008, it received the most important prize for cultural places: \\"Wdechy 2007\\" in the category: \\"Place of the Year,\\" awarded by the biggest Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. In November 2009, in the very center of Warsaw (at the corner of Świętokrzyska St. and Nowy Świat St.) „Krytyka Polityczna” opened Nowy Wspaniały Świat (Brave New World) Community Center – a place of artistic and academic meetings, film screenings, exhibition space and a cultural café. Multiple events are organized in the center – debates, festivals, discussions – all open to public. Among major projects held in the center are Uniwersytet Krytyczny (Critical University) – open lectures and seminars held by most prominent professors and intellectuals from Poland and abroad, and Wolne Niedziele (Free Sundays) – weekly experimental and avant- garde music concerts. In July 2012, the community center was closed. Krytyka Polityczna Local Clubs Thanks to the activities of the sympathizers and cooperators of the Association in other Polish cities “Krytyka Polityczna” Clubs were created similar to REDakcja – they organize debates, social actions and other public events. By June 2009 22 such clubs have been established: Białystok, Bydgoszcz, Bytom, Cieszyn, Gdańsk, Głogów, Gniezno, Elbląg, Jelenia Góra, Kalisz, Kielce, Kraków, Lublin, Łódź, Opole, Piła, Poznań, Siedlce, Szczecin, Toruń, Włocławek, Wrocław. The Network of Clubs constitutes the first attempt to build solid institutional foundations in order to enhance the commitment and integration of a large group of young people in the name of reviving the ethos of engaged intelligentsia. “Krytyka Polityczna” has opened two common-rooms - in the north (Tricity) and south (Cieszyn) of Poland which operate similarly to former REDakcja organizing multiple artistic and social events. The publishing house of the Political Critique In 2006 The Political Critique, in cooperation with Ha!art, launched a new publishing project - The Political Critique Series. The first issue came out in December 2006. In September 2007 people associated with “Krytyka Polityczna” established its own Krytyka Polityczna Publishing House. The aim is to introduce to the Polish audience the most important works of political philosophy and sociology, theory of culture and arts. The publishing house publishes transtaltions, works of Polish authors and important reissues. Over 70 titles have been published until August 2010 either in one of the eight book series (Readers, Ideas, Canon, Journalistic, Literary, Jacek Kuroń Writings, Historical, Economic) or outside series. Among the authors published by the press are: Louis Althusser, Timothy Garton Ash, Alain Badiou, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Stanisław Brzozowski, Judith Butler, Manuel Castells, Roman Frydman, Bruno Latour, Chantal Mouffe, Marian Pankowski, Jacques Rancière, Nicholas Stern, Artur Żmijewski, Slavoj Žižek.  Website  \\"Krytyka Polityczna\\" website is an independent news provider (among other things, concerning social actions and cultural events), as well as a space for commentary (political analyses, columns, essays, reviews). One can find announcements, reports, photos and audio recordings of various meetings organized by \\"Krytyka Polityczna\\". The website serves also as a forum of opinion and exchange. It serves as an archive of articles, pieces of published books, as well as the content of those journal issues that are no longer available for sale. In September 2007 \\"Krytyka Polityczna\\" launched the tv_kp project – a sort of internet TV medium with filmed commentaries, recordings of discussions, short videos, invitations.

Shortly after beginning his teaching career at MIT Peabody published in 1888 the Tables of Properties of Saturated Steam and Other Vapors and invented the throttling calorimeter. Peabody was ever expanding the course offerings at MIT and in his first year of teaching established courses in Marine Engineering and in 1891 courses in Naval Architecture. The courses led to the development of the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering in 1893. Peabody retired in 1920 from head of the Department of Naval Architecture.

The Academy of Athens (, Akadimía Athinón) is Greece's national academy, and the highest research establishment in the country. It was established in 1926, and operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Education. The Academy's main building is one of the major landmarks of Athens.  History and structure  The organization of the Academy of Athens, whose title hearkens back to the ancient Academy of Plato, was first established on 18 March 1926, and its charter was ratified by the law 4398/1929. This charter, with subsequent amendments, is still valid and governs the Academy's affairs. According to it, the Academy is divided into three Orders: Natural Sciences, Letters and Arts, Moral and Political Sciences. = Research centres= The Academy today, maintains 14 research centres, seven research offices and the \\"Ioannis Sykoutris\\" central library. In 2002, the Foundation for Biomedical Research of the Academy of Athens was established. The Hellenic Institute for Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Studies in Venice also functions under the supervision of the Academy. = Membership in international organizations = From its foundation, the Academy of Athens has been a member of the International Association of Academies (AIA), and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). It also participates in the following body: All European Academies (ALLEA), European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC), Inter Academy Council (IAC), Inter Academy Medical Panel (IAMP).  Main building  Panoramic view Statue of Socrates with the Apollo column in the background (by sculptor Leonidas Drosis). Detail of stone carving (architectural term: Acroterion) of Sphinx on the facade.Interior view The main building of the Academy is a neoclassical building between Panepistimiou Street and Akadimias Street in the centre of Athens. The building was designed as part of an architectural \\"trilogy\\" in 1859 by the Danish architect Theophil Hansen, along with the University and the National Library. Funds had been provided by the magnate Simon Sinas specifically for the purpose, and the foundation stone was laid on 2 August 1859. Construction proceeded rapidly, after 1861 under the supervision of Ernst Ziller, but the internal tumults during the latter years of King Otto's reign, which resulted in his ousting in 1862, hampered construction until it was stopped in 1864. Works resumed in 1868, but the building was not completed until 1885, at a total cost of 2,843,319 gold drachmas, most of it provided by Sinas, and, after his death, by his wife Ifigeneia. The Greek neo-classical sculptor Leonidas Drosis sculpted the principle multi-figure pediment sculpture, on the theme of the birth of Athena, based on a design by painter Carl Rahl. This brought first prize at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873. Drosis is also responsible for the figures of Athena and Apollo with lyre on the Academy's flanking pillars, and the seated marble figures of Plato and Socrates, which were executed \\"by the Italian sculptor Piccarelli\\". The eight smaller pediments in the Academy complex are the terra-cotta work of Austrian sculptor Franz Melnitzky.Neoclassical Architecture in Greece, by Mānos G.

In the absence of a national Academy, the building was used for housing the Numismatic Museum in 1890, and in 1914 the Byzantine Museum and the State Archives. Finally, on 24 March 1926, the building was handed over to the newly established Academy of Athens. = 2004 commemorative coin issue = thumb Front facade at sunset.

In the obverse of the coin, a close view of the building is depicted. The intention was to highlight the premise that in the city of Athena, the Olympic Games should not only be the most important athletic event, but also reflect equal importance toward intellectual and cultural activities. All three should be equivalent to the style and character of the city that was the birthplace and the matrix for the revival of the modern Olympic Games.

A variation of this includes the Huggins Pitch, which produces two white-noise signals that only differ in the interaural phase relation over a narrow range of frequencies. For humans, this phenomenon is restricted to fundamental frequencies lower than 330 Hz and extremely low sound pressure levels. Experts investigate the effects of the dichotic pitch on the brain. For instance, there are studies that suggested it evokes activation at the lateral end of Heschl's gyrus.  Overview  When continuous white noise (with a frequency content below about 2000 Hz) is presented by headphones to the left and right ear of a listener, and given a particular interaural phase relationship between the left and right ear signals, a sensation of pitch (psychophysics) may be observed. Thus, stimulation of either ear alone gives rise to the sensation of white noise only, but stimulation of both ears together produces pitch. Therefore, as a special case of dichotic listening, such a pitch is called dichotic pitch or binaural pitch. Generally, a dichotic pitch is perceived somewhere in the head amidst the noisy sound filling the binaural space. To be more specific, the dichotic pitch is characterized by three perceptual properties: pitch value, timbre, and in-head position (lateralization). Experiments on dichotic pitch were motivated in the context of the study of pitch in general, and of the binaural system in particular, relevant for sound localization and separation of competing sound sources (see cocktail party effect). In the past, various configurations of dichotic pitch were studied and several auditory models were developed. The great challenge for psychophysical and physiological acoustics is to predict both the pitch value and pitch-image position in one model. For more information, references, audio demos etc. see more.  Studies  There have been many findings on the subject of dichotic pitch, showing that different disorders experience it in multiple different ways. Individuals who suffer from dyslexia seem to experience dichotic pitch in a similar way, too if they were trying to distinguish words and letters. Robert F. Dougherty and team, ran an experiment using both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children. The participants were given a melody to listen to and different tones were then played within the melody. The dyslexic children were able to decipher the higher pitched tones but were unable to distinguish the lower notes from the background melody. It became apparent that the lower notes caused some sort of auditory and sensory problem for the dyslexic children that made it harder for their brain to sort out the information being sent to it. A study done by Bianca Pinheiro Lanzetta-Valdo and team looked at children with the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and dichotic pitch. At the beginning of the experiment, all of the children were at a base level of the medication methylphenidate, a stimulant that is used to try and calm individuals with ADHD. Over a 6-month period, the children were given auditory stimulation that consisted of white noise, and during this stimulation, they would be given physical, neurological, visual and auditory examinations, as well as biochemical tests to see if any improvement was made. Lanzetta-Valdo and collaborators did find any improvements in the participants over the 6 months in their different evaluations, but there are controversial results on this topic.

Most of the original music was composed by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori, but also includes a bonus track, \\"LvUrFR3NZ\\", which was the winning entry in a contest held before the soundtrack's release. The 2-CD set was released on November 20, 2007. For the next game in the Halo trilogy, O'Donnell added new themes as well as bringing back and expanding old ones, some of which had never been recorded with a full orchestra before. The score made extensive use of the piano, an instrument which O'Donnell used frequently for composition but that had not been featured in previous Halo music. In addition to scoring the game, the music was used for promotional advertisements and trailers preceding Halo 3s release. The game's score and its soundtrack were generally well received. The soundtrack reached the Billboard 200 chart, and also broke the top twenty best-selling soundtracks and independent albums listings. The score was nominated for X-Plays \\"Best of 2007\\" awards, under best original soundtrack. Background Martin O'Donnell at the launch of Halo 3 in Bellevue, Washington The score for Halo 3 gave O'Donnell and Salvatori a chance to rework and revise existing themes heard in the games, as well as create new ones. Halo: Combat Evolved featured more strings, while the soundtrack to Halo 2 featured conventional video game music staples such as guitars by Steve Vai; in an interview, O'Donnell noted that \\"to be honest, when I got to the end of Halo 2 I thought to myself: 'that was probably enough guitar.'\\" He intentionally made the score to the final game a shift back to the orchestral roots of the series, stating \\"I took an orthodox, almost formal approach to the trilogy.\\" O'Donnell acknowledged that some games and movies used entirely different music with each sequel, but such an approach wasn't an option with Halo 3, the third installment of a trilogy: \\"The Master Chief is still green, Cortana is still blue, and so you're going to hear the monks and the cellos.\\" O'Donnell began by writing out the reworked themes and music he wanted to hear in the game, without knowing where he would eventually use the sounds. He approaches composition from the piano, and described his process as looking for something that \\"makes me go 'oh, thats a good feeling'\\". O'Donnell's approach to writing music for games is to put in the audio at the last minute of development, so that his music meshes with the game play in the best possible way; he still had not added the score when Halo 3 was demoed at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2007, less than three months away from the game's debut. Unlike previous soundtracks, where much of the music had been synthesized on computer, the soundtrack for Halo 3 was recorded using a 60-piece orchestra, along with a 24 voice chorus. The music was recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Studio X in Seattle, Washington. Interviewed by some of Bungie's staff for the Bungie Podcast, O'Donnell noted that there was more \\"techno\\" and \\"tribal\\" sounds than on previous soundtracks. O'Donnell also tried to avoid outside musical influences, as he believes that \\"Bungie should be creating culture, not being influenced by it.\\" Scoring for a video game, O'Donnell noted, is different from a film in that a good score sounds like it is narrating what the player does on screen; Halo 3 uses an audio engine which allows music cues to naturally start, stop, and transition in response to game triggers. Working from his office at Bungie, dubbed the \\"Ivory Tower\\", O'Donnell worked with mission designers to set points in the game that trigger segments of music. Instead of pieces with a set duration, songs in the game have multiple variations that can be looped and arranged to fill the time it takes the player to travel from point A to point B. Since the interactive mixing of sounds in Halo 3 depends on what occurs in the game, O'Donnell instead \\"froze\\" the music into set suites and transitions for the CD, so that a listener playing the soundtrack through would hear a musical representation of the game. The tracks are presented, similarly to the previous soundtrack for Halo 2, in a suite form. The suites are named after the nine Campaign missions and unlike Volume Two, are broken into separate tracks. Promotion Martin O'Donnell confirmed Halo 3s soundtrack would see a commercial release in a Bungie podcast. O'Donnell also stressed that the soundtrack would not be released at or near the release date of the game on September 25, 2007. The soundtrack was officially announced on October 17, 2007. The score to the game was used extensively for marketing purposes, even before the release of the game. The first piece heard was entitled \\"Finish the Fight\\", and was used in the announcement trailer for Halo3 at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2006. This piece was accented with O'Donnell's well-known Halo theme, which now included a trumpet fanfare and heavy brass section; O'Donnell stated \\"I want the viewer to have a feeling of anticipation and wonder for the first fifty seconds or so, up until Master Chief is revealed and they realize that it's Cortana trying to tell them something.\\" The track opens with a piano section written by Matt Daspit, uncharacteristic for the series at that point; O'Donnell suspected \\"no [other announcement at E3] would start with a piano\\", thus grabbing attention. O'Donnell designed the opening to lull the listener into a sense of suspense, then wonder; \\"I want them to feel pride and longing the moment Master Chief walks out of the smoke.\\" he said. \\"I want them to be left with that, 'I can hardly wait to play this game' feeling\\". Another reworked theme from Halo was used as the background music for the Halo 3 E3 2007 trailer; O'Donnell later offered this track for free online. In addition to the music composed by O'Donnell and Salvatori, the announcement of the Halo3 Soundtrack was followed with a call for entries to all artists or bands to submit their own original song to be included on the final CD. The submissions were judged by O'Donnell, producer Nile Rodgers, and other artists including Steve Vai. Rodgers stated that more than 21,000 songs were entered, and at least 30% were \\"amazing\\"; the winner was Greg Haupt and his band Princeton, whose song \\"LvUrFR3NZ\\" appears as the final track on the second disc. Reception O'Donnell (top right on stage) at Video Games Live Reception to the soundtrack was positive. Scorenotes.com gave the soundtrack high marks, praising the presentation as well as the piano motif introduced; the reviewer judged that the soundtrack for the third game surpassed those of the previous titles. UGO Networks praised the reworked main theme, stating that the video game \\"would not have been the same\\" without O'Donnell's score. Game Informers Brendan Vore concurred, saying that \\"there's nothing like hearing Halo's signature 'da-da-da-duuum' as you rush into a squad of Brutes.\\" Conversely, IGN found the piano theme was perennially overplayed, and felt that the soundtrack \\"begins with a bit of a bang and then eventually sputters out\\". The Halo3 Soundtrack reached a peak position of #18 on Billboard's Top Soundtracks list, #20 on Top Independent Albums, and the bottom position on the Billboard 200 on December 15, 2007. The soundtrack had an impact outside of the gaming world; fueled by interest in Halos chants, Universal Music aggressively promoted a chant-based album, Chant: Music for the Soul, that sold 55,000copies in its first two weeks. Halo 3s music has been featured at several concerts, including Play! A Video Game Symphony. O'Donnell also specially arranged the Halo music for a performance of Video Games Live, and appeared at a London performance. Video Games Live has incorporated the music from Halo 3 into many of its performances, including the opening to the London Games Festival, and the 2008 Game Developer's Conference in San Francisco. Arrangements featuring music from Halo 3 appears on the album releases Video Games Live, Vol. 1 and Video Games Live, Level 2. =Awards= The audio and sound for Halo 3 were nominated for numerous awards, including the 2007 Spike TV Video Game Awards \\"Best Original Score\\". Both the sound and score of Halo3 were also nominated as finalists in the 6th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards, and X-Play's \\"Best of 2007\\" Awards in the \\"Best Original Soundtrack\\" category.

The book, issued by Spencer & Stockton of Ithaca, New York, lifted heavily from The Columbian Spelling-Book published by Daniel Crandall in Cooperstown, New York, in 1819. However, it was Cobb's book, not Crandall's, that became a success. Cobb's book, revised and reprinted, sold about 4 million copies into the 1850s and was the chief competitor of Webster's very successful spelling book from about 1825 to 1845. With the notoriety gained from his speller, Cobb moved to New York City in the 1820s, continued to produce a variety of school textbooks and became a leading opponent of corporal punishment in schools.

It is the first poem in the collection Men and Women. Overview The poem begins: Browning here employs an unusual structure of rhyming couplets in which long trochaic lines are paired with short lines of three syllables. This may be related to the theme of the poem, a comparison between love and material glory. The speaker, overlooking a pasture where sheep graze, recalls that once a great ancient city, his country's capital, stood there. After spending four stanzas describing the beauty and grandeur of the ancient city, the speaker says that \\"a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair/Waits me there\\", and that \\"she looks now, breathless, dumb/Till I come.\\" The speaker, after musing further on the glory of the city and thinking of how he will greet his lover, closes by rejecting the majesty of the old capital and preferring instead his love: In culture Browning's poem inspired or gave its title to many subsequent works, including a painting by Edward Burne-Jones, a 1975 TV-movie with Katharine Hepburn and Laurence Olivier, an episode of the American TV series Mad Men, and an album and song by the band 10,000 Maniacs. The poem is quoted by the character Rupert Birkin in Women in Love, a novel by D. H. Lawrence. The title of the poem is also made the title of a novella by the British satirist Evelyn Waugh.

The species is known from only two specimens; the holotype collected by Roland McKay in 1985 from a Taipei market, both specimens of which were taken from the waters of Taiwan. Apart from a relatively small eye size, the species is hard to distinguish from other common species of sillaginid taken in the area, and may be a minor part of local fisheries. Taxonomy and naming The small-eyed whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt-whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidei. The species was first described by Roland McKay in his 1985 review of the Sillaginidae based on two specimens collected from a Taipei market, Taiwan; one of which was designated to be the type specimen. The species binomial and common names both reflect the distinguishing feature of the species; its unusually small eyes. Description The small-eyed whiting is very similar in appearance to other members of the genus Sillago, with the only obvious distinguishing feature of the species being its unusually small eye size (only 14% to 16% of head length), as well as its swim bladder morphology. Other diagnostic features include the spine and ray counts, with the first spinous dorsal fin having 11 spines and the second dorsal fin having one spine and 19 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines followed by 19 soft rays. The species has 34 vertebrae and 68 to 69 lateral line scales, with cycloid cheek scales. The species reaches at least 20 cm in length. The body is a pale to dull brown colour, lighter on the underside of the fish and usually having a faint mid-lateral band below the lateral line. The fins are all hyaline in colour with the exception of the spinous dorsal fin which is dusky at the tips, with five or six rows of dusky spots on the membranes of the second dorsal fin. Distribution and habitat The only two recorded specimens of the small-eyed whiting were taken from a market in Taipei, Taiwan. No other records of the fish have been reported. The habitat of the species is also largely unknown, but the only specimens were taken alongside both Sillago sihama and Sillago parvisquamis which inhabit primarily sandy and silty substrates in major estuaries, thus indicating S. microps may as well. Nothing else is known of the biology or the contribution to local fisheries of the small-eyed whiting.

The design is modified from that of previous ships of that class, and slightly larger than , at , largely due to a more vertical stern. The ship is able to carry up to 2092 passengers. The ship's name was announced by Cunard on 10 October 2007. Since the retirement of in 2008 the company has operated three vessels. The naming of the ship as Queen Elizabeth brings about a situation similar to that between 1940 and 1948, when Cunard's original Queen Elizabeth was in service at the same time as the Royal Navy battleship . Design =Exterior= Queen Elizabeth is almost identical in design to Queen Victoria, although because of the steeper stern, at her introduction into service the passenger capacity was slightly higher with up to 2,058 compared to Queen Victorias 2,014. Also unlike many previous Cunard Queens, Queen Elizabeth is not a true ocean liner as she does not have the heavy plating throughout the hull. However the bow was constructed with heavier plating to cope with the transatlantic run, and the ship has a high freeboard. =Interior= Although having an almost identical interior arrangement to Queen Victoria, the decor is very different. The ship is a tribute to the two previous Queen Elizabeth-named ships: the original and . She also evokes the era of the 1930s, in which Cunard's first Queen Elizabeth was launched, with many art deco interior touches. The ship also features a Britannia Club section of the main restaurant, which is a feature popular on , but not available on Queen Victoria. This service allows passengers in the Britannia staterooms to have single seating dining arrangements, without having to upgrade to the more expensive Grills classes. The sliding roof over the Winter Garden featured on Queen Victoria is replaced with a simple glass roof (the space being renamed The Garden Lounge). Onboard services =Classes of service= There four classes of service on the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship: Britannia, Britannia Club, Princess Grill and Queens Grill. These can be thought of as economy, premium, business class and first class. The Britannia class cabins have of internal space, while the first class Queens Grill suites measure up to including the balcony. Each of the four classes have their own restaurant, the most exclusive of which is the Queen's Grill Restaurant. Launch Following the ship's construction in Italy from 2007 to 2010, Cunard Line officially confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II would name Cunard's new ship. The ceremony was held in Southampton on 11 October 2010 before the ship set sail on her maiden voyage to the Canary Islands the following day. The Queen was also the sponsor of the now-retired Queen Elizabeth 2 in 1967 and Cunard's current flagship, Queen Mary 2, in 2004. Service history The first master of Queen Elizabeth was Captain Christopher Wells. On 4 October 2010 Queen Elizabeth was formally handed over to Cunard. She sailed on her maiden voyage from Southampton on 12 October 2010, following a naming ceremony with the monarch on 11 October 2010. At the end of October 2011 Queen Elizabeth and her fleet mates changed their registries to Hamilton, Bermuda, in order to host weddings aboard. On 29 June 2012, the ship made her one and only visit to Ny-Ålesund, in Svalbard. The previous scheduled visit in 2011 had to be aborted due to bad weather. However, she was not scheduled to visit Svalbard in her 2013 schedule. Legislation relating to cruise ships visiting the archipelago (applicable from 2014) meant that Queen Elizabeth will never be able to visit again. On 31 August 2013, British journalist and broadcaster Sir David Frost had been invited to give a speech by Cunard whilst travelling on board the ship but died of a heart attack.

Plot Act One opens in 1520 at the Field of Cloth of Gold in Calais, France, a peace treaty organized by Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop of York. Henry VIII, king of England is there with his wife, Catherine of Aragon, daughter Mary and a large part of his court, including his fool, Will Somers, and court musician Mark Smeaton with whom he shares his latest song composition, “No Song More Pleasing” which charms and delights everyone present. At the meeting with King Francis of France, Henry meets Anne Boleyn and immediately becomes smitten with her. Having failed to produce a male heir with his wife Catherine (“Where is My Son?”), Henry considers divorcing her and marrying Anne. Henry's court astrologer Comus, along with Will Somers, Mark Smeaton and Cardinal Wolsey humorously lament Henry's notorious wandering eye in “The Chase” leaving Henry to pluck the petals from a daisy to prophesize the outcome of his desire for Anne. Catherine refuses to grant Henry a divorce, so Henry founds the Church of England, and thus divorces and banishes Catherine. Passionately in love, Henry and Anne admit that they cannot bear to be “Away From You”, but after their marriage, things sour when Anne gives birth, not to a son, but to daughter “Elizabeth.” Things become further strained as Anne becomes intrigued with Mark Smeaton, and Henry with Jane Seymour, one of Anne's ladies-in-waiting. Charges of treason against Anne and Smeaton are laid and they are found guilty. Shortly before her execution, Anne and Henry reflect on their time together, “So Much You Loved Me.” Will promises Anne that he will look after Elizabeth. Henry marries Jane Seymour and they have a son together, Edward, but Jane dies in childbirth, leaving Henry conflicted as he rejoices in the arrival of his son, but questioning his methods in this pursuit. Act Two opens 10 years later. Since the end of Act One, Henry has had three more wives: Anne of Cleves (divorced) and Catherine Howard (executed) and is now married to Katharine Parr, a matronly widow, who satisfies the elder Henry's need for companionship in his later years. Edward is now a child of 10, Elizabeth is a healthy young woman and, joined by their half-sister, Mary, they celebrate “Christmas at Hampton Court.” Francis of France arrives to discuss the terms for peace at the holiday and brings Henry a gift: pear trees from Anjou, a rare fruit which comes to fruition once every ten years. Following a ferocious altercation with Elizabeth, Henry realizes that he admires her regal courage and that Elizabeth is the \\"son\\" he never had; but to love and admire her duly, it must be “From Afar” and he banishes her from the kingdom. Will Somers cheers Elizabeth up, and then proceeds to humorously torment Comus who is in the course of charting the worst prediction of his career: Edward will not live to maturity and Elizabeth will become a great leader. Henry falls ill and reflects on the events and motives in his life, and while he is still determined to live to see the fruition of “The Pears of Anjou,” he dies. Elizabeth gives encouragement to the nervous Edward, telling him that with courage and determination, he will be a fine king \\"In Time.\\" Edward ascends to the throne, but in a final tableau, we see Henry's realization and acceptance that Elizabeth will become the great ruler that he had always wanted to bequeath to England.

The ships served as the flagships of the commander and deputy commander of the Mediterranean Squadron for most of their careers. The sister ships took part in the French conquest of Tunisia, notably shelling and landing troops in Sfax in 1881. They were relegated to second-line roles in 1894–95 before being condemned in 1900. The ships were finally sold for scrap in 1909. Design and description The Colbert-class ships were designed by Constructor Sabattier as improved versions of the ironclad and were the last ships authorized by the 1857 Naval Program.

The ship's secondary armament consisted of six guns, four forward of the battery and two aft. These latter two guns were replaced in 1878 by another 240-millimeter gun as a stern chaser.

Biography After three years of line-up changes, Anvil of Doom really started their serious career in 2002. Their demo Died Before Dawn led them to sign a deal with Spanish Metal label Xtreem Music. Throughout 2003, they worked on new material for their first album while improving their live presence, playing through all Andalusia with local bands, even sharing the stage with Spanish legends Barón Rojo, Soziedad Alkoholika, and Avulsed. They also took part in the Xtreem Music Festival in Madrid, with bands like Exodus, Nuclear Assault and Grave. In January 2004, the band began studio sessions for their first album. Deathillusion was to include three re- recordings from the demo, as well as six new songs which reflected a clear evolution to a more technical kind of death metal, without losing the band’s distinctive melodic touch. The album was released in October and received good reviews in specialized media around the world. After that, they kept on the road, playing with some of the biggest bands in the genre in summer fests like The Metalway Festival, and headlining underground festivals in their own country. During 2007 the band focused on composing and rehearsing new songs for their second album, marking a clear distance from the Melodic label. By early 2008, vocalist and guitarist left the band, breaking the creative process leading to AOD's second album. They were replaced through that year by guitarist Ángel L. Berlanga and Andhord's vocalist Kvoraph, though by February 2009 the band decided to do without Ángel, because he didn't actually fit the band's needs. He was replaced by John M. Peterson, the man behind the band Perseidan, while MG, from Sevillian Death Metal act Neter, was recruited on the vocal role to replace Kvoraph after his decision to quit the band in September 2009. In summer 2009, Anvil of Doom resumed touring, taking part in several festivals around Andalusia included in the so-called Re(TOUR)synthesis. In 2011, AOD released an EP entitled \\"Turn Your Back\\", along with a videoclip of the title track. This release was supported by an extensive Spanish tour, which saw the band playing next to international legends like Malevolent Creation and Pestilence. In summer 2012, Anvil of Doom starts pre-production for their long-expected second full-length, in order to begin recording by fall. Style and influences The band's style is mostly concerned with death metal. In their early stages, the band was more focused on melodic death metal, significantly influenced by Swedish bands such as Arch Enemy, Darkane, In Flames and Soilwork. After recording Died Before Dawn, the new compositions for Deathillusion pointed to a more technical approach on the steps of North American acts like Death, and more presence of classical thrash metal riffs, without losing the band's distinctive melodic reference. This tendency is more patent on recent songs, composed for their future second album.

Constructed in 1842 at the height of the canal era, it remains today as legacy of the industrial era and a major leisure facility for residents of Bury, Bolton and North Manchester. Description The reservoir covers 226,000 sq m (56 acres) and contains some 1 million cubic metres (220 million imperial gallons). It is an important area for both resident and migrating water fowl, attracting many species throughout the year. History The aqueduct at Burrs Country Park, used to feed water to the reservoir. The reservoir was constructed and opened in 1842 as a feeder for the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal. The water was used to top up the canal as water was lost at the bottom end of the canal. Initially, water was to have been taken from the River Irwell, however local mill owners objected citing a loss of water for their mills so the reservoir was constructed. Today water is still taken from the Irwell at Burrs Country Park and taken by feeder channel to Elton Reservoir which in turn feeds the remains of the canal. Leisure use The reservoir has been used for leisure since the Elton Club was founded in 1858. This club was initially for 'Gentlemen and their sons' to engage in the pursuit of fishing. The club later became the Elton Sailing Club and since 1870, the club has carried out sailing activities. The reservoir is also used for sailing activities by local community groups, Greater Manchester Police Sailing & Windsurfing Section and the scouts. The Triathlon clubs of Rochdale and Bolton also use the reservoir for Open Water swimming. The reservoir is now an important fishery in the north west of England managed by Bury Angling Association. The coarse fishery contains many species including, bream, pike, carp, tench and roach. The National Cycle Route 6 passes alongside the reservoir. There is 6.5 km (4 ml) walking path around the reservoir which is described in the Bury Council book entitled \\"Walks Around Bury\\", Copies can be obtained at local libraries and Bury Tourist Information Centre or downloaded from the Bury MBC web site References External links * National Cycle Route 6 Category:Geography of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury Category:Reservoirs in Greater Manchester Category:Canal reservoirs in England Category:Irwell Valley ","title":"Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Reservoir"},{"id":"13692835","text":"Novopetrovsky (masculine), Novopetrovskaya (feminine), or Novopetrovskoye (neuter) may refer to: *Novopetrovskoye, name of the town of Fort-Shevchenko, Kazakhstan before 1857 *Novopetrovskoye, Republic of Bashkortostan, a village (selo) in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia *Novopetrovskoye, name of several other rural localities in Russia See also *Novopetrovka *Novopetrovsk (disambiguation) *Petrovsky (disambiguation) ","title":"Novopetrovsky"},{"id":"13692847","text":"Novopetrovka may refer to: *Novopetrovka, Blagoveshchensky District, Amur Oblast, a village (selo) in Blagoveshchensky District of Amur Oblast, Russia *Novopetrovka, Konstantinovsky District, Amur Oblast, a village (selo) in Konstantinovsky District of Amur Oblast, Russia *Novopetrovka, name of several other rural localities in Russia See also * Novopetrovsk (disambiguation) * Novopetrovsky (disambiguation) ","title":"Novopetrovka"},{"id":"13692861","text":"In gambling parlance, making a book is the practice of laying bets on the various possible outcomes of a single event. The term originates from the practice of recording such wagers in a hard-bound ledger (the 'book') and gives the English language the term bookmaker for the person laying the bets and thus 'making the book'.Sidney 1976, p.6Sidney 2003, p.13,36 Making a 'book' (and the notion of overround) A bookmaker strives to accept bets on the outcome of an event in the right proportions in order to make a profit regardless of which outcome prevails. See Dutch book and coherence (philosophical gambling strategy). This is achieved primarily by adjusting what are determined to be the true odds of the various outcomes of an event in a downward fashion (i.e. the bookmaker will pay out using his actual odds, an amount which is less than the true odds would have paid, thus ensuring a profit). The odds quoted for a particular event may be fixed but are more likely to fluctuate in order to take account of the size of wagers placed by the bettors in the run-up to the actual event (e.g. a horse race). This article explains the mathematics of making a book in the (simpler) case of the former event. For the second method, see Parimutuel betting. It is important to understand the relationship between fractional and decimal odds. Fractional odds are those written a-b (a/b or a to b) mean a winning bettor will receive their money back plus a units for every b units they bet. Multiplying both a and b by the same number gives odds equivalent to a-b. Decimal odds are a single value, greater than 1, representing the amount to be paid out for each unit bet. For example, a bet of £40 at 6-4 (fractional odds) will pay out £40 + £60 = £100. The equivalent decimal odds are 2.5; £40 x 2.5 = £100. We can convert fractional to decimal odds by the formula D=. Hence, fractional odds of a-1 (ie. b=1) can be obtained from decimal odds by a=D-1. It is also important to understand the relationship between odds and implied probabilities: Fractional odds of a-b (with corresponding decimal odds D) represent an implied probability of =, e.g. 6-4 corresponds to = = 0.4 (40%). An implied probability of x is represented by fractional odds of (1-x)/x, e.g. 0.2 is (1-0.2)/0.2 = 0.8/0.2 = 4/1 (4-1, 4 to 1) (equivalently, to 1), and decimal odds of D=. =Example= In considering a football match (the event) that can be either a 'home win', 'draw' or 'away win' (the outcomes) then the following odds might be encountered to represent the true chance of each of the three outcomes: :Home: Evens :Draw: 2-1 :Away: 5-1 These odds can be represented as implied probabilities (or percentages by multiplying by 100) as follows: :Evens (or 1-1) corresponds to an implied probability of (50%) :2-1 corresponds to an implied probability of (33%) :5-1 corresponds to an implied probability of (16%) By adding the percentages together a total 'book' of 100% is achieved (representing a fair book). The bookmaker, in his wish to avail himself of a profit, will invariably reduce these odds. Consider the simplest model of reducing, which uses a proportional decreasing of odds. For the above example, the following odds are in the same proportion with regard to their implied probabilities (3:2:1): :Home: 4-6 :Draw: 6-4 :Away: 4-1 :4-6 corresponds to an implied probability of (60%) :6-4 corresponds to an implied probability of (40%) :4-1 corresponds to an implied probability of (20%) By adding these percentages together a 'book' of 120% is achieved. The amount by which the actual 'book' exceeds 100% is known as the 'overround',Sidney 1976, p.96-104Sidney 2003, p.126-130 'bookmaker margin' or the 'vigorish' or 'vig': it represents the bookmaker's expected profit. Thus, in an \\"ideal\\" situation, if the bookmaker accepts £120 in bets at his own quoted odds in the correct proportion, he will pay out only £100 (including returned stakes) no matter what the actual outcome of the football match. Examining how he potentially achieves this: :A stake of £60.00 @ 4-6 returns £100.00 (exactly) for a home win. :A stake of £40.00 @ 6-4 returns £100.00 (exactly) for a drawn match :A stake of £20.00 @ 4-1 returns £100.00 (exactly) for an away win Total stakes received -- £120.00 and a maximum payout of £100.00 irrespective of the result. This £20.00 profit represents a 16 % profit on turnover (20.00/120.00). In reality, bookmakers use models of reducing that are more complicated than the model of the \\"ideal\\" situation. = Bookmaker margin in English football leagues = Bookmaker margin in English football leagues decreased in recent years. The study of six large bookmakers between 2005/06 season and 2017/2018 season showed that average margin in Premier League decreased from 9% to 4%, in English Football League Championship, English Football League One, and English Football League Two from 11% to 6%, and in National League from 11% to 8%. Overround on multiple bets When a punter (bettor) combines more than one selection in, for example, a double, treble or accumulator then the effect of the overround in the book of each selection is compounded to the detriment of the punter in terms of the financial return compared to the true odds of all of the selections winning and thus resulting in a successful bet. To explain the concept in the most basic of situations an example consisting of a double made up of selecting the winner from each of two tennis matches will be looked at: In Match 1 between players A and B both players are assessed to have an equal chance of winning. The situation is the same in Match 2 between players C and D. In a fair book in each of their matches, i.e. each has a book of 100%, all players would be offered at odds of Evens (1-1). However, a bookmaker would probably offer odds of 5-6 (for example) on each of the two possible outcomes in each event (each tennis match). This results in a book for each of the tennis matches of 109.09...%, calculated by 100 × ( + ) i.e. 9.09% overround. There are four possible outcomes from combining the results from both matches: the winning pair of players could be AC, AD, BC or BD. As each of the outcomes for this example has been deliberately chosen to ensure that they are equally likely it can be deduced that the probability of each outcome occurring is or 0.25 and that the fractional odds against each one occurring is 3-1. A bet of 100 units (for simplicity) on any of the four combinations would produce a return of 100 × (3/1 + 1) = 400 units if successful, reflecting decimal odds of 4.0. The decimal odds of a multiple bet is often calculated by multiplying the decimal odds of the individual bets, the idea being that if the events are independent then the implied probability should be the product of the implied probabilities of the individual bets. In the above case with fractional odds of 5-6, the decimal odds are . So the decimal odds of the double bet is ×=1.833...×1.833...=3.3611..., or fractional odds of 2.3611-1. This represents an implied probability of 29.752% (1/3.3611) and multiplying by 4 (for each of the four equally likely combinations of outcomes) gives a total book of 119.01%. Thus the overround has slightly more than doubled by combining two single bets into a double. In general, the combined overround on a double (OD), expressed as a percentage, is calculated from the individual books B1 and B2, expressed as decimals, by OD = B1 × B2 × 100 − 100\\\\. In the example we have OD = 1.0909 × 1.0909 × 100 − 100 = 19.01%. This massive increase in potential profit for the bookmaker (19% instead of 9% on an event; in this case the double) is the main reason why bookmakers pay bonuses for the successful selection of winners in multiple bets: compare offering a 25% bonus on the correct choice of four winners from four selections in a Yankee, for example, when the potential overround on a simple fourfold of races with individual books of 120% is over 107% (a book of 207%). This is why bookmakers offer bets such as Lucky 15, Lucky 31 and Lucky 63; offering double the odds for one winner and increasing percentage bonuses for two, three and more winners. In general, for any accumulator bet from two to i selections, the combined percentage overround of books of B1, B2, ..., Bi given in terms of decimals, is calculated by B1 × B2 × ... × Bi × 100 − 100\\\\. E.g. the previously mentioned fourfold consisting of individual books of 120% (1.20) gives an overround of 1.20 × 1.20 × 1.20 × 1.20 × 100 − 100 = 107.36%. Settling winning bets In settling winning bets either decimal odds are used or one is added to the fractional odds: this is to include the stake in the return. The place part of each-way bets is calculated separately from the win part; the method is identical but the odds are reduced by whatever the place factor is for the particular event (see Accumulator below for detailed example). All bets are taken as 'win' bets unless 'each-way' is specifically stated. All show use of fractional odds: replace (fractional odds + 1) by decimal odds if decimal odds known. Non-runners are treated as winners with fractional odds of zero (decimal odds of 1). Fractions of pence in total winnings are invariably rounded down by bookmakers to the nearest penny below. Calculations below for multiple-bet wagers result in totals being shown for the separate categories (e.g. doubles, trebles etc.), and therefore overall returns may not be exactly the same as the amount received from using the computer software available to bookmakers to calculate total winnings.Sidney 1976, p.138-147Sidney 2003, p.163-177 =Singles= Win single E.g. £100 single at 9-2; total staked = £100 :Returns = £100 × (9/2 + 1) = £100 × 5.5 = £550 Each-way single E.g. £100 each-way single at 11-4 ( odds a place); total staked = £200 :Returns (win) = £100 × (11/4 + 1) = £100 × 3.75 = £375 :Returns (place) = £100 × (11/20 + 1) = £100 × 1.55 = £155 :Total returns if selection wins = £530; if only placed = £155 =Multiple bets= Each-Way multiple bets are usually settled using a default \\"Win to Win, Place to Place\\" method, meaning that the bet consists of a win accumulator and a separate place accumulator (Note: a double or treble is an accumulator with 2 or 3 selections respectively). However, a more uncommon way of settling these type of bets is \\"Each-Way all Each-Way\\" (known as \\"Equally Divided\\", which must normally be requested as such on the betting slip) in which the returns from one selection in the accumulator are split to form an equal-stake each-way bet on the next selection and so on until all selections have been used.Sidney 1976, p.155-156Sidney 2003, p.170-171 The first example below shows the two different approaches to settling these types of bets. DoubleSidney 1976, p.153-168Sidney 2003, p.169-177 E.g. £100 each-way double with winners at 2-1 ( odds a place) and 5-4 ( odds a place); total staked = £200 :Returns (win double) = £100 × (2/1 + 1) × (5/4 + 1) = £675 :Returns (place double) = £100 × (2/5 + 1) × (5/16 + 1) = £183.75 :Total returns = £858.75 :Returns (first selection) = £100 × (2/1 + 1) + £100 × (2/5 + 1) = £440 which is split equally to give a £220 each-way bet on the second selection) :Returns (second selection) = £220 × (5/4 + 1) + £220 × (5/16 + 1) = £783.75 :Total returns = £783.85 Note: \\"Win to Win, Place to Place\\" will always provide a greater return if all selections win, whereas \\"Each-Way all Each-Way\\" provides greater compensation if one selection is a loser as each of the other winners provide a greater amount of place money for subsequent selections. Treble E.g. £100 treble with winners at 3-1, 4-6 and 11-4; total staked = £100 :Returns = £100 × (3/1 + 1) × (4/6 + 1) × (11/4 + 1) = £2500 Accumulator E.g. £100 each-way fivefold accumulator with winners at Evens ( odds a place), 11-8 ( odds), 5-4 ( odds), 1-2 (all up to win) and 3-1 ( odds); total staked = £200 Note: 'All up to win' means there are insufficient participants in the event for place odds to be given (e.g. 4 or fewer runners in a horse race). The only 'place' therefore is first place, for which the win odds are given. :Returns (win fivefold) = £100 × (1/1 + 1) × (11/8 + 1) × (5/4 + 1) × (1/2 + 1) × (3/1 + 1) = £6412.50 :Returns (place fivefold) = £100 × (1/4 + 1) × (11/40 + 1) × (5/16 + 1) × (1/2 + 1) × (3/5 + 1) = £502.03 :Total returns = £6914.53 =Full-cover bets= Trixie :Returns (3 doubles) = £10 × [(4/7 + 1) × (2/1 + 1) + (4/7 + 1) × (11/10 + 1) + (2/1 + 1) × (11/10 + 1)] = £143.14 :Returns (1 treble) = £10 × (4/7 + 1) × (2/1 + 1) × (11/10 + 1) = £99.00 :Total returns = £242.14 Yankee :Returns (6 doubles) = £10 × [(1/3 + 1) × (5/2 + 1) + (1/3 + 1) × (6/4 + 1) + (1/3 + 1) × (1/1 + 1) + (5/2 + 1) × (6/4 + 1) + (5/2 + 1) × (1/1 + 1) + (6/4 + 1) × (1/1 + 1)] = £314.16 :Returns (4 trebles) = £10 × [(1/3 + 1) × (5/2 + 1) × (6/4 + 1) + (1/3 + 1) × (5/2 + 1) × (1/1 + 1) + (1/3 + 1) × (6/4 + 1) × (1/1 + 1) + (5/2 + 1) × (6/4 + 1) × (1/1 + 1)] = £451.66 :Returns (1 fourfold) = £10 × (1/3 + 1) × (5/2 + 1) × (6/4 + 1) × (1/1 + 1) = £233.33 :Total returns = £999.15 Trixie, Yankee, Canadian, Heinz, Super Heinz and Goliath form a family of bets known as full cover bets which have all possible multiples present. Examples of winning Trixie and Yankee bets have been shown above. The other named bets are calculated in a similar way by looking at all the possible combinations of selections in their multiples. Note: A Double may be thought of as a full cover bet with only two selections. Should a selection in one of these bets not win, then the remaining winners are treated as being a wholly successful bet on the next 'family member' down. For example, only two winners out of three in a Trixie means the bet is settled as a double; only four winners out of five in a Canadian means it is settled as a Yankee; only five winners out of eight in a Goliath means it is settled as a Canadian. The place part of each-way bets is calculated separately using reduced place odds. Thus, an each-way Super Heinz on seven horses with three winners and a further two placed horses is settled as a win Trixie and a place Canadian. Virtually all bookmakers use computer software for ease, speed and accuracy of calculation for the settling of multiples bets. =Full cover bets with singles= Patent :Returns (3 singles) = £2 × [(4/6 + 1) + (2/1 + 1) + (11/4 + 1)] = £16.83 :Returns (3 doubles) = £2 × [(4/6 + 1) × (2/1 + 1) + (4/6 + 1) × (11/4 + 1) + (2/1 + 1) × (11/4 + 1)] = £45.00 :Returns (1 treble) = £2 × (4/6 + 1) × (2/1 + 1) × (11/4 + 1) = £37.50 :Total returns = £99.33 Patent, Lucky 15, Lucky 31, Lucky 63 and higher Lucky bets form a family of bets known as full cover bets with singles which have all possible multiples present together with single bets on all selections. An examples of a winning Patent bet has been shown above. The other named bets are calculated in a similar way by looking at all the possible combinations of selections in their multiples and singles. Should a selection in one of these bets not win, then the remaining winners are treated as being a wholly successful bet on the next 'family member' down. For example, only two winners out of three in a Patent means the bet is settled as a double and two singles; only three winners out of four in a Lucky 15 means it is settled as a Patent; only four winners out of six in a Lucky 63 means it is settled as a Lucky 15. The place part of each-way bets is calculated separately using reduced place odds. Thus, an each-way Lucky 63 on six horses with three winners and a further two placed horses is settled as a win Patent and a place Lucky 31. Algebraic interpretation Returns on any bet may be considered to be calculated as 'stake unit' × 'odds multiplier'. The overall 'odds multiplier' is a combined decimal odds value and is the result of all the individual bets that make up a full cover bet, including singles if needed. E.g. if a successful £10 Yankee returned £461.35 then the overall 'odds multiplier' (OM) is 46.135. If a, b, c, d... represent the decimal odds, i.e. (fractional odds + 1), then an OM can be calculated algebraically by multiplying the expressions (a + 1), (b + 1), (c + 1)... etc. together in the required manner and subtracting 1. If required, (decimal odds + 1) may be replaced by (fractional odds + 2).Sidney 1976, p.166Sidney 2003, p.169,176 =Examples= 3 selections with decimal odds a, b and c. Expanding (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) algebraically gives abc + ab + ac + bc + a + b + c + 1. This is equivalent to the OM for a Patent (treble: abc; doubles: ab, ac and bc; singles: a, b and c) plus 1. Therefore to calculate the returns for a winning Patent it is just a case of multiplying (a + 1), (b + 1) and (c + 1) together and subtracting 1 to get the OM for the winning bet, i.e. OM = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) − 1\\\\. Now multiply by the unit stake to get the total return on the bet.Sidney 1976, p.161Sidney 2003, p.176 E.g. The winning Patent described earlier can be more quickly and simply evaluated by the following: :Total returns = £2 × [(4/6 + 2) × (2/1 + 2) × (11/4 + 2) − 1] = £99.33 Ignoring any bonuses, a 50 pence each-way Lucky 63 (total stake £63) with 4 winners [2-1, 5-2, 7-2 (all odds a place) and 6-4 ( odds a place)] and a further placed horse [9-2 ( odds a place)] can be relatively easily calculated as follows: :Returns (win part) = 0.50 × [(2/1 + 2) × (5/2 + 2) × (7/2 + 2) × (6/4 + 2) − 1] = £172.75 :or more simply as 0.50 × (4 × 4.5 × 5.5 × 3.5 − 1) :Returns (place part) = 0.50 × [(2/5 + 2) × (5/10 + 2) × (7/10 + 2) × (6/16 + 2) × (9/10 + 2) − 1] = £11.79 :or more simply as 0.50 × (2.4 × 2.5 × 2.7 × 2.375 × 2.9 − 1) :Total returns = £184.54 For the family of full cover bets that do not include singles an adjustment to the calculation is made to leave just the doubles, trebles and accumulators. Thus, a previously described winning £10 Yankee with winners at 1-3, 5-2, 6-4 and Evens has returns calculated by: :£10 × [(1/3 + 2) × (5/2 + 2) × (6/4 + 2) × (1/1 + 2) − 1 − [(1/3 + 1) + (5/2 + 1) + (6/4 + 1) + (1/1 + 1) = £999.16 In effect, the bet has been calculated as a Lucky 15 minus the singles. Note that the total returns value of £999.16 is a penny higher than the previously calculated value as this quicker method only involves rounding the final answer, and not rounding at each individual step. In algebraic terms the OM for the Yankee bet is given by: :OM = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)(d + 1) − 1 − (a + b + c + d) In the days before software became available for use by bookmakers and those settling bets in Licensed Betting Offices (LBOs) this method was virtually de rigueur for saving time and avoiding the multiple repetitious calculations necessary in settling bets of the full cover type. Settling other types of winning bets Up and down :Returns (£20 single at 7-2 ATC £20 single at 15-8) = £20 × 7/2 + £20 × (15/8 + 1) = £127.50 :Returns (£20 single at 15-8 ATC £20 single at 7-2) = £20 × 15/8 + £20 × (7/2 + 1) = £127.50 :Total returns = £255.00 :Note: This is the same as two £20 single bets at twice the odds; i.e. £20 singles at 7-1 and 15-4 and is the preferred manual way of calculating the bet. :Returns (£10 single at 5-1 ATC £10 single on 'loser') = £10 × 5/1 = £50 :Note: This calculation of a bet where the stake is not returned is called \\"receiving the odds to the stake\\" on the winner; in this case receiving the odds to £10 (on the 5-1 winner). Round Robin A Round Robin with 3 winners is calculated as a Trixie plus three Up and Down bets with 2 winners in each. A Round Robin with 2 winners is calculated as a double plus one Up and Down bet with 2 winners plus two Up and Down bets with 1 winner in each. A Round Robin with 1 winner is calculated as two Up and Down bets with one winner in each. Flag and Super Flag bets may be calculated in a similar manner as above using the appropriate full cover bet (if sufficient winners) together with the required number of 2 winner- and 1 winner Up and Down bets. Note: Expert bet settlers before the introduction of bet-settling software would have invariably used an algebraic- type method together with a simple calculator to determine the return on a bet (see below). Algebraic interpretation If a, b, c, d... represent the decimal odds, i.e. (fractional odds + 1), then an 'odds multiplier' OM can be calculated algebraically by multiplying the expressions (a + 1), (b + 1), (c + 1)... etc. together in the required manner and adding or subtracting additional components. If required, (decimal odds + 1) may be replaced by (fractional odds + 2). =Examples= *OM (2 winners) = (2a − 1) + (2b − 1) = 2(a + b − 1) *OM (1 winner) = a − 1 *OM (3 winners) = (a + 1) × (b + 1) × (c + 1) − 1 − (a + b + c) + 2 × [(a + b − 1) + (a + c − 1) + (b + c − 1)] = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) + 3(a + b + c) − 7 *OM (2 winners) = (a + 1) × (b + 1) − 1 − (a + b) + 2 × (a + b − 1) + (a − 1) + (b − 1) = (a + 1)(b + 1) + 2(a + b) − 5 or more simply as OM = ab + 3(a + b) − 4 *OM (1 winner) = 2 × (a − 1) = 2(a − 1) *OM (4 winners) = (a + 1) × (b + 1) × (c + 1) × (d + 1) − 1 − (a + b + c + d) + 2 × [(a + b − 1) + (a + c − 1) + (a + d − 1) + (b + c − 1) + (b + d − 1) + (c + d − 1)] = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)(d + 1) + 5(a + b + c + d) − 13 *OM (3 winners) = (a + 1) × (b + 1) × (c + 1) − 1 − (a + b + c) + 2 × [(a + b − 1) + (a + c − 1) + (b + c − 1)] + (a − 1) + (b − 1) + (c − 1) = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) + 4(a + b + c) − 10 *OM (2 winners) = (a + 1) × (b + 1) − 1 − (a + b) + 2 × (a + b − 1) + 2 × [(a − 1) + (b − 1)] = (a + 1)(b + 1) + 3(a + b) − 7 or more simply as OM = ab + 4(a + b) − 6 *OM (1 winner) = 3 × (a − 1) = 3(a − 1) See also *Statistical association football predictions *Glossary of bets offered by UK bookmakers Notes References .

He was head of Brymbo Steelworks, Wrexham. He was co-founder of Beyer-Peacock, with Charles Beyer, and Richard Peacock. His son Sir Henry Beyer Robertson was knighted by Queen Victoria for the achievements of his father. Biography The son of Duncan Robertson, he was born in Banff, Aberdeenshire on 16 January 1816, and educated at King's College, Aberdeen University, and graduated M.A. He was initially to enter the ministry but turned to engineering. =Career= He started as a railway contractor securing some contracts at Port Glasgow, under Joseph Locke. On the offer of a Scottish bank to invest in the North Wales mineral district in 1842, Robertson ventured south, and purchased Brymbo Iron works and colliery, formerly owned by John Wilkinson. Robertson decided for the venture to succeed he needed to build a railway from Brymbo to Connah's Quay to export the coal and iron. This became the North Wales Mineral Railway, which runs from Wrexham to Chester, with a branch to Brymbo. At Chester he had access to the Birkenhead Joint Railway and its associated docks.

In 1885 he introduced steel-making. Following his death in 1889, his son Sir Henry Beyer Robertson took over and would later (1930s) rescue the plant from bankruptcy following the great depression, and install new blast furnaces.  Coal and mineral companies  Robertson's mining and related interests included: *Brymbo Iron and Coal Company (Gatewen and Plaspower collieries), Wrexham *Broughton and Plaspower Coal Company *Ruabon Coal and Coal and Coke Company. Formed in 1865 with Henry Dennis and Sir Daniel Gooch (who was then chairman of the Great Western Railway). This enabled the company to have preferential rates to transport the coal. *Minera Lime Company (to supply the ironworks) *Brymbo Waterworks  Charles Beyer  Robertson was co- founder in 1854 of Beyer, Peacock and Co with Charles Beyer and Richard Peacock. Based at Gorton Foundry, in Gorton, Manchester, it would become one of the world's leading locomotive manufacturers. Robertson knew Beyer because he supplied some of the locomotives to his railways. He was a sleeping partner but his connections with the Great Western Railway proved useful in securing orders. On the recommendation of Thomas Brassey, Robertson provided the loan, when the original loan of banker Charles Geach fell through. Robertson and Beyer subsequently became close friends for life; Beyer was godfather of Robertson's daughter in 1854 and of his son Sir Henry Beyer Robertson ten years later.  Political career He served as Liberal MP for Shrewsbury from 1862 to 1865 and from 1874 to 1885, and Merioneth from 1885 to 1886, resigning his seat as a result of his opposition to Gladstone's Home Rule Bill.

Built in 1928–1930, it was one of several Art Deco-style telecommunications buildings designed by Ralph Thomas Walker of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker in the early 20th century. 60 Hudson Street spans the entire block between Hudson Street, Thomas Street, Worth Street, and West Broadway. 60 Hudson Street was initially the headquarters of Western Union, and its construction was commissioned by Western Union president Newcomb Carlton. The building was described as the world's largest telegraph building upon its opening, and served as the combined headquarters for all of Western Union's divisions, which were scattered across New York City prior to the building's completion. Though Western Union relocated elsewhere in 1973, its former headquarters remains a communications center, and since the late 20th century, has housed a colocation center, making it one of the most important Internet hubs in the world. 60 Hudson Street's design shows the influence of Dutch and German Expressionism, with Art Deco detailing. The building's shape features asymmetrical massing and numerous setbacks. The brick facade utilizes a gradient color scheme with nineteen distinct hues, moving from darker shades to lighter ones as the building rises, and several ornate entrances at ground level lead to a barrel-vaulted brick lobby. The exterior and lobby were designated as official New York City landmarks in 1991.  Design  60 Hudson Street is tall and contains 24 stories. It occupies a trapezoidal plot measuring on Hudson Street to the west, on West Broadway to the east, on Thomas Street to the south, and on Worth Street to the north. The Worth and Thomas Street sides are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the West Broadway side. The Hudson Street side runs diagonally, intersecting both Worth and Thomas Streets. The building was designed by Ralph Walker of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker in the Art Deco style. 60 Hudson Street was the third Art Deco building in the New York City area that Walker designed, after the Barclay–Vesey Building (1927) and New Jersey Bell Headquarters Building (1929); it was followed by 1 Wall Street (1931) and 32 Avenue of the Americas (1932), as well as telephone buildings in Upstate New York. Within the New York City area, McKenzie, Voorhees & Gmelin designed numerous other buildings for AT&T; or its affiliates during the same time span. 60 Hudson Street was one of several technologically advanced headquarters erected in the mid-20th century for communications and utility companies in the U.S. Unlike the AT&T; buildings, 60 Hudson Street lacks a unified iconography in its ornamentation. = Form = Seen from the northwest corner, near Hudson and Worth Streets 60 Hudson Street contains numerous setbacks on its exterior. Though setbacks in New York City skyscrapers were mandated by the 1916 Zoning Resolution in order to allow light and air to reach the streets below, they later became a defining feature of the Art Deco style. 60 Hudson Street's massing mostly uses rectangular shapes in spite of its trapezoid-shaped lot. This may have been a response to architecture critic Lewis Mumford's previous criticism of the Barclay–Vesey Building's shape; that building had been shaped around its parallelogram-shaped lot, which Mumford had described as an \\"annoying defect\\". Walker subsequently wrote that Mumford's criticism made him realize \\"a building could take its own form regardless of the land below\\". On the Hudson Street elevation—the only side that is not perpendicular to any of the others—there is a two-story screen, behind which rise three rectangular slabs. The northern, center, and southern slabs are respectively 15, 21, and 19 stories tall. By contrast, the West Broadway elevation, which is perpendicular to both Thomas and Worth Streets, is symmetrical, with the top floors behind a central slab. Along the outer sections of the West Broadway facade, the setbacks are located at the 13th, 15th, 19th, and 22nd stories; the center section contains projecting dormers that rise an additional story above the previous setback, except at the 22nd floor. The series of setbacks on Thomas and Worth Streets are largely symmetrical, and are continuations of the setbacks on the outer edges of the West Broadway elevation. There are several projecting dormers along the setbacks near the western (Hudson Street) ends of both facades. 60 Hudson Street's form was also influenced by its interior use, as it was a \\"hybrid building\\" that contained offices along with mechanical equipment. There were numerous functions that did not necessitate sunlight and could operate using artificial light, such as the central operating system and the mechanical space, which was placed inside the building's core. The office space, conversely, was placed on the exterior walls, so 60 Hudson Street did not require light courts that were as extensive as in nearby buildings. = Facade = To cover the interior steel frame, Walker designed the facade with a grid of accented vertical piers, contrasting with horizontal spandrels. This emphasized the vertical lines of the building, and combined with the setbacks, created an appearance of cascades. A brick facade was used for 60 Hudson Street and for Walker's other communications buildings, since he preferred the material for its texture and its flexibility in color combinations. The ornamentation on the facade was made almost entirely of brick, concentrated around the base, as well as on the parapets on each setback (which were largely removed by the 1990s). This was likely influenced by Dutch and German Expressionism, as well as Walker's preference for \\"unity and harmony\\", his dislike of terracotta-on-brick ornamentation, and his observation that stone could change color within a short time. It is unclear who created the brick on the facade. The bricks were tinted in various tones of red, arranged in a gradient, inspired by Louis Sullivan's use of \\"tapestry brick\\" in different hues. 60 Hudson Street was one of the first structures to use bricks in this manner. According to Walker, this was inspired by Western Union's inclination toward using a distinctive design for the building. There are 19 different shades of brick used in the building, which were created by baking the bricks in a kiln run under varying circumstances. The bricks were arranged so that the base has a facade of dark bricks, while the top stories were clad with lighter bricks. Dark bricks at the top and light bricks at the base were used to create contrasts on the facade. Though the facade mostly used brick in red and yellow hues, there were also bricks in very dark blue and purple hues. The facade served to give emphasis to the building's shape: the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City observed that 60 Hudson Street resembles \\"a huge red rock projecting out of the city\\".  Base  The base comprises the ground story and the second story. The lowest section of the facade is composed of three courses of pink granite, while the brick facade rises above that. Around the doors and windows, the brickwork is arranged similar to curtains. The critic Paul T. Frankl stated that designs like that of 60 Hudson Street were effective, comparing them to \\"brick tapestries hung from the sky\\". Most ornamentation is made of brick, though the friezes, window frames, and doorways are made of bronze. On the Hudson Street side, the facade forms a two-story \\"screen\\", behind which rise the upper stories. The main entrance archway is in the center of this \\"screen\\", near the intersection with Jay Street. It consists of five bronze doors beneath a bronze lintel, as well as a glazed window above the doors, which is subdivided by diagonal muntins. The other archways on Hudson Street include storefronts on the ground level, and curtain-shaped windows with vertical muntins on the second story. A smaller doorway faces the corner of Hudson and Worth Streets, on the northwest side of the plot. The facade on West Broadway is designed similarly to the \\"screen\\" on the Hudson Street side. There is a centrally positioned entrance with five doors, a bronze lintel, and a glazed window with diagonal muntins. Three storefronts are located to either side of the doorway on West Broadway; at the second story, two of these storefronts contain curtain-shaped windows, and the third contains a pair of sash windows set between vertical brick piers. On the Worth Street facade, there are storefront windows at either end. The central section of the Worth Street facade contains triple-hung windows, which concealed an auditorium inside. On Thomas Street, there are two storefront windows on the easternmost bays, as well as two double-height loading docks. The remaining bays on Thomas Street contain rectangular windows or ventilation grates, which are set between brick piers.  Upper stories  The rest of 60 Hudson Street's facade is modeled in a mostly consistent format. On Hudson Street, Walker designed the facade with a pattern of wide and narrow piers that alternate. On the other facades, the piers were largely flat against the rest of the facade, except behind the setbacks at the upper levels, where the piers were more prominent and designed similar to buttresses. At several locations on the north and south facades, there were windowless bays that concealed stairways behind them. On the Worth Street side, the center window openings on the third floor are filled with copper chevron-shaped louvers. = Interior = When he designed the Barclay-Vesey Building, Walker had believed that it should serve \\"as a machine which had definite functions to perform for the benefit of its occupants.\\" In a similar manner, 60 Hudson Street was described as \\"housing the production of the service which this company renders\\". As with his previous commissions, Walker designed the interior in a similar style to the exterior, at a time when many buildings were being designed with modern-styled exteriors and historically-styled interiors. In contrast to the complex stone designs of his previous commissions, the ornamental program at 60 Hudson Street is more subdued and exclusively uses brick. The interior spaces of 60 Hudson Street cover almost .  Lobby  The lobby is a corridor that extends west–east between Hudson Street and West Broadway. It is usually not accessible to the public. The corridor is designed similar to the nave of a church, with a barrel-vaulted brick ceiling. Extending off this corridor are two elevator banks, one on each side, as well as numerous additional doorways to service areas, stairwells, and the storefronts at each of the building's four corners. Also on the south side are a telephone alcove; an entrance to the lobby outside the building's former auditorium; and a passageway to the former cafeteria, Small vestibules separate the main corridor from Hudson Street and West Broadway. On Hudson Street, between the vestibule and the main hall, is a wide entrance hall. This space contains plaster on the upper portions of its walls, as well as an arched ceiling supported by octagonal brick piers. Unlike most other Art Deco lobbies of the time, which incorporated traditional motifs with modern materials, 60 Hudson Street's lobby largely uses a modern brick design. The lobby is clad largely in brick and tile, though the floors are made of terrazzo tile and the bottoms of the walls are clad with red granite. A Western Union publication described the lobby as the \\"only all-brick corridor in any office building in America\\". Many elements of the facade were also used in the lobby, such as the brick reliefs and chevrons; curtain-shaped thresholds and doorways; use of bronze trim; and the mailboxes and doors, which are designed in a style reminiscent of the exterior setbacks. The use of interior brick is inspired not only by Sullivan's \\"brick tapestries\\", but also by designs of brick halls created by Peter Behrens, Barry Byrne, and Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint. The tops of the walls contain curved covings, giving the appearance that the walls and ceilings have been blended together. Additionally, the lobby contains bronze and brick furnishings such as lampposts and signage.  Other interior spaces  The second floor contained a gymnasium, a library, and a school for the education of messengers, while the upper floors contained mechanical shops, offices, and equipment rooms.60 Hudson Street , Retired Western Union Employees Association. Accessed October 13, 2007. The ninth floor included laboratories for the company, and the 24th floor served as a \\"presidential suite\\". The eleventh through fifteenth floors were devoted to facilities for Western Union's different modes of communication: simplex printers, multiplex transmitters, marine and stock ticker tapes, Morse code equipment, and telephone equipment. Four additional floors were set aside for the possible future expansion of these facilities. This reinforced 60 Hudson Street's role as \\"the heart of a nerve system of wires and cables reaching to every corner of the nation and the world.\\" The building featured of cable and of conduits, as well as a power plant. Pneumatic tubes led from 60 Hudson Street to twenty- five branch offices in Lower and Midtown Manhattan, allowing for the easy transport of pneumatic tube mail in the city. These tubes were later repurposed to hold wires for the Internet companies that occupied the building. History = Context and planning = Upper stories, seen from a few blocks away Western Union, founded in 1851, became a major provider of telegraph services in the late 19th century. In 1875, it built the Western Union Telegraph Building at 195 Broadway between Dey Street and Fulton Street. Western Union was acquired by AT&T; in 1909, and the next year, AT&T; revealed plans to improve Western Union's offices \\"for the accommodation of the public and the welfare\\" of workers. William W. Bosworth was commissioned to design a new headquarters on the same site, the present 195 Broadway, which was completed in 1916. The newer Broadway building came to be mainly associated with AT&T;, to the extent that by the 1920s, Western Union did not have a building with which its headquarters was mainly associated. Simultaneously, work proceeded on 24 Walker Street, a shared-operations building erected five blocks north on the current 32 Avenue of the Americas site in 1911–1914. AT&T;, under indictment of the Sherman Act, sold its shares in Western Union in 1913 due to the threat of antitrust action. Under the tenure of Western Union president Newcomb Carlton, the company's operations grew and its equipment was upgraded to modern standards. = Construction = Western Union began land acquisition at the site of 60 Hudson Street in 1924, ultimately buying up the whole block between Worth, Hudson, and Thomas Streets and West Broadway. The site was located close to 24 Walker Street, as well as the company's major clients in Lower Manhattan: the American Stock Exchange at their Trinity Place building, the New York Cotton Exchange, the New York Produce Exchange, and the ticker service on Wall Street. It was projected that the Western Union Building's completion would raise land values along Worth Street. In May 1928, Western Union filed construction plans for the Hudson Street site. Work started in August 1928, and excavations started the following month. At the time of the site's official groundbreaking, the building was expected to be completed in January 1930. Construction was to take two years because of the complexities of the project: the building was required to be fireproof and resistant to theft and outside interference, while the cable and conduit systems were supposed to handle 100 million messages yearly. The construction process also involved a deadly incident in April 1929 when of steel girders fell from the 22nd floor, killing four workers and injuring 11 more. Four individuals were indicted on manslaughter charges relating to the incident, but were later released, since the deaths were deemed a result of an accidental fuse blowout that could have happened at any time. = Western Union years = Western Union started moving from 195 Broadway in August 1930. Two months later, on October 5, the telegraph lines from 24 Walker Street were \\"cut over\\" to 60 Hudson Street, with the help of 3,000 men. Telegraph service was maintained throughout the twelve-hour \\"cut over\\" period, and so this was considered a large engineering achievement for the time. Just before the building's opening, Carlton protested against plans to demolish the adjacent Sixth Avenue elevated railroad in preparation for the construction of nearby subway lines, stating that it would inconvenience Western Union employees; the line ultimately remained open until 1938. The Western Union Building was a premier nexus of worldwide communications during the heyday of the telegraph and was called the \\"Telegraph Capitol of America\\". When 60 Hudson Street was Western Union's headquarters, equipment for communications was installed on the roof. The equipment was frequently updated to use the most modern technology, making the building desirable to communications companies. In 1948, Western Union sold 60 Hudson Street to a Chicago-based company for $12.5 million, subsequently leasing back the structure. The proceeds from the sale would be used to pay back long-term debt and pay for modernization of the company's equipment. Western Union moved its headquarters to Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, in 1973, though it continued to occupy much of 60 Hudson Street until 1983, when a second sublease was made. Afterward, Western Union gradually moved out of its space. 60 Hudson Street remained a major telecommunications hub, as the wires of six long- distance communications providers converged under the building. = Internet hub and offices = 60 Hudson Street (left); 33 Thomas Street, also known as the AT&T; Long Lines Building, is at right After Western Union left, 60 Hudson Street was converted into a colocation center and grew into one of the most important internet hubs in the world. Hundreds of telecommunications companies interconnect their respective internet networks (known as peering) as well as conventional TDM traffic through numerous meet-me rooms and optical and electrical lines placed throughout the building. Many data center colocation providers are tenants in the building. Epsilon Telecommunications, one such company, has built optical and electrical cabling facilities throughout the building since 1997. Various data centers including Epsilon, Equinix, Digital Realty, and zColo house internet and telecommunications providers for the purpose of collocating high capacity transport equipment used to terminate traffic both inbound and outbound with each other. The exteriors and ground- floor lobbies of 60 Hudson Street and two other telecommunications buildings were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1991. In addition, after Western Union moved out of 60 Hudson Street, some of the space was occupied by city and state agencies. This included the New York City Department of Correction, which moved there in 2002. However, this use was relatively short-lived, as the city's departments of buildings and correction left 60 Hudson Street in 2010, and the space was subsequently used by internet providers. There has been some controversy about the usage of 60 Hudson Street as a colocation building. Residents of the surrounding neighborhood complained in 1999 that the cooling structures on the building were too loud. 60 Hudson Street's then-owners, Hudson Telegraph Associates, agreed to mitigate noise coming from the building. In 2006, a New York City panel approved the storage of nearly 2,000 gallons (7,500 liters) of diesel fuel on six floors of the building, part of some 80,000 gallons (300,000 liters) of fuel oil stored in the building. Community opposition had been raised regarding concerns that the presence of the fuel oil posed a fire hazard that could result in a catastrophic failure of the building. 60 Hudson Street underwent some renovations starting in 2015.

It stands for \\"Automating Production of Cross Media Content for Multi-channel Distribution\\". Now it is distributed as a framework, and is still being maintained and improved. A large part of the framework is under open source licensing. The AXMEDIS framework includes a set of tools, models, test cases, documents, etc. supporting the production and distribution of cross media content.  Summary  The AXMEDIS framework supports the whole content production 'food chain' for cross media content creation, aggregation, adaptation, repurposing, protection and multichannel distribution, with a strong focus on automation. The market for digital content is rapidly changing. Users are becoming more interested in using more interactive and intelligent content, that example can: * include/describe/package several kinds of media (audio, video, games, documents, etc.), reproducing in a single digital object the interactivity and much more powerful entertainment capabilities than DVDs; * provide enhanced interactivity such as navigating and selecting content elements to be played, making queries into the content elements, reacting to user commands and changes, providing annotations, etc.; * be exchanged and distributed among different devices/tools: PC, mobiles, smart-phones, STB/PVR, HDR, PDA, game station, etc.; * be obtained from several different interoperable distribution channels based on Internet, P2P, wireless mobile, satellite and/or terrestrial networks, etc.; * change content behaviour according to the context and/or to the user profiles, context, device capabilities, etc.; * protect and manage the IPR, that means that the content format has to support some DRM model and that this support a set of business models, for example: renting, pay per play, subscription, advertising, etc.; * be stored in media centres to be redistributed to other devices; * present some autonomy of control, asking to the user to provide information and data; * provide autonomous capabilities for example to create an electronic guide, to issues content usage licenses, ask at the user to provide content, etc.; * be personally produced at home and/or shared in the network. These new forms of content and content usages can be fully exploited for digital content distribution, and are opening paths for a larger set of new applications and markets beyond the limitations of the physical media. With AXMEDIS the combinations of digital content formats and digital distribution channels are creating new applications including: user content, shared content, IPTV, DVB, VOD, POD, WEBTV, etc., for PC, PDA, mobiles and STB/PVR. Recent distribution models have been enabled by a set of new technologies grounded on content formats, content processing and adaptation capabilities, content protection models and solutions, hardware capabilities, and new solutions for Digital Rights Management, DRM.  Aims  According to the official AXMEDIS website the main aims are to: * reduce the costs of cross media (Multi-media) production and distribution * search for and integrate objects and components through a query support system * manage and monitor distribution These objectives are being pursued by integrating research results, algorithms and tools. AXMEDIS is a powerful cross media format, in which any kind of content can be hosted for its direct access. It has been derived extending MPEG-21 format with a powerful binary file format based on ISOMEDIA, and several metadata, descriptors and tools.  Objects and their file format  An Axmedis object is an MPEG-21 multimedia object which can virtually contain any kind of multimedia resource, metadata and rights- related information supporting the MPEG-21 \\"Rights Expression Language\\" (REL). AXMEDIS content format supports from simple files to complex collections of multimedia for a large range of applications, from business to business to personal and/or global scale production, protection and distribution, with and without DRM. AXMEDIS format and solution can be used: * for describing and/or packing and may be protected any kind of digital content, with standard, custom and extended metadata; * for cultural heritage valorisation and distribution, educational and infotainment content: lessons, coursewares; * for content distribution: VOD, IPTV, WEBTV, etc.; * for modelling content for PC, PDA, P2P, Kiosks and mobiles with interactive parts; * as intelligent content having the possibility of defining the internal business model and actions on the content itself, dynamic modelling of content behaviour; * as interchange content format, wrapping any kind of files, including SMIL, HTML, FLASH, MXF, etc., for safer audio/visual sharing; * for sharing content among B2B actors of the value chain, in protected and non-protected versions; * for leisure and entertainment content: video, TV, games, etc.; * for distributing and protecting governmental, military, clinical information; * for packaging, protecting and distributing newsML; * for creating audio guides for PDA and mobiles: windows mobile and iPhone * for producing content with advertising (customised and/or real time personalised advertising inside the package or linked to outside); * for producing and delivering personalised content inside the package or linked to outside; * for managing personally produced content from final users and customers; * to provide multichannel experience and distribution: different content on different channels at the same time for multichannel experience of the user. The above-mentioned scenarios and many others can be realised thanks to AXMEDIS technology and tools of: AXMEDIS content format, DRM, controlled P2P, and Content Processing.  Main Tools  The AXMEDIS framework consists of a set of tools, accessible also in source code, plus documentation, test cases, specification, content for validation, workflow procedures, examples, grid rules, etc. Following is a (non exhaustive) overview of major tools. These tools enable the manual editing of AXMEDIS MPEG-21 objects, while the automated production can be performed by using AXCP tools. These tools are needed to play axmedis cross media objects (when they are in clean and/or protected). There are various flavours of the players for different devices for PC (standalone, browser plug-in, skinned), mobile, PDA, set top box. * PC Windows XP and Vista players: capable of executing many video and audio formats and SMIL, HTML, MPEG-4, video, audio, documents, images, etc., and JavaScript methods. AXMEDIS PC player may provide different skin; Most of the AXMEDIS players can be customised in terms of GUI and functionalities. AXMEDIS Skin based player can be easily customised by a designer changing the graphical look and feel. * Active X for IE player to integrate the player into WEB pages and other applications, for example .NET based; See the CrossMedia Finder of AXMEDIS as example.http://mobmed.axmedis.org * Plugin for Mozilla FireFox and other internet browsers. * PDA Windows Mobile 5 and 6 player, supporting: SMIL, HTML, MPEG-4, video, audio, documents, images, etc.; * STB/PVR player based on (i) Linux, supporting audio visual, SMIL and HTML and on (ii) Kreatel STB; * Pure java player for mobiles, supporting: MPEG-21, SMIL, images and audio visual; = Content Processing, AXCP = These tools are used for the automatic creation, aggregation, processing and distribution of multimedia content with the AXMEDIS format. This is done via scripts written in enhanced JavaScript. These tools include a JavaScript Integrated development environment (IDE), a scheduler and a GRID environment, and a visual designer for AXCP JS rules. AXMEDIS AXCP can be used to automate your content production, protection and distribution as stated above and in more details into the AXCP Technical Note. solution and tools is presently free of charge for any no profit institution. In addition, the full source code is provided to those institutions that are interested to join the development community of the AXCP. The AXCP offers functionalities to support and set up integrated activities of: * content Ingestion and gathering, database management, crawling, indexing, archiving, gathering from OAI (see OAI-PMH), etc.; * query, download and publication on social networks: YouTube, Flickr, XMF, mobile medicine; * content storage and retrieval, active querying; * content processing, repurposing, adaptation, transmoding, transcoding for text, docs, images, audio, video, multimedia, XML, SMIL, HTML, styles, MXF, newsML, MPEG-4, MPEG-21, etc.; * metadata repurposing, adaptation, transcoding, integration, enrichment, validation; * content descriptors, extraction and comparison, fingerprint, MPEG-7, MPEG-21, etc.; * content composition, formatting, layout, styling; * communication with databases, FTP, HTTP, P2P and distribution servers via several protocols; * content packaging: MPEG-21, MXF, OMA, newsML, ZIP, etc.; * content protection via several algorithms; * content DRM with MPEG-21 and OMA, with tracking and reporting rights exploitation; * content licensing, licensing the production of licenses; * content publication and distribution toward multiple channels; * workflow management integration with BizTalk and OpenFlow; * user management: registration, licensing, profiling, advertising. = P2P: AXEPTool = The AXEPTool is a BitTorrent based legal P2P client for sharing AXMEDIS content.

Western Seminary also has online-only degrees and programs and provides non-credit classes through the Center for Leadership Development. History Armstrong Hall at the Portland campus Portland Baptist Bible Institute was organized in the winter of 1925 through the work of Walter B. Hinson. In the following year, further efforts were begun to establish a graduate-level seminary to provide a theological education of greater depth in the Northwestern United States. The Western Baptist Theological Seminary was officially dedicated on October 4, 1927. The board acquired the Philip Buehner House, now Armstrong Hall, and of land on the west slope of Portland's Mt. Tabor in 1944. Additional structures were built and classes convened at the new site in the fall of that year. The Portland campus continues to operate at this site at the crest of the Hawthorne District. The Western Baptist Theological Seminary became Western Seminary. Western Seminary has opened several extension campus locations in the Western United States. The first branch campus was launched in San Jose, California in 1986, followed by another in Phoenix, Arizona in 1988. A Sacramento, California campus was opened in 1991, as was the former Seattle, Washington campus in 1992. The Phoenix campus has become an independent seminary, Phoenix Seminary. Western Seminary's former Seattle campus is now The Seattle School of Theology & Psychology (formerly Mars Hill Graduate School). Western's presidents have been reputable leaders in theological education, including Earl D. Radmacher (1965–1989) and Bert Downs (1998–2008). The current president is Randal Roberts (starting in 2008). Dr. Earl Radmacher became president of Western Seminary in 1965, at age 34, the youngest seminary president in the country, leading a school of 90 students. Six years of effort recruiting faculty and students saw the student body increase to 600 students, and Dr. Radmacher led the institution as its president for a total of 25 years. Western has developed many solutions to help non-residential students complete their coursework. Western was one of the earliest institutions to offer the Doctor of Ministry degree, with modular scheduling for easy out of state access. In 1981, Western began an online-only program that served hundreds of students per year in study centers across America and overseas through interactive video curriculum. In adapting courses to DVD and online streaming formats, the Western Seminary Online Campus offers distance learning courses and programs. In 2005, Western expanded its training sites along the west coast by establishing learning cohorts in such cities as Seattle and Richland, Washington, Reno, Nevada and Bakersfield, California. In 2010, the San Jose, California campus relocated to Santa Clara, California. In 2013, Western Seminary changed the name of its online learning department to Western Seminary Online Campus (formerly \\"Center for Lifelong Learning\\") as it began to offer its fully online degree program. In 2014, the seminary launched a Seattle Teaching Site in Bellevue, Washington to offer classes to the Puget Sound Area. This site was closed in 2020 and replaced by a \\"pop-up\\" model. The Sacramento, California campus relocated to a new facility in the Sacramento community of Rocklin, California. In 2016, the San Jose, California campus relocated to Milpitas, California. As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Portland seminary received between $1 million and $2 million in federally backed small business loan from Columbia State Bank as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The company stated it would allow them to retain an undefined number of jobs. Academics Western Seminary offers the Master of Arts, Master of Divinity, and Master of Theology degrees. It also offers the Doctor of Intercultural Studies, Doctor of Ministry, and Doctor of Education degrees as well as non-credit programs. =Theology and philosophy of ministry= Western Seminary is dedicated to \\"gospel-centered transformation.\\" The seminary centers all learning and experience - in and out of the classroom - on the gospel. Though Western Seminary students come from a large number of Christian denominations and non-denominational churches, the faculty teaches a conservative and evangelical Christian doctrine, with a philosophy of ministry in and alongside the church. Western Seminary regards the Bible as the infallible and inerrant word of God. Accreditation Western Seminary is accredited to award master's and doctorate degrees by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) and is an accredited member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS). The seminary is also a partner with Jerusalem University College in Jerusalem, Israel, as well as a charter member of the Institute of Theological Studies (ITS). Publications Western Magazine is a print publication produced semi- annually by Western Seminary and is sent to alumni, supporters, and friends of the Seminary. 'Renewal' is an electronic newsletter published by Western Seminary and sent to alumni, supporters, and friends of the Seminary. 'Transformed' is a blog composed by faculty and alumni of Western Seminary, which was launched in October 2011 to help initiate renewal to the Christian Church community. Articles address a variety of disciplines, including the Bible, theology, ministry practice, leadership, discipleship, culture and reviews of various media that pertain to Christian living. The Spurgeon Fellowship Journal was inaugurated in October 2007 in an effort \\"to equip pastors to bring classic pastoral wisdom to bear upon modern ministry challenges.\\" The journal is published online three times a year, focusing each edition on one of three areas: The Pastoral Identity, The Pastoral Task and the Pastoral Confession. Journal articles are contributed by Western Seminary faculty, as well as theologians and pastors around the country. Notable alumni *Craig A.

Wagenschein is most well known for his promotion of open learning techniques. He emphasised the importance of teaching students to understand and not simply learn knowledge for the sake of it. As such he was one of precursors of modern teaching techniques such as constructivism, inquiry-based science, and inquiry learning. His work is little known of in the English speaking world and has been little translated. Despite this he sets the foundation for modern open learning techniques, which mirrors the work of English speaking science educationists such as John Dewey. The Wagenschein Effect Wagenschein discovered that even highly educated people, and even students of physics, could not provide a realistic or simple explanation for even the most basic physical phenomena, despite being well qualified to do so, or being able to do so with the use of complicated equations or difficult to understand language. One example of this being students asked to explain why the moon's phases occurred in the order that they did. Another example being students being unable to explain in simply easy to understand language how to describe the speed at which objects fall. This phenomenon became known as The Wagenschein Effect. The Wagenschein effect is most prominent when people are unable to understand what appears to be basic scientific knowledge, hedged in scientific or overcomplicated language.

Physiomics employs bioinformatics to construct networks of physiological features that are associated with genes, proteins and their networks. A few of the methods for determining individual relationships between the DNA sequence and physiological function include metabolic pathway engineering and RNAi analysis. The relationships derived from methods such as these are organized and processed computationally to form distinct networks. Computer models use these experimentally determined networks to develop further predictions of gene function.  History  Physiomics arose from the imbalance between the amount of data being generated by genome projects and the technological ability to analyze the data on a large scale. As technologies such as high- throughput sequencing were being used to generate large amounts of genomic data, effective methods needed to be designed to experimentally interpret and computationally organize this data. Science can be illustrated as a cycle linking knowledge to observations. In the post-genomic era, the ability of computational methods to aid in this observation became evident. This cycle, aided by computer models, is the basis for bioinformatics and, thus, physiomics. =Physiome projects= In 1993, the International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) in Australia presented a physiome project with the purpose of providing a quantitative description of physiological dynamics and functional behavior of the intact organism. The Physiome Project became a major focus of the IUPS in 2001. The National Simulation Resource Physiome Project is a North American project at The University of Washington. The key elements of the NSR Project are the databasing of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological information on humans and other organisms and integration through computational modeling. Other North American projects include the Biological Network Modeling Center at the California Institute of Technology, the National Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling at The University of Connecticut, and the NIH Center for Integrative Biomedical Computing at The University of Utah. Research applications There are many different possible applications of physiomics, each requiring different computational models or the combined use of several different models. Examples of such applications include a three dimensional model for tumor growth, the modelling of biological pattern formation, a mathematical model for the formation of stretch marks in humans, and predictive algorithms for the growth of viral infections within insect hosts.H.

Thorne. The region extends from Kodiak Island in Alaska to the San Francisco Bay Area and Sierra Nevada in California. The Vancouverian Province comprises the coastal part of the region for its entire length, including the Pacific Coast Ranges, and the Rocky Mountain Province includes the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges. There are no endemic plant families in the region but many endemic genera and species. Geography The region spans from Kodiak Island of Alaska approximately to the San Francisco Bay Area and Sierra Nevada of California, running between the shore of the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Great Plains on the east, along the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges. It is bordered by the Canadian Province of the Circumboreal Region in the north, by the North American Prairies Province of the North American Atlantic Region in the east and by the Californian Province of the Madrean Region in the south. The borders with the Canadian and Californian Provinces are vague. Flora Although the Rocky Mountain Region has no endemic vascular plant families and only one endemic Marchantiophyta family (Gyrothyraceae), it has many endemic genera (such as Sidalcea, Luetkea, Whipplea, Vancouveria, Lithophragma, Tellima, Tolmiea, Luina) and numerous endemic species. The genera Arnica, Castilleja, Erigeron, and Lomatium have their major center of diversity here. The region possesses the greatest diversity of conifers in the New World. The remaining wildland of the province is covered mostly by temperate coniferous forests (such as Northern California coastal forests, Maritime Coast Range Ponderosa Pine forests, Klamath-Siskiyou forests, British Columbia mainland coastal forests, Fraser Plateau and Basin complex, Northern Pacific coastal forests) dominated by Pinus ponderosa, Pinus contorta and Pseudotsuga menziesii, as well as the alpine tundra above timberline. The region is subdivided further into the Vancouverian Province and Rocky Mountain Province. The Vancouverian Province comprises the coastal part of the region for its entire length, including the Pacific Coast Ranges. Such plant species and genera as Sequoia sempervirens, Sequoiadendron giganteum, Darlingtonia californica, Vancouveria and Whipplea are endemic to it. The boundary with the Californian Province is not well-defined. The Rocky Mountain Province includes the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges. Due to more heavy glaciation during the Pleistocene, its flora, especially in the north, has a far lower degree of endemism than that of the Vancouverian Province. Much of it is shared with the Canadian Province and the Circumboreal Region in general.Thorne, Robert F. Phytogeography of North America North of Mexico . Flora of North America, Vol. 1, Ch. 6.

Women of high social backgrounds and kisaeng wore them. Like their western contemporaries Koreans considered bigger and heavier wigs to be more aesthetically pleasing. However, there is a record of an incident where a heavy gache wig led to the death of a 13-year-old bride as the heavy wig compromised her neck as she was getting up to greet her father-in-law entering the room. Also due to its costliness, some lower-class families took up to 6–7 years preparing a new gache wig for their new daughter-in-law. http://kdaq.empas.com/knowhow/view.html?num=451347l The gache also flourished in Goryeo, the Three Kingdoms, Balhae, the Gaya confederacy, and Gojoseon. They were decorated with silk objects, gold, jewels, silver, coral, jade, etc. Certain decorations were reserved for royalty. Such was the women's frenzy for the gache that in 1788, King Jeongjo of Joseon prohibited and banned by royal decree the use of gache as they were deemed contrary to Confucian values of reserve and restraint.The Traditional Art of Beauty and Perfume in Ancient Korea by Guest Contributor Pauline http://www.mimifroufrou.com/scentedsalamander/2008/04/beauty_perfume_in_traditional.html In the 19th century, yangban women began to wear jokduri, a small hat that substituted for the gache. However gache still enjoyed vast popularity in kisaeng circles and traditional weddings. Inclusive of its decorations, a gache usually weighs about 3 to 4 kg.

Bannister started promoting music acts through his father-in-law in 1959, organising performances in local dance halls. From 1963 to 1969 he promoted numerous shows at the Pavilion in Bath, England including those by artists such as Gene Vincent, The Rolling Stones, Cream, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Pink Floyd and The Yardbirds.Shawn Perry, \\"Bathing At Knebworth: The Festivals Of The 70s \\", Vintagerock.com. His first festival event was the Bath Festival of Blues which was held on the Rec Ground in the centre of Bath in 1969. The following year, the Festival (now known as the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music) was moved by Bannister to the much larger Bath and West Showground, attracting an audience of between 150,000-200,000. Following his departure from Bath, Bannister founded the Knebworth Festival in 1974 and ran what would be the first of seven consecutive festivals there. These festivals were headlined by The Allman Brothers in 1974, Pink Floyd in 1975, The Rolling Stones and Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1976, Genesis in June 1978, Frank Zappa and Peter Gabriel in September 1978, and Led Zeppelin in 1979 (two concerts). Bannister's concert promotion company, known as Tredoar, was forced into liquidation in the early 1980s due to a financial dispute with the management of Led Zeppelin following the 1979 festival.Dave Lewis (2003), Led Zeppelin: Celebration II: The 'Tight But Loose' Files, London: Omnibus Press. , pp. 54-63. Bannister was noted for his philosophy of \\"always giving the very best value for money\\" by keeping festival tickets at a reasonable cost, whilst also attempting to book the strongest program possible. He specialised in working with American Bands, including Jefferson Airplane, Santana, Johnny Winter, Steppenwolf, Canned Heat, Country Joe, Hot Tuna, The Flock, It's a Beautiful Day and Dr John.Rock Music Memorabilia.com . In addition, he was the European representative for Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, and also Grunt Records, the Jefferson Airplane label which represented such artists as Hot Tuna, Jack Bonus and Black Kangaroo. During the 1990s, Bannister and his wife Wendy ran Parkes Auctions, based at Sandown Park, Surrey, which was later complemented by a two-day classic and collectors car show at the same venue. In 1998 Parkes went out of business. The Sandown Park venue was subsequently taken over by Barons and has no connection with the Bannisters In 2003, Bannister released his autobiography, entitled There Must Be a Better Way, published by Bath Books. He died on cancer on 11 August 2019 at the age of 84.

Responsible for the murders of eight men (including his brother-in-law), he and his gang terrorized the Indian Territory for over two years. Early life Goldsby was born to Sgt. George and Ellen (née Beck) Goldsby on February 8, 1876 at Fort Concho in San Angelo, Texas. Goldsby's father, George Goldsby, was a mulatto from Perry County, Alabama, a sergeant of the Tenth United States Cavalry, and a Buffalo Soldier. Goldsby's mother was a Cherokee freedman, with mixed African, Indian and white ancestry.Weiser, Kathy. \\"Cherokee Bill - Terror of Indian Territory.\\" September 2007. Legends of America.

Accessed 31 January 2009 In a signed deposition on January 29, 1912, George Goldsby stated that he was born in Perry County, Alabama on February 22, 1843. His father was Thornton Goldsby of Selma, Alabama and his mother Hester King, a mulatto, who resided on her own place west of Summerfield Road between Selma and Marion, Alabama. George also stated that he had four brothers and two sisters by the same father and mother: Crawford, Abner, Joseph, Blevens, Mary, and Susie.McRae, Bennie J. \\"Crawford \\"Cherokee Bill\\" Goldsby.\\" Lest We Forget.com Accessed 31 January 2009. George served as a hired servant with a Confederate infantry regiment during the American Civil War. While serving at Gettysburg, he fled and went to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he worked as a teamster in a Union quartermaster unit and subsequently enlisted as a white man in the 21st Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment under the name of George Goosby. (The spelling sometimes varied between Goosbey and Goosley). After the Civil War ended, he returned to the Highland, Illinois. During his last visit, the word was out that he would be captured and lynched for fighting with the Union Army, after which time he departed the area for the Indian Territory. In 1867, Goldsby enlisted in the 10th Cavalry Regiment (Buffalo Soldier) under his proper name, and by 1872 was promoted to sergeant major. After the expiration of his five-year term, he re-enlisted and became first sergeant of Company D, 10th Cavalry. During 1878 (when Crawford Goldsby was two years old), serious trouble began to occur in San Angela (San Angelo), Texas, between the black soldiers and cowboys and hunters. The incident that led to the largest confrontation took place in Morris' saloon. A group of cowboys and hunters ripped the chevrons from the sleeves of a Company D sergeant and the stripes from his pants. The soldier returned to the post and enlisted the aid of fellow soldiers, who armed themselves with carbines and returned to the saloon. A blazing gunfight commenced, resulting in one hunter being killed and two others wounded. One private was killed and another wounded. Texas Ranger Captain G. W. Arrington, along with a party of rangers, went on-post (at Fort Concho) in an attempt to arrest Goldsby, charging that he was responsible for arming the soldiers. Colonel Benjamin Grierson, post commander, challenged the authority of the rangers in a federal fort. Goldsby apparently knew that the Army could not, or would not, protect him away from the post, so he went AWOL. He escaped from Texas into the Indian Territory. Sometime after being abandoned at Fort Concho, Ellen Beck Goldsby moved with her family to Fort Gibson, Indian Territory. She left Crawford Goldsby in the care of an elderly black lady known as \\"Aunty\\" Amanda Foster. She cared for him until he was seven years old, and then he was sent to the Indian school at Cherokee, Kansas. Three years later, he was sent to the Catholic Indian School at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. At the age of 12, he returned home to Fort Gibson. Upon returning home, Goldsby learned that his mother had remarried. After departing Fort Apache, on June 27, 1889, Ellen married William Lynch in Kansas City, Missouri, before proceeding to Fort Gibson. Lynch, born in Waynesville, Ohio, was a private in K Troop, 9th Cavalry. He had served during an earlier enlistment with H Troop, 10th Cavalry. She was the \\"authenticated\\" laundress of the 10th Cavalry, D Troop, and stayed with the unit which gave her rations, transportation, and quarters. She transferred to Fort Davis, Texas, and to Fort Grant, Arizona. She was also with the unit at Fort Apache, Arizona. Goldsby and William Lynch, his stepfather, did not get along. Goldsby began to associate with unsavory characters, drink liquor, and rebel against authority. By the time he was 15, Goldsby had moved in with his sister and her husband, Mose Brown, near Nowata, Oklahoma. However, Mose and his brother-in-law did not get along well, and Goldsby did not stay for long. He went back to Fort Gibson, moved in with a man named Bud Buffington, and began working odd jobs. Life as an outlaw Crawford \\"Cherokee Bill\\" Goldsby was said to be \\"one of the roughest, toughest, meanest outlaws of the Old West\\". Goldsby's life as an outlaw began when he was 18. At a dance in Fort Gibson, Jake Lewis and he had a confrontation over a dispute that Lewis had with one of Goldsby's brothers. A few days later, Goldsby took a six-shooter and shot Lewis. Thinking Lewis was dead, Goldsby went on the run, leaving Fort Gibson and heading for the Creek and Seminole Nations, where he met up with outlaws Jim and Bill Cook, who were mixed-blood Cherokees. During the summer of 1894, the United States government purchased rights to a strip of Cherokee land and agreed to pay out $265.70 to each person who had a legal claim. Since Goldsby and the Cook brothers were part Cherokee, they headed out to Tahlequah, Oklahoma, capitol of the Cherokee Nation, to get their money. At this time, Goldsby was wanted for shooting Lewis, while Jim Cook was wanted on larceny charges. The men did not want to be seen by the authorities, so they stopped at a hotel and restaurant run by an acquaintance, Effie Crittenden. They coaxed her go to Tahlequah to get their money. On her way back, she was followed by Sheriff Ellis Rattling Gourd, who hoped to capture Goldsby and the Cooks. On June 17, 1894, Sheriff Rattling Gourd and his posse got into a gunfight with Goldsby and the Cook brothers. One of Gourd's men, Deputy Sequoyah Houston,ODMP Sequoyah Houston was killed, and Jim Cook was injured. The authorities fled, but later on, when Effie Crittenden was asked if Goldsby had been involved, she stated that it was not Goldsby, but it was Cherokee Bill. After her statement, Crawford Goldsby got the nickname \\"Cherokee Bill\\" and became known as one of the most dangerous men of the Indian Territory. After this, the Cooks and Goldsby formed the Cook Gang and began to terrorize Oklahoma. The gang quickly began robbing banks, stagecoaches, and stores, and were willing to shoot anyone who got in their way. Between August and October, Goldsby and the Cooks went on a crime spree, robbing and mercilessly killing those who stood in their way. During this time, Goldsby's hair started to fall out due to a disease inherited from his grandfather. The disease left him with so little hair on his head, he decided to shave the remainder off.

With the pressure on, the gang split up. Most of the men were captured or killed, but Goldsby managed to escape. When the authorities offered a $1300 reward for the capture of Goldsby, some of his acquaintances came forward and agreed to help. On January 31, 1895, Goldsby was captured by Ike Rogers and Clint Scales in Nowata, Oklahoma;The Dallas daily Chronicle February 1, 1895Credit for Cherokee Bills capture has also been credited to Constables James McBride and Henry Connelly. In December 1894 both officers had to stand trial on a compliant of assault by Cherokee Bill-they were obliged during the arrest to hit him over the head several times when he refused to release his teeth from McBride's thumb. A Jury acquitted both officers.

On April 13, 1895, he was sentenced to death after being tried and convicted for the murder of Ernest Melton. However, his lawyer managed to postpone the execution date. In June 1895 a pistol was discovered in a bucket at the Fort Smith jail; Goldsby claimed that a prison trustee named Ben Howell had brought the gun in and then had run away a few days later[\\"The Coffeyville Daily Journal\\" July 30, 1895 .p.1 quoting \\"The Fort Smith Times\\"] In the meantime, Goldsby had made a friend, Sherman Vann, who was a trusty at the jail.

He jumped the night guards as they came to lock him into his cell. A guard, Lawrence Keating,ODMP Lawrence KeatingKeating FInd a grave memorial was shot in the stomach. As Keating staggered back down the corridor, Goldsby shot him again in the back. Other guards arrived and prevented Goldsby from escaping, but were not able to enter the jail either. Then another prisoner, Henry Starr, convinced the guards to let him go in and get Goldsby out. Moments later he came back with Goldsby, who was unarmed. Hanging The second trial lasted three days, resulting in a guilty verdict and U.S. District Judge Isaac Parker sentenced Goldsby to be hanged on September 10, 1895. A stay was granted, pending an appeal to the Supreme Court. On December 2, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Fort Smith court and Judge Parker again set the execution date as March 17, 1896. On the morning of March 17, Goldsby awoke at six to have a smoke break. He ate a light breakfast sent from the hotel by his mother. At 9:20, his mother and \\"Aunty\\" Amanda Foster were admitted to his cell and shortly afterwards Father Pius arrived. The hanging was scheduled for 11 am, but was delayed until 2 pm so his sister Georgia could see him before the hanging. She was scheduled to arrive at 1 pm on the eastbound train. Shortly after 2 pm while on the gallows, it was reported Goldsby was asked if he had anything to say and he replied, \\"I came here to die, not make a speech.\\" About 12 minutes later, Crawford \\"Cherokee Bill\\" Goldsby, the most notorious outlaw in the Territory, was dead. The body was placed in a coffin, which was placed in a box and taken to the Missouri Pacific depot. Placed aboard the train, Ellen and Georgia escorted the body to Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, for interment at the Cherokee National Cemetery. On April 20, 1897, Ike \\"Robinson\\" {Rogers}, who was reported to have been involved in the capture of Cherokee Bill, was shot and killed by Clarence Goldsby at Ft Gibson Oklahoma.

The ship, which was owned by the Greek company Thenamaris Inc. and registered in Malta, was refloated two months later by the salvage company Donjon Marine who received title to the ship as payment. A year later the ship was scrapped. Circumstances of wreck After delivery of its load of Colombian sugar in Saint John, New Brunswick Eldia was hit by a storm delivering winds. This storm was part of a period of extreme weather which caused President Ronald Reagan to pledge federal disaster relief. Running for the open sea without cargo or ballast, and therefore riding high on the waves, Eldia was unable to match the strength of the storms. Her captain, Ernesto Garces, was also hampered by her lack of contemporary electronic technology for monitoring the weather, which had enabled other ships in the area to anticipate the problems that would come with the storm and take appropriate action; all he could do was monitor radio broadcasts. He attempted to bring the ship under control but was forced onto Nauset Beach at around 4pm. Two hours later the ship was abandoned by its crew of 23 Filipinos, who were rescued by a helicopter from Air Station Cape Cod. Due to the ease of access to the area New England residents crowded to see the sight when the weather improved. One estimation is that approximately 150,000 did so. The town collected US$81,693 by charging $2 a day for visitors' car parking, and many businesses conducted a lot of additional trade during this curious period. The wreck was drawn back off the beach on May 17, 1984, taken to a scrap-yard in Rhode Island and then on to another at Staten Island. The ship was reportedly cut up in either 1985 or 1989. Archive material The Orleans public library maintains a collection of memorabilia related to Eldia including photos, accounts and official records. A local coffeehouse and market in East Orleans was named after the famous ship but was closed in 2006. The original owners of the shop donated their collection of Eldia images, original paintings, newspaper articles and personal accounts to the Orleans Historic Society.

Erected after her death in 1635 Elin Ulfsdotter Snakenborg, Marchioness of Northampton, also known as Helena, and Helena the Red for her red hair, (1548/1549 - 10 April 1635) was a Swedish-born noblewoman, Maid of Honour of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and Marchioness of Northampton by her marriage to William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton. Family and lineage She was born in Sweden, as Elin Ulfsdotter of Fyllingarum in the province of Ostrogothia, in either 1548 or 1549, as a younger daughter of Ulf Henriksson, lord of Fyllingarum (d. c. 1565), of the Bååt family, Senator of Sweden, and his wife Agneta Knutsdotter, heiress of Norrnes. Her father was a supporter of Gustav I, king of Sweden. By all accounts, Helena was a beautiful woman, with large brown eyes, red hair, and a pink and white complexion. She was described as having a strong will and independent mind. Helena had two brothers and three sisters who survived childhood and had children of their own. Helena was baptized and given the name of her paternal grandmother, Elin Ulfsdotter of the Norwegian house of Sudreim, and her paternal grandfather's grandmother, another Elin Snakenborg. The name Snakenborg was taken from Helena's paternal grandfather's paternal grandmother, the said Elin Henriksdotter Snakenborg, whose patrilineal ancestors were originally from Mecklenburg in Germany. Also Helena's mother seems to have been a descendant of Agnes of Borgarsyssel, natural daughter of Haakon V of Norway. Contrary to claims presented in some genealogies, Marchioness Helena's ancestry has not been proven to include medieval Viking Earls of Orkney. And also contrary to claims in some genealogies, she seems not to have descended from the sister of St Bridget of Sweden.  Journey to England  Helena was one of six young Swedish noble ladies who were Maids of Honour in the retinue of Princess Cecilia of Sweden, Margravine of Baden, second-eldest daughter of King Gustav I. Cecilia and her retinue departed Sweden in Autumn 1564 on a voyage to England, at the invitation of Queen Elizabeth I. It was rumoured that Cecilia was journeying to England to press the suit of her half-brother King Eric XIV of Sweden to marry Queen Elizabeth. Because Denmark-Norway was hostile towards Sweden, they were forced to take a roundabout, land route. They travelled through Finland, Livonia, Poland and Germany, which was a lengthy journey, until they reached Calais. The party is also reported to have been hampered by bad weather, and the last leg by seasickness. The voyage lasted almost a year until they reached their destination - they arrived on 8 September 1565 at Dover. Cecilia of Baden was at the time in her ninth month of pregnancy. The welcoming party at Dover was led by Sir William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton (1513–1571), the only surviving son of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal, and brother of the late Queen consort Catherine Parr.  Marchioness of Northampton  In London they settled at Bedford House. On their arrival many prominent members of the English nobility received the party, including Queen Elizabeth. Helena Snakenborg caught the interest of the elderly (then 52 years old) Marquess of Northampton, who soon started to court her. Margravine Cecilia left England in April 1566 in order to escape her creditors. Helena then became one of the maids of honour to Queen Elizabeth I, and remained in the country for the rest of her life. She was promoted her to gentlewoman of the royal privy chamber. She was subsequently granted many privileges, such as her own lodgings at Hampton Court Palace, servants, and a horse. Lord Northampton hoped to marry Helena but there was a difficulty because his first, though divorced, wife Anne Bourchier, 7th Baroness Bourchier, was still living. They had divorced in 1552, and he had since remarried, his second wife having died in 1565; however, the Church of England did not acknowledge subsequent marriages of divorced persons until the death of the previous spouse. Anne died in 1571, and Northampton married Helena almost immediately, with the queen's approval. The wedding took place in May 1571 in Elizabeth's presence in the queen's closet at Whitehall Palace, and the couple divided their time between their houses in Guildford, Surrey, and at Stanstead Hall, Essex. They had no children. The marquess died suddenly on 28 October 1571. The Dowager Marchioness Helena had received a substantial dower and in 1574 she was granted the manor of Hemingford Grey by the Queen.  Second marriage  Helena's second husband was Thomas Gorges, of Longford, Wiltshire, a second cousin of the late Anne Boleyn, and descended from the first Howard Duke of Norfolk. The queen was originally in favour of Thomas' courtship of Helena but changed her mind and refused to consent to a marriage: Helena was a marchioness, and by marriage the Queen's kinswoman, Gorges yet only a gentleman. Helena married Thomas Gorges secretly in about 1576. When Elizabeth learned of their clandestine act, Helena was exiled from the court, and Thomas was incarcerated in The Tower of London for a brief period. However, Helena was later reinstated, possibly with the help of her influential friend, Lord Chamberlain Thomas Radcliffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex. Helena and Thomas had eight (surviving) children. The couple's first child was born in June 1578 and named Elizabeth (1578–1659) after the queen, who stood as godmother; Elizabeth would marry twice, first Sir Hugh Smyth and second Ferdinando Gorges. Helena's first son, Francis Gorges (c.1579–1599), was allegedly named after their close friend, Sir Francis Drake. They had two more daughters, Frances Gorges (1580–1649) and Bridget Gorges (1584-c1634), and four more sons, all of whom were later knighted: Edward Gorges, first Baron Gorges of Dundalk (b 1582/3, d in or before 1652), Theobald Gorges (1583–1647), Robert Gorges (1588–1648), and Thomas Gorges (b 1589, d after 1624). The couple had their town house at Whitefriars. Helena persuaded Thomas Gorges to rebuild his property at Longford. The mansion had been damaged by fire when he acquired it and a replacement was completed at great expense by 1591, under the final supervision of John Thorpe. Longford Castle was the model for the 'Castle of Amphialeus' in Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia. Thomas Gorges of Longford was knighted in 1586. Queen Elizabeth granted Helena manors in Huntingdonshire and Wiltshire. The marchioness was still highly regarded by Queen Elizabeth and often acted as her deputy at the baptism of the children of distinguished noblemen, particularly towards the end of the reign, when the queen's health was deteriorating. It has been reported that Marchioness Helena did not participate in court intrigues, instead she was devoted to her family. In 1582 Thomas was sent as English envoy to Sweden and met Helena's family members. Helena also had continuous correspondence with relatives in Sweden, as well as the Duke Charles of Sudermannia, later king Charles IX, her childhood friend. In 1584 the queen granted the estate at Sheen to Helena and Thomas for their life. It was a former monastery directly north from the queen's chief residence, the Richmond Palace near the City of London. This meant that Thomas and Helena were able to live with their children while also serving at the Royal Court. Later life Helena Snakenborg, Marchioness of Northampton, in coronation robes, 1603. Queen Elizabeth died in March 1603. Marchioness Helena was the chief mourner in the royal funeral procession as senior peeress because Arbella Stuart refused to undertake the role and King James had not yet arrived in London. In the funeral procession, she walked close behind the Queen's coffin, supported by the Lord High Treasurer and the Lord High Admiral of England.Whitelock, Anna, \\"Elizabeth's Bedfellows, An Intimate History of the Queen's Court\\", Bloomsbury Publishing 2013 This is mentioned as apogee of her career. In July 1603, Helena and Thomas took part in the coronation of the new monarch, James I and his wife Anne of Denmark. Shortly afterward, they moved to Longford from plague-ridden London. The accession of James I meant that Helena was demoted from the new queen's privy chamber. However both occasionally served at the new Court and in other royal tasks. Helena brokered the king's relations with Sweden; for example the Swedish attempt to have Princess Elizabeth, the king's eldest daughter, as bride for the Swedish heir, Gustav Adolf, son of Charles IX (which project was prevented by Anne of Denmark, her mother). Sir Thomas Gorges died on 30 March 1610 at the age of seventy-four, after which Marchioness Helena increasingly retreated from public life. She reportedly remained a devoted member of the Church of England. Most of the time she resided at her house of Sheen, near the Court, but in the end retreated to Redlynch in Somerset, the manor of her son Sir Robert Gorges. Letters show that Helena had close contact with her children and grandchildren. Marchioness Helena's last preserved letter, dated 8 September 1634, to her grandson, is signed with a clearly wavering hand. Helena died at the age of 86 on 10 April 1635 at Redlynch, and was buried on 14 May in Salisbury Cathedral. It has been claimed that Helena had no fewer than ninety-two direct descendants at the time of her death.

Coaling at sea was critical to navies and speed of coal transfer was an important metric of naval efficiency. In 1883, forty tons an hour was considered fast and it would take over twelve hours to restock half the bunkers of a typical ship, . Coals from Newcastle For many years, the Durham and Northumberland coalfields supplied a rapidly expanding London with vast tonnages of coal, and a large fleet of coastal colliers travelled up and down the east coast of England loaded with \\"black diamonds\\". Sir Charles Palmer pioneered the construction of iron-hulled steam colliers at his Jarrow shipyard, which began to rapidly replace the earlier wooden ships. This inadvertently led to the eventual decline of the glassmaking industry on Tyneside and Wearside, as prior to this, they had had access to large supplies of sand, used as ballast in the wooden colliers returning from London. The iron colliers had ballast tanks which meant water could simply be pumped in, greatly reducing the turnaround time as the sand no longer needed to be loaded and unloaded. Coal was also exported to Europe, and wooden colliers returned with goods such as roofing tiles in their holds. The first Palmer-built iron hulled steam collier was SS John Bowes of 1852. There had been an earlier iron hull screw propelled collier, the short-lived SS Bedlington of 1841 built in South Shields.The Steam Colliers Fleets by Messrs MacRae & Waine, Waine Research 1990 pages 11–13. A notable incident involving a collier occurred not long after the opening of the Victoria Tunnel in Newcastle. The hemp rope which controlled the speed of wagons descending the tunnel to the river from Spital Tongues Colliery snapped, and some of the wagons landed in the Tyne while others lodged on the deck of a vessel being loaded. “The” Illustrated London News w/e 15 April 1843, p. 253 \\"Newcastle\\" books.google.co.uk, accessed 9 December 2019 The wagons were recovered at low tide, the rope was repaired, and the papers of the day treated the whole incident as something of a joke. Six months later, the rope snapped again, and the wagons landed in the hold of a waiting collier and sank it. After this, it was decided a wire rope would be a better option. This is probably the only recorded incident of a train having sunk a ship. =Loading and unloading= Loading the colliers was carried out by hand at first, especially where coal was transferred from keels which had brought it downstream from parts of the river that the colliers were unable to navigate, but as the quantities handled increased, specialised jetties known as \\"staithes\\" began to be built.DUNSTON STAITHS www.dunstonstaiths.org.uk, accessed 15 December 2019 These were of numerous designs. Some had spouts used for unscreened or small coal, others known as \\"drops\\" had steep inclines at the end, down which a wagon would be lowered directly into the hold, minimising the breakage of coal. Some had both drops and spouts. The drops and spouts could be raised and lowered with the tide. Later, elevators began to be introduced, such as those at Bates Staithes in Blyth, Northumberland and Harton Low Staithes in South Shields. These staithes used spouts. The largely intact Dunston Staiths on the Tyne are a good example of this type. In Scotland, a system was common where wagons would be placed on a cradle and lifted into the hold of the ship, but this system was rarely used elsewhere. Two large steam cranes were built for this purpose at the Harton Low Staithes, but it was found that despite their size and power they were too slow to handle the amount of coal that was arriving at the staithes, and were replaced by elevators. The men who worked at the staithes were known as teemers and trimmers. Teemers would open the doors on the bottom of the wagons to allow the coal to fall into hoppers under the rail deck on top of the staithes, or in the case of drops, directly into the hold of the collier. The trimmers worked in the hold, spreading and levelling the coal with shovels and rakes so that its weight would be evenly distributed. Skilled trimmers could stand with their shovel under the stream of coal coming from a spout or the end of a conveyor and angle it so the coal would ricochet off into the part of the hold they wanted to fill. This was a dangerous job, as the holds could fill with firedamp given off by the coal, resulting in an explosion. More modern systems are designed to be able to evenly distribute the coal without the need for men working in the holds of the ships. Although, in later years, the colliers faced competition from the railways in supplying coal for domestic use in the capital, large quantities of coal were used at the numerous power stations on the banks of the River Thames, and wharves were constructed alongside them for unloading the colliers. These vessels known as \\"flat-irons\\" with a low-profile superstructures and fold-down funnels and masts to fit under bridges over the Thames above the Pool of London. The wharf at Battersea Power Station is still extant, and the cranes used for unloading the coal can be seen on the riverfront. These are fitted with clamshell buckets and in operation loaded a hopper, which in turn fed a conveyor system leading to the power station's coal bunkers. The modern equivalent can be seen at the Tyne Coal Terminal, unloading bulk carriers. Gas Light and Coke Company had similar facilities at its large gasworks, also alongside the Thames, for handling the large quantity of bituminous coal which was needed to supply the capital with town gas. Alternate uses In the late eighteenth century, a number of wooden-hulled sailing colliers gained fame after being adapted for use in voyages of exploration in the South Pacific, for which their flat- bottomed hulls and sturdy construction made them well-suited. , the first aircraft carrier in the United States Navy, was a converted collier (originally USS Jupiter (AC-3)).

Minard was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He began his studies of composition at the University of Ontario, then at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal, studying under Gilles Tremblay. He then continued his studies with John Rea at McGill University. He was a member of the music design and performance ensemble Sonde from 1979 to 1988. In 1988 he undertook doctoral studies in environmental music at the University of Paris VIII studying under composer Horacio Vaggione. From 1992 to 1996 he taught at the studio for electronic music at the TU Berlin. Since 1997, he has been Professor of Electro-Acoustic Composition at the Hochschule für Musik Franz Liszt and the Bauhaus-Universität in Weimar, Germany.  Artistic work  Minard has concentrated his work on electro-acoustic composition and sound installations in public since the early 1980s. One primary area of interest in his work is dealing with acoustic space in an urban world increasingly polluted with noise, and redefining the concept of functional music in that context. He points out that, with the exception of concert halls, theaters and some conference rooms, the ear is rarely a factor in the planning and design of architecture and urban infrastructure. Minard describes two different strategies of \\"composing space\\" which enters into dialogue with the architectural and acoustic environment: conditioning and articulation. Conditioning he considers to be analogous to laying a mantle of color over a space in the visual realm. Articulation refers to the addition of the dimension of time to architecture using sound; the movement of sound articulates and decorates the space. Some examples of his work utilizing these principles include; Music for Passageways (1985), Sound Catchers (1991), Silent Music (1994), Still / Life (1996), Intermezzo (1999), Sound Bits (2002), Outside In (2006) and Klangzug (2010).

He was signed by the Chicago Cubs in 1964 out of the University of Texas at Austin. A Texas Longhorns star pitcher, Hartenstein led his team to the 1962 and 1963 CWS tournaments. After being signed by Chicago, he led the Texas League with a 2.19 ERA in 1965 while pitching for the Dallas–Fort Worth Spurs. On June 17, 1965 Hartenstein had one of the most impressive pitching feats in Texas League history, in a game against the Austin Braves as the starter. The Spurs had a 1–0 lead going into the ninth inning when he gave up a tying run. The game continued that way with Hartenstein pitching 18 innings. He allowed one run, eight hits, walked four and struck out seven. The game continued through the 25th inning with Austin winning 2–1. At the time it was the longest game in Texas League history. Hartenstein entered the majors in 1965 with the Cubs, appearing in one game as a pinch runner.

Winston Francis Donnell Winston (October 2, 1857 – January 26, 1941) was a North Carolina politician and judge who served as the tenth Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina from 1905 to 1909 under Governor Robert B. Glenn. Francis Winston, originally a Republican, became a leading Democrat after objecting to the inclusion of African Americans in the political alliance between his party and the Populists. He helped lead the Democrats' \\"white supremacy\\" campaigns in 1898 —when he was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives— and in 1900. Early life and education Winston lived in Bertie County, North Carolina, where he was raised on a plantation in Windsor called \\"Windsor Castle.\\" His brother was the university president George T. Winston. In 1873, Winston entered Cornell University but did not graduate. When The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill reopened in 1875, he transferred there as the first student to register. He graduated from UNC in 1879. The following year he taught school and studied law with his father, Patrick Henry Winston. In 1880 he attended Dick and Dillard Law School in Greensboro and obtained his license to practice law in 1881. This same year he was appointed Clerk of Court for Bertie County, a position which he held for two years. After this Winston entered into a successful law practice of his own in Bertie County. Political career In 1884, Winston was the Republican nominee for North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction. In 1887, he represented Bertie and Northampton Counties in the North Carolina Senate (presumably as a Republican), and in 1898, he accepted the Democratic nomination for a seat in the House of Representatives, to which he was re- elected in 1900. In 1901, Gov. Charles B. Aycock, a college friend of Winston, appointed him Judge of superior court for the second Judicial District. In 1904, Winston was elected lieutenant governor. Under the constitution of the time, he was not eligible to serve more than a single term. He later served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Personal life Winston married Rosa Mary Kenney. Although the Winstons had no children, they adopted a nephew, Stephen Etheridge Winston Kenney. Francis Winston was an active Mason, serving as state Grand Master in 1906 and 1907. He also served as president of the North Carolina Bar Association.

Characters * Ramon – the head of the family * Encarna - submissive wife =The children= * Teresita – eldest daughter, most self- possessed of the children * Clemencia - tiny and weak of constitution, nervous by temperament * Adeling - pretty, strong-willed and impulsive, librarian in a University * Jorge - the eldest brother * Flavio - most reserved of the brothers, his reserved nature is dangerous, his brooding eyes reveal strange longings and desires which led him to become a black smith. * Gonzalo - the youngest of the family and had sex with a prostitute. * Tony - the prodigal son who ran away to the U.S and is said to be gay. =Other Characters= Matteo Sunga * Tio Carlos, Tio koleyt, Tia Pelagia, Tia Pusit, Nilda, Jethro Jake, Mr. Sarte, a servant, a policeman Time * First Act - seven in the evening * Second Act - two weeks later, eight in the evening * Third Act - three weeks later, eight-thirty in the evening Setting a dimly lighted and richly-furnished living room Synopsis =The main conflict = The conflict of the plot revolved around the character of Ramon. As the father, Ramon is absolutely convinced that it is only his will that must be obeyed by all the members of his family. His rigidity provoked a miniature revolt among his children. Tony, a character vaguely described in the story was the first to express his outrage against the severity of the condition. He decided to leave and settle in the United States. As a result, his father considers him no longer as his son and forbids his name to be mentioned in the house. Act one started with the obvious abhorrence expressed by the children by seeking an explanation from their mother why they were treated as if they were irresponsible adults devoid of judgment. All the children felt their existences were restricted within the confines of their house. Encarna (the mother) reasoned with the children, telling them that their father knew what is best for them and was simply protecting them from the wickedness of the outside world. The comfort and luxury of the house, she insisted, should be good enough to spend their extra time. The children thought otherwise and demanded their mother to persuade their father to grant them more freedom and to live life without his lingering presence. The argument the children had with their mother was an overture to the coming tragedy. The children were all resigned that their fate was solely controlled by their father and only through radical actions that they can recover and ultimately discover themselves. = Climax = The succeeding scenes were crafted to depict the intense yearning of the children to get away from the commanding presence of their father. Adeling decided to abandon her family together with Jethro Jake. The consequence of her act produced a more rigorous control from the father allowing the rest of the children to increase their sufferings. When Adeling left, Clemencia was utterly distressed and got sick with anemia. Jorge on the other hand was reprimanded by his father when his teacher, Prof. Sarte, informed his father that he stole money (forty pesos) from his class fund. Both Flavio and Gonzalo had brought home their own version of troubles; the latter was infected with syphilis from an unrespectable woman and Flavio was shot and killed during a fight in a cabaret. After witnessing all these painful episodes in the family, Clemencia finally retired and in a peculiar way somehow liberated herself from her father’s tyranny. Before all these events took place, Tio Carlos was constantly reminding Ramon that the children felt intense suffocation the way how things transpire in the house. Carlos tried to deliver the message to Ramon, even questioning the way how he rears his children and insisted that a different method is necessary to let the children experience life. Carlos argued that the reason why his children were acting strangely was primarily because they can no longer endure excess repressions. But his warning was plainly ignored and Ramon responded by further suppressing the will of his children. Tia Pelagia was another person who showed affection and to whom the children expressed their emotions and disgust. = Turning point = Ramon realized that the events that happened in the family proved that his ways were complete disaster. He felt absolute resignation and defeat; he had created hell inside his house that ruined the lives of his children. = Falling action = After recognizing his defeat, Ramon decided let go of his children and allowed them to make decisions for themselves. He finally gave Teresita his blessing to enter the convent and dedicate herself to God. Jorge was given permission to leave the house and find his own way. He also reconciled himself and admitted that Adeling had found her new home in the warm embrace of Jethro Jake. = Conclusion = Ramon Sampang made peace with his sick son Gonzalo, the only child left after all the rest decided to abandon the house. He showed his remorse by giving joy to his son by inviting him son to spend sometime in their country house in Sibul.  Theme  The play revealed the dominance of male in the Filipino family. Though there were several female characters, the characters of Ramon and Carlos were imposing. The mother was projected as weak and somebody who readily submits to the will of her husband. The children though abhor the situation they still showed astounding reverence to their father which is customarily expected from Filipino children.  First Performance  The play was first staged by the Filipino Players under the author's direction at the Manila Grand Opera House on February 27, 1940.  Productions  Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP), the official performing group of the University of the Philippines, in celebration of Wilfrido Ma.

The congregation was established in 1855 by Reverend Charles LeDuc, the brother of William LeDuc. The congregation built a stone church at that time, then decided to build a new, larger church in 1875. It was designed by Charles N. Daniels. Because of financial difficulties, it took nearly seven years to finish the building, although it was complete enough to host its first services in 1881. Perspective view In 1907 the tall steeple was struck by lightning, which started a fire that left the church gutted. Architect Harry Wild Jones from Minneapolis was hired to design the restoration. He was asked to make the new church resemble the original as much as possible, so both the interior and the exterior are his work.

Though some teams do contain Maori players, frequently the haka has been performed by teams with players from other Polynesian groups, indicating that it has become part of a pan-Polynesian sports culture. The use of the haka outside of New Zealand is controversial, as it can be considered culturally insensitive or offensive. There is also the matter of lyrical content of a haka possibly being at odds with the clothing, national origins, or other attributes of those performing it (such as a haka referencing New Zealand being performed by Americans, or one incorporating a reference to red or black clothing being performed by a sports team with grey or blue uniforms). The Hawaiian war chant, or dance, is called the Ha’a. It dates back centuries, and is one of the many Polynesian pre-war dances or chants. The traditional Hawaiian Ha’a has been adopted by the Rainbow Warriors (Hawaiian football team) in place of the previously used Haka. Kahuku \\"Red Raiders\\" Kahuku High School \\"Red Raiders\\" football team may have been the first American sports team to regularly perform a haka, doing so since 2001. The town of Kahuku is located just north of Laie, Hawaii, the home of Brigham Young University-Hawaii, which has many international students, including Polynesians from throughout the South Pacific, and both the student body and local community includes many Fijians, Hawaiians, Maoris, Samoans, Tahitians, and Tongans, among other ethnic groups. Today, the haka they perform is their own, \\"Kaipahua Kura\\", meaning 'Red Raider' in the Maori language. Written and choreographed by Seamus Fitzgerald, a special instructor at the Brigham Young University-Hawaii Campus and a Manager/Cultural Specialist in the Aotearoa or New Zealand section of the Polynesian Cultural Center in La'ie.  Brigham Young University  The BYU Cougars football team began performing the haka with their season-opener in 2005. Minutes before kickoff, members of the BYU football team lined up on the southeast corner of the field and performed \\"Ka Mate\\" for a stadium full of cheering fans. Planned and prepared under a tight veil of secrecy for months, this new tradition was inspired by Bryce Mahuika, the team’s only player of Māori descent. Mahuika had recently lost his father, Over a thousand mourners attended his funeral, including Curtis Brown, the Cougars' star running back, to honor the fallen chief. Kyle and Bryce Mahuika, his sons, led them in a haka at the gravesite prior to lowering the casket into the ground. After returning from his father's funeral, Bryce Mahuika attended a team meeting where Bronco Mendenhall, the head coach, asked the team for personal requests that might help the team reach their goals in 2006. Bryce Mahuika went up to the front to thank everybody for their support, when he had the idea to do the haka to fire up the crowd and prepare for football games. He explained the origins and significance of the haka to the team, and they enthusiastically supported the idea. There have been occasions where the BYU haka caused a near-altercation with the opposition. The BYU rugby team performs a haka that was specially created for them. BYU's use of the haka may have influenced local high school and community football teams. Timpview High School in Provo has performed the haka before games, and even some children's flag football teams have been seen performing it in Provo.  University of Hawaii  During a hugely successful 2006 football season, it became tradition for the University of Hawaii Warriors football team to perform the Haka. It was introduced to the team by Tala Esera, who had performed the haka as a member of the Kahuku \\"Red Raiders\\", high school football team. Typically, the Warriors performed their version of the \\"Kapa O Pango\\" haka 20 minutes before the opening kickoff. After home wins, the team also performed a post-game version. However, before its final regular season game against Oregon State, the team was alerted by a university professor that the team may be infringing upon a copyright by performing the dance. The team ended up doing a 'variation' of the Haka before the Oregon State game, and planned on unveiling a 'new haka' before the team's Hawaii Bowl appearance against Arizona State on December 24. The All-Blacks rugby team does their Haka with permission from the Ngāti Toa iwi. Through a spokeswoman, Hawaii's athletic director said: \\"Our legal department is looking into the issue. We don't believe we're violating any copyright laws at this time.\\" Players on the team add that their version of the dance is not 'step for step' with the All-Blacks Haka. While the team has adopted the \\"Kapa O Pango\\" as its game day ritual haka, the words speak of a black jersey, which is the official home color of the UH Warriors. However, the black jersey refers specifically to the All Blacks jersey, for whom the haka was written. The original version of the haka also mentions \\"Aotearoa\\", which is Māori for New Zealand, and \\"Ponga-Ra\\" meaning silver fern, both not applicable to the University of Hawaii football team. However, these words are dropped when the Warriors perform their version. 2006 Heisman Trophy Candidate Quarterback Colt Brennan was also filmed saying that he was learning the Samoan words to the haka when the haka is clearly Māori. (It should noted that Brennan may have meant learning Samoan would assist him in learning to pronounce the Māori words, not that this haka was in Samoan. Also the Warriors do not say \\"Aotearoa\\" or New Zealand when they perform their version). On December 24, 2006 the Warriors performed a haka prior to the Sheraton Hawaii Bowl game. in contrary to what was stated prior to the game, the Warriors, did not perform an entirely new haka but used the same gestures as \\"Kapa O Pango\\" as they have done all season. However, the chant itself could not be identified and it could not be confirmed if it remains the same or if certain words were changed to accommodate the team and the university specifically as the haka was not televised. YouTube hosts several clips of the Warriors' haka prior to the 2006 Hawaii Bowl game, but none have audio of sufficient quality to allow their chant at that time to be deciphered. In 2007, linebacker Timo Paepule has now taken the leadership duties of the haka. The Warriors performed their usual version of \\"Kapa O Pango\\" for over 4,000 fans in attendance at their annual \\"Football Ohana Festival\\" which included a 90-minute practice session. Paepule was quoted in saying that they plan to adjust the haka before the start of the 2007 fall season. Paepule also noted that the team actually prefers to perform the haka just for themselves and not as an attraction for the team. In August 2007 the team announced that they would be dropping the Maori haka, in favour of a traditional Hawaiian war chant, which is called the Haa. The University of Hawaii’s players, composed their own Haa. Linebacker Brad Kalilimoku, defensive back Guyton Galdeira and defensive tackle Keala Watson worked together to write the words and create the movements for the ritual. The three players are native Hawaiians and have experience with the language. Galdeira's training in hula also added cultural flavor to the haa. Although many fans have asked for the lyrics so that they could join in, the lyrics are kept within the team as a means of keeping the team unified. Heading into the 2010 season, the team moved away from the haa, for unknown reasons, and began to perform the Maori \\"Tika Tonu\\" haka prior to games. At the start of the 2013 season, the team did not perform the haka live before home games (although it was still performed ahead of away games). Instead, a video of the team performing the haka was played on big screens at the Warriors' home stadium, before the team would make their entrance onto the field. However, by the end of the season, the Warriors had returned to performing the haka live before all games, both home and away.  Trinity High School, Euless, Texas  Trinity High School of Euless, Texas first performed the \\"Ka Mate\\" haka for fans at the beginning of the 2005 season, copying from the New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team. Several famous All Blacks such as Jonah Lomu, Doug Howlett, and Pita Alatini have been of Tongan birth or descent, and Tongan players have helped transform Trinity High School into a Texas football powerhouse. The Euless area is home to an estimated 4,000 people of Tongan descent. \\"We do the haka to ignite the breath of competition. It means that I've got your back and you've got mine,\\" said Mr. Kautai, a player who stands and weighs 280 pounds (127 kg). On 10 June 2008, former First Lady Laura Bush was greeted with a haka by the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team in Bamyan Province, Afghanistan. She explained later in an interview that she was able to keep her cool because she is a fan of Texas football...\\"I actually know about the haka because there's one football team in Texas that won state last year that happens to have a lot of Tongans ... in Dallas-Fort Worth,\\" she said. \\"And they do the haka. If I didn't already know about it and hadn't already seen this football team on television do this, I might have been really surprised by it.\\"  Jefferson High School, Portland, Oregon  Jefferson High School (Portland, Oregon) has performed the \\"Ka Mate\\" haka beginning in the 2007 season. As with some other schools, the haka was introduced by Tongan students, of which there are fewer than 20 at Jefferson. The school is predominantly African-American. \\"We are defending our land,\\" said Tongan player Leni Feaomoeata, 15. \\"Jefferson has the reputation for losing, being dismissed. We wanted to defend our school, to show we have heart.\\" The team and school have embraced the haka despite opposition from other Oregon schools and sports administrators, who consider the haka intimidating. This has led to an ongoing controversy, and has resulted in imposed penalties on the school's team. Other coaches complained to Jefferson's athletic director, labelling the haka \\"scary\\" and the moves \\"gang signs..[the opposition]... left the team's staff exasperated and disappointed...The Oregon School Activities Association ultimately decided the ritual amounted to taunting and said the players must do the dance with their backs to the opposing team or face a 15-yard penalty at the start of each game.\\" Opposition has not deterred the team, despite the penalties, and Jefferson has persevered with their new tradition. News of the controversy has spread even to New Zealand. Arizona Wildcats From 2009 the University of Arizona Arizona Wildcats, which has a large number of Polynesian student- athletes, performed the \\"Ka Mate\\" haka, but this ceased in 2018 after being criticised as inappropriate and disrespectful.  Munster Rugby  During a celebration match against the All Blacks on 18 November 2008 to commemorate the opening of their new stadium at Thomond Park, a haka was performed by four members of Irish provincial rugby team Munster. Former New Zealand Maori captain Rua Tipoki, former All Black Doug Howlett, former New Zealand sevens player Lifeimi Mafi and former Marlborough player Jerry Manning fronted the All Blacks, who replied with their own haka.  Bethesda RFC  In Bethesda, Wales, on the 20th of December 2008, in an unlikely WRU Challenge Cup contest between Welsh Premiership side Cardiff RFC and Bethesda RFC of Division Six North, (whose entire squad was drawn from Ysgol Dyffryn Ogwen the local Welsh medium comprehensive school,) Bethesda’s resident Maori, and club Life Member, Bill Huaki performed a Welsh language version of the Haka. A motivated Bethesda went on to score three tries against Cardiff’s nine, the game ending in a respectable 17-55 scoreline, with the slate quarrying village’s amateurs earning much praise for their performance against the Welsh capital’s professional team, which included internationals Craig Morgan and Lee Jarvis.

In 1971-72, he was a Social Science Research Council Senior Faculty Fellow at Jean Piaget’s Centre d’Epistémologie Génétique in Geneva, Switzerland. From 1975 through 1980, he was a Research Psychologist in the Laboratory of Developmental Psychology at the National Institute of Mental Health, where he served on the Research Advisory Group to the Director of the Institute. Since 1980, he has been Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the University of Vermont, where he was Director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry from 1984 through 2007. He has been Chair of the American Psychological Association’s Task Force on Classification of Children’s Behavior and a member of the American Psychiatric Association’s Task Force on DSM-III-R. In 2000, he founded the nonprofit Research Center for Children, Youth, and Families at the University of Vermont and has served as President of the Center since it was founded.  The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA)  Achenbach and his colleagues have developed a family of standardized instruments for assessing people’s behavioral, emotional, social, and thought problems, competencies, adaptive functioning, and strengths. The instruments are collectively known as the . They are available in over 100 languages and their use has been reported in some 10,000 publications by 15,000 authors from over 100 cultures. Details can be obtained at www.aseba.org. The ASEBA includes developmentally calibrated rating forms completed by parents and teachers of 1½-5 and 6-18-year-olds. The most widely used form is the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), which has been cited in some 40,000 publications. The ASEBA also includes self-report forms completed by 11-18-year-olds, 18-59-year-olds, and people over the age of 59. For ages 18–59 and 60-90+, the ASEBA includes forms completed by collaterals, i.e., people who know the adult who is being assessed, such as spouses, partners, friends, family members, and therapists. Other ASEBA forms are designed to assess children on the basis of observations by psychologists who administer tests to the children, by clinical interviewers, and by observers in settings such as classrooms and group activities. The problem items of the ASEBA forms are scored on profiles of syndromes identified via statistical analyses of assessment data from hundreds of thousands of respondents in dozens of societies. The problem items are also scored on scales that correspond to diagnostic categories of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (the DSM). Additional scales assess broad-spectrum Internalizing and Externalizing patterns of problems. The ASEBA forms also assess competencies, adaptive functioning, and personal strengths. To enable users to compare scores obtained by individuals who are being assessed with scores obtained by peers, norms are provided that are derived from scores obtained by individuals sampled from relevant populations. Data from hundreds of thousands of respondents assessed by indigenous researchers in over 50 societies have been used to construct multicultural norms. The multicultural norms enable users to compare scores obtained by particular individuals with scores obtained by peers in societies relevant to those individuals. There are separate norms for females and males, different age groups, and forms completed by particular informants, such as parents, teachers, and adult collaterals. Because people’s functioning may vary from one context and interaction partner to another, the ASEBA assesses people from multiple perspectives. Various ASEBA forms are designed to be completed by people who see the person who is being assessed in different contexts, as well as forms completed by the person who is being assessed. The importance of obtaining information from multiple perspectives has been demonstrated by meta-analytic findings of substantial disparities between ratings of children’s problems by mothers, fathers, teachers, mental health workers, observers, and children themselves (Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987). The disparities between different informants indicate that each informant may provide different information about a child. Consequently, valid assessment requires information from multiple informants, such as a child’s mother, father, and teacher(s), as well as from the child. The Achenbach et al. (1987) meta-analytic findings have had a major impact on assessment of children for clinical and research purposes, as attested by citations in over 6,000 publications and being described by De Los Reyes and Kazdin as “among the most robust findings in clinical child research”. Meta-analyses by Achenbach, Krukowski, Dumenci, and Ivanova (2005) also found substantial disparities between collateral and self-ratings of adults. These disparities indicate that assessment of adults should include information from collaterals, as well as from the adults who are being assessed. To facilitate use of multi-informant data, ASEBA software provides systematic comparisons between ratings and scale scores obtained from multiple informants. Moreover, the ASEBA Multicultural Family Assessment Module (MFAM enables users to compare multi-informant data for children and their parents on syndromes that have counterparts for ages 6–18 and 18-59. The syndromes that have counterparts for ages 6–18 and 18-59 comprise attention problems, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, anxiety, depression, social withdrawal, thought problems, and somatic complaints without apparent medical cause. If users deem it appropriate for particular families, they can show family members the MFAM results obtained prior to mental health services, plus results obtained at reassessments during and following services.

The buildings blocks of Chile's geology assembled during the Paleozoic Era. Chile was by then the southwestern margin of the supercontinent Gondwana. In the Jurassic Gondwana begun to split and the ongoing period of crustal deformation and mountain building known as the Andean orogeny begun. In the Late Cenozoic Chile definitely separated from Antarctica, the Andes expienced a great rise accomplained by a cooling climate and the onset of glaciations. The subduction interactions shaped four main morphostructures of Chile: the Andes; the Intermediate Depression, the Coast Range, and the Peru–Chile Trench off the coast. Since Chile is on an active continental margin, it has many volcanoes. Almost the entire country is subject to earthquakes arising from strains in the Nazca and Antarctic Plates or shallow strike-slip faults. Northern Chilean mineral resources are a major economic resources, and the country is the leading producer of copper, lithium and molybdenum. Most of these mineral deposits were created from magmatic hydrothermal activity. The water required to form those deposits derived from the subducted slab of the oceanic crust beneath the Andes. The Chilean Easter Island and Juan Fernández Archipelago are volcanic hotspot islands in the eastward-moving Nazca plate. The geology of the Chilean Antarctic Territory has various commonalities with that of mainland Chile. General characteristics The three primary morphological features derived from the Andes are the Andes Mountains proper, the Chilean Coast Range and the Chilean Central Valley, also known as the Intermediate Depression and the Longitudinal Valley. The mountains run parallel in a north- south direction from Morro de Arica to Taitao Peninsula, making up most of Chile's land surface. South of Taitao, only the Andes Mountains are present. North of the Taitao Peninsula, the Peru–Chile Trench subduction zone is the boundary between the South American and Nazca Plates. At Taitao, the Chile Triple Junction and the Nazca Plate subduct the South American Plate. =The Andes= The Andes are generally higher in northern Chile. In Norte Grande the mountains form a series of plateaus, such as Puna de Atacama and the Altiplano. At a south latitude of 27 degrees, Chile's highest mountain (Ojos del Salado) reaches a height of . Below 42 degrees south, the Andes split into a fjord landscape and the highest mountain is Monte San Valentin at at north of Northern Patagonian Ice Field. As the mountains ebb, the snow line lowers; in the Llanquihue it is at , and in the Magallanes. =Intermediate Depression= The Intermediate Depression, a series of faults running north to south, separates the Andes from the Coast Range with a steady decrease in altitude as the latitude increases. In Norte Grande the Intermediate Depression is partially covered by a series of salt flats, and has the world's largest potassium nitrate deposits. In Norte Chico, the depression disappears briefly before reappearing in a narrow valley at Santiago. From the narrows southward the valley widens until it is interrupted near Loncoche by the Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex (part of the Coast Range), then widening at Los Llanos (near Paillaco). In central and southern Chile (33°–42° south), the landscape is partially covered with glacial sediments from the Andes. In Zona Austral (south of 42° south) the depression dips below sea level, appearing occasionally in islands such as Chiloé. Its southern end is the Isthmus of Ofqui. =Chilean Coast Range= The Chilean Coast Range runs southward along the coast (parallel to the Andes) from Morro de Arica to Taitao Peninsula, ending at the Chile Triple Junction. The range, a combined horst, forearc high and accretionary wedge, was separated from the Andes during the Tertiary rise due to the subsidence of the Intermediate Depression. Geologic history Pangaea separation animation View of the Altiplano plateau in northern Chile The mountains at Torres del Paine National Park have been heavily eroded by the Quaternary glaciations. Retreat of the San Rafael Glacier from 1990 to 2000 =Paleozoic Era= The oldest rocks in Chile are micaceous schists, phyllites, gneisses and quartzites, many examples of which are found in the Coast Range of south-central Chile. The schists of southern Chile were initially formed by sediment in the proto-Pacific Ocean, and later metamorphosed in the forearc wedge of the Peru–Chile Trench. =Mesozoic Era= During the Triassic Period about 250 million years ago Chile was part of the supercontinent Pangaea, which concentrated the world's major land masses. Africa, Antarctica, Australia and India were near Chile. When Pangaea began to split apart during the Jurassic period, South America and the adjacent land masses formed Gondwana. Floral affinities among these now- distant landmasses date from the Gondwanaland period. South America separated from Antarctica and Australia 27 million years ago with the development of the Drake Passage. Across the -wide Drake Passage lie the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula, south of the Scotia Plate, which appear to be a continuation of the Andes. In the extreme south, the Magallanes–Fagnano Fault separates Tierra del Fuego from the small Scotia Plate. The formation of the Andes began during the Jurassic. During the Cretaceous, the Andes began to assume their present form by the uplifting, faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of ancient cratons. Tectonic forces along the subduction zone along the west coast of South America continue to their orogenesis, resulting in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to this day. =Cenozoic Era= The Altiplano plateau was formed during the Tertiary, with several mechanisms proposed; all attempt to explain why the topography of the Andes incorporates a large area of low relief at high altitude (high plateau): # Existence of weaknesses in the Earth's crust prior to tectonic shortening. Such weaknesses would cause the partition of tectonic deformation and uplift into eastern and western cordillera, leaving the necessary space for the formation of the Altiplano basin. # Magmatic processes rooted in the asthenosphere might have contributed to uplift the plateau. # Climate controlled the spatial distribution of erosion and sediment deposition, creating the lubrication along the Nazca Plate subduction and hence influencing the transmission of tectonic forces into South America. # Climate also determined the formation of internal drainage (endorheism) and sediment trapping within the Andes, potentially blocking tectonic deformation in the area between the two cordilleras. Quaternary The Quaternary glaciations left visible marks in most parts of Chile, particularly Zona Sur and Zona Austral. These include ice fields, fjords, glacial lakes and u-shaped valleys. During the Santa María glaciation glaciers extended into the Pacific Ocean at 42° south, dividing the Chilean Coast Range and creating what is now Chacao Channel. Chiloé, part of the Chilean Coast Range, became an island. South of Chacao Channel, Chile's coast is split by fjords, islands and channels; these glaciers created moraines at the edges of the Patagonian lakes, changing their outlets to the Pacific and shifting the continental divide. The remnants of the Patagonian Ice Sheet which covered large parts of Chile and Argentina are the Northern and the Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. It has been suggested that from 1675 to 1850 the San Rafael Glacier advanced during the Little Ice Age. The first documented visit to the area was made in 1675 by the Spanish explorer Antonio de Vea, who entered San Rafael Lagoon through Río Témpanos (\\"Ice Floe River\\") without mentioning the many ice floes for which the river is named. De Vea also wrote that the San Rafael Glacier did not reach far into the lagoon. In 1766 another expedition noticed that the glacier did reach the lagoon and had calved into icebergs. Hans Steffen visited the area in 1898, noting that the glacier now penetrated far into the lagoon. As of 2001, the glacier has retreated behind its 1675 border due to climate change. Pacific islands Most of the moai on Easter island are carved from volcanic tuff. Easter Island is a volcanic high island consisting of three extinct volcanoes: Terevaka, at an altitude of , forms the bulk of the island. Two other volcanoes (Poike and Rano Kau) form the eastern and southern headlands, giving the island its triangular shape. There are numerous lesser cones and other volcanic features: the crater Rano Raraku, the cinder cone Puna Pau and many volcanic caves (including lava tubes). Easter Island and its surrounding islets, including Motu Nui and Motu Iti, form the comminuted apex of a large volcanic mountain rising over from the seabed. It is part of the Sala y Gómez Ridge, a mostly-submarine mountain range with dozens of seamounts. Pukao and Moai are two seamounts west of Easter Island, extending east to the Nazca Seamount. Pukao, Moai and Easter Island were formed during the last 750,000 years, with the last eruption a little over 100,000 years ago. These are the youngest mountains of the Sala y Gómez Ridge, which was formed by the Nazca Plate floating over the Easter hotspot.Haase, Karsten & Stoffers, P & Garbe-Schönberg, Dieter. (1997). The Petrogenetic Evolution of Lavas from Easter Island and Neighbouring Seamounts, Near-ridge Hotspot Volcanoes in the SE Pacific. Journal of Petrology - J PETROL. 38. 785–813. . Only on Easter Island is the Sala y Gómez Ridge dry land. The volcanic Juan Fernández Islands were created by a hotspot in the Earth's mantle penetrating the Nazca Plate. The islands were carried eastward as the plate subducted the South American continent. Radiometric dating indicates that Santa Clara is the oldest of the islands (at 5.8 million years), followed by Robinson Crusoe (3.8–4.2 million years) and Alexander Selkirk (1.0–2.4 million years). Robinson Crusoe is the largest of the islands at , and its highest peak (El Yunque) is high. Alexander Selkirk covers , and its highest peak is Los Innocentes at . Santa Clara covers , reaching an elevation of . Economic geology =Mining= Chuquicamata copper mine in 1984 Chile has the world's largest copper reserves, and is the largest producer and exporter of the metal.U.S. Geological Survey (2005). Minerals Yearbook 2005. Notable copper mines include Chuquicamata and Escondida. Chile accounts for five percent of the Western Hemisphere's gold production, of which 41 percent is a by-product of copper extraction. The country holds the largest world reserves of rhenium and potassium nitrate, and its reserves of molybdenum are estimated to be the third-largest in the world. Most of Chile's mineral resources are in the north; gas, coal and oil reserves, in the southern Magallanes Region, are sufficient for local needs. Guarello Island, in the Magallanes Region, has the world's southernmost limestone mine. =Geothermal energy= Since 2000, geothermal exploration and concessions have been regulated by the Law of Geothermal Concessions (). The Chilean company Geotermia del Pacífico, with support from CORFO, is exploring a location in Curacautín as a site for a geothermal power plant. Geotermia del Paícifco's studies indicated that two geothermal fields near Curacautín could be used for energy production, with a combined capacity to supply 36,000 homes in 2010. One area to be developed is located near the Tolhuaca hot springs, and the other is in Río Blanco Springs.\\"Chile Could Have Geothermal Energy By 2010\\". Santiago Times Another area under consideration for geothermal production is Cordón Caulle. =Tourism= Although geology-focused tourism is rare, there are some sites in which the local geology is a major attraction (for example, the copper mine at Chuquicamata). Geological hazards thumbupright=1.5Map of Valparaíso after the earthquake of 16 August 1906 Area of the city most affected by earthquake City blocks most damaged by fire Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and mass ground movements are frequent occurrences. The subduction zone along Chile's coast has produced the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Earthquakes are notorious for triggering volcanic eruptions, such as the 1960 Cordón Caulle eruption. Chilean earthquakes have produced tsunamis. Landslides occur frequently in the Andes, most following earthquakes. The 2007 Aysén Fjord earthquakes produced several landslides along the Fjords Mountains, spawning a tsunami. Lahars are among the most lethal volcanic hazards in Chile; a lahar destroyed the original site of Coñaripe. =Earthquakes= Major earthquakes in Chile occur in a small number of source areas. Those affecting coastal regions are generally aligned offshore from Concepción southward, with the major epicenters producing a predictable pattern of seismic and tsunami effects.Lomnitz, Cinna; \\"Major earthquakes and tsunamis in Chile during the period 1535 to 1955\\"; International Journal of Earth Sciences, Vol. 59, No. 3; abstract. The first systematic seismological recordings in Chile began after an earthquake and fire devastated Valparaiso in 1906.Moreno, Teresa. (2006). Earthquakes in northern Chile are known to have caused both uplift and subsidence of the continent. Large earthquakes of Magnitude 8 or more are associated with subsidence and drowning of the Chilean coast, except peninsulas and offshore islands. Magnitude 7 to 8 earthquakes with a source area near an internal boundary of the Earth known as the Moho are known to result in uplift of the coast. Earthquakes near the Moho may account for permanent deformation of the western edge of South American plate that accumulates into a long-term net uplift of the continent. =Quake clusters= Although the most powerful six quakes recorded were clustered in two time periods (a 12-year span from 1952 to 1964 and a seven-year span from 2004 to 2011), this is considered a statistical anomaly.Pappas, Stephanie. \\"Sumatra, Japan, Chile: Are Earthquakes Getting Worse?\\"; LiveScience; 11 March 2011. The phenomenon of comparably- large quakes on the same (or neighboring) faults within months of each other may be explained by geological mechanisms, but this does not fully demonstrate a relationship between events separated by longer periods and greater distancesBrahic, Catherine; \\"The mega-quake connection: Are huge earthquakes linked?\\"; New Scientist; UK; 16 March 2011.

Truchelut was sued for refusal to provide a good or a service: #due to the origin, whether belonging to it or not belonging to it, of an ethnicity or a determined nationality (on grounds that two women were wearing the veil) #due to one's belonging, or not belonging, to a determined race (on grounds that two women were wearing the veil) #due to one's belonging, or not belonging, to a determined religion (on grounds that two women were wearing the veil) Presidential candidate Philippe de Villiers offered free legal services to Fanny Truchelut. The trial began on October 2, 2007, and October 9 she was convicted, fined 5800 euros, and sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The case was unsuccessfully appealed. In France, the case has been treated as symbolic of the Islamization of French society, the loss of control over private property, and new threats to the rights of women. In an open letter to President Sarkozy published on website Riposte laïque, Truchelut focuses on the rights of women.

Depending upon sense-of-humour, some may use the phrase with mild irony. For example: The two had been fighting for a month, but around others it was all sweetness and light.Christine Ammer, The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1997). P. G. Wodehouse, esteemed humorous writer employed the phrase often, sometimes with a slight nod to the phrase's dual-edge. Originally, however, \\"sweetness and light\\" had a special use in literary and cultural criticism meaning \\"pleasing and instructive\\", which in classical theory was considered to be the aim and justification of poetry.English for dulce et utile (literally \\"sweet and useful\\") from Horace's Ars Poetica (18 B.C.E.) Jonathan Swift first used the phrase in his mock-heroic prose satire, \\"The Battle of the Books\\" (1704), a defense of Classical learning, which he published as a prolegomenon to his A Tale of a Tub. It gained widespread currency in the Victorian era, when English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold picked it up as the title of the first section of his 1869 book Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism, where \\"sweetness and light\\" stands for beauty and intelligence, the two key components of an excellent culture. Genesis \\"The Battle of the Books\\" spoofed the famous seventeenth-century Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, a controversy that had raged first in France and then, less intensely, in England, about which was better the Ancient or Modern learning. Should people still model their writings and artistic productions on Greek and Latin authors? Or should they study the (moderns from the Renaissance on), who used living vernacular languages (not dead ones) and produced practical inventions, and new artistic genres that could be read by everyone. In On Ancient and Modern Learning (1697), Swift's patron, the urbane Sir William Temple, had weighed in on the losing side, that of the Ancients, repeating the famous paradox used by Newton that we moderns see further only because we are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants. Swift has the books come to life and step down from the library shelves to stage a mock- Homeric battle, while the goddess Criticism, a hideous hag, intervenes on the side of her beloved \\"Moderns\\" in the manner of the Olympians of yore. Midway through the story, Aesop, an ancient book, stumbles on a debate between a bee and a spider. The spider claims that the bee creates nothing of its own, whereas the spider is an original creator who \\"spins and spits wholly from himself, and scorns to own any obligation or assistance from without\\" and his web is a triumph of architecture and mathematics. The bee counters that the spider's web is spun from digested flies and other dirt and that all the spider really contributes is his poison. Bees range far and wide to search out the very best flowers, which they do not harm, while the spider only moves four inches and feeds on insects and other \\"vermin of the age\\".The age-old comparison of artistic creation to the bee gathering flowers derives from Seneca's Moral letters to Lucilius, No 84. Aesop judges the argument. The ancient writers, Aesop says, are like bees who fill their \\"hives with honey and wax, thus furnishing mankind with the two noblest of things, which are sweetness and light.\\"Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books (New York: Modern Library, 1931) pag. 532. The Ancients \\"are content with the bee to pretend to nothing of [their] own, beyond…flights and…language.\\"Jonathan Swift, \\"The Battle of the Books\\", p. 532. That is, imitation of Ancient authors results in works filled with delight (sweetness) and moral wisdom (light). Later writers, notably Matthew Arnold used the phrase \\"sweetness and light\\", to designate the positive effects of a (predominantly classical) humanistic culture in arts and letters (without Swift's emphasis on originality versus imitation).  Popularization in cultural criticism The Victorian poet and essayist Matthew Arnold, who was also an inspector of schools, popularized Swift's phrase as the theme and title of the first chapter of his celebrated book of cultural criticism, Culture and Anarchy. Arnold contends that the most valuable aspect of civilization is its ability to confer \\"sweetness and light,\\" and he contrasts this to the moralism, hatred, and fanaticism of some of the would-be educators and materialistic improvers of mankind. For Arnold, sweetness is beauty, and light is intelligence – and together they make up \\"the essential character of human perfection,\\" which had its fullest development, he believed, among the ancient Greeks.\\"Indeed, the Greeks (albeit very selectively characterized) are the unacknowledged heroes of Culture and Anarchy\\", Stefan Collini, introduction to Culture and Anarchy and Other Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought) by Matthew Arnold, Stefan Collini, editor (Cambridge University Press, 1993) p. xx. Arnold criticizes the religious and utilitarian reformers of his own day for wanting only to improve humanity's moral and material condition, or for focusing \\"solely on the scientific passion for knowing,\\" while neglecting the human need for beauty and intelligence, which comes about through lifelong self-cultivation. Arnold concedes that the Greeks may have neglected the moral and material, but: > Greece did not err in having the idea of beauty and harmony and complete > human perfection so present and paramount; it is impossible to have this > idea too present and paramount; but the moral fiber must be braced too. And > we, because we have braced the moral fibre, are not on that account in the > right way, if at the same time the idea of beauty, harmony, and complete > human perfection is wanting or misapprehended amongst us; and evidently it > is wanting or misapprehended at present. And when we rely as we do on our > religious organisations, which in themselves do not and cannot give us this > idea, and think we have done enough if we make them spread and prevail, > then, I say, we fall into our common fault of overvaluing machinery.Matthew > Arnold, Culture & Anarchy, Jane Garner, ed. (Oxford World Classics, 2004), > p. 41. The phrase came into regular use as an English language idiom after the publication of Arnold's essay. Characterizing \\"Queen Anne\\" revival in architecture In 1977, architectural historian Mark Girouard used the title Sweetness and Light: The \\"Queen Anne\\" Movement, 1860–1900, for his book chronicling the comfortably eclectic architectural style of the middle-class brick country houses that late-nineteenth-century British artists and writers built for themselves. Here \\"sweetness and light\\" implied that taste and beauty need not be restricted only to the wealthy aristocracy but could benefit all classes of society. Mundane pleasantry During the 20th and 21st centuries, the phrase \\"sweetness and light\\" has more typically been used, not in Arnold's sense, but more mundanely, to indicate merely a friendly demeanor or a pleasant situation. Bob's close friends knew he wasn't all sweetness and light. Or: Our time at the opera was all sweetness and light. The phrase is often used ironically to denote unexpected or insincere pleasantness. The novel's tense moments are offset by long passages of sweetness and light. Or: Fred was all sweetness and light around his ex-wife.

Synopsis An aged king who is a widower lavishes indulgence on his only son, who the people consequently call \\"Prince Darling.\\" He fears he will die before the child is of age and confesses his concern to his friend, the Fairy of Truth. The fairy promises to grant the boy a boon such as beauty, wealth or military success, but the king asks only that the fairy make the boy a good person. The fairy says she cannot change the boy's character, but she can give him advice and correct him when he errs. After the king's death, the fairy appears to Prince Darling, now the king, and gives him a magic ring that will prick his finger whenever he does wrong. Prince Darling continues to follow the instructions of his wise old mentor, Suleiman, but begins carousing at night with power-seeking sycophants who encourage his bad behaviour. Prince Darling meets a young shepherdess and arrogantly announces to her that he will marry her. Instead of being honoured, the shepherdess refuses because of Prince Darling's wicked reputation. The sycophants tell him that if he won't punish subjects who disobey him, his power will dissolve and the people will depose him. By this time Prince Darling has discarded the magic ring because it was almost constantly pricking him. So he puts the shepherdess in prison to force her consent to the marriage. When she mysteriously vanishes from her cell, the sycophants accuse Suleiman of freeing her, and that he is trying to undermine Prince Darling's authority and take over the kingdom. Prince Darling then imprisons Suleiman. At this time the fairy of truth again appears to Prince Darling in a rage, saying that because he did not heed the ring's gentle correction he has become a monster. She transforms him into a beast with the body of a snake, the legs of a wolf, the head of a lion and the horns of a bull. The fairy tells him that as ugly as she can make him, his soul is still a hundred times more hideous. She disappears, and the creature is left alone in the woods to ruminate on the error of his ways. The monster prince is captured by a hunter, who hopes to sell him as a curiosity. On the way back to the town, they encounter a reveller who says the whole town is rejoicing because Prince Darling is dead. He says the people have released Suleiman from prison and crowned him as the new king. Prince Darling sees this as a confirmation of everything his flattering friends said, and roars in rage. The hunter decides to take the monster to the new king as a coronation gift. The hunter takes the monster prince to the coronation ceremony where they hear Suleiman announce that he is only taking the throne in trust for Prince Darling, who is not dead and will return one day. The hunter presents the monster to the king, who puts it in his menagerie. In his cage, Prince Darling observes that the animal keeper is a drunkard who abuses the animals. Prince Darling reflects that he was wrong about Suleiman, who only has his best interests in mind. He realizes that his friends were really the ones manipulating him and seeking power, and the prince resolves to do only good from now on. When the animal keeper has a near-fatal accident, the prince monster breaks out of his cage to save him. The Fairy of Truth appears momentarily, saying that good actions will be rewarded, and transforms him from the horrible monster into a dog. The animal keeper takes the dog to King Suleiman to report that a miracle has happened. Suleiman's daughter takes a liking to the dog and decides to keep him herself. One morning the dog receives a spare breakfast of one dinner roll, which he takes out in the countryside. As he roams, he discovers a house of splendour, made of jewels. There are well-dressed people going into the building, but when they come out, they are thin and pale, wearing rags and apparently starving to death. One young girl crawling out of the palace passes the dog, and attempts to eat a blade of grass. The dog decides to give his roll to the girl. The girl tells the dog not to go in the house, because it is the Palace of Pleasure, and all the food is poisoned. The dog sees the shepherdess entering the palace and is desperate to save her. At this time, the Fairy of Truth appears and rewards his generosity by turning him into a dove. The dove prince flies around the palace, and through a window he sees the shepherdess, who suddenly vanishes in a puff of smoke. Resolving to find her, the dove flies all across the land. Eventually he spies her in a remote place, walking with an old beggar woman in rags. He flies down and lights on the shepherdess' finger, cooing. She remarks that it is the most beautiful dove in the world and that if it were a man, she would marry it. The beggar woman throws off her rags and reveals that she is the Fairy of Truth. She transforms the dove back into Prince Darling. The Prince kneels and begs the shepherdess for forgiveness. The fairy declares that the girl had always loved the prince, but didn't like his bad behaviour. Prince Darling and the shepherdess are then married, and Prince Darling resumes the throne to become a just and beloved ruler.

Her marriage probably signaled the subordination of Burgred to his father-in-law and the Saxon kingdom at a time when both Wessex and Mercia were suffering Danish (Viking) raids. Burgred also had ongoing problems with the Kingdom of Powys on his western border and in 853 Æthelwulf subjugated the Welsh state on Burgred's behalf. Repeated Danish incursions over the years gradually weakened Mercia militarily and in 868 Burgred was forced to call upon Æthelswith's brother King Æthelred of Wessex to assist him in confronting an entrenched Danish army at Nottingham.

From its foundation in 1762 until 1995 it was used by German Lutherans. Today the small vestry serves as an office for the Historic Chapels Trust and the church is available for hire for secular events. St George's was the fifth Lutheran church to be built in London. It is now the oldest surviving German Lutheran church in the United Kingdom. Category:Whitechapel Foundation and history The founder was Dietrich Beckman, a successful sugar boiler who put up half the money required to buy the site and erect the church. Beckman's cousin, Gustav Anton Wachsel from Halberstadt, became the first pastor. At the time, the street was called \\"Little Ayliffe Street\\" and the area was called \\"Goodman's Fields\\". The name of the street changed to \\"Alie Street\\" about 1800. This area of Whitechapel had many sugar refiners of German descent in the nineteenth century and they constituted most of the congregation. From 1853 the churchyard and crypt were closed, and no longer accepted burials. At its height, there were an estimated 16,000 German Lutherans in Whitechapel and the area was sometimes referred to as Little Germany. St George’s Church is the last remaining physical evidence of this major wave of immigration into East London. The last major influx of Germans to the area was in the 1930s, when, during the Nazi period, the pastor, Julius Rieger, set up a relief centre for Jewish refugees at St George’s. The theologian and anti-Nazi activist Dietrich Bonhoeffer preached here for a brief period in 1935, following the destruction of his own St Paul's church nearby. The St John and St Croix refugees In 1763 about 600 Germans from the Palatinate and Würzburg attempted to travel to the Virgin Islands of St John and St Croix. Unfortunately the officer in charge abandoned them in London with no money or resources and no knowledge of English. Gustav Anton Wachsel, Pastor of St George's church appealed for help on their behalf. The Tower of London gave them 200 tents to protect them from the rain, and there were charitable contributions of 600 pounds. King George III intervened and enabled them to travel to Carolina instead. Interior features The church retains a set of furnishings, mostly from the 18th century, including a set of box pews and a high central double-decker pulpit and sounding board. The coat-of-arms of King George III (pre-1801) and two carved timber commandment boards in German hang in the church. The Royal Arms were required to be erected in Anglican churches but were adopted by nonconformist congregations voluntarily, as a mark of loyalty. There are donations boards for the church and adjoining former church school and among the donors listed is the King of Prussia. The organ was built in 1886 by the Walcker family. They used the organ case of the previous organ (John England, 1794). When the organ was rebuilt in 1937, the case was reused. Bell tower The street frontage was crowned by a baroque bell tower in copper-covered timber. This was taken down in the 1930s at the insistence of the District Surveyor as unsafe and has not to date been replaced. A plain brick pediment and cement cross replaced it, somewhat diminishing the architecture of the frontage. The former location of the bell tower can still be discerned in the brickwork. The bell and weathervane from the tower were saved and remain in the church. Restoration Having fallen out of use by the congregation it was transferred in 1995 to the Historic Chapels Trust who understood a programme of conservative restoration and repair costing £600,000 generously assisted by English Heritage and a number of private foundations including the St Paul’s German Evangelical Church Trust Trust. Work included major roof repairs and delicate repairs to the brick walls which were showing signs of movement. The restoration was supervised by conservation architects Thomas Ford and Partners with structural engineers Alan Baxter Associates. Current uses The church is hired for organ recitals, filming, rehearsals and castings, concerts, occasional acts of worship by various congregations without their own church and for secular events, income from which helps to maintain the structure, as the church is not endowed. The vestry serves as an office of Historic Chapels Trust. The church Committee Room, named the Maezold Zimmer after a former pastor, is available for hire. Couples eligible to be married in Tower Hamlets may have religious marriages here and ceremonies may be conducted in German, English or Latin. An active committee of Friends of St George’s put on public events at the church and welcome new members. The church is available for guided group visits by appointment and has regular open days throughout the year. St George's Church Library & Parish Records Gustav von Anton's collection of books was kept in the vestry and with later additions to the library, came into the care of the Historic Chapels Trust with the building. They amounted to about 750 books, including early eighteenth-century prints of the Waisenhaus in Halle and Gottfried Keller's Die Leute von Seldwyla. In autumn 1995 an unsuccessful attempted theft prompted the transfer of the books to the British Library where they are catalogued as a special collection and available to students. Books and microfiches available for baptisms 1763 - 1895 and other parish records for family history research are no longer held at the church but may be consulted at LB Tower Hamlets Central Library See also *List of chapels preserved by the Historic Chapels Trust External links * St George's German Church website of Friends of St Georges * www.hct.org.uk St Georges German Lutheran Church official website * History of the Walcker family * Germans in Whitechapel * the St John refugees * The British Library collection of books from St George's Category:Churches completed in 1762 Category:18th-century Lutheran churches Category:Protestant congregations established in the 18th century Category:Grade II* listed churches in London Category:Grade II* listed buildings in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:Churches in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:Lutheran churches in London Category:Churches preserved by the Historic Chapels Trust Category:Buildings and structures in Whitechapel Category:18th-century churches in the United Kingdom ","title":"St George's German Lutheran Church"},{"id":"13693777","text":"Where I Belong is the debut full-length album by Australian Christian rock band Revive.

The inscriptions The inscriptions record two treaties that \\"list curses and magical rites which take effect if the treaty is violated.\\" One is a treaty between two minor kings, Barga'yah and Matti'el, who hailed from the southwestern periphery of the Assyrian empire. In the text, Matti'el swears to accept dire consequences for himself and his cities should he violate the stipulations of the treaty: > \\".... > As this wax is consumed by fire, thus Ma[tti'el] shall be consumed b[y > fi]re. > As this bow and these arrows are broken, thus Inurta and Hadad (= names of > local deities) shall break [the bow of Matti'el] and the bows of his nobles. > As a man of wax is blinded, thus Matti'el shall be blinded. > [As] this calf is cut up, thus Matti'el and his nobles shall be cut up.\\" This loyalty oath from the Sefire inscriptions is similar to other loyalty oaths imposed by Assyrian kings on other less powerful monarchs in the Levant throughout the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. The inscriptions may, under one possible interpretation, record the names of El and Elyon, \\"God, God Most High\\" possibly providing prima facie evidence for a distinction between the two deities first worshipped by the Jebusites in Jerusalem, and then elsewhere throughout the ancient Levant. Thought to be reflective of Assyrian or neo- Assyrian culture and similar to other documents dating from the first millennium BCE, scholars such as Joseph Fitzmyer have perceived Canaanite influences in the text, while Dennis McCarthy has noted similarities to second millennium BCE treaties imposed by Hittite kings on Syrian vassals. = Identification of the treaty kings = Two treaties conducted between minor kings from the Kingdom of Arpad inscribed on the stelae are often cited as evidence of the Aramaean tradition of treaty-making. The Sefire inscriptions are of interest to those studying beliefs and practices in ancient Syria and Palestine and the text is considered notable for constituting \\"the best extrabiblical source for West Semitic traditions of covenantal blessings and curses.\\" They tell of \\"The treaty of King Bar-ga'yah of K[a]t[a]k, with Mati'el son of Attarsamak, king of Arpad.\\" Some have identified this as the treaty of \\"Ashurnerari V\\" (Adad-nirari III or his son Tiglath-pileser III?) of Assyria and Matiilu (unknown) of Arpad (probably modern Tel Rifaat, Syria).Steven Elliott Grosby Biblical ideas of nationality: ancient and modern 2002 p126 \\"Thus, they think that the Sefire treaty is the Aramaic version of the treaty of approximately 754 bc between Ashurnerari V and Matîoil of Arpad.

They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only in the sense that at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant- voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance speaker systems. In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100 V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100 V. Operation Constant-voltage speaker systems are analogous to electrical power transmission methods employed by electric utility companies to transmit electric power over long distances. Typically, an electric utility will step up the voltage of the power transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current, hence reducing the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system, the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step- down transformer to reduce the voltage to a usable level. Loudspeaker connection Each loudspeaker's step-down transformer can be designed for a single power level or it can have multiple taps, one of which is selected to match the desired power level to be applied to the loudspeaker. Transformers with various taps allow the installer to adjust the sound pressure level up or down at an individual loudspeaker. Purpose-built models are available that have the transformer contained within the loudspeaker enclosure. The loudspeaker step-down transformer primary is connected in parallel to the constant-voltage line.Crown Engineering staff (October 2005). Crown Audio. Guide to Constant-Voltage Systems Amplifier connection Constant-voltage lines can be driven by a conventional amplifier with external step-up transformer, an amplifier with an internal step-up transformer or a high- voltage amplifier with transformerless output. =External step-up transformer= A general-purpose amplifier with typical low-impedance output is used. Its output is connected to the primary of an external step-up transformer. Special-purpose transformers can tailor the system design to the project's target power levels. Multiple amplifiers can be combined together via transformers to yield higher voltage and higher current capacity lines. For instance, three 70-volt amplifiers have been used to make a 210-volt line by connecting them to a special-purpose external output transformer that has three primaries and a single secondary.Edcor Electronics. TEK-NOTES V1.0 1997-2004 =Internal step-up transformer= Amplifiers with built-in 70-volt output transformers are available with low impedance and high impedance output connections, the latter typically labeled \\"25 V\\" and \\"70 V\\". These are robust, purpose-built amplifiers with many application-specific design features such as overcurrent protection and aggressive high-pass filtering for flyback voltage protection. Some models can be configured so that one channel drives one or two low impedance 8-ohm speakers while the other drives a constant- voltage string of speakers. =High voltage transformerless= With advances in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage directly from the output stage of the amplifier. For example, in 1967 Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall powerDC300 manual, page 1 of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since then, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices. Many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a high-impedance constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage audio amplifiers have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V peak to peak signals, but have relatively low current output, so a standard circuit includes a Darlington or FET discrete output stage. Higher power levels High-voltage constant-voltage systems can be designed to use 140-, 200- and 210-volt lines, depending on the transformers selected and the amplifier connection topology. Such high voltage systems have been used in locations where small diameter wire is already in place, where long-distance wire runs are involved and at especially loud installations such as Daytona International SpeedwayBogen. Applications. Power Rules for Speakers At Daytona Speedway and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway prior to its redesign in 2003. Safety considerations in such high voltages require speaker line installation within conduit in most of the world. 600 watt transformers are widely available for contractors needing high power loudspeakers in constant-voltage installations. Special-purpose transformers capable of handling 1250 watts down as low as 50 Hz are available. One problem with high power, high current transformers is that fewer can be used on a single constant-voltage line. Larger diameter speaker wire is recommended. Larger transformers needed for high power handling have reduced high-frequency response. Alternatives The traditional alternative to constant-voltage speaker systems are low impedance speaker systems (commonly referred to as \\"8-ohm speaker systems\\" in spite of the fact that their impedance may not be 8 ohms), in which the amplifier and speaker are directly coupled without the use of transformers. The disadvantages relative to constant-voltage systems are that speaker cables need to be shorter or larger in diameter and that more amplifiers are needed if different listening levels are desired at different locations. Another alternative are powered speakers with an amplifier built into the speaker enclosure. Since the amplifier is at the same location as the speaker, the speaker requires only a line level audio signal as an input. Line level signals are typically around 1-2 volts, and can be transmitted over much smaller cable (typically 20-26 AWG). The main disadvantage of powered loudspeakers is that they have the additional requirement of requiring AC power, whereas passive speakers have no such requirement. Advantages The main advantages of using a constant-voltage speaker system over a conventional low impedance speaker system are: * Multiple loudspeakers: Many loudspeakers can be driven by a single amplifier without complex series/parallel connection schemes.John Eargle, Chris Foreman. JBL Audio Engineering for Sound Reinforcement (2002) * Multiple power levels: Different sound pressure level targets can be achieved at different listening areas while still using a single amplifier. * Less expensive: Since the voltage of the signal has been stepped up and the current is relatively low, lighter, less expensive cable can be used without incurring additional power loss. Where a typical 8-ohm speaker system might require 12 gauge cable, a 70-volt system could use 18 gauge or smaller cable. * System expansion: A 70-volt system can be expanded easily. * Easy volume adjustment: A passive volume control may be installed to give the user easy level control over a single loudspeaker or a multiple- speaker zone. Disadvantages *Frequency Response: Inexpensive transformers may have poor reproduction of low and high frequencies. *Distortion: Overdriven transformers can add ringing distortion to the audio signal. Low cost transformers are prone to distortion at higher power levels, especially with regard to low frequency response. Low level signals can fail to energize a poorly designed transformer core enough to prevent higher than normal amounts of harmonic distortion. *Variation: Unit-to-unit variation can be observed in poorly made transformers. *Delay: More distant speakers on the same constant-voltage line cannot be delayed to match the speed of sound in air to make the impulses from a string of loudspeakers arrive at the same time from the point of view of a distant listener. *Insertion loss: The transformers themselves commonly reduce total power applied to the loudspeakers, requiring the amplifier to be some 10% to 20% more powerful than the total power that is intended to be applied to the loudspeakers. Typical transformer insertion loss measurements are taken at 1,000 Hz to optimize the transformer's specifications. Using this method, typical insertion losses are about 1 dB, a 20% power loss. Most of the power in voice-application audio systems is below 400 Hz, meaning that insertion loss at lower frequencies would be greater. The best transformers reduce mid-band frequencies by 0.5 dB (approximately 10% power loss) or less, resulting in a ten watt loudspeaker drawing 11.1 watts from the amplifier. *Capacitance: To achieve higher power levels, transformers must be physically larger. Large transformers (above 200 watts) begin to suffer from high frequency attenuation due to self- capacitance. *More expensive: If high-power loudspeakers are used with an emphasis on low frequency response, the required transformers will be much larger and will add significant cost to the project. In some areas, building and electrical codes require 70-volt cabling to be carried within conduit, increasing the project cost. *More sensitive: Since constant-voltage systems operate at relatively high impedances, they are more sensitive to small amounts of leakage current and partial short circuits. Running 70-volt speaker lines in conduit that collect water can result in crackling sounds in the system.

It is the seat of the Earl of Radnor, and an example of the Elizabethan prodigy house.  History  In 1573 Thomas Gorges acquired the manor (at the time written \\"Langford\\"), which was originally owned by the Servington (or Cervington) family.Jacob Radnor, A Huguenot Family 1536–1889 Prior to this the existing mansion house had been damaged by fire. In c.1576 Thomas Gorges married Helena Snakenborg, the Swedish born dowager Marchioness of Northampton and Lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth. They rebuilt the Longford property as a triangular Swedish pattern castle on the banks of the River Avon. The building work became very expensive due to problems with the subsoil. Sir Thomas Gorges, who was now governor of Hurst Castle, persuaded his wife to beg of the Queen a shipwreck he knew from the defeated Spanish Armada. The gift was granted and the gold and silver retrieved from the shipwreck funded the completion of the castle under the final supervision of John Thorpe in 1591. The family lived in the castle for several years before its final completion. The main building had several floors and was triangular with a round tower in each corner; the three towers representing the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. There was a chapel, kitchen department, several boudoirs and sitting rooms, as well as bedrooms. Fresh cold water was pumped to various floors and there were water closets operating with rainwater. A park, fruit garden and kitchen garden were attached. In 1717 Longford Castle became the Bouverie home, purchased by Sir Edward des Bouverie from the Coleraines. It is said that Sir Edward saw and fell in love with the castle in the valley as he rode past, having enough money in his saddle bags to effect the purchase there and then. Subsequent generations of the family beautified the interior of the castle and surrounding park; by 1773 the castle was surrounded by a formal park, laid out with avenues and rides. Landscaping advice was sought from Lancelot Brown around 1777. However, Jacob, 2nd Earl of Radnor (1749–1828), employed James Wyatt to change Longford from a reasonably modest chateau into a hexagonal palace \\"to the despair of future generations\\". He destroyed one of the Elizabethan towers and replaced it with a larger one of his own design, added two more towers and linked each to each other. In 1832 the 3rd Earl created a new formal garden to the south of the castle, in 17th-century style. The palace concept was not finished: it was Jacob, 4th Earl of Radnor (1815–1889), who oversaw the last significant changes to the castle architecture, undertaken by Anthony Salvin. These included the formation of a second courtyard, the doming over of the central courtyard, the addition of a square tower, and alterations to the formal garden.  Present day  The castle is Grade I listed and is within Odstock parish. The formal garden, pleasure grounds and park extend into neighbouring parishes and are listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The castle is the seat of William Pleydell-Bouverie, 9th Earl of Radnor, and is open to the public for pre-booked tours on 28 days of each year.

Several extinct species within the Suidae are classified in subfamilies other than Suinae.

It is a weed of national significance in Australia and on the list of invasive alien species of union concern in the EU. Common names Cabomba caroliniana is commonly called Carolina fanwort, Carolina water shield, green cabomba, fanwort, fish grass, and Washington grass. Distribution It is native to southeastern South America (southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northeastern Argentina),Department of Ecology, Washington State: Cabomba caroliniana . Non-Native Invasive Freshwater Plants. Retrieved 16 August 2016 and the East and West Coasts of the United States. It is eaten as a vegetable in some areas. Ecological aspects This species grows rooted in the mud of stagnant to slow-flowing water, including streams, smaller rivers, lakes, ponds, sloughs, and ditches. In some states in the United States, it is now regarded as a weed. Fanwort stems become brittle in late summer, which causes the plant to break apart, facilitating its distribution and invasion of new water bodies. It produces by seed, but vegetative reproduction seems to be its main vehicle for spreading to new waters. Growth of a day has been reported in Lake Macdonald in Queensland, Australia.Global Invasive Species Database Large numbers of plants are sent from Florida to the rest of the U.S. for commercial use. Fanwort is also grown commercially in Asia for export to Europe and other parts of the world. Small- scale, local cultivation occurs in some areas, and aquarists are probably responsible for some introductions. Description Fanwort is a submerged, sometimes floating, but often rooted, freshwater perennial plant with short, fragile rhizomes. The erect shoots are upturned extensions of the horizontal rhizomes. The shoots are grass-green to olive-green or sometimes reddish brown. The leaves are of two types: submerged and floating. The submerged leaves are finely divided and arranged in pairs on the stem. The floating leaves, when present, are linear and inconspicuous, with an alternate arrangement. They are less than long and narrow (less than ). The leaf blade attaches to the centre, where a slight constriction is seen. The flowers are white and small (less than in diameter), and are on stalks which arise from the tips of the stems.

Santi Pietro e Paolo a Via Ostiense is one of the titular churches in Rome, to which Cardinal-Priests are appointed. It is a modern building at Piazzale dei Santi Pietro e Paolo 8 in EUR (Esposizione Universale Roma). It is at the west end of the Viale Europa, the last two blocks of which is a monumental approach reserved for pedestrians and paved with polychrome marble. There are colossal statues of the apostles Peter and Paul near the church. History Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967 The title was established on 5 February 1965 by Pope Paul VI. The original scheme was part of the 1936 Fascist scheme for hosting the World Exhibition in 1942, which never took place because of World War II but which left a legacy of monumental buildings in a rather megalomaniac layout. The church was planned for a high point at the west end of the site, and was entrusted to a committee of architects: Arnaldo Foschini, Alfredo Energici, Vittorio Grassi, Nello Ena, Tullio Rossi and Costantino Vetriani. They chose a plan based on a Greek cross, in deliberate emulation of the original plan for the new St Peter’s by Michelangelo. Construction began in 1939, but was delayed by the war and by a lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Diocese to be involved. It was only completed in 1955, and became a parish church in 1958. Apparently, the original function of this building was to be the mausoleum of Mussolini. The parish is administered by the Franciscan Conventuals. The cardinalate title is Santi Pietro e Paolo in Via Ostiense, and the present titular is Pedro Barreto. Ricardo Vidal, Cardinal-Priest from 1985 to 2017 Exterior The site is on a ridge overlooking the Tiber valley, and sloping down to the main area of the EUR on the other side. It is in the north-west corner of the EUR, and is not very conveniently situated; the intention of the planners was that the building should be visible from afar. The monumental approach from the east side, up a slope, The edifice is a cube in brown brick with stone trim, and with four gigantic pylons attached to each face forming the Greek cross. These pylons are banded with six horizontal stone string courses. The hemispherical dome is covered in hexagonal tiles and sits on a drum having six rectangular recesses containing porthole windows. The lantern is a cylinder with fourteen rectangular slits, capped with a conical finial crowned by a statue of Our Lady. The entrance is in the eastern pylon, and in the enormous rectangular recess above the doors is a relief of the resurrected Christ with the apostles. Immediately above the door is the Confession of Peter in Latin, and above the recess is a dedicatory inscription. Interior Apart from a marble dado, all the interior surfaces are painted in a uniform light brownish yellow and have developed surface cracks. The dome is coffered with a cross motif, has a stained glass window in the oculus showing a cross. There are eight round windows in the dome's drum. The interior is dominated by the mosaic of Christ in glory over the main altar. The left-hand side chapel is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception and contains a mosaic of the Madonna and Child venerated by angels, while the right-hand one is dedicated to St Francis of Assisi and contains a mosaic of him and other Franciscan saints. There are reliefs depicting the Evangelists at the cardinal points.

Diagram B shows a \\"perched\\" sump, which could be alt=Two sectional diagrams illustrating the concept of a sump. Diagram \\"A\\" illustrates a U-shaped passage with water filling the rounded bottom section, blocking the dry passage either side. Diagram \\"B\\" shows a passage blocked similarly by a sump, but on one side the water level is being held back by a natural dam, with dry passage continuing beyond, below the water level of the sump. A sump, or siphon, is a passage in a cave that is submerged under water. A sump may be static, with no inward or outward flow, or active, with continuous through-flow. Static sumps may also be connected underwater to active stream passage. When short in length, a sump may be called a duck, however this can also refer to a section or passage with some (minimal) airspace above the water. Depending on hydrological factors specific to a cave – such as the sea tide, changes in river flow, or the relationship with the local water table – sumps and ducks may fluctuate in water level and depth (and sometimes in length, due to the shape of adjacent passage).  Exploration past a sump  = Diving = Short sumps may be passed simply by holding one's breath while ducking through the submerged section (for example, Sump 1 in Swildon's Hole). This is known as \\"free diving\\" and can only be attempted if the sump is known to be short and not technically difficult (e.g. constricted or requiring navigation). Longer and more technically difficult sumps can only be passed by cave diving (as happened repeatedly in the exploration of Krubera Cave). = Draining = When practical, a sump can also be drained using buckets, pumps or siphons. Pumping the water away requires the inward flow of water into the sump to be less than the rate at which the pump empties it, as well as a suitable place to collect the emptied water. Upstream sumps have been successfully emptied using hoses to siphon water out of them, such as at the Sinkhole Dersios during exploration in 2005. The water was sent deeper into the sinkhole, and the emptied sumps revealed virgin passage behind them. During a rescue from beyond a downstream sump at Sarkhos Cave in 2002, water was pumped upstream into a dam constructed a few metres above the flooded passage. Some manuals also mention the use of explosives or other forms of force to empty sumps, but the ecological damage done to the fragile cave environment usually rules out the use of such methods.

In 1851 he passed the examination for the diploma of fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and in 1854 he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians, London, and in 1863 was elected a fellow of the college. Apparatus that Edward Smith built to monitor the quantity of carbon dioxide exhaled by the human body Physiological chemistry occupied much of his attention and he developed an early spirometer. In 1856 he read his first paper. Edward was very interested in the workings of the human body and would frequently take measurements of his own body temperature and pulse, sometimes over fifty times a day. He later became interested in the body's use of urea and again made over 1400 different observations. Detailed study of his work at nutrition.org accessed 8 October 2007 Meanwhile Smith, in 1853, held the office of lecturer and demonstrator of anatomy at the Charing Cross Hospital school of medicine, and was appointed in 1861 assistant physician to the Brompton Hospital for Consumption. In 1860 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society In 1862 he published Consumption: its Early and Remediable Stages. He had previously published several papers on the pulse and the use of certain remedies in phthisis. Dietetics formed the subject of most of his subsequent literary work. He looked at the diet of prisoners, particularly those who were subjected to using a treadmill such as the one in Brixton prison. He decided to go to prison and join the others to investigate the diet in the prison system. He inspired two German researchers to investigate the prevailing idea that protein alone powered muscles. Adolf Eugen Fick and Johannes Wislicenus climbed the Swiss Alps after removing protein entirely from their diet. They were then able to balance the food they had consumed against the gain in potential energy.Ira Wolinsky, Nutrition in Exercise and Sport, 1998 CRC Press, They were able to show as Smith had suggested that the chemical energy required for muscular effort does not come primarily from consumed protein but from fats and carbohydrates.Cambridge World of Food accessed 13 October 2007 Edward Smith died of pneumonia in 1874.

The suspect is then either released without charges or the suspect receives a sentence that is similar to a sentence given to a person charged with a misdemeanor. Florida In a 2001 article, the St. Petersburg Times reported a drifter convicted of murder fifteen years ago had his conviction overturned. The original sentence was based on circumstantial evidence. The reporter refers to the original case as the kind lawyers call a \\"misdemeanor murder\\" due to lack of sympathy for the victim who was a teenage crack addict and prostitute, but, in this case, the suspect was imprisoned based on circumstantial evidence and false testimony.Man on death row gets new trial David Karp, St. Petersburg Times, 2001-11-03 Louisiana New Orleans is often accused of institutionalized \\"misdemeanor murder.\\" Article 701 of the criminal code requires the state to release a defendant who has not been charged with a crime after 60 days.Misdemeanor Murder Do Not Pass Geaux, 2007-04-13New Orleans murder rate for year will set record Ethan Brown, Guardian Unlimited, 2007-11-06 Before Hurricane Katrina a few hundred people per year were released under article 701. In 2006, after Katrina, there were over 3,000 article 701 releases although the population had dropped from around 500,000 to around 250,000. Causes include inexperienced prosecutors, inexperienced police officers, poor processing procedures, poor tracking procedures, incomplete reports, missing evidence and an undermanned police force. New Orleans also has a problem with witnesses that go missing before trial and a crime lab that was destroyed during Katrina and () has yet to be repaired.Crime thrives under 60-day rule Gwen Filosa, The Times-Picayune, 2007-02-12 All of this results in an effective sentence of 60 days for those suspected of murder. Texas In East Texas, criminal defense attorney, Percy Foreman (1902-1988) made a career out of \\"defending thieves, murderers, and wayward spouses\\". He had an impressive record among those charged with committing capital offenses, which he called \\"misdemeanor murder\\". Out of nearly 1,500 men and women facing the death sentence, he lost only one to execution. A Texas legislator once said, \\"Nobody who has the money to hire Percy Foreman has any real fear of the death penalty.\\"Percy Foreman Michael Dorman, King of the Courtroom: Percy Foreman for the Defense (New York, 1969), via the East Texas Historical Association, accessed 2007-12-06 The Dallas Morning News found that at least 120 times from 2000 through 2006 probation was given instead of a sentence of murder. In Dallas County twice as many murderers were put on probation as were sent to death row. Forty-seven people or nine percent in the county were placed on probation instead of in prison for murder. Most of these murder-probations are given to minorities who murder minorities, especially when the victim had engaged in illegal or immoral activity and when the victim has no relatives or friends. Defense lawyers are able to reduce sympathy for the victim. If the defense lawyer can then induce sympathy for the defendant, a plea bargain will result. This process is aided by the jury system used in Texas, as juries can be easier to persuade than judges. Prosecutors cooperate in order to reduce caseload, knowing the suspects will most likely violate probation making them easier to prosecute later.Unequal Justice: Murderers on Probation Brooks Egerton and Reese Dunklin, The Dallas Morning News, 2007-11-10 See also * Manslaughter * Misdemeanor * Murder  Legal cases using \\"misdemeanor murder\\"  * Court Opinions, PEOPLE of the State of New York v.

The footstone lies opposite the headstone, which is usually the primary grave marker. As indicated, these markers are usually stone, though modern footstones are often made of concrete, or some metal (usually bronze) in the form of a cast plate, which may or may not be set in concrete. The footstone may simply mark the foot of a grave, serving as a boundary marker for the grave plot, but more often provide additional information about the interred decedent. A footstone usually contains the initials of the person whose grave it marks. United States In the United States, when a member or veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces dies, the federal government will provide and install a headstone inscribed with the veteran's name and relevant military information, at no cost to the family. In many cases, the veteran and/or the veteran's family decide to purchase a larger and more personalized gravestone at their own expense. The family then has the option of requesting a flat marker, which can be used as a footstone, from the federal government for the grave of the veteran. The preferred marker in these cases is a bronze plaque with the veteran's name and military information, and is often bolted to a granite base and set at the foot of a grave. This optional footstone is preferred by families who want a personal headstone over the grave, but still want the grave marked with official recognition of the veteran's service.

Recent scholarship has uncovered that it \\"was almost certainly the most widely read single work of fiction in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and attracted more readers than did the novels of Dickens, Bulwer-Lytton or Trollope.\\" There are many plots in the story, but the overarching purpose is to reveal different facets of life in London, from its seedy underbelly to its over-indulgent and corrupt aristocrats. Reynolds wrote the first two series of this long-running narrative. Thomas Miller wrote the third series and Edward L. Blanchard wrote the fourth series of this immensely popular title. The original text was published serially in 52 weekly parts. Installments were published weekly and contained a single illustration and eight pages of text printed in double columns. Upon its conclusion in 1845 all the parts were bound together in volume form and sold as a book by George Vickers of London.

That he was Alfred's younger son by Ealhswith is stated by Asser in his biography of the king ( 893).Asser, Vita Ælfredi, ch. 75. Asser also provides valuable detail on the boy's upbringing. Whereas his brother Edward and sister Ælfthryth were raised and educated at court, Æthelweard was sent to a type of school (schola), where he learned to read and write both Latin and Old English and was instructed in the liberal arts \\"under the attentive care of teachers, in company with all the nobly born children of virtually the entire area, and a good many of lesser birth as well.\\" Such education would have started at an early age, before the onset of adolescence.Asser, Vita Ælfredi, ch. 75.

In his father's will (AD 873 x 888), in which he is unnamed but called Alfred's \\"younger son\\" (þam gingran minan suna ), he is the beneficiary of a vast number of estates across the south of Britain: Arreton (Isle of Wight), Dean (i.e. East Dean or West Dean, West Sussex), Meon (i.e. East Meon or West Meon, Hampshire), Amesbury (Wiltshire), Dean (probably West Dean, Wiltshire), Sturminster Marshall (Dorset), Yeovil (Somerset), Crewkerne (Somerset), Whitchurch Canonicorum (Dorset), Axmouth (Devon), Branscombe (Devon), Cullompton (Devon), Tiverton (Devon), Mylenburnan (probably Burn in Silverton, Devon), Exminster (Devon), Suðeswyrðe (possibly Lustleigh, Devon), Lifton (Devon) and appurtenant lands, i.e. all his father's property in Cornwall, except Triggshire.S 1507. The identification of the estates here is based on the corresponding notes to the translation by Keynes and Lapidge. Since the (late) 890s, Æthelweard attested several of his brother's charters.See According to John of Worcester, he died on 16 October 922 and his body received burial at Winchester,John of Worcester, Chronicon, sub anno 922. where he was soon joined by his brother Edward (d. 924). William of Malmesbury confirms the place of burial, but places his death four years before Edward's.William of Malmesbury, Gesta regumm. II ch. 130. It may have been Æthelweard whose name was entered into the New Minster Liber Vitae, fol. 9v., with the designation clito \\"ætheling\\", but if so, he seems to be mistaken for a son of Edward. William tells that Æthelweard had two sons, Æthelwine and Ælfwine, who died fighting in the Battle of Brunanburh and who were buried at Malmesbury, at the behest of their cousin King Athelstan, who was buried there himself only two years later.William of Malmesbury, Gesta regumm. II ch. 135. The connection with this house is prominent in a series of three spurious charters from the Malmesbury archive, in which Athelstan is made to endow the abbey in memory of his \\"cousins\\" (patruelia) Æthelweard, Ælfwine and Æthelwine.S 434, 435, 436 (AD 937).

Her crew was able to flood her forward gunpowder magazine but could not reach her aft magazine. When it became clear that the ship could not be saved, her crew abandoned ship, and Magenta′s aft magazine exploded shortly afterward, 2 hours 55 minutes after the fire broke out. She sank in 15 meters (49 feet) of water. At the time of the accident, Magenta had a cargo of Carthaginian antiques, notably 2080 Punic stelae (Tophet, 2nd century BC) and a marble statue of Vibia Sabina (Thasos, c. 127-128 AD), found in 1874 by the Pricot de Sainte-Marie mission. The wreck was located in April 1994. Fragments of stelae have since been recovered. The statue has been partially recovered, though the head was too damaged to be rejoined to the rest of the statue. The fragments are on display at the Louvre in Paris.

It lies close to the scenic Aberglaslyn Pass and the Welsh Highland Railway. Nantmor station has re-opened, following a 2007 vote in its favour by local residents. A car park run by the National Trust is a popular starting point for walks up Cwm Bychan or along the Aberglaslyn. The village is perhaps most famous for being the home of Dafydd Nanmor, a renowned 15th century bard (died c. 1490), who took his name from the hamlet, as did Rhys Nanmor after him. Dafydd Nanmor himself was possibly a bardic student of Rhys Goch, who lived at neighbouring Hafod Garegog. Filmed in Nantmor in 1957 the Inn of the Sixth Happiness is a 1958 British 20th Century Fox film based on the true story of Gladys Aylward, a tenacious British maid, who became a missionary in China during the tumultuous years leading up to the Second World War.

The brigade is based at the port town of Volos in Thessaly, and its primary role is infantry and amphibious operations on the numerous islands off the Greek coast. Unlike other countries, the Greek Marines form part of the Army, while the landing craft and naval equipment are provided by the Hellenic Navy.  History  The unit traces its ancestry to the 32nd Infantry Regiment, formed in Preveza in 1919, then belonging to the 8th Infantry Division. It took part in the Greco-Turkish War as part of the Kydoniai Division and the 5th Infantry Division, and later in the Greco- Italian War during the Second World War. After the occupation of Greece by the Germans, it was disbanded. In 1959 the Regiment was raised anew as the 132nd Light Infantry Regiment and moved to Attica as a reserve unit, but in 1967 was reorganized as a Marines unit under the name 32nd Marines Regiment. In January 1988, after the disbandment of the unified 3rd Special Forces Division, the unit was enlarged to brigade size. It is currently placed under the II Army Corps as part of the Greek Rapid Reaction Force. The 32nd Marines Brigade was established in 1988 after the reorganization of the Special Forces Command.  Uniform and Unit Insignia  Greek marines in 2009 All Marines wear the standard-issue Greek Lizard camouflage BDUs of the Hellenic Army. Members of the 32nd Marines Brigade originally wore the blue beret, but this was changed to the green beret in 2001 because of its Special Forces role. The blue beret was, subsequently, issued to infantry units. The unit insignia depicts the Argo, the ship of Jason and the Argonauts, and is representative of the first recorded Greek marine expedition. Brigade HQ is based at Volos, near the ancient Thessalian port city of Iolcos, from where the Argonauts embarked on their mission to retrieve the Golden Fleece. The unit flash is emblazoned with ΔΥΝΑΜΕΙΣ ΠΕΖΟΝΑΥΤΩΝ (Marine Forces).

It is located away from the center of Kusadak, on the left side of the old local way Kusadak-Glibovac-smederevska Palanka. In 1983 a local farmer Radmilo Jakovljević found human skeletons while plowing his field. Archeologists, led by Ratko Katunar, conducted excavations in June 1983 and came upon a medieval necropolis. They discovered 10 complete and 6 partial skeletons. The anthropological analysis by Slavica Krunić concluded that, of those complete skeletons, 4 were children's, 3 male, 2 female and 1 unidentified. The deceased were Christians and the burial date was estimated between the 11th and 13th century. Other discoveries in the surrounding area point to the existence of a Serbian-populated medieval settlement. After 35 years it was decided that, since all possible analysis were already conducted, the remains should be removed from the museum in Smederevska Palanka and reburied. It was a pioneering work in Serbia, as such findings usually remain in museum depots. After obtaining numerous special permits, both from the state and the church, the remains were reburied in the churchyard of the Pinosava Monastery in Kusadak on 9 March 2018. An appropriate ritual customs were conducted, including the burial a bit away from the existing graveyard and soaking of the remains in white wine. A commemorative gravestone will be erected later.

It is known from drillcore material that was collected from the Lower Cambrian of Kashubia, Poland at 4.8 kilometres depth. Etymology The species name is derived from the Latin words for \\"Lower Cambrian\\". The former genus name Pomerania refers to the Latinized name for Pomorze, a region of northern Poland. The replacement name for the preoccupied genus, Cassubia, is derived from the Latinization of Kaszuby, the region in Poland where the holotype specimen was discovered.  History  The holotype—and only—specimen was recovered from the Kościerzyna borehole, in the Cambrian Stage 3 aged Zawiszyn Formation. It was found in the Fallotaspis Zone making it older than the Chengjiang biota. It was described by Kazimiera Lendzion in 1975 and given the name Pomerania infercambriensis, a name which soon proved to be preoccupied by a Middle Jurassic ammonoid. In her initial description, Lendzion interpreted the fossil as preserving 11 thoracic segments and a chelicera of a Leanchoilia-like arthropod. Subsequent study identified it as an anomalocaridid-like frontal appendage. At first, the portion originally identified as thoracic segments was interpreted as representing the base of an elongate appendage, but it appears to be the body of an indeterminate arthropod. Classification Peytoia infercambriensis may represent a transitional form between taxa with two rows of similar ventral spines such as Anomalocaris pennsylvanica and taxa with highly differentiated ventral spines such as Peytoia nathorsti. It bears particular similarity to Anomalocaris pennsylvanica and Tamisiocaris borealis. Description The frontal appendage was made up of at least 18 segments and had long, straight ventral spines. It is not known whether the ventral spines were paired like in most related taxa. On the anterior edge of the spines were minute serrations which may form the bases of setae. Paleobiology If the ventral spines possessed setae, Peytoia infercambriensis may have used its frontal appendages to filter through fine sediment.

He had Kaykhusraw's two half-brothers strangled along with their mother, an Ayyubid princess, but he did not became successful and was later killed, some sources indicate he was hanged on the Seljuk palace walls for treason. It was also known that he wanted throne of Seljuqs and had made his connections with Mongols. He suspected the loyalty of the Khwarezmians, the remnant followers of Jalal al-Din Manguberti whom Kayqubad had installed in various Anatolian fortresses, and had their leader, a certain Kirkhan, imprisoned. The Khwarezmians abandoned their posts and fled to Diyar Mudar, where they applied to the Ayyubids for work as mercenaries.

It is one of two high schools in the Santa Paula Unified School District. The principal is Elizabeth Garcia. History The school was founded in 1889 as the Santa Paula Academy, a private school run by the Congregational Church Association. Between 1889 and 1891, the school expanded to become Santa Paula's first school offering education beyond elementary grades. The cornerstone was laid on April 24, 1889. The Santa Paula Academy was built with money contributed by Wallace L. Hardison, C.H. McKevett, J.M. Sharp, and N.W. Blanchard. Curriculum for the school included the Latin language, Greek and Roman history, medieval and modern history, English, algebra, trigonometry, chemistry, and physics. In 1891, the California state legislature provided for incorporation of union high school districts. The city of Santa Paula agreed with the Congregational Church Association to convert Santa Paula Academy to a public school and renamed it Santa Paula High School. Santa Paula High School expanded rapidly throughout the early 20th century. In 1905, the land between 6th and 7th streets was bought, but later exchanged for the ground between 5th and 6th streets in 1909. That year, there were only 100 students enrolled at Santa Paula High School. In 1912, the school purchased the land where the gymnasium now stands. Enrollment had increased to 125 students, and there were six faculty members. In 1914, a three-story concrete school was built with a concrete shop in the rear for vocational training. Every classroom now had electric clocks. The original frame building was moved to Briggs School, an elementary school just outside the city of Santa Paula. In 1924, a new study hall unit was added to the east side of the building, parallel to the auditorium unit in the center of campus. The school's football field, which opened in 1925, was dedicated by alumni of the football team as Jones Field in 1929. Also in 1929, the library was established in the study hall. By this time, the student body numbered about 250 and the faculty 20. In 1938, construction for the new campus plant began and was completed in the spring of 1939 with Spanish-style architecture. The following year, most of the current school buildings were built for $329,000 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In 1950, the school built a swimming pool and an industrial arts building. In 1957, a campus-wide remodeling project was completed, encompassing the boys' and girls' gymnasia, agriculture building, football field, cafeteria, administration offices, and health office. Enrollment at the time consisted of 1,063 students and faculty numbered 45. The 1990s saw a series of modernization and expansion projects at the campus. In 1990, voters in the Santa Paula Union High School District passed a $5 million school bond for construction with an approval rate of approximately 85%. Modernization Project I began in 1991. Using $2.7 million of state construction funding, the girls' gym and a majority of the classrooms in the Center and Upper Courts were renovated. Also added were an elevator, new classroom furniture, computers, and other technological improvements. One 15-classroom humanities building was completed at a cost of $2.1 million in 1994. Modernization Project II began in 1994. This phase consisted of improvements in the cafeteria, converting the former board room into a food preparation area and snack bar serving lines, constructing a covered eating area outside the cafeteria, converting the staff lounge into a student store, and building a band room in the old snack bar area under the cafeteria. The total cost of the project was $700,000. In 1995, SPHS began an $8 million, five-year expansion project. Added to the campus were a new band room, cafeteria, student store, and a three-story building for 15 classrooms. Activities Santa Paula High School offers a variety of extracurricular activities.

Licensed to Sanford, North Carolina, United States. The station is currently owned by Mary and Mark Dangerfield, through licensee Macadell & Associates, Inc. History WXKL originally signed on the air on October 2, 1952 as WEYE 1290AM with 1000 watts of power. WEYE operated with 500 watts pre-Sunrise Authority and at sunrise raised power to 1000 watts, and signed off at sunset. The station was first licensed through Waldo W. Primm—after his sale of WWGP, Sanford—and a local investment partner. The WEYE tower and studio were first located on old Spring Lane, now developed with shopping center and custom residences. (Mr. Primm resigned in mid-1950s and moved to Durham, NC, where he became chief engineer for WDNC and engineer for the Duke football network.) The origins of its early programs are unknown, until the early 1960s, when it played top 40 music. Jerry M. Farmer was one of the early station managers and morning hosts. Farmer also was news director and a top salesman of commercial advertising. In 1964, the studios of WEYE moved to the Kendale Shopping Center in Jonesboro Heights Sanford. This move enabled the general populace to look in from street level to the on-air personalities at work. In 1973, WEYE moved to 1819 Lee Avenue. As time progressed through the 1960s into the 1970s, Jerry M. Farmer left WEYE to teach Radio Television Broadcasting with Central Carolina Technical Institute in Sanford from 1970 to 1997. On December 23, 2013, Jerry Farmer died at the age of 78. He was followed at WEYE by such air personalities as: Ted Harris, Bill Medlin, Frank Parks, Danny Davis, Bruce Strickland, Mike Dennis, and Steve Stevens. WEYE aired \\"BINGO\\" in the late 1960s from 10-10:30 AM, hosted by Jerry Farmer. In the 1970s, \\"Swap Shop\\", a buy and sell program aired from 10:30-11 AM. In 1976, WEYE began to compete with cross town rival, WWGP, in the area of local news. WEYE hired Lou Merrit, a graduate of Central Carolina Technical Institute's Radio-TV Program. Lou worked local news from 1976–1978, before moving to WFJA-FM sister station of cross town rival, WWGP. Managers of WEYE were Larry Newcomb, Joe Tucker, Gary Dumars, Bob Manning, and Ken Burch. In 1979, WEYE was sold to Lamar Simmons of Lillington and the call letters were changed to WSBL, later WXKL. Simmons changed the format from top 40 to country music. In the 1960s and 1970s, WEYE carried ABC Contemporary Network News at 54:30 past the hour. Also they carried ABC Sports which allowed them to carry Howard Cosell Comments. When Simmons owned the station, he dropped ABC News and carried news from the North Carolina News Network at 55 past the hour. Simmons sold WXKL to Dr. Samuel David Ciliberto and his wife Betty in the 1980s. The format was changed to Southern Gospel Music and the studios moved to their home, vacating the 1819 Lee Avenue location. In the 1990s, Dr. Ciliberto sold the station to Rev. James Thomas. Rev. Thomas became owner of WXKL in November 1994. Rev. Thomas still operates WXKL playing primarily African American Gospel Music, both live and recorded. Today, WXKL, after a couple of studio move locations, has its studios at 1516 Woodland Avenue in Sanford, NC. Rev. James Thomas lived well into his eighth decade of life and will be remembered as a prominent African American broadcaster in not only Lee County but in the great state of North Carolina. Rev.

The primary drone (roncó) sounds a tonic note, but the other drones are sometimes simply false drones for ornamentation. The xeremia has a distinctively bright and piercing sound, which has traditionally accompanied festivals and other activities in the islands throughout history. Name The name xeremia is of French origin. The Old French word chalemie over time became charemie. This is related to the influence of Occitania during the Kingdom of Aragon, as Catalan was quite strong from the year 531 to approximately 1131, as the Occitan cultural centre expanded through the means of minstrels and bards, throughout the territory that would later be known as Catalonia. The instrument's name may be used in the singular or in the plural and has several variants, depending on the location. In Ibiza the instrument exists only without a bag, but is called also Xeremia. In the Balearic Islands it is called xeremia, xirimia, xeremies o xirimies while in Catalonia it is known as sac de gemecs. History The first reliable evidence of bagpipes in the Iberian Peninsula dates to the Middle Ages. The first written reference dates to the 9th century, in a letter from Saint Jerome to Dardanus: The influence of the court of Aragon and particularly that of Catalonia in the Balearic Islands and the cultural exchanges on both sides of the Pyrenees together with Catalan hegemony in Occitania, which had been a strong cultural center, caused an increase the number of bards and minstrels increased. In 1209 there was a massive migration of bards and minstrels fleeing Occitania, due to repression by the northern French monarchs, encouraged by Pope Innocent III. Bagpipes became prominent in those areas where the courts of Aragon and Catalonia had influence. When James I the Conqueror, conquered Majorca and Ibiza and repopulated those lands with his vassals of Catalan origin, they brought the bagpipes with them: the sac de gemecs, from which the Mallorcan xeremia (xeremia mallorquina) is derived. In the archive of the Crown of Aragon there is a document from the year 1343 that names one Joan Mascum, bagpipe minstrel to the king, from Majorca in reference to king James III. Further, it is known that the minstrels of the king of Mallorca brought to the court of Peter IV the ceremonial playing of the bagpipe through the city of Tortosa in the year 1353. There are further reports that bagpipers from a variety of nations would congregate, especially during Lent. Similar pipes are attested in Barcelona as early as 1119, and in Valencia in 1258. Reports state that a procession of Saint Dionysius contained \\"two trumpeters, two tabalers, and bagpipe.\\" After 1335, there are frequent mentions of the xeremia in records. Following this period, the pipes became even more widespread, becoming popular among shepherds and beggars, although in a primitive form. During the reign of Alfonso V of Aragon and IV of Catalonia, called The Magnanimous the instrument spread, along with other cultural trappings, to the kingdom's possessions in the Mediterranean. Reports from 1420 indicate that the court of Naples included players of the xalamies. It is in the 19th century that the instrument was modified, becoming more like the xeremia we know today. The evolution of other instruments had marginalized the bagpipes, whose range was only a single octave. As it was difficult to modernize the pipes, they remained a simple and primitive instrument. Though it faded from popularity in other Catalan territories, this was not the case of the Balearic Islands where isolation and a predominantly rural population preserved the instrument within the culture. The xeremia, close relative of the sac de gemecs, maintains its popularity in the culture of the Baleares even as native bagpiping traditions across Europe went into decline. At the end of the 20th century, several folkloric and cultural groups were working for the instrument's continued survival and expansion.* The evolution of the xeremia may be divided into two periods. Between the 12th and 16th centuries conviven instrumentos con \\"trompa\\" o sin ella. From the 16th century onwards its form resembled that of the modern variant, with the drones atop the instrument. The direct relation between this pipe and the sac de gemecs is still reflected in that the only major difference between the two pipes is that all the drones of the sac de gemecs sound, whereas two of the three xeremia drones are often dummy drones for aesthetic purposes, with only one of the three actually functional. La cobla Colla (group) formed by xeremier and flabioler. The xeremia is generally played within an ensemble known as the cobla de tres quartans, known popularly through the Ses Xeremies. In actuality, this ensemble is usually abbreviated to a mitja cobla (\\"half cobla\\") or colla consisting of only a xeremia and a flabiol (regional tabor pipe) and tambor or tamboret (drum). Coblas may take the form of: *Mitja cobla, or media cobla (\\"half cobla\\"): these are composed of one xeremia and one flabiol with tambor (drum). This form of cobla is very popular in the Balearic Islands and Catalonia. The xeremia and flabiol play the melody in unison with the flabiol accompanying himself on the drum. *Tres quartans de cobla, or tres cuartos de cobla (\\"three-quarter cobla\\"): composed of a sac de gemecs, tarota, a flabiol and a tamboret played by three musicians (as the flabiol and tamboril are played by the same musician), thus the term \\"three-quarter\\", which appears to have its origins amongst medieval minstrel groups. En el siglo XVIII las coblas de ministrils were formed with a flabiol and drum, tarota, and a xeremia, and had an important role in popular festivals. The drum established the rhythm, the bagpipe played the melody and drones, the flabiol copied the melody, and the tarota played a similar melody an octave lower than the pipes and flabiol. Repertoire Given the long history of the instrument, the repertoire of the xeremia is likewise wide, even more so in the context of the colla. There are two distinct periods of xeremia repertoire: during the first transmission of tunes was \\"closed\\", with each pair of pipers maintaining a fixed repertoire and without introducing new pieces, which also impeded other pipers from adopting their own, to the degree that pipers would refuse to play in front of other collas, in order to prevent their songs from being copied. This period caused the wide divergence of musical styles between communities of pipers. The second period is defined by the diffusion and learning of these same tunes. There are pieces documented shortly following the conquest of the island by the kingdom of Aragón such as the danzas de los cossiers de Montuïri, Algaida, Manacor and Pollença or the Cavallets danced in Felanitx, Pollença and Artà. There are also the dances of Sant Joan Pelós (or Sant Joan Pelut), the Moratons, the Indis and the Balls de Cintes, these last of which have almost disappeared. Along with these, there are other tunes such as jotas and boleros such as pasodobles, rumbas, waltzes, etc. Cultural aspects The term \\"xeremia\\" has a role in the popular speech of Majorca. Several phrases and proverbs refer to the instrument: *Content com unes xeremies - Happy as a bagpipe *Plorar com unes xeremies - To cry like a bagpipe *Dits, dits, que vent no en falta - Fingers, fingers, may you not lack for wind *Riure-se'n des Sant i ses xeremies - To laugh at the saint and the bagpipe *Més inflat que unes xeremies - More swollen than a bagpipe References  External links  * Web sobre la xeremies * La xeremia * Els Xeremiers des Puig de Sa Font * Associació Cultural Grallalsac * Tradicional Valenciana Category:Bagpipes Category:Balearic musical instruments Category:Culture of Mallorca ","title":"Xeremia"},{"id":"13695056","text":"Şeref Has (27 September 1936 – 13 June 2019) was the third most capped Turkish football player in Fenerbahçe football history with 605 appearances.

Born in Macon, Georgia; Manuel made the Parade and McDonald's All- America teams as a high school senior in 1987. The small forward/shooting guard signed with the Kentucky Wildcats, and broke into the starting lineup by the middle of his freshman year. He was named to the all-Southeastern Conference freshman team. Just before the start of his sophomore season, however, questions surfaced about his college admissions exams. Manuel had fallen short of a qualifying score on his previous attempts to take the SAT and ACT. When he took the ACT at Lafayette High School in Lexington—home to UK—he finally got a passing score. In July 1989, as part of a larger probe into the Wildcat program, the NCAA investigated Manuel's test scores after finding out he had made a dramatic nine-point improvement when he took his last ACT. When Manuel took the ACT at Lafayette High, 211 of a possible 219 answers were the same as those of another student, Chris Shearer. To the NCAA, this suggested that Manuel had cheated. Indeed, according to ACT officials, there was only a two-in-a-million chance that two students' answers could have resembled each other so closely without cheating.Wolff, Alexander. Odd Man Out. Sports Illustrated, February 11, 1991. Manuel adamantly denied any wrongdoing, but voluntarily stayed out of the lineup while the investigation progressed so as not to risk Kentucky being forced to forfeit any games if he were declared ineligible. As it turned out, the investigation dragged through the entire 1988-89 season. It was to no avail. On May 20, 1989, the NCAA placed Kentucky on three years' probation for a number of serious recruiting and academic violations. As part of the ruling, the NCAA took the unprecedented step of banning Manuel from playing another game for any NCAA member school. The NCAA found that Manuel had committed \\"academic fraud\\" by cheating on the ACT, and had also lied to the NCAA and university staff. It also forced Kentucky to vacate its two wins in that year's NCAA tournament (though it allowed Kentucky to keep all of its regular season wins), saying that UK should have known Manuel was ineligible. In a separate action, the SEC stripped Kentucky of its 1988 regular season and conference tournament titles. Raw Recruits, a book that took a critical look at the UK program, noted that there was an empty seat between all students, and that Shearer was right- handed and sitting to Manuel's left. The book's authors, Alexander Wolff and Armen Keteyian, said that Manuel would have had to look over an empty space and Shearer's right arm to copy off of him—something that would not (or should not) have gone unnoticed by Shearer, the five proctors for the test, or other students sitting near them. Shearer reportedly boasted that he'd helped Manuel get into Kentucky. Ed Dove, the public defender who represented Manuel in the NCAA case, believes that Manuel may have been tripped up by signing two answer sheets. He believes Manuel took the test honestly on one, but someone else—without Manuel's knowledge—copied Shearer's answers on the second and sent it to ACT headquarters in Iowa City. Manuel transferred to Hiwassee College in Tennessee before enrolling at NAIA power Oklahoma City University. The NAIA initially tried to ban Manuel from playing for any of its member schools as well, but ultimately an Oklahoma district court judge said that the NAIA's reasoning was meritless (he noted that numerous players who were not only cleared to play for NAIA schools but actively recruited had backgrounds that included expulsions from other schools and criminal records) and struck down their ban; an NAIA appeal was abandoned after it was clear the organization would pay a huge amount of money for legal costs and definitely lose. He helped lead Oklahoma City to consecutive NAIA National Championships in 1991 and 1992. He was picked up by the New Jersey Nets of the NBA, but couldn't make the roster. He played for a few years in Europe, then returned to Oklahoma City to work as a sales merchandiser for a Coca-Cola bottling plant. At last report, he was working for an electronics store in Oklahoma City.

This park was established by Decision 174/2001/QĐ-TTg, dated November 8, 2001, by the Prime Minister of Vietnam on upgrading Pù Mát Preservation Zone. This park is situated from N 18°46′to 19°12′and from E 104°24′to 104°56′. The park covers an area of 94,804 ha, spreading in three districts of Tương Dương, Con Cuông and Anh Sơn of Nghệ An Province. Of the total area, the strictly protected area comprises 89.517 ha, and the ecological recovery area comprises 1.596 ha. A buffer area covers 86.000 ha. Biodiversity values 2,461 plant species have been confirmed to occur at Pù Mát, some of which may be new to science; taxonomic work is currently underway to confirm this. The most widespread vegetation type in the national park is lowland evergreen forest. Pù Mát is probably one of the most important sites for mammal conservation in Vietnam.

During hot or cold weather alerts this facility is expanded to provide additional emergency shelter. An additional 110 men are housed in the Seaton House Annex through the Annex/Infirmary Harm Reduction Program.Seaton House Programs, City of Toronto website, accessed December 28, 2007 Until the 1990s, the shelter operated on a highly regimented basis imposing a series of rules and regulations including a ban on alcohol and requiring men to get out of bed by 5:15 am. A review of the shelter in the early 1990s was prompted by complaints of staff brutality and authoritarian regulations at the facility.Duffy, Andrew, \\"Seaton House divided over allegations of brutality\\", Toronto Star, November 21, 1992 Rules into the 1990s included a requirement to register for a bed by 1:30 pm. The hostel itself did not open until 4 pm and returning clients were expected to provide proof that they applied for at least three jobs during the day, the doors were locked at midnight and clients were expected to be in bed an hour earlier. Lights would go on at 5 am; breakfast was served at 5:30 am and 6:30 am and clients had to leave the premises by 7:30 am.Hall, Joseph, \\"Down and out in Metro 'When you've hit Seaton you've hit bottom,' says a regular at Seaton House\\", Toronto Star, November 3, 1990 Clients were expected to spend their days looking for work.

Previously, Seaton House banned alcohol forcing many homeless alcoholics to stay on the street using unsafe sources of liquor such as rubbing alcohol, cleaners, and industrial products. Under the new \\"managed alcohol\\" policy, alcohol-dependent clients enrolled in the program are served one five-ounce pour of wine every 90 minutes until it is determined that an individual is too inebriated, at which point he is denied another drink. The clients have been found to gradually reduce their intake under this regime and many have quit entirely.\\"'Wet' shelter needs political will: Toronto project could serve as model for Edmonton\\", Edmonton Journal, March 7, 2007Patrick, Kelly, \\"The drinks are on us at the homeless shelter: Served every 90 minutes: Managed alcohol program reduces drinking\\", National Post, January 7, 2006 The 110 beds in the annex are reserved for homeless chronic alcoholics. According to Dr. Tomislav Svoboda, a family physician attached to the program, it was opened as a result of the outcry that followed the deaths of three homeless alcoholics in the winter of 1995. Until then, welfare regulations prohibited alcoholics from receiving benefits. According to Svoboda, \\"The poor in Toronto essentially lived in prohibition. Many individuals were forced to make a decision between shelter and use of a substance.\\" A coroner's inquest into the three deaths recommended the creation of a wet shelter. After the introduction of the program, a study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in 2006 found that serving chronic street alcoholics controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption. Researchers found that program participants cut their alcohol use from an average of 48 drinks a day when they entered the program to an average of 8 drinks and that their trips to hospital emergency rooms drop to an average of eight a month from 13.5 while encounters with the police fall to an average of 8.8 from 18.1.Duffy, Andrew, \\"How some homeless alcoholics are drinking their way to good health\\" - how Ron Kirkpatrick has gained 26 pounds and stayed out of jail since joining the shelter-based program that 'manages' his consumption. The Ottawa Citizen, Canada, Wednesday, January 04, 2006 Relations with neighbourhood Seaton House is blamed by some Cabbagetown residents for contributing to the deterioration of George Street and the surrounding area. The stretch of George Street between Dundas Street and Gerrard Street where Seaton House is located has been dubbed \\"crack alley\\" by neighbours. Community members allege that Seaton House does not properly supervise its residents who, they claim, can be seen on the street outside the facility dealing and smoking crack cocaine. Toronto's director of hostel services rejects the charge of neglect saying that Seaton House and the city \\"work closely with Toronto Police Services to address the issue of drug dealers who may prey on the men that use the Seaton House program.\\"Bielski, Zosia, \\"The street Toronto abandoned; Cabbagetown address for addicts,\\" National Post, February 19, 2008 Most of the issues on George Street have nothing to do with the men who are residing at Seaton House. Redevelopment In late 2009, Toronto City Council initially approved a plan to redevelop Seaton House in partnership with Spike Capital Corp., Kearns Mancini Architects and others who own properties around the shelter, on George Street. The plan would have seen the demolition of the current facility and the transformation of the street into a mix of commercial buildings, affordable housing, student rental properties and a redesigned shelter.http://www.kelowna.com/2009/12/03/council-approves-redevelopment- partnership-that-includes-revamped- shelter/http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=172316 The demolition of Seaton House was approved by City Council in 2013, with a new plan to replace the facility with a smaller one that would provide 100 emergency shelter spaces, 378 long term care beds and 130 assisted living units along with affordable housing. The city estimates that 200 of the facility's current clients will be accommodated in the new project but 400 will require permanent relocation. As of June 2017, the closure of Seaton House has been delayed as $475 million of the redevelopment's estimated total cost of $562 million still needs to be provided and new shelter space still needs to be found for the building's 634 current occupants.https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/gta/2017/06/09/closure-of-seaton- house-shelter-delayed-as-city-struggles-to-secure-funding.html The city is now aiming to decommission the facility on May 31, 2020 and begin demolition in June. https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations- customer-service/long-term-vision-plans-and-strategies/george-street- revitalization/ References Category:Homeless shelters in Canada Category:Organizations based in Toronto Category:Organizations established in 1931 Category:Homelessness in Canada ","title":"Seaton House"},{"id":"13695199","text":"Jim Enright (born 2 November 1954) is a pornographic film director.

The film is a production of Hong Kong's Purple Light Films and People Workshop with international distribution through the Taipei-based company Arc Light Films. Drifters premiered in the 2003 Cannes Film Festival as part of the Un Certain Regard competition. Drifters follows a young slacker, Hong Yunsheng, who has become something of a local celebrity in part due to his failures as a stowaway. Recently returned to his home in Fujian after several years abroad in the U.S. as an illegal immigrant, Hong attempts to reconnect with an illegitimate son.

Attempting to find a better life in the United States, he enters the country as an undocumented worker. While there, however, his American dream quickly falls apart when he and his boss's daughter have a child. He is then told not to visit his son and is made to sign a contract saying he will not try to see him. He violates this agreement by continuing to visit his son. Enraged, Hong's boss informs the INS and has him deported back to Fujian. Back home, Hong again takes up his old habits, wandering around the town, unemployed and listless. At the same time, he attempts to find romance with a traveling opera performer, Wu Ruifang. Eventually he hears that the child he fathered in the United States is coming to Fujian. Desiring to see the child he has never known, Hong and his boss argue until eventually Hong takes desperate measures and kidnaps the boy.  Reception  Unlike Wang's previous film, Beijing Bicycle, Drifters received mixed reviews from western critics. Derek Elley of Variety claimed that the film's \\"potentially involving story is too often chopped off at the knees,\\" and also found the movie's cast to be limited by inexperience. Other critics were even harsher, finding that the film used over-direction to hide a simple and \\"syrupy\\" melodrama. Still others, however, were more positive. Bérénice Reynaud of Senses of Cinema found the film to be superior to the \\"superficial\\" Beijing Bicycle, and put Drifters in the growing category of \\"mature, disturbing, thought-provoking masterpieces inspired by globalisation.\\"  Release  Like many of Wang's films, Drifters was screened in the Un Certain Regard competition of the 2003 Cannes Film Festival on May 20.

The Wabash Bridge was a railroad bridge across the Monongahela River at Pittsburgh. It was constructed between 1902 and 1904 by railroad magnate George J. Gould for his Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway. The Wabash Bridge carried rail traffic from the elaborate Wabash Terminal in downtown Pittsburgh to the Wabash Tunnel in Mt. Washington. The rail cars were from the Wabash-Pittsburg Terminal Railroad, an ill-fated venture by George Jay Gould to compete with the Pennsylvania Railroad in Pittsburgh. After less than half a century, the Wabash was considered a “hard luck” bridge, haunted by its history, and an eyesore. In 1946, a fire destroyed the terminal. The bridge had become a useless hulk, and was dismantled two years later. Some of its steel was melted down for use in the Dravosburg Bridge, which was being built in 1948. History Construction of the bridge began in 1902. The two ends of the bridge were begun from opposite banks before being joined in the middle. On October 20th, 1903 during the efforts to merge the two ends of the bridge, the center of the bridge collapsed. The accident resulted in the deaths of 10 workers. Additional problems plagued the bridges construction site including a smallpox epidemic, bad weather, and strikes. The bridge was completed in 1904. However, the Wabash railway line was not profitable and collapsed into receivership in 1908. In 1917, the railway was absorbed into the Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway which continued running trains over the Wabash bridge. After 1931, the bridge was only used for freight traffic which ran through the downtown terminal. When the terminal and warehouses were destroyed by fire in 1946, the bridge became useless. The bridge was demolished in 1948 after years of neglect. The steel from the bridge was used in the construction of the Dravosburg Bridge in 1948. Two piers remain in place today, the only remnants of the bridge still in place at the original site. The Wabash Tunnel, which carried the railroad through the hills south of the Monongahela River, sat abandoned for more than 50 years before reopening to one-way auto traffic in 2004.

Viel joined the Sisters of the Christian Schools in 1833 with the order's founder and mother general Saint Marie-Madeleine Postel being her aunt and served alongside her in various capacities. Viel made extensive travels setting up branches of the order and made several trips to Paris to collect funds for the order's expansion while later travelling across Europe as her aunt's successor for the order's continued growth. Her beatification was celebrated in 1951. Life Eulalie Victoire Jacqueline Viel was born in France on 26 September 1815 as one of eight children to farmers (she was baptized just moments after her birth with her godparents being Jeanne Viel and Jacques Tournaille). Her aunt was Saint Marie-Madeleine Postel. One sister was Victoire who died in her childhood. Viel was known for being timid but also pleasant and cheerful; she made her First Communion before the mandated age because the parish priest of Quettehou believed she was mature enough. Her parents sent her to learn sewing when she was old enough from the village seamstress Madame Gilles and she taught catechism and the psalms to the local children. Her heart was set on the religious life and she joined her aunt in her new religious congregation on 1 May 1835 while being given the new religious name \\"Placide\\" and served at some stage as the novice mistress after having first worked in the kitchens. Her solemn profession of perpetual vows was made on 21 September 1838. Viel studied at Argentan as she entered the order and worked in school administration while founding new convents at her aunt's request. Her aunt also instructed her to go to Paris to collect funds so the order could continue to grow and function. Viel made three such visits with the first being from January to June 1844. The second was from October 1844 to 1845 and the last visit before her appointment as superior-general was from October 1845 to June 1846 when she had to return to see her ailing aunt. It was on one of those visits that she met with Queen Marie-Amelie. In the late spring of 1845 she toured Rennes and Nantes before moving on to Saint- Brieuc. On 1 January 1842 she was appointed as assistant-general of the sisters in an appointment that caused great resentment among her sisters since some believed it granted her too much power. After her aunt died in 1846 she became the mother-general of the order at the age of 31 on 5 September (two months after her aunt's death) in what was a unanimous election. But she wanted to be able to continue going to Paris to collect funds rather than be elected though still rising to the position. Viel directed the institute for three decades and received papal approval for the order in 1859 from Pope Pius IX. Her tenure as superior-general saw membership in the order increase from 150 to more than 1000 as well as seeing an increase in the number of convents. The superior-general was noted for her charm as well as for her humble and retiring disposition. On 14 September 1849 she arrived in Vienna where she met with its archbishop before setting off for Brussels. Viel made successive visits after Brussels to Cologne and Berlin as well as Breslau. Viel met with Count Henri on 19 September at the Frohsdorf castle and later met with Frederick William at Potsdam en route back home. Viel died at Saint-Sauveur- le-Vicomte on 4 March 1877 after having been organizing relief during the Franco-Prussian War that had broken out around that time. Beatification Her cause for canonization was introduced on 22 July 1935 titling her as a Servant of God while confirmation of her heroic virtue allowed for her to be named as Venerable on 9 February 1941. Pope Pius XII beatified her on 6 May 1951.

The name, applied by other groups, derives from the word ar-rumah () \\"fusiliers\\".N.

The Arma ethnicity is distinct from (but sometimes confused with) the 3.6 million Zarma people of western Niger, who predate the Moroccan invasion and speak the Zarma language, also a member of the Songhay languages. The Songhai expedition and aftermath The 1590 expedition sent to conquer the Songhai Empire trade routes by the Saadi dynasty of Morocco was made up of four thousand Moroccan, Morisco refugees and European renegades, armed with European-style arquebuses. After the destruction of the Songhai Empire in 1591, the Moroccans settled into Djenné, Gao, Timbuktu and the larger towns of the Niger River bend. Never able to exert control outside their large fortifications, within a decade the expedition's leaders were abandoned by Morocco. In cities like Timbuktu, the men of the 1591 expedition intermarried with the Songhai, became small scale independent rulers, and some of their descendants came to be identified as minor dynasties of their own right. By the end of the 17th century, Bambara, Tuareg, Fula and other forces came to control empires and city-states in the region, leaving the Arma as a mere ethnicity.

Known as \\"The Wizard of the North,\\" he was a brother to the successful jockey Bill Scott.Vamplew and Kay \\"Scott brothers\\" Encyclopedia of British Horseracing pp. 278-279 Early life John Scott and Bill were the sons of a former jockey who became a trainer. John was born on 8 November 1794 at Chippenham, Cambridgeshire. Although John also was a jockey while young and won his first race as a jockey at age 13, as he became older he gained too much weight to continue to ride and became a trainer instead. The brothers began their careers under their father, who managed an inn at Oxford - The Ship Inn.Vamplew \\"Scott, John (1794–1871)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography By 1814 were employed by James Croft of Middleham. In 1815 was involved in victory of Filho da Puta in the St. Leger Stakes. Scott then trained for a Mr Houldsworth for 8 years before moving on to train for Edward Petre of Stapleton Park near Darrington. In 1825 Scott bought Whitewall Stables in Malton, where he was able to stable 100 horses. This remained his home until his death. For many years Scott moved his operation in the summer months from Whitewall to a small race course outside Doncaster called Pigburn. This was because his local training ground became too hard for the horses to gallop during dry spells. In 1851 he constructed a \\"tan gallop\\" on Langton Wold, local to his Malton stables, where he could exercise his horses in dry weather conditions without the need to move them each year to Pigburn. Career Scott won his first St. Leger in 1822 with Theodore while training for Petre. This was the first of 16 St Leger wins, 9 Oaks wins, and 6 Epsom Derby wins. 6 of his St Leger wins were with his brother Bill as jockey. But in 1844 the brothers parted company and Frank Butler became the main jockey for John Scott, going on to win 10 Classic wins for Scott. During his career, John Scott trained for notable owners such as Edward Smith-Stanley the Earl of Derby, Evelyn Boscawen Viscount Falmouth, and John Bowes. Scott disparaged The Baron to the horse's owner George Watts by describing the stallion as \\"fat as a bull\\" as well as having been \\"made twice the savage he was by muzzles\\" but still asked to have the horse put in training with himself, promising Watts that he would win the St Leger. Watts agreed to send The Baron to Whitehall, and Scott trained the horse to a win in the race. But Scott maintained that The Baron \\"took more work than I ever gave a horse in my life, and required more management\\".Willet Classic Racehorse p. 89 During his training career, John Scott won 41 British Classic Races and in 1853 became the first trainer to win the English Triple Crown when the John Bowes owned colt, West Australian, won the 2,000 Guineas, The Derby, and the St. Leger Stakes. In his old age, Scott was noted for his long white hair. He was also known to entertain guests at home by carving meat with a knife whose handle was the shank bone of Rowton, who was the third horse he trained to a St. Leger win. Death John Scott died on 4 October 1871 at Whitehall House after catching a chill in August while observing morning workouts. He was buried on 9 October 1871 at Malton. He married twice. He had two children, a daughter with his first wife and a son with his second wife. A miniature watercolour portrait titled \\"John Scott of Whitewall Malton\\" from the English School (19th century) is on display at the Bowes Museum. After his death, the Whitewall Stables remained empty until his wife died in 1891. Following her death the stables were purchased by jockey Thomas Bruckshaw and today they are operated by trainer Mark Campion. Travel distance Before the advent of rail links and motorised transport, race horses were moved to and from events by being walked. The distance from Scott's Whitewall stables to the Doncaster Racecourse, where his horses won 16 St. Leger Stakes, is about 60 miles. The distance from his stables to Newmarket where the 2000 and 1000 Guineas are held is about 190 miles and from the stables to Epsom (Derby and Oaks) is 250 miles. Some idea of the logistics involved comes from a news item in the Yorkshire Gazette, February 14, 1835: :::: \\"On Tuesday last, the following horses, from Mr.John Scott’s stables, Whitewall Corner, near Malton, passed through this city [York], on their way to the south. Many persons mustered to see them, who appeared to be highly delighted with the opportunity of beholding such a numerous train of choice racers. :::::* Lord Chesterfield’s ch. g.

By 1839 the railway had reached York (less than 20 miles from the Whitewall stables) with a direct link to London. The Yorkshire Gazette in April 1844 reported that John Scott was moving his horses by rail, however, at this time there was no direct link to either Epsom or Newmarket - the line to Epsom opened in 1847 and the Newmarket line some years later. When Scott took his horses to Epsom they were stabled at Leatherhead where there was a prepared gallop for their use.

It adopted professionalism in 1885, and three years later, as Small Heath F.C., became a limited company with a board of directors, the first football club so to do. The team played in the Football Alliance from the 1889–90 season, and in 1892, along with the other Alliance teams, were invited to join the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. Although they finished as champions, they failed to win promotion via the test match system; the following season promotion to the First Division was secured after a second-place finish and test match victory over Darwen. The club adopted the name Birmingham Football Club in 1905, and the following year moved into a new home, St Andrew's Ground. Matters on the field failed to live up to their surroundings. Birmingham were relegated in 1908, obliged to apply for re-election two years later, and remained in the Second Division until after the First World War. Under the captaincy of Frank Womack, who went on to set club appearance records, Birmingham won their second Division Two title in 1920–21. The 19-year-old Joe Bradford made his debut in 1920; he was to score a club record 267 goals in 445 games and win 12 caps for England. In 1931, manager Leslie Knighton led the club to their first FA Cup Final; they lost 2–1 to Second Division club West Bromwich Albion. Though Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons, they struggled in the league, placing too much reliance on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs to make up for the lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end. They were finally relegated in 1938–39, the last full season before the Football League was suspended for the duration of the Second World War. The name Birmingham City F.C. was adopted in 1943. Under Harry Storer, appointed manager in 1945, the team won the Football League South wartime league and reached the semi- final of the first post-war FA Cup. Two years later they won their third Second Division title, conceding only 24 goals in the 42-game season. Storer's successor, Bob Brocklebank, though unable to stave off relegation in 1950, brought in players who made a major contribution to the club's successes of the next decade. After taking over halfway through the 1954–55 season, Arthur Turner led the team to another Second Division title followed by what remains their highest league finish, of sixth place in the First Division, in 1955–56. They also reached the FA Cup final, losing 3–1 to Manchester City in the game best remembered for City's goalkeeper Bert Trautmann playing the last 20 minutes with a broken bone in his neck. The following season the club lost in the FA Cup semi-final for the third time since the war, this time beaten 2–0 by Manchester United's \\"Busby Babes\\". Birmingham became the first English club side to take part in European competition when they played their first fixture in the inaugural Inter-Cities Fairs Cup competition in May 1956; they lost to Barcelona after a replay in the semi-final. They were also the first to reach a European final, losing to Barcelona in the 1960 Fairs Cup final, and also lost to Roma in 1961. As a player, Gil Merrick had beaten Womack's appearance record and been England's regular goalkeeper; as manager, his team saved their best form for cup competitions. Opponents in the 1963 League Cup final, local rivals Aston Villa, were pre-match favourites, but Birmingham raised their game and won 3–1 on aggregate to lift their first major trophy. By 1965, Merrick had been asked to resign, and after ten years in the top flight, Birmingham were back in the Second Division.  1875–92: The early years  In 1875, when members of the cricket team based at Holy Trinity Church, Bordesley, on the east side of Birmingham, decided they wanted something to do in the winter months, they formed a football team. Playing under the name of Small Heath Alliance, their early games took place on a piece of waste ground off Arthur Street. As interest grew, they moved to an enclosed field in the Sparkbrook area where admission could be charged. In 1877, they decamped again, this time paying £5 a year to the family of a team member to rent a field adjacent to Muntz Street, in the Small Heath district, which became their home for the next 29 years.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. p. 8.Muntz Street and surroundings in 1890 For the first thirteen years of their existence, there was no league football, so friendly matches were arranged on an ad hoc basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at local and national level. During the 1880s, they played between 20 and 30 matches each season.Matthews. Encyclopedia. p. 8. They played Aston Villa, the team that would become their main local rivals, for the first time in 1879; Small Heath won by \\"a goal and a disputed goal to nil\\". They first entered the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1878–79,Matthews (2010). Complete Record. p. 504. made their debut in the national cup competition, the FA Cup, in 1881–82 – Billy Slater scored their first goal in nationally organised football as Small Heath beat Derby Town 4–1Matthews (2010). Complete Record. p. 466. – and won their first trophy, the Walsall Cup, the following season. In 1885–86, Small Heath reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, in which they faced West Bromwich Albion in front of 10,000 spectators at Aston Lower Grounds. According to the Sheffield & Rotherham Independent, Small Heath, who were by no means one of the foremost teams in the Birmingham area, had had a fortunate draw in the competition, whereas their opponents, fellow members of the Birmingham Football Association, were among the strongest in the country. Albion won easily, by four goals to nil, and the game was ended early after the losing supporters invaded the pitch and pelted the Albion goalkeeper with snowballs. As soon as payment of players over and above their actual out-of-pocket expenses was permitted by the Football Association for the first time, in 1885, the Small Heath club turned professional. The players did not receive a salary, but instead shared half the gate money. Three years later, at the suggestion of Walter Hart, the president of the Birmingham FA who had once been the club's honorary secretary, it became the first football club to structure itself as a limited company with a board of directors,Inglis. League Football. pp. 390–91. under the name of The Small Heath Football Club Limited. The original company listed its objects as \\"to acquire a Football Club to play the game of Association Football and the doing all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above\\", set its nominal capital at £500, to be divided into ten-shilling shares, and its memorandum of association listed seven initial subscribers who between them took up 35 of the 1000 shares. These included Hart, who became the first chairman of its board, Alfred Jones, honorary secretary, and William Starling. alt=Head and upper torso of a young dark-haired white man with thick eyebrows and a large moustache.

Instead, they joined the Football Combination, a second league formed to provide organised football for such excluded clubs. This was not a success; poor organisation caused it to fold in April 1889 with many fixtures still outstanding.Inglis. League Football. p. 12. For 1889–90, Small Heath were accepted into the Football Alliance, a new second league whose committee adopted the more successful aspects of the Football League's organisation, including limiting team numbers to a manageable twelve, and arranging and publishing the fixture list before the season began. After two tenth-place finishes, and elimination from the 1890–91 FA Cup for fielding an ineligible player, they finished third in 1891–92, helped by Fred Wheldon's 21 goals from the 22 matchesMatthews (2010).

Jenkyns became the first man to play a senior international match while a Small Heath player when selected for Wales for the 1892–93 Home Internationals.Matthews. Encyclopedia. pp. 121–22. They also progressed through four qualifying rounds and one round proper to reach the last 16 of the FA Cup. Drawn first, and therefore having choice of venue, Small Heath accepted Sheffield Wednesday's offer of £200 to forfeit home advantage and play the match at Wednesday's Olive Grove ground; they lost.  1892–1905: Small Heath in the Football League  The Football League decided to expand its membership for the 1892–93 season by forming a Second Division. Although Small Heath's application for admission to the enlarged First Division failed, they were one of eight Football Alliance teams accepted into the Second. The directors appointed Alfred Jones as the club's first paid secretary, and William Starling was elected to the Football League Management Committee as one of two representatives of the Second Division.Inglis. League Football. p. 387. During the season, the team scored 90 goals at an average of 4 goals per game, beat Walsall Town Swifts 12–0 to set a club record League victory which, , still stands, remained undefeated on their own ground, and won the last nine matches of the season to take the inaugural Second Division title. Goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a policeman who played as an amateur and went on to serve as chief constable of Coventry, became the first Small Heath player to be capped by England. Promotion to the First Division was not automatic, even for the champions, but depended on the results of test matches between the top three Second Division and bottom three First Division teams. Small Heath lost to 16th-placed First Division team Newton Heath (the future Manchester United) after a replay, so were not promoted, although the teams placed second and third were.Inglis. League Football. p. 30. Their success at the second attempt, as 1893–94 runners-up and victors over Darwen in the test match, was met with relief as well as celebration. The club had been in serious financial difficulty during the season, during which it added a loss of £222 to an existing deficit of some £350; the Birmingham Daily Post believed that \\"defeat would in all probability have meant the disbanding of the club\\", ambitions of promotion having sustained the committee's efforts throughout the season to raise enough funds to keep going. Coventry Road groundalt=View towards one end of the ground, showing a roof, supported by several pillars and bearing a clock, covering the central part (behind the goal) of an otherwise open terrace Ahead of their first season in the top division, and in anticipation of increased attendances, the club began work on a grandstand and relaid the pitch. Over the next few years, they purchased the remaining eleven years of the lease on the Coventry Road ground, and bought the grandstand from Aston Villa's Wellington Road ground to use as a terrace cover, providing more covered standing accommodation. Despite the misgivings of the Daily Post that the squad was too small, the team finished 12th of 16. They opened the 1895–96 campaign with six defeats, spent most of it in the bottom two places, conceded more goals than any other team in the division for the second consecutive season, and scored fewer than all but bottom club West Bromwich Albion. The directors were criticised for failing to improve the team and for their selection policy: making too many changes to the team from one game to the next, and playing men when they were unfit.\\"Serious outlook for Midland clubs\\". The Sportsman, quoted in A draw from the final match of the season, at home to Sunderland, would have secured their First Division status for another year, but they lost, finished 15th of the 16 teams, and were relegated. Following the relegation, Fred Wheldon, who had scored 116 goals from 175 matches in league and FA Cup,Matthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 224–37. left for League champions Aston Villa for a fee of £350, which was reported to be a national record. Small Heath were involved in two incidents during First Division matches that had lasting ramifications. After one of Everton's goals in a 4–4 draw in November 1894 was awarded despite having gone well wide, the referee believing it had passed through a hole in the netWilliam McGregor, former president of the League, suggested that it was the worst decision he had seen since goal-nets were introduced, and the scorer agreed that it was no goalthe League issued an instruction to referees to examine the nets before each match in the future. A year later, after their visit to Everton was abandoned after 37 minutes because of bad weather and the state of the pitch, a spectator took the host club to court claiming the return of his admission money. The case was decided in favour of the club, the judge ruling that the paying spectator is not entitled to a full 90 minutes' football, but only to that portion which can reasonably be completed within the rules of the game. alt=Head and shoulders of a young clean-shaven white man with neatly trimmed hair. He is looking straight ahead, and is wearing a shirt wth a drawstring at the neck.Five seasons in the Second Division followed. Small Heath started 1896–97 badly but finished frustratingly well, in fourth position. After coming sixth in 1898, they were only two points off the promotion positions with four matches of the 1898–99 season to play; they lost three, drew one, and finished eighth. Walter Abbott set club records that still stand, of 34 league goals in a season and 42 in all competitions. In 1899–1900, Small Heath were never out of the top four in the division but rarely in the top two, and finished third. Both income and expenditure had doubled over the two First Division seasons. The local press criticised the \\"penny wise and pound foolish\\" approach to the signing of players after relegation, and the 1898–99 accounts illustrated an over-reliance on gate receipts: Woolwich Arsenal took £360 less on the gate, but their profit exceeded Small Heath's by nearly £3,000. After an £875 loss the following season, the directors made it clear they could not continue funding a loss-making enterprise, and suggested that a reduction in players' wages was the only course of action. Two defeats at the end of the 1900–01 season deprived Small Heath of a second divisional title, but not of promotion as runners-up. They also reached the quarter-final of the FA Cup, losing to Aston Villa after a replay. The board's decision to reject Villa's offer of \\"a big transfer fee and a benefit match in addition\\" for the services of centre-forward Bob McRoberts was vindicated when he top-scored with 17 goals.Matthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 246–47. Average attendances rose from 5,500 to 13,000 for 1901–02,Matthews. Encyclopedia. pp. 20–21. but finishing the season with a six-match unbeaten run was not enough to escape relegation. A fifth change of division in eleven seasons – they reached the top two places by mid-November 1902 and remained there for the rest of the campaign – gained Small Heath the reputation of a yo-yo club.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. p. 12. This time, a late run proved enough to keep them in the division, in contrast to 1904–05 when they reached second place in mid-February, one point behind Everton, but lost six of the last ten games to finish seventh.  1905–15: New name and new home  With William Adams as president and former player Harry Morris on the board, the club adopted a more enterprising approach. An extraordinary general meeting in March 1905 heard a proposal that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club. That name was approved by the Football Association, after consulting the Birmingham F.A., and by the League, and was formally adopted ahead of the 1905–06 season. It was still a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \\"the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\\", and the Manchester Courier reported their assuming \\"the more pretentious name of Birmingham\\". The inadequacies of the Coventry Road ground, which was by then surrounded by tightly-packed housing, were highlighted by events surrounding the February 1905 match with Aston Villa. The official attendance was given as 28,000, though with the gates closed before kick-off, thousands scaled walls or forced entrances in order to gain admission, and the actual attendance was estimated at anything up to 35,000.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. pp. 57–59. The Birmingham Daily Mail commented that had space been available, another ten or fifteen thousand spectators might well have attended, as \\"hundreds of people found the doors closed against them, and probably there were thousands who would not go to the ground in view of the inevitable crush.\\" The landlords had raised the rent, but would neither sell the freehold of the ground nor allow its expansion, and the directors estimated that remaining at Coventry Road was losing the club as much as £2,000 a year in revenue. Morris identified the site of a disused brickworks, three-quarters of nearer the city centre, as suitable for a new ground, the directors signed a 21-year lease, and construction began in January 1906. On 26 December of that year, after volunteers spent all morning clearing the snow, 32,000 spectators witnessed the official opening of the 75,000-capacity St Andrew's Ground and a goalless draw with Middlesbrough. The Football Association used the ground for a semi- final of that season's FA Cup,Matthews. Encyclopedia. pp. 193–96. but Birmingham's play failed to live up to the new surroundings. They were relegated in 1907–08, prompting the resignation of Alf Jones, who had been secretary-manager since 1892. Successor Alex Watson's two seasons in charge ended with Birmingham bottom of the Second Division and having to apply for re-election to the league. After Hart's address, in which he stressed the club's age and longstanding league membership and assured his audience that inexperienced directors to whom the team's present position could be attributed had retired in favour of men of experience, the meeting voted Birmingham back into the league as top of the poll. Responsibility for team affairs passed to former player Bob McRoberts, who became the club's first dedicated team manager.Matthews. Encyclopedia. pp. 145–46. Birmingham remained in the second tier for the five seasons before League football was suspended because of the First World War.  1915–39: Birmingham in the First Division  Frank Richards had taken over as secretary in 1911, and also acted as Birmingham's team manager for the various wartime competitions. When the Football League resumed after the war, he retained the post, and it was under his management that they returned to the First Division, in which they would remain for eighteen seasons. Birmingham placed third in 1919–20, and in 1920–21, driven by Frank Womack's captaincy and the creative skills of Scottish international Johnny Crosbie,Matthews (1995). Complete Record. p. 14. they reached the last day of the 1920–21 season needing to beat Port Vale away to be sure of maintaining their position ahead of Cardiff City and thus clinch the division title for the second time. They did so. A 19-year-old called Joe Bradford scored on his competitive debut on Christmas Day 1920 at West Ham United; he went on to set goalscoring records for the club of 267 goals, 249 in the league, was their leading scorer for twelve consecutive seasons from 1922 to 1933, and scored seven times in twelve appearances for England.Matthews. Encyclopedia. p. 74. Off the field, the club bought the freehold of St Andrew's in 1921 for around £7,000.Matthews. Encyclopedia. p. 87. Birmingham finished 18th out of 22 in the first season back at the top level, but did not take part in the 1921–22 FA Cup. The club failed to submit the entry form in time to be granted exemption from qualifying, and the Football Association refused to bend the rules in their favour. Although that decision did not preclude their entering the competition in the qualifying rounds, the directors chose not to do so.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. p. 164. In 1922–23, the team set an unwanted record sequence of eight league defeats, since equalled but not beaten. Off the field, the club made a £13,000 saving on wages and general expenses to end the season with a profit of £3,000. This had been Richards' last season as secretary-manager. He was succeeded by Billy Beer, who had played 250 matches for the club in the 1900s. He led the team to three mid-table finishes before, in early 1927, a boardroom dispute over transfer policy came to a head. Writing in the Sports Argus, the pseudonymous \\"Argus Junior\\" described one faction as \\"anxious to secure talent at almost any price\\" and the other \\"desirous with 'going slow' as its motto\\", and believed that \\"the former are now in the ascendancy and that they mean business\\". Three directors resigned, followed a few days later by Beer, who had reportedly found it impossible to work with some members of the board. Over the next few months, further departures included secretary Sam Richards, former player Billy Harvey, who had acted as team manager, and the long- serving Womack, who made his Birmingham debut in 1908 and set club appearance records of 491 league games, a record which still stands, and 515 games in senior competition, since overtaken by Gil Merrick. The Argus suggested a better course of action and \\"the clear duty of the present board [would be] to resign and test the feelings of the shareholders\\". Instead, it appointed former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton as secretary-manager in June 1928. He was able to stabilise the team and in 1930–31, led them to their first FA Cup Final. Between semi-final and final Birmingham lost six of their nine league matches, and The Times reminded its readers that \\"sickness and injury had played havoc with their men for weeks past. They had no regular practice together for the great match.\\" Opponents West Bromwich Albion were heading for promotion from the Second Division, youthful and full of confidence. Bradford had played only once since the semi-final and declared himself fit on the morning of the match.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. pp. 18, 173. Birmingham had a goal disallowed early on, then fell behind; the clearly unfit Bradford was able to equalise, but W. G. Richardson went upfield straight from the kickoff and scored his side's winner. Knighton's team finished in the top half of the division in 1932, and he signed a contract extension, but when Chelsea made him an offer he could not refuse, he left, to be replaced by George Liddell, recently retired from playing.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. pp. 19–20. Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons in all, but most of them were spent in the bottom half of the table. Consistency of selection played a part in the 1920s; six – Womack, Bradford, Crosbie, Dan Tremelling, Percy Barton and Liddell – of the fifteen men with more than 300 league appearances for the club played most of their matches in that decade.Matthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 471–72. Much reliance was placed on Tremelling and then on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs to make up for the lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 15–17. Under Liddell's management, the makeup of the side never settled. He used 70 players over his six seasons in charge (in contrast to the 55 used in the first six First Division seasons in the 1920sMatthews (2010). Complete Record. pp. 284–95.), and after narrowly avoiding relegation three times in 1934, 1935 and 1938, Birmingham were finally relegated in 1938–39, the last full season before the Second World War. The club's record attendance of 67,341 was set that season, in the fifth round of the FA Cup against Everton.  1939–65: Birmingham City and post-war success  When war was declared in September 1939, the government banned public gatherings until safety implications could be assessed. Most football grounds reopened soon afterwards, even those in built-up or strategically significant areas, but Birmingham's Chief Constable ordered the continued closure of St Andrew's because of its proximity to likely air-raid targets such as the BSA munitions factories.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. pp. 21–22. The matter was raised in Parliament, but the Home Secretary felt unable to intervene in what was perceived as a local issue, and the Chief Constable did not bow to public pressure until March 1940. The ground suffered 20 direct hits from Luftwaffe bombing, bringing down the roof of the Kop terrace, and fires damaged the railway end stand, scoreboard and clock, and destroyed the main stand, including board room, gymnasium, treatment room and offices. The club's current name of Birmingham City F.C. was adopted in 1943.Matthews. Encyclopedia. p. 55. \\"City was added to Birmingham (to make Birmingham City Football Club) in the summer of 1943 (and not 1945 as previously thought). The official Blues home programmes for the 1943–44 season clearly show Birmingham City Football Club on the front cover.\\" When nationally organised football resumed in 1945, Harry Storer was appointed manager. In his first season the club won the Football League South title, ahead of Aston Villa on goal average – the 1945–46 Football League North and South included teams from the pre-war First and Second Divisions, and were an interim step between the highly regionalised and mixed-ability wartime leagues and the Football League itself, which restarted in 1946–47 – and reached the semi-final of the first post-war FA Cup. Two years later they won their third Second Division title, conceding only 24 goals in the 42-game season.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. pp. 22-23. Bob Brocklebank succeeded Storer as manager in 1950. Though unable to prevent them being relegated, he and chief scout Walter Taylor laid the foundations for the club's successes of the 1950s. Brocklebank was responsible for introducing future England internationals Trevor Smith and Jeff Hall to the side, and for bringing in several mainstays of Birmingham's teams through the 1950s.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 61. Arthur Turner took over as manager in November 1954 with the club mid-table in the Second Division. By the end of the season they had scored 92 goals, with all five first-choice forwards reaching double figures,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 25–27. beaten Liverpool 9–1, a result which remains that club's record defeat, and were confirmed champions with a 5–1 win in the last game of the season away to Doncaster Rovers. Birmingham's sixth position in their first season back in the First Division remains their highest league finish. They also reached their second FA Cup Final, but lost 3–1 to Manchester City in a game best remembered for City's goalkeeper, Bert Trautmann, playing the last 20 minutes with a broken bone in his neck. City won using the Revie Plan, in which their centre-forward Don Revie played in a deep position, disrupting the Birmingham defence accustomed to the era's conventional playing positions. Goalkeeper Gil Merrick attributed to the defeat to a half-time failure to discuss how to stop Revie, and outside left Alex Govan blamed the absence of the \\"utterly ruthless\\" Roy Warhurst through injury and a poor choice of replacement. Lewis (ed.) Keeping Right On. p. 63. \\"... if Badham had been in we would have won that game. He would never have given Don Revie the room to run the match.\\" It was during this FA Cup campaign, in which all Birmingham's games had been away from home, that Harry Lauder's \\"Keep right on to the end of the road\\" was adopted as the fans' anthem. The following season the club lost in the FA Cup semi-final for the third time since the war, beaten 2–0 by Manchester United's \\"Busby Babes\\". For the inaugural edition of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a football tournament set up in 1955 to promote international trade fairs, invitations were extended to host cities rather than to clubs. Aston Villa rejected the opportunity to supply players for a combined team to represent the city of Birmingham, so Birmingham City became the first English club side to play in European competition when they played their first match on 15 May 1956. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, the 1960 Fairs Cup Final, in which they lost to Barcelona 4–1 on aggregate. They reached and lost in the 1961 final as well, to Roma 4–2 on aggregate. In February 1958, three days after Birmingham lost 8–0 at Preston North End, former Bristol City manager Pat Beasley joined the club. He was expected to be Turner's assistant, but chairman Harry Morris Jr. announced his appointment as joint manager, that Turner had recommended him, and that secretary Walter Adams was also to have input into team matters. At the time, Turner was quoted as being happy with the arrangement, but was later reported to have only found out about it from the press and to have needed persuading not to resign.Matthews (1995). Complete Record. p. 62. The experiment did not work. Turner and the board found themselves at odds over aspects of managerial policy, the players unsure as to who was in charge. With the team lying 21st after a 6–0 defeat against West Bromwich Albion, Turner quit in September 1958. Beasley was named acting manager, and would have to submit his team selections to the board for discussion, though not for alteration: Morris insisted that \\"The manager and not the directors will pick the team as long as I am chairman.\\" He led the team to a 9th-place finish. Towards the end of the season, two weeks after playing in a match at Portsmouth, Birmingham full-back Jeff Hall died of polio. The realisation that a young, fit, England footballer could die of a preventable disease sparked a massive rise in demand for vaccination, and a memorial fund launched in his name by the club and local newspapers endowed a research fellowship in the University of Birmingham's Department of Medicine. Gil Merrick joined the club in 1939 and kept goal during and after the war through the 1940s and much of the 1950s. He won 23 caps for England, and set a club record of 551 appearances in all senior competitions, as well as coaching the reserves. After Birmingham finished 19th in 1959–60, having been in or just above the relegation places throughout the season, Merrick was appointed first-team manager. He was unable to improve the team's league performance, but did lead them to the first major trophy in the club's history. Entry to the new League Cup competition, introduced in 1960–61, was optional; several top-flight clubs chose not to enter, but Birmingham did so from the first year.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 29–31. In 1962–63, while avoiding relegation only by winning two of their last three matches, they showed their best form in reaching the League Cup final, which was played over two legs on the grounds of the competing clubs. Opponents Aston Villa were pre-match favourites, having beaten Birmingham 4–0 in their most recent league meeting. But in the home leg Birmingham \\"served up a treat of attacking football ... controlling the game with such assurance that their supporters must have wondered why the team had performed so badly in the First Division\\", and came out comfortable 3–1 winners, with two goals from Ken Leek and one from Jimmy Bloomfield. Under the captaincy of Trevor Smith, a solid defensive performance in a goalless draw saw Birmingham lift the trophy at the home of their local rivals. After the fourth consecutive bottom-six finish – they won the last two matches of 1963–64 to escape relegation – the board felt a \\"complete reorganisation\\" of the club was necessary, and asked Merrick to resign. He complied, but thought he had been ill-treated, and had nothing more to do with the club for more than thirty years. In 1964-65, Birmingham finished seven points away from safety and returned to the Second Division.

One of the seven cursed children of Tau and Kerana, Jasy Jatere is one of the most important gods among the Guaraní speaking cultures of South America, especially in Paraguay. Depiction of young Jasy Jatere  Mythology  = Description = Jasy Jatere, which means literally \\"a little piece of the moon\\", is unique among his brothers in that he does not have a monstrous appearance. He is usually described as being a small man or perhaps a child, with light blonde hair and sometimes blue eyes. He is fair in appearance, sometimes described as even beautiful or enchanting, and carries with him a magical wand or staff, sometimes described as a golden cane, although what clothing he wears, if any at all, does not seem to be an important part of the legend. Like most of his brothers he dwells in the wild, he is considered to be the protector of the yerba mate plant. Sometimes he is also viewed as a protector of hidden treasures. In Guaraní (Latin American) mythology, Jasy Jatere is protector of the yerba mate plant. He is also lord of the siesta. = Relations with children = Jasy Jatere is also considered to be the lord of the siesta, the traditional mid-day nap taken in many Latin American cultures. According to one widespread version of the myth, Jasy Jatere leaves the forest and wanders the villages looking for children who are not napping during their siesta. Although he is generally invisible, it is said that he shows himself to the children he finds not napping, and that any who look upon his staff fall into a trance. He may even lure them into the forest with a distinct whistle. What happens to such entranced children differs depending upon which version of the story is told. Many Guaraní myths have multiple versions because there existed no written version of the language, and all myths have survived as word of mouth tales only. In the fairer version of the tale, Jasy Jatere is considered a friend of such disobedient children, taking them into hidden places in the forest to play and feeding them with honey and fruit. At the end of the siesta, when all are weary from the play, Jasy Jatere gives them a magical kiss which transports them back to their beds with no memory of the experience. Most versions of the story are less fair. Commonly, Jasy Jatere takes entranced children back to a cave where he puts out their eyes and imprisons them for an untold amount of time, sustaining them with wild fruits and berries until they become feral like animals. Still more gruesome tales say that the children are brought back to his brother Ao Ao, a cannibalistic creature who feeds upon their flesh. These versions of the myth are told in a similar vein to the Bogeyman, designed to frighten children into being obedient and taking a nap during their siesta. Paraguayan parents are known to warn their children not to wander off alone during siesta to prevent being kidnapped by Jasy Jatere. It is said that Jasy Jatere's power stems from the magical staff that he carries, and if one is able to take it from him, he breaks down and cries like a little child.

She was described by Breeders' Cup Inc. as \\"one of the greatest 2-year-old fillies ever\\". Foaled in Florida, Meadow Star was bred by Jaime Carrion at his The Oaks farm in Ocala. Sired by the American Grade I winner Meadowlake, and out of the mare Inreality Star, she was sold at the 1989 Keeneland yearling sale for $90,000. Her buyer, prominent Wall Street investor Carl Icahn, handed her over to trainer LeRoy Jolley for race conditioning. Racing career =1990: Two-year-old season= Meadow Star made a successful racing debut on June 13, 1990, winning an allowance race at New York's Belmont Park. She went on to win four straight graded stakes races. In her last outing before the Breeders' Cup, she won the Frizette Stakes by fourteen lengths. Shortly thereafter, Icahn announced that he would donate all of Meadow Star's future earnings to the Children's Rescue Fund, a charity he had founded to help homeless children. Ridden by José A. Santos, Meadow Star was the overwhelming betting favorite for the 1990 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. Bet down to 1:5 odds, she was the heaviest favorite in the history of the Breeders Cup races. Lite Light, owned by Rap music star MC Hammer, was a distant second choice at 9:1. Meadow Star did not disappoint her supporters, winning by five lengths over runner-up Private Treasure. She defeated the future Hall of Fame filly Dance Smartly, who finished third, as well as future two-time American Champion Female Turf Horse and Hall of Fame inductee Flawlessly. Meadow Star's undefeated 1990 season made her the unanimous winner of the Eclipse Award for American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. =1991: Three- year-old season= As a three-year-old, Meadow Star won her first two races of 1991. Then, up against males for the first time, she finished a well-beaten fourth in the Wood Memorial Stakes. Following this loss, her handlers decided not to enter her in the Kentucky Derby. After a two-month layoff, she came back to compete in the then-current version of New York's Triple Tiara series for fillies. She began with a six-length win in the Acorn Stakes, then ran in the 1⅛ mile Mother Goose Stakes. In this race, she faced Lite Light, whom she had easily beaten in the previous fall's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies but who at age three was a vastly improved filly. After the two ran head-to-head from the turn at the top of the homestretch, Meadow Star won by a \\"lip\\" in a photo finish that took the officials six minutes to adjudicate. The two fillies finished 15 ½ lengths in front of the rest of the field. A month later, they met again in the final leg of the Triple Tiara, the 1¼ mile Coaching Club American Oaks. Once again they pulled away from the field, going head-to-head at the top of the stretch. But this time the extra ⅛ mile was too much for Meadow Star, while Lite Light put on a powerful drive and won by seven lengths in stakes record time. After her loss in the Coaching Club American Oaks, Meadow Star was rested until early September, but in her return finished fourth in the one mile Maskette Stakes. She did not race again until April 24, 1992, and after a season that saw her go winless in five starts with two third-place finishes her best showings, she was retired to broodmare service at Trackside Farm near Versailles, Kentucky. Retirement As a broodmare, Meadow Star produced three foals from Deputy Minister and one each from Gulch, Danzig and A.P. Indy. Through her stakes-placed daughter Grechelle, Meadow Star is the third dam of champion Arrogate. On April 11, 2002, she suffered complications giving birth to a foal by Fusaichi Pegasus and died at the Hagyard Equine Medical Institute equine hospital. She is buried at Trackside Farm. Pedigree Meadow Star is inbred 4x3 to Native Dancer, meaning Native Dancer appears once in the fourth generation and once in the third generation of her pedigree.

Records of the time describe her as being a two-masted schooner, 67 feet long and 20 feet wide. At the time of the sinking her weight was listed as 74 tons, also recorded was that she was armed with three cannons; two 6-pounders and one 4-pounder. In 1835, Peter Kerr, Fernando de Leon and Jesus Carbajal chartered the Hannah Elizabeth to carry trade supplies and munitions from New Orleans to Matagorda. A portion of the shipment was for Colonel Fannin and the newly formed Texan Army in this area. On November 19, 1835, a Mexican warship, Montezuma, sighted the Hannah Elizabeth along the Texas coast. During the ensuing chase the Hannah Elizabeth became stranded on a sandbar as she attempted to enter Pass Cavallo to the safety of Matagorda Bay. The Montezuma’s crew took advantage of this and fired upon the Hannah Elizabeth, as she lay helplessly beached. The crew of the Hannah Elizabeth, realizing that their ship was about to be captured carrying contraband material, threw most of the cargo overboard. This cargo included 500 muskets, two field cannons, gunpowder and ammunition. The Montezuma’s crew proceeded to board the Hannah Elizabeth capturing her crew and leaving a small crew from the Montezuma on board to guard the stranded ship. During the evening severe weather forced the Montezuma to retreat, at which time a small Texas ship, William Robbins, recaptured the Hannah Elizabeth. A complete salvage of the vessel and her remaining cargo was thwarted when the vessel rolled over and broke up in the breakers. During the 1999 expedition to find the second La Salle ship, the L’Aimable, a wreck was found and explored that lay on the southeast side of the entrance into Pass Cavallo. In 2001 divers from the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Texas A&M; University conducted further exploration of this site. Over 200 artifacts were recovered, including the remains of muskets, cannonballs, lead shot, and many other military items that were dated from the early 19th century. After research by the THC & Texas A&M;, the Hannah Elizabeth was picked as the most likely candidate for this shipwreck.

Roadways now bearing the Black Horse Pike designation include portions of Route 168, Route 42, U.S. Route 322 (US 322) and US 40\\\\. Route description =Route 168= The Black Horse Pike heads south from US 130 in Camden as a four-lane, divided highway comprising Route 168, which continues north of US 130 on Mt. Ephraim Avenue. It heads south and interchanges Route 76C, which heads west and provides access to Interstate 76 (I-76) and the Walt Whitman Bridge. It passes through Haddon Township with many jughandles at intersections. It then passes through Mt. Ephraim, where the road was restriped in the late 1990s reducing it from four lanes to two, and enters Bellmawr, where it interchanges with exit 28 of I-295 and exit 3 of the New Jersey Turnpike (NJTP). It then enters Runnemede, where it crosses Route 41 and County Route 544 (CR 544). It then heads into Gloucester Township and interchanges with Route 42\\\\. It continues south, passing through Blackwood, where it intersects CR 534, and then widens back into a four-lane, divided highway. It then heads toward the southern terminus of the North–South Freeway (Route 42) and the western terminus of the Atlantic City Expressway, where Route 168 ends and the Black Horse Pike becomes Route 42. =Route 42= The Black Horse Pike heads south into Washington Township, Gloucester County on Route 42 as a four-lane divided highway lined with many businesses. In Cross Keys, it intersects CR 555\\\\. It then enters Monroe Township, where in Williamstown, it meets US 322 and CR 536 Spur. Here, Route 42 ends and US 322 heads east onto the Black Horse Pike. =US 322= US 322 on the Black Horse Pike in FolsomUS 322 heads southeast on the Black Horse Pike from Williamstown, intersecting CR 536 and CR 538\\\\. It heads into Folsom, Atlantic County, where it meets Route 54 at a cloverleaf interchange and then the southern terminus of Route 73\\\\. It continues into Hamilton Township, passing through rural areas. It intersects CR 559 shortly after crossing into Hamilton Township. Near Mays Landing, it features an interchange with Route 50\\\\. It continues southeast and near the Hamilton Mall and the former Atlantic City Race Course, it intersects US 40\\\\. =US 40/US 322 concurrency= US 40 joins US 322 and the two routes continue to the southeast along the Black Horse Pike. Shortly after joining, the road intersects CR 575, which then forms a concurrency on the Black Horse Pike along with US 40 and US 322. It heads into Egg Harbor Township, and Route 575 splits from the Black Horse Pike by heading south on English Creek Avenue. The Black Horse Pike has an intersection with CR 563, which was formerly a traffic circle built in 1932 until it was replaced by traffic signals and jughandles in 2002. The Black Horse Pike has a brief concurrency with CR 563 and then meets the Garden State Parkway (GSP) with access provided by way of CR 563 and CR 608\\\\. The route continues east into Pleasantville, where it crosses US 9\\\\. It then passes through the center of Pleasantville on Verona Avenue, with the name changing back to Black Horse Pike. At the border with Atlantic City, the road becomes Albany Avenue, which carries US 40 and US 322 into Atlantic City. History The Route 54 bridge over the Black Horse Pike (US 322) in Folsom, showing the former Route 42 designation. The origins of the Black Horse Pike can be traced to 1795 when surveyors working for old Gloucester County, laid out a new and straight road to replace the meandering Irish Road. The new roadway carried various names including the Newton Road, Chews Landing-Philadelphia Road, Mount Ephraim- Blackwoodtown Road, etc. State legislators incorporated the Williamstown and Good Intent Turnpike Company in 1852, and Camden and Blackwoodtown Turnpike Company in 1855, converting the road into a toll road north of Good Intent. In 1923, the portion from Mays Landing to Atlantic City became part of Route 18S. With the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the route became Route 42 from Camden to Mays Landing and Route 48 from Mays Landing to Atlantic City. US 322 was later designated along the road from Williamstown to Atlantic City and US 40 from Mays Landing to Atlantic City.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. With the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. and state routes in New Jersey, the Route 42 and Route 48 designations were removed from the parts of the road that were already signed as US 322 or US 40/US 322, with Route 42 cut back to Williamstown and Route 48 completely removed from the Black Horse Pike. Following the completion of the North–South Freeway, Route 42 was moved off the Black Horse Pike to the new freeway between Camden and Turnersville, and the Route 168 designation was given to the Black Horse Pike between Camden and Turnersville. Major intersections The mileposts correspond to the routes the Black Horse Pike follows.

It functions as a method of literary composition and analysis that involves examining apparently contradictory statements and drawing conclusions either to reconcile them or to explain their presence.Rescher, Nicholas. Paradoxes:Their Roots, Range, and Resolution. Open Court: Chicago, 2001. Literary or rhetorical paradoxes abound in the works of Oscar Wilde and G. K. Chesterton. Most literature deals with paradox of situation; Rabelais, Cervantes, Sterne, Borges, and Chesterton are recognized as masters of situation as well as verbal paradox. Statements such as Wilde's \\"I can resist anything except temptation\\" and Chesterton's \\"spies do not look like spies\\"From \\"A Tall Story\\" in The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond. are examples of rhetorical paradox. Further back, Polonius' observation that \\"though this be madness, yet there is method in't\\" is a memorable third. Also, statements that are illogical and metaphoric may be called paradoxes, for example: \\"The pike flew to the tree to sing.\\" The literal meaning is illogical, but there are many interpretations for this metaphor. A paradox may be absurd but upon closer examination rings true.James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 62. For example, Jesus’ statement in Mark 8:35, “for those who want to save their life will lose it,” is absurd. But it is resolved by the gospel writer in the second half of the verse: “those who lose their life for my sake and for the sake of the gospel, will save it.” Cleanth Brooks' \\"Language of Paradox\\" Cleanth Brooks, an active member of the New Critical movement, outlines the use of reading poems through paradox as a method of critical interpretation. Paradox in poetry means that tension at the surface of a verse can lead to apparent contradictions and hypocrisies. Brooks' seminal essay, The Language of Paradox, lays out his argument for the centrality of paradox by demonstrating that paradox is \\"the language appropriate and inevitable to poetry.\\"Literary Theory: An Anthology, 2nd Ed., Eds. Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan. The argument is based on the contention that referential language is too vague for the specific message a poet expresses; he must \\"make up his language as he goes.\\" This, Brooks argues, is because words are mutable and meaning shifts when words are placed in relation to one another.Brooks, Cleanth. The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry. New York: Reynal & Hitchcock, 1947. In the writing of poems, paradox is used as a method by which unlikely comparisons can be drawn and meaning can be extracted from poems both straightforward and enigmatic. Brooks points to William Wordsworth's poem It is a beauteous evening, calm and free. He begins by outlining the initial and surface conflict, which is that the speaker is filled with worship, while his female companion does not seem to be. The paradox, discovered by the poem's end, is that the girl is more full of worship than the speaker precisely because she is always consumed with sympathy for nature and not – as is the speaker – in tune with nature while immersed in it. In his reading of Wordsworth's poem, \\"Composed upon Westminster Bridge\\", Brooks contends that the poem offers paradox not in its details, but in the situation the speaker creates. Though London is a man-made marvel, and in many respects in opposition to nature, the speaker does not view London as a mechanical and artificial landscape but as a landscape composed entirely of nature. Since London was created by man, and man is a part of nature, London is thus too a part of nature. It is this reason that gives the speaker the opportunity to remark upon the beauty of London as he would a natural phenomenon, and, as Brooks points out, can call the houses \\"sleeping\\" rather than \\"dead\\" because they too are vivified with the natural spark of life, granted to them by the men that built them. Brooks ends his essay with a reading of John Donne's poem The Canonization, which uses a paradox as its underlying metaphor. Using a charged religious term to describe the speaker's physical love as saintly, Donne effectively argues that in rejecting the material world and withdrawing to a world of each other, the two lovers are appropriate candidates for canonization. This seems to parody both love and religion, but in fact it combines them, pairing unlikely circumstances and demonstrating their resulting complex meaning. Brooks points also to secondary paradoxes in the poem: the simultaneous duality and singleness of love, and the double and contradictory meanings of \\"die\\" in Metaphysical poetry (used here as both sexual union and literal death). He contends that these several meanings are impossible to convey at the right depth and emotion in any language but that of paradox. A similar paradox is used in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, when Juliet says, \\"For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss.\\" Brooks' contemporaries in the sciences were, in the 1940s and 50's, reorganizing university science curricula into codified disciplines. The study of English, however, remained less defined and it became a goal of the New Critical movement to justify literature in an age of science by separating the work from its author and critic (see Wimsatt and Beardsley's Intentional fallacy and Affective fallacy) and by examining it as a self-sufficient artifact. In Brooks's use of the paradox as a tool for analysis, however, he develops a logical case as a literary technique with strong emotional effect. His reading of \\"The Canonization\\" in The Language of Paradox, where paradox becomes central to expressing complicated ideas of sacred and secular love, provides an example of this development. Paradox and irony Although paradox and irony as New Critical tools for reading poetry are often conflated, they are independent poetical devices. Irony for Brooks is \\"the obvious warping of a statement by the context\\"Brooks, Cleanth. \\"Irony as a Principle of Structure.\\" In Critical Theory Since Plato, edited by Hazard Adams. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1971. whereas paradox is later glossed as a special kind of qualification that \\"involves the resolution of opposites.\\"Crane, R.S. \\"Cleanth Brooks; Or, The Bankruptcy of Critical Monism.\\" In Modern Philology, Vol. 45, No. 4 (May 1948) pp 226-245. Irony functions as a presence in the text – the overriding context of the surrounding words that make up the poem. Only sentences such as 2 + 2 = 4 are free from irony; most other statements are prey to their immediate context and are altered by it (take, as an example, the following joke. \\"A woman walks into a bar and asks for a double entendre. The bartender gives it to her.\\" This last statement, perfectly acceptable elsewhere, is transformed by its context in the joke to an innuendo). Irony is the key to validating the poem because a test of any statement grows from the context – validating a statement demands examining the statement in the context of the poem and determining whether it is appropriate to that context. Paradox, however, is essential to the structure and being of the poem. In The Well Wrought Urn Brooks shows that paradox was so essential to poetic meaning that paradox was almost identical to poetry. According to literary theorist Leroy Searle, Brooks' use of paradox emphasized the indeterminate lines between form and content. \\"The form of the poem uniquely embodies its meaning,\\" and the language of the poem \\"affects the reconciliation of opposites or contraries.\\" While irony functions within the poem, paradox often refers to the meaning and structure of the poem and is thus inclusive of irony.Searle, Leroy. \\"New Criticism.\\" In The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism, 2nd edition. Edited by Michael Groden, Martin Kreiswirth, and Imre Szeman. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005. This existence of opposites or contraries and the reconciliation thereof is poetry and the meaning of the poem. Criticism R.S. Crane, in his essay The Critical Monism of Cleanth Brooks, argues strongly against Brooks' centrality of paradox. For one, Brooks believes that the very structure of poetry is paradox, and ignores the other subtleties of imagination and power that poets bring to their poems. Brooks simply believed that, \\"'Imagination' reveals itself in the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.\\" Brooks, in leaning on the crutch of paradox, only discusses the truth poetry can reveal, and speaks nothing about the pleasure it can give. (231) Also, by defining poetry as uniquely having a structure of paradox, Brooks ignores the power of paradox in everyday conversation and discourse, including scientific discourse, which Brooks claimed was opposed to poetry. Crane claims that, using Brooks' definition of poetry, the most powerful paradoxical poem in modern history is Einstein's formula E = mc2, which is a profound paradox in that matter and energy are the same thing. The argument for the centrality of paradox (and irony) becomes a reductio ad absurdum and is therefore void (or at least ineffective) for literary analysis.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Congleton. History The Domesday Book (c. 1086) records the presence of a priest and a church on the site of the present church, and it is shown on an 1840 map of the town centre of Sandbach.Sandbach 1840 town centre map, copy also at Sandbach Library This was replaced by another church erected about the time of Henry VII. This church was built in sandstone which became badly weathered. The present church dates largely from the considerable degree of rebuilding by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1847–49. Much of the existing fabric was replaced and the remaining fabric was encased in new stone. The east end of the church was extended by some and the tower was rebuilt as a copy of the former tower. The builders were Cooper and Son of Derby. The stone, which came from quarries in the Mow Cop area, was given by Sir Philip Grey Egerton M.P. Part of the west end had to be repaired in 1894–95 following a fire. In 1930 Austin and Paley added a choir vestry, and a north porch, at a cost of £1,331. The parish registers date from 1562 and are complete. The churchwardens' accounts prior to 1888 are lost. Architecture =Exterior= The plan of the church consists of a clerestoried nave and a choir of five bays, with aisles, side chapels, and a tower at the west end. The choir vestry projects from the northwest. The tower is unusual in that it stands on three open arches through which passes a public footpath. The style is mainly Perpendicular and some medieval masonry is still present in the arcades. =Interior= The font dates from 1859; it is made of Caen stone and was constructed by Thomas Stringer. It has a Greek Palindrome inscription, that reads \\"NIYON ANOMHMA MH MONAN OYINE\\". This translated means \\"Wash my sin not my countenance only\\".Sandbach Guide 1970 page 9 The old octagonal font dated 1669 and decorated with acanthus leaves, was returned to the church in 1938. Scott arranged the memorials around the walls of the aisles. One of these is a marble relief to the memory of Rev. John Armistead, who was vicar from 1828 to 1865. It was designed by G. F. Watts and sculpted by George Nelson in 1876. Another is to John Ford, who died in 1839, which includes a life-size allegorical female figure by an altar. The roofs are dated 1661. The roof over the north aisle includes a large coat of arms in a wreath. In the chapels and chancels is stained glass by William Wailes, and in the north aisle is a window by Kempe. =Bells= There is a ring of eight bells. Four of the bells were cast by Abraham II Rudhall in 1719, and a bell dated 1782 is attributed to Thomas Rudhall. Three later bells by John Warner and Sons are dated 1857, 1858 and 1868. External features The churchyard walls, gateways and railings to south-east and north of the church are listed at Grade II.

Cyclone Daman was the fourth tropical depression and the first severe tropical cyclone to form east of longitude 180° during the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season. Due to the severity of the storm, the name Daman was retired and replaced with Denia. On December 3, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, upgraded a tropical disturbance, located to the west of the Solomon Islands, to Tropical Depression 04F. On December 5, as the depression moved towards the west into the Fijian archipelago, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and RSMC Nadi upgraded it to Cyclone Daman. On December 7 the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 185 km/h, (115 mph 10-minute sustained) which made Daman a Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. Later that day Daman also reached its peak intensity by 1-minute means with winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) which made it a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Early on December 8, Cyclone Daman brushed by the Fijian island of Cikobia, causing damage to housing, crops and vegetation. Daman then weakened the next day into a tropical depression and dissipated on December 10\\\\. Meteorological history During December 3, the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that an area of atmospheric convection, had persisted about to the north-west of Suva the capital of Fiji. At this time the system was located within an area of minimal vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Over the next two days, the depression moved towards the west, conditions surrounding the depression barely changed and as a result the depression steadily intensified. Early on December 5, the system had convective bands spiraling into and wrapping tightly around the low level circulation center. As a result of this, the JTWC started advisories on Tropical Cyclone 05P, with winds equivalent to a tropical storm. At 0200 UTC, RSMC Nadi reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it as Daman. During that day Daman passed over Rotuma island while gradually intensifying further. At 0600 UTC, on December 6, the JTWC reported that Daman had intensified into a category one tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane scale. Shortly after this, the cyclone made an abrupt turn and started to move towards the east instead of moving towards the south. Later that day at 1200 UTC, RSMC Nadi reported that Daman had intensified into a category three severe tropical cyclone as it was now sporting a cloud filled eye. The cyclone continued to intensify over the next 12 hours becoming a category four severe tropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on December 7. At that time RSMC Nadi forecasted, that there was a possibility that Daman could become a category five severe tropical cyclone, with windspeeds of 215 km/h, (130 mph), within 12 hours. However six hours later as the general organization of the eye had weakened, RSMC Nadi reported that the cyclone had peaked as a category four severe tropical cyclone with ten-minute winds of 195 km/h, (120 mph) and a peak pressure of . The JTWC also reported that Cyclone Daman had peaked with one-minute winds of 195 km/h, (120 mph). In their post storm analysis, both RSMC Nadi and the JTWC revised their estimated peak windspeeds, with RSMC Nadi lowering their estimated windspeeds to 185 km/h, (115 mph), while the JTWC elevated their estimates to 205 km/h, (125 mph). As the Cyclone peaked in intensity, it started to accelerate towards the southeast and passed over or close to Thikombia island, before becoming under the influence of a mid-level ridge of high pressure. As it came under the influence of the mid-level ridge of high pressure, Daman turned once more and started to move slowly towards the southeast, into an area of strengthening vertical windshear and cooler sea surface temperatures. As a result, Daman rapidly weakened during December 8, before both the next day as the system moved through the Lau Islands, both the JTWC and RSMC Nadi reported that it had weakened into a tropical depression. The final advisories on the system were issued the next day as Daman merged with a frontal system. Effects Severe Tropical Cyclone Daman impacted Fiji and its dependency of Rotuma between December 5 – 9, where it caused about F$500,000 (2007) ($330,000 US$2007) worth of damage. On December 5, the FMS issued a gale warning for Rotuma and warned that Daman was expected to pass near or over the Fijian dependency. The system subsequently passed over the island later that day, where it caused no serious damage, but pushed the cruise ship MV Lycianda on to a reef which suffered some damage to its rudders and propellers. Early on December 5, RSMC Nadi started to issue special weather bulletins on Cyclone Daman as a tropical cyclone gale warning had been issued for the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. Later that morning, as the Cyclone moved over Rotuma, RSMC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert for the rest of Fiji. During that afternoon, RSMC Nadi canceled the tropical cyclone gale warning for Rotuma and then upgraded the cyclone alerts for the northwest of Fiji to a tropical cyclone gale warning later that day. Early the next day, as the storm was intensifying, they upgraded the gale warnings for parts of northwest of Fiji to storm warnings while expanding the warnings to the western and central sides of Viti Levu and the western side of Vanua Levu. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi further revised the warnings as Cyclone Daman had become a severe tropical cyclone. A hurricane warning was then declared at this time for the Yasawa Group, northern Viti Levu, Vanua Levu as well as smaller islands located nearby. Later that day, as Daman reached its peak, all areas of Fiji were under a gale warning. Early on December 7 RSMC Nadi canceled some of the warnings for Fiji, including the gale force warning for southwestern Viti Levu, and then later that day downgraded all the warnings that were still in effect for Fiji to gale force as Daman was weakening. Cyclone Daman brought heavy rain which caused floods and landslides within Fiji's northern division. This led to several international and domestic flights being canceled on December 7. The Fijian island of Cikobia received a direct hit whilst Daman passed directly over Rotuma. The total cost to Fiji from Cyclone Daman was F$500,000 (2007) ($330,000 US$2007) with no damage being reported in Tonga from the storm. Daman did most of its damages on Cikobia island, which has a population of around 120. Damage on Cikobia included extensive damages to houses, school buildings, crops, fruitbearing trees and foliage. Water pipes were damaged by fallen trees as a result of high winds from the storm. Despite initial fears of there being some fatalities on Cikobia, no loss of life was recorded due to the storm. This was because the islands 120 residents had evacuated to caves on Cikobia. The Fijian Dependency of Rotuma experienced a significant amount of rainfall from December 5 until December 7, when Cyclone Daman was located near Rotuma. Because there were no deaths and only 65 people had been directly affected by Cyclone Daman, the Fijian government, with the help of the Red Cross, decided not to request any International Aid or any external assistance. The Fijian Government, on January 15, 2008, allocated $530,000 2008 FJD for the relief and rehabilitation programme of Cikobia. By August 2008, all work rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone Daman had been completed. Due to the impact of this system, the name Daman was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization.

The character wanders around a 1920s film set, searching for five Oscar Statues while being chased by a series of Policemen. The studios are also haunted by a number of ghosts who attack Buster at random. If Buster comes into contact with either one, the game ends. During his search, Buster can occasionally find himself in the middle of a street scene where he has to survive wave after wave of policemen.

On August 18, 2011, in a game against the San Francisco Giants, Minor pitched six scoreless innings including facing the minimum number of batters over the last four innings. This victory was the first time in 17 major league starts that Minor did not give up a run. On May 25, 2013, Minor hit his first career home run off Dillon Gee of the New York Mets in a 6–0 win. On August 22, 2014, Minor pitched no-hit innings, before giving up an RBI single to the Reds' Billy Hamilton. The Braves eventually won the game in the 12th inning on Justin Upton's two-run home run. Minor finished the 2014 season with a 6–12 record and 4.77 ERA, pitching most of the year with a sore shoulder. In 2015, Minor became the first Brave since John Rocker in 2001 to challenge the team in an arbitration hearing. He won and was awarded $5.6 million. On March 3, 2015, Minor again began feeling tightness in his shoulder and was diagnosed with rotator cuff inflammation. As a result, he was placed on the disabled list on March 10. Minor attempted to start throwing programs in mid-March and early April, but felt discomfort both times. He was moved to the 60-day disabled list on May 2. Eleven days later, Minor underwent surgery for a torn labrum, and missed the rest of the season. Minor became a free agent on December 2, 2015, when the Braves opted not to tender him a contract. =Kansas City Royals= Minor signed a two-year contract with the Kansas City Royals worth $7.25 million with a club option worth $10 million for the 2018 season on February 19, 2016.http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt- columns-blogs/k-zone/article61316987.html Minor began the 2016 season on the 60-day disabled list, still recovering from his previous shoulder surgery, and did not throw a pitch in the Majors for the entire year. Because of his troubles staying healthy, the Royals announced that Minor would pitch out of the bullpen in 2017. A move to relief brought tremendous results for Minor, who saw his average fastball velocity climb to nearly 95 miles per hour, compared to 91 miles per hour as a starter. Minor would emerge as one of the Royals best relievers, finishing with a 2.55 ERA and six saves, with 88 strikeouts in 77 innings. Despite his success out of the bullpen, Minor returned to starting in 2018. =Texas Rangers= On December 4, 2017, Minor signed with the Texas Rangers to a three-year, $28 million deal. In 2018, Minor went 12–8 with a 4.18 ERA and 110 strikeouts in 157 innings. In 2019, after posting an MLB-leading 2.40 ERA in his first 17 starts, Minor was selected as an American League pitcher for the 2019 Major League Baseball All- Star Game. However, because he was scheduled to start the Sunday before the All-Star Game, he did not play. Minor finished the 2019 season after going 14–10 with a 3.59 ERA and 200 strikeouts over innings. Minor finished 8th in the 2019 AL Cy Young Award voting. =Oakland Athletics= On August 31, 2020, Minor was traded to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for Dustin Harris and Marcus Smith. Pitch repertoire Minor leads with a four-seam fastball at 89–93 mph, a pitch he throws more than half the time. In relatively equal amounts he throws a slider (83–86), a circle change (82–84), and a knuckle curve (77–80). Left-handed hitters rarely see the changeup, especially with two strikes. The curve has a whiff rate of 39% over Minor's career. He has produced one of the league's lowest ground ball/fly ball ratios since he debuted.

Life Roazen received his A.B. at Harvard University in 1958. He then studied at the University of Chicago and Magdalen College, Oxford, before returning to Harvard for his PhD dissertation, which bore on Freud's political and social thought. After teaching at Harvard as an assistant professor in Government, he taught Social and Political Science at York University in Toronto from 1971 until his early retirement in 1995. In 1965 Roazen began to interview surviving friends, relatives, colleagues and patients of Sigmund Freud. His first 'big' book, Freud and His Followers, was based on hundreds of hours of material. This was a path-breaking and influential work, which remains a basic reference for historians of psychoanalysis today. Roazen was the first non- psychoanalyst whom Anna Freud allowed to access the archives of the British Psychoanalytic Institute. He was able to see the huge amount of material Ernest Jones had used to write his biography of Freud. In 1993 Roazen became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. His papers are collected in the Paul Roazen Collection of the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.

Alternate voting systems In 1936, voters in New York City adopted the single transferable vote method of proportional representation. In the election immediately preceding STV's adoption, the Democrats won 95.3% of the seats on the Board of Aldermen with only 66.5% of the vote. In 1941, proportional representation gave the Democrats 65.5% of the seats on 64% of the vote, with the Republicans and three smaller parties also gaining seats in proportion to their voting strength.A Brief History of Full Representation in the United States, Douglas J. Amy, Department of Politics, Mount Holyoke College, Representation 34, number 1 (Winter 1996/7). The system has since been repealed. However, the Conservative Party and Liberal Party continue to participate in the electoral system through electoral fusion. Expansion of the electorate New York disenfranchises felons both while they are in prison and while they are on parole. The Sentencing Project favors restoring these rights. New York allows absentee ballots for \\"registered voters who cannot make it to the polls on Election Day because of occupation, business, studies, travel, imprisonment (other than a convicted felon), illness, disability and hospitalization or resident in a long term care facility\\".Absentee Voting, Board of Elections in the City of New York. Allocation of electoral votes In both 2006 and 2007, bills were introduced in the New York Legislature to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and award the state's 31 electoral votes to the winner of the nationwide popular vote. Both proposals failed. The legislation later succeeded in 2014 when New York joined the compact. Ballot access A new party or independent candidate may gain ballot access for one election by collecting a set number of petition signatures for each office (or 5 percent of the votes cast for governor in the most recent election in the jurisdiction, if that is lower). A new party that wins 50,000 votes for governor is recognized statewide as a political party and qualifies to participate in primary elections for four years. This total can be and often is obtained through electoral fusion. Candidates may gain access to primary election ballots by being \\"designated\\" by a relevant committee of the party or collecting signatures equal to 5 percent of the party's enrollment in the jurisdiction, up to a set number for each office. A candidate seeking the nomination of a party to which she or he does not belong - e.g. for purposes of fusion - must be authorized by a relevant committee of the party.

With his two brothers, Jeremiah and Thomas, he took over the lease of Anthony Bacon's cannon foundry at Cyfarthfa, before they began the Penydarren Ironworks during the 1780s. In 1784, after a court caseMerthyr Historian, Vol 15, pp.33–35 they transferred the lease of the foundry from Anthony Bacon (with whom they had quarrelled), who reassigned it to David Tanner, and moved to where they had set up the works on the banks of the River Morlais, building Penydarren House on the far side river bank. After years of fierce competition with the Dowlais and Cyfarthfa ironworks, they began to prosper. Samuel took over as proprietor of the Penydarren works, while Jeremiah moved to Ebbw Vale. Samuel was one of the chief promoters of the Glamorgan canal, which opened in 1795 and cost £103,000, of which he subscribed £40,000 and which enabled the transporting of heavy manufactured iron to Cardiff docks. In 1804 Samuel won a 1000 guineas wager with Richard Crawshay as to which of them could first build a steam locomotive for use in their works. Homfray employed Richard Trevithick for this purpose and his locomotive won the bet, hauling five wagons, carrying ten tons of iron and seventy men, at a speed of five miles an hour. In 1800, Samuel married Jane Morgan, daughter of Sir Charles Gould Morgan, 1st Baronet of Tredegar House, and thus obtained a favorable lease of mineral land at Tredegar, where he established the Tredegar Ironworks. In 1813 he was appointed High Sheriff of Monmouthshire and in 1818, returned as Member of Parliament for Stafford borough. Family Of the children of Samuel and Jane Homfray: *Two sons.

In its retrospective review, AllMusic notes that while the album was confusing to audiences at the time of its release, it became inspirational for dozens of groups to follow.

It was known for its lobsters and its Bookbinder's soup. The restaurant was decorated with bas-reliefs of U.S. Presidents on its stained- glass facade and the Gettysburg Address written in bronze near the front door. The lobby held the world's largest indoor lobster tank; it could accommodate 350 lobsters.  History  The restaurant's history can be traced to the oyster saloon opened in 1893 on Fifth Street near South Street by Dutch-Jewish immigrant Samuel Bookbinder. In 1898, Bookbinder moved it to Second and Walnut streets to be closer to the docks. The restaurant left the family in the 1930s when it was bequeathed to the Jewish Federated Charities. John M. Taxin, the last owner's grandson, bought it with partners Hyman B. Sichel and Jimmy Retana in 1945, according to city records. A few years later, after buying out his partners, Taxin added \\"Old Original\\" to differentiate it from Bookbinders Seafood House, which two of Samuel Bookbinder's grandsons opened in 1935 on 15th Street near Locust. (The 15th Street restaurant closed in 2004.) During World War II and the Korean War, when young men were sworn into the military at the Customs House a block away, Taxin offered free lunches to the recruits, who spread the word about the offer. He also promoted the myth that the restaurant's origin was 1865. Until he retired in the 1980s, he ran Bookbinder's with his son, Albert Taxin. Albert Taxin died of a brain tumor in 1993, and his son, John E., took it over with Albert's sister, Sandy. John M. Taxin died in 1997 at age 90. John E. Taxin closed the restaurant for renovations just after New Year's Day 2002. After a $4.5-million renovation that added condominiums, a downsized version opened in early 2005. In 2006, less than 16 months later, the restaurant filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At a hearing on April 29, 2009, Judge Eric L. Frank agreed with most creditors and the U.S. trustee that converting the case to Chapter 7 – liquidating its assets under court supervision – would not be productive because of the high administrative costs. Old Original Bookbinder's bankruptcy petition was dismissed on April 29, 2009. Creditors, owed about $1.8 million, had to find a way outside of U.S. Bankruptcy Court to seek reimbursement. In April 2009, John E. Taxin closed the restaurant. Albert A. Ciardi III, the restaurant's bankruptcy attorney, said in May 2009 that two interested parties had come forward in the previous month, but that no sale had taken place. The historical location was reopened on January 9, 2015, by Chef Jose Garces and the Garces Group. Renamed the Olde Bar, the restaurant was transformed into a mix of seafood saloon and private catering space. In late 2017 and early 2018, Garces Group was sued for payment by vendors, investors, and a landlord, indicating financial trouble. News reports indicate that Garces wanted to have the group declare bankruptcy, but the original investors objected. After significant legal wrangling where Garces' lawyers divided his share of Garces Group into separate entities with voting rights to outnumber the investors' votes, Garces Restaurant Group filed for bankruptcy in Camden, NJ in May 2018. Ultimately, Garces Group was acquired by Louisiana- based hospitality company Ballard Brands in a sale that was approved by the bankruptcy court in July 2018. Ballard Brands continues to operate the Olde Bar. The Bookbinder's name and much of the historical woodwork and decor remain and have been restored.

Lynn Brewer has since falsely used the \\"whistleblower\\" title to gain employment. Controlling $1MM in salaries at Enron at the time amounted to a total of 5-6 employees - a tiny group within Enron that was relatively insignificant. It has been confirmed that Brewer was a back office clerk who lies without pause about how the FBI is watching her by monitoring her emails, texts and phone calls. The FBI doesn’t even know or care who she is. She and her husband are presently dealing with incredible financial hardship and most recently had to sell their \\"farm\\" in Washington State and they are facing foreclosure on their primary residence. Career at Enron In 1998, Brewer was hired as a senior specialist at Enron. Her job at Enron was to head up a team that examined natural gas and power contracts, and write brief summaries for managers. Brewer was a regular speaker at universities, where she lectured students on the importance of ethics in business. She provided the keynote address at the Sarbanes-Oxley conference hosted by the New York Stock Exchange in 2003. Brewer co-authored an article in Business Strategy Review with noted management expert Oren Harari on leadership. Dispute about whistleblower claim A USA today article by Greg Farrell, based on interviews with two dozen former colleagues, found that her claim to be a former Enron Executive and as the first whistleblower at Enron could not be substantiated. Her former colleagues described her claim as exaggerated. Former Enron employees claimed that she mainly did clerical work at Enron, and lost her job after failing to complete an assignment to teach a workshop in London. According to USA Today, Brewer took advantage of her similarity to a real whistle-blower at Enron, Sherron Watkins. Brewer said that \\"...we'd hope that all the time we're confused with her (Sherron Watkins).\\" In her defense, Brewer claimed that she headed up a contract briefing team, she controlled more than $1 million in salaries and overall budget, therefore, she considered herself an executive. Brewer stated that she was out speaking publicly about Enron well before Watkins was ever on the cover of Time magazine. Lynn Brewer told Puget Sound Business Journal she would ask USA Today for an apology for the 12 October 2007 article that questioned her claim to be an Enron whistle-blower, and that otherwise she would take her complaint to the Washington News Council, an organization that handles media disputes.

Alternate voting systems Voters in Sarasota, Florida voted to switch to instant runoff voting in November 2007.Coming to a polling place near you: instant runoffs , Rick Barry, Pelican Press, January 12th 2007. Ballots Florida came under pressure to reform its mechanical butterfly ballot system after that system was associated with a sufficient number of spoiled ballots to have decided the 2000 U.S. presidential election. The card punchers in some cases became clogged with chads which prevented ballots from punching completely through, resulting in an undervote. They were largely replaced with touchscreen electronic voting machines. A more recent requirement is for paper ballots or a voter-verified paper record of some type. Some counties are in process of transitioning away from DRE (Direct Recording Electronic voting machines), except possibly for certain persons with disabilities who need specific accommodations. SB7066, Amendment 834194, also contains language to control the use of BMDs (Ballot Marking Devices): \\"(41) “Voter interface device” means any device that communicates voting instructions and ballot information to a voter and allows the voter to select and vote for candidates and issues. A voter interface device may not be used to tabulate votes. Any vote tabulation must be based upon a subsequent scan of the marked marksense ballot or the voter-verifiable paper output after the voter interface device process has been completed.\\" In light of the successful Russian hacking into the election systems of two Florida counties in the 2016 election, as documented in Volume 1 of the Mueller Report, additional attention is being focused on securing Florida voting systems and county electronic voter registration pollbooks prior to the 2020 election. Expansion of the electorate Florida previously had rigorous felony disenfranchisement laws that denied approximately 400,000 people the privilege of votingFlorida Ex-Offenders Barred from Vote Decisive in Election, Human Rights Watch. In 2007, at the urging of Gov. Charlie Crist, the laws were relaxed, allowing hundreds of thousands of non-violent offenders to regain their voting rights after having served their prison terms. In 2018, Amendment 4 to the Florida Constitution was passed statewide by voters, and the laws were relaxed, which would allow most ex-felons (totally 1.4 million in Florida) to regain the right to vote. However, the 2019 Florida State Legislature, in direct contradiction to the expressed will of the voters, passed SB7066, which once again severely restricted the right of ex-felons to register to vote if they might still owe monies for court costs, fines, or restitution. Since the process of verifying what monies are still owed is extremely cumbersome, due to multiple information sources and records that may be non-existent or scattered in various departments, efforts are being made in some counties to streamline the verification process.

Biography Guépratte was born in Granville to a family of naval officers. He studied at the Lycée impérial in Brest from 1868, and joined the École Navale on 1 October 1871. He was made an officer on 5 October 1874, and promoted to Enseigne de vaisseau on 1 December 1877. He served in Tunisia aboard the Marengo. He studied torpedo operations and served on the Amiral Duperré as a torpedo expert before receiving his first command in 1889. In 1891, he was second officer of the Forfait. He went on to command the gunboat Caronade in Indochina, the anti-submarine defences of Brest, a destroyer and the cruiser Foudre, rising in rank to capitaine de vaisseau. In 26 May 1906, Guépratte took command of the Jeanne d'Arc. Guépratte was promoted to contre- amiral on 2 September 1912. At the outbreak of the First World War, he led a squadron of old battleships in the Mediterranean. He was sent to the Dardanelles to back the British Mediterranean Fleet of Admiral Sackville Carden. On 3 November 1914, the Suffren, Vérité, Indomitable and Indefatigable started shelling the forts defending the strait, initiating the Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign. The main attack took place on 18 March, Guépratte leading the forwards squadron. The fleet was taken into a well-prepared minefield, under fire from coastal artillery. The Irresistible, Ocean and Bouvet were sunk; the French flagship Suffren was seriously damaged, as well as the Gaulois. Nevertheless, Admiral John de Robeck lauded the spirit of the French line. Guépratte took part in the naval part of the later joint operation with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, deploring the lack of first-class French units in the theater. He was eventually promoted to vice- admiral on 10 October 1915, allegedly to bring him away from combat operations, where he was deemed impetuous, to a safer area of activity. Guépratte was retired on 30 August 1918 and took up a career as a politician. He was elected to the National Assembly of France on 16 November 1919 on a left-wing list. He specialised in parliamentary affairs of the Navy. He retired from political life in 1924. He died in Brest in 1939.

Although their weekly radio series ended in 1997 and their television series ended in 2008, the troupe remained active until 2019, with annual New Year's Eve specials on CBC Television. CBC announced that, due to budgetary constraints, the special scheduled to air on December 30, 2019 would be the final in the series.  History  = Theatre revue and radio years = The group started in Montreal, Quebec in 1970 as an improvisational theatre revue called The Jest Society, a pun on then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's famous goal of making Canada a \\"just society\\". The original cast was John Morgan, Martin Bronstein, Patrick Conlon, Gay Claitman, and Roger Abbott. The troupe moved to Toronto where it had a long-term residency at the Poor Alex Theatre. Steve Whistance- Smith was briefly a member, replacing Patrick Conlon who declined to continue commuting to Toronto from Montreal, and then Don Ferguson joined when Whistance-Smith left. The show was favourably reviewed by local theatre critics, attracting the attention of CBC Radio, which commissioned the troupe to perform sketches on its weekly variety show, The Entertainers; the sketches were taped at a CBC studio without a live audience. After a number of personnel changes, the group became the \\"Royal Canadian Air Farce\\" in 1973 when the troupe was given its own show, taped in front of a live audience at the Curtain Club in Richmond Hill, Ontario. The CBC gives the date of the first broadcast as December 9, 1973. By this time the lineup consisted of Roger Abbott, Luba Goy, John Morgan, Dave Broadfoot, and Martin Bronstein. At this point Don Ferguson was a writer on the show. They quickly became one of the network's most popular programs. Most of their later shows were based in Toronto and recorded in CBC's Cabbagetown Studios; however as the troupe became more popular, they frequently travelled throughout the country to record their weekly radio broadcasts, which featured a mixture of political and cultural satire heavily influenced by the style of Wayne and Shuster. The touring show also often included one or more sketches satirizing local culture or politics, which were not aired on the national radio broadcast. Bronstein ceased performing with the troupe in 1974 to pursue a full-time journalism career, but continued to write for the Air Farce until the late 1970s. Ferguson, who had been a writer on the show's first season, swapped placed with Bronstein, becoming a writer-performer.Martin Bronstein's Bio 1999-2003 copyright SquashTalk.com In 1977, non-performing writers Gord Holtam and Rick Olsen joined the crew. In the late 1970s during a trip to Los Angeles, Abbott and Ferguson were offered jobs writing for the new television sitcom Taxi, but opted to remain with Air Farce instead.\\"Remembering Roger Abbott\\". Q, March 28, 2011. Recurring characters included addle-brained hockey player Big Bobby Clobber (Broadfoot), Sgt. Renfrew of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Broadfoot), and socialite Amy De La Pompa (Morgan), along with political figures such as Brian Mulroney, Joe Clark, and Pierre Trudeau. Additional characters included Prof. Hieronymus Wombat of the National Research Council and funeral director Hector Baggley. Another recurring character, making vacant-minded political comments, was the Honourable David J. Broadfoot, Member of Parliament for Kicking Horse Pass and leader of the New Apathetic Party. Broadfoot had been performing as this character for years, and had appeared on Canadian and American television as \\"The Honourable Member\\" as early as the 1950s, long before his tenure with Air Farce. Air Farce Productions Inc., which was incorporated in 1978, is the legal owner of the Royal Canadian Air Farce and owns the troupe's output. John Morgan, Roger Abbott, and Don Ferguson were the long-time business partners. Morgan sold his share of the company to Abbot and Ferguson, when he retired in 2001. Since the death of Abbot in 2011, Don Ferguson has been the company's sole owner. Ferguson has been the producer of the Air Farce television series since 2004 and has been the executive producer of the annual Air Farce New Year's Eve specials since 2010. = Trying out TV = In 1977, Air Farce writers Abbott, Broadfoot, Ferguson, and Morgan adapted several of their radio sketches for television, in addition to writing new material. The sketches were aired as the first two episodes of the six-part CBC series Krazy House, a compendium of sketch comedy pieces from various Canadian writers and performers that aired in January and February 1977. Broadfoot was the only Air Farce cast member to appear on-camera in these two episodes, which also starred Billy Van, amongst others. The fifth episode of Krazy House was written entirely by Morgan, and featured Air Farce cast member Luba Goy along with Billy Van, Harvey Atkin, and others. The Farce troupe recorded a one-hour television special in 1980, which evolved into a ten-week series and two sequel specials in addition to their regular radio series. The shows were performed in front of a live studio audience, mixing fully produced sketches with some sketches that were essentially staged versions of the radio show, featuring the cast members standing around a microphone reading from scripts rather than acting out the roles. Despite the decent ratings for the initial special, simply staging the radio sketches did not translate well on television, and the Air Farce faded from CBC TV by 1983. In 1984, the troupe's live Toronto stage show was videotaped as a pay-TV special, and subsequently broadcast on Ontario's Global Television Network. The troupe continued on radio though, where they flourished for the next decade. While the first decade of the show was largely recorded before a live audience at CBC Radio's Cabbagetown studio in Toronto, from 1984 to 1992 the show was recorded for broadcast on the road in communities across Canada. In this period, troupe also performed in non- broadcast concert and theatrical performances across North America. Some popular sketches in the late 1980s and early 1990s included \\"joint broadcasts\\" by CTV and CBC, overlaying opening theme music. When The Journal debuted on CBC in 1982, Air Farce spoofed the program's repeated use of the \\"sounder\\", and the use of satellite to connect people to talk to one another (including husband in living room to wife in the kitchen), as well as the seeming similarity between original hosts Barbara Frum and Mary Lou Finlay. In the early 1980s, Air Farce's summer radio hiatus periods were filled by another comedy troupe, the Frantics, who later moved on to their own TV series, Four on the Floor. Later summer hiatus periods, however, were filled by Ferguson and Abbott playing classic comedy recordings, or by newer comedy troupes such as Radio Free Vestibule. In the late 1980s, CBC Radio launched another 30-minutes weekly political satire, Double Exposure. Broadfoot retired from the troupe in 1989, although he continued to make guest appearances with Air Farce for many years afterward, on both radio and TV. Barbara Budd was also a frequent guest of the troupe, appearing in many radio episodes of the 1980s and early 1990s, although she was never an official cast member. = Success with TV = In 1992, Air Farce took a second plunge into television with 1992: Year of the Farce, a satirical New Year's Eve special. This time, the troupe elected to perform all their sketches in a more traditional (if low-budget) TV style, rather than performing some of them in front of a radio microphone. A ratings smash, the special led the troupe to produce another weekly television series, which debuted in 1993. However, this time the move to television was permanent. The radio series continued alongside the TV show for four seasons until May 1997, when it was discontinued. The practice of having a show on New Year's Eve continued to the end of the program, and such episodes were typically titled \\"Year of the Farce\\". In recent years, Air Farce also had the honour of counting down the seconds before the New Year on CBC. Recurring characters on the TV series included the slow Albertan Mike, from Canmore (Morgan) and angry Scot Jock McBile (Morgan), self-righteous movie critic Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me (Abbott), and chain-smoking bingo player Brenda (Goy). Though these characters would occasionally feature in sketches of their own, usually they were used at the beginning of the show to deliver a stream of one-line jokes commenting on the news of that week. The show also featured frequent sketches with politicians, who were portrayed as various extreme caricatures of their most infamous personality quirks. Notable re-occurring figures included Prime Minister Jean Chrétien (Abbott), who could barely speak a single sentence of English without committing at least a dozen outlandish pronunciation and grammatical errors; the nasally voiced Preston Manning (Ferguson) who loved to shout \\"REFOOOOOOORM!\\"; a screaming, bitchy Sheila Copps (Goy); the tyrannical Lucien Bouchard; the dopey and overly image conscious Stockwell Day; the strutting, clucking, pompous Joe Clark; and the power-hungry Paul Martin (all Ferguson). Many of the real politicians also made guest appearances on the show, often interacting directly with their parodic counterparts: for example, in one sketch late in the show's run, Ferguson played Jack Layton answering questions at a press conference; midway through the sketch he requested a moment to consult with his \\"top advisor\\", and out came the real Jack Layton. However, Colonel \\"Teresa\\" Stacy (Ferguson) quickly emerged as the show's most popular character—each time he appeared, Stacy would load up the Chicken Cannon and fire rubber chickens and other assorted projectiles at whomever he deemed the most annoying public figure of the week (or year). Morgan retired from Air Farce in 2001, and the remaining three members carried on with a rotating stable of guest stars until Jessica Holmes joined the show in 2003. Holmes added celebrity figures such as Paris Hilton and Liza Minnelli, and Canadian politicians such as Belinda Stronach, to the troupe's roster of characters. Later, in 2005, after a lockout at CBC, Air Farce gained two new cast members, who had previously appeared on the show as recurring guest stars: Alan Park and Craig Lauzon. The addition of these two newcomers brought the total number of performers in the troupe to six. Park initially only signed on to do rant-like segments, saying in interviews that he'd never play a character, but ended up taking on roles including Barack Obama. Lauzon regularly portrayed Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, taking his stiff public persona and creating a generally robotic character. While the show was held up as de facto Canadian tradition, some critics felt that the television show's quality had diminished over the past few seasons, especially since the breakdown of the original four-actor quartet. However, it still continued to draw solid ratings each week. On March 30, 2007, the Air Farce celebrated their 300th episode by doing the show on live television (except in Western Canada) for one hour. Roger Abbott and Luba Goy began the show with a brief history of the show, closing with \\"the scariest three words on television: AIR FARCE LIVE!\\". After this experimental episode, CBC announced that the 15th season of the series would be aired live for the entire season, with a name change to Air Farce Live. With the new live format, Penelope Corrin, who filled in for Holmes during her pregnancy in early 2007, officially joined the troupe, increasing its number to seven. Abbott, Morgan, Goy, Ferguson, and Broadfoot had cameo appearances in The Red Green Show's movie spinoff Duct Tape Forever. On April 1, 2008, the CBC and Air Farce jointly announced that the Royal Canadian Air Farce would wrap up its weekly television show in the 2008/2009 season. The plan as announced was for nine new Air Farce shows to be produced for the fall of 2008, and then the series would end with a New Year's Eve special at the end of 2008. =New Year's Eve reunion specials= Air Farce returned on December 31, 2009 for a New Year's special, featuring the return of most of the original cast (excluding Jessica Holmes, who had a theatrical commitment). As well, long- time writers Holtham and Olson retired, and did not write for this or any subsequent reunion show. The first reunion special featured guest appearances by Peter Mansbridge, Battle of the Blades winners Jamie Salé and Craig Simpson, and the Dragons of Dragons' Den. The special also featured the successor to the Chicken Cannon, the \\"F-Bombs,\\" which was dropped onto photographs from the top of the atrium of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. A further special aired on December 31, 2010, with Jessica Holmes reuniting with the rest of the cast. She would leave again, and not return to Air Farce until 2016. Roger Abbott died of leukemia on March 26, 2011. As December 31, 2011 fell on a Saturday, Hockey Night in Canada was broadcast as usual; the 2011 special, Air Farce Not The New Year's Eve Special aired instead on January 1, 2012. While the troupe had originally not planned to do a special for 2011-2012 due to the death of Roger Abbott, they were coaxed by producers and the CBC to continue. The special featured a new cast member, Arnold Pinnock, who became a regular member of the troupe, also featuring in their subsequent 2012/2013 New Year's Eve broadcast.http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/R/Royal_Canadian_Air_Farce/2011/12/12/19112866.html Pinnock elected not to return for the 2014 special. After a talent search, stand-up comic Aisha Alfa and Second City-alumni Darryl Hinds were added. The following year (2015), Park and Corrin left, and Emma Hunter was added to the cast. The year after that Holmes returned, bringing the cast back up to seven. In 2017 the Air Farce taped two specials; one for Canada Day in celebration of the 150th anniversary of Canada, the other was the troupe's traditional New Year's Eve show. While ratings for the specials remained strong, drawing over a million viewers in 2017 and 2018, the CBC informed the troupe in May 2019 that due to budgetary constraints, the 2019 year-end special would be the final edition in the series. Broadcast on December 30, 2019, the special included new topical material as well as highlights of the troupe's history, including tributes to deceased members John Morgan, Roger Abbott, and Dave Broadfoot.
