It tells the story of an Irish family whose son emigrated to America, via a series of letters sent from the father back in Kilkelly. It has five stanzas, covering the time period from 1860 to 1892. Background In the late 1970s or early 1980s Peter Jones discovered a collection of century- old letters in his parents' attic in Bethesda, Maryland. The letters had been sent by his great-great-great grandfather, Byran Hunt, to his son, Jones' great-great grandfather, John Hunt, who had emigrated from Kilkelly, County Mayo, to the United States in 1855 and worked on the railroad. As Byran was illiterate, the letters were dictated to the local schoolmaster, Pat McNamara (d. 1902), who often wrote letters on behalf of his neighbors who were unable to read and write. Covering the years 1858 to 1892, the Hunt letters shared family news of births, deaths, and marriages, and reports of the annual harvest. The last letter, dated February 1892, was written by John Hunt's brother, D. Hunt, informing him of the death of their father. Peter Jones decided to compose a ballad based on the contents of the letters. Description Presented as a series of letters, the ballad has five stanzas covering the time period from 1860 to 1892. The ballad conveys \\"the effects of poverty, famine and emigration on one Irish family\\" while also expressing the universal theme of the sadness and longing experienced by families who have been separated permanently by emigration. Covers \\"Kilkelly, Ireland\\" was first recorded on Fast Folk Musical Magazine (FF 207, September 1983) by Laura Burns and Roger Rosen in New York; a live version performed by an ensemble including Nikki Matheson, Jack Hardy, Robin Batteau and Richard Meyer at The Bottom Line in Greenwich Village was also released on Fast Folk in 1986 (FF 306 Live from the Bottom Line). It was subsequently recorded in Ireland by Danny Doyle on his album Twenty Years A-Growing (1987). The ballad appeared on the 1990s Irish music album Bringing It All Back Home. It has been covered by many artists, including Robbie O'Connell, Mick Moloney, Jimmy Keane, Atwater- Donnelly, Seamus Kennedy, The Dubliners, Se√°n Keane, Ciara Considine, Marc Gunn, and David Gans (with Eric Rawlins).

It has been a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 8th of December 2004.  Location  The fortress is located on the northeastern slopes of Majevica mountain in the villlage of Gornji Srebrenik, about 5 km away from the city centre. It is built on a steep, almost inaccessible rock, with a deep trench dug underneath, with the only entrance being a small bridge.  History  No current historical sources identify the exact year of its construction or who its constructor was. Earliest records date back to edicts of Stephen II to Ragusa from 1333. It was located on, at the time, important military roads which made it an important strategic stronghold. Already in 1363, king Louis I of Hungary sent an army to Bosnia, led by his palatine Nicholas Kont, which suffered significant losses under Srebrenik. In 1393 it was captured by Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxembourg and within the next decades it changed rulers several times, with Hungarians recapturing it in 1405, 1408 and 1410 respectively. It was then granted as a gift to Serbian despot Stefan Lazareviƒá, but remained in use by the Hungarians as a garrison. King Thomas of Bosnia managed to recapture it by 1433, but already in 1452 it was seized by ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, nephew of Stefan Lazareviƒá, who gave it to Hungarians. By 1462 the entire ≈æupa Usora was under Ottoman control, including Srebrenik. Due to failures in logistics and an epidemic, the Ottoman army had to retreat and Matthias Corvinus managed to seize back Srebrenik. In order to further improve defense against future Ottoman attacks, Matthias created banate of Srebrenik in 1464 and granted it to Nicholas of Ilok who later became the titular king of Bosnia. It is not known when the Ottomans recaptured it, but sometime between 1510 and 1519 is the most likely date. Ever since the Battle of Moh√°cs and up to Treaty of Karlowitz, due to expansion of Ottoman borders, the fortress saw very little military activity. Because of that, it was either completely abandoned or left with only a small garrison. In the 18th century, with Ottoman borders shrinking, it regained its strategic importance. Austrian spies reported it as an old fortress without providing any detailed descriptions. At this time, it was already in dire need of reparations. Some reparations were carried out as early as 1756, but their circumstances and results remain unreported. It finally ceased its use as a garrison in 1835 when the last soldier left it and was mostly abandoned ever after. The mosque, built by the Ottomans in early 16th century, was still maintained in the following years.

They consist of Luke Williams (vocals/guitar), Mathew Acreman (bass/backing vocals), Tyler Rhys (lead guitar/keyboards/vocals) and Steven Rodd (drums). Since their formation in 2003 in the Rhondda Valley, South Wales,http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales- news/merthyr/2007/01/25/it-s-a-miserable-life-91466-18530776/ the band have cemented a loyal local following and are renowned for their powerful and energetic live shows. Background The founding members, Luke Williams and Mathew Acreman were originally joined by drummer Mike Thompson and later by guitarist/keyboardist Matthew Harris. They gained popularity in south Wales following the release of their debut single, You Can Keep The Kids/Pianissimo in 2007. The band received positive reviews and were described as \\"‚Ä¶one of the best unsigned bands in the UK\\" (Claire Sturgess ‚Äì XFM).http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/band_profile.php?bandname=Donde%20Stars They played well-received sets at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Metro Weekender Cardiff in 2007, as well as receiving radio-play from BBC Wales and XFM, including a session for Adam Walton. Mike Thompson and Matthew Harris left the band in 2008 due to other commitments and so the band brought in local solo artist and film school graduate Tyler Rhys on guitar, and sound technician Steven Rodd on drums. Since the introduction of these new members the band has gone from strength to strength, with the song Bringer of the Dark being featured on BBC Introducing with Tom Robinson. The band since then have had a new drummer on board in the name of Guy Martinez. Guy had been frequenting the famous Rockfield studios in Monmouth as a session drummer for numerous bands and joined the rest of the band for their first official gig, which took place in Domodossola in Italy in January 2010 and the band gaining more high-profile shows including upcoming appearances at Square Festival, Aberystwyth and headline shows in Italy. The band The Donde Stars play grand and emotionally charged rock music which is notable for William's soaring and powerful vocals, Rhys' intricate lead guitar and the tight and heavy rhythm section of Harris and Rodd. Williams has until recently been the principal songwriter, and has written all the songs on the anticipated upcoming debut album. Tyler Rhys is also a songwriter, having previously released low-profile solo recordings, and the two have begun writing together for the band's second album. The band are fortunate in that the make up of the band, of two principal songwriters and two sound technicians, means that developing music can be done entirely in-house in a self-contained unit. Both Tyler Rhys and Guy Martinez are multi-instrumentalists and have been known to switch instruments for encores at shows. Bassist Harris owns his own practice and recording studio that the band have always at their disposal, and it will be re-decorated and used to demo their second album early next year. Releases The Donde Stars released their first single, the double A-side, \\"You Can Keep The Kids/Pianissimo\\" on Reacharound Records in March 2007.http://www.musicomh.com/singles/donde-stars_0307.htm It was recorded by Tim Lewis (formerly of Spiritualized) who has since been working with the band on their debut album, set for self-release on Antic Records in late 2009. Farewell, Tragic Lightning Boy is the proposed title of the album, which has been funded by the band and painstakingly put together over weekend trips to studios in Carmenthenshire. America will be the lead single off the album and will be available digitally. It was the first song to be recorded by the current line-up of the band and shows the intricate instrumentation the new members bring.

The tower of the first ch√¢teau, dated 1496, still stands, incorporated into later structures of the 17th century.Veronique Moreau, Le Ch√¢teau d'Azay-le-Ferron Pg. 4 In 1560, the chateau passed to the family of Louis I de Cravant, who owned it until the end of the 17th century. The owners included Cesar de Vend√¥me, son of King Henry IV of France and Gabrielle d'Estr√©es, who became Baron of Preuilly by royal decree, and Louis IV de Crevant, a Mar√©chal in the army of Louis XIV. A residence and a new wing and pavilion were added to the tower in 1638, probably by Louis III de Crevant d'Humieres, and windows were pierced in the old tower to transform the fortress into a residence.Moreau, pg, 6 This new wing was ornamented with the salamander emblem of King Fran√ßois I, and the ermine emblem of Claude de France. Topiary garden at Ch√¢teau d'Azay-le-Ferron, with trees shaped to resemble chess pieces In 1699, the baronnie Ch√¢teau d'Azay-le-Ferron was purchased by Louis-Nicolas Le Tonnelier de Breteuil. His daughter, Gabrielle- Emilie, was the mistress of Voltaire from 1733 until 1737. The de Breteuil family owned the chateau until 1739, when it was sold to Louis Fran√ßois de Gallifet. The de Bretueil family probably constructed the east wing of the building, which carries their coat of arms. After 1739, the estate passed to a long series of owners. Shortly after the Revolution, it was owned by two prominent manufacturers of weapons for the army of Napoleon. In 1852, it was purchased by Victor and Antoine Luzarche. They and their descendants owned the house through the rest of the 19th and early 20th century. The granddaughter of Antoine Luzarche, Marthe, married George Hersent, a civil engineer and owner of a large firm which built canals and ports, and inherited the ch√¢teau in 1925. When she died, she left the house and park to the city of Tours.  The Interior  Part of the French garden at Ch√¢teau d'Azay-le-Ferron The ch√¢teau is furnished as it was when occupied by the Luzarche family and George Hersant and his wife, between 1850 and 1953, when it opened to the public. On the ground floor, the small dining room has a buffet from the 18th century, and a collection of 18th-century still-life paintings. The Salle des Gardes contains a large collection of hunting trophies from Roger Luzarche d'Azay, including an enormous stuffed crocodile from his hunting trips to Africa in the late 19th century. The grand stairway to the first floor has an inscription on the wall noting that it was built by Jacques de Crevant, Baron of Preuilly, in 1638. The Salon Empire on the first floor has a notable collection of furniture and art from the period of the First French Empire collected by Gregoire Michel, a Paris banker and the owner of the house from 1803 to 1852. The bedroom of Madame Hersent has a notable Empire bed and furniture, and botanical painting by Jean-Fran√ßois Garneray (1775‚Äì1837). The Salon Resturation has a magnificent parquet floor in the form of a rose, taken from the private mansion in Versailles. The room was the bedroom of George Hersent. The Salle Cassas features a gallery of drawings made by Louis- Fran√ßois Cassas (1756‚Äì1827), who was born in the chateau, the godson of the Marquis de Gallifet, the owner at the time. From 1784 onwards, Cassas was in the company of the Count of Choiseul-Gouffier, the French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. He traveled throughout the Ottoman Empire and made drawings of the monuments of Turkey, Egypt and Syria. In 1816, he became the inspector of the royal manufactory of tapestries of Gobelins, which represents the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia which ended the Thirty Years' War.Moreau, pg. 23. The library features a large 16th-century tapestry, \\"L'Enlevement des Sabines,\\" from either Flanders or Paris, and the painting \\"L'Allegorie de la Paix, from 1641, by the Dutch artist Hendrick Martensz Sorgh (1611‚Äì1670). The bedroom of Madame Luzarche d'Azay is furnished in the Louis XVI style, with the original pink striped wallpaper from the period. The largest and most impressive room of the house, the Grand Salon, is located on the second floor. Its main features are an early 17th-century painted ceiling, brought from the same house in Versailles as the parquet floor of the Salon Restauration; and richly decorated chests and cabinets from the Italian Renaissance period. It displays three paintings by the Genoese artist Antonio Lagorio (1652‚Äì1690), and a painting of the Virgin and the Child by Simon Fran√ßois de Tours (1606‚Äì1671), believed to be an allegory about the birth of a child to Anne of Austria, the Regent of Louis XIV.Moreau, pg. 28 The large dining room, also on the second floor, has fine wood panelling from the 1930s, a marble fountain from Languedoc, a large Baccarat crystal chandelier, and Aubusson tapestries representing Louis XV hunting. The Salle Voltaire, furnished in the 18th century, recalls the romantic relationship between Voltaire and the daughter of Nicholas-Louis Le Tonnelier de Bretieul, owner of the chateau. The Salon de la Tour, on the lower level of the tower, the oldest part of the chateau, displays French Regency period commodes and portraits of the early owners of the chateau.  Park and gardens Ch√¢teau viewed from the park The original park was created in the 17th century, and had an area of fifty hectares, 10 hectares in a landscape park and the rest called a \\"parc agricole,\\" probably for raising fruits and vegetables. A few of the alignments of the early garden exist, and are carefully preserved.Veronique Moreau, pg. 8 In 1856 Antoine Luzarche commissioned the Buhler Brothers, landscape architects, to create a French landscape garden, with perspectives, alleys and bosquets of trees, covering an area of eighteen hectares. The new park included an arboretum of exotic trees, including Sequoia trees from California. Beginning in 1920, Georges Hersent added a classical garden √† la fran√ßaise, with broderies and topiary, near the house, integrated with the architecture. In 1995, the Fran√ßois Rabelais University in Tours created an orchard of pear and apple trees in one part of the park.

Less than one-fifth of the country's population are engaged in polygamy. Legality In Zimbabwean civil law, the Marriage Act of Zimbabwe only recognises monogamous marriages. However, the majority of marriages in Zimbabwe are customary; the relevant African Marriages Act of Zimbabwe recognises both polygamous and \\"potentially polygamous\\" unions. Moreover, most of these customary marriages are unregistered. Incidence Polygamy in Zimbabwe was traditionally practised by the tribal chiefs as a means of elevating their social standing, though they would typically only take two or three wives. According to a 2008 William & Mary Law School study, an estimated 18 percent of Zimbabwean women belong to polygamous marriages. The study suggested that there may be a decrease in the incidence of polygamy in Zimbabwe due to an ever-weakening economy that would not enable men to financially support multiple partners. Furthermore, polygamy in Zimbabwe has been criticised by various mainstream Christian groups that 80 percent of the country identify with. A separate 2008 study by the University of Fort Hare stated that polygamy was more prevalent in rural Zimbabwe and especially among the Shona people; it also argued that \\"polygamy ... seems to propagate child sexual abuse in schools because it sees no boundary between adults and children.\\" =Notable marriages= In September 2012, Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai customarily married Elizabeth Macheka, following a court ruling that he could not legally marry her in light of his already being engaged to two other women, Locardia Karimatsenga and Nosipho Regina Shilubane. However, a spokesperson for Tsvangirai said that the prime minister only wished to have one wife.

A single-volume condensed version was published at the end of the year by Ecco Press, an abridgment Vollmann explained by saying, \\"I did it for the money.\\" Representing over 20 years of work, Rising Up and Rising Down attempts to establish a moral calculus to consider the causes, effects, and ethics of violence. Much of it consists of Vollmann's own reporting from places wracked by violence, among them Cambodia, Somalia, and Iraq. The unabridged edition was only published in one limited run of 3,500 copies. Subject and method Rising Up and Rising Down is a wide-ranging study of the justifications for and consequences of violence. The seven-volume edition is divided between essays analyzing the actions and motivations of historical figures (including Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln, John Brown, Robespierre, Cort√©s, Trotsky, Stalin, and Gandhi) and pieces of journalism and reportage that act as contemporary \\"case studies\\" on the problem of violence. The first volume of the set is given over to the \\"Moral Calculus\\", Vollmann's attempt to outline rules for when and where violence is justified. Generally, Vollmann maintains that violence is justifiable only in cases of immediate self-defence and defense of innocents - on higher, politically organized levels, justifications of violence are likely to lead to the harm of innocents.Vollmann, William T.

Plot During the Second World War, a captured German spy (Marius Goring) is executed at the Tower of London, without revealing the whereabouts of Professor Hansen, a refugee Swedish scientist in Britain. He is believed to be unwittingly passing information on the atomic bomb to Germany through the neutral Irish Free State. British intelligence attempts to locate him and break this link.Film synopsis Two intelligence officers, Captain Grant and Captain Hunter, travel incognito on the overnight ferry to Dublin. They observe the German contact, Keitel, and their suspicion falls on lawyer Paul Faber. Grant manages to get a clerical job in Faber's London office, using a false identity. He allows himself to be exposed as an ex-army officer who's gone AWOL, and allows himself to be blackmailed by Faber into doing a number of illegal jobs. These include a marriage of convenience to Marion, a young Austrian girl who is desperate to acquire British nationality; also the theft of some radioactive items from a docks warehouse. Eventually, the trail leads Grant, Hunter and the police to a manor house on the coast of Devon, where Hansen is being hidden. Grant and Marion, now married, decide to stay together.

He was known for his studies on the uptake and distribution of inhalational anesthetics, as well for defining the various stages of general anesthesia. The guedel pattern airway is named after him. Early life and education Arthur Ernest Guedel was born on June 13, 1883 in Cambridge City, Indiana to Jahn and Mary Guedel. During his teens, he had an accident at work that amputated three fingers from his right hand. His family was unable to afford high school, so he taught himself and was admitted to the Indiana Medical College of Purdue at Indianapolis, which would later become Indiana University School of Medicine, in 1903. He graduated in 1908 with first honors and began his internship at Indianapolis City Hospital. World War I Guedel served as First Lieutenant (and later Captain) in the U.S. Army from 1917-1919. During his time, he worked at the American Expeditionary Forces hospitals in Chaumont and Vittels, France. Guedel was responsible for overseeing up to six hospitals at one time. For this reason, he became known as the \\"motorcycle anesthetist\\" because he would travel to the various hospitals by motorcycle. Guedel taught various medical personnel, from nurses to orderlies, how to manage anesthesia, Because of this, he defined the stages of anesthesia, now known as Guedel's classification. Dunked dog experiment In the 1920s, Guedel began experimenting with how to make a cuffed endotracheal airway. He corresponded greatly with his colleague and friend, Dr Ralph M. Waters about inventing a cuffed endotracheal tube. In 1928, Guedel and Waters did the \\"dunked dog experiment\\" on Guedel's family dog. In the experiment, the dog was sedated and intubated using Guedel's cuffed airway. To show how well the cuffed airway worked, the dog was dunked underwater for one hour. Following this, the dog was taken out of the tank and took a nap on the floor. The dog later lived with Waters and his family in Wisconsin. Personal life Guedel married Florence Fulton in 1909. They had two children: Marian (b. 1912) and Gretchen (1915-1940). Guedel died in California in 1956 at the age of 72.

He has been visiting professor at the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. Garfield worked with health authorities in Central America in malaria control, where wars during the 1980s stymied disease control efforts. He helped reorganize health services to protect civilians from the impact of conflict. In the 1980s and 1990s Garfield quantified the impact of conflict on noncombatants using epidemiologic methods and studied the effects of economic sanctions on health in Iraq, Cuba, Nicaragua, Liberia, Haiti, and the former Yugoslavia. He is known for estimates of mortality changes related to conflict. On Iraq, Gulf War and UN sanctions against Iraq. Journalist Matt Welch praised Garfield's work on this controversial subject: > Those who get past the initial frustrations of researching [ Iraq sanctions > ] usually end up on Richard Garfield's doorstep. His 1999 report ... picked > apart the faulty methodologies of his predecessors, criticized the bogus > claims of the anti-sanctions left, admitted when the data were shaky, and > generally used conservative numbers. Among his many interesting findings was > that every sanctions regime except the one imposed on apartheid South Africa > led to limitations of food and medicine imports, even though such goods were > almost always officially exempt from the embargo. \\"In many countries,\\" he > wrote, \\"the embargo-related lack of capital was more important than direct > restrictions on importing medicine or food.\\" Welch reported his updated conclusion: > Between August, 1991, and March, 1998, there were between 106,000 and > 227,000 excess deaths of children under five.

In September 2009, a judge ordered von Brunn to undergo a competency evaluation to determine whether or not he could stand trial. On January 6, 2010, von Brunn died of natural causes while awaiting trial. Von Brunn was a white supremacist, Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi. He had previously been convicted of entering a federal building with various weapons in 1981 while trying to place the members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who he considered to be treasonous, under citizen's arrest. Background The Holocaust Museum has been a target for antisemites and Holocaust deniers since it was established in 1993. In 2002, federal prosecutors said two white supremacists plotted to blow up the museum with a fertilizer bomb, as was used to blow up a federal building in Oklahoma in 1995. Shooting At about 12:49 p.m., 88-year-old James von Brunn drove his car to the 14th Street entrance of the museum. Von Brunn entered the museum when Museum Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns opened the door for him. Authorities said he raised a Winchester Model 1906 .22-caliber rifle and shot Special Police Officer Johns once in the upper torso, who later died of his injuries at the George Washington University Hospital. Two other Special Police Officers stationed with Officer Johns, Harry Weeks and Jason \\"Mac\\" McCuiston, then exchanged fire with von Brunn, wounding him with a shot to the face. According to police officers at the scene, a third person was injured by broken glass but refused treatment at the hospital. In total, 11 shots were fired during the incident (three from von Brunn and eight from Weeks and McCuiston).https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-2009-06-12-0906110718-story.html =Immediate aftermath= A sign honoring Stephen Tyrone Johns, the Special Police Officer shot and killed during the shooting, located in the museum's lobby. The Washington Post reported that \\"if it weren't for the quick response of the private guards on duty, more people could have been killed or wounded.\\" Mayor Adrian Fenty stated that the officers' efforts \\"to bring this gunman down so quickly ... saved the lives of countless people... This could have been much, much worse.\\" Inside, the museum was crowded with visiting schoolchildren. Museum officials said that \\"the entire incident unfolded in approximately two minutes.\\" After the shooting, the nearby U.S. Department of Agriculture Administration Building, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the USDA's Sidney R. Yates Federal Building were closed. Portions of 14th Street and Independence Avenue in the Southwest quadrant were closed until later in the night. The car driven by von Brunn was found double parked in front of the museum and tested for explosives. Police said they found a notebook on von Brunn that contained a list of District locations, including the Washington National Cathedral; they dispatched bomb squads to at least 10 sites. The notebook also contained this passage, signed by von Brunn: \\"You want my weapons‚Äîthis is how you'll get them. The Holocaust is a lie. Obama was created by Jews. Obama does what his Jew owners tell him to do. Jews captured America's money. Jews control the mass media. The 1st Amendment is abrogated henceforth.\\" The FBI and Washington, D.C. police chief Cathy L. Lanier said that it appeared von Brunn was acting alone at the time of the shooting, and the FBI said it had no knowledge of any threat against the museum. The museum's director of security said they receive threats, but \\"nothing this significant recently\\". =Possible motives= Several news agencies have noted the timing of the June 10 shooting; it came shortly after Obama's June 5 visit to and speech at the Buchenwald concentration camp, and that \\"President Obama‚Äôs recent visit to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp, in Germany, may have set off the shooter.\\" On his website, von Brunn stated that his conviction in the 1980s was by \\"a Negro jury, Jew/Negro attorneys\\" and that he was \\"sentenced to prison for eleven years by a Jew judge.\\" A Court of Appeals denied his appeal. Victim Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns (October 4, 1969 ‚Äì June 10, 2009), a Temple Hills, Maryland native, was an employee of Wackenhut who was, at the time of the shooting, stationed at the door of the museum when von Brunn entered with a .22 caliber long rifle and shot him. He later died at the George Washington University Hospital. His funeral was held on June 19, 2009 at Ebenezer AME Church in Fort Washington, Maryland, with 2,000 attendees, and he was subsequently interred. Johns was married to Zakiah Johns (since May 2008) with a son, Stephen Johns, Jr., and two stepsons, Jeffrey Pollard and Tysean Lawson-Bey. The American Jewish Committee established a memorial fund for the family. Perpetrator James W. von Brunn died in prison while awaiting trial on January 6, 2010. He was in poor health and suffered from congestive heart failure and sepsis. Following his death, the Washington Post notes: \\"His guilt was never in serious doubt -- the shooting was witnessed by dozens of people, it was captured on surveillance video and the assailant was carted away in an ambulance -- but some had hoped to glean some insights into von Brunn's psyche during the court process. Many, including Johns's relatives, remain shocked that anyone could be filled with so much hatred that he would shoot a helpful security guard at a museum that serves as a memorial to the slaughter of millions of people.\\" Witnesses and events at the museum Present at the museum during the shooting was former United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen, awaiting his wife Janet Langhart; the two were at the museum for the premiere of Langhart's one-act play, Anne and Emmett. The play imagines a conversation between two teenagers, Nazi victim Anne Frank and Jim Crow victim Emmett Till. Her play was to be presented in honor of the eightieth anniversary of Anne Frank's birth. Reaction The day after the shooting, the Holocaust Museum's flag flew at half-staff in memory of the murdered guard, Stephen Tyrone Johns. The Israeli embassy in Washington condemned the attack. U.S. President Barack Obama said, \\"This outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and FBI stated they had been monitoring von Brunn's Internet postings, but were unable to take action because his comments had not crossed the line from free speech into illegal threats or incitement. On June 11, 2009, the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington and the InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington led a prayer vigil which took place in front of the museum to honor Stephen Johns, the slain officer. Approximately 100 people attended the event, including officials from the Israeli and German embassies. The Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the attack as well. When the museum reopened on June 12, 2009, Director Sara Bloomfield said attendance was normal or even higher than usual. Many visitors said their attendance was a statement against hate and intolerance. A 17-year-old girl who was in the museum the day of the shooting stated, \\"It's important to come back, because if you don't, they win. It's a form of terrorism.\\" On the white nationalist Internet forum Stormfront, some users criticized von Brunn's actions, saying they hurt the forum's cause. Others supported him in threads that were later removed some of which later reappeared.

The screenplay concerns a leading brain surgeon who murders a woman he believes to be responsible for the death of the woman he loved. It was made at Gainsborough Pictures' Islington Studios, with sets designed by the art director Andrew Mazzei. It was made as an independent production overseen by Sydney Box, then head of Gainsborough. Plot A medical school class attends a lecture on the psychology of crime. The unnamed lecturer (James Mason) announces that, while his past lectures have covered criminals with abnormal psychology, today's lecture will focus on the ‚Äúsane criminal\\" who may have a \\"strong sense of justice\\". He then describes the case of a murderer who is a \\"perfectly sane, valuable member of society\\", a surgeon to whom he gives the fictitious name of \\"Michael Joyce\\" (also played by Mason). The film depicts Michael's story in flashbacks narrated by the lecturer, indicating to the film viewing audience that, unbeknown to the medical school students, the lecturer is telling his own story and that he and Michael are one and the same. Michael is a skilled London surgeon and brain specialist with an established Harley Street practice. He is unhappily married and separated from his wife, has no close friends, and spends most of his time working. He meets Emma Wright (Rosamund John) when she brings her young daughter Ann (Ann Stephens), who is going blind, for a consultation. Michael performs a delicate operation to save Ann's sight. During Ann's treatment and recovery, Michael and Emma, whose husband is away on business travel, fall in love and have an affair, although neither is free to marry. Emma finally ends the affair and tells Michael they must never see each other again. Soon afterwards Michael learns that Emma has died from a broken neck after falling from her bedroom window at her country home. Michael attends the inquest, at which both Ann and Kate Howard, Emma's sister-in-law (Pamela Kellino), testify. Emma's death is ruled an accident, but Michael is suspicious and conducts his own investigation. In order to gather information he romances Kate, who proves to be a greedy, shallow woman with debt problems and a grudge against her brother and Emma because her brother had inherited most of her parents' estate. Kate tells Michael that she knew Emma had a lover, but did not know who it was. After speaking privately with the caretaker of Emma's house and with Ann, Michael concludes that Kate had tried to blackmail Emma by threatening to tell her husband and daughter about her affair. Emma, who had already ended the affair, refused to give Kate money, so Kate told Ann about the affair. Ann's upset reaction then drove her mother to commit suicide by jumping from her bedroom window. Michael, repulsed by Kate, tries to break up with her without telling her what he knows, but she insists she wants to be with him. So, on the pretext of them taking a romantic trip together, he lures Kate to Emma's former house on a night when he knows the caretaker will be away, and after a violent struggle kills her by pushing her out the same window. After recounting this story, the lecturer dismisses the class, reiterating in response to a student's question that the murderer was \\"perfectly sane - sane as I am\\". He then drives off campus and picks up a woman with luggage (also played by Pamela Kellino), thus confirming to the viewers that the story of \\"Michael Joyce\\" was really about him, but showing that he has not yet killed the woman he called \\"Kate Howard\\" in his lecture. He now begins to carry out the murder plan as described, luring her to the house and then revealing that he was her sister-in-law's lover. However, when he tries to push her out the window, she fights him, forcing him to choke her and thus leave evidence of a struggle. She drops the key out the window and finally falls out, causing him to have to force the lock open to exit the room. Realising that he has left too much evidence, he moves her dead body to the back seat of his car and drives away, narrowly escaping being caught by the caretaker who has unexpectedly returned. The murderer then drives through dense fog with the body hidden in the back seat of his car, eventually encountering a local general practitioner, Dr Farrell, whose car has broken down. Despite his fear that Farrell will discover the body in the car, the murderer reluctantly gives Farrell a ride after learning that he is hurrying to see a critically ill patient, a young girl who has suffered a head injury as a result of a road accident. He reveals to Farrell that he is also a doctor and that he has emotional feelings about his patients, never liking to lose a patient but also wishing that, instead of having to impartially provide medical care, he could sit in judgment and decide which patients live and which die. By contrast, Farrell is a cynic who freely admits he loses many patients and doesn't care whether they live or die, only going through the motions of expressing sympathy to the families of the deceased. Farrell is planning to tell the injured girl's mother that there is no hope of her recovery, and asks the murderer to come in with him to provide support for that opinion. However, after seeing the patient, the murderer decides to operate and performs a complicated brain surgery in the girl's bedroom. Midway through the operation, the murderer sends Farrell to get a needed medical item from his car, forgetting that Farrell will likely see the body in the car. Farrell searches through the car to find the item and the film suggests that he sees the body, but chooses not to interrupt the operation, allowing the patient's life to be saved. Afterwards, Farrell congratulates the murderer on a good operation, but also diagnoses him as \\"paranoid\\" and \\"mad\\" based on his statements about judging who should live and who should die. The murderer leaves, with his victim's body still in his car, and drives to Beachy Head, where, disturbed by the realisation that he is not sane, he commits suicide by jumping off the cliff.

Mason and his then wife, Pamela Kellino (Mason), had originally planned to develop a film on the Bront√´ family entitled The Upturned Glass, written by Pamela and starring James as Branwell Bront√´. They dropped the idea after learning of the Hollywood production Devotion, and instead developed a psychological thriller under the same title, in which both Masons would play leading roles. The film was based on a story by American serviceman Jno. P. Monaghan, whom the Masons had befriended when touring the US for the American Red Cross. Kellino and Monaghan worked on the story together, and Monaghan appeared in a small role as an American military truck driver. In the original draft of the script, Mason was to play a detective and the film was to focus around a school mistress. However after Mason was unable to secure the services of the actors they wanted, Celia Johnson and Phyllis Calvert, the script was rewritten. The new script had nothing to do with an upturned glass but they decided to keep the title because it had received considerable publicity.FROM LONDON'S STUDIOS: Back-Seat Driving-British Style By C.A. LEJEUNE. New York Times 21 July 1946: X3. James Mason co-produced the film with Sydney Box, with whom he had previously worked on the Academy-Award-winning The Seventh Veil. For his work on The Upturned Glass, Mason, who at the time had \\"enormous drawing power\\", received the equivalent of $240,000 in U.S. dollars, plus a percentage of the profits. The project was announced in February 1946 with the co stars originally to be Kellino, Rosamund John and Robert Newton. It was to follow production of Odd Man Out. Mason was doing the film under his contract with Rank, having turned down Hungry Hill. Filming began at Riverside Studio in June 1946. Mason made it just before leaving for the US. In March 1947 J Arthur Rank sent editor Allan Obiston to the USA for Mason's thoughts on the cut.A SHIVERING LONDON LOOKS AT THE MOVIES: Cold Cuts Theatre Attendance and Slows Production, but Planning Still Goes On By C.A.

Situated in the northern foothills of the Troodos Mountains, 26 km southwest of Nicosia. The area was inhabited from the Late Bronze Age, by Arcadocypriot Greek settlershttp://theseus- aegean.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/blog-post_29.html  History  Klirou was an integral part of Ancient Tamassos Kingdom as it was a copper production district, dotted with hundreds of mines and dozens of smelting - furnace sites. According to Strabohttp://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/2331/135.html the Tamasos kingdom had silver mines at the Kouloupas area. During Roman times, the mining industry in Cyprus was run by the Procurator (Roman). From the 2nd to 5th century Klirou village wasn't the village it is today, but rather a complex of more than ten villages with a mixed population of mostly Greeks and Jews within the districts. In the centre of Klirou was a 3 kilometer long underground water supply tunnel and two large water storage units, on the site known as ŒõŒØŒºŒΩŒÆ (lake). There is evidence of ancient burial pits containing many skulls, which could indicate mass war graves dating back to Roman times. Some sources say that the Jewish villages were abandoned or destroyed during the Kitos War. It appears that its name was taken during the period of transition to Christianity, from the clerics accompanying the Roman army and stationed in Klirou in 390 A.D. preaching Christianity, and observing anti- pagan laws. During that period all people living in the area had to go to Klirou and declare themselves as Christians in order to have rights in court law, property, and possessions. As they use to say \\"we are going to the see the clerics\\" (ŒöŒªŒ∑œÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœÖœÇ). Hence the name Klirou came into existence. According to the local version of myth, at around (650 - 700 A.D.). A military unit of Arabs, with the mission to conquer Pitsilia, had been decimated by a severe hail storm in the area Klirou - Fikardou. The commander and a few soldiers sought refuge in the small chapel of Lachni. The officer sensed the connection of the storm with the sanctity of the place and made a vow to rebuild the chapel, if the storm calms, which was done. The same source reports that this military officer, although he was later promoted to an adviser of the Umayyad Caliphate in Syria, rebuilt and often visited the chapel. At the Frankishhttp://kypros.org/Sxetikos/Library/ByzantineChurches/AHistoryofCyprus-5.htm (Lusignan Dynasty) (1200-1490) Klirou was Montolipho's family fiefdom. Amongst (1294-1310) Simon de Montolipho https://archive.org/stream/chroniquedelle00bustuoft#page/196/mode/2up was one of the leaders of the Templars in Cyprus. In 1308 the Pope ordered the arrest of all Templars,Anne Gilmour-Bryson.

Amalric, Prince of Tyre was ruling Cyprus at the time and had overthrown his brother Henry II of Jerusalem (and Cyprus), with the help of the Templars. The Templars blamed Amalric for the arrests and commissioned Simon for the job. Simon manned his team with trusted men from Klirou and dressed as stable servants, ambushed the regency in the village of Pentageia disarming his guards. Simon beheaded the regency in a duel and removed his royal necklace. Simon's accomplices demanded the regency's ring and Simon de Montolipho cut the right hand of Amalric and they took it with them.

It was founded in 1802 by a Colonel Cecil C. Clay, a former US Army Brigadier-General from Philadelphia. Colonel Clay recognized the natural resources in the large stands of virgin white pine and red spruce in Pocahontas County, which today involves enormous portions of the Monongahela National Forest. At this point in history, loggers calculated that these massive forests would have time to replenish themselves by the time they cut from one side of the wilderness to the other. White pine was an extremely useful wood. It was light, versatile, and capable of supplying many different needs in paper, furniture, and household materials. An enterprising logger could purchase a stand of promising forest, erect his own mill, cut and process the logs and float them down the river. Sawmill towns mushroomed in West Virginia and especially in its Eastern Panhandle. The St. Lawrence Boom and Lumber Company brought the first log drive down the Greenbrier River and soon erected \\"The Big Mill\\" out of the choicest timbers. From this beginning emerged the largest softwood mill in the country. Over time, much of the Greenbrier River was harnessed for this form of heavy water-traffic. The river was sculpted with dams, spills, holding areas for the timbers, eyots to control the speed of the flow, cribs, water-pockets and sluiceways. Storage was needed for the millions of logs cut from Pocahontas and upper Greenbrier counties. As BJ Gudmundsson of Patchwork Films reported: > The Greenbrier River was harnessed at Ronceverte with dams, cribs, booms, > pockets and equipment to receive and store the endless millions of logs cut > from the mountains of upper Greenbrier and Pocahontas sections and floated > down to feed the ravenous and unending whirling buzzing saws. They had a > capacity of 110,000 board feet per day. '' In 24 years the company sawed of white pine.Clarkson, Roy B. \\"Tumult on the Mountains: Lumbering in West Virginia--1770-1920. McClain Printing Company Parson, WV 1964 P. 10 Lumberjacks worked with giant log arks long and special logging bateau that were tough and quick. A single error could spell disaster, and the work could be very dangerous. Springtime floods were vital in order to float down this large amount of timber, and high water meant industry rather than inconvenience to the citizens of Ronceverte. However, the initial calculations that the forests would 'last forever' ended with the incoming superiority of the railroad. Tracklines were created, such as the Durbin & Greenbrier Valley Railroad.http://www.pocahontascountywv.com/durbin_greenbrier_valley_railroad.aspx The trains could haul the trees out of the forests much faster than the river could float them down. The days of the rivermen were at an end. On Saint Patrick's Day of 1908, the Greenbrier River witnessed its last log run. Pocahontas Times editor Cal Price explained in an interview by West Virginia film maker, BJ Gudmundsson for Patchwork Films, how everyone stopped what they were doing to watch the logs float down the Greenbrier River for the last time. They knew it was the end of an era. In 1911, the Weeks Act was passed, ensuring the protection of large portions of land from logging in the Monongahela National Forest. This Forest remains a large supply of clean drinking water for many watersheds. In 1915 the first were purchased.

The station began broadcasting in 1939 as KVAN, but after it changed formats to Top 40 and became KISN in 1959, KISN became not only the number one rated rock station in the market (the station followed a Top 50 playlist),web.etk.edu/gallant/radio-surveys/kisn.html -selected KISN Top 50 surveys from 1966‚Äì1970 but at times the most popular radio station in Portland. In 1976, the FCC revoked KISN's license and others owned by the Star Stations group due to a series of indiscretions involving connections to candidates for the United States Senate in Indiana and Oregon. The KISN name has been reused several times for oldies radio stations in the Portland area, including a currently operating low-power FM radio station. History =KVAN= KVAN signed on in November 1939. It operated on 880 kHz and was built by Sheldon F. Sackett, who promptly sold a majority share in the new outlet to its first manager, Walter L. Read. The station initially broadcast with 250 watts during the day only; it changed frequencies to 910 kHz in 1941 when NARBA took effect. Read retired in 1940, and Sackett bought back the shares; the next year, KVAN was authorized for a power increase to 500 watts. Two years later, Sackett filed to move KVAN to 930 kHz and broadcast at night for the first time, but this was denied by the FCC. Instead, three years later, the commission allowed the station to broadcast with 1,000 watts day and night. The station stayed on the air during the 1948 flood of the Columbia River by hoisting its transmitter to the ceiling. While KVAN's studios were in Vancouver, the transmitter had been moved to the Oregon side of the state line after going to 1,000 watts in 1947. For the station, that posed a regulatory problem. Despite being a Washington company running a station licensed to Washington, when the station took advertising from a Washington brewery, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission claimed jurisdiction over the station because the transmitter was in Oregon. At the time, state law did not allow liquor advertising before 10 p.m., and that prompted the station to lose the advertiser. By the early 1950s, KVAN aired a country and western format; Willie Nelson was one of the DJs. He financed his own first single, \\"No Place for Me\\"; the record was backed with \\"Lumberjack\\" written by Leon Payne, who was also a DJ at the station. KVAN planned for a venture into television in the early 1950s. In 1952, it filed an application for the channel 21 allocation to Portland opposite the one made by Mt. Scott Telecasters, owners of KGON (1520 AM). KVAN prevailed, and though Sackett predicted that KVAN-TV would go on the air January 15, 1954, it did not. In 1955, Sackett announced he would open a new tabloid newspaper in Portland to complement KVAN-AM-TV; by this point, the station was allowed to originate 51 percent of its programming from its Portland transmitter. The tabloid did not materialize, either; by late 1956, KVAN was engaged in a fight to move the channel 2 allocation from Portland across the Columbia River in an attempt to move from UHF to VHF. =Sale to Star Stations= In 1959, Sackett sold KVAN to the Star Stations, which was headed by Don W. Burden and owned stations in Omaha, Denver and Pocatello, Idaho, for $580,000. For Sackett, the sale of KVAN was about focusing on the newspaper business; at the same time, he sold another holding, KROW in Oakland, California, to Gordon McLendon. Burden wasted no time changing everything at KVAN. After 24 hours of playing \\"terrible music\\" and asking listeners, \\"Do you want a revolution?\\", KVAN became Top 40 station KISN on May 1 with a $40,000 promotion blitz and plans to move the entire studio setup to Portland; later that year, the \\"KISN Corner\\" opened at 10th and West Burnside streets, featuring a street-level studio where passersby could look in. KISN was Portland's first Top 40 station, and it was an immediate success, finishing first in the ratings in 1960. During one rating book in 1963, the station held 86 percent of the audience. However, it was still licensed to Vancouver, and its attempts to identify as a Portland station resulted in an FCC fine of $2,000 in 1962. Three years later, the commission ordered the station to cease and desist from linking itself to Portland on its air and fined the station $20,000. In January 1966, KISN was allowed to increase power to 5,000 watts and relocate its transmitter site to 4615 NE 158th Avenue, east of the Portland International Airport with power increased to 5,000 directional watts. Star also filed that year for an FM station on 103.3 FM in Portland. Several stars passed through KISN in its Top 40 years, including \\"The Real\\" Don Steele, who came to KISN from KOIL. =Renewal fight and closure= While KISN had problems with its station identification, they were of lesser magnitude than the problems that had led to WIFE in Indianapolis being granted a series of short-term renewals, the last being a six-month probationary renewal in 1969. On December 2, 1970, after a nine-month internal review, the FCC put all five Star Stations' license renewals up for hearing in a consolidated proceeding with an application to start a new station on WIFE's frequency. The commission would cover 22 issues in the hearing, including charges of illegal gifts of air time and coverage to Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana during his 1964 reelection campaign and a contribution to Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon in 1966 and directed the Star stations in those markets to promote those candidates. One issue struck at the heart of political corruption: according to the order, on the day in 1966 that county commissioners in Multnomah County, Oregon, overrode the planning commission to approve a new KISN transmitter site, Burden asked an employee to send him $10,000, in $100 bills, for the purpose of contributing to the commissioners that had supported the measure. Rounding out the order were additional questions over harassment of former employees, supervision of on-air contests, and lack of candor with the FCC. After multiple years of conflicting rulings, on January 31, 1975, the FCC voted 5‚Äì1 against the Star Stations on all counts, denying all five license renewals. Burden's appeals to federal court were rejected, and the FCC ordered all Star Stations to cease broadcasting on September 2. After evening air personality Dave \\"Records\\" Stone said \\"Good night from the KISN Good Guys\\", the station was not even allowed to complete its last song, the Supremes \\"Someday We'll Be Together\\", going silent at 12:01 a.m.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6eQcMtRVIM 910 kHz after KISN After the FCC revoked the KISN license, four applications were received for the vacated frequency, from Rose Broadcasting, Viking Vancouver, Fort Vancouver Broadcasting and Longwood Broadcasting; the agency designated these applications for comparative hearing on July 12, 1978. The applicants merged in 1979 under the Fort Vancouver Broadcasting application, enabling the FCC to issue a construction permit. The new station took the call letters KKSN‚Äîthe KISN calls having been assigned to 97.1 FM in Salt Lake City, Utah, on May 8, 1978‚Äî and began broadcasting April 1, 1980, trading on the \\"Mighty 91\\" name and KISN heritage. Former KISN sales manager Bill Failing served as the first general manager of the new KKSN. Revivals of KISN in Portland =\\"97.1 KISN-FM\\"= In 1988, then-KKLI 97.1, licensed to Portland, Oregon, became KKSN-FM and started broadcasting golden oldies with the same \\"kissin'\\" pronunciation of the station name. Dave \\"Records\\" Stone, the last of the original KISN disc jockeys, broadcast a Saturday specialty oldies program that included air checks from the original station plus unlimited presentations of \\"forgotten 45s\\" by his friend and assistant, Dirty Dave the Record Slave. The FM station (now KYCH-FM) changed to an adult hits format in 2005. The oldies format would return to the AM station until its final demise in 2007. The last moments of Stone's original 1976 farewell - \\"Good Night, from the KISN Good Guys!\\" - was used to close this station. =Internet revival project= In Spring 2009, surviving staff members celebrated 50 years since KISN first went on the air. Stone (also known as Dave Rogaway) would continue to document KISN and Portland history through his Web site, \\"The Stumptown Blogger\\". On January 1, 2010, Stone announced plans to revive KISN. His efforts and those of good friend \\"Dirty Dave the Record Slave,\\" station historian Craig Adams, and technician Scott Young would lead to KISN returning as an online audio stream. Officially titled the \\"KISN Good Guys\\" and located at http://goodguyradio.com/, the new KISN featured the voices of some of the original station's more popular personalities. The stream began operation at 7:00 p.m. PST on February 24, 2012. The \\"oldies\\" format featured the record collection of \\"Dirty Dave,\\" said to number over 100,000. As was noted throughout the broadcast day, the stream did not follow a limited playlist. Within weeks, the revived \\"KISN\\" had accumulated thousands of listeners not just in the Vancouver/Portland market, but had gained listeners from all over the world. On August 14, 2014, the project was officially discontinued, though the stream continued operating for several days afterward.\\"KISN Goodguys\\", feedback.pdxradio.com archive\\"KISN Goodguys\\", feedback.pdxradio.com archive =Low-power FM revival= Following the discontinued operation of the KISN internet stream, Scott Young contacted Ken Seymour of the Western Oregon Radio Club (WORC) to explore opportunities for joining forces to resurrect KISN radio. The WORC recently received a Construction Permit issued by the FCC to build a new low-power, non-commercial radio station assigned to Portland on 95.1 FM. The WORC, led by President Ron Polluconi and club member Ken Seymour, were planning to move the club's existing radio station, KQSO-LP, from Newberg, Oregon to Portland's Mount Scott. On August 26, 2014, the WORC installed the transmit antenna for 95.1 on a tower located in a communications compound on Mt. Scott. On October 21, 2014, Ken Seymour successfully negotiated use of the KISN call sign from the licensee of the current KISN radio station located near Bozeman, Montana. Subsequently, a press release was issued on November 28, 2014 where Ron Polluconi announced that \\"finally after 38 years the KISN call sign and radio signal will return to Portland via the FM airwaves\\". On May 1, 2015, at 9:51 a.m. KISN-LP commenced broadcasting 24 hours a day 56 years later to the day when the original KISN launched in 1959. KISN DJ's include Tom Brooks (G.

The route is designed to act as a link between the Capital Ring and the London Loop, and between the many green spaces and wildlife corridors along the way. It is approximately long. It mainly follows the Dollis Brook, and is one of the many parks and open spaces in Barnet. History Dollis Valley Greenwalk is based on the Brookside Walk, built by Finchley Council (now part of Barnet) in the 1930s.Following the Brent quotes a letter of complaint about the construction work in 1937. It was the brainchild of leading Finchley Councillor, Alfred Pike, and followed Mutton Brook west from Falloden Way to its junction with Dollis Brook, and then the Dollis north to the Finchley boundary in Wyatts Farm Open Space, opposite Walfield Avenue. Mutton Brook was the southern boundary of the borough and Dollis Brook the western one, and the walk was almost all built on the Finchley side. At Westbury Road, the gardens come down to the brook, so Pike persuaded Hendon Councillors to acquire the land on their side of the brook so that the walk could cross over to the Hendon side for this stretch.Reminiscence of Alfred Pike in Percy Reboul compiler, Barnet Voices, Tempus 1999, p. 25. The Greenwalk itself was developed by the London Borough of Barnet with the Countryside Commission (now Natural England) and the Countryside Management Service. In March 2009, the Dollis Valley Greenwalk won a ¬£400,000 grant from the Mayor of London's Help a London park scheme by public vote. The grant was planned to be used to improve footpaths, cycle paths, lighting, entrances for safer walking, accessibility, which includes making it a safe route for walking between communities, and play facilities. It was also used for improvement of existing habitats and creation of new ones such as wetland woodland and reedbed, enhancement of hay meadows, landscaping, and finally the addition of information boards, finger posts and other features to increase enjoyability and awareness of points of interest. Route Starting at the northern end, the route commences in Moat Mount Open Space.The Greenwalk follows the same route as the London Loop between Moat Mount and Barnet Lane, and the London Loop 16 guide gives instructions for following this part of the Greenwalk It then skirts Barnet Gate Wood, and goes through Totteridge Fields nature reserve, and by fields and public open spaces through Totteridge, Whetstone and Woodside Park. It passes under Dollis Brook Viaduct and through Windsor Open Space, and on to the end of Dollis Brook where it merges with Mutton Brook to become the River Brent. It then follows Mutton Brook and goes through Little Wood and Big Wood, ending at Hampstead Heath Extension in Hampstead Garden Suburb. The waymarks consist mostly of a simple a green disc with a directional white arrow mounted on a wooden post. From Woodside Park south, the walk is mainly flat and partly surfaced, and is thought to be suitable for wheelchair users and pushchairs, but some sections between Woodside Park and Mill Hill can get very muddy and walking shoes may be advisable. The southern end starts on the edge of Hampstead Heath Extension at the end of a short pathway from Meadway Close, Hampstead Garden Suburb. It goes along Meadway Close and Bigwood Road to Big Wood and Denman Drive South. It then goes through Little Wood Nature Reserve to Addison Way. It turns left along Addison Way and right into a path opposite Erskine Hill. It follows Mutton Brook across Finchley Road at Henlys Corner and under North Circular Road, and turns right where Mutton Brook meets Dollis Brook near Bridge Lane. From here it follows Dollis Brook under Hendon Lane to Windsor Open Space. It crosses Waverley Grove to leave Windsor Open Space at Thornfield Avenue. It then turns right along Dollis Road under Dollis Brook Viaduct, and left to follow the brook to Fursby Avenue and through Riverside Walk to Argyle Road. In the next section, the route turns right to a footbridge across the brook and then turns left along Holden Road, left again down Tillingham Way and then right to rejoin Dollis Brook in Laurel Way Open Space. It crosses Laurel Way and then goes through the meadowland and trees of Whetstone Stray to Totteridge Lane. It turns right along the Lane and then left just before Totteridge and Whetstone Underground station. This is the only place on the route with shops and toilets. The route continues through Brook Farm Open Space and Wyatts Farm Open Space to Western Way, and then through Barnet Playing Fields to Barnet Lane and Dollis Brook Walk. It then keeps to the right of the brook through Ducks Island until a narrow metal bridge. It crosses the bridge and turns right through fields for 1000 yards (leaving Dollis Brook, which now goes through private land) until it reaches a playing field, which is exited by a gap in the hedge on the left, It then goes through Totteridge Fields (a nature reserve which is a Site of Metropolitan Importance run by London Wildlife Trust) to Hendon Wood Lane. It turns right along Hendon Wood Lane and after about 500 yards continues along a path on the left, which skirts Barnet Gate Wood. At the end of the Wood the path bears left between hedges. A small pond on the right with a pipe under the path to a stream, which is often dry, is one of the sources of the Dollis Brook. The path then goes through fields to Moat Mount Local Nature Reserve. (When a route marker points half left off the main track, the path goes through the kissing gate opposite.) The route then goes through fields and a wood to wooden steps, where it turns right, finishing at the nature reserve's closed car park on the east side of Barnet Way, part of the A1, and a dual carriageway with no access from the northbound lane.

He was the son of Ulick na gCeann Burke, 1st Earl of Clanricarde and Grace O'Carroll. He married: 1) Margaret O'Brien, daughter of Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond and Eleanor FitzGerald, before 6 October 1548; 2) Margaret O'Brien, daughter of Donough O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Thomond and Helen Butler, on 24 November 1553; and 3) Julia MacCarthy, daughter of Cormac 'Oge' MacCarthy, in 1568. He and his first wife, Margaret O'Brien (daughter of Murrough) were divorced after he claimed that she worked witchcraft against him. As a result of his father's multiple marriages and relationships there were a number of candidates contending for title Earl of Clanricarde. Richard, the oldest legitimate son, was the eventual successor. He was sporadically opposed by his brothers and half-brothers, including John, who claimed the title in 1568. Richard extended his influence at the expense of the O'Kelly's and the O'Madden's in the east of County Galway, overlordship over the O'Shaughnessey in the south, while allying himself with the O'Conor Don and the O'Brien of Thomond. Other minor allies included the MacCostelloe and MacMorris, who acknowledged him to avoid encroachment from the Bourkes of Mayo. In 1559 Clanricarde fought on the losing side at the Battle of Spancel Hill in County Clare as part of the Gaelic O'Brien succession dispute. From around 1570 his sons rebelled against him and the Anglo-Irish government. That decade witnessed regular warfare across the county which devastated towns such as Galway, Athenry and Loughrea. At the time of his death Burke had endured imprisonment in Dublin, and repeated treachery by his sons. After his death, further warfare was avoided when Ulick Burke killed his brother, John of the Shamrocks, and was acknowledged as the 3rd Earl of Clanricarde. He was called Sassanach (Saxon, or Englishman), because of his association with the Anglo- Irish. He died on 24 July 1582. Annalistic references * AR√â1558.5.

The Earl of Clanrickard gave a great defeat to the Scots. This Earl was Rickard, son of Ulick-na-gCeann, son of Rickard, son of Ulick of Cnoc-tuagh, son of Ulick Meodhanach, son of Ulick of the Wine; and the Scots who sustained that defeat were Donnell, the son of Dowell, son of Gillespick Mac Allen Campbell, and Dowell, the son of Donough, son of Gillespick Mac Allen, two brave young constables of gallowglasses, who had been a long time before hired into the service of the Ultonians, but more particularly in the service of Tirconnell. They had agreed among themselves, stimulated by extraordinary vigour and bravery, to leave those districts, and to proceed through Connaught, to render their names famous. They first passed through the territory of Carbry, the son of Niall, through the lower part of Tirerrill, by the territory of Gaileang (where Cormac Gaileang, the son of Teige, son of Kian, son of Oilioll Olum, settled after having violated the guarantee of his father), and into the country of Awley of Fiachra Tirawley. In this last mentioned territory Mac William (Richard-an-iarrainn, the son of David, son of Edmond, son of Ulick) came to meet them; and he promised to support them for plundering his neighbours and harassing his enemies. When the Earl of Clanrickard heard that this foreign host had arrived in his neighbourhood, he collected the greatest number that he was able of mail-clad warriors and ordnance, and did not halt till he arrived at the place where those Scots were, by the Moy. He was the better of attacking them there, for he routed this foreign band of fiercely rapacious warriors, who did not consider their distance from their native country and their kindred, for they suffered their enemies to slaughter them on the spot. Donnell and Dowell were slain there; but the victory would have been greater if they had been taken prisoners, instead of being slain, for an equivalent ransom in any kind of riches would have been received for them. The power of the Scots was enfeebled in Connaught for a considerable time after this attack. * M1568.1. The Countess of Clanrickard, i.e. Margaret, daughter of Donough, son of Conor, son of Turlough, the most famous woman in Ireland, and the supporter of her friends and relations, died.

It is situated where the roads from Nicosia, Larnaca and Limassol trisected, prior to the by-pass built in the 1990s. History Pre-1974, the village was inhabited by Turkish Cypriots only, the few original Cypriot Greek inhabitants having abandoned the village in the late 1950s. The population of the village also increased substantially after 1964, as some 60 Turkish Cypriot families from Pano Lefkara abandoned their Greek Cypriot dominated village in the aftermath of December 1963 events. The village became infamous on 15 November 1967, when some thousands of National Guards troops overran the TMT (a Turkish-Cypriot armed group) fighters located at the village, including the neighbouring mixed village of Agios Theodoros. Turkish-Cypriot TMT members stationed at the area were controlling the area and blocking the main road from Nicosia to Limassol, making it impossible for Greek-Cypriots civilians to pass through the area without UN escort. On 15 November 1967, General Grivas and his large battalion of mainly mainland Greece originating conscripts caused enough concerns for the lightly armed Turkish Cypriots to return fire when they intruded too closely to the Turkish Cypriot owned land. The fighting escalated and some 24 Turkish Cypriots, including unarmed civilians lost their lives in the overnight events; Turkey's ultimatum the following day resulted in the withdrawal of the National Guard from the two villages. This event in particular saw the return of Grivas and his battalion back to Greece. In addition, this event also culminated in the removal of all road blocks upon which Turkish Cypriot buses entering Nicosia were being stopped and by which means the passengers were subjected to a humiliating body search. After the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the original Turkish Cypriot population of Kophinou were allocated the village of Lefkoniko - the new Ge√ßitkale - in the north by the Cypriot Turkish administration, to this day where many of them reside, whereas the original Turkish Cypriot population of Pano Lefkara are now residing in Agios Theodoros in the north of the island.

Titled The Promoter for its American audience, it was adapted by Eric Ambler and directed by Ronald Neame. It starred Alec Guinness as Denry Machin, Glynis Johns as Ruth Earp, Valerie Hobson as the Countess, and Petula Clark as Nellie Cotterill. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound. It is mainly faithful to the novel, omitting some minor incidents. Plot The film follows the adventures and misadventures of Edward Henry (Denry) Machin, an ambitious young man from a poor background. Denry surreptitiously changes his poor grades in order to qualify for entry to a \\"school for the sons of gentlemen\\". At the age of 16, he becomes a junior clerk to Mr. Duncalf, the town clerk and a solicitor. He meets the charming and socially well-connected Countess of Chell, a client of Duncalf's, and is given the job of sending out invitations to a grand municipal ball. He \\"invites\\" himself, and wins a five-pound bet that he will ask the Countess to dance. This earns him the reputation of a \\"card\\" (a \\"character\\", someone able to set tongues wagging)‚Äîa reputation he is determined to cement. But the next day, Duncalf angrily sacks Denry. Denry offers his services as a rent collector to a dissatisfied client of Duncalf's, Mrs Codleyn. His reputation as an efficient and no-nonsense collector brings the business of Mr Calvert. But Denry quickly realises that he can make more money by advancing loans, at a highly profitable interest rate, to the many tenants who are in arrears. He also discovers that Ruth Earp, the dancing teacher who is attracted to Denry, is herself heavily in arrears to Mr. Calvert. Despite this, he and Ruth become engaged. While on holiday in Llandudno with Ruth and her friend Nellie Cotterill (as chaperone), he witnesses a shipwreck and the rescue of the sailors‚Äîan event that he turns to his financial advantage. He also realises Ruth's spendthrift nature, and they part on bitter terms. Denry starts up the Five Towns Universal Thrift Club, a bold venture that allows members to purchase goods on credit. This increases Denry's wealth and reputation, and he is able to expand further, thanks to the patronage of the Countess. Denry's social ambitions expand. He becomes a town councillor, and he purchases the rights to locally born Callear, the \\"greatest centre forward in England\\", for the failing local football club. Ruth reappears, now the widow of a rich, older, titled man. He considers renewing their relationship but is unsure of his (and her) feelings. Nellie's father, a builder, is bankrupt (again), and the family decides to migrate to Canada. As they are boarding the ocean liner at Liverpool, Denry realises that Nellie is devastated at her potential loss and that he really loves only her. Ruth, who is also present, is furious, but quickly starts a fresh relationship with another older titled gentleman. Nellie and Denry marry. Denry becomes the youngest mayor in the history of Bursley.

The film was one of the first adult screen roles for Clark, who received her first screen kiss. Reception A critic in The Manchester Guardian wrote that \\"Guinness appears to take only a perfunctory interest in 'Denry.' He plays him much too quietly,\\" and that the film \\"never quite takes wings of fancy.\\" The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, writing \\"the script Eric Ambler has adapted from Arnold Bennett's old novel, The Card, is provokingly uninfested with dramatic compulsion or push. It just ambles along very gently from one situation to the next ... The Promoter, while vastly amusing in spots, is not a first-rate Guinness show.\\" In the New York Daily News, reviewer Kate Cameron called the film \\"delightfully amusing,\\" awarding it three and a half out of four stars. Production It was largely filmed in Burslem in Stoke-on-Trent, the basis for the fictional location of Bursley, and in Llandudno, North Wales. Music Clark recorded a vocal version of the film's theme, with lyrics by her long-term accompanist, Joe \\"Mr Piano\\" Henderson.

It has some features common to word processors, but is a native XML editor that can be configured to work with various standard and custom DTDs and XML Schemas. XMetaL was first released by SoftQuad Software in 1999 and is currently developed by JustSystems. Uses XMetaL has a user interface resembling a word processor, in contrast with other XML editors such as XMLSpy that are designed for XML programmers. XMetaL is used by both technical and non-technical writers, most often to develop technical documents, website content, newspaper and magazine content, and organizational policies and procedures. Government agencies also use XMetaL for tracking legislation. Features XMetaL includes features common to word processors, such as a spellchecker, a thesaurus, and the ability to track changes made to documents. XMetaL provides different views of a document, known as ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù, ‚ÄúTags On‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlain Text,‚Äù which reveal the underlying element tags and other XML markup to varying degrees, and uses standard CSS files to style documents for display within the editor. A ‚ÄúResource Manager‚Äù pane can be used to locate and insert items such as image files and frequently reused text fragments. XMetaL can be configured to work with standard or custom DTDs or XML Schemas (XSDs). Once configured, the user interface displays options for inserting elements and attributes declared in the DTD or XSD, and ensures all changes to documents are valid according to the rules of the DTD or XSD. Developers can also associate menu items and toolbar buttons for editing images, tables, and lists with elements and attributes in the particular DTD or XSD. Through a macro facility, developers can add custom dialog boxes, menu commands, toolbar buttons, forms, and behaviors, using languages supported by the Microsoft scripting environment such as JScript and VBScript. It also includes interfaces for COM and Java. XMetaL includes features to import content from a database into an XML document, and can be integrated with other systems via APIs. XMetaL works with a variety of content management systems. The ‚ÄúEnterprise‚Äù version of XMetaL includes the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) DTDs and features for editing and publishing DITA topics and maps. Thin-client version XMAX, a platform for creating thin client custom XML editors, was first released in 2003 under the name ‚ÄúXMetaL for ActiveX‚Äù. XMAX-based applications can run within the Internet Explorer browser for Windows, and can be embedded in other applications that support ActiveX. History XMetaL was first developed by SoftQuad Software, which had previously developed the HTML editor HoTMetaL and the SGML editor Author-Editor. XMetaL 1.0, released in June 1999, was the first stand-alone XML editor to offer a word-processor-like user interface. In 2002, the Ottawa- based Corel Corporation bought SoftQuad, but failed to successfully develop the business. In 2003, XMetaL was rebranded as \\"XMetaL Author\\", as some features for extending and customizing the product were separated into a \\"XMetaL Developer\\" application. In 2004, Corel sold the XMetaL business to Blast Radius, a company based in Vancouver, which was still home to most members of the original XMetaL development team. Critique, a product that had been developed by Blast Radius for collaborative reviewing of XML documents, would later be rebranded as \\"XMetaL Reviewer\\". XMetaL was the first major XML editor to provide specific features for DITA.

Consisting of multiple malls,it was created for Indian traders who were forcibly removed from nearby Fietas by the apartheid government. History Fourteenth Street in Fietas was a thriving business node, with shops owned by Indian businessmen. However, the apartheid government insisted, against objections by officials of the Johannesburg City Council, that the area would be \\"white\\" under the Group Areas Act. Initially all traders were to be removed to Lenasia, however, a plan was devised by the government's Department of Community Development, and the council, resulted in the development of the Oriental Plaza as a large shopping centre in Fordsburg. Development began in 1971, and it was completed in 1975, with the earliest merchants taking occupation in 1974. The compensation payed to Indian merchants who were evicted from businesses throughout Johannesburg was inadequate, however they were pressured into moving into the plaza. Cafe (convenience store) owners and general dealers were forced to create shops that sold goods which appealed to white customers, and to compete with merchants who were more experienced in selling those lines. Business was initially tightly controlled by the department, and shops were not allowed to merge. By the 1980s, restrictions eased, and owners were able to buy their premises. Red Square, a political meeting place in the 1940s and 1950s is now covered by Car Park 4 and the South Mall of the Oriental Plaza. In popular culture The Plaza features in the 2012 movie Material, starring Riaad Moosa. Other shopping centres There is an Oriental Plaza in Ferndale, Randburg.

An American smuggler based in Lisbon is hired to rescue a wealthy industrialist from behind the Iron Curtain.BFI.org The film was shot on location in Lisbon, Portugal, in Trucolor and Naturama for Republic Pictures. Nelson Riddle's score included a version of \\"Lisbon Antigua\\" that had been a top charting song prior to the film's release. Plot The police inspector Fonseca is interested in two Lisbon men in particular, the wealthy and notorious criminal Mavros and an American suspected smuggler with a fast boat, Captain Evans. A number of beautiful women work for Mavros, including a secretary, Maria, who came to him for help when she was destitute. A menacing and jealous servant, Serafim, is secretly in love with Maria, but the attraction is not mutual. Main characters Sylvia Merrill, married to a much older millionaire, is tired of waiting for government officials to rescue her husband Lloyd, a prisoner behind the Iron Curtain. She offers a large sum of money to Mavros, who correctly surmises that Sylvia has an ulterior motive. If her husband dies without a will, it could take as long as seven years for her to inherit his wealth. Evans is hired by Mavros to go after Lloyd in his boat. Having developed a romantic attraction to Maria, the American finds himself hated by Serafim, who attempts to kill him. Mavros gives his man permission to kill Evans during the rescue of Lloyd, and by now Sylvia is on board with the idea that Lloyd won't come back alive, either. Evans manages to foil Serafim's plans and sees him fall to his death. Fonseca, having been tipped off by Maria, has an informer prepared to identify the smuggler, but to the policeman's surprise it is Mavros who is fingered as the culprit rather than Evans. A happy Maria has her man, while Sylvia is left with only a husband she has betrayed.

Reportedly, Paramount Pictures bought the rights to the story in 1951 and Irving Asher was in charge of the production. The topic of the film was sensitive under the Cold War perspective of the 1950s and there were initial concerns about how Paramount would deal with a story involving the Iron Curtain. Luigi Luraschi, Paramount's Head of Foreign & Domestic Censorship at the time, wrote a report to the CIA in January 1953 stating that \\"[Lisbon] could be messy if mishandled, but so far we have them thinking along the right track and this could be very useful to us. Shall watch very carefully.\\" Irving Asher hired director Nicholas Ray and, in early 1953, Joan Crawford was in talks to star as main character Sylvia Merril. Eventually, after several rewrites, the project was shelved as Asher and Crawford weren't sure about the strength of the script. Nicholas Ray and Joan Crawford went on to film the 1954 western Johnny Guitar. Paramount then sold the rights to Republic Pictures and Herbert J. Yates hired Ray Milland for his second directorial effort and starring role in the film. After A Man Alone Yates hired Milland to direct one film a year for four years.Drama: Milland Will Direct, Costar With Maureen Los Angeles Times 27 Oct 1955: A6. Milland reportedly wanted A Man Alone co-star Mary Murphy for the female lead, a part which ultimately went to Irish actress Maureen O'Hara. In her 2004 autobiography, 'Tis Herself: A Memoir, O'Hara wrote about her role in Lisbon: \\"For the first time in my career I got to play the villain, and Bette Davis was right ‚Äì bitches are fun to play.\\" In August 1955 Milland flew to Europe to scout locations.Of Local Origin New York Times 18 Aug 1955: 17. =Filming= Lisbon was entirely produced in the Portuguese capital city of Lisbon and its surrounding municipalities. It was considered the first Hollywood feature made in Portugal. For interior shots, the production used the facilities at Tobis Studios. Exterior shots included many locations in Lisbon, among them the Bel√©m Tower, Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio, the Castle of S√£o Jorge and the Jer√≥nimos Monastery. Outside the capital, there were seaside scenes filmed in Cascais and a scene at the belvedere of the Seteais Palace, in Sintra. Cinematographer Jack A. Marta filmed using the Naturama anamorphic widescreen lens system, a format developed by Republic Pictures in the 1950s. Color filming was achieved using the Trucolor process, developed in the 1940s by Consolidated Film Industries (a division of Republic Pictures). Variety stated that \\"Lisbon makes a colorful setting\\" and \\"Republic's anamorphic Naturama process and Trucolor go a long way towards visual impressiveness.\\" =Music= The song \\"Lisbon Antigua\\" was performed in the film by fado singer Anita Guerreiro, in a restaurant scene. Release Lisbon had its premiere in Los Angeles on August 15, 1956 followed by wide theatrical release on August 17, 1956. For the home market, the film was released on VHS Cassette in the 1990s, bearing the tagline \\"After Casablanca they all came to... Lisbon.\\" As of late 2019 DVD and Blu-ray editions are available at amazon.com. Reception Variety commented, \\"As a smooth, romantically-inclined American amusing himself with smuggling operations, [Ray Milland's] trouping comes off very well. As a production, the picture could have used a little sharper overseeing of story material\\" and concluded, \\"The starring foursome are quite glib and pleasing in the principal roles.\\" See also *List of American films of 1956 References External links  * Category:1956 films Category:1956 crime drama films Category:American crime drama films Category:American spy films Category:American films Category:Cold War spy films Category:Color film noir Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Ray Milland Category:Films scored by Nelson Riddle Category:Films set in Portugal Category:Films set in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Films shot in Portugal Category:Lisbon in fiction Category:Films set in Lisbon Category:Portugal in fiction Category:Republic Pictures films Category:Seafaring films Category:Trucolor films ","title":"Lisbon (1956 film)"},{"id":"23172110","text":"Oasis is an unincorporated community in Mendocino County, California.

Security guard Stephen Tyrone Johns was killed in the shooting, and von Brunn was wounded by two security guards who returned fire. Von Brunn was named the prime suspect in the shooting, and was charged with first-degree murder and firearms violations. While awaiting trial, von Brunn died on January 6, 2010. Von Brunn was a white supremacist, neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier who had written numerous antisemitic essays, created an antisemitic website called The Holy Western Empire, and is the author of a 1999 self-published book, Kill the Best Gentiles, which praises Adolf Hitler and denies the Holocaust, including propagating the belief of a supposed white genocide. After the shooting, traces of his personal writings and works online were deleted from many websites, including AskArt.com, FreeRepublic and his personal user page on Wikipedia where he was indefinitely blocked, the latter said to constitute \\"a violation of policy of hate speech\\". He also made posts expressing his opposition to the Iraq War, and felt that the September 11 attacks were an \\"inside job\\". Life Von Brunn was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the first of two children. His father was a native of Houston, Texas, and a superintendent at the Scullin Steel Mill in Houston during World War II. His mother was a piano teacher and homemaker. Von Brunn enrolled in Washington University in St. Louis in August 1938, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in journalism in April 1943. During his time at the university, von Brunn was said to have been president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, and a varsity football player. He served in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1957, and was the commanding officer of PT boat 159 during the Pacific Theatre of World War II, receiving a commendation and three battle stars. Von Brunn had worked as an advertising executive and producer in New York City for twenty years. In the late 1960s, he relocated to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where he continued to do advertising work and resumed painting. In the early 1970s, Von Brunn briefly worked for Noontide Press, the publishing arm of the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review.https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2009/new- evidence-shows-holocaust-museum-shooter-james-von-brunn-had-long-craved- attention Arrest history Von Brunn's arrest history dates back at least as far as the middle 1960s. In 1968, he received a six-month jail sentence in Maryland for fighting with a sheriff during an incident at the county jail. He had earlier been arrested for driving under the influence following an altercation at a local restaurant in 1966. Von Brunn was arrested in 1981 for attempted kidnapping and hostage-taking of members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors after approaching the Federal Reserve's Eccles Building armed with a revolver, knife, and sawed-off shotgun. Von Brunn later described his actions as a \\"citizen's arrest for treason.\\" He reportedly complained of \\"high interest rates\\" during the incident and was disarmed without any shots being fired, after threatening a security guard with a .38 caliber pistol. He reportedly claimed he had a bomb, which was found to be only a device designed to look like a bomb. He was convicted in 1983 for burglary, assault, weapons charges, and attempted kidnapping. Von Brunn's sentence was completed by September 15, 1989, after he had served six and a half years in prison. After he was released he successfully tested for and joined Mensa International; however, he was eventually dropped from membership for failing to pay his annual dues. Von Brunn was a member of the American Friends of the British National Party, a group that raised funds in the United States for the far right and \\"rights for whites\\" British National Party (BNP). The group had been addressed on at least two occasions by Nick Griffin, an ex-member of the National Front and chairman of the BNP. A BNP spokesperson claimed after the shooting that the party had \\"never heard of\\" von Brunn. In 2004 and 2005 he lived in Hayden Lake, Idaho, the town where Aryan Nations‚Äîa neo-Nazi organization led by Richard Butler‚Äîwas based until 2001. Von Brunn was living in Annapolis, Maryland at the time of the 2009 incident. The shooting Imprisonment and death After the shooting, federal authorities raided his apartment and seized a rifle, ammunition, computers, a handwritten will, and a painting of Jesus Christ standing adjacent to Adolf Hitler. The FBI also stated it discovered child pornography on one of the seized computers. Von Brunn was charged in federal court on June 11, 2009, with first-degree murder and firearms violations; he pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. On July 29, 2009, von Brunn was indicted on seven counts, including four which made him eligible for the death penalty. In September 2009, a judge ordered von Brunn to undergo a competency evaluation to determine whether or not he could stand trial. Von Brunn had the Federal Bureau of Prisons ID# 07128-016 and was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina.\\"James Wenneker Von Brunn.\\" (Archive) Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved on January 6, 2010. On January 6, 2010, von Brunn died in a hospital located near the prison. According to a statement by his attorney, von Brunn had \\"a long history of poor health,\\" including sepsis and chronic congestive heart failure. Reaction The day after the shooting, the Holocaust Museum's flag flew at half-staff in memory of the murdered guard, Stephen Tyrone Johns. The Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. condemned the attack. President Barack Obama said, \\"This outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and FBI stated they had been monitoring von Brunn's internet postings, but were unable to take action because his comments had not crossed the line from free speech into advocating violence. On June 11, 2009, the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington and the InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington led a prayer vigil which took place in front of the museum. Organizers said the vigil was a time to honor Stephen Johns, the slain officer, as well as a time to reflect upon the motivations which led to the shooting spree. Approximately 100 people attended the event, including officials from the Israeli and German embassies. The Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations condemned the attack as well. When the museum reopened on June 12, 2009, Director Sara Bloomfield said attendance was normal or even higher than usual. Many visitors said their attendance was a statement against hate and intolerance. A 17-year-old girl who was in the museum the day of the shooting stated, \\"It's important to come back, because if you don't, they win. It's a form of terrorism.\\" In a statement, von Brunn's son, Erik, expressed sorrow and horror about the shooting. In an article he wrote for ABC News, he stated: The younger von Brunn, who was 32 at the time of the 2009 shooting, did not meet his father until he was nearly 11 years old, after the elder von Brunn completed his prison term for the Federal Reserve incident.

The strikes, as well as street demonstrations, continued throughout spring and summer, ending in early September 1988. These actions shook the Communist regime of the country to such an extent that it was forced to begin talking about recognising Solidarity.Turning the tables? by Andy Zebrowski ‚ÄúThe second massive wave of strikes this year has shaken the Polish regime to such an extent that it doesn't know which way to turn‚Äù As a result, later that year, the regime decided to negotiate with the opposition,Pushing back the curtain. BBC News, Poland 1984 - 1988 which opened way for the 1989 Round Table Agreement. The second, much bigger wave of strikes (August 1988) surprised both the government, and top leaders of Solidarity, who were not expecting actions of such intensity. These strikes were mostly organized by local activists, who had no idea that their leaders from Warsaw had already started secret negotiations with the Communists.Second August, by Andrzej Grajewski  Background  Late 1980s was the time of deep economic crisis of Poland. The military regime of General Wojciech Jaruzelski did not carry out any radical reform of the economy in 1982-1983 following their imposition of Martial Law in Poland. Industrial production remained below the 1979 level. Average inflation rate climbed to 60% by 1988, and Poland‚Äôs hard-currency debt to the Western countries grew from $25 billion in 1981 to $43 billion in 1989.A history of Eastern Europe By Robert Bideleux, page 516 Furthermore, the military rule was a failure, even though Solidarity had been outlawed in 1982, which in turn forced its members to go underground. In those circumstances, anger and frustration of the nation grew, deepened by economic malaise, and constantly declining living standards. More than 60% of population lived in poverty, and inflation, measured by black-market rate of the U.S. dollar, was 1,500% in the period 1982 - 1987.In search of Poland By Arthur R. Rachwald, page 120 On November 29, 1987, the Communists decided to seek popular support for a 110% price increase, calling the Referendum on political and economic reforms (see Referendums in Poland) supported by the old slogan of \\"democratization\\" as the only concession. The government of Zbigniew Messner lost the referendum - according to independent sources, with the turnout of around 30%, but officially, it was announced that 63.8% voters participated in it, and so, deputy prime minister Zdzis≈Çaw Sadowski decided to go on with the price increase. The policy was introduced on February 1, 1988. It was the biggest hike since 1982. The operation was a failure, as the massive price increases were followed by 40% increase in wages, meant to offset the price increases. As a result, inflation rose at alarming speed, and by late 1989, near hyperinflation was reached.Polish hyperinflation and stabilization 1989‚Äì1990 by Grzegorz Kolodko  Repressions against the Solidarity movement  In late 1987, Communist authorities initiated a wave of repressions of activists of underground Solidarity trade union and other oppositional organizations. On November 9, Kornel Morawiecki, leader of Fighting Solidarity was arrested. In the same year, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa resumed his post as leader of Solidarity, where he remained until 1990.Encyclopedia of the Cold War By Ruud van Dijk, page 958 Meanwhile, local branches of the movement tried to legalize themselves in courts across Poland, but all these attempts were refused. On August 31, 1987, the 7th anniversary of the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement, street demonstrations and clashes with police took place in Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw, Lublin, and Bydgoszcz. On March 8, 1988, on the 20th anniversary of the 1968 Polish political crisis, activists of the Independent Students Union organized demonstrations in Warsaw, Krak√≥w and Lublin. Most active demonstrators were immediately repressed by the government.  Spring 1988 strikes  On April 21, 1988, 5000 workers of Stalowa Wola Steelworks organized a meeting, during which they demanded end of repressions of Solidarity activists, and 20,000 z≈Çoty salary increase. The first strikes broke out four days later, on April 25, 1988, in mass transportation centers in northern cities of Bydgoszczhe Encyclopedia of world history By Peter N. Stearns, page 885 and Inowroc≈Çaw. On the next day, one of the biggest companies of the country, Vladimir Lenin Steelworks in Krak√≥w, joined the strike. The workers demanded salary increase, re-employment of Solidarity activists, who had been fired during the martial law, as well as legalization of Solidarity. Meanwhile, a strike broke out in Stalowa Wola Steelworks. Both these actions were suppressed by the Communist security forces (ZOMO), supported by anti-terrorist units. In Stalowa Wola, a demonstration of force, together with threats of use of regular army troops, was sufficient, and the strikers gave up on April 30. In Krak√≥w, however, the workers continued their action, therefore the government decided to use power. In the night of May 4/5, the steelworks were brutally pacified by the ZOMO and anti-terrorist units.April-May strike in Lenin Steelworks In reaction to the attack, workers of several factories across the country organized protests and meetings. On May 1, 1988, opposition activists organized peaceful demonstrations in several Polish cities, such as Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza, Gda≈Ñsk, Krak√≥w, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, P≈Çock, Pozna≈Ñ, Warsaw, and Wroc≈Çaw. They were attended by thousands of people, and in some places, street fights erupted. On the next day, a strike broke out in Lenin Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard, where workers demanded legalization of Solidarity. Soon, Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Andrzej Wielowieyski showed up in Gda≈Ñsk, ready to talk to the management of the plant. However, the talks were fruitless, and on May 10, after threats of use of force, the strike ended in the atmosphere of failure. The last strike of the spring took place in Szczecin, involving workers of city‚Äôs mass transit system.  Summer 1988 strikes  During late spring and early summer of 1988, the situation in Poland did not improve. In several cities, local Solidarity branches unsuccessfully tried to legalize the union. On June 19, local elections took place, and Solidarity urged voters to boycott them. On July 26, government spokesman Jerzy Urban said that Solidarity permanently belonged to the past, and two days later, Polish sociologists announced that only 28% of Poles believed that government‚Äôs reforms would succeed. Most people thought that the reforms would end up with even deeper crisis.Encyclopedia of Solidarity, July 1988 The first strike of summer 1988 took place in the Upper Silesian city of Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j, and it began on August 15. = Upper Silesia = On August 15, a strike broke out at the July Manifesto coal mine in Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j; the mine had been a center of strikes eight years earlier (see Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j 1980 strikes). Importantly, miners from July Manifesto tried to start a strike on May 15, 1988, but the main activists of Solidarity had been arrested by the S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa, whose special agents got word of the plans.Encyclopedia of Solidarity, Jastrzƒôbie again In the second half of August, further mines, most from southern Upper Silesia joined the strikers, and the Interfactory Strike Committee under Krzysztof Zakrzewski was founded in Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j. Miners from Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j were supported by a local priest, reverend Bernard Czernecki. Among the striking coalmines were: * Borynia from Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j, * Jastrzƒôbie from Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j, * Moszczenica from Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j, * ZMP from ≈ªory, * Krupi≈Ñski from ≈ªory, * XXX-lecia PRL from Pni√≥wek, * 1 Maja from Wodzis≈Çaw ≈ölƒÖski, * Marcel from Wodzis≈Çaw ≈ölƒÖski, * Morcinek from Kaczyce, * Andaluzja from Piekary ≈ölƒÖskie, * Lenin from Mys≈Çowice.Encyclopedia of Solidarity, August 1988 Communist secret services, as well as conformist Solidarity leaders, were completely surprised by the strikes in Upper Silesia. In a report dated August 14, 1988, special agents of S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa wrote: ‚ÄúAccording to our sources, opposition leaders are not planning anything‚Äù.Encyclopedia of Solidarity, Jastrzebie again Later, some of the strikes were broken by the Milicja Obywatelska special, antiriot detachments - at Morcinek coalmine in Kaczyce (August 24), Lenin in Myslowice, and Andaluzja in Piekary. Almost all strikes took place in mines, whose employees were people transferred from other areas of Poland in the 1970s. Mines in ‚Äútraditional‚Äù parts of Upper Silesia did not join the protestors, except for Andaluzja from Piekary Slaskie, and Lenin from Myslowice. On September 2, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa appeared in the July Manifesto coalmine, the last place that continued the strike. After his appeal, and a long argument, the miners decided to give up. The strike at July Manifesto was the longest one of Communist Poland.A carnival of revolution By Padraic Kenney, page 234 = Szczecin = On August 17, the Port of Szczecin began to strike. In the following days, other companies from Szczecin stopped working, and the Interfactory Strike Committee was founded. It issued a statement, which consisted of four points, one of which was the demand of legalization of Solidarity. On August 28, the Committee announced that Wa≈Çƒôsa was its sole representative. In response, Wa≈Çƒôsa sent to Szczecin a statement about his meeting with Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak, during which the future Round Table talks had been discussed. Nevertheless, the strikes in Szczecin did not end until September 3. Wa≈Çƒôsa had informed the public about talks with the regime during the August 21 demonstration in Gda≈Ñsk. = Stalowa Wola = By far the biggest strike of summer 1988 took place in Stalowa Wola Steelworks, in which around 10,000 workers participated, and the plant was surrounded by militarized police units.The Washington Post, \\"Polish Unrest Spreads; Dozens of Activists Held; Workers at 2nd Industrial Center Join Protest\\" The Stalowa Wola strike was so significant, that it was dubbed ‚Äúthe fourth nail in the coffin of Communism‚Äù. Since the Steelworks was an arms manufacturer, the factory, which in the 1980s employed around 21,000 people, was under a watchful eye of the security services, and its employees were strictly prohibited from undertaking any kind of oppositional activities. Nevertheless, across the 1980s, it was one of main centers of protests and demonstrations, and in spring of 1988, Stalowa Wola workers started the first strike of that year, which ended after a few days, and which was a prelude of the summer events. On August 22 in the morning, workers of the plant decided to organize a sit-in, with only one demand - legalization of Solidarity.Encyclopedia of Solidarity - Stalowa Wola Steelworks This decision was crucial for further events in Poland, as strikes in Upper Silesia were slowly coming to an end. Led by Wieslaw Wojtas, the strike lasted 11 days. Workers were supported by local priests, and activists of the so-called Supporting Office, who delivered food, medicine, blankets, helped those beaten by government security forces, but also informed Western Europe about situation in Stalowa Wola. Every day, citizens of the town gathered by the Gate 3 to the steelworks, where local parish priest, reverend Edmund Frankowski, celebrated two masses (August 26, and 31), which were attended by up to 10,000 people. Frankowski actively supported the strikers, in the sermons, he urged the faithful to help the workers. The Stalowa Wola strike ended on September 1, after the personal request of Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, who called Wies≈Çaw Wojtas, telling him: ‚ÄúYou are great, but please, end the strike, I am asking you in the name of Solidarity‚Äù. Following Wa≈Çƒôsa's request, 4,000 workers left the factory on September 1, at 7 p.m. Together with around 15,000 inhabitants of the city, they marched to the Church of Mary, Queen of Poland, where they were greeted by reverend Frankowski, who said: ‚ÄúIllegal priest is welcoming participants of the illegal strike‚Äù. = Gda≈Ñsk = On August 19, a group of young activists began circulating leaflets, urging workers of the Gda≈Ñsk Lenin Shipyard to join striking miners from Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j. According to Alojzy Szablewski, who was leader of plant‚Äôs Solidarity, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa was called, and during a meeting it was decided the strike would begin on Monday, August 22.Gazeta Wyborcza, \\"Anniversary of August 1988\\" On that day, at 7 a.m., some 3000 workers put away their tools. Their only demand was short - legalization of Solidarity. Soon afterwards, other main factories of Gda≈Ñsk joined the shipyard - Port Polnocny, Stocznia Polnocna, Stocznia Remontowa. Interfactory Strike Committee was founded, led by Jacek Merkel, and workers were supported by a number of personalities, such as Jacek Kuro≈Ñ, Adam Michnik, Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, and his twin brother Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski. Unlike in August 1980, the 1988 strike was different, as the government lacked power to force the strikers to give up. Furthermore, Gda≈Ñsk Lenin Shipyard was visited by a number of guests from abroad, including Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, in whose presence the use of force was not likely. The events in Gda≈Ñsk were described by Padraic Kenney as truly Orange Alternative strike. Workers of the Gda≈Ñsk Repair Shipyard mocked secret service and police agents, by making a styrofoam tank with the slogan: Leave your arms at the gate, we want dialogue.A carnival of revolution By Padraic Kenney, page 235 The strikes in Gda≈Ñsk ended on September 1, and on September 3, both sides signed an agreement, according to which the communists promised not to persecute the strikers. The promise was broken, and hundreds of people were fired in the fall of 1988.  Outcome  At first, the government tried to threaten the protestors; on August 20, the Committee of National Defence announced preparations for introduction of national state of emergency. However, the determination of the workers made the Communists realize that talks with the officially non-existent trade union were inevitable. On August 31, General Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak met with Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa. During the conversation, which was witnessed by Archbishop Bronis≈Çaw Wac≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski, Kiszczak appealed for putting an end to strikes, he also promised to take care of legalisation of Solidarity. Even though Solidarity activists in several centers opposed Wa≈Çƒôsa's appeal to end strikes, soon afterwards laborers returned to work. The last strikes, in the Port of Szczecin and the July Manifesto coal mine, lasted until September 3. On December 18, Wa≈Çƒôsa established the Solidarity Citizens' Committee, which opened way for the Polish Round Table Agreement. In 1988, director Andrzej Piekutowski made a documentary film Coal Miners‚Äô88, which presents strike in July Manifesto coal mine. Also, Pawel Smolenski and Wojciech Gielzynski wrote a book Workers‚Äô88.

Her paternal grandparents were Albert I of Germany and Elisabeth of Tirol. Her maternal grandparents were James II of Aragon and Blanche of Anjou.  Marriages  It was important for Anna to marry since her elder siblings, Frederick and Elizabeth, had died without children. Anna was originally engaged to the future Casimir III the Great, son of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high and Jadwiga of Greater Poland, but the plans collapsed after Frederick was defeated at the Battle of M√ºhldorf. Between 1326 and 1328, Anna married Henry XV, Duke of Bavaria. The marriage was short, Henry died in 1333 and the couple had no issue. Anna later married John Henry, Count of Gorizia. This marriage was also childless and Anna was widowed again in 1338. Ancestors  Later years  Even though Anna was still young, she didn't remarry.

Philip of Ibelin, seneschal of the Kingdom of Cyprus, had an estate at Alaminos, where he was banished in 1308. The area is home to a still-extant coastal watchtower built under the Venetian rule. There is also the old Church of Agios Mamas, which was restored in 2006. In the Middle Ages, Alaminos housed a monastery where the Georgian monks were active.

In 1994, the official name of the village became Anafotida (), following a decision by the then-government of Cyprus to make the names of villages on the island more Greek. However, locally the village is still referred to as Anafotia. The naming of the village, according to The Great Cyprus Encyclopaedia, derived either from the name ‚ÄúAgia Foteini‚Äù or ‚ÄúFotou,‚Äù the latter meaning 'light'The Great Cyprus Encyclopaedia, vol.2, Philokypros Publications, Nicosia 1986 There is some evidence to suggest the name is derived from the Greek word for light, or fire, fotia, (œÜœâœÑŒπŒ¨) as the Turkish name for the village, Akkor, translates into English as meaning 'incandescent'. Anafotia is mainly agricultural, with tomatoes being a dominant crop. The village centre is small, but there are a number of cafes, a branch of the Co-operative Bank and four churches. The original church is dedicated to St Photeine. A new church was begun in the 1930s dedicated to St Dimitrianos. In his 1936 book Historic Cyprus the British colonial officer Rupert Gunnis thought the new church was so badly constructed it 'may well fall down', a prediction that came true twenty years later.Rupert Gunnis, Historic Cyprus (London: Methuen 1936) 163 In his book Strolling around Cyprus: Larnaka, City and District, Giorgos Karouzis wrote: 'While strolling along Anafotia, one mainly gets to see cultivated expanses of land. In particular, the village produces citrus fruit, watermelons, melons, tomatoes and cucumbers. A special place among the cultivations is held by the olive groves and the vineyards. In fact, according to the elderly residents of the village, as Karouzis preserves, the community used to be covered with even more vineyards which occupied large expanses of land. However, apart from cultivated pieces of land, there are also the uncultivated ones which take up 1000 square metres of land.'Giorgos Karouzis, Strolling around Cyprus: Larnaka, City and District, Nicosia 2001 During the Greek Cypriot uprising against British rule from 1955 to 1959, which aimed to secure union of Cyprus with the Kingdom of Greece through the process of Enosis, EOKA fighter Michalakis Parides, who was born in Anaphotia, died in a shoot out with British troops in 1958, in the village of Vavla, near Pano Lefkara.

It can be made from cow or goat milk and is fermented in a specially made calabash gourd locally known as a sotet. The gourd is lined with soot from specific trees which add flavor to the fermented milk. It is normally consumed with ugali or on its own and is served at room temperature or chilled. Culture Mursik has strong cultural significance for the Kalenjin both in terms of identity as well as socially. It is a common drink in the Rift Valley region and is available in urban areas of Kenya. It has over time become synonymous with Kenyan athletics. A significant majority of Kenyan athletic heroes are Kalenjin and scenes of them receiving a sip of mursik at the airport having returned from international duty form part of Kenya's cultural tapestry.Kibor, F., Tracing the origins of mursik, The Standard, 9th March 2016 online When a couple gets married, dowry negotiations are held as part of the koito ceremony. At the end of the negotiations, mursik is served and drunk together by those present as a symbol of agreement and unity, it is considered crucial to the process.Mursik season!, NTV News online Preparation Mursik is prepared primarily from cows' milk (but also less commonly goat's milk, or rarely sheep's milk) fermented in specially made seasoned milk gourds that are pre-treated with the smoke and charcoal of certain species of trees prior to each use. Fresh/raw milk (or, more commonly in modern times, milk that has been first boiled then cooled to ambient temperature) is poured into the specially prepared gourd. The gourd is then capped and placed in a cool dry place to undergo spontaneous fermentation for at least three to five days, through the action of lactic acid bacteria, yeast and mould species. Traditionally in some communities, but very rarely in modern times, fresh blood tapped from a cow may have been added to fresh milk before fermentation, or to already fermented milk. Lactobacillus plantarum was found to be the most dominant of the lactic acid bacteria involved in the production of mursik. Other lactic acid bacteria isolated from mursik are Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Enterococcus faecium. Saccharomyces sp. and Geotrichum candidum have also been isolated from mursik Smoke and charcoal from specific trees has long been used in the traditional production of fermented milk products in Kenya. Among the common tree species used by farmers for milk treatment in production of mursik are Senna didymobotrya, Lippia kituiensis, Prunus africana and Olea europaea ssp. africana. A gourd is smeared inside with special charcoal called \\"osek\\"; from this, gray lines can be seen when pouring the thick, sour milk. In preparing the gourd, the Kalenjin women, for instance, make a brush (sosiot) from a branch of cycad tree used to clean the inside. Brushes made from this tree are hardy and may last for up to two years before replacement. Charcoal \\"osek\\", formed from the smouldering embers of branches from the Ite or Itet tree (peanut butter cassia, scientifically known as Senna didymobotrya), is used as a milk preservative. Women use the embers to coat the inside of the cleaned gourd. The charcoal has various effects. It lines the inside of the gourd, reducing its porosity rendering it airtight. The smoke from the embers also has a preservative effect which prevents undesired bacterial multiplication that causes spoilage, while allowing natural souring. The charcoal smoke imparts a special flavour to the milk, and a bluish colour which is of high aesthetic value to the consumer. Having prepared the gourd, women pasteurize the milk by boiling. The pasteurized milk is left to cool before pouring into the gourd. Finally the gourd is corked to render it airtight, making it possible for the milk to be preserved for up to a month. Variations There are various flavours of mursik, depending on how it is prepared and what quality of milk is used. Many tree species have been adjudged suitable for the purpose of imparting the preservative and aromatic effect to milk. There are many causes of unusual milk flavour, including the effect of plain gourd walls, which impart a bittersweet tang, and the plainness of white ripened milk, the role of itet is paramount. Several trees are good for the purpose. One characteristic is common though: high tannin content in the bark of the tree concerned. The popular ones include sertwet (acacia) and Cheblayat (wattle tree). Cheblayat is by far the most commonly used, on account of nearly universal availability, although sertwet is preferred by the purists. Mursik can be prepared from a full gourd of milk corked all at once. Another method of preparing it is by pouring in a pint every three days or so. The fermented milk provides the culture for the new milk, and seems to accelerate its ripening. After the gourd is full, it is corked for a while, to achieve a varied consistency of proper sour milk, and results in a clear, sharp (almost bitter in some cases) liquid in which white globules of butter float, shaken well. Another type is the fast fermenting, even type, which gives a white, porridge like consistency. Another Variant of Mursik is called Rotik. this variant, contains blood mixed with milk and let to ferment and has a slightly pink colouration. This variant is rare to come by as the practice of drawing blood from cattle is no longer being practiced widely. This variant is believed to be rich in iron and protein and was given to women who had just delivered or warriors who were wounded in battle.

VDW has been in use since the late 1990s, and its use is expected to increase rapidly over the next five years due to advances in technology and decreasing costs for the voice directed software and for the mobile computers on which it runs. In a voice directed warehouse, workers wear a headset connected to a small wearable computer, similar in size to a Sony Walkman, which tells the worker where to go and what to do using verbal prompts. Workers confirm their tasks by speaking pre-defined commands and reading confirmation codes printed on locations or products throughout the warehouse. The speech recognition software running on the wearable computer 'understands' the workers' responses. Voice-directed warehousing is typically used instead of paper- or mobile computer-based systems that require workers to read instructions and scan barcodes or key-enter information to confirm their tasks. By freeing a worker's hands and eyes, voice directed systems typically improve efficiency, accuracy, and safety. Whilst VDW was originally used in picking orders, now all warehouse functions such as goods receiving, put-away, replenishment, shipping, and returns processing can be coordinated by voice systems. Overview The first incarnations of voice directed warehousing were implemented in distribution centers in the early 1990s. Since then, voice has changed dramatically. Most notably, the technology was originally limited to picking, whereas now all warehouse functions (picking, receiving/put-away, replenishment, shipping) can be coordinated by voice systems. As these processes move from being paper-centric, to RF-centric (barcode scanning) and now voice-centric. For some, voice has become the starting point for re- engineering warehouse processes and systems, rather than an after-thought. VDW technology has also undergone an evolution as more competitors have entered the market. The first solutions were based on dedicated and rugged voice appliances, mobile computing devices that ran the speech recognition software and that communicated with a server over a wireless network. These special purpose voice appliances use a speech recognition engine that was specially designed for the warehouse and provided by the appliance manufacturer. Since the early 2000s, more voice suppliers have entered the market, providing voice recognition systems for standard mobile computing devices that had been used previously for barcode scanning applications in the warehouse. These standard mobile computers from companies like Motorola, Intermec and LXE also support non-proprietary recognition software. The uncoupling of the hardware and speech recognition software has resulted in lower priced voice-directed warehousing solutions and an increase in the number of software providers. These two factors contributed to a rapid rise in adoption of VDW that continues today. Potential benefits Implementing voice systems in the warehouse has among its benefits: *Increased picking accuracy *Increased inventory accuracy *Increased employee productivity *Improved safety *Reduced new worker training time *Increases job satisfaction for warehouse associates *Eliminates cost of printing and distributing picking documents *Growing customer satisfaction One of the great productivity benefits of voice-based systems is that they allow operators to do two things at once whereas other media used in warehouses such as paper or radio frequency terminals tend to require that you surrender the use of at least one hand or you have to stop and read something before proceeding. This productivity benefit tends to be inversely related to the fraction of an operator's day spent walking.

As a logotype, they use a family crest which was carved in 1672, to decorate the doorway of a house built in Riquewihr by one of Hans Ulrich's sons In 1902, Hugel & Fils, which was then managed by Fr√©d√©ric Emile Hugel, moved to its present location in the centre of Riquewihr. In the second half of the 20th century, Jean Hugel played a leading role in Hugel & Fils as well as in the Alsace wine industry in general. Jean Hugel and Hugel & Fils pioneered the reintroduction of late harvest wines in Alsace. The 1984 wine regulations setting down the requirements for Vendange Tardive and S√©lection de Grains Nobles wines is usually referred to as \\"Hugel's Law\\". Wines in this style were also produced by Hugel before these designations had been invented, and some earlier versions were marketed using designations from the German wine classification, such as Beerenauslese.

Instead, Hugel uses its own quality designations. Although Hugel was a pioneer in sweet Alsace wines, only wines clearly marked as late harvest wines or special cuv√©es have noticeable residual sugar; the wines of the regular range are always dry. For wines at the Tradition level and above, Hugel typically releases the wines when they are judged to be ready for sale. Thus, at a given time, different vintages may be in distribution for wines of different grape varieties, and the sweet wines are often sold with several years of bottle age. The labels of all Hugel wines feature a similar yellow design, but with some differences between the various quality levels.

It was made by the British subsidiary of Warner Brothers at the company's Teddington Studios.Wood p.81 It was made as a more expensive production than much of the studio's low- budget quota quickie output. It is based on a 1928 play by Ladislas Fodor which has been turned into films on several occasions including a 1931 German film Poor as a Church Mouse and the 1932 American production Beauty and the Boss. A bank owner's prim and uptight Secretary suddenly blossoms during a business trip to Paris. Plot The opening scenes show the historical development of Steele's Bank in London as it adopts first steel pens and then typewriters during the nineteenth century. In 1934 the current head of the bank Jonathan Steele is as technology-obsessed as his predecessors and installs an intercom and constantly flies by plane. Steele strictly divides his life between work and pleasure. He dismisses a very attractive secretary who is distracting him by trying to seduce him at work, in order that they can become lovers after office hours. This creates a vacancy which a hard-pressed young woman Betty Miller who self-describes herself as a \\"church mouse\\" fills by showing Steele how super-efficient she is. Miller rapidly becomes invaluable to Steele, but comes to resent the fact that only sees her as an employee rather than a woman. While in Paris, to seal a major business deal she has a major makeover, and suddenly finds herself attracting a great deal of male attention.

Manu achieved a solid reputation as head chef at the restaurant Bilson's before moving to open his own restaurant, Manu at L'√âtoile, in 2009. The restaurant closed in March 2014. Biography In spite of a history of professional chefs in his family, including his father and a grandfather, Feildel decided to join a circus school at age 13 and learnt juggling, unicycling, clowning and some acrobatics. He stayed for three years and then decided that cooking was his first love and moved to London where he studied at the Cafe Royal restaurant. He then worked at Les Associes, the Cafe des Amis du Vin and popular seafood restaurant Livebait. Career Relocating to Australia in 1999, he worked at a number of restaurants for several years before opening the kitchen as head chef at Bilson's on invitation of its owner, offering contemporary French cuisine. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, he was a key factor in Bilson's \\"three-hat success\\". The Daily Telegraph indicates that it is for his service at this \\"exceptional fine diner\\" that he has fame among food lovers. Feildel began appearing on Ready Steady Cook in 2006 and on MasterChef Australia in 2009 and has co-hosted My Kitchen Rules since 2010. Also in 2009, Feildel left Bilson's and opened his own French bistro, Manu at L'√âtoile. However, the restaurant closed in March 2014, with Feildel citing a \\"nightmare year\\" with too much happening including his My Kitchen Rules commitments and increased competition that had hurt his business, meaning he could no longer afford to stay open. In 2010, he was the celebrity contestant in the first episode of the short lived Australian version of Beat the Star. Feildel won the 2011 series of Dancing with the Stars and appeared at the 2011 Good Food & Wine Show. He was also nominated for the Most Popular New Male Talent at the Logie Awards of 2011. He hosted the reality dating series Dinner Date in 2011. Following the closure of his Sydney restaurant, Manu at L'√âtoile, Feildel in partnership with chef George Calombaris opened a new restaurant Le Grand Cirque in Melbourne, which closed 4 months after opening, in August 2014. In April 2014, Feildel hosted a two-part travel-cooking documentary entitled My France With Manu which follows Feildel travelling through western France, highlighting the local food, scenery and his memories of France. The show originally screened on the Seven Network. Manu has starred as a recurring character on the Aunty Donna podcast, where he is portrayed by Zachary Ruane. The character of Manu has incurred significant controversy during his time on the show, including holocaust denial and taking responsibility for the September 11 attacks. One of the podcast's guests, Jared Jekkyl, claims to have met Manu in person during filming of My Kitchen Rules in Manu's home. Manu himself has so far failed to comment on his portrayal by the group aside from a brief mention on the Today show in 2019. Feildel appears in the 2018 film The BBQ as French chef, Andre Mont Blanc. In 2019, he became a judge on the revived version of Australia's Got Talent for the Seven Network. It was announced on 23 October 2019 that Feildel would join former MasterChef judges Gary Mehigan and Matt Preston in 2020 on a new cooking competition show called Plate of Origin. He is a judge of the spinoff Australia's Got Talent: Challengers & Champions. Community work In March 2013, Feildel trekked the Kokoda Track to raise money for CanTeen, the Australian organisation for young people living with cancer. Each participant donated $5,000 to join the trek. Feildel is also an ambassador for Camp Quality, a children's family cancer charity whose motto is \\"laughter is the best medicine\\".Camp Quality  Retrieved 7 April 2013 Personal life Feildel and his partner Veronica Morshead separated during 2009, after 12 years together.

Bonner (born November 17, 1997) is an American philanthropist and founder of the non-profit charity Little Red Wagon Foundation. Bonner received the Presidential Service Award in 2006. When he was seven years old, he founded the organization to aid the 1.3 million homeless children in the United States. Bonner said that, \\"These kids don't have a home, they don't have a safe place to sleep at night. They're out on the streets not because they want to be, but because it's out of their control.\\" In 2007, Bonner began his three-stage \\"My House to the White House\\" project. The project's purpose was to raise money and awareness for homeless children. In 2007, he walked 280 miles from Tampa to Tallahassee, Florida, while in 2008, he covered 250 miles from Tallahassee to Atlanta, Georgia. In the final leg of the trip, he walked 668 miles from Georgia to Washington D.C. Upon the completion of the \\"My House to the White House\\" project, Bonner planned another project, March Across America. From March 23 to September 14, 2010, he walked 2,448 miles from Tampa to Los Angeles. Starring Chandler Canterbury as Bonner, Little Red Wagon, a docudrama about Bonner's philanthropic work, was filmed in 2010 and released in 2012. Philanthropy Bonner with friends and Volunteer Florida staff members Bonner has done a variety of volunteer work since he was six years old. In 2004, when Hurricane Charley hit neighborhoods, he collected 27 pickup trucks of water in his little red wagon. He established the Little Red Wagon Foundation to \\"continue helping kids more efficiently\\". Bonner teamed up with the StandUp For Kids and collected 400 backpacks of supplies, nicknamed \\"Zachpacks\\", for homeless children. The Zachpacks were filled with donated snacks, toys, and toiletries. To date he has distributed over 10,000 of the Zachpacks. Bonner organized Christmas parties for homeless children living in Baker, Louisiana, and he gave Christmas presents to Hurricane Katrina victims. To mitigate the adverse effects of homelessness, Bonner hosted parties for children who live in shelters at Build-A-Bear Workshop, Chuck E. Cheese's, and Six Flags. In April 2007, he organized 24 Hours, an event that simulated being homeless for 24 hours. During that period of time, students in high school stayed in their own separate boxes for 24 hours. 24 Hours 2015 was the seventh year of the event in which youths 12 to 21 years old each paid $24 to live in cardboard boxes for an hour to simulate being homeless. In January 2010, he launched a national campaign to end child homelessness. As keynote speaker at The Children's Philanthropy Center Annual Youth Symposium in Northern Virginia, he inspired young activists to use their voice to create change. The message, \\"You Matter! Let Your Voice Be Heard\\" became the signature anthem for their youth advocacy movement. =My House to the White House= Zach Bonner's \\"My House to the White House\\" project took place in three stages covering 1,225 miles to raise awareness and funds for homeless children. The first leg in 2007 from November 3‚Äì26 covered 280 miles from Tampa to Tallahassee, Florida and raised $25,000. The second leg in the fall of 2008 covered over 250 miles from Tallahassee to Atlanta, Georgia. The third leg of the trip began May 11, 2009. The 668-mile, 59-day walk from Georgia to Washington D.C. was completed on July 10. On the final stretch of the walk, 500 people, among them 300 homeless children, walked with Bonner down the National Mall. Bonner met with Saxby Chambliss and spoke with several other U.S. Senators on Capitol Hill. He slept at the Sasha Bruce emergency shelter. =March Across America= In 2010, he walked from Tampa to Los Angeles. Calling the trip \\"March Across America\\", he began the 2,478-mile walk on March 23, 2010. Bonner walked an average of 17‚Äì22 miles every day. During his walk, he gave gift cards to people in need. Multiple television and radio stations tracked for their viewers Bonner's journey across America using the \\"Zach Tracker\\" GPS. Lee Cowan of NBC Nightly News \\"Making A Difference\\" profiled Bonner in early August; Cowan called Bonner a \\"pint-sized philanthropist\\". On the show, Bonner said that \\"When you're having a bad day you (have) to realize that someone else is having a lot worse of a day than you.\\" Bonner planned to complete the walk by September, after 178 days of walking. On September 14, 2010, Bonner completed the nearly 2,500-mile-walk to Santa Monica, California. At the age of 12, he became the youngest person to walk from the East Coast of the United States to the West Coast of the United States. =Zach In A Box= Beginning March 26, 2013, Bonner lived seven days in a plexiglas box in a field near Westfield Brandon mall. With plywood serving as the box's bottom, pieces of cardboard, and a sleeping bag, Bonner aimed to imitate a homeless person's lodgings. Naming his fundraising effort \\"Zach In A Box\\", he encouraged people to donate non-perishable food. He wanted to coat all four walls of his box with donated canned food items. After seven days of donations from children and adults as well as a $1,000 donation from Sweetbay Supermarket, Bonner gave over 6,000 cans of food to Metropolitan Ministries and Francis House. =Food for a Million= From noon November 7, 2014, to noon November 8, 2014, at the Metropolitan Ministries' holiday tent in Tampa, Bonner hoped to set a Guinness World Record for amassing the most canned food items in 24 hours. He organized \\"World's Largest Food Drive: Food for a Million\\" with Metropolitan Ministries and Feeding America Tampa Bay, an attempt to collect one million pounds of food in 24 hours. Walmart, Winn-Dixie, Performance Food Group, and Publix promised to contribute food to the effort.

Awards and recognition Bonner receives the President's Volunteer Service Award from President Bush Bonner meets President Bush In 2006, Zach has received the Presidential Service Award from President George W. Bush. In the same year, he was honored with the Points of Light Award by Florida governor Jeb Bush for his volunteer service. Bonner has met George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He has been featured on Good Morning America and in 2011 was named a hometown hero by Reader's Digest. In 2007, Bonner was named one of 12 \\"Huggable Heroes\\" by the Build-A-Bear Workshop. On March 19, 2008, he received the Alexandra Scott Butterfly Award from the Volvo for life Awards, hosted by Volvo on 42nd Street. In 2009, the readers and editors of Beliefnet chose Bonner as the Most Inspiring Person of the Year. Receiving 22% of the vote, Bonner defeated the \\"hero pilot\\" Chesley Sullenberger and students in Iran who protested against a rigged election despite considerable jeopardy to their lives. Elton John donated $25,000 to Bonner's cause after Bonner completed the 1,200-mile-walk from Tampa, Florida, to Washington, D.C.. Philanthropy Project movie Michael Guillen, the CEO of the non-profit organization Philanthropy Project, planned to make a $5 million movie about the Zach Bonner's walks and the Little Red Wagon Foundation. Bonner's story was selected from among a pool of 6,000 candidates. After the number of candidates was narrowed to 12, Bonner's story was unanimously chosen. Praising Bonner for his philanthropy, Guillen said that \\"[h]e's sincere. He's humble. He's generous. He's everything that is good about our country. So... when I see Zach, I see the future of our country, and I think we're going to be in good hands.\\" Patrick Sheane Duncan is the movie's screenwriter, and David Anspaugh is its director. The John Templeton Foundation funded the film which was produced by Michael Guillen of Philanthropy Project, Barbara Kelly, and Steve Golin and David Kanter of Anonymous Content. Little Red Wagon was filmed in May 2010. Personal life Zach L. Bonner was born in Searcy, Arkansas on November 17, 1997. He lives in a single-parent household after losing his father in a motorcycle accident and now resides in Valrico, Tampa, Florida with his mother Laurie and sister Kelley. Bonner's mother is a real estate agent and investor. His sister is about 10 years older than he is. Bonner took classes on the Internet through the K12 Florida Virtual Instruction Program. The online program allowed him to keep up in his studies by working outside of the typical school day. In his free time in 2007, Bonner played little league baseball. He also played tennis and went on bike rides with his friends. When he was three years old, Bonner joined Taekwondo's junior program and after years of study, he subsequently earned a black belt. In a November 2007 interview with The Independent Florida Alligator, he said he wished to go to college at Harvard University and attend Yale Law School, so that he can become a prosecutor. In a January 2013 interview with Canada.com, he confirmed that he still wanted to become a lawyer, noting that he was unsure about whether he wanted to be a prosecutor or specialize in family law. That same month, he told The Christian Post that he wanted to study law to \\"be able to tie in the [Little Red Wagon] Foundation and continue to help more people\\". A February 2017 article in the Tampa Bay Times noted that Bonner attended the Brandon campus of Hillsborough Community College during high school, and presently works at Apple Inc. After high school, he attended the University of Florida where he studied Computer Science and Software Engineering.

Sotira Culture Sotira Culture (Ceramic Neolithic Period) 5000 - 4000 BCE filled the gap left by the abandonment of Khirokitia Culture sites. The culture appears to have formed about two centuries after the first influx of pottery on the island, brought in by a new wave of settlers who arrived around 5250 BC. Some sources place the rise of the Sotira at a later date, around 4500 BC, but most seem to agree that there was a gap of about five hundred years between the fall of the Khirokitia and the very first appearance of the Sotira. Despite evidence of settlers who brought new technologies and techniques with them, there is no evidence of any external trade. Social stratification is also difficult to ascertain during this comparatively short-lived period. The culture gained its name through the examination of a typical site at Sotira-Teppes. At the Sot√≠ra Neolithic settlement lies a tightly-packed group of house foundations of light construction. In form they ranged from circular to rectangular with rounded angles, the upper parts of the walls were evidently of mud brick and the roofs of the rectangular houses probably flat. The topmost floors overlay a demolition layer which sealed well-preserved hearths, post-holes, and other features. These lower floors yielded an unusually rich series of implements, of flint, stone and bone, as well as bowls and jugs of the combed ware. A. H. S. Megaw (1952). Archaeology in Cyprus, 1951. The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 72, pp 113-117. doi:10.2307/627998. Like most Ceramic Neolithic sites, this was located near the coast, on high ground which was easily defendable. Another key site is at Ayios Epiktitos-Vyrsi. Ceramic sites are only found on the east of the island, showing that these newcomers did not reach either the west or the Karpass Peninsula (the long 'finger' at the north-eastern corner of Cyprus). There were regional differences, and technical improvements as the culture progressed. Of the thirty villages known to have been home to the culture, only a few were still inhabited in the next period but, as with the Khirokitia before it, why the majority of Sotira sites were abandoned is not known.http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsEurope/GreeceCyprus.htm References Category:Communities in Limassol District ","title":"Sotira, Limassol"},{"id":"23172619","text":"Oleksandr Hryhorovych Kiryukhin (;On the Dynamo's roster for 1999 Cup final (–öi—Ä—é—Ö—ñ–Ω) ; born 1 October 1974) is a retired Ukrainian professional footballer.

Background Antioch College was founded in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Horace Mann, Antioch College‚Äôs first president's goal was to create an educational environment that was stimulating and unconventional in its approach to learning. Antioch evolved from a small liberal arts college to a multi-campus university system with five campuses located across the nation in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Keene, New Hampshire, Seattle, Washington, Santa Barbara, California and Los Angeles, California. The Antioch University system and Antioch College are no longer affiliated in any way. History Antioch University Los Angeles is one of the five campuses of Antioch University. The seeds of the modern Antioch University were sown in the birth of an independent, non-sectarian college founded in 1852 and then created in 1964 with the founding of the Putney School of Education in New England, the first of its present campuses. Antioch University was originally a single campus college, Antioch College, and was the result of American educator Horace Mann's dream to establish a college comparable to Harvard but with some notable differences. This college was to be completely non-sectarian and co- educational, and with a curriculum that would not only include the traditional treatment of the classics, but would emphasize science and the scientific method, history and modern literature. Students would not compete for grades, but would be encouraged to pursue issues of interest to them, read what they considered worthwhile and present papers on topics of their own choosing. Founded in 1852 as Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Horace Mann became the first president in 1853. From its inception, racial and gender equality, independent study and independent thinking were integral parts of Antioch College. Six students were accepted for the first quarter: four men and two women who came to share the same college classrooms for the first time in the U.S. The notion of gender equality extended also to the faculty. Antioch was the first U.S. college to designate a woman as full professor, and the original faculty included seven men and two women. Then, in 1863, the college instituted the policy that no applicant was to be rejected on the basis of race. While Antioch College never diverged from the philosophy of Horace Mann, the final form of an Antioch education traced its roots from the election of Arthur Morgan as President of the college in 1920. Morgan, like Mann, believed in the development of the individual as a whole. Having seen the difficulty encountered by ivory-tower academicians attempting to participate in the business world, he resolved to change the cloistered educational experience by providing students with work experience in their field. He wrote ‚ÄúThe Plan for the New Antioch‚Äù which was his vision for the future of the school. This was the beginning of Antioch's unique program of work and study, what Morgan termed, ‚Äúindustrial education.‚Äù Morgan initiated the practice of student government. He also changed the nature of the admissions procedure. Rather than relying on entrance examinations, Morgan opted for more personal information on prospective students. In addition, senior exams were graded \\"honors\\" or \\"pass\\", and students who failed could retake the exam. Morgan remained at Antioch until 1933, when President Roosevelt requested that he assume directorship of the Tennessee Valley Authority Project. Antioch University Los Angeles was established in 1972, with just 12 students. The campus is located in Culver City, within the Greater Los Angeles area, approximately where the 405 and 90 freeways cross. There are currently about 1,200 students enrolled.  Academics  The University offers undergraduate degree completion programs in Liberal Studies, Applied Studies, Applied Arts and Media, Urban Communities and Justice, and Applied Technology and Business Leadership, and graduate programs in Nonprofit Management, Education and Teacher Credentialing, Psychology, Creative Writing, and Urban Sustainability. Antioch University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).  Social support  *The Bridge Program offers a year of humanities education for college credit at no cost to students.

As each rower has only one oar, the rowers have to be paired so that there is an oar on each side of the boat.US Rowing This is in contrast to sculling when a rower has two oars, one in each hand. In the UK the term is less used as the term rowing generally refers to sweep oar. The term pulling was also used historically.W B Woodgate Boating Read Books, 2008 Sweep or single oar rowing has a long history and was the means of propulsion for Greek triremes and Viking longboats. These boats were wide enough for the pairs of rowers to sit alongside each other. Boats can go faster, the narrower they are, because a smaller cross-sectional area reduces drag and wave drag and gives a sharper angle to the bow. The hulls can be kept narrower by attaching riggers to the gunwales, so that the oarlocks can be placed farther out to carry longer oars. A narrower hull means the rowers cannot sit side by side and so they sit one behind another. The riggers are staggered alternately along the boat so that the forces apply asymmetrically to each side of the boat. This means a sweep oared racing shell has to be stiffer in order to handle the unmatched forces, and so requires more bracing, which means it has to be heavier and slower than an equivalent sculling boat. Sweep rowing has to be done with crews in multiples of two: pairs, fours and eights (sixes and boats longer than eight are not used in competitive racing today). Each rower in a sweep boat is on either stroke side (port) or bow side (starboard), according to which side of the boat the rower's oar extends from. In a sculling boat the riggers apply forces symmetrically. While sculling boats are also in multiples of two, it is possible to have a single scull or triple scull. The primary sweep oar racing boats are as follows. ;Eight (8+) : A shell with 8 rowers. Always with coxswain because of the size, weight and speed of the boat; bow loader eights exist but are banned from most competitions for safety reasons. ;Four (4-) or (4+) : A shell with 4 rowers. Coxless fours (4-) are often referred to as straight fours, and are commonly used by lightweight and elite crews and are raced at the Olympics. In club and school rowing, one more frequently sees a coxed four (4+) which is easier to row, and has a coxswain to steer. ;Pair (2-) or (2+): A shell with 2 rowers. The coxless pair (2-), often called a straight pair, is a demanding but satisfying boat to master. Coxed pairs (2+) are rarely rowed by most club and school programs. It is no longer an Olympic class event, but it continues to be rowed at the World Rowing Championships.

The modern application of stochastics to quantum mechanics involves the assumption of spacetime stochasticity, the idea that the small-scale structure of spacetime is undergoing both metric and topological fluctuations (John Archibald Wheeler's \\"quantum foam\\"), and that the averaged result of these fluctuations recreates a more conventional- looking metric at larger scales that can be described using classical physics, along with an element of nonlocality that can be described using quantum mechanics. A stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics is due to persistent vacuum fluctuation. The main idea is that vacuum or spacetime fluctuations are the reason for quantum mechanics and not a result of it as it is usually considered. Stochastic mechanics The first relatively coherent stochastic theory of quantum mechanics was put forward by Hungarian physicist Imre F√©nyesSee who was able to show the Schr√∂dinger equation could be understood as a kind of diffusion equation for a Markov process. Louis de Broglie felt compelled to incorporate a stochastic process underlying quantum mechanics to make particles switch from one pilot wave to another. Perhaps the most widely known theory where quantum mechanics is assumed to describe an inherently stochastic process was put forward by Edward NelsonSee and is called stochastic mechanics. This was also developed by Davidson, Guerra, Ruggiero and others. Stochastic electrodynamics Stochastic quantum mechanics can be applied to the field of electrodynamics and is called stochastic electrodynamics (SED). SED differs profoundly from quantum electrodynamics (QED) but is nevertheless able to account for some vacuum- electrodynamical effects within a fully classical framework. In classical electrodynamics it is assumed there are no fields in the absence of any sources, while SED assumes that there is always a constantly fluctuating classical field due to zero-point energy.

History PVMI, founded as the International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1979, has mapped lean methodologies, established benchmarking standards, and probed the automotive value chain. The program's data-driven methods set the standard for industry research. In 2013, program was restructured and renamed as part of its incorporation into the Mack Institute for Innovation Management at the Wharton School. PVMI/IMVP has had a major impact on the global automobile industry and the economy that surrounds it since it was launched in 1979. More than 50 senior scientists, management experts, social scientists, and engineers have conducted interdisciplinary automotive research at more than 25 universities on six continents. The program has gone through several phases since its conception in 1980: * Phase One (1979‚Äì1990) During this first phase, IMVP is best known for developing the name ‚Äúlean production‚Äù to characterize the new paradigm that challenged mass production starting in the 1970s and 1980s, documented in the landmark book The Machine that Changed the World. * Phase Two (1990‚Äì1998) IMVP tracked the diffusion of lean production. Researchers examined barriers to the adoption of ‚Äúlean‚Äù and renewed efforts by mass production-oriented firms to innovate. The program‚Äôs longitudinal benchmarking projects tracked the worldwide convergence in performance in manufacturing productivity and quality. * Phase Three (1998-2013) IMVP continued tracking disruptive changes in the auto industry, including massive reductions in vertical integration, increases in outsourcing, experiments with modularity, and the influx of new technologies. A significant publication during this time was the book Clockspeed: Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage. * Phase Four (2013-Present) This phase marks the transition from IMVP to PVMI and the program‚Äôs integration into the Mack Institute for Innovation Management at the Wharton School. Ongoing research focuses on disruptive technologies and new business models affecting the evolving global automotive industry and the broader mobility domain. A significant project is an electric vehicle forecasting challenge in cooperation with the Good Judgment Project, based on the work of Philip E. Tetlock and Barbara Mellers.

Akanthou is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus. , it had a population of 1,459.  History  The first settlement that can be linked with the modern-day Akanthou was in the Kouphes area, 2 miles to the northwest of Akanthou. Akanthou was established between the 7th and the 10th century at the place where the river passing through the village meets the sea. Following the Mamluk Arab raids in Cyprus, the coastal location was abandoned and the village moved to its present-day inland location. The name Akanthou, according to local tradition, comes from the name of a thorny bush present in the area, which is said to have provided protection for a beautiful woman, Anthousa, who the Arab sailors tried to take captive. Akanthou was recorded to be under the fiefdom of a nobleman called Sir John Gorap in 1385. It was the place of landing for Ottoman troops under √áƒ±fƒ±toƒülu Ahmet Pasha that came to Cyprus to suppress the rebellion headed by Boyacƒ±oƒülu Mehmet Agha against Ottoman rule between 1680 and 1687/88. General Louis Palma di Cesnola wrote in 1877 that the village relied on its production of halloumi. Around 2 million halloumis were produced each year in the caves around the village and exported to cities abroad such as Smyrna, Port Said and Alexandria. = Historical sites = * √áiftlikd√ºz√º - the Neolithic site could be the earliest settlement in Cyprus. Since 1998, the site has been excavated by archaeologists from T√úBƒ∞TAK and the Cyprus International University. It is dated to 8400 BC. The inhabitants were hunter-gatherers and circular adobe houses, as well as a small number of human bones, are among the artifacts found in the excavations. * Ancient city of Pergamon - the city is located to the east of Akanthou, between the rivers Trodia and Lukkos. It was established as a colony by the inhabitants of Pergamon in Asia Minor following the Trojan War. The city survived for over a millennium. It was frequently struck by pirate raids, and a tunnel was constructed that provided a way of escape to the sea. The raids were associated with mass rape of women and plunder, and the raiders would take away the women and the animals. The city was finally abandoned due to such a raid and the inhabitants moved to Akanthou. **Church of Panagia Pergaminiotisa in Pergamon - this was originally a large Byzantine church with three naves and three apses, but was destroyed in an earthquake or due to Arab raids in the 7th century. The present-day church was built in the 11th or 12th century. Its walls were filled with ornate frescoes, but these were stolen following the Turkish invasion in 1974; they were found in Germany in possession of the thief, Aydƒ±n Dikmen, in 1997 and returned. The church was restored in 2009.  Demographics  Tatlƒ±su municipality buildingDaily Kibris, 19 December 2014 New building of Tatlisu Municipality opened Historically, the village was predominantly populated by Greek Cypriots according to census data. The 1831 census, recorded the adult male population as 10 Turkish Cypriots and 163 Greek Cypriots. Around 1300 Greek Cypriots were displaced from the village following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The village was then chosen as the place of resettlement for the displaced Turkish Cypriots of Mari, but only 100 were resettled in the village as they mostly insisted on being closer to the cities. The village was nevertheless renamed Tatlƒ±su in 1975 after the Turkish name of Mari. The rest of the village was repopulated by Turkish farmers who were settled from areas such as Konya, Adana, Araklƒ±, Osmaniye, √áaykara, Kahramanmara≈ü and Gaziantep. In the 21st century, following the construction boom in Northern Cyprus, a number of Turkish Cypriots and Europeans also brought property in the village.

Smith led the efforts to create Canada‚Äôs modernized Consumer Product Safety Act and Chemicals Management Plan, which resulted in Canada becoming the first nation in the world to ban bisphenol A in children's products. With the United Steelworkers, he founded Blue Green Canada, the first permanent partnership between trade unions and environmental organizations in the country. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Socially and Environmentally Responsible Aggregate (SERA) initiative, the world‚Äôs first independently- certified sustainability standard for the global aggregate and concrete industry. Smith was one of the founders of the Strathmere Group. Since 2013, Smith has been Executive Director of the Broadbent Institute. Under his leadership, the Institute has become Canada‚Äôs pre-eminent progressive policy and training organization with offices in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. The Institute‚Äôs media project, PressProgress, is now Canada‚Äôs most- shared source of progressive news and analysis. Smith is also an advisor to Progress Toronto. The Broadbent Institute is the Canadian affiliate of the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS).  Books  Smith co- authored ‚ÄúSlow Death by Rubber Duck: How the Toxicity of Everyday Life Affects Our Health‚Äù (2009, Knopf Canada, re-issued 2019, Knopf Canada) and ‚ÄúToxin Toxout: Getting Harmful Chemicals Out of Our Bodies and Our World‚Äù (2013, Knopf Canada in Canada; St. Martin's Press in the U.S.) A Quill & Quire ‚ÄúBook of the Year‚Äù for 2009, ‚ÄúSlow Death by Rubber Duck‚Äù has been translated into seven languages, featured at the Sydney Writers‚Äô Festival, and by the Washington Post ( ‚Äúhard-hitting in a way that turns your stomach and yet also instills hope‚Äù), Dr. Oz, Fox News, and Oprah Magazine. In their two books, Smith and his co-author, prominent Canadian environmental expert Bruce Lourie, experiment on their own bodies, raising and lowering levels of toxic chemicals in their blood and urine through the performance of common activities. Their new experimentation in the 2019 re-issue of ‚ÄúSlow Death by Rubber Duck‚Äù has sparked a renewed debate on the presence of bisphenol A in consumer items. Smith‚Äôs research is featured in the award-winning documentary ‚ÄúToxic Beauty‚Äù and his self-experimentation for a feature on plastic pollution in The Globe and Mail resulted in his being one of the first people in the world, and the first in North America, to find microplastic particles in his body.  Personal  Smith currently lives in east-end Toronto with his wife Jennifer Story ‚Äì a Toronto District School Board Trustee ‚Äì and their two children.

After the discovery of the plot of Christopher Love, he went into exile in the Netherlands. Life He was born at Rainham, Norfolk in 1605. He was sent to Queens' College, Cambridge, by Sir Roger Townshend, 1st Baronet. After seven years at Cambridge, he studied theology at the house of Herbert Palmer, vicar of Ashwell, Hertfordshire. He was then for four years chaplain to Sir William Airmine, 1st Baronet of Orton, Northamptonshire, and in 1637 was presented by Sir Roger Townshend to the vicarage of Wivenhoe, Essex, where he persuaded his parishioners not to sell fish on Sunday. He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Jenkin, a preacher of Sudbury, and sister of William Jenkin, ejected in 1662. Seven years later he became minister of St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange, London. He joined in the declaration of the London ministers against the death of Charles, and preached a sermon before the mayor and aldermen at Mercers' Chapel on 25 Feb. 1649, when he prayed for the royal family and Charles II. He was brought before the council of state, and, refusing to recant, was committed to the Gatehouse Prison. He was released with other prisoners on 14 August 1649 as a thanksgiving for Michael Jones's victory at the Battle of Rathmines. He was concerned with his brother-in-law, William Jenkin, and others, in the plot to support Charles in Scotland, for which Christopher Love was executed on 22 August 1651, and escaped to Holland, where he was chosen pastor of the English church in Rotterdam. Here he became acquainted with scholars, and took pains to encourage Edmund Castell's Lexicon Heptaglotton and Brian Walton's polyglot bible. In 1658 Charles II addressed a letter to him, requesting Cawton to defend him among the Dutch ministers. Cawton died at Rotterdam on 7 August 1659. His son, Thomas Cawton the younger, was known as an orientalist.

It was released directly to DVD on November 10, 2009.  Plot  Summer (Ashley Greene) is hitchhiking along the side of the road when a man pulls over. He asks her where she's going, and she tells him; he says he's going through that town and that it was no trouble. Maybe, for this favor, she would do a favor for him. He expects Summer to pay him with giving him oral sex. Summer pulls out a gun and tells the driver to keep his eyes on the road. Summer is next seen in a gas station. Summer shoplifts food and accessories at a store in a small town. The sheriff (Paul Whitney) watches Summer from a distance. He approaches Summer, informing her that \\"people around here pay for their items.\\" Summer throws down a rack of store goods. She runs away. The sheriff falls over the rack. Summer runs outside. A young man Tom Hoxey (Peter Mooney) tells Summer to hide inside his truck. Summer is reluctant to accept Tom's offer, but he urges her to hurry up or else the sheriff will find her. Tom drives off with Summer. She asks Tom the reason he helps her to escape the sheriff. He claims the sheriff previously busted him for a drinking charge. At a local bar, the two of them have a few drinks. They chat about Summer's travels. Summer is obviously a confident girl who can take care of herself. Tom takes Summer back to his home. Summer discovers that Tom lives with his mom, Gaia (Barbara Niven). Tom is direct with Summer, so the two agree to go upstairs and have sex. As they are having sex, the audience then sees Gaia outside Tom's door, listening to him and Summer having sex. In the morning, Summer wakes up and puts her clothes on. She scavenges the kitchen, taking money from a jar. Tom enters the kitchen. He tells Summer she can stay. Summer is not interested. She tells Tom he was good last night, and that she wanted to avoid the awkward morning goodbye. Tom refuses to let Summer leave, continually telling Summer she can't leave. Summer pulls out a gun, threatening Tom to let her go or else she'll take action. Tom's mother Gaia smacks Summer on the back of her head with an object. Tom shows his mom that in his hand are the bullets to Summer's revolver, reassuring her that he had it under control. Summer is stored in the basement. A frail young woman Amber (Danielle Kind) is also held hostage; that the lack of sun is what's hurting Amber, not Tom. Tom tells Summer that he considers the basement as his garden. The girls make his garden look beautiful. The audience then discover Tom is a serial killer after he shows Summer a skull of a deceased girl. Summer says that he killed the girl, and Tom, angry, hits her, insisting he would never kill any of his girls. Amber's father Darwin is released from jail. He notices his home is a mess, and that there's rotten food in the fridge. Darwin asks the sheriff whether he has heard from Amber, saying that he heard around town that Amber was hanging around Tom. The sheriff is biased toward Darwin, dismissing him and telling Darwin that Amber probably left town for a while, as she had before. Summer tries to survive in the basement by antagonizing Tom. She is defiant toward Tom and his mother. When Summer and Amber are alone, Summer tells the weakened Amber to grab the tools hanging on the wall. Amber, at first, is delirious, not understanding what Summer means. Amber asks for \\"Daddy,\\" and Summer uses that to make Amber get up and limp toward the tools. Amber, weakened, falls on the ground, hits her head on a brick, and dies. Tom is pissed off that one of his girls died. He takes any deaths seriously. Tom's garden is special to him since his father locked him in the basement as a child that was where he first started growing his plats. Tom is told to get rid of Summer. His mother feels that keeping the garden is too dangerous since Darwin is snooping around town. Tom, angry, pins her to the table, forcing her to give in and say that he is right, before kissing her. She pushes him off, but touches herself after Tom leaves the room. Summer is left alone in the basement. Tom searches Amber's purse, finding an old picture and a journal, which forces Tom to realize that he only has one \\"garden angel\\" left. He gives Summer water, and when she behaves he unlocks Summer from the chains and gives Summer a bath upstairs. However, she tries to run again. After that, Tom and his mother search Summer's purse and find an old letter. Whatever it is, upsets Gaia, and she goes downstairs, pulling Summer's chin back and forth before giving Summer permission to work upstairs while Tom is home. She must stay in the basement when Tom and the mother are gone. Tom's father Gant Hoxey (Stephen McHattie) is on his way home, after calling that night that after she found the letter in Summer's purse. She sounds upset, he said, and he wants to know why. He realizes he has a surprise at home. Tom and Summer have sex again. Summer is obviously manipulating Tom, telling him she loved him when he told her to. The two talk about their future plans to leave. Tom wants to stay in the home, but Summer has other plans. The next day in a clothing shop that Gaia works in the sheriff informs Gaia that Darwin is worried about Amber's whereabouts. She tells the sheriff she hasn't seen Amber. Darwin asks Tom to stop by to help him on a stove since Tom is also a handyman. Tom agrees. Darwin asks Tom about Amber. He tells Darwin he hasn't seen his daughter in a couple months. Tom works on Darwin's oven. He tells Darwin that Amber must have left to watch a music band. Jessie (Cinthia Burke) is a local mechanic that is a witness to Tom being with Amber, telling Tom that Darwin had stopped by asking after his daughter and she mentioned seeing Amber with Tom. Tom decides to take Jessie hostage to prevent her from speaking to Darwin again. Tom is injured in the basement after Jessie, who he tied up, manages to get the ropes off her wrist and getting a knife from her ankle and stabs him on his leg. Tom asks Summer to give Jessie water. Jessie thinks Summer and the rest of the bunch are expecting her to become a sex slave. She agrees to do anything sexual, if only to survive. Summer begs Jessie to stay quiet, obviously scared for her. Jessie begs her not to leave her alone, but she's scared of Tom and goes back upstairs. The next day, after Darwin goes to Jessie's mechanic shop and finds Tom's handyman cards on the ground after Jessie rips his pocket, he drives to Tom's house. Summer attempts to escape as Darwin drives up to the front of the home. Summer enters Darwin's car, frantic about leaving the home right away. Darwin asks Summer if her daughter is in the home. Tom shoots a perfect shot, blowing apart Darwin's head. Summer runs out of the car. She tries to escape, but Tom shoots a shot next to her foot, and she pauses as Gaia pulls up, seeing the blood all over Summer and Darwin's car. Summer is restrained again in the basement, to Jessie. The father arrives home. He visits downstairs to see Summer. Gant tells Summer her mother never told him about her existence, telling her that her mother told him she miscarried Summer. Summer connects the dots and realizes that Gant is her father. She came looking for her father; however, she finds a monster. Gant guts Jessie, forcing Summer to watch, after he lets Summer go upstairs. The family have a cake. Tom defies his father, informing him he is not going to take Summer. Gant makes a joke that he is in love with his sister saying that \\"has a hard-on\\" for her. The next morning, as they're all sitting down for breakfast, Gant informs them that he's going to take Summer with him. Tom insists that he isn't, that Summer is going to stay with him. They fight, and Gant belittles him, calling him a \\"pussy\\" and throwing him into the next room. Tom walks out with a gun and threatens his father, asking if he's a man now. Gant takes the gun from Tom, shooting him to death. Summer is shocked. Tom's mother is saddened to see her son dead. Gant also shoots Gaia dead after she realizes, and says that it was Gant's plan all along - to get rid of his old family to make a new one. He tells her that she's right, and forces Summer to leave with him. Gant and Summer leave the home. They drive to a nearby park. Gant approaches a woman who is having a picnic. Summer walks up to her father and stabs him to death. The picnic woman screams, pleading Summer to not to kill her too. Summer tells the woman he was going to \\"kill you, and then me eventually.\\"http://www.plotspoiler.com/2012/02/summers-blood-movie-plot- spoiler.html  Cast   References   External links  * Category:2009 films Category:Incest in film Category:2009 horror films ","title":"Summer's Blood"},{"id":"23173022","text":"Taf√≠ del Valle (Tucum√°n): View from El Infiernillo Taf√≠ del Valle is a city in Tucum√°n, Argentina.

Moderate to severe earthquakes occur at approximately 30-year intervals.National Institute of Earthquake Prevention: historical earthquakes in Argentina (in Spanish) Among the most notable earthquakes to affect the region were those of 1861 and 1931. Civil Defence measures include: * an annual earthquake drill, * distribution of, and training around, a Manual of Disaster Procedures\\", ensuring that the media of communication are always provided with generator, facilities and transmission tower, * signs to warn that this is an earthquake-prone area. = Climate and ecology = Owing to the altitude, the prevailing climate is temperate with low humidity and winter snowfalls. The eastern part of the valley, where the town lies, is moist and consists of grassland with groves of conifers, deciduous trees and pepper trees. Further west there is less moisture, favouring the presence of scattered cacti such as the card√≥n. The contrast is particularly marked at Abra del Infiernillo, where just to the west one sees semideserts and deserts, while to the east lie grasslands, woods and forests often covered in cloud. The average maximum temperature in the town of Taf√≠ in summer (January) is 26C, while in winter (July) it's 16C, and temperatures down to -20C are common in the winter.  Toponymy  Taktikllakta (Cac√°n language: \\"Town of the magnificent entrance\\") seems to have been the original name of the population centre and of the valley in which it lies. The Spaniards simplified the name as Taf√≠. It should be borne in mind that Tucum√°n province contains another town with the name Taf√≠, viz. Taf√≠ Viejo.  History  Menhir, Taf√≠ culture, Museo de La Plata There have been native peoples in the area for over 7,000 years. Villages of farmers and gatherers were established 2,300 years ago, probably predating the Taf√≠ culture. The Spanish presence began in the mid-16th century. However, the Spanish were unable to establish themselves immediately, due to the resistance mounted by the native Diaguitas and in particular by the Calchaqu√≠ tribe. In 1636 the valley was granted as a royal gift (Sp: Merced Real) to the Spanish family of Leguizamo y Guevara, who founded an estancia (large rural estate). This was later bought by the Jesuits, who had been present in the area since 1617. The Jesuits introduced dairy farming, in particular the production of high-quality cheese.  Economy  The climate has favoured livestock farming, initially with camelids, and since the Spanish influx in the 16th century also with cattle, sheep, horses, and to a lesser extent goats. There is also cultivation of grain crops such as wheat, and vegetables such as lettuce. High-quality varieties of cheese are produced. The second half of the 20th century has seen development of tourism.  Tourism  Taf√≠ del Valle From 2003, this area has begun to be included in international package tours of northwest Argentina. The RP307 route from San Miguel de Tucum√°n to Taf√≠ goes into the Tucum√°n forest and passes through the Quebrada de los Sosa nature reserve. It passes three places of interest: the \\"El Indio\\" monument, \\"The Freezer\\" and \\"The End of the World\\". At the eastern entrance to the Taf√≠ valley is the village of El Mollar, which possesses a variety of tourist facilities, as also does the town of Taf√≠ del Valle. One of the main tourist attractions is the collection of menhirs at the Parque de los Menhires close to El Mollar. These phallic monoliths, some of them bearing still visible carvings, were shaped by the indigenous people of the Taf√≠ culture. Originally they stood at different locations throughout the valley, but under the provincial governorship of Antonio Domingo Bussi they were brought together at their present location, in order, it was said, to preserve them and protect them from damage by visitors. Very close to El Mollar, and extending towards Taf√≠ del Valle, is the artificial lake of Angostura. In addition to its setting among often snow-capped mountains, it offers attractions in the form of fishing and water sports. From this lake issues the fast-flowing and clear Los Sosa river, which flows eastward through canyons and over waterfalls. Less than 1 km from Taf√≠ is located the Jesuit centre of La Banda (built early 18th century, now a museum) and the hill of √ëu√±orco Grande. On Provincial Route 307, 2 km from the town, is the Casa Duende museum, dedicated to local beliefs, myths and traditions. Continuing to the north, there are panoramic views over the valley, and this route leads to Amaicha del Valle, the ruins of Quilmes, El Pichao, Colalao del Valle and Cafayate - the last-named is within the province of Salta and is well known for its high quality wines. Activities available at Taf√≠ include horse riding, tours in 4x4 vehicles, trekking, windsurfing, paragliding and visits to churches and estancias. = Annual events = * A re-enactment of the Passion of Christ during Holy Week, with local actors, attracting a larger number of spectators each year. * In summer, a tournament of the Argentine national sport of pato (an equestrian sport), involving sportsmen from all over the country. * The National Cheese Festival, held in February.  Population  In 2001 the town of Taf√≠ del Valle contained approximately 5,000 inhabitants, but in its role as departmental capital the quoted population includes that of settlements within approximately 15 km.  Gastronomy  The cheeses of Taf√≠, produced since the 18th century, are said to be of excellent quality. Also noted is the cottage cheese (quesillo) and a variety of preparations based on it, such as a dessert dish made with honey or cayote preserve; these may be served with kiwifruit or grapes. Other dishes available include roast meat ‚Äì beef or kid ‚Äì and especially grilled trout from the nearby lake, seasoned with lemon. Beverages include white Torront√©s wine, made in the neighbouring Calchaqu√≠ valleys, and beer brewed in San Miguel de Tucum√°n.

It is typically about 48‚Äì52% protein, 33‚Äì35% ash, 8‚Äì12% fat, and 4‚Äì7% water. It is primarily used in the formulation of animal feed to improve the amino acid profile of the feed. Feeding of MBM to cattle is thought to have been responsible for the spread of BSE (mad cow disease); therefore, in most parts of the world, MBM is no longer allowed in feed for ruminant animals. However, it is still used to feed monogastric animals. MBM is widely used in the United States as a low-cost animal protein in dog food and cat food. In Europe, some MBM is used as ingredients in pet food, but the majority is now used as a fossil-fuel replacement for energy generation, as a fuel in cement kilns, landfilling or incineration. MBM has around two thirds the energy value of fossil fuels such as coal; the UK in particular widely uses meat and bone meal for the generation of renewable electricity. This was particularly prominent after many cattle were slaughtered during the BSE crisis. Meat and bone meal is increasingly used in cement kilns as an environmentally sustainable replacement for coal. History Manufactured pelleted feed ration for sheep and goats In the UK, after the 1987 discovery that BSE could cause vCJD, the original feed ban was introduced in 1988 to prevent ruminant protein being fed to ruminants. In addition, it has been illegal to feed ruminants with all forms of mammalian protein (with specific exceptions) since November 1994 and to feed any farmed livestock, including fish and horses, with mammalian meat and bone meal (mammalian MBM) since 4 April 1996. Regulation (EC) No.999/2001 introduced EU-wide regulations, which relaxed UK controls. 30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v1.0. ¬© Crown copyright. In 2000, UK supermarket chain Co-op Food was still calling for \\"a legally- binding Europe-wide ban on the feeding of animal waste to farm animals\\". They opined that the practice was tantamount to cannibalism. According to the BBC at the time there was no ban on the use in livestock feed of animal blood, tallow, poultry offal and feather meal. = European categories = In Europe (before the 2002 EU Regulation), animal by-products were classified into two categories: \\"high risk\\" or \\"low risk\\" products. Since 2002, \\"processed animal protein\\" (PAP) and other animal by-products, authorized or not for various uses, are categorized into three categories (by the European Regulation 2002) according to their supposed or demonstrated level of health risk. #Category 1 material ‚Äì those that pose a prion infection risk to humans, including \\"SRM\\" (\\"specified risk material\\") and animals suspected or declared to be infected with prions.Enc√©phalopathies spongiformes transmissibles (parfois d√©nomm√©es Enc√©phalopathies spongiformes subaigu√´s Transmissibles ou ESST) ; famille de maladies neurod√©g√©n√©ratives des animaux incluant notamment l'ESB et la tremblante This category also contains products contaminated by certain banned substances (hormones) or dangerous for the environment (dioxins and dioxin- like compounds). #Category 2 materials ‚Äì associated with health risks other than prions or banned chemicals. Also includes foodstuffs seized for sanitary reasons and corpses of animals who died by other means than by being slaughtered, as well as products contaminated with residues of veterinary drugs. #Category 3 material ‚Äì from animals considered healthy and without specific risks, that is to say the carcasses have been declared fit for human consumption after health inspection. Only products in this category are allowed for the production of flours for animal feed (including pets). Detection Several manufactured pelleted feed rations for horses A minimum of 500g is required to test samples of solid or liquid material at the Irish Equine Centre, an independent not-for-profit organisation. Tests are by light microscopy and using real-time PCR for ruminant DNA. The presence of MBM and fish products in feed can be tested by light microscopy in two days. The presence of ruminant DNA in feed by real-time PCR can be detected by this lab in 48 to 72 hours.

Under the microscope, they appear spherical (cocci), and form in grape-like clusters. Staphylococcus species are facultative anaerobic organisms (capable of growth both aerobically and anaerobically). The name was coined in 1880 by Scottish surgeon and bacteriologist Alexander Ogston (1844‚Äì1929), following the pattern established five years earlier with the naming of Streptococcus. It combines the prefix \\"staphylo-\\" (from ), and suffixed by the Modern (from ). Staphylococcus includes at least 40 species. Of these, nine have two subspecies, one has three subspecies, and one has four subspecies. Many species cannot cause disease and reside normally on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and other animals. Staphylococcus has been found to be a nectar-inhabiting microbe. They are also a small component of the soil microbiome. Taxonomy The taxonomy is based on 16s rRNA sequences, and most of the staphylococcal species fall into 11 clusters: #S. aureus group ‚Äì S. argenteus, S. aureus, S. schweitzeri, S. simiae #S. auricularis group ‚Äì S. auricularis #S. carnosus group ‚Äì S. carnosus, S. condimenti, S. debuckii, S. massiliensis, S. piscifermentans, S. simulans #S. epidermidis group ‚Äì S. capitis, S. caprae, S. epidermidis, S. saccharolyticus #S. haemolyticus group ‚Äì S. devriesei, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis #S. hyicus-intermedius group ‚Äì S. agnetis, S. chromogenes, S. cornubiensis, S. felis, S. delphini, S. hyicus, S. intermedius, S. lutrae, S. microti, S. muscae, S. pseudintermedius, S. rostri, S. schleiferi #S. lugdunensis group ‚Äì S. lugdunensis #S. saprophyticus group ‚Äì S. arlettae, S. caeli, S. cohnii, S. equorum, S. gallinarum, S. kloosii, S. leei, S. nepalensis, S. saprophyticus, S. succinus, S. xylosus #S. sciuri group ‚Äì S. fleurettii, S. lentus, S. sciuri, S. stepanovicii, S. vitulinus #S. simulans group ‚Äì S. simulans #S. warneri group ‚Äì S. pasteuri, S. warneri A twelfth group ‚Äì that of S. caseolyticus ‚Äì has now been removed to a new genus, Macrococcus, the species of which are currently the closest known relatives of Staphylococcus. Two species were described in 2015‚ÄîStaphylococcus argenteus and Staphylococcus schweitzeri‚Äîboth of which were previously considered variants of S. aureus. A new coagulase negative species‚ÄîStaphylococcus edaphicus‚Äîhas been isolated from Antarctica. This species is probably a member of the S. saprophyticus group. =Subspecies= *S. aureus subsp. aureus *S. aureus subsp. anaerobius *S. capitis subsp. capitis *S. capitis subsp. urealyticus *S. carnosus subsp. carnosus *S. carnosus subsp. utilis *S. cohnii subsp. cohnii *S. cohnii subsp. urealyticus *S. equorum subsp. equorum *S. equorum subsp. linens *S. hominis subsp. hominis *S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus *S petrasii subsp. croceilyticus *S petrasii subsp. jettensis *S petrasii subsp. petrasii *S petrasii subsp. pragensis *S. saprophyticus subsp. bovis *S. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus *S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans *S. schleiferi subsp. schleiferi *S. sciuri subsp. carnaticus *S. sciuri subsp. rodentium *S. sciuri subsp. sciuri *S. succinus subsp. casei *S. succinus subsp. succinus =Groups= Based on an analysis of orthologous gene content three groups (A, B and C) have been proposed.Coates-Brown R, Moran JC, Pongchaikul P, Darby AC and MJ Horsburgh MJ (2018) \\"Comparative genomics of Staphylococcus reveals determinants of speciation and diversification of antimicrobial defense\\". Front Microbiol Group A includes S. aureus, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. lugdunensis, S. pettenkoferi, S. simiae and S. warneri. Group B includes S. arlettae, S. cohnii, S. equorum, S. saprophyticus and S. xylosus. Group C includes S. delphini, S. intermedius and S. pseudintermedius. =Notes= The S. saprophyticus and S. sciuri groups are generally novobiocin-resistant, as is S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus. Members of the S. sciuri group are oxidase- positive due to their possession of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. This group is the only clade within the staphylococci to possess this gene. The S. sciuri group appears to be the closest relations to the genus Macrococcus. S. pulvereri has been shown to be a junior synonym of S. vitulinus. Within these clades, the S. haemolyticus and S. simulans groups appear to be related, as do the S. aureus and S. epidermidis groups. S. lugdunensis appears to be related to the S. haemolyticus group. S. petrasii may be related to S. haemolyticus, but this needs to be confirmed. The taxonomic position of S. lyticans, S. pettenkoferi, S. petrasii, and S. pseudolugdunensis has yet to be clarified. The published descriptions of these species do not appear to have been validly published. Biochemical identification Assignment of a strain to the genus Staphylococcus requires it to be a Gram-positive coccus that forms clusters, has an appropriate cell wall structure (including peptidoglycan type and teichoic acid presence) and G + C content of DNA in a range of 30‚Äì40 mol%. Staphylococcus species can be differentiated from other aerobic and facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive cocci by several simple tests. Staphylococcus species are facultative anaerobes (capable of growth both aerobically and anaerobically). All species grow in the presence of bile salts. All species of Staphylococcus aureus were once thought to be coagulase- positive, but this has since been disproven.PreTest, Surgery, 12th ed., p. 88 Growth can also occur in a 6.5% NaCl solution. On Baird Parker medium, Staphylococcus species grow fermentatively, except for S. saprophyticus, which grows oxidatively. Staphylococcus species are resistant to bacitracin (0.04 U disc: resistance = < 10 mm zone of inhibition) and susceptible to furazolidone (100 Œºg disc: resistance = < 15 mm zone of inhibition). Further biochemical testing is needed to identify to the species level. When these bacteria divide, they do so along two axes, so form clumps of bacteria. This is as opposed to streptococci, which divide along one axis, so form chains (strep meaning twisted or pliant). =Coagulase production= One of the most important phenotypical features used in the classification of staphylococci is their ability to produce coagulase, an enzyme that causes blood clot formation. Seven species are currently recognised as being coagulase-positive: S. aureus, S. delphini, S. hyicus, S. intermedius, S. lutrae, S. pseudintermedius, and S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans. These species belong to two separate groups ‚Äì the S. aureus (S. aureus alone) group and the S. hyicus- intermedius group (the remaining five). An eighth species has also been described ‚Äì Staphylococcus leei ‚Äì from patients with gastritis. S. aureus is coagulase-positive, meaning it produces coagulase. However, while the majority of S. aureus strains are coagulase-positive, some may be atypical in that they do not produce coagulase. S. aureus is catalase-positive (meaning that it can produce the enzyme catalase) and able to convert hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water and oxygen, which makes the catalase test useful to distinguish staphylococci from enterococci and streptococci. S. pseudintermedius inhabits and sometimes infects the skin of domestic dogs and cats. This organism, too, can carry the genetic material that imparts multiple bacterial resistance. It is rarely implicated in infections in humans, as a zoonosis. S. epidermidis, a coagulase-negative species, is a commensal of the skin, but can cause severe infections in immunosuppressed patients and those with central venous catheters. S. saprophyticus, another coagulase-negative species that is part of the normal vaginal flora, is predominantly implicated in genitourinary tract infections in sexually active young women. In recent years, several other Staphylococcus species have been implicated in human infections, notably S. lugdunensis, S. schleiferi, and S. caprae. Common abbreviations for coagulase-negative staphylococci are CoNS, CNS, or CNST. The American Society for Microbiology abbreviates coagulase-negative staphylococci as \\"CoNS\\". Genomics and molecular biology The first S. aureus genomes to be sequenced were those of N315 and Mu50, in 2001. Many more complete S. aureus genomes have been submitted to the public databases, making it one of the most extensively sequenced bacteria. The use of genomic data is now widespread and provides a valuable resource for researchers working with S. aureus. Whole genome technologies, such as sequencing projects and microarrays, have shown an enormous variety of S. aureus strains. Each contains different combinations of surface proteins and different toxins. Relating this information to pathogenic behaviour is one of the major areas of staphylococcal research. The development of molecular typing methods has enabled the tracking of different strains of S. aureus. This may lead to better control of outbreak strains. A greater understanding of how the staphylococci evolve, especially due to the acquisition of mobile genetic elements encoding resistance and virulence genes is helping to identify new outbreak strains and may even prevent their emergence. The widespread incidence of antibiotic resistance across various strains of S. aureus, or across different species of Staphylococcus has been attributed to horizontal gene transfer of genes encoding antibiotic/metal resistance and virulence. A recent study demonstrated the extent of horizontal gene transfer among Staphylococcus to be much greater than previously expected, and encompasses genes with functions beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence, and beyond genes residing within the mobile genetic elements. Various strains of Staphylococcus are available from biological research centres, such as the National Collection of Type Cultures. Host range Gram-stained - numbered ticks on the scale are 11 ¬µm apart Members of the genus Staphylococcus frequently colonize the skin and upper respiratory tracts of mammals and birds. Some species specificity has been observed in host range, such that the Staphylococcus species observed on some animals appear more rarely on more distantly related host species. Some of the observed host specificity includes: *S. arlattae ‚Äì chickens, goats *S. aureus - humans'Staph Infection in Nose.' *S. auricularis ‚Äì deer, dogs, humans *S. capitis ‚Äì humans *S. caprae ‚Äì goats, humans *S. cohnii ‚Äì chickens, humans *S. delphini ‚Äì dolphins *S. devriesei ‚Äì cattle *S. epidermidis ‚Äì humans *S. equorum ‚Äì horses *S. felis ‚Äì cats *S. fleurettii ‚Äì goats *S. gallinarum ‚Äì chickens, goats, pheasants *S. haemolyticus ‚Äì humans, Cercocebus, Erythrocebus, Lemur, Macca, Microcebus, Pan *S. hyicus ‚Äì pigs *S. leei ‚Äì humans *S. lentus ‚Äì goats, rabbits, sheep *S. lugdunensis ‚Äì humans, goats *S. lutrae ‚Äì otters *S. microti ‚Äì voles (Microtus arvalis) *S. nepalensis ‚Äì goats *S. pasteuri ‚Äì humans, goats *S. pettenkoferi ‚Äì humans *S. pseudintermedius ‚Äì dogs *S. rostri ‚Äì pigs *S. schleiferi ‚Äì humans *S. sciuri ‚Äì humans, dogs, goats *S. simiae ‚Äì South American squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) *S. simulans ‚Äì humans *S. warneri ‚Äì humans, Cercopithecoidea, Pongidae *S. xylosus ‚Äì humans Clinical Staphylococcus can cause a wide variety of diseases in humans and animals through either toxin production or penetration. Staphylococcal toxins are a common cause of food poisoning, for they can be produced by bacteria growing in improperly stored food items. The most common sialadenitis is caused by staphylococci, as bacterial infections.

It aimed to retrain displaced workers and farmers in the banana/plantain industry and those whose jobs may disappear because of loss of preferential treatment in the European market. It was implemented in the six traditional banana-growing parishes: St. James, St. Catherine, St. Thomas, St. Mary, Portland and Clarendon. The project was a small-scale pilot. It did not provide jobs directly for people and was not used to influence changes to the banana/plantain sector, but its findings and outcomes were intended to help inform and develop a larger scale programme of assistance to workers in Jamaica's banana/plantain communities. What they learnt and the experiences of participants in the project were intended also to help inform the design of training and certification programmes to be implemented by HEART Trust/NTAhttp://www.heart-nta.org/index_flash.aspx (and/or other institutions) in the future.  History  The 15-month project began in October 2008 and ended in December 2009, at a cost of 354,700 euros, funded by the EU and HEART Trust/NTA. It consisted of continuous training needs analysis, career counseling workshops, pre-vocational, vocational skills and computer-based training. It taught participants modern skills for transition to new areas of employment or skills to improve banana productivity. The ultimate goal of the program was to ease participant‚Äôs uncertainty about their future and give them sustainable skill sets. A follow up phase two, designed from the results of the project, was planned for post December 2009 and was intended for a larger target group.  Project goals  * To understand the scale of the negative changes to Jamaica's banana and plantain communities * To find out which communities and individuals are impacted * To find out what skills and education the affected people have * To find out how training and development can help them earn a living  Project beneficiaries  People dependent on the banana/plantain producing industry: * Small Banana/Plantain Farmers * Banana/Plantain Workers * Port Banana/Plantain Workers * Immediate families of the above * Members in the above communities  Project activities  ;Career Counselling Workshops Workshops featured career counselling, motivational speeches and try-a-skill exercises where participants got a taste of skills such as housekeeping, construction and agricultural applications. ;Pre- vocational training programmes Focus on the employability skills of the participants in areas such as: communicating effectively in the workplace and working in a team. ;Vocational and Skills Training These were provided through existing programmes at HEART institutions or with partner institutions.

This company is known worldwide for its technology in regard to underwater exploration at great depths. Its line of business includes: * hyperbaric testing facilities, * oceanographic research ships (Minibex and Janus), * testing pool. COMEX carried out pioneering work in very deep saturation diving. The company experimented with the use of hydrogen in the divers' breathing gas. This work with heliox and hydreliox gas mixtures started with Hydra I in 1968. It culminated with Hydra X (Hydra 10) in 1992 when COMEX diver Theo Mavrostomos achieved a record simulated dive of in an onshore hyperbaric chamber.Technology: Dry run for deepest dive, New Scientist 28 November 1992 The use of hydrogen for diving was in part driven by the need to overcome the problems of high-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS). However, there was another reason for the interest in using hydrogen in a breathing gas. In 1987, Comex was part of a Canadian-French consortium that was building the world‚Äôs first commercial nuclear mini-submarine. This submarine, Saga, was a prototype intended to be used for oil exploration and development under the Arctic ice. Saga was built on a hull originally constructed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau but not completed due to lack of funds. Saga would have a complete saturation diving system on board. The nuclear power plant would be able to produce large volumes of hydrogen and oxygen through the electrolysis of water. This would provide plentiful amounts of breathing gas for autonomous diving operations under the Arctic ice cap. The project suffered tax problems in Canada which caused political repercussions between the French and Canadian governments. Saga did undergo successful sea trials in 1991 but without the intended nuclear power plant. Underwater propulsion was provided by a Stirling engine and surface propulsion by a diesel engine.IFREMER/COMEX Saga Submarine, World Technology Evaluation Center The project was abandoned and Saga was laid up at Marseille.

The Accidentals are typically anywhere from 12 to 17 members and hold auditions every fall and occasionally at the end of the spring  History  The Accidentals were formed in 1974 when the Director of The University of Georgia Men's University of Georgia Men's Glee Club, Dr. E. Pierce Arant, Jr. decided to liven up the concerts a bit by having a feature quartet. Over time the quartet grew to eight members, then twelve. In the mid-1980s Paul Tate joined the group and began to arrange more contemporary pop music for the group, a big change from the typical barbershop and spiritual music the group was used to doing with the Men's Glee Club. The Accidentals were widely heralded for their 1992 performance of \\"A Mighty Fortress\\" as arranged by the group Glad. Paul Tate took up the Directorship of the Accidentals in 1993 and proceeded to whip the 12 members into shape. That year also brought about a landmark event: the Accidentals' first album, On The Map, which was only available on cassette, and sold out quickly. The group put out their second album the next year: S.O.L.D. O.U.T. (Songs Of Liberty, Devotion, and Other Universal Truths). The album was a great improvement over On The Map and gave the Accidentals a more polished and professional sound. The next year brought the Accidentals' third album in three years: Songs From Uncle Paul's Cabin. In the spring of 1996, the Accidentals' first annual Invitational concert, UGAPALOOZA! The guest groups included The UNC Tar Heel Voices and The William & Mary Gentlemen of the College. In 1997 the Accidentals competed in their first a cappella competition, the southeast regional of The National Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (now the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella), and walked away with First Place, and a Best Arrangement Award for Paul Tate's \\"Blessing.\\" In January 2001 the Accidentals released their first Christmas album, Meanwhile, Back at Christmas..., which was recorded live at the Accidentals' Christmas Concert in Edge Recital Hall on December 2, 2000.http://www.uga.edu/accidentals/about.html Since 2000 the Accidentals have shifted their musical style away from their Glee Club origins towards a more contemporary pop sound, while also becoming completely student directed. They have been a continuous presence in Varsity Vocals International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, and have continuously grown and improved as competitors each year they competed, culminating with ICCA Finals appearances in 2010, where they received 3rd place overall, and 2012. The Accidentals have used their experiences and success in ICCAs to meet and connect with other a cappella groups around the country, and have frequently been guest groups at colleges all across the southeast and up the east coast. They have also released several pop albums over the years:PDA (Public Displays of A Cappella) (2000), None of the Above (2004), 14 and Change (2006), Imprint (2009), A Gentleman's Game (2011), and Tune Down For What (2014).

According to Palle Mellblom, who started the engine that day, Enoch Thulin was stressed by the successful demonstrations made by Sparmann the same year.

Armenochori means ‚ÄúArmenian village‚Äù in Greek. In 1958, the Turkish Cypriots adopted the alternative name Esenk√∂y, literally meaning ‚Äúwindy village.‚Äù History =Ancient= Tigranes the Great with four Kings surrounding him Armenochori is one of the oldest villages of Limassol District. Early signs of inhabitation is known to be dated to 85BC, when the emperor of Armenia named Tigranes the Great ( Tigran Mets; Tigr√°nes o M√©gas) had conquered Syria, Lebanon, parts of Israel, Anatolia and Cyprus. Part of Tigranes' army remained in Cyprus in order to guarantee the security of the Greek population of the island against aggressive Arabians. After continuing his achievements throughout the middle east, Tigran orders some of his leading military personnel to stay behind in the areas of modern Armenochori to monitor developments of agreements of protection of local Greek allies. The area of Armenochori was strategically convenient to watch over the Mediterranean horizon and stay alarm against possible invasions by enemies. Ancient history says: =Ottoman Period= The Kingdom of Armenia at its greatest extent under Tigranes the Great Armenochori/Esenk√∂y was turned into a Turkish Cypriot village during the Ottoman period. Although some Greek Cypriot and Armenian families lived there between 1891 and 1931, almost all of them left the village by the 1940s. Over the course of the British period, the population of the village doubled, rising from 89 persons in 1891 to 162 in 1960. =Modern= As a result of the Armenian Genocide under Ottoman Empire in early 1900s, Armenians from Adana, Ta≈üucu, and other coastal cities of Anatolia managed to escape to Cyprus and find refuge in their historic village. Today the village is the choice of residence of wealthy businessmen from Cyprus, Russia, Armenia and other countries. It has a population of 187 people.

However, that was changed by the most bitterly contested election in the country that year. Hunt ran a campaign ad connecting Helms to death squads in El Salvador through his association with the Nationalist Republican Alliance, for whom Roberto d'Aubuisson had recently run for the President of El Salvador.

It runs the BREW application platform on the Synergy operating system. Features The Krave is a revolutionary flip phone in that it is a touch screen phone which can be accessed from the phone's transparent cover, although with less accuracy and sensitivity than with it open. The earpiece speaker and speakerphone microphone is mounted in the middle of the cover, with no apparent connection to the phone. The \\"wires\\" are actually a fine mesh which is laminated into the cover. This red-colored mesh can be easily seen only in sunshine or other very bright direct lighting. Because this piece covers part of the 240√ó400 color LCD screen, some options of the camera and media player are not available with the cover closed, and this portion of the screen is blank black at those times. When closed, it effectively has a qVGA resolution of 240√ó320. The phone connects to 1xRTT voice and EV-DO data cellular networks. It also receives V Cast TV, Verizon's brand of mobile TV provided by MediaFLO. This is a pay TV service, and it cannot receive new free-to-air ATSC-M/H signals from local TV stations. Along with the TV service, a few other functions can be used with the cover closed, including VZ Navigator, the digital music player, and viewing or taking pictures and videos. If the Navigator icon is activated without the additional-cost subscription, it instead plays an audio/video advertisement for the service, and drains the lithium-ion battery by leaving the backlight on at the end until the user discovers it and exits the ad. The phone has 130MB of available flash memory on board, and takes microSD and microSDHC cards up to 8GB using a slot on the side, mounting it to on the phone's filesystem. Charging and data are via microUSB, while unprotected data (excluding ringtones due to Verizon lockdown) can be exchanged via Bluetooth. Also due to Verizon firmware, it cannot be connected as a standard mass- storage device or media player device. It has a 3.5mm TRS connector socket for standard headphones, and takes a TRRS connector (like the iPhone) for stereo headsets. The phone can also be operated in this manner, however loose connections can cause it to randomly stop, skip to another song, or even beep very loudly and redial without permission, even with a regular pair of headphones that does not have these features. There is also no setting available to defeat this behavior, which occurs even with the switch in the locked position. The music player plays MP3, AAC, AAC+, Enhanced AAC+, MIDI, and WMA 9 & 10, and displays album art. When closed, or when open in vertical mode, it has a progress bar that can be dragged through the song. When open in horizontal mode (left side down) it displays only album art, with three others tilted to each side, like the iPhone and iTunes. The song and album name are partly displayed, while the artist name is not displayed at all. Shuffle play is available, but the shuffle order is lost when exiting the player program, either accidentally or to use any other function except to receive an incoming call, or acknowledge a timed reminder. It also has a voice recorder which saves files in QCP format, which is unreadable by most computer software and must be converted manually to a standard format. Other features include voice command, and the ability to speak the name or phone number of contacts or incoming calls (caller ID). Bluetooth supports stereo headsets, file and vCard transfer, basic image printing, and other profiles. Camera phone The camera phone records pictures in JPEG format, but the Krave can also read GIF, PNG and BMP/DIB files. Thumbnails are stored individually as 9kB device- independent bitmap files (such as filename_jpg.dib, or filename_3g2.dib), occupying up to 10% more flash memory space (with 32kB clusters) than each picture itself (about 320kB at full size). The entire first video frame for each video is also stored this way (ff-filename_3g2.dib) at a resolution higher than the 320√ó240 of the video itself. Windows cannot read the thumbnails produced by the phone. Automatic creation of thumbnails can significantly slow browsing of photos. There is no way to bookmark, favorite, index, categorize, sort, or tag photos, such that the oldest ones require scrolling through all other photos taken since then. Large numbers of photos in the folder can cause severe slowness in capturing and browsing photos, and when a card is inserted or the phone reboots or is turned on. Although Exif data (in UTC rather than the local time zone) is recorded into each picture, the FAT32 filesystem's creation time is displayed as the file info. This information (along with the file-modified time) is destroyed if the file is moved between the phone and the card, causing pictures to appear out of order, as if taken at the time they were moved. Like other Verizon phones, filenames are recorded as MMDDYYhhmmx.jpg or .3g2, where x is the letter a, b, c, etc. Because the year is in the wrong place (the middle instead of the beginning where the most significant digits belong), the sort order appears wrong when viewed on a computer via a card reader, if there are pictures from a previous calendar year. Videos are recorded with MPEG-4 compression and stored in 3GPP2 (.3g2) format, but it will also play movies in the standard MP4 container format. All videos must not exceed 320√ó240 in size, and may be up to 30 frames per second. The default time limit is 20 seconds (keeping it under 500kB, small enough to be sent by MMS), but touching the lower-right icon changes this to one hour (free-space permitting). Pictures are up to 1600√ó1200 or 1200√ó1600 (\\"two megapixels\\", or exactly 1,920,000, also known as UXGA), with the \\"digital zoom\\" simply cropping the picture rather than interpolating it, and white balance and brightness still being determined from the entire field of view rather than only what is within the zoomed area. There is no zoom when viewing pictures or videos, and no way to edit them on the phone. =Orientation= Picture orientation is recorded such that photos (but not videos) are always right-side-up, and are cropped on their ends if being viewed in the opposite orientation from which they were taken. However, the phone only recognizes upright (portrait) and rotated onto its left side (landscape), and does not recognize right-side or upside-down orientation. When put this way or flat on a table, it uses the previously recognized orientation. When entering text messages (or any other text such as address book), the phone uses the standard dialpad and iTap when upright, while it uses a small QWERTY virtual keyboard layout while on its left side. The rotation function is controlled by an accelerometer. Reception Product reviews have been generally good for the phone, praising the innovative design, but lacking software features such as shortcuts or customization. One reason is Verizon does require many common user interface features to make phones they sell work in a similar fashion, which usually replaces the OEM's default software. Comments on radio reception have been positive, with many comparing Krave's ability to hold on to weak radio signals similar to the Motorola E815.

Background: GFIRST was formed because there was a need and desire to improve information sharing about cybersecurity incidents across federal government incident response teams. The focus was to create and environment in which the technical owners and operators could share there experiences with each other in a trusted environment. GFIRST evolved from a couple of earlier initiatives. Initially, there was a Task 1 initiative with the White House that focused on information sharing among a small group of incident response teams. The initial group was VA, IRS, DOE, and DOD. This group was successful in its initial information sharing efforts and the idea of G-CIRC was formed by the initial founders of the group (Rob Pate created the concept and eventually helped to launch GFIRST during the formation stage of DHS US-CERT). The GFIRST community grew like wildfire and the number of participants in the monthly DHS hosted meetings grew. The GFIRST community had the opportunity to make site visits to other incident response team around the nation to learn the best practices from others across government. In addition, the Annual GFIRT conference became a yearly gathering for the incident response community as well as many security leaders inside and outside of government. GFIRST always strived to keep the content rich, the community strong and focused, as well as deliver value to the security community. It was formed by a group of FIRST federal members (formed out of FEDCIRC) in 2003. GFIRST, hosted by US- CERT, is a community of more than 50+ incident response teams from various federal agencies working together to secure the federal government. Annual conference US-CERT hosts an annual GFIRST conference which is open to all interested in learning more about cyber security and incident response. GFIRST Conferences are a great place for public and private sector leaders serving in non-technical roles to become familiar with the fundamentals of cyber security and incident response. GFIRST is also an excellent resource for practitioners in incident response and information security from the public and private sectors.

Topology The Vienna Rectifier is a unidirectional three-phase three-switch three-level Pulse-width modulation (PWM) rectifier. It can be seen as a three-phase diode bridge with an integrated boost converter. Applications Fig. 2: Top and bottom views of an air-cooled 10kW-Vienna Rectifier (400kHz PWM). The Vienna Rectifier is useful wherever six-switch converters are used for achieving sinusoidal mains current and controlled output voltage, when no energy feedback from the load into the mains is available. In practice, use of the Vienna Rectifier is advantageous when space is at a sufficient premium to justify the additional hardware cost. These include: * Telecommunications power supplies. * Uninterruptable power supplies. * Input stages of AC-drive converter systems. Figure 2 shows the top and bottom views of an air-cooled 10 kW-Vienna Rectifier (400 kHz PWM), with sinusoidal input current s and controlled output voltage. Dimensions are 250mm x 120mm x 40mm, resulting in a power density of 8.5 kW/dm3. The total weight of the converter is 2.1 kg S. D. Round, P. Karutz, M. L. Heldwein, J. W.

Midpoint current of the output capacitors (i0 in Fig. 1). 5. Voltage between mains midpoint M and the output voltage midpoint 0. Note: Inner mains inductance is not considered, and therefore the voltage across the filter capacitors is equal to the mains voltage. Figure 3 shows the system behavior, calculated using the power-electronics circuit simulator.www.gecko-research.com Between the output voltage midpoint (0) and the mains midpoint (M) the common mode voltage u0M appears, as is characteristic in three-phase converter systems. Current control and balance of the neutral point at the DC-side It is possible to separately control the input current shape in each branch of the diode bridge by inserting a bidirectional switch into the node, as shown in Figure 3. The switch Ta controls the current by controlling the magnetization of the inductor. Switched on charges the inductor which drives the current through the bidirectional switch. Deactivating the switch increases causes the current to bypass the switch and flow through the freewheeling diodes Da+ and Da-. This results in a negative voltage across the inductor and drains it. This demonstrates the ability of the topology to control the current in phase with the mains voltage (Power factor correction capability). To generate a sinusoidal power input which is in phase with the voltage \\\\underline{i}_D = G \\\\star \\\\underline{u}_C \\\\approx G \\\\star \\\\underline{u}_1 the average voltage space vector over a pulse-period must satisfy: \\\\underline{u}_D\\\\star = \\\\underline{u}-j\\\\omega_1L_1\\\\underline{1}_D For high switching frequencies or low inductivities we require (L1) \\\\underline{u}_D \\\\star \\\\approx \\\\underline{u}_1. The available voltage space vectors required for the input voltage are defined by the switching states(sa,sb,sc) and the direction of the phase currents. For example, for iDa>0,iDb,iDc<0, i.e. for the phase-range \\\\phi_1 = -30^\\\\circ...+30^\\\\circ of the period(\\\\phi_1) the phase of the input current space vector is i_D \\\\approx i_1).

History Livonia - Livoniae nova descriptio, 1573 In the 15th century, a small settlement started to establish itself around the Kruonis' manor of the Grand Duke of Lithuania. The first church was built in Kruonis by Kazimieras Jogailaitis in 1472. It was built in the Catholic cemetery, using wood. Current Catholic church is located in the building which was built as a Uniate church in 1626 by the colonel of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, distinguished in the battles with the Muscovy, Cossacks and Livonia, subcamerarius of Trakai Teodoras Bohdanas Oginskis (1568‚Äì1640). It was a first Uniate church in Lithuania ‚Äì its architecture is a rare blend of the styles of Lithuanian Renaissance and Byzantine architecture. In 1628‚Äì1629, by the church a monastery of Basilian monks was established. In the beginning of the 17th century, the palatial Renaissance manor was built, but did not survive up to this day, except some ruins ‚Äì it was badly damaged in 1812 during Napoleonic Wars. The people of Kruonis were active participants of the January Uprising. Many of them after deported to the remote territories in Russia and were replaced by the colonists from Russia which were transferred to Kruonis. The Catholic church was closed in 1866 and demolished by Russian authority as a reaction to January Uprising. In the beginning of the 20th century cultural and social life revived ‚Äì a branch of Lithuanian Catholic Women Society (Lietuvi≈≥ kataliki≈≥ moter≈≥ draugija) established in 1913, Lithuanian spectacles were shown, Kruonis had a choir.

Geographical location  The village lies on state road 163 northeast of Bad Fallingbostel.  History  The first recorded mention of the village was around 1337. The name Vierde is derived from the four (vier) full-sized farms (Vollh√∂fen) that once formed the village of Vierde. Vierde was an agricultural village for centuries and, for the most part, still is today. Until the 19th century the keeping of Heidschnucken (moorland sheep) was the main source of income for the heath farmers. Only once the hardpan could be dealt with it was possible to cultivate crops, like grain and fruit trees, in order to generate new sources of income. Long established families are closely linked to the history and development of the village. The oldest surnames include: 1379: Ghogeue, 1438: Bode 1438: Niegemeiger, 1438: de rode Cordesche, 1438: Metteke, 1438: Detmer: 1438: Eggerdeschen stede woste, 1528: Hans Lethsemann, 1528: Cordt Pruschhagen, 1528: Cordt tom Kampe, 1528: Dirick 1528: Enmers, 1899: Oelfke. Large farms still bear witness to the development of these families today.  Culture and Landscape  Vierde The B√∂hme near Vierde As well as farming, the woods and the River B√∂hme, the B√∂hmeschlucht campsite, which is sited in the gorge of the same name, also stamps the character of Vierde. Vierde is located in the Heidmark, which was once the most beautiful part of the L√ºneburg Heath. Large parts of the Heidmark were turned into a military training area in 1935/36 (nowadays the largest of its kind in Europe, the Bergen-Hohne Training Area), and numerous villages disappeared from the map. The people of Vierde make an effort to work together to achieve cohesion, something which is seen as very important. The successful Adolphsheide-Vierde Shooting Club plays a significant role in bringing folk together.  The legend of the Hexenberg  The legend of the Hexenberg in Vierde has been passed down for generations. According to the legend: > A witch used to live in the Papenhaus. One day she died. She was to be > buried on the hill. So her coffin was loaded onto a cart. The horses sweated > under the load. At Leitzmann's they could go no further. Suddenly something > moved in the coffin. It was opened quickly and... a sow jumped out. Since then the hill has been called the Hexenberg (\\"witch's hill\\").

Hughes was the leader of the band, serving as lead singer and songwriter, and playing guitar and violin. The band are considered early artists in the Contemporary Christian movement. The band members of Lazarus met in college in Abilene, Texas. Initially, the band name was Shiloh. At a concert of Peter, Paul & Mary, they were able to meet Peter Yarrow backstage and play him their demo tape. In association with Yarrow and producer Phil Ramone, Lazarus moved to Peter Yarrow's cabin in Woodstock, N.Y., signing with the newly formed Bearsville Records (Warner Bros.) label, under the direction of Albert Grossman. The self-titled debut album Lazarus was the second album released on the Bearsville label. Released in 1971, this first album featured the single \\"Warmth of Your Eyes,\\" which became a moderate hit the following year. Their second and final album, A Fool's Paradise, followed in 1973, from which \\"Ladyfriends I (Sing a Song to Your Lady)\\" was tagged as a single. Both albums were produced by Yarrow and Phil Ramone. Over the next four years, Lazarus performed extensively throughout the United States and Canada. Lazarus was represented by the booking agency East-West Talent, Inc. who also represented The Band, Paul Butterfield, Foghat, Hello People, and Todd Rundgren. In 1976, the band won the Clio Award for Life Savers Best Commercial of the Year. The \\"Life Savers\\" TV commercial with the song written and performed by the band Lazarus ran nine years nationwide. The commercial starred Peter Billingsley and Suzanne Somers in different versions of the commercial, respectively. Following Lazarus' disbandment, Hughes went on to pursue a solo career and later formed a successful songwriting partnership with Roxanne Seeman. \\"Ladyfriends\\" from A Fool's Paradise was included in the Bearsville Anthology released in 2006.

The company was notable for being the sole bidder for the Dodge Viper.  Company  Founded in 2008 by entrepreneur Scott Devon, Devon Motorworks' stated focus is to undertake \\"multiple design projects that have a common purpose of providing sculptural power with recognizable beauty.\\" Devon's initial production vehicle, the Devon GTX super car, was scheduled to begin production in early 2010, however, economic downturn shelved production. Devon Motorworks made news for being the single bidder for Chrysler's Dodge Viper platform, originally intended to provide the basis for the Devon GTX. The bid was, however, rejected by Chrysler for being below the US$10.0 million reserve and with the fourth-generation Viper upon which the GTX was derived being discontinued, Devon Motorworks was closed.  Products  The initial product, Devon GTX, was unveiled in 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d‚ÄôElegance. The vehicle was conceived by Swedish designer Daniel Paulin and Devon Motor Works Founder Scott Devon, who shared a vision for an American supercar that combined classic and contemporary design cues. The distinguishing features of the Devon GTX included an aircraft-quality carbon fiber body, ‚Äúup and forward‚Äù articulating doors, two-tone wheel surrounds, minimal front/rear overhangs, dual center exhaust ports and carbon fiber racing seats. In validation testing, the vehicle set an unofficial lap record at California‚Äôs Willow Springs Raceway. Following subsequent testing, spy photos of the prototype appeared online. Product development for the Devon GTX was led by former Ford executive engineer Andy Benedict, while assembly and manufacturing was headed by Clive Hawkins, founder of the Aria Group. Aerodynamic testing was supervised by Dr. Joseph Katz, Chairman of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at San Diego State University. Vehicle validation and testing was handled by former 24 Hours of Le Mans champion Justin Bell. Two GTX cars were completed before production ceased, with one selling for $220,000 at a Barrett-Jackson auction in 2012.

In 2001, he joined Empoli, being protagonist of the Tuscans' successful 2001‚Äì02 Serie B campaign which saw the team being crowned league winners under head coach Silvio Baldini. He then played another season with Empoli, in his personal first (and only) Serie A season. In 2003, he followed Silvio Baldini at Palermo, who later won the Serie B title in 2003‚Äì04; he played only 17 league games out of 46 with the rosanero, being relegated to the bench after Silvio Baldini's dismissal from the head coaching post. =Coaching= After being released by Palermo in June 2004, Atzori chose to retire from football and instead focus in a management career, becoming Silvio Baldini's assistant at Parma. He then followed again Baldini also in his unsuccessful stints at Lecce (2005‚Äì06) and Catania (2007‚Äì08), both ended in his boss and mentor being sacked in mid-season. However, after Baldini was sacked from Catania in April 2008, Atzori decided instead to stay under new boss Walter Zenga. In June 2008 Atzori left Catania to accept a head coaching offer from Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Ravenna, a team where he had already spent four seasons as a player. He guided Ravenna through a very impressive season and qualification into promotion playoffs, where Ravenna was defeated by Padova in the semi-finals.

However, his time back at Catania lasted only fifteen games, as he was dismissed on 8 December due to poor results. On 16 June 2010 Serie B club Reggina announced Gianluca Atzori as the club's new head coach, replacing Roberto Breda. On 9 June 2011 Atzori was named as the new head coach of Sampdoria have been relegated to Serie B, signing a two-year contract. After a disappointing start of season, with Sampdoria in seventh place despite being tipped as one of the main direct promotion candidates during pre-season, Atzori was ultimately sacked on 13 November 2011. On 4 January 2013 he was named new coach of Spezia in Serie B en place of the sacked Michele Serena. His stint was however short-lived as he was sacked weeks later due to poor results and replaced by Luigi Cagni. In June 2013 he was named as the new head coach of Serie B club Reggina, thus marking a personal second stint of his at the Calabrian club. He was sacked in October 2013 and replaced by Fabrizio Castori, but reinstated in December 2013. He successively served as head coach of Serie B club Pro Vercelli from December 2017 to January 2018, in a short but unsuccessful stint in charge of the Bianche Casacche.

History  In 2000, the German national daily newspaper Die Welt published an article about the work of the theoretical physicist Markus Dahlem on the emergence of visual hallucinations during migraine. In the following days and weeks, the scientist received numerous letters asking for more information and many people were willing to provide additional information on their migraine symptoms. The obvious need for a wider public understanding of these visual hallucinations and further peculiar neurological symptoms suggested that a website devoted exclusively to migraine with aura would have a strong impact. It went online in 2000. This website was until 2004 available only in German. In 2004, the physician Klaus Podoll, an expert in migraine art, joined the project. The content presented on the website increased dramatically in the years 2004-2005. From 2004 on, it was published in a German and English version.

It ran for between an intersection with U.S. Route 4 in North Greenbush and a junction with NY 66 just inside the Troy city limits. In between, NY 405 intersected NY 136\\\\. The entirety of NY 405 was originally part of NY 40\\\\. In the February-March 1973, NY 40 was truncated northward to NY 7 in northern Troy and its former routing from US 4 to NY 66 was assigned NY 405\\\\. Ownership and maintenance of most of NY 405 was transferred to Rensselaer County on April 1, 1980, at which time the parts of the route given to the county were redesignated as part of County Route 74 (CR 74). Route description NY 405 began at an intersection with U.S. Route 4 in North Greenbush. It headed eastward and northeastward on Winter Street through a residential area to an intersection with NY 136\\\\. At the time, the intersection was the western terminus of NY 136\\\\. NY 405 continued northeastward into the city of Troy, where it ended at a junction with NY 66 in the extreme southeastern corner of the city. History NY 40 initially extended south of Troy to East Greenbush when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. All of NY 40 from 125th Street in Troy southward was concurrent to U.S. Route 4. By 1932, NY 40 was rerouted south of Troy to leave US 4 at Winter Street and follow the street through North Greenbush and into Troy. At the end of Winter Street, NY 40 turned northwest, overlapping NY 66 into downtown Troy. The overlap between US 4 and NY 40 from East Greenbush to North Greenbush was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY 40 was truncated northward to the junction of US 4 and Winter Street. NY 40 originally overlapped with NY 7 through northern Troy and NY 66 out of the city. As part of numerous changes by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in February-March 1973, a new alignment would have NY 40 run down Oakwood Avenue to Hoosick Street in Troy, ending there. In response, a new route was created on the former alignment along Winter Street, designated as NY 405. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 405 from US 4 through its junction with NY 136 to the Troy city line was transferred from the state of New York to Rensselaer County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The portions of NY 405 transferred to the county were redesignated as part of CR 74 while Williams Road became part of a westward extension of NY 136. Maintenance of Winter Street in the city of Troy remained the responsibility of the city of Troy, as it had been during NY 405's existence.

The Neurosciences Institute (NSI) was a small, nonprofit scientific research organization that investigated basic issues in neuroscience. Active mainly between 1981 and 2012, NSI sponsored theoretical, computational, and experimental work on consciousness, brain-inspired robotics, learning and memory, sensory processing, and motor control. NSI was founded by Nobel Laureate Gerald M. Edelman in 1981 in New York City. It remained an active research center until shortly before his death in 2014. In 1993 NSI moved to San Diego, California‚Äîfirst into temporary quarters and then, in 1995, into a newly constructed complex on the campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). Designed by the firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, the three- building complex received much acclaim for its Modernist style and especially for an auditorium that became a favored venue for music and performing arts in the area. In October 2012, plagued by financial problems and as part of a sharp contraction in its research efforts, NSI moved into leased space in an office building in the village of La Jolla, several miles from its old location. Its former home, including the auditorium, formally became part of TSRI. The Institute's size varied considerably over the years of its existence. At its peak, it included three dozen Ph.D.-level research scientists (called \\"Fellows\\") and a comparable research support staff. Following the 2012 contraction, fewer than half a dozen Ph.D.-level research scientists remained. This number dwindled in the year preceding Edelman's death.  History  NSI was established in 1981 as an independent entity on the campus of The Rockefeller University in New York City. In founding the Institute, Edelman argued that the quest for fundamental understanding of brain functions was being impeded, at most existing institutions, by artificial barriers between scientific disciplines and by a reward structure that favored modest, incremental research rather than high-risk, high-payoff research. Edelman claimed that he would be able to break from this reward structure by securing private, unrestricted funding for research at NSI. However, he was mostly unsuccessful at this and NSI struggled financially throughout its existence. In its very early years, NSI sponsored conferences, workshops, and other activities for visiting scientists; these programs were generally organized around a focused research problem. More than 1000 scientists from 300 institutes and 24 countries visited the Institute over its first two decades. NSI's financial problems in the decade before its 2012 contraction curtailed these activities, save for the Neurosciences Research Program meetings (see below). In 1988, NSI began its own program of research in theoretical and computational neurobiology. Carried out by a small group of resident Fellows, the program was designed to develop biologically-based theories of higher brain functions. In 1993, following its relocation to San Diego, NSI added a program of experimental research, which would eventually include molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral studies and would utilize flies, rodents, non-human primates, and humans. In 2012, severe financial problems forced NSI to vacate its San Diego complex, reduce its computational programs, and shut down its experimental and theoretical programs entirely. The three buildings constituting its former home were ceded to TSRI. What remained of NSI was housed, in the year immediately preceding Edelman's death, several miles away in rented office space in the La Jolla business district.  Architecture  Between 1995 and 2012, NSI occupied a three-building complex located on Torrey Pines Mesa in San Diego. It was bordered by TSRI to the west, the Sanford-Burnham Institute to the north, the University of California, San Diego to the south, and numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical research companies to the east and in the immediate surrounding area. Following NSI's 2012 restructuring, the buildings were taken over by TSRI. NSI commissioned the buildings in the early 1990s. Edelman has said that, in selecting an architect, his goal was to find one who could realize his vision of a \\"scientific monastery\\" where creative study of the brain could be conducted with few constraining rules and unlimited opportunities for communication. The resulting complex, designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, has been awarded numerous honors, including the Honor Award for Architecture from the American Institute of Architects in 1997. The structural engineering firm chosen for this project was Severud Associates. One of the complex's three buildings is an auditorium designed to accommodate both scientific lectures and musical concerts. Noted acoustician Cyril Harris worked with the architects to create the 352-seat auditorium. Considered to be among the most acoustically impressive small performance halls in the United States, the auditorium was built with an original system of faceted, sound- dispersing plaster panels that cover its walls and ceiling, so that the same sound can be heard in every seat.  Neurosciences Research Program (NRP)  Though it was founded in 1981, NSI traces its origin to 1962. It was in that year that a small group of scientists from diverse backgrounds began to meet regularly to discuss basic ideas about how the brain works. Their motivation was the idea that traditional barriers between different scientific disciplines had to be broken down if complex brain functions were ever to be understood. Led by Francis O. Schmitt, this informal collection of research scientists was organized as the Neurosciences Research Program (NRP) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Over the next two decades, and through over 250 meetings and 125 scientific publications, the NRP developed innovative formats for intellectual exchange and disseminated knowledge to the worldwide scientific community. The central group today exists as an honorary society, whose members number no more than 36 at any one time and serve seven- year terms. Over the past four decades, 17 Nobel laureates have been members of the NRP. The Neurosciences Institute itself developed from the NRP as an independent institution on the campus of The Rockefeller University in New York in 1981. The NRP moved from Boston to New York in 1983, and became part of the Institute when it moved to San Diego in 1993.

It was first published in 1989 as the first hymnal for The United Methodist Church after the 1968 merger of The Methodist Church with The Evangelical United Brethren Church. The 960-page hymnal is noted for many changes that were made in the lyrics of certain hymns, so as to modernize the hymnal. History Prior to the release of The United Methodist Hymnal, The United Methodist Church used the hymnals that were in use by The Methodist Church and The Evangelical United Brethren Church at the time of the merger. The Methodist Church generally used The Methodist Hymnal, also known as The Book of Hymns, or a 1982 supplement, while The Evangelical United Brethren Church had its own hymnal, The Hymnal, which was first published in 1957, and other congregations sometimes used special hymnals oriented to different nationalities. The release of United Methodist Hymnal in 1989 followed the updates of several other denominational hymnals in the previous decade, such as Lutheran Book of Worship in 1978 and the Episcopalian The Hymnal 1982. The United Methodist Hymnal was developed by a revision committee composed of twenty-five members led by editor Carlton R. Young (who also edited The Methodist Hymnal), and chaired by Bishop Rueben P. Job. It was the first hymnal following The Methodist Church's merger with The Evangelical United Brethren Church. In selecting and arranging hymns, many that contained masculine pronouns were altered so as to include gender-neutral pronouns instead. Male references to God, such as \\"Master\\", \\"Father\\" and \\"King\\", were retained, and a hymn entitled \\"Strong Mother God\\" was rejected. The editors had also considered eliminating militaristic references, and in 1986 the hymnal revision was the subject of controversy as the editors had considered eliminating \\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\" and some verses of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" but retained both hymns after receiving more than 11,000 protest letters. The line \\"white as snow\\" was changed to \\"bright as snow\\" in \\"Nothing but the Blood of Jesus\\", so as to eliminate the imagery of black and white respectively being images of sin and redemption. A line in \\"O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing\\" containing references to blindness, deafness and muteness was marked with an asterisk to indicate that it may be omitted. Several international hymns were also selected, including Spanish, Asian and American Indian hymns, as well as Black spirituals. Duke Ellington's \\"Come Sunday\\" was also included. In compositions by John Wesley, many of the lyrical changes made by his brother Charles were reverted, and most uses of \\"thee\\" were replaced with \\"you\\". The hymnal also contains four forms of the Holy Communion ritual, known as the Service of Word and Table, and also of the Baptismal Covenant, along with several musical settings for both of those services. It also contains the marriage and funeral rites, forms for morning and evening Praise and Prayer, and a Psalter based on the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible but with a few revisions. Before the hymnal's official release, The United Methodist Publishing House sent a 73-page sampler to several churches. More than three million copies were sold by July 31, 1989, and the total was over four-and-a-half million ten years later. Two supplemental hymnals have been issued, The Faith We Sing in 2000, and Worship & Song in 2011. There are two other equally official hymnals of The United Methodist Church: Mil Voces Para Celebrar: Himnario Metodista (published in 1996) and Come, Let Us Worship: The Korean-English United Methodist Hymnal (published in 2000).The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church 2008, ¬∂1114.3 See also *List of English-language hymnals by denomination External links * HymnSite.com - United Methodist Hymn Resources (Unofficial Resource) References Category:Protestant hymnals Category:United Methodist Church Category:1989 books Category:1989 in Christianity Category:1989 in music ","title":"The United Methodist Hymnal"},{"id":"23174162","text":"Sunnyside is a former settlement in Mendocino County, California.

The algorithm has important applications in the layout of digital circuits and components in VLSI. Description The input to the algorithm is an undirected graph with vertex set , edge set , and (optionally) numerical weights on the edges in . The goal of the algorithm is to partition into two disjoint subsets and of equal (or nearly equal) size, in a way that minimizes the sum of the weights of the subset of edges that cross from to . If the graph is unweighted, then instead the goal is to minimize the number of crossing edges; this is equivalent to assigning weight one to each edge. The algorithm maintains and improves a partition, in each pass using a greedy algorithm to pair up vertices of with vertices of , so that moving the paired vertices from one side of the partition to the other will improve the partition. After matching the vertices, it then performs a subset of the pairs chosen to have the best overall effect on the solution quality . Given a graph with vertices, each pass of the algorithm runs in time . In more detail, for each a \\\\in A, let I_{a} be the internal cost of a, that is, the sum of the costs of edges between a and other nodes in A, and let E_{a} be the external cost of a, that is, the sum of the costs of edges between a and nodes in B. Similarly, define I_{b}, E_{b} for each b \\\\in B. Furthermore, let :D_{s} = E_{s} - I_{s} be the difference between the external and internal costs of s. If a and b are interchanged, then the reduction in cost is :T_{old} - T_{new} = D_{a} + D_{b} - 2c_{a,b} where c_{a,b} is the cost of the possible edge between a and b. The algorithm attempts to find an optimal series of interchange operations between elements of A and B which maximizes T_{old} - T_{new} and then executes the operations, producing a partition of the graph to A and B.

The muscles within the calf correspond to the posterior compartment of the leg. The two largest muscles within this compartment are known together as the calf muscle and attach to the heel via the Achilles tendon. Several other, smaller muscles attach to the knee, the ankle, and via long tendons to the toes.  Etymology  From Middle English calf, kalf, from Old Norse kalfi, possibly derived from the same Germanic root as English calf (‚Äúyoung cow‚Äù). Cognate with Icelandic k√°lfi (‚Äúcalf of the leg‚Äù). Calf and calf of the leg are documented in use in Middle English circa AD 1350 and AD 1425 respectively. page 20 Historically, the absence of calf, meaning a lower leg without a prominent calf muscle, was regarded by some authors as a sign of inferiority: it is well known that monkeys have no calves, and still less do they exist among the lower orders of mammals. page 311 Structure The calf is composed of the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg: The gastrocnemius and soleus (composing the triceps surae muscle) and the tibialis posterior. The sural nerve provides innervation. Clinical significance Medical conditions that result in calf swelling among other symptoms include deep vein thrombosis page 229 compartment syndrome, Achilles tendon rupture, and varicose veins. Idiopathic leg cramps are common and typically affect the calf muscles at night. Edema also is common and in many cases idiopathic. In a small study of factory workers in good health, wearing compression garments helped to reduce edema and the pain associated with edema. A small study of runners found that wearing knee-high compression stockings while running significantly improved performance. The circumference of the calf has been used to estimate selected health risks. In Spain, a study of 22,000 persons 65 or older found that a smaller calf circumference was associated with a higher risk of undernutrition. In France, a study of 6265 persons 65 or older found an inverse correlation between calf circumference and carotid plaques. Calf augmentation and restoration is available, using a range of prosthesis devices and surgical techniques  Training and Exercise The calves can be isolated by performing movements involving plantarflexion (pointing the toes down). The two major categories of calf exercises are those that maintain an extended knee, and those that maintain a flexed knee. The first category includes movements such as standing calf raises, donkey calf raises and stair calves. The second category includes movements that maintain a bent knee, such as seated calf raises. Movements with a straight knee will target the gastrocnemius muscle more, and movements with a bent-knee will target the soleus muscle more. However, both variations will target both muscles to a large degree. As the calf muscles are predominantly slow-twitch, they should be trained in a moderate to high repetition range. All repetition ranges offer their own benefits, and as such, calf training should be done in the 5-10 repetition range, the 10-20 repetition range, and the 20-30 repetition range. It is important to train the calves relatively close to failure, which is 0-4 repetitions away from technical failure. They recover quickly, often requiring rest times of as little as 10 seconds and often no more than 60 seconds. Ensuring a 1-2 second pause at the top and bottom of the movement will put more emphasis on the muscle, and less emphasis on the achilles tendon.

The epic poem Der W√§lsche Gast (original: Der welhische gast, \\"The Romance stranger\\") is the only preserved work by him. Life Thomasin's ancestry remains obscure. The noble Cerclaria dynasty from Cividale was among the ministeriales in the Patria del Friuli (Patriarchate of Aquileia), an ecclesiastical Imperial State in Italy. From about 1206 he was a canon of the cathedral chapter under Patriarch Wolfger von Erla, the former Bishop of Passau, who had already been a patron of Walther von der Vogelweide and Albrecht von Johansdorf. The title w√§lsch/welsch (walhaz) refers to himself, as his mother tongue was Italian (or Friulian) and he apologizes in advance for any linguistic inadequacies. The poem has about 14,750 lines and is written in the Middle High German language with distinct Bavarian elements. According to Thomasin's own accounts he put it down within ten months in 1215/16. The poem became exceptionally popular and is rendered by 24 preserved medieval illuminated manuscripts. It seems that the miniature illustrations were also conceived by Thomasin himself. The text is aimed at young nobles lecturing on courtesy, courtly love (minne), and chivalry, based on contemporary scholastic works on ethics, philosophy, and the liberal arts. The adoption of (Bavarian) Middle High German by a non-native speaker is a valuable contemporary source for linguistic researchers.

Plot During the Second World War, Sir Edward Norton of British Counterintelligence informs politician Goodenough that all he knows about a German spy in possession of vital information is that he or she is on the ship Santa Maria, bound for Lisbon. However, there is some good news; Sir Edward receives a coded message from the ship's captain, informing him that Lloyd Harrigan, one of his most resourceful agents, is also aboard. Despite being a neutral, the ship is torpedoed. Six passengers make it to a lifeboat, three men (Robert Cooper, Thomas Pettifer and Toni Anzoni) and three women (Gillian Chase, Mrs. Lindley and Diane Winters). They pick up Oberleutnant Hartzmann, the commander of the now-sunk U-boat, and soon after, reach a lighthouse manned by Sutton and his assistant Ernie. Hartzmann manages to send a message before disabling the wireless, and finds a pistol. Holding the others at gunpoint, he informs them that another U-boat will pick him up in about five hours. He also tells them that he sank their ship because he knew that both Harrigan and the German spy were passengers, and that, based on Harrigan's reputation, the spy would not have reached Lisbon. However, he does not know either person's cover identity. Nobody admits to being either agent. Eventually, Sutton obtains another gun and takes Hartzmann prisoner, handcuffing him and locking him in a room. However, someone passes the keys to Hartzmann's handcuffs and the door, and leaves a revolver outside. Hartzmann shoots the wireless Sutton has repaired and takes control again. Then Cooper turns up dead, struck in the head. Finally, when Hartzmann announces the U-boat has arrived, Pettifer reveals he is the spy. However, Hartzmann then informs him he is Harrigan, not the unfortunate Cooper. British, not German, naval personnel take Pettifer away.

Its forerunner was created by statute in 1974. The Institute produced over 30 plays and musicals for family and school audiences, and provided a theatre-arts school, summer programs, and internships. The company toured within New York State and abroad. The Institute closed in 2010 following a State enquiry into alleged irregularities. History In 1974, the New York State Legislature enacted legislation creating the Empire State Youth Theatre Institute (ESYTI) under the guardianship of The State University of New York.

The institute later moved to the Troy campus of Russell Sage College. NYSTI was the first state mandated theatre education program for children in the United States.McCaslin, 1987, p. 132. The Theatre Institute's programs were piloted in 1975 at Lake Avenue Elementary School in Saratoga Springs, New York and at the Empire State Plaza MeetingRoom 6. The program officially began in September 1976 and continued on an 11-month basis until December 31, 2009. Following financial difficulties and an official enquiry into alleged nepotism and misuse of funds, the institute closed at the end of 2010. Mission NYSTI's mission was fourfold: 1) to produce professional theatre of the highest artistic standards for family and school audiences; 2) to use those productions to provide provocative and innovative arts in education programs; 3) to exchange theatre, culture, and humanity with the people and artists of other nations; and 4) to develop new plays and musicals for family audiences. Methods and educational programs Performers, technicians, staff, and guest artists used theatre to motivate school students to find new interest in their daily subjects. The Institute's educational services included Pre-Show Intros and Study Guides, Inservices, inter-disciplinary classes following performances, educational outreach programs, a Theatre Arts School, summer theatre programs, and an extensive intern and educator-in-residence program. All members of NYSTI's professional staff participated in educational programs. Internships Internships provided school-to-work transition experience for high-school seniors as well as college undergraduate and graduate students from schools in New York and other states, as well as from other countries. Each intern was assigned a mentor from the professional staff to guide and assist the intern. More than 1,500 interns from more than 90 colleges, high school seniors, and thirteen foreign nations worked and studied at NYSTI. International exchange The Institute always maintained a commitment to international cultural exchange beginning with the tour of ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù to Moscow in 1974 by the troupe from the State University of New York at Albany whose leadership later founded the Institute. In 1986, the Institute became the first theatre company from the United States to perform in the former Soviet Union upon resumption of cultural relations between the two countries. The company returned to Russia in 1989 and twice hosted visits to the United States by the Moscow Musical Theatre. NYSTI also represented its state and nation in cultural exchanges with Canada, England, France, Israel, Italy, Sweden and Jordan, including a month-long performance run in London's West End. NYSTI hosted more than thirty foreign artists or companies from such places as Russia, Israel, Jordan, Sweden, Scotland, Hungary, England, France, Canada, and Japan. New plays and musicals Eight of NYSTI's premieres were accepted for licensing and publication by Samuel French Inc., the world's largest publisher of plays. Among NYSTI's count of more than forty-five premiere productions were William Gibson's ‚ÄúRag Dolly,‚Äù which toured to Moscow in 1986 (a later version opened on Broadway as Raggedy Ann) and Paul Shyre's ‚ÄúHizzoner!,‚Äù starring Tony Lo Bianco, which won five Emmy awards in a WNET/13 co-production and later played on Broadway before touring to Moscow in 1989. The New York and East Coast premiere of Jeffrey Sweet's ‚ÄúAmerican Enterprise,‚Äù was nominated by the Outer Critics Circle for its 1994 John Gassner Playwriting Award and chosen for special citation in The Best Plays of 1993-1994. Warner Music Group awarded NYSTI $400,000 in 1996 to develop five new musicals for family audiences. The first of those was ‚ÄúA Tale of Cinderella‚Äù by W.A.Frankonis, Will Severin, and George David Weiss, made possible in part by funding provided by Warner Music Group and by the participation of Warner/Chappell Music, Inc. Warner Bros. Publications also published ‚ÄúVocal Selections from ‚ÄòA Tale of Cinderella‚Äô.‚Äù The video was broadcast nationwide on PBS stations. In the 2000-01 season, ‚ÄúA Tale of Cinderella‚Äù toured all the major cities of New York including Buffalo, Syracuse, the Capital Region, and Manhattan. Other new musicals developed with the Warner Music Group grant were ‚ÄúThe Silver Skates,‚Äù ‚ÄúMagna Carta,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Snow Queen‚Äù (which toured to London‚Äôs West End and won numerous awards for its audiobook). National touring In addition to its tour of ‚ÄúA Tale of Cinderella,‚Äù NYSTI toured its education programs and performances to New York City, with productions of Institute originals ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast,‚Äù and new stagings of ‚ÄúNarnia‚Äù and ‚ÄúSlow Dance on the Killing Ground.‚Äù The theatre company also performed at the Kennedy Center, Ford's Theatre, Queens Theatre in the Park, the Fulton Opera House, and the Honolulu Theatre for Youth. Audio books In later years, NYSTI, through Family Classic Audio, began producing audio books. Ten of its titles won awards from five national presenters in all kinds of genres: musicals, mysteries, and dramas.

Controversy Several years of budget cuts preceded an investigation ordered by the Executive branch of government. The investigation went on for over a year and led to a report by the New York State Inspector's Office, issued in April 2010, alleging corruption, mismanagement, nepotism and possibly illegal conduct at the theatre. It claimed that the Producing Director improperly used state money to pay herself and her family, and to subsidize trips to Europe.\\"NYSTI head's hiring, spending blasted\\", Troy Record, April 21, 2010.

The refinery processed oil produced at the Lance Creek Oil Field, which produced a paraffin-based high gravity \\"sweet\\" (low-sulfur) oil that could easily be processed through simple means. The Ohio Oil Company controlled the field and piped its product to markets in the U.S. Midwest.

Using salvaged equipment from the defunct Pennsylvanian Belgo-American Refinery in Casper, Chamberlain and his partner James Hoblit built their refinery in 1933 in Lusk on a site. Some of the equipment used by the C & H had been made as early as 1886. Chamberlain sold his interest to Hoblit in 1935 and used the proceeds to buy the Ranger Hotel in Lusk.

It was a single-engined two-bay, two- seat biplane powered by a 400 hp (298 kW) Lorraine-Dietrich engine. Two were completed in 1923, but showed poor performance due to being overweight. A modified aircraft, the Type 10 Model A flew in 1924, showing only slight improvement, while a further revised prototype, the Model B flew in 1925, this curing the aircraft's weight problems while demonstrating better stability and control. As a result, several pre-production Type Bs were built. Although the Type 10 was not adopted by the Japanese Navy, it was again redesigned, reducing the wingspan from 16.16 m (53 ft 0¬º in) to 13.99 m (45 ft 11 in) and reducing the empty weight from 1,912 kg (4,215 lb) to 1,660 kg (3,659 lb). In this form, the revised design was accepted in January 1926 as the Type 14 Reconnaissance Seaplane, later receiving the short designation E1Y. Two versions entered service in 1926, a two-seater powered by a Lorraine-Dietrich 1 V-12 engine, the Type 14-1 or E1Y1, and a three-seater with all-metal floats and a more powerful Lorraine-Dietrich 2 W engine. In 1928, the Type 14-2 was used as the basis for the Type 90-3 Reconnaissance Seaplane, of which about 20 were built as the Yokosuka E5Y1 and Kawanishi E5K1. As the Type 90-3 showed little improvement over the Type 14-2 from which it was developed, in 1931, Yokosuka developed the further refined Type 14-3 Reconnaissance aircraft, with a new tail, a geared Lorraine-Dietrich 3 engine and significantly improved performance. A total of 218 E1Y1 and E1Y2s were built by Yokosuka (23), Nakajima Aircraft Company (47) and Aichi (148). 102 E1Y3s were built by Aichi. Operational history The E1Y1 and E1Y2 entered service in 1926, replacing Yokosuka Ro-Go Ko-Gata and Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 seaplanes, with the E1Y3 following them into service from 1931. The E1Ys formed the main reconnaissance seaplane equipment of the fleet, operating from battleships and seaplane tenders. E1Ys were operated from the seaplane tender Notoro during the Shanghai Incident of early 1932. The E1Y remained in use until the early part of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Many E1Ys were sold as civil aircraft from 1932, usually converted with a cabin for three or four passengers. Some were fitted with Napier Lion engines.

Joubert officiated in domestic first class matches in South Africa since 2003, in matches in the Vodacom Cup and Currie Cup competitions. He refereed on the World Rugby Sevens circuit in 2003‚Äì04. He has been included in the Super Rugby refereeing panel since 2005 and has also refereed international test matches since 2005, making his debut in a match between the United States and Wales. Joubert took charge of Super Rugby finals in 2010, 2013 and 2014 and has officiated in Tri-Nations / Rugby Championship matches since 2009, refereeing matches between Australia and New Zealand in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013. In the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Joubert refereed four pool games, a quarter final, a semi-final and the final. He refereed the deciding Six Nations match in 2012 and one of the British and Irish Lions games on their tour to Australia in 2013. He took part in four pool games at the 2015 Rugby World Cup and the quarter final match between Scotland and Australia. During that quarter final, he was criticised for incorrectly awarding a penalty to Australia in the final minutes, which Australia converted to win the match 35‚Äì34, and for rushing off the field at the end of the match. He retired from refereeing 15-a-side matches at the end of 2016 to take up a role as a Referee Talent Development Coach at World Rugby. Early career Joubert was born in 1977 and attended Maritzburg College and then the University of Natal to study business finance. Joubert took up refereeing in 1995 as a teenager, when he was encouraged to do so by his father Des, who was also a referee at provincial level. He initially worked in corporate banking for a period of five years, before deciding to take up full-time refereeing, becoming a member of the Kwa-Zulu Natal Rugby Referees' Society. 2003‚Äì05 In 2003, Joubert officiated in several first class matches in domestic South African competitions, appearing in the Vodacom Cup and Vodacom Shield at the start of the year before taking charge of matches in the Currie Cup qualifying rounds, the First Division and eventually in the Premier Division of the Currie Cup when he took charge of the match between the Griquas and the Pumas in Kimberley. After the domestic season, Joubert joined the 2003‚Äì04 World Sevens Series circuit. He returned to domestic action for the 2004 Vodacom Cup and 2004 Currie Cup competitions and was named on the South African refereeing panel for the 2005 Super 12 season. He officiated at his first Super 12 match in Sydney when the New South Wales Waratahs beat the Chiefs 25‚Äì7 in the opening round of the competition. Two more appearances followed ‚Äì again in Sydney as the Waratahs faced the Crusaders and in Dunedin where the Highlanders hosted the Waratahs. He officiated his first test match in June 2005, when he took charge of a match between the United States and Wales in Connecticut, before again officiating in the South African domestic Currie Cup competition, where he refereed the First Division final between the Falcons and the Pumas. 2006‚Äì11 He refereed a further five matches in the 2006 Super 14 season ‚Äì which included his first appointment to a match played in South Africa in the trans-Jukskei derby between the Bulls and the Cats ‚Äì and in domestic action in the 2006 Currie Cup Premier Division. He refereed in both those competitions throughout 2007 and 2008, and also took charge of the promotion/relegation play-off match between the Boland Cavaliers and the Griffons. After taking charge of seven matches in the 2009 Super 14 season, he refereed the British and Irish Lions' match against the Golden Lions during their tour of South Africa. He took charge of both matches between New Zealand and Australia hosted in New Zealand in the 2009 Tri Nations Series, as well as the 2009 Currie Cup First Division final between the Pumas and the SWD Eagles. In 2010, Joubert was in charge of several Super 14 matches including being appointed as the referee for the final between the Bulls and the Stormers in Soweto. He once again took charge of a match between Australia and New Zealand in the 2010 Tri Nations Series and was appointed to officiate the final of the 2010 Currie Cup Premier Division between the and Western Province in Durban. He refereed several matches during the 2011 Super Rugby season, including the semi-final match between the Stormers and the Crusaders in Cape Town. He also had a further appearance in the 2011 Tri Nations Series, officiating the New Zealand versus Australia match in Auckland. =2011 Rugby World Cup= He was named on the refereeing panel for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and took charge of four matches during the pool stage of the competition. He also officiated the Quarter Final match between Ireland and Wales, the semi-final between Australia and New Zealand and the final between New Zealand and France, in the process becoming the youngest referee ever to officiate a final. Joubert was publicly criticised by French players Dimitri Yachvili, Dimitri Szarzewski and Maxime Mermoz for his performance in the final. Gerry Thornley, writing in The Irish Times, was of the opinion that France was the better team on the night, with Joubert being reluctant to award penalties against New Zealand in the last quarter of the match. Sir Clive Woodward was of the same opinion 2012‚Äì15 In 2012, Joubert took charge of the 2012 Six Nations Championship match ‚Äì and Grand Slam decider ‚Äì between Wales and France and was also involved in the very start of the 2015 Rugby World Cup qualifying tournament, as he officiated the first match between Mexico and Jamaica in the Americas qualification tournament. He again officiated during the Super Rugby, including taking charge of the semi-final match between the Chiefs and the Crusaders. He made one appearance in the 2012 Rugby Championship in the Argentina versus Australia match in Rosario and took charge of the Currie Cup promotion/relegation play-off match between the and the Free State Cheetahs. Craig Joubert refereeing the Brumbies vs Bulls 2013 Super Rugby semi-final. After officiating in seven matches during the 2013 Super Rugby season, Joubert was put in charge of a match between Samoa and Italy in a quadrangular tournament held in South Africa and also the second test match between the British and Irish Lions and Australia during the 2013 tour series. When the Super Rugby season resumed after the international break, Joubert was appointed to referee the semi-final match between the Bulls and the Brumbies and also the final a week later, as the Chiefs hosted the Brumbies in Hamilton. He again took charge of an Australia versus New Zealand clash in the 2013 Rugby Championship and in domestic rugby in the 2013 Currie Cup Premier Division, as well as the Currie Cup promotion/relegation play-off match between the Pumas and the Griquas. He officiated fifteen matches in the 2014 Super Rugby season, which included his second consecutive final as the Waratahs hosted the Crusaders in Sydney, where again he come under criticism for a late penalty he awarded in favour of the Waratahs giving them the win. The following day Joubert contacted both Crusaders Coach Todd Blackadder and Crusaders Captain Richie McCaw to apologise, announcing to both that he got the final call wrong. Joubert officiated the Argentina versus New Zealand match in the 2014 Rugby Championship in La Plata. He refereed several matches in the 2014 Currie Cup Premier Division, including the final between Western Province and the Golden Lions. At the conclusion of the 2015 Super Rugby season, World Rugby announced that Joubert would return to the World Sevens Series for 2015‚Äì16, in an attempt to earn a selection to officiate at the rugby sevens event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. =2015 Rugby World Cup= He was named on the refereeing panel of the 2015 Rugby World Cup and took charge of four matches during the pool stage of the tournament. He was also appointed to officiate the quarter final between Australia and Scotland, which Australia won 35‚Äì34. However, Joubert's decision to award a last minute penalty to Australia \\"provoked outrage\\" among Scotland supporters ‚Äì as well as former players like Andy Nicol and Matt Dawson ‚Äì after replays showed that Joubert had awarded the penalty erroneously. Scotland wanted Joubert to refer the incident to the television match official (TMO); but he was prevented from doing so by TMO protocol. Following a review of the referee's performance, World Rugby stated that Joubert should not have awarded the penalty. However, this public review of Joubert's performance also attracted criticism from figures within the game, such as Australia coach Michael Cheika and former player David Campese. In addition, Joubert was also criticised by former Scottish captain Gavin Hastings and former Scotland winger Kenny Logan for rushing from the field immediately after the match ended, rather than shaking hands with the players and fellow officials, as is the tradition. 2016 After his spell officiating in the 2015‚Äì16 World Rugby Sevens Series, Joubert was included on the list of referees that would take charge in the Rugby sevens at the 2016 Summer Olympics. He also remained active in the fifteen-man version of the sport, officiating in the 2016 Super Rugby season. In May 2016, he was appointed to officiate the versus match, his 100th appearance in the competition. He retired from refereeing 15-a-side matches at the end of 2016 to take up a role as a Referee Talent Development Coach at World Rugby. While the job would mainly consist of developing younger referees, he would continue to referee on the World Rugby Sevens Series.

Prince's own composition, \\"The Barbary Rag\\", was recorded by the band in 1913.Ragtime, p. 290. Prince's Band was the first to record many compositions that became jazz standards. Their version of W. C. Handy's \\"Saint Louis Blues\\" in 1915 is the first known recording of the song. It took the band two sessions to record a successful take, which was considered unusual considering the talent of the band and its leader.Lost Sounds, p. 416. Another song by Handy, \\"The Memphis Blues\\", was recorded by Prince's Band in 1914, a week after its first recording by the Victor Military Band.Jazz Standards on Record, pp. 48‚Äì49. Other standards introduced by the band are Porter Steele's \\"High Society\\" (1911)Jazz Standards on Record, p. 28. and Lew Pollack and Ray Gilbert's \\"That's a Plenty\\" (1914).Jazz Standards on Record, p. 82. His band also played the popular instrumental \\"Too Much Mustard\\" released by Columbia and Sears's Oxford Records. Prince recorded as a solo celeste player under the name Charles Adams. As such, his recording of \\"Silver Threads Among the Gold\\" was popular. At Columbia, Prince also showed initiative in expanding the company's \\"classical\\" orchestral catalogue and in experimenting with the size of ensembles that acoustic recording equipment could capture. In October 1910 he conducted an abbreviated version of Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 in B Minor, popularly known as the Unfinished Symphony, on two sides of a 12-inch disc (released as Columbia A 5267), which was the first orchestral recording of any part of a symphony. He assembled a 90-piece orchestra to record the overture to Richard Wagner's opera Rienzi in February 1917 (released as Columbia A 6006YouTube digitisation with images of labels stating number of players. The piece is cut by about one-third.), which was the largest ensemble commercially recorded to that date. Prince's last recording for Columbia was in 1922. He then changed labels to Puritan Records and later to Victor Records, where he worked as associate musical director. Prince was related to the U.S. presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams.

October 12, 2006. = Democratic Republic of the Congo = Deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been caused partly by unregulated logging and mining, but mostly by the demands made by the subsistence activities of a poor population. In the east of the country, for example, more than 3 million people live less than a day's walk from Virunga National Park. Wood from the park's forests is used by many of those people as firewood, as lumber for construction, and in the production of charcoal. Deforestation caused by subsistence living is an acute threat to the park in general, and to the habitat of the critically endangered mountain gorilla in particular.These deforesting activities have been amply documented by numerous authors (Accion contra el Hambre, 1999; Biswas & Tortajada-Quiroz, 1996; Fuelwood Crisis Consortium, 1994; Henquin & Blondel, 1996; Lodhi et al., 1998; Blondel, 1997; Leusch, 1995; and Languy, 1995). From 2014 to 2018 the rate of tree-felling in the Democratic Republic of Congo has doubled. = Ethiopia = The main cause of deforestation in the East African country of Ethiopia is a growing population and subsequent higher demand for agriculture, livestock production and fuel wood.Sucoff, E. (2003). \\"Deforestation\\". Environmental Encyclopedia. pp. 358-359. Detroit: Gale. Other reasons include low education and inactivity from the government,Mccann, J.C. (1999).

(2006). Sub-Saharan Africa: An environmental history. Santabarbara, CA: ABC-CLIO. Organizations such as Farm Africa are working with the federal and local governments to create a system of forest management.Parry, J. (2003). Ethiopia, the third largest country in Africa by population, has been hit by famine many times because of shortages of rain and a depletion of natural resources. Deforestation has lowered the chance of getting rain, which is already low, and thus causes erosion. Bercele Bayisa, an Ethiopian farmer, offers one example why deforestation occurs. He said that his district was forested and full of wildlife, but that overpopulation caused people to come to that land and clear it to plant crops, cutting all trees to sell as firewood.Haileselassie, A. Ethiopia's struggle over land reform. World press Review 51.4 (April 2004):32(2). Expanded Academic ASAP Ethiopia has lost 98% of its forested regions in the last 50 years. At the beginning of the 20th century, around 420,000 km¬≤ or 35% of Ethiopia's land was covered with forests. Recent reports indicate that forests cover less than 14.2% or even only 11.9% . Between 1990 and 2005, the country lost 14% of its forests or 21,000 km¬≤. = Kenya = In 1963 Kenya had forest cover of some 10 percent; by 2006 it had only 1.7 percent. = Madagascar = DeforestationSaving the Wildlife of Madagascar, TIME, September 25, 2008 with resulting desertification, water resource degradation and soil loss has affected approximately 94% of Madagascar's previously biologically productive lands. Since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90% of its original forest. Most of this loss has occurred since independence from the French, and is the result of local people using slash- and-burn agricultural practices as they try to subsist. Largely due to deforestation, the country is currently unable to provide adequate food, fresh water and sanitation for its fast growing population. = Nigeria = According to the FAO, Nigeria has the world's highest deforestation rate of primary forests. It has lost more than half of its primary forest in the last five years. Causes cited are logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of fuel wood. Almost 90% of West Africa's rainforest has been destroyed. Asia = Russia = Russia has the largest area of forests of any country on Earth, with around 12 million km2 of boreal forest, larger than the Amazon rainforest. Russia's forests contain 55% of the world's conifers and represent 11% of biomass on Earth. It is estimated that 20,000 km2 are deforested each year.Russia‚Äôs Boreal Forests WWF November 2007 The present scale of deforestation in Russia is most easily seen using Google Earth. Areas nearer to China are most affected, as it is the main market for the timber. Deforestation in Russia is particularly damaging as the forests have a short growing season due to extremely cold winters and therefore will take longer to recover. = Southeast Asia = Forest loss is acute in Southeast Asia,\\"China is black hole of Asia's deforestation\\", Asia News, March 24, 2016 the second of the world's great biodiversity hot spots.SE Asia faces 'catastrophic' extinction rate, BBC News According to a 2005 report conducted by the FAO, Vietnam has the second highest rate of deforestation of primary forests in the world, second to only Nigeria. More than 90% of the old-growth rainforests of the Philippine Archipelago have been cut. Other Southeast Asian countries where major deforestation is ongoing are Cambodia and Laos. According to a documentary by TelePool, the deforestation is being directed by corrupt military personnel and government (forestry services).  Cambodia   Indonesia  , at present rates, tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged out in 10 years, Papua New Guinea in 13 to 16 years.China is black hole of Asia's deforestation, Asia News, 24 March 2008. Indonesia had lost over 72% of intact forests and 40% of all forests completely in 2005. Illegal logging took place in 37 out of 41 national parks. The illegal logging costs up to US$4 billion a year. The lowland forests of Sumatra and Borneo were at risk of being wiped out by 2022. According to Transparency International, numerous controversial court decisions in this area have raised concerns about the integrity of the judiciary.  Malaysia   Philippines   Thailand   Vietnam  = Japan = Yoichi Kuroda sketches a history and current outline of 'large scale land and landscape destruction' here See also Mudslides and Erosion. = Sri Lanka = Europe Europe has lost more than half of its forests in the past 6,000 years. This has primarily been due to agricultural expansion and demand for wood fuel. According to satellite data, the loss of biomass in EU‚Äôs forests increased by 69% in the period from 2016 to 2018, compared with the period from 2011 to 2015.Countryside of central Sicily =Finland= =Iceland= Iceland has undergone extensive deforestation since Scandinavians settled in the ninth century. At the time of human settlement about 1140 years ago, birch forest and woodland covered 'at least 25%' of Iceland's land area. The settlers began by cutting down the forests and burning scrubland to create fields and grazing land. Deforestation did not end in Iceland until the middle of the 20th century. Afforestation and revegetation has restored small areas of land. However, agriculture was the main reason birch forest and woodland did not grow back. =Italy= Sicily is an oft-cited example of man-made deforestation, practiced since Roman times, when the island was made an agricultural region, and continued to this day. This gradually aridified the climate, leading to decline of rainfall and drying of rivers. Today, the entire central and southwest provinces are practically without any forests. This has also affected Sicily's wild fauna, of which little is left in the island's pastures and crop fields. =Russia= North America =Canada= Though replanted in 1987, this forest near Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia lost much topsoil and resembled a desert by 1993 In 2005, an estimated 56,000 hectares were deforested in Canada. Deforestation affected less than 0.02% of Canada‚Äôs forests in 2005. The agricultural sector accounted for just over half of the deforestation in 2005, the result of forests having been cleared for pasture or crops. The remainder was caused by urban development, transportation corridors, and recreation (19%); hydroelectric development (10%); the forest sector (10%); and other natural resource extraction industries (8%). About two thirds of this deforestation occurred in Canada‚Äôs boreal forest, mainly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba where the forest borders the Prairies. In Canada, prior to 2000, less than 8% of the boreal forest was protected from development and more than 50% has been allocated to logging companies for cutting.Global Forest Watch Canada 2000. Canada's Forests At A Crossroads ‚Äî An Assessment in the Year 2000  British Columbia  =United States= Clearcutting in Clatsop County, OregonIn 1600, prior to the arrival of European-Americans, roughly half of the land area of the present-day United States was forest‚Äîabout . For the next 300 years land was cleared, mostly for agriculture, at a rate that matched the rate of population growth. For every person added to the population, one to two hectares of land was cultivated. This trend continued until the 1920s when the amount of crop land stabilized in spite of continued population growth. As abandoned farmland reverted to forest, the amount of forestland increased from 1952, reaching a peak in 1963 of . Since 1963 there has been a steady decrease of forest area with the exception of some gains from 1997.  Central America and the Caribbean  The history of most Central American countries involves cycles of deforestation and reforestation. By the fifteenth century, intensive Mayan agriculture had significantly thinned the forests. Before Europeans arrived, forests covered 500,000 square kilometers ‚Äì approximately 90% of the region. Eventually, the forcing of \\"Europe's money economy on Latin America\\" created the demand for the exportation of primary products, which introduced the need for large amounts of cleared agricultural land to produce those products.Myers, Norman, and Richard Tucker. \\"Deforestation in Central America: Spanish Legacy and North American Consumers.\\" Environmental Review: ER 11, no. 1 (1987): 55-71. Since the 1960s, cattle ranching has become the primary reason for land clearing. The lean grass-fed cattle produced by Central American ranches (as opposed to grain-fed cattle raised elsewhere) was perfectly suited for American fast-food restaurants and this seemingly bottomless market has created the so-called \\"hamburger connection\\" which links \\"consumer lifestyles in North America with deforestation in Central America\\". =Haiti= South America =Amazon Rainforest= Brazil There is no agreement on what drives deforestation in Brazil, though a broad consensus exists that expansion of croplands and pastures is important. Increases in commodity prices may increase the rate of deforestation.Amazon rainforest threatened by new wave of oil and gas exploration, guardian.co.uk, August 13, 2008 Recent development of a new variety of soybean has led to the displacement of beef ranches and farms of other crops, which, in turn, move farther into the forest. Certain areas such as the Atlantic Rainforest have been diminished to just 7% of their original size. Although much conservation work has been done, few national parks or reserves are efficiently enforced. Some 80% of logging in the Amazon is illegal. In 2008, Brazil's government announced a record rate of deforestation in the Amazon. Deforestation jumped by 69% in 2008 compared to 2007's twelve months, according to official government data. Deforestation could wipe out or severely damage nearly 60% of the Amazon rainforest by 2030, according to a 2007 report from WWF.\\"More than half of Amazon will be lost by 2030, report warns\\", guardian.co.uk, December 6, 2007 =Colombia= =Peru= Oceania =Australia= Due to relatively recent colonisation, Australia has had high rates of deforestation, primarily due to clearing for agricultural purposes. In recent years much of the clearing has occurred in Tasmania and Queensland. Australian Greenhouse Office 2000, Land Clearing: A Social History, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra. In 2007, rates were expected to decrease with the implementation of new legislation. Forest Practices Authority. (2007) Information on land clearing controls in Tasmania. WWF-Australia. World class legislation - new land clearing policy for Queensland In 1998, deforestation is thought to have been responsible for around 12% of Australia's total carbon emissions. An additional factor currently causing the loss of forest cover is the expansion of urban areas. Littoral rainforest growing along coastal areas of eastern Australia is now rare due to ribbon development to accommodate the demand for seachange lifestyles. Vast amounts of logging continue in Australia despite the devastation of the Black Summer Bushfires in 2019-2020. =New Zealand= In the 800 years of human occupation of New Zealand 75% of the forests were lost. Initially it was by wholesale burning by the British but remaining forests were logged for lumber for the burgeoning population. By 2000 all logging of native trees on public land was stopped. Logging on private land is controlled with a permit system and with the Resource Management Act. =Papua New Guinea= Papua New Guinea (PNG) has one of the world‚Äôs largest rainforests.

It is the second spin-off television series of the film Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, as well as a spin-off of The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius. The series was picked up for 26 episodes by Nickelodeon for its first and only season. Jeffrey Garcia returned as the voice of Sheen, and Bob Joles and Rob Paulsen are the voices of Nesmith and Doppy. The series was originally animated by C.O.R.E. in Toronto, but animation production moved to Bardel Entertainment in Vancouver after C.O.R.E closed down. At that time Chris Neuhahn took over as Supervising Producer. Planet Sheen premiered on Nickelodeon on October 2, 2010 (along with T.U.F.F. Puppy) in the United States. The series aired its final episode on February 15, 2013. Plot After sneaking into Jimmy's laboratory and finding his new rocket ship, Sheen accidentally blasts himself into outer space when he disobeys Jimmy's warning note (\\"Sheen, do not press this button\\") and presses the button Jimmy mentioned in his note. 4,000,001 lightyears away, Sheen crashes on Zeenu an planet inhabited by the alien race of Zeenunians. Soon after the crash, Sheen wants to go home, but his rocket ship was smashed when he flew into a house belonging to an evil Zeenunian sorcerer named Dorkus. Dorkus (who was one of the chief advisers to the Emperor) is furious that Sheen destroyed his home, and stole his job as supreme royal advisor from him, and intends to destroy him alongside his minion Pinter. Unfortunately, the Emperor takes a liking to Sheen and thwarts his plans at every turn. Much of the show is centered around Sheen fixing his rocket, working for the Emperor and annoying Dorkus with his antics and wild destruction, and Dorkus trying (and failing) to get back at him for it. While on Zeenu, Sheen makes many new friends, some of which include Doppy Doppweiler (a green, slug-like creature who resembles Carl), the Emperor (the grand head ruler of Zeenu, who firmly believes Sheen is a supernatural creature that will bring joy to Zeenu), Nesmith (an intelligent chimpanzee from Earth who excels in subjects such as math and engineering), Princess Oomlout (the emperor's daughter who develops a crush on Sheen, which he does not appreciate), and a Zeenunian girl named Aseefa who becomes Sheen's crush and knows how to yodel. Aseefa has a pet Choctow (the most feared and dangerous monster on Zeenu) named Chock Chock. Development During production of The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius, much of DNA Animation were pitching new titles for development if the show were to end. From this, Keith Alcorn and Mike Gasaway developed \\"Red Acres\\", which would've been a cgi series about an adult astronaut who finds a planet filled with dimwitted aliens. They and Ben Gilberg pitched the idea to Nickelodeon in New York City, who loved it, but refused to greenlight it because it went against Nickelodeon's rule of the main character not being a child. They then pitched the concept to Kids WB, Cartoon Network, and Disney, yet got rejected each time. They then redeveloped their main character so that instead of focusing on an adult, they focus on Carl and Sheen from Jimmy Neutron. However after presenting their idea, an executive for Nick said that the series shouldn't focus on Carl, just Sheen. Though it was hard for the team to fully accept, they reached a compromise by introducing an alien character who looked and acted just like Carl. After pitching the idea to Nickelodeon Animation in LA, they loved the show so much, that it was put into immediate development, with Steven Banks joining the crew to help develop the show even further.http://www.gasmangroup.com/blog/2015/05/30/day-275-red- acres-aka-planet-sheen/ Broadcast Planet Sheen premiered in the United States on Nickelodeon on October 2, 2010, and continued to air there until August 2011.

It is one of the oldest museums in the Balkans.Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade . The Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade fulfills its mission together with the efforts of various stakeholders in the domain of presentation, revitalization and development of crafts in Serbia.  History  The Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade was founded in 1901, when the Ethnographic Department was separated from the National Museum of Serbia. The inauguration of the first permanent exhibition of the museum was organized on 20 September 1904, during the centennial of the First Serbian Uprising. During the first years of its work, the activities of the Ethnographic Museum were focused on the purchase of museum items and the presentation of the Kingdom of Serbia abroad. In World War I, a large number of museum items were destroyed, as well as the documentation and the library. The museum library was re-established in 1920. Today, its holdings contain about 60,000 publications: 33,000 books and about 27,000 journals dealing with ethnology, anthropology and related scholarly disciplines. During World War II, museum objects were packed and removed from the building in which the museum was housed at that time. After the war, the museum was moved into the building of the Belgrade Stock Exchange at No. 13 Studentski Trg (Square). The museum collections currently contain about 200,000 items, 56,000 of which are ethnographic objects.

It had its original purpose of the stock market until the beginning of the Second World War and after the end of the war, one part of the building changed its purpose. At the beginning of the 1950s, a part of the basement, the ground floor, the mezzanine, the first and the second floor were ceded to the Ethnographic Museum. In the period from 1951 to 1954, renovation work of this part of the building was carried out for the purpose of placing museum collections and funds and organizing exhibition activities, and with the forthcoming adaptation conducted during 1983-1984, the building was tailored to the museum almost completely, on all five floors. Adaptations of the building are primarily related to customizing the interior to the new function, while the authenticity of its facade and monumental entrance area was preserved. As a work of urban-architectural, cultural and historical values within which there is a cultural institution which cherishes a rich ethnographic heritage, the Ethnographic Museum was established in 1984 as a cultural monument. The Museum today Until today, eight permanent exhibitions and about 300 temporary exhibitions were opened in the Ethnographic Museum. The permanent exhibition occupies three levels of the building. Today, the Ethnographic Museum houses a large number of ethnographic objects, distributed in private collections (furniture, jewelry, traditions, costumes, folk architecture, industry, animal husbandry, transport, cult objects, etc.), has one of the richest specialized libraries in the Balkans and publishes professional publications, has a great conservation service that handles virtually all types of materials, has a large exhibition space, organizes extensive ethnographic research and has a lot of will and knowledge to carry out an ethnological and anthropological study of the 19th century.

Located just south of the Canada‚ÄìUS border, it is part of the Chilliwack Group, a subrange of the Skagit Range which is part of the North Cascades. It is composed mainly of gneiss and is part of two major drainage basins: that of the Skagit River and Fraser River. With a topographic prominence of over , Mount Spickard is one of the most prominent peaks in the state, and has two minor summits. The mountain was named for a climber who fell to his death while ascending another nearby mountain peak. However, the first to ascend Mount Spickard was Walter B. Reaburn, in 1904. Description Mount Spickard rises to in the northernmost extreme of North Cascades National Park, making it the 5th highest peak in the park and the 16th highest in the state. Its prominence of is the ninth- greatest in the state and makes it the 70th-most prominent peak in the United States. It is located northwest of Jack Mountain, the nearest higher peak. The main summit of Spickard has two sub-peaks. The taller of the two is a summit, with a prominence of , to the northeast of the true summit. The shorter is located southwest of the main peak and rises to , but has of prominence. In his popular climbing guide, Fred Beckey uses the name \\"Peak 8824\\" for the northeast sub-peak. High ridges connect Mount Spickard to other peaks. A ridge to the southwest connects Spickard with Twin Spires (also called Mox Peaks) and the Ridge of Gendarmes. The high ridges to the southeast of Mount Spickard are somewhat broken up by glacier-couloirs but connect Spickard with summits known as Tombstone Peak and Peak 7153. Another high ridge extends to the northeast. The ridge to the northwest is broken by a saddle point but otherwise extends several miles, curving north and east, around Silver Lake to Mount Custer Ridge, Mount Rahm, and Devils Tongue.USGS topographic maps Hydrology There are many glaciers on Mount Spickard's slopes and neighboring ridges. Silver Glacier extends over a mile from Spickard's summit north through a large cirque to Silver Lake. The high terrain southwest of Mount Spickard is intensely glaciated, with numerous glaciers, some very large, extending over to Mount Redoubt. There are four main drainage basins reaching to the slopes of Mount Spickard. Depot Creek flows west and northwest to join the Chilliwack River and, ultimately, the Fraser River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean in British Columbia. On the south side of Spickard are some headstreams of Perry Creek, which flows east to Little Beaver Creek and, via Ross Lake, the Skagit River. To the north Silver Lake Glacier sends meltwater into Silver Lake. Meltwater streams from glaciers on the east side of Mount Spickard join the outflow, Silver Creek, which flows east from Silver Lake to Ross Lake. Access to the mountain is difficult due to the remote and rugged nature of the area. The easiest approach is from British Columbia via Chilliwack Lake and Depot Creek. There are two common approaches within Washington, both via water taxi on Ross Lake. History The geologist Reginald A. Daly studied the Spickard area in 1902 and 1906. He described Mount Spickard (then called Glacier Peak) and its neighbors as the most inaccessible summits of the entire U.S.‚ÄìCanada border region west of the Flathead River of the Rocky Mountains. The first ascent was made in 1904 by Walter B. Reaburn. A second ascent was made the following year by Thomas Riggs Jr., George Neuner Jr., and J. Beall. In 1906, Noel J. Ogilvie and a Canadian party climbed Mount Spickard. Mount Spickard was called Glacier Peak until 1963, when it was renamed in memory of Warren Spickard. Spickard was a distinguished mountaineer, who died in 1961 while climbing the nearby Northwest Twin Spires (also called Northwest Mox Peak or just Northwest Mox). He had climbed Mount Spickard in 1955.

Even before Kickstarter became mainstream, in 2005 Zipf funded his first tour solely off the $2 donations of his fans.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2005/03/26/AR2005032601978.html In 2006, he and manager Shawn Matthews raised more than $45,000 from his fans to produce The Long Tail EP. In 2009, he released ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Cowards Choir using a \\"pay as you can\\" model from his website. These music and marketing techniques caught the attention of Paste Magazine, Performing Songwriter Magazine, American Songwriter, XM Satellite Radio, and CMJ music festival. Zipf has had songs played on VH1 and MTV, and \\"Stumble on the Line\\" was featured on ABC's Private Practice.

Commenting on the song, Andersson stated that he came up with the idea at the hotel's fifth anniversary in September 2008 and was aware that a number of the staff were amateur singers and was satisfied that they could record a song together. He then asked Ulvaeus to come up with some lyrics.BBC entertainment - \\"Abba pair unveil new pop tracks\\" The song was released as a single on 6 May 2009. It came just as Andersson released an international album, Story of a Heart, with the title track as the lead single. \\"2nd Best to None\\" reached No.54 in the Swedish charts.Swedish singles chart  References   External links  * Official Rival Hotel site Category:2009 songs Category:Songs written by Benny Andersson and Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus ","title":"2nd Best to None"},{"id":"23175067","text":"Bartolo as a given name may refer to: *Bartholomew the Apostle (St. Bartholomew), known as San Bartolo in Spanish-speaking countries *Bartolo Col√≥n (born 1973), Dominican baseball pitcher *Bartolo di Fredi (1330-1410), Sienese School *Bl.

This includes electronic torque wrenches, click torque wrenches, dial torque wrenches, electric screwdrivers, air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, and torque screwdrivers. Today‚Äôs advanced torque testers include the ability to measure in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, convert to 8 engineering units (in¬∑oz, in¬∑lb, ft¬∑lb, N¬∑m, cN¬∑m, kgf¬∑cm, gf¬∑cm, kgf¬∑fm), 3 modes of operation (peak, 1st peak, track), and include a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certificate (or its domestic pendant). Torque testers measure properties such as torsional strength and stiffness and are used in quality control of various fields including medical devices, metals, and aerospace. Components =Transducer= A torque transducer, similar to a load cell, is an electronic device used to convert torque into an electrical signal. This conversion is indirect and happens in two stages. Through a mechanical arrangement, the torque being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge converts the deformation (strain) to electrical signals. A torque transducer usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Torque transducers of one or two strain gauges are also available. The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few millivolts and usually requires amplification by an instrumentation amplifier before it can be used. The output of the transducer is plugged into an algorithm to calculate the force applied to the transducer. There are several styles available for torque transducers. Rotary, stationary (reaction), and inline are used for different calibration and audit purposes. = Digital Display = A key component of modern torque testers is the digital display. A digital display is used to measure the output signal from the transducer and calculates that reading into a torque value that is displayed on screen. In most cases the display and transducer are contained together inside a housing. This is known as a ‚ÄúDesktop Torque Tester‚Äù. External rotary and stationary transducers can be used with portable displays (handheld torque analyzers). = Rundown Fixture (Joint Simulator)= A rundown fixture, also known as a joint simulator, is used during the calibration process to help test power tools (electric screwdrivers, air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, etc.). A joint simulator is placed on top of the transducers. An adapter bit is inserted into the power tool and is mated to top of the joint simulator. By using springs of different stiffness or stacking Belleville washers in set patterns, the joint simulator can replicate soft, medium, or hard joints. This is important when trying to repeat how a tool may be used on an actual process. External links *Brief History of Torque Measurement *Fastening: How Tight Is Tight?

He trained with the great masters in France for 12 years before moving to Los Angeles. He was quickly awarded the prestigious Mobil Travel Guide Five Star Award at two different restaurants, L'Orangerie in 1999 and 2000 and Bastide in 2006. He then went on to create his uber-popular LudoBites concept, a multi-city restaurant tour, followed by opening two restaurants in Los Angeles, Trois Mec and Petit Trois.Celebrity Living (May 2005) LA Weekly named Trois Mec Best New Restaurant Los Angeles in 2013, Los Angeles' Best Restaurant in 2014 and 2016, and named Ludo Best Chef 2015. Early life and training Lefebvre was born in Auxerre, Burgundy and grew up in a small village called Charbuy. In his early teens he expressed his desire to be a chef. His father took him to a local restaurant named Maxime and asked them to give Lefebvre some menial job in order to discourage him, but he loved it. His love for food began in his childhood, spending many of his days in his grandmother's kitchen. His formal culinary training began at age 14 at the restaurant L‚ÄôEsperance in V√©zelay under chef Marc Meneau, where he worked for three years. He then went on to work with Pierre Gagnaire at his eponymous restaurant in Saint-√âtienne (now closed), then with Alain Passard at L'Arp√®ge, where he trained in what he describes as \\"the school of fire,\\" learning to control and play with heat. Ludo concluded his formal French training with Guy Martin at Le Grand Vefour, from whom he states that he learned the business side of the food service industry.Top Chef Masters, Bravo Television Career =Restaurants= In 1996, Lefebvre moved to Los Angeles where he began work at L'Orangerie at the invitation of Gilles Epie, who was the head chef at the time. About a year later, at the age of 25, he was promoted to executive chef and went on to see the restaurant become one of the top-rated in California, receiving the Mobil Guide five-star award. In 2004, he moved to the restaurant Bastide on Melrose Place, which was also awarded the prestigious Mobil Guide five-star award under his direction. The dishes he created there included panini au foie gras with an apricot based accompaniment, poularde marinated in Pepsi-Cola with popcorn, and panna cotta topped with caviar in a salted-butter caramel sauce. After the restaurant closed for renovations, he decided not to return. On a whim, Ludo asked his friend who owned Breadbar, Ali Chalabi, if he could take over the bakery at night for 3 months when it was otherwise closed. There he created a special event dining experience which ultimately became known as LudoBites and was deemed by LA Weeklys Pulitzer Prize-winning critic, Jonathan Gold, as \\"a transforming moment in the Los Angeles restaurant scene.\\" He created the opening menu for the restaurant Lavo at the Palazzo in Las Vegas, and returned to Los Angeles in 2009. In May of that year, Ludo revived his special event dining concept LudoBites at Breadbar for another 3 months. After an extraordinary second run, it was clear that LudoBites was here to stay, and the \\"pop-up restaurant\\" concept was born. He went on to do nine total LudoBites pop-ups in Los Angeles, and one in Hawaii, crashing OpenTable twice and booking 6 weeks of reservations in 47 seconds. Bon Appetit called Ludo \\"the king of pop-ups.\\" Food writer Richard Guzman wrote of his experience at this venue: \\"I was sad. The meal was over. In a way, eating at Ludobites is like hooking up with someone way out of your league while on vacation with none of your friends around to witness it and no chance of replicating the experience.\\"Los Angeles Downtown News (16 August 2010) Richard Guzman, \\"Beautiful Bites; Ludovic Lefebvre's Unforgettable Fashion District Stand\\" The restaurant achieved national acclaim when New York Times restaurant critic Sam Sifton summarized his experience in an article on August 3, 2010: \\"The first night eating all this was an amazement. The second was about ten times better ‚Äì each dish perfectly executed, with every flavor in place, every temperature correct, every plate a fully realized piece of art. It was only the fifth night the restaurant had been open.\\" In September 2010, Ludo brought fried chicken to the streets of Los Angeles by opening his food truck, known on the streets as \\"LudoTruck\\". In October 2013, Ludo took his fried chicken concept to the next level opening his first brick and mortar location, LudoBird, inside the STAPLES Center.[LA Times: Fried chicken and biscuits at the new Ludo Bird at Staples Center] In March 2016, the second location of LudoBird opened at City Walk, Universal Studios Hollywood. Ludo is now being credited with carrying the flag for Los Angeles modern fine dining, opening Trois Mec in April 2013 in partnership with friends Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo. Trois Mec has earned 4 stars from both Los Angeles Magazine and LA Weekly, was named Best New Restaurant by both publications, was named to Esquire Magazine's Best New Restaurant List for 2013, included in GOOP ‚Äì List of Best Tasting Menus in the World under $100 and made Zagat's list of Top 10 Hottest Restaurants in the World for 2013. Food & Wine Magazine awarded Trois Mec with the #1 Best Restaurant Dish of 2013 and GQ placed Trois Mec #2 on its list of Best New Restaurants in the country for 2014. LA Weekly has named it the #1 Best Restaurant in Los Angeles for both 2014 and 2015. Trois Mec has also been listed as #34 on the Top 100 U.S. Restaurant List for 2015 on the popular blog Opinionated About Dining. In July 2014, Ludo opened his second restaurant, Petit Trois, his \\"bar-a-la-carte\\" concept. Eater LA called it \\"the most hotly anticipated restaurant opening in 2014.\\" Petit Trois is located next door to its sister restaurant, Trois Mec. It was awarded four stars by LA Weekly food critic Besha Rodell, who said, \\"It is simultaneously one of the most modest and ambitious restaurants to open in recent memory. It's a love letter to another city, written in food, by one of our greatest culinary poets.\\" 'Jonathan Gold, who had by then moved from LA Weekly to the Los Angeles Times, wrote that \\"there may be no better plate of escargot in town than at the new Petit Trois.\\" Lesley Balla for Angeleno Magazine called it \\"Petit Perfection\\", saying \\"this is a neighborhood bistro for true artistes, after all, created by culinary rockstars. And, unsurprisingly, it is a smash hit.\\" Petit Trois was a 2015 James Beard finalist for Best New Restaurant. =Television appearances= In 2006, Ludo appeared on Iron Chef America, challenging Mario Batali in a battle of Big Eye Tuna, where Batali prevailed. Beginning in 2009, Lefebvre appeared on the first and second seasons of Top Chef Masters. He was a guest judge on season 8 of Hell's Kitchen in 2010.
