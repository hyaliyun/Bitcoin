Born in Dublin, he is the son of successful National Hunt trainer, Dessie Hughes. Hughes became British flat racing Champion Jockey in 2012 and retained that title in 2013, when he rode more than 200 winners in the season, and again in 2014. Riding career Hughes started pony racing aged seven, having his first win aboard Chestnut Lady in a six furlong race at Wexford. His first ride in the senior ranks was in a six furlong maiden at Naas on 19 March 1988, on a debutant called Scath Na Greine. He finished tenth. Since the end of 2013, Hughes' main provider of rides has been trainer Richard Hannon Jr., who is also his brother in law. For many years before that he rode for Hannon's father, Richard Hannon Sr. and from 2001-07 he was also retained by the owner Prince Khalid Abdullah. Hughes is 5'10\\" in height, very tall for a flat jockey, similar to Tony McCoy; both men have to maintain his weight significantly below natural levels, even for a jockey. His larger natural size means he cannot ride horses carrying light weights, reducing his winning opportunities. Hughes is respected for his riding style of 'nursing' horses along, getting horses to respond and run into the race without appearing to physically ride them hard. In October 2011, Hughes received a five day ban for hitting Swift Blade six times in the final furlong and a few days later got a ten day ban for hitting More Than Words too many times with the whip inside the final furlong in a race at Kempton. The ban was the first of its kind to be implemented after a change in the rules regarding horse welfare. On 13 October 2011, it was announced that Hughes was giving up his racing licence and quitting the sport out of protest at the ban.Jockey Richard Hughes gives up riding licence in whip rule protest BBC Sport, 13 October 2011. Hughes did not follow up on this threat and on 15 October 2012 he equaled Frankie Dettori's record of winning seven races in a single meeting by winning seven out of eight races at Windsor Racecourse. The following month, he claimed his first British flat racing Champion Jockey title with 172 winners over the season. In May 2013, after a long wait, he won his first British Classic on Sky Lantern in the 1,000 Guineas. He then won his second a month later on Talent in the Oaks. On 21 June 2013, he won the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 1000 guineas winner Sky Lantern. At the end of the 2013 British flat racing Hughes was crowned Champion Jockey for the second consecutive season. His total of 208 winners made him the first jockey to ride more than 200 winners in a British flat season since Kieren Fallon in 2003. He retained the title again in 2014, before retiring and taking up training. Personal life Hughes is married to wife Lizzie and the couple have two son's and a daughter. Outside of racing he enjoys playing a lot of golf.

The application of positive pressure may be intended to prevent upper airway collapse, as occurs in obstructive sleep apnea, or to reduce the work of breathing in conditions such as acute decompensated heart failure. CPAP therapy is highly effective for managing obstructive sleep apnea. Compliance and acceptance of use of CPAP therapy can be a limiting factor, with 8% of people stopping use after the first night and 50% within the first year.  Medical uses  = Severe to moderate obstructive sleep apnea = CPAP is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, in which the mild pressure from the CPAP prevents the airway from collapsing or becoming blocked. CPAP has been shown to be 100% effective at eliminating obstructive sleep apneas in the majority of people who use the therapy according to their doctors recommendations. = Pre-term infants = CPAP also may be used to treat pre-term infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed. For example, physicians may use CPAP in infants with respiratory distress syndrome. It is associated with a decrease in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In some preterm infants whose lungs have not fully developed, CPAP improves survival and decreases the need for steroid treatment for their lungs. In resource-limited settings where CPAP improves respiratory rate and survival in children with primary pulmonary disease, researchers have found that nurses can initiate and manage care with once or twice daily physician rounds. = COVID-19 = In March 2020 the USFDA suggested that CPAP devices may be used to support patients affected by Covid-19; however, they recommended additional filtration as non-invasive ventilation may increase the risk of infectious transmission. = Other uses = CPAP has also been suggested for treating acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure in children, however the effectiveness and safety of this approach to providing respiratory support is not clear due to a limited number of clinical studies. Contraindications CPAP cannot be used in the following situations/conditions: * A person is not breathing on their own * A person is uncooperative or anxious * A person cannot protect their own airway (i.e., is unconscious) * A person is not stable due to respiratory arrest * A person has experienced facial trauma or facial burns * Previous facial, esophageal, or gastric surgeries may also make it difficult or not a suitable treatment option  Adverse effects Some people experience difficulty adjusting to CPAP therapy and report general discomfort, nasal congestion, bloating of the abdomen, sensations of claustrophobia, mask leak problems, and convenience- related complaints.  Mechanism  CPAP therapy uses machines specifically designed to deliver a flow of air at a constant pressure. This constant stream of air opens and keeps the upper airway unobstructed during inhalation and exhalation. Some CPAP machines have other features as well, such as heated humidifiers. It is an alternative to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Both modalities stent the lungs' alveoli open and thus recruit more of the lung's surface area for ventilation, but, while PEEP refers to devices that impose positive pressure only at the end of the exhalation, CPAP devices apply continuous positive airway pressure throughout the breathing cycle. Thus, the ventilator itself does not cycle during CPAP, no additional pressure above the level of CPAP is provided, and patients must initiate all of their breaths.An example of a nasal mask for CPAP CPAP setup for adults in a low resource setting = Method of delivery of CPAP =  Nasal CPAP  Nasal prongs or nasal mask is the most common modality of treatment. Nasal CPAP is frequently used in infants, though its use is controversial. Studies have shown nasal CPAP reduces ventilator time but an increased occurrence of pneumothorax was also prevalent. Nasal prongs are placed directly in the person's nostrils. A nasal mask is a small mask that covers the nose.  Nasopharyngeal CPAP  CPAP is administered by a tube that is placed through the person's nose and ends in the nasopharynx. This tube bypasses the nasal cavity in order to deliver the CPAP further down.  Face mask  A full face mask over the mouth and nose is another approach for people who breath out of their mouths when they sleep. Oral masks and naso-oral masks are often used when nasal congestion or obstruction is an issue. Devices that combine nasal pressure with mandibular advancement devices (MAD) also exist. Example of a full face masks CPAP = Compliance = A large portion of people do not adhere to the recommended usage of CPAP therapy, with over 50% of people discontinuing use in the first year. A significant change in behaviour is required in order to commit to long-term use of CPAP therapy, and this can be difficult for many people. In addition, people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea have a higher risk of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which can make it more difficult to change their sleep habits and use CPAP on a regular basis. Educational and supportive approaches have been shown to help motivate people that need CPAP therapy use their devices more often. Settings and measurements * CPAP This is the pressure applied without pause or end to the airway. Generally using flow to generate the pressure. * PEEP Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is the pressure in the lungs (alveolar pressure) above atmospheric pressure (the pressure outside of the body) that exists at the end of expiration. * Ramp This feature is present on many devices and allows the user to reduce the pressure to lowest setting and gradually increase to the set pressure. This allows the user to fall asleep with the pressure at a more comfortable setting. * FiO2 Fractional O2 percentage ‚Äì that is, the fraction of inspired oxygen that is added to the delivered air.  History  Colin Sullivan, an Australian physician and professor, is credited with having invented CPAP.https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/past-present-and-future-cpap See also  *  References   External links  * Category:Mechanical ventilation Category:Treatment of sleep disorders ","title":"Continuous positive airway pressure"},{"id":"7727602","text":"The First Meijin Tournament was a landmark go competition held in Japan in 1961 and 1962. Taking more than 18 months to complete, it was a round-robin (league) format event, featuring 13 top players. It arguably assembled the strongest field ever of players to compete in an all-play-all event. The structure, which produced in Fujisawa Hideyuki the first modern-era Meijin and initiated the titleholder system annual competition for that title, was never repeated. Subsequent Meijin Leagues have been round-robins for nine players, followed by a best-of-seven challenger match. ( Crosstable at Gobase.) The result was in doubt until the last game was finished, on 5 August 1962; the first games had been on 18 January 1961. The sponsors had held back the key games in the scheduling, to maintain the tension. The result was in the end something few could have predicted. Under the competition rules, komidashi was 5 points; if that made the game a jigo, it would be awarded to White. This has the same effect as komi of 5.5, except that as a tiebreak, White‚Äôs jigo wins were to count less than full wins. The final day featured the games between Fujisawa Hideyuki and Hashimoto Shoji, and Go Seigen and Sakata Eio. Fujisawa lost, and disappeared from the Nihon Ki-in building in Fukudaya, where the other game was in progress. When the only result that could have made Fujisawa the winner, a jigo win with White for Go Seigen, actually happened, Fujisawa had to be sought out to inform him that he was after all the first Meijin since Honinbo Shusai had died in 1940. According to Go Review, Fujisawa had to be brought back from a bar where he was drowning his sorrows. Final standings With each player having played 12 games, the results were: * 9 wins, Fujisawa Hideyuki 9, winner on tie break, Go Seigen * 8 wins, Sakata Eio * 7 wins Hashimoto Shoji, Kitani Minoru, Handa Dogen * 6 wins Fujisawa Hosai * 5 wins Miyashita Shuyo, Sugiuchi Masao, Shimamura Toshihiro * 4 wins Iwata Tatsuaki * 3 wins Hashimoto Utaro, Takagawa Kaku The 78 games were each played over two days, with ten hours each on the clock.

Attempts to use the sails only pushed the boat further into the reef. After these attempts he decided to go over the ‚Äúobstruction‚Äù. This just made things worse. The captain gathered the 87 passengers from below and was in the midst of explaining their situation when a rush of water into the cabin forced all to the top deck, where a giant wave struck the boat and swept all women and children, and many of the men, into the frozen waters. Two lifeboats were launched from the City of Columbus only to have the ocean waves smash them against the iron sides of the ship. Passengers and crew attempted to stay afloat in the rough seas by holding onto the rigging of the ship. Lighthouse keeper Horiatio N. Pease and a complement of Gay Head Wampanoag Indians braved the waves in two lifeboats to save passengers that had held on. The sea was so rough that the Indians feared approaching the steamer would cause their own boat to get smashed, so they called to the men to dive off the rigging and come to the lifeboats. Most of those who attempted this were saved by the Indians. The rescue effort was then continued when the revenue cutter Dexter, skippered by Captain Eric Gabrielson, came to their aid. The Dexter, being a smaller ship, was able to move about the wreckage and pull survivors off the rigging and masts. Two of the survivors were unconscious; Second Lieutenant John U. Rhodes saved them by tying himself to a rope and swimming to the wreck. Even after being hit with a piece of wreckage, he continued, climbing the rigging to bring the men back to safety. The City of Columbus had left Boston with 45 officers and crew and 87 passengers, only 17 crew members and 12 passengers survived the ordeal. This incident was reported as one of the worst ocean disasters of its time.\\"History of Gay Head Light, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts\\", New England Lighthouses: A Virtual Guide, newenglandlighthouses.net website The shipwreck was later purchased by the Boston Towboat Company in 1886, and some parts were salvaged.City of Columbus (+1884) Wrecksite Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations ;References cited  * Category:Steamships of the United States Category:Aquinnah, Massachusetts Category:Passenger ships of the United States Category:1878 ships Category:Ships built by the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works Category:Shipwrecks of the Massachusetts coast Category:Martha's Vineyard Category:Maritime incidents in 1884 ","title":"SS City of Columbus"},{"id":"7727670","text":"USS Fiske (DD/DDR-842) was a of the United States Navy, the second Navy ship named for Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske (1854‚Äì1942), inventor of the Stadimeter and the aerial torpedo. Fiske was launched on 8 September 1945 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. F. E. Ribbentrop; and commissioned on 28 November 1945, Commander C. H. Smith in command. Service history =1945-1952= Joining the Atlantic Fleet, Fiske served as an engineering school ship for Destroyer Force, Atlantic, out of Portland, Maine, and made three cruises to the Mediterranean for duty with the 6th Fleet from her home port at Newport, Rhode Island, prior to the outbreak of the Korean War. In addition, she took part in the regular schedule of training operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean where in 1948 she rescued 10 men from a small coastal freighter sinking in the Windward Passage. On 3 January 1951, Fiske sailed from Newport for the Panama Canal and the Far East, reporting on 12 February to the 7th Fleet at Sasebo, Japan for duty in the Korean War. Along with screening carrier task forces, she patrolled off Korea, joined in bombarding shore targets, and escorted shipping from Japan to the action areas. Sailing westward for home, she arrived at Newport from her round-the-world cruise on 8 August 1951. Fiske was decommissioned on 1 April 1952 for conversion to a radar picket destroyer, and accordingly reclassified DDR-842 on 18 July 1952. =1952-1963= Recommissioned 25 November 1952, Fiske trained with her new equipment in preparation for her participation in the fall of 1953 in NATO Operation \\"Mariner,\\" which took her north of the Arctic Circle. In 1954 she resumed her annual tours of duty in the Mediterranean, serving the carrier task forces of the 6th Fleet as radar picket. Fiske in heavy seas, ca. 1960. Her training operations when assigned to the 2nd Fleet for duty in the western Atlantic and Caribbean included special work in development of anti-submarine warfare, and air defense. Homeported at Mayport, Florida, from August 1960, Fiske joined in NATO exercises north of the Arctic Circle in the fall of 1960, and at the close of the year, sailed for patrol duty in the Caribbean. In October 1962 Fiske returned to Mayport from the Canary Islands where she had positioned herself for astronaut splashdown. On the evening of her arrival back home, and without her full crew, she was ordered to rendezvous with the in the Windward Passage as the Soviets were challenging the United States in the Cuban Missile Crisis. DDR-842 then joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea in February 1963. Following this deployment another change of home port to Newport, Rhode Island, took place. =1964-1965= Fiskes classification reverted to DD-842 on 1 April 1964. Under the command of Cdr. John R. Ewing, Fiske underwent a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM Mark I) at Brooklyn Navy Yard during 1964. Among other things, Fiskes second forward gun mount, Mount 52, was removed, and replaced by a pair of triple-mount Mark 32 torpedo tubes. The superstructure was replaced and an Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) launcher and launch station was installed between the funnels on the 01 level. Aft of Stack 2 the superstructure was modified to include a Magazine (on the port side 01 level) for torpedoes, ASROC rockets and warheads, and depth charges for the DASH (Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter) system, and a hangar starboard side 01 level for the two DASH helos. Aft of this superstructure the remainder of the 01 level was flight deck. Trials began in December 1964 with a period of shakedown cruises between yard visits with several dry-dock periods. In the late winter of 1965 Fiske underwent Operational Readiness Inspection at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba. After successful completion, she returned to her home port, and the rest of DesRon 12, at Newport Naval Station, Rhode Island. On Mother's Day, 1965, all leaves and liberties were canceled and an emergency recall was sent out for immediate return to the ship. Fiske got underway about 0300 Monday morning, and headed south for the Dominican Republic, where a civil war had broken out. Fiske spent approximately one month patrolling the entrance to Santo Domingo Harbor, earning the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her efforts. Back in Newport, routine sea periods and a short period detached to Norfolk Naval Station for duty as escort to the newly commissioned , undergoing sea trials during the late summer of 1965. A relaxed leave and liberty policy was the rule for the next six months as crew changes were made prior to the \\"Acey Deucy Squadron\\" (DesRon 12) deploying to Vietnam. =Vietnam, 1966= On 19 January 1966, Fiske cast off all lines, and shifted colors as she got under way for Vietnam. In company with DesRon 12 - comprising DesDiv 121: (flagship), , Fiske, and (DD-880); and DesDiv 122: , , , and (DD-888) - Fiske sailed south into the Caribbean, and through the Gulf of Mexico, transiting the Panama Canal on 25 January. DesRon 12 then visited San Diego Naval Station for approximately eight hours on 5 February to pick up equipment, then got underway for Hawaii. On 10 February 1966, Fiske and Dyess participated in the rescue of the pilot of a small plane that ran out of fuel on the way to Hawaii. The pilot ditched and was picked up by Dyess. On 11 February, the Squadron moored at Pearl Harbor Naval Station, Hawaii. After five days in Hawaii, DesRon 12 got underway for the Philippine Islands, crossing the International Date Line on 18 February, as the crews entered the Realm of the Golden Dragon. Fiske and the rest of \\"Acey Deucy Squadron\\" rounded the northern islands of the Philippine Archipelago on 27 February, and made port at Subic Bay Naval Station, Republic of the Philippines, on 28 February. On 11 March, Fiske was underway for her first War Patrol. Fiske entered the Combat Zone on 12 March, and the crew qualified on 13 March for an Income Tax Exemption, and the Vietnam Service Medal. On 18 March, the crew qualified for Hostile Fire Pay. The remainder of March, 1966 was spent as escort and plane guard for the , and the (CVA(N)-65) on \\"Yankee Station\\" off the \\"I Corps Operational Area\\". Detached from escort duties on 1 April, Fiske entered the Gulf of Tonkin for duty as a Search and Rescue (SAR) ship, answering the first SAR call on 2 April, an operation involving a pilot and a rescue helicopter from Enterprise, though unable to assist, the helicopter with pilot aboard cleared North Vietnamese airspace en route to the Enterprise. On the morning of 4 April, while engaged in a SAR patrol, Fiske came under fire from a North Vietnamese heavy shore battery. Unable to locate the battery which was apparently masked behind some coastal hills, Fiske turned away and resumed her patrol. Fiske returned to Subic Bay where, on 21 April, a change of Command ceremony was held, with Cdr. William McKinley, USN, relieving Captain Ewing. After some port time in Subic Bay, Fiske was underway once again for another War Patrol. She joined the on 26 April, and operated with her for the next ten days, with two short trips into the Gulf of Tonkin for SAR duty. Leaving Hancock, Fiske then re-joined Ranger, and escorted her to Yokusuka Naval Station, Japan, arriving on 12 May, and not departing until 25 May for her third War Patrol due to casualties to the Ranger, and to the . She entered the Combat Zone on 28 May. On 30 May, Fiske took up duty outside the Combat Zone as an Anti-Air Warfare Picket ship. On 6 June, Fiske relieved of Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS) duties and escorted a truck convoy along the Coast Highway approximately 50 miles south to Da Nang, on her fourth War Patrol. By 10 June, Fiske was moored for four days of liberty in Hong Kong, British Crown Colony. Departing for her fifth War Patrol on 14 June, Fiske arrived off Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province for NGFS duty the next day. She fired 119 rounds of 5 inch, 38 caliber ammunition at four target areas, destroying 18 structures, damaging trenches and ten other structures. The next day found Fiske on NGFS station off Da Nang, firing 57 rounds at four target areas, including Viet Cong caves, assembly areas, and one VC Observation Post. During a second mission that day an ammunition dump on a hill top was struck by Fiske's shells, which exploded the top of the hill. 17 June found the Fiske supporting the 2nd Battalion, 4th Division, U.S. Marines in \\"Operation Dodge\\" in the area of the ancient Vietnamese capital of Hu·∫ø. During the next four days of \\"Operation Dodge\\", Fiske fired night illumination missions. Subsequently, Fiske was detached and ordered south to the \\"III Corps Operational Area\\" for a mission requiring Fiske to transit up the Mekong River nearly to Saigon. The mission was cancelled at the last minute, but not before some hands witnessed nighttime \\"Arc Light\\" B-52 raids, and \\"Puff\\" firing its Gatling guns from the air to the ground in the area of the Mekong River delta. After an eight-day port call to Kaohsiung, Formosa, Fiske returned to Subic Bay on 5 July. Departing Subic Bay on the 6th, Fiske entered the Combat Zone for the sixth and final War Patrol, a short stint as a part of \\"Operation Market Time\\". Departing the Combat Zone later the same day, Fiske and the rest of the ships of DesRon 12 began the journey home. =1966-1967= On 8 July, the \\"Pollywogs\\" took over the ship, but revenge was taken the very next day. As Fiske crossed the Equator at Longitude 106 degrees, 27 minutes East, in the Singapore Strait, the segment of the crew that heretofore had never crossed the equator received justice from those who had: the \\"Shellbacks\\", and were mercifully, and most ceremonially converted from \\"Pollywogs\\" to \\"Shellbacks\\" after suffering the pains and torments required when entering the realm of King Neptune himself. DesRon 12 headed west, with stops at Penang, Malaysia, then Cochin, India, and Aden Protectorate, British Crown Colony, through the Red Sea (complete with a desert sandstorm), and the Suez Canal. Entering the Mediterranean Sea, she anchored in the port of Piraeus, Greece, the port of Athens. Two more stops in early August, at Barcelona, Spain on the 4th for three days, and Gibraltar, British Crown Colony on the 9th for one day, Fiske entered the Atlantic Ocean, last seen in late January, and returned to the welcoming bands and families on the pier at Newport on 17 August. During the cruise, the Fiske circumnavigated the world, steaming over 54 thousand miles (43 thousand by navigation). She spent 210 days away from homeport, 146 of which were at sea. Two days were spent transiting the two canals, Panama and Suez. Fiske replenished underway (UNREP) on 55 occasions, from Oilers, Refrigerator ships, and Cargo and Ammunition ships, and even completed an \\"unrep triple play\\" receiving oil, ammunition, and supplies all at one time from the new . Fiske then settled into her routine at Newport for a well-deserved rest, although an all-too- short one. In May 1967 Fiske departed Newport, Rhode Island, for an extended Mediterranean cruise. The first stop along the way was a routine service stop at Gibraltar. Next came Malta for Liberty Call. Due to an escalating situation between Egypt and Israel over control of the Suez Canal Fiske was ordered to traverse the Suez Canal. After a day in Port Said she formed up with the other ships including the for the trip through the Suez Canal. This occurred at the beginning of the Six-Day War between Egypt and Israel. The purpose of Fiskes presence was to protect US shipping interests in the area, assigned to monitor all ship traffic into and out of the Persian Gulf. In some cases boarding these ships as necessary. On occasion the ship was called upon to perform rescue missions when ships ran into trouble, as in one case when a freighter ran aground. Fiske remained in the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Strait of Hormuz areas until August. Liberty Ports of Call were unusual for US warships. They included Djibouti, French Somaliland; Massawa, Ethiopia; Bahrain; Karg Island, Madagascar; Diego-Suarez, and Mombasa, Kenya. Fiske treated Massawa as her \\"homeport\\" away from home. The plan for Fiske to return to Newport was to include a stop at Caracas, Venezuela. These plans were quickly changed when the carrier suffered numerous explosions and fires on 29 July 1967 while operating in Vietnam. New orders were to for Fiske to rendezvous with Forrestal off the coast of South Africa and provide an escort for her to Mayport, Florida. Fiske finally returned to Newport, Rhode Island, in September 1967. =1967-1980= In October 1967, CDR James S. Brunson (USN) assumed command. After a few months Fiske was sent to Boston Naval Shipyard for a complete overhaul. She remained in the yards until May or June 1968. Late summer she again deployed for another Mediterranean cruise returning early in 1969. Fiske completed a six-month Middle East cruise July 1973 to her home port Newport, Rhode Island. She was then reassigned to the Navy Reserve Force, and her homeport moved to the Military Ocean Terminal, Bayonne, New Jersey (MOTBY). Fiske made many Reserve training weekend cruises from 1973 to 1976, including a 3-month Mediterranean cruise in 1974. Some ports visited were Naples, Barcelona, Malaga, and Rota. She was moored in Bayonne (New York Harbor) during the Bicentennial \\"Tall Ships\\". Fiske was overhauled again in 1976 and remained in the Naval Reserve force, stationed at Bayonne, New Jersey, (MOTBY). Transferred to Turkey on 5 June 1980. Fiske was stricken from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 6 August 1987. TCG Piyalepasa (D350) The ship served in the Turkish Navy as TCG Piyalepasa (D350), named after Piyale Pasha. The ship was heavily damaged when she ran aground in late 1996; she was scrapped in 1999. In popular culture The USS Fiske is shown in X-Men: First Class, where a crewman is recording the action with an 8mm camera.

During the Stalinist period in the Soviet Union, it was one of the unmarked mass grave sites where the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, disposed of thousands of executed \\"enemies of the Soviet state\\". The number of dead bodies buried there is estimated between \\"dozens of thousand,\\" to 30,000,\\"Ukraine reburies 2,000 victims of Stalin's rule\\". Reuters. 27 October 2007 to 100,000 though some estimates place the number as high as 200,000. Burial site From the early 1920s until late 1940s throughout the Stalinist purges, the Soviet government hauled the bodies of tortured and killed political prisoners to the pine forests outside the village of Bykivnia and buried them in a grave that spanned . So far, 210 separate mass graves have been identified by Polish and Ukrainian archaeologists working at the site. During the Soviet retreat in the early stages of the Operation Barbarossa, the Red Army troops levelled the village to the ground. The mass grave site was discovered by the Germans along with many other such sites throughout the Soviet Union. However, following the discovery of the Katyn massacre, the burial sites of Bykivnya was no longer part of German propaganda. After the Soviet recapture of the area in the course of the Second Battle of Kiev in 1943, the site was yet again classified by the NKVD. In the 1950s the village was reconstructed as a suburb of Kyiv. In the 1970s the Soviet authorities planned to construct a large bus station on the mass grave site, but the plan was abandoned. A document attesting to the origins of the Bykovnia victims was found by the Polish √©migr√© historians in Nazi German archives after the war. Polish researchers estimate that, apart from the Soviet victims of the Great Terror, the site might be the final resting place of 3,435 Polish officers captured by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Poland together with Nazi Germany in 1939, most of whom were executed in the spring of 1940 with over 20,000 Polish officers and intellectuals in the Katyn massacre. However, as the Soviet authorities denied responsibility, there was no way to confirm that the victims of the Stalinist purges were indeed buried there. During the Soviet era the existence of the site was brought up to authorities numerous times with the most famous incident occurring in 1962 when the Ukrainian poet Vasyl Symonenko did so. He was badly beaten up by Soviet law enforcement agents and died in the hospital from kidney failure soon after. =Commemoration= It was not until the 1990s that the authorities of independent Ukraine confirmed the burial of thousands of victims there. On April 30, 1994, a large memorial to the victims of communism was opened in Bykivnia. Around the same time archaeological works started, with both Ukrainian and Polish scientists taking part. In 2001 the government of Viktor Yanukovych proclaimed the will to convert the Bykivnia woods into a State Historical-Memorial Complex \\"Graves of Bykivnia\\". The plan was brought to life by Viktor Yushchenko on May 17, 2006. In a step toward uncovering this part of Ukraine's history, Viktor Yushchenko became the first Ukrainian president to take part in the annual Day of Remembrance ceremony on May 21 to honor the estimated 100,000 people buried in the mass grave on the outskirts of Kyiv. \\"We must know the truth. Why did our nation lose more than 10 million people without a war?\\" Yushchenko said during the 2006 event. Bykivnia monument Since 2006, Polish researchers have found a number of bodies of Poles, prisoners killed in spring 1940 during the Katyn massacre. Apart from bodies, Polish researchers found everyday use things, such as a comb, on which the owner, an unknown Polish officer, carved several names, such as Franciszek Strzelecki, Ludwik Dworak and Szczyrad ... (this potentially might be referring to Colonel Bronis≈Çaw Miko≈Çaj Szczyrad≈Çowski, deputy of commandant of Lw√≥w's defense in September 1939). Also, a dog tag belonging to Sergeant J√≥zef Naglik, soldier of the Skalat Battalion of the Border Defence Corps, was found at the same spot. All the names belong to the \\"Ukrainian list\\" of Katyn massacre victims, and serve as proof that Bykivnya is connected to the Katyn crime.

In June 1788, Pym joined the Royal Navy as captain's servant of the frigate Eurydice. He was promoted to lieutenant of the sloop Martin, under Captain William Grenville Lobb, and served under Lobb aboard the and the Aimable. From November 1798, Pym served aboard the Ethalion (36), taking part in the capture of the Spanish Thetis and Santa-Brigida in 1799. The Ethalion was wrecked on the Penmarks on Christmas Day. From April 1804, Pym served aboard the Mars, and from June on the 74-gun Atlas, under the overall command of Sir John Thomas Duckworth. Pym was decorated after the Battle of San Domingo, on 6 February 1806. In October 1808, Pym took command of the 36-gun frigate Sirius, in the squadron of Commodore Rowley. In 1810, Pym was sent to the Isle de France (now Mauritius) to lead a squadron consisting of the frigates Sirius, Iphigenia, Nereide, and the brig Staunch. On 13 August, the squadron captured the √éle de la Passe which commanded the entrance of Grand Port, and moved to blockade Port Louis. On 21 August, the squadron seized the East Indiaman Wyndham, previously captured by the French, and learnt that a French frigate squadron had arrived at Grand Port. The British squadron attempted to attack the French squadron at anchor and moved into the harbour. Entering it, the Sirius and Magicienne ran aground and became unmanoeuverable. The Nereide struck her colours before the French frigates, and the Sirius and Magicienne were scuttled by fire. The last ship of the squadron, the Iphigenia, surrendered two days later. Pym, then at the √éle de la Passe, was taken prisoner along with the whole garrison. The Battle of Grand Port became the only defeat of a British squadron against Napoleonic France. Pym was released in December when Sir Albemarle Bertie recaptured the √éle de la Passe. He was court-martialled and found innocent of the defeat. In February 1812, Pym was in command of the 74-gun ship Hannibal, off Cherbourg, in May of the Niemen, and in 1830 of HMS Kent. Pym was made a rear-admiral in 1837. He served as admiral-superintendent at Devonport from 1841 to 1846, and in the autumn of 1845 commanded the experimental squadron in the Channel. He was promoted to vice-admiral in 1847 and to full admiral in 1851.

It was originally planned as part of a connecting line between the East Coast of the United States and Buffalo, New York. Reading sponsorship The railroad was incorporated on February 17, 1870 to run from the vicinity of Williamsport to Jersey Shore, up Pine Creek and down the Allegheny River to Port Allegany,https://books.google.com/books?id=SVBNAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA149 as part of a route to Buffalo. While it was organized under a new charter, this represented a continuation of the Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and State Line Railroad project; that corporation had made surveys up Pine Creek with the aim of connecting with another railroad on the northern border of the state, possibly extending as far west as McKean County to do so. Sobieski Ross assumed the presidency of the company and began pushing grading from Jersey Shore towards Coudersport. Locomotive and station of the Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway On December 1, 1871, President Ross wrote to George B. McClellan, extolling the advantages of the route. McClellan was then president of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, which shipped petroleum to New York City over the Erie Railway. The Erie's service was felt to be unsatisfactory, and the A&GW; potentially interested in a new partner. The eastern end of the A&GW; was at Salamanca, New York, about from Port Allegany along the Allegheny River, and could easily be extended along the river to connect with the JSPC&B.; At Newberry, near Williamsport, traffic could be routed onto the Catawissa Railroad and then the Central Railroad of New Jersey to reach the New York area. Ross's letter gives a good idea of the route planned. He says that it would descend on the western side via Mill Creek, which meets the Allegheny River at Coudersport. The closest approach to the Pine Creek watershed would leave Mill Creek to climb along Nelson Run. A summit tunnel long was planned, which would suffice to carry a line from the headwaters of Nelson Run into Splash Dam Hollow, then down Lyman Run to the West Branch Pine Creek, reaching the main stream of Pine Creek at Galeton. Besides the JSPC&B;'s value as a trunk line, Ross hopefully anticipated the development of traffic along the line from lumbering, coal mining, and iron manufacturing. In the end, only lumbering and tanning would play a significant role in the industry of the area. The coal beds along the Allegheny River west of Coudersport were proclaimed \\"worthless\\" by the State Geological Survey in 1885, nor could the local iron ore deposits be economically worked. Another proposed railroad, the Rochester, Hornellsville, and Pine Creek Railroad, was chartered in 1872 and would have built south from Hornellsville, New York to the state line as part of a route from Hornellsville to Williamsport, which would have used the tracks of the JSPC&SL; or JSPC&B; for the portion in Pennsylvania. As originally contemplated, the Pennsylvania portion of the route would have run directly down the Pine Creek valley, but by the beginning of 1873, the RH&PC; had decided that such a route would be uneconomical and had decided on a less direct route, reaching Pine Creek via the Wellsboro and Lawrenceville Railroad and an extension southwest from Antrim, Pennsylvania. While grading of the JSPC&B; began on June 12, 1873, the Panic of 1873 soon brought a halt to construction. The Gaines and State Line Railroad was chartered in 1875 with the intention of building north from the JSPC&B; at Gaines to the state line to provide the link to the RH&PC.; This line would have carried all the way to Geneva, New York, but was never completed. Sobieski Ross died in 1877, and was succeeded as president by John S. Ross. The New York Central and coal During the early 1880s, the New York Central Railroad (NYC) and a consortium of coal companies from Tioga County, Pennsylvania and New York State embarked upon a bold venture. The coal companies were plagued by labor disputes, and the deposits they mined were diminishing. The NYC feared that its rival, the Pennsylvania Railroad, would use its control over coal shipments from central Pennsylvania to inflate the price of that fuel. The solution decided upon was that the coal companies, backed by the NYC, would build a new rail line into the Clearfield Coalfield and open new mines there. Coal would move north over the new line to the NYC. The JSPC&B; would be a key link in the new extension. It would also link the NYC to its ally, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, via the latter's Catawissa Railroad subsidiary at Newberry. George Magee, of the Fall Brook Coal Company, took control of the JSPC&B; in 1881. He took advantage of a provision of the railroad's charter allowing for branches of up to thirty miles in any county traversed by the main line to build a new connection from the Fall Brook's Corning, Cowanesque and Antrim Railroad at Stokesdale Junction, near Wellsboro, and follow Marsh Creek to Pine Creek and the original JSPC&B; route at Ansonia, and then pass downstream to Jersey Shore and the Reading connection at Newberry. Magee and the NYC were not particularly interested in the remainder of the route to the west of Ansonia. He sold the roadbed from Coudersport to Port Allegany to a local group, which incorporated in 1882 as the Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad and opened a line on the old grade between the two towns in its name in 1882. The JSPC&B; continued construction on the route from Newberry to Stokesdale Junction, which ran through the spectacular Pine Creek Gorge (also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania) below Ansonia. The new line began regular service on June 4, 1883 and was opened over its whole length on July 1, 1883. The new line was not directly operated by the New York Central; rather, on December 18, 1882, it was leased to the Fall Brook Coal Company from the date of completion (officially June 30, 1883) for twenty years. The company's name was changed to the Pine Creek Railway on February 6, 1884. Most of the rest of the planned route between Ansonia and Coudersport saw track laid by the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad and dependent logging lines. However, it was not connected so as to form a through route, and the summit tunnel was never built. Pine Creek Railway As the Pine Creek Railway, the new line formed an important part of the Fall Brook's system. The Fall Brook already leased the Corning, Cowanesque & Antrim and a series of NYC-controlled lines in New York, giving it a continuous line from Tioga County to the NYC main line at Lyons, New York. On July 1, 1892, the Fall Brook Coal Company separated its railroad and coal interests, transferring the Pine Creek Ry. lease to the new Fall Brook Railway. However, the independent operation of these lines by the Fall Brook was not to last. In 1895, the NYC began to investigate buying out the Fall Brook, which now formed a vital link between the New York Central main line and the NYC-controlled Beech Creek Railroad at Jersey Shore. The NYC ultimately succeeded in buying up the Fall Brook Railway, and took over the Pine Creek Railway lease on May 1, 1899. On February 4, 1909, the Pine Creek was merged with other elements of the former Fall Brook system to form the Geneva, Corning and Southern Railroad, which in turn was merged into the New York Central on December 22, 1914. After the 1899 takeover, the former Fall Brook lines were operated by the NYC as the Fall Brook District, Pennsylvania Division. The Pine Creek line was one of those taken over by Conrail in 1976, but the last train ran on the route on October 7, 1988. After the removal of the tracks, the right-of-way was converted to the Pine Creek Rail Trail. Former JSPC&B; right-of-way along Pine Creek.

Early life and education  Challinor was born in Stoke-on-Trent. Both of his parents were political activists, his father was secretary of his branch of the Labour Party, and his mother was a member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Both of his parents had also left their Methodist roots and were agnostic. He became a voracious reader and collector of books and pamphlets in his youth. Challinor said that the daily diet in the Challinor household was \\"politics, for breakfast, dinner and supper.\\" His parents separated when he was 11 and he was sent to live with his aunt. Challinor attended Crewe Grammar School until his parents' separation, and was then sent off to board at the George Fox Quaker School in Lancaster. Pupils were actually encouraged to take part in local politics and in 1941 he became involved in the Lancaster by-election, supporting the Independent Labour Party candidate Fenner Brockway. Challinor's first political allegiance was to the ILP, and in 1946, at the age of 18, Challinor became attracted to the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), a group within the ILP. During his National Service, Challinor registered as a conscientious objector and so worked the lands instead of joining the military.  Early political activity  Challinor moved back to Stoke-on-Trent and worked on a local newspaper. During this period, the RCP fractured three ways, and Challinor joined the group under Tony Cliff named the Socialist Review Group. Later, this became the International Socialists (IS), and from the 1970s it was the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). He also struck up a friendship with Stan Newens, later a Labour MP, who had chosen the Staffordshire pits for his National Service. As a young activist, Challinor had formed the opinion that the Soviet Union was not a workers' state. At the age of 18, he wrote that \\"it is criminal to call Russia Socialist. This harms not only the cause of the Russian worker but also that of Revolutionary Socialism. The only thing to do is to tell the truth about Russia and to show it has nothing in common with Socialism.\\" After the formation of the Socialist Review Group, Challinor became a member of the editorial committee of a new newspaper, Socialist Review. In 1952, he started a four-year degree at the University College of North Staffordshire at Keele. He became involved with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the Committee of 100, attending the first Aldermaston March in 1958. He was briefly a local councillor for the Labour Party, and was selected then deselected as a parliamentary candidate for Nantwich, his anti- Labour writings too much for the party headquarters.  Personal life  In 1952, Challinor met Mabel Brough in the Labour League of Youth. They married in 1957, and had one son, Russell, born in 1962.

The object of the game is for a player to play all the dominoes from his or her hand onto one or more chains, or \\"trains\\", emanating from a central hub or \\"station\\". The game's most popular name comes from a special optional train that belongs to all players. However, the game can be played without the Mexican train; such variants are generally called \\"private trains\\" or \\"domino trains\\". It is related to the game chicken foot. Equipment A double-twelve set of dominoes is marketed as the standard for Mexican train, and accommodates up to eight players. Other sets are commonly used as well. The following alternate sets are common, depending on the number of people playing: * Double-six (2 players)* Double- fifteen (9‚Äì12 players) * Double-eighteen (13 players) In addition to dominoes, the game also requires: * One token or marker for each player * A special spacer, known as the \\"station\\" or \\"hub\\", used to evenly space the trains around the central domino (optional). * Pencil and paper to keep score Many sets of dominoes include a station and special train-shaped tokens for markers, and packaged games with a central \\"station\\" and custom tokens are available. However, the station piece is not strictly needed, and anything from coins to poker chips to even pieces of candy or slips of paper can be used as markers. Objective The object of all Trains games is to be the first player to place all of their dominoes. Dominoes may be placed onto the player's train, onto the Mexican train if available, or on the trains of other players under special circumstances. The middle tile counts as the start of a player's multiple tile train. Setup At the start of each round, the dominoes are placed face side down, shuffled, and drawn by players to form their hands. Using the double-nine set, players draw dominoes as follows: * 2‚Äì4 players: 10 dominoes each * 5‚Äì6 players: 9 dominoes each * 7‚Äì8 players: 7 dominoes each Any remaining dominoes are placed to one side, forming the \\"boneyard\\". Gameplay With a standard double-twelve set the double twelve is placed in the station. In each successive round the next lower double is used until all doubles are used. The double-blank is the final round. Play continues to the left.Kelly, Jennifer A., Great Book of Domino Games. Sterling 1999. . Each person lays one legally placed domino per turn, or two if the player's first domino is a double. If they are unable to, they must draw a domino from the boneyard. If they are able to lay that domino, they must do so immediately. Otherwise, their turn is over and play continues to the left, each player trying to place all their dominoes by playing matching dominoes one at a time, end to end. A train can be as long as the players can make it; it only ends when all dominoes that could match its endpoint have already been played. As a result, trains can become quite long, especially with an extended domino set. It is acceptable to \\"bend\\" the train 90¬∞ or 180¬∞ to keep the train on the playing surface, as long as it does not interfere with the endpoints of other trains. =Public trains= All trains begin the game as \\"public,\\" and all players may play on them. When a player plays a domino on their train it then becomes \\"private.\\" When a player draws a domino and is unable to play it, they must mark their train as \\"public\\" by placing a marker on their train. If a player is deemed to have made a strategic error the highest score of that round is added to theirs. Players have the option, whether they can play on their own train or not, of playing a domino on any train currently marked \\"public.\\" When a player with a \\"public\\" train adds a domino to it, it becomes \\"private\\" again and may not be played on except by the train's owner. =The Mexican train= The Mexican train is an additional train that anyone may play on during their turn. They can start the train by playing a domino matching the engine (i.e. the double played at the beginning of the round) or add to the train. Mexican trains can be added as long as a space remains. Mexican train dominoes can not end on a double. =Playing doubles= When a double is played, it is placed perpendicular to the train. Subsequently, adding a domino to the double is called \\"finishing\\", \\"satisfying the double\\" or \\"covering the double.\\" The player that plays the double has to cover the double or their train becomes public and someone else has to cover the double before normal play can resume. If a double remains unfinished after it has been played, the train becomes a \\"public\\" train. No other train can be added to by any player until someone \\"finishes the double\\". Play passes to the next player who can legally play on this train (if the train is theirs, or if they can legally play on \\"public\\" trains). If they cannot \\"finish the double\\", they must draw a domino, and if they cannot play it on the double, their own train becomes \\"public\\". Play continues like this until someone \\"finishes the double\\". Single and double blanks are considered wilds. Branching on doubles as in Chicken Foot is allowed as an option (see Variations below). =Scoring= At the end of each round, the player going out receives 0 points, while all other players receive the sum of all pips (dots) on their dominoes. The person with the fewest points after all thirteen rounds have been played is the winner. In the case of a tie, the person with the most 0-point rounds is the winner. (If this is still a tie, the person with the lowest round total other than 0 is the winner). =Partnerships= With four, six or eight players, the game can be played in teams of two, with partners sitting opposite each other. Rules are identical except that a player's train and their partner's train are considered one and the same (they will usually extend from opposite sides of the station), and thus a player can play on their own end or their partner's, and neither end becomes public until neither partner can play a tile. Scoring is also handled in pairs, with the player who went out scoring zero for their team (even though their partner will have dominoes remaining) and other teams summing their scores for a team score. =Elements of strategy= * It is generally in a player's best interest to keep their train private. By making a train public, the player allows other players to break an impasse in extending the train, but the player loses all other options except to attempt to play on the endpoint of their own train. * While public trains offer additional options, the player's own private train should be considered first. Trains are usually public because their owners cannot play on them; if that train's endpoint does not change, its owner has no options until they draw a domino they can play on it. * A player may choose to dump unmatched tiles on public trains first, before starting their own train, to trick the other players into believing that the player cannot start a train. * If one or more players played on a public train and the endpoint value has changed, play another tile that will change the endpoint value back to its original value or to a value the player is thought not to have. * It is sometimes advantageous to play a double on one's own train and intentionally leave it unfinished. If the value of the double has been heavily played elsewhere, other players may be unable to finish it, which will cause many players to have to mark their own trains. This is a good defensive play when subsequent players are low on dominoes; they are unlikely to have a matching domino, and must draw and mark their trains until someone can finish the double. * Because a player playing an unfinished double on someone else's train does not have to mark their own train as public, it is recommended that players play doubles on public trains whenever possible. Not only does this remove a major disadvantage to playing an unfinished double, it does not change the endpoint value of the train meaning its owner probably will not be able to play, and other players do have to mark their trains if they cannot finish the double. However double on another player's train gives that player and everyone else (if public) more options. Variations There are a number of other versions of the rules for Mexican train, varying the number of dominoes drawn by each player, the rules for playing doubles, or the number of tiles that can be played during one turn. For example: =Fast game variation= After the starting double has been placed, turns are ignored, and each player focuses on making their own train as long as possible. Once everyone has made as long of a train as they can, play reverts to turns, using the rules listed above. This speeds up the game, but eliminates some of the strategies of playing doubles. =Delayed first turn variation= Similar to the fast game variation listed above, instead of simultaneously, each person takes turns playing as many dominoes on their train as possible. Any player that is unable to play on their first turn draws a domino, and may then begin their first turn or pass. When a player who has passed finally starts their train, they may play as many dominoes as they can string together. After starting their train, players are only permitted to play one domino at a time as usual, unless playing a double. This version allows a player to save their \\"first turn\\" string of dominoes for when they have a chance, instead of being stuck with all dominoes from the beginning. =Branching doubles variation= Once a double has been satisfied, players may continue to branch off of the double in two more directions, meaning the double will have a matching endpoint on all four sides. Often, players like to angle these branches at a 45-degree angle to accommodate for more room. This variant gives players more choice and speeds up the game. =Swan drive variation= A player who can play on their own train may also play one tile on each subsequent public train in clockwise order. Each public train must be played on in order to continue in this manner, and only one tile per train may be played (unless a double must be finished). Once a player cannot play on the next public train, or has looped around to their own train, their turn ends. While playing on each public train, the player may choose to play on the Mexican train or skip it when he comes to it, making the placement of the train somewhat strategical. This version makes for a much faster game.

He began his career as a staff announcer in radio; Kennedy's voice narrates the opening of the television series Adventures of Superman. Early life and education Kennedy was born June 27, 1908 in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Career Kennedy began his media career as a staff announcer at WWJ, The Detroit News. In the 1940s, he became a Warner Bros. contract player, appearing in dozens of Hollywood movies from 1941 through 1955. He was often cast as a police officer or detective. He played Thierache, the Executioner, who sets fire to Joan (played by Ingrid Bergman) in Joan of Arc (1948), but recounted that after the picture previewed in a neighborhood popular with gays, his one line ‚Äì \\"We need more fagots\\" (a term referring to a bundle of sticks used to burn someone at the stake) ‚Äì generated loud laughter from the audience during the execution scene. He also played opposite Cary Grant in Destination Tokyo. For the Superman TV series, he was the announcer during its several year run. He appeared off-screen (uncredited) as the wrestling announcer in the 1952 episode, \\"No Holds Barred;\\" and on- screen, as one of the radio announcers (uncredited) in the 1953 episode, \\"Crime Wave\\"; and as the racetrack announcer in the 1955 episode \\"Joey\\". He is believed to have provided the voice on the phone for the 1954 episode, \\"Beware the Wrecker\\". Denver Pyle played the part on-screen and had a couple of spoken lines. Kennedy also appeared as a guest star in numerous series, such as The Lone Ranger, The Cisco Kid, The Gene Autry Show, and Death Valley Days. In 1956 Kennedy returned from California to the Detroit area as host of Bill Kennedy's Showtime at CKLW-TV, based directly across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario. The musical standard, \\"Just in Time\\" was his theme song. In 1969 he moved to WKBD and continued hosting the show, named Bill Kennedy at the Movies, until retiring to Florida in 1983. On his afternoon TV program, he showed old movies, and provided anecdotes about the actors and the production of the movies. These came in large part from his own Hollywood experience. He had a deadpan, sardonic style which many found refreshing, somewhat similar to that of Ed Sullivan. He expressed his opinion of the movies, making comments such as \\"We have a moderately good picture for you today\\". He introduced the featured film, Dragonwyck (1946), by saying, \\"Today we have one of the most boring movies ever made.\\" He took on-air calls from viewers, which was a highlight of his daily shows. When Kennedy showed a film in which he had a part, he would talk at every break about the role, but always with a wink and good humor. Kennedy would also interview stars of some of the movies that he would host when those stars would be visiting the Detroit area and include it with that days film broadcast. He died January 27, 1997 in Palm Beach, Florida of emphysema.

They were traditionally presented on the feast day of Corpus Christi (a movable feast on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday, between 23 May and 24 June) and were performed in the city of York, from the mid-fourteenth century until their suppression in 1569. The plays are one of four virtually complete surviving English mystery play cycles, along with the Chester Mystery Plays, the Towneley/Wakefield plays and the N-Town plays. Two long, composite, and late mystery pageants have survived from the Coventry cycle and there are records and fragments from other similar productions that took place elsewhere. A manuscript of the plays, probably dating from between 1463 and 1477, is still intact and stored at the British Library. Plays There is no record of the first performance of the mystery plays, but they were recorded as celebrating the festival of Corpus Christi in York in 1376, by which time the use of pageant wagons had already been established. The plays were organised, financed and performed by the York Craft Guilds (\\"Mystery\\" is a play on words, representing a religious truth or rite, and its Middle English meaning of a trade or craft). The wagons were paraded through the streets of York, stopping at 12 playing stations, designated by the city banners. The cycle uses many different verse forms, most have rhyme, a regular rhythm with fairly short lines and frequent alliteration. The balance of critical opinion is in favour of several clerics being responsible for their authorship, one of whom is conventionally known as the \\"York Realist\\". It comprises 48 pageants that were originally presented on carts and wagons dressed for the occasion. In some accounts there are as many as 56 pageants. They told stories from the Old and New Testaments, from the Creation to the Last Judgement. The plays continued after the Reformation when in 1548, the feast of Corpus Christi was abolished in England. The plays were accommodated in to the new religious orthodoxy by cutting scenes honouring the Virgin, but were suppressed in 1569. Traditionally, an individual guild took responsibility for a particular play. #Barkers (Tanners) ‚Äì The creation, and the Fall of Lucifer #Plasterers ‚Äì The creation ‚Äì to the Fifth Day #Cardmakers ‚Äì Creation of Adam and Eve #Fullers (preparers of woollen cloth) ‚Äì Adam and Eve in Eden #Coopers (makers of wooden casks) ‚Äì Fall of Man #Armourers ‚Äì Expulsion from Eden #Glovers ‚Äì Sacrifice of Cain and Abel #Shipwrights ‚Äì Building of the Ark #Fishers and Mariners ‚Äì Noah and his Wife #Parchmenters and Bookbinders ‚Äì Abraham and Isaac #Hosiers ‚Äì Departure of the Israelites from Egypt;Ten Plagues; Crossing the Red Sea #Spicers ‚Äì Annunciation and Visitation #Pewterers and Founders ‚Äì Joseph's trouble about Mary #Tile- thatchers ‚Äì Journey to Bethlehem, the Nativity of Jesus #Chandlers (Candlemakers) ‚Äì The Annunciation to the shepherds, the Adoration of the Shepherds #Masons ‚Äì Coming of the Three Kings to Herod #Goldsmiths ‚Äì Coming of the Kings: Adoration #Marshals (Grooms) ‚Äì Flight into Egypt #Girdlers and Nailers ‚Äì Massacre of the Innocents #Spurriers and Lorimers (Spurmakers and makers of horse bits and bridles) ‚Äì Christ with the Doctors #Barbers ‚Äì Baptism of Jesus #Smiths ‚Äì Temptation of Jesus #Curriers (men who dress leather) ‚Äì Transfiguration #Capmakers ‚Äì Woman Taken in Adultery; Raising of Lazarus #Skinners ‚Äì Jesus' entry into Jerusalem #Cutlers ‚Äì The conspiracy: Pilate, Annas, Caiaphas, Bargain of Judas #Bakers ‚Äì Last Supper #Cordwainers (Shoemakers) ‚Äì Agony, Betrayal and Arrest #Bowyers and Fletchers ‚Äì Denial of Peter; Jesus before Caiaphas #Tapiters (makers of tapestry and carpets) and Couchers ‚Äì Dream of Pilate's wife; Pilate's court #Listers (Dyers) ‚Äì Trial before Herod #Cooks and Water-leaders ‚Äì Second Accusation before Pilate; Remorse of Judas; Purchase of the Field of Blood #Tilemakers ‚Äì Second Trial before Pilate #Shearman ‚Äì Christ Led to Calvary #Pinners and Painters ‚Äì Crucifixion #Butchers ‚Äì Mortification of Christ; Burial #Saddlers ‚Äì Harrowing of Hell #Carpenters ‚Äì Resurrection # Winedrawers ‚Äì Christ's Appearance to Mary Magdalene #Sledmen ‚Äì Travellers to Emmaus #Hatmakers, Masons, Labourers ‚Äì Purification of Mary; Simeon and Anna #Scriveners (Scribes) ‚Äì Incredulity of Thomas #Tailors ‚Äì Ascension #Potters ‚Äì Descent of the Holy Spirit #Drapers (Dealers in cloth and dry goods) ‚Äì Death of Mary #Weavers ‚Äì Appearance of Mary to Thomas #Ostlers (Stablemen) ‚Äì Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin #Mercers (Dealers in textiles) ‚Äì Judgement Day The York Realist The authorship of the plays is unknown, but analysis of the style allows scholars to recognise where authorship changes. One group of plays, concerned with the Passion, has been attributed to a writer called \\"The York Realist\\", and the name has come into general use. The eight plays concerned are *Cutlers ‚Äì Conspiracy *Cordwainers (Shoemakers) ‚Äì Agony and Betrayal *Bowyers and Fletchers ‚Äì Peter's Denial; Jesus before Caiphas *Tapiters (Makers of tapestry and carpets) and Couchers ‚Äì Dream of Pilate's Wife *Listers (Dyers) ‚Äì Trial before Herod *Cooks and Water-leaders ‚Äì Second Accusation before Pilate; Remorse of Judas; Purchase of the Field of Blood *Tilemakers ‚Äì Second Trial before Pilate *Butchers ‚Äì Mortification of Christ; Burial They are all written in vigorous alliterative verse as are other plays in the cycle. The distinctive feature, apart from the high quality of the writing, is the attention to incidental detail in the story-telling and in the subtle portrayal of the negative characters: Pilate, Herod, Annas and Caiaphas. Playwright Peter Gill expressed the view that \\"If it hadn‚Äôt been for the York Realist, Shakespeare would have been a second rate writer like Goethe\\".The York Realist Modern revivals After their suppression in Tudor times, the plays remained little known until Lucy Toulmin Smith obtained permission from the Earl of Ashburnham to study the manuscript of the plays in his possession and publish her transcription together with an introduction and short glossary in 1885. In 1909, the York Historic Pageant included a parade of guild banners accompanying a wagon representing the Nativity through the streets.The Guilds of York ‚Äì York Mystery Plays site In December the same year a selection of six plays was performed as a fund-raising venture for St Olave's Church, York. The play cycle was revived on a much larger scale in 1951 in the York Festival of the Arts, part of the Festival of Britain celebrations. It was performed on a fixed stage in the ruins of St Mary's Abbey in the Museum Gardens and directed by E. Martin Browne. The music, written for the occasion by James Brown, was directed by Allan Wicks.York Mystery Plays musician and York Minster organist Allan Wicks has died, York Press, 11 February 2010. The part of Jesus was played by Joseph O'Conor,Alan Strachan, Joseph O'Conor obituary, The Independent, 2 February 2001 (although to preserve mystique he was not named in the programme) and other roles were taken by amateurs. In the interests of comprehensibility, the text was abbreviated and modernised by Canon Purvis who went on to lead the Borthwick Institute at the University of York,Purvis as Head of Borthwick Institute and produced a modernisation of the complete text. Following the success of the 1951 production, said to be \\"the most widely applauded festival event in the country, with over 26,000 people witnessing the Plays\\", selections from the cycle were staged in the same location at three-year intervals, lengthening to four-year intervals, until 1988. They have aroused academic interest and publications.Yorkshire Architectural and York Archaeological Society Usually directed by a professional and with a professional actor playing Jesus, the rest of the cast were local amateurs. Ian McShane played Lucifer/Satan in 1963. Some amateur actors such as Judi Dench became professionals. Directors included E. Martin Browne again (1954, 1957, 1966), David Giles (1960), William Gaskill (1963), Edward Taylor (1969, 1973), Jane Howell (1976), Patrick Garland (1980), Toby Robertson (1984) and Steven Pimlott (1988).

Meanwhile, 1975 saw the Graduate Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Leeds co-ordinating the staging of 42 pageants on the Leeds University campus.'Mystery Plays at Leeds', 50 Years of Medieval Studies at Leeds (2017). In 1992, the York production was moved in a modern production to the York Theatre Royal, with Robson Green playing Christ and a script adapted by Liz Lochhead. The 1996 production in the same place was all-amateur, with the part of Jesus played by local solicitor Rory Mulvihill, and the script shortened by Lochhead. For 2000, the interest of the Dean of York, Very Rev Raymond Furnell, led him to offer the use of York Minster for the most ambitious production so far. =York Millennium Mystery Plays= In 2000 a large-scale performance was staged in York Minster, as The York Millennium Mystery Plays, directed by Gregory Doran, with a script adapted by Mike Poulton. With Ray Stevenson in the role of Christ and Rory Mulvihill (Jesus in 1996) as Satan, the production was the most expensive and wide-reaching project in the history of the plays' modern revival. The first half began in heaven with the story of the fall of Lucifer, followed by the creation of the world, the fall of Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark (with impressive and memorable representations of the animals and the flood) and the story of Abraham and Isaac. From the New Testament there came the annunciation and nativity of Jesus, the massacre of the innocents, Christ's childhood, baptism, temptation and ministry, and his entrance into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. The second half concentrated on the capture and trial of Christ, and his crucifixion, resurrection and ascension. The production ended, as is traditional, with the Last Judgement.York Millennium Mystery Plays: Programme The production ran for a month, with a total audience of 28,000. Aside from the professional director and actor, Ray Stevenson, the cast was made up of amateurs, mainly from the York area. More than fifty children also took part. Original music was written for the production by local composer Richard Shephard. =2012 production= For 2012 the Mystery plays returned to the Museum Gardens, their home until 1988. The script was adapted by Mike Kenny and direction was by Damian Cruden of York Theatre Royal and Paul Burbridge of Riding Lights Theatre Company.York Mystery Plays 2012 website The show involved more than 1,000 local volunteers working alongside theatre professionals in all areas of the production, including 500 amateur actors organised into two casts who shared the 30-performance run. The combined role of Jesus and God the Father was played by Ferdinand Kingsley,York Press 24 May 2012BBC News North Yorkshire and Lucifer/Satan by Graeme Hawley.York Press 29 May 2012 Reviews for the production were generally positive, with praise for the spectacle and stage design as well as the efforts of the volunteers.York Mystery Plays 2012 review in The StageGuardian ‚Äì The Northerner ‚Äì York Mystery Plays 2012 review = 2016 production = In 2016 the plays were performed in York Minster from 26 May, the feast of Corpus Christi, until 30 June. The director, Phillip Breen, had previously directed for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production featured a large step set by designers Max Jones and Ruth Hall, that was dissected by a thin gauze that reached to the vaulted ceiling, which was utilised as a projection screen by projection designer Douglas O'Connell. https://www.yorkmix.com/review-york-minster-mystery-plays- with-10-pix/ Writer Mike Poulton and composer Richard Shephard repeated their millennium production roles. The cast had about 150 amateur actors and the sole professional, Philip McGinley, played Jesus except for the last four performances, when, owing to his sudden illness, the role was taken by his understudy Toby Gordon who had, up to then, played Satan. This caused a cascade of understudying which was superbly handled by a committed cast. It also elevated Toby Gordon into the ‚ÄòCrew of Two‚Äô with Rory Mulvihill as the only actors in the history of the plays to have played both Jesus and Satan. = Waggon plays = An experimental production using horse-drawn brewers‚Äô drays and market stalls, was performed around Leeds University, in 1975. In 1994 the Leeds-based historian Jane Oakshott worked alongside the Friends of York Mystery Plays, the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of York and the York Early Music Festival to direct the first processional performance of the plays in modern times in York. The production involved nine amateur drama groups each taking one play, and touring it to five playing stations in central York using pageant waggons.York Mystery Plays '94: Souvenir Programme A production in similar format in 1998 featured eleven plays, and for the first time the modern York Guilds were involved with some of the plays, either directly or as sponsors.York 1998 Mystery Plays: Programme Following the production in York Minster in 2000, the Waggon Plays were the only regular cycle performed in the city until 2012 when the static plays were revived. The Waggon Plays also used the Museum Gardens as a performance station maintaining the link between St Mary's Abbey and the plays established in the 1950s. For the 2002 production management transferred to a committee of the Guilds of York: the York Guild of Building, the Company of Merchant Taylors, the Company of Cordwainers, the Gild of Freemen, the Company of Butchers, the Guild of Scriveners and the Company of Merchant Adventurers. Ten plays were produced with the assistance of local drama groups.York Mystery Plays: 2002 Programme In 2006, twelve waggons performed in the streets, in conjunction with the York Early Music Festival.York Mystery Plays: 2006 Programme The 2010 production featured twelve waggons, performing at four stations.schedule for 2010 plays At the same time the only known surviving manuscript of the plays was displayed in York Art Gallery.Original manuscript of York Mystery Plays on show at York Art Gallery at yorkpress.co.uk Two plays (Creation and Noah's Ark) were performed on waggons at two stations in the York 800 celebrations in 2012. The performances on waggons were given again by the Guilds in 2014, continuing the established four-yearly cycle. 2018 saw the plays return to the streets of York once more, this time with a selection of 11 plays. = Language in modern productions = Modern performances use some degree of modernisation of the text, either by a radical policy of replacing all obsolete word and phrases by modern equivalents, or at least by using modern pronunciations. An exception is the productions of the Lords of Misrule, a dramatic groupLords of Misrule composed of students and recent graduates of the Department of Medieval Studies at the University of York.Centre for Medieval Studies Their presentations use authentic Middle English both in the words used and in their pronunciation. They have regularly contributed to one of the waggon play productions.  Editions  =The unaltered Middle English text= *The first publication was that of Lucy Toulmin Smith in 1885. This was republished in 1963 and again in 2007. *A century later Richard Beadle felt the time was ripe for re-examination of the manuscript, and he published a facsimile edition. *Beadle also published a transcription of the text with notes and glossary. This included many minor amendments to Toulmin Smith's work, but no major surprises. *Beadle's 1982 text has been put on-line at the University of Michigan.Beadle's original text at Michigan Because this has been constrained to use a modern alphabet, the obsolete letters thorn and yogh, which are correctly reproduced in the printed version, here appear as \\"th\\" and \\"yo\\" respectively. *More recently Beadle has revised and enhanced his work into two volumes, the first containing an introduction, the text and musical settings accompanying the plays and the second containing notes, glossary and discussion. *Clifford Davidson of the University of Rochester has published an edition which is also on-line. =Edition in modern spelling= *The version of Beadle and King contains a transcription of 22 of the plays into modern spelling. This is not unambiguously a benign process; where the modernisation involves the loss of a syllable it has just been dropped, which in general damages the scansion, for example is the Middle English word \\"withouten\\", which in this edition appears as \\"without\\". The Middle English ending \\"-and\\" for the present participle has been changed to the modern equivalent \\"-ing\\", but retained where the \\"-and\\" was required for a rhyme. =Modernised editions= *The first complete full modernisation was that of John Stanley Purvis, Canon of York, in 1951. *A more recent complete modernisation is that of Chester N.

Anatoli Petrovich Bugorski (), born 25 June 1942, is a retired Russian particle physicist. He is notable for surviving an accident in 1978, when a high energy proton beam from a particle accelerator passed through his brain.  Accident  As a researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino, Russia, Bugorski worked with the largest particle accelerator in the Soviet Union, the U-70 synchrotron. On 13 July 1978, Bugorski was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment when the safety mechanisms failed. Bugorski was leaning over the equipment when he stuck his head in the path of the 76 GeV proton beam. Reportedly, he saw a flash \\"brighter than a thousand suns\\" but did not feel any pain. The beam passed through the back of his head, the occipital and temporal lobes of his brain, the left middle ear, and out through the left hand side of his nose. He received a dose of 200,000 to 300,000 roentgens. Bugorski understood the severity of what had happened, but continued working on the malfunctioning equipment, and initially opted not to tell anyone what had happened.  Aftermath  The left half of Bugorski's face swelled up beyond recognition and, over the next several days, the skin started to peel, revealing the path that the proton beam (moving near the speed of light) had burned through parts of his face, his bone and the brain tissue underneath. As it was believed that he had received far in excess of a fatal dose of radiation, Bugorski was taken to a clinic in Moscow where the doctors could observe his expected demise. However, Bugorski survived, completed his PhD, and continued working as a particle physicist. There was virtually no damage to his intellectual capacity, but the fatigue of mental work increased markedly. Bugorski completely lost hearing in the left ear, replaced by a form of tinnitus. The left half of his face was paralyzed due to the destruction of nerves. He was able to function well, excepting occasional complex partial seizures and rare tonic-clonic seizures. Bugorski continued to work as a physicist at the Institute for High Energy Physics and held the post of coordinator of physics experiments. Because of the Soviet Union's policy of maintaining secrecy on nuclear power-related issues, Bugorski did not speak publicly about the accident for over a decade. He continued going to the Moscow radiation clinic twice a year for examinations and to meet with other nuclear-accident victims. He was described as \\"a poster boy for Soviet and Russian radiation medicine\\". In 1996, he applied unsuccessfully for disability status to receive free epilepsy medication. Bugorski showed interest in making himself available for study to Western researchers but could not afford to leave Protvino. Personal life Bugorski is married to Vera Nikolaevna, and they had a son, Peter.

He was born at Izernore. Life He was instructed in reading and writing by his father, who had become a priest, and at the age of seven was given to Saint Romanus and Saint Lupicinus to be educated at Condat Abbey. Thenceforth he never left the monastery. Eugendus acquired much learning, read the Greek and Latin authors, and was well versed in the Scriptures. He led a life of great austerity, including being said to have never laughed, supposedly in respect to a passage in the Rule of St Benedict not to take pleasure in unrestrained or raucous laughter (despite the fact that St. Benedict was born thirty years after him and would scarcely have been known at the time of Eugendus' death). He also refused ever to be ordained a priest. Abbot Minausius made him his coadjutor, and after the former's death (about 496) Eugendus became his successor. After the monastery, which Saint Romanus had built of wood, was destroyed by fire, Eugendus erected another of stone, and improved the community life; thus far the brethren had lived in separate cells after the fashion of the Eastern ascetics. He built an abbey church in honour of the holy Apostles Peter, Paul, and Andrew, and enriched it with precious relics; the church was the predecessor of the rebuilt abbey church that is now Saint-Claude Cathedral The order, which had been founded on the rules of the Oriental monasteries, now took on more of the active character of the Western brethren; the rule of Tarnate is thought to have served as a model. Condat began to flourish as a place of refuge for all those who suffered from the misfortunes and afflictions of those eventful times, a school of virtue and knowledge amid the surrounding darkness, an oasis in the desert. When Eugendus felt his end approaching he had his breast anointed by a priest, took leave of his brethren, and died quietly after five days, at the age of sixty-one. Veneration A few years after his death, his successor, Saint Viventiolus, erected a shrine over his tomb in the abbey church, to which numerous pilgrims travelled. The village that grew round Condat Abbey came to be called, after the saint, Saint-Oyand de Joux, a name it retained as late as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, while the abbey's former name of Condat passed into oblivion; the abbey was secularised in 1742.However, Saint Claudius of Besan√ßon, who had resigned in 687 as Bishop of Besan√ßon to become twelfth abbot, died at the abbey in 696. His grave became such a popular centre of pilgrimage that by the thirteenth century, the use of the name \\"Saint-Claude\\" had become general, and eventually superseded that of Saint-Oyand, so that the place is now known as Saint-Claude and gave its name to the Diocese of Saint-Claude The feast of Saint Eugendus was at first transferred to 2 January; in the dioceses of Besan√ßon and Saint-Claude it is now celebrated on 4 January.

Among these are the naive forms of helper T cells (CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+). A naive T cell is considered immature and, unlike activated or memory T cells, has not encountered its cognate antigen within the periphery.  Phenotype  Naive T cells are commonly characterized by the surface expression of L-selectin (CD62L) and C-C Chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7); the absence of the activation markers CD25, CD44 or CD69; and the absence of memory CD45RO isoform. They also express functional IL-7 receptors, consisting of subunits IL-7 receptor-Œ±, CD127, and common-Œ≥ chain, CD132. In the naive state, T cells are thought to require the common-gamma chain cytokines IL-7 and IL-15 for homeostatic survival mechanisms. While naive T cells are regularly regarded as a developmentally synchronized and fairly homogeneous and quiescent cell population, only differing in T cell receptor specificity, there is increasing evidence that naive T cells are actually heterogeneous in phenotype, function, dynamics and differentiation status, resulting in a whole spectrum of naive cells with different properties. For instance, some non-naive T cells express surface markers similar to naive T cells (Tscm, stem cell memory T cells; Tmp, memory T cells with a naive phenotype), some antigen-naive T cells have lost their naive phenotype, and some T cells are incorporated within the naive T cell phenotype but are a different T cell subset (Treg, regulatory T cells; RTE, Recent Thymic emigrant). It is important to appreciate these differences when assessing naive T cells. Majority of human naive T cells are produced very early in life when infant's thymus is large and functional. Decrease in naive T cell production due to involution of the thymus with age is compensated by so called \\"peripheral proliferation\\" or \\"homeostatic proliferation\\" of naive T cells which have emigrated from the thymus earlier in life. The homeostatic proliferation causes change to naive T cell gene expression and i.e. is manifested by acquisition of CD25 surface protein expression.  Function  Naive T cells can respond to novel pathogens that the immune system has not yet encountered. Recognition by a naive T cell clone of its cognate antigen results in the initiation of an immune response. In turn, this results in the T cell acquiring an activated phenotype seen by the up-regulation of surface markers CD25+, CD44+, CD62Llow, CD69+ and may further differentiate into a memory T cell. Having adequate numbers of naive T cells is essential for the immune system to continuously respond to unfamiliar pathogens.  Mechanism of activation  When a recognized antigen binds to the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) located in the cell membrane of Th0 cells, these cells are activated through the following \\"classical\\" signal transduction cascade: * the tyrosine kinase Lck which is associated with co-receptors CD4 and CD8: is engaged to phosphorylate the CD3 coreceptor complex and Œ∂-chains of the TCR and to recruit and activate the Œ∂-chain- associated protein Zap70 * activated Zap70 in turn phosphorylates the membrane adaptor Lat, which subsequently recruits several Src homology domain‚Äìcontaining proteins, including phospholipase C-Œ≥1 (PLC-Œ≥1) * activation of PLC-Œ≥1 results in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol * inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate triggers release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C and RasGRP * RasGRP in turn activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade which An alternative \\"non-classical\\" pathway involves activated Zap70 directly phosphorylating the p38 MAPK that in turn induces the expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Furthermore, the expression of PLC-Œ≥1 is dependent on VDR activated by calcitriol. Naive T cells have very low expression of VDR and PLC-Œ≥1. However, activated TCR signaling through p38 upregulates VDR expression and calcitriol activated VDR, in turn, upregulates PLC-Œ≥1 expression. Hence the activation of naive T cells is crucially dependent on adequate calcitriol levels. In summary, activation of T cells first requires activation through the non-classical pathway to increase expression of VDR and PLC-Œ≥1 before activation through the classical pathway can proceed. This provides a delayed response mechanism where the innate immune system is allowed time (~48 hrs) to clear an infection before the inflammatory T cell mediated adaptive immune response kicks in.

Ugochukwu served as the senior Special Adviser on Communication to Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and the first Executive Chairman of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). On 25 February 2008, an Abia State elections tribunal declared Ugochukwu the winner of the 2007 gubernatorial election and Governor-elect of Abia State. However, on 11 February 2009 an appeal court in Port Harcourt overturned the ruling, declaring that Theodore Orji of the PPA had in fact won the election. Early life Onyema Ugochukwu was born on 9 November 1944 in Umuahia, Abia State, Nigeria. He graduated from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, with a BSc in Economics. He is married with four children. Biafran War The political turmoil which followed the first military coup in 1966 escalated into a civil war when the south-east region of Nigeria seceded as the Republic of Biafra a year later. Ugochukwu enlisted in the Biafran Army and rose to the rank of captain before the war ended in 1970. Career =Economics= Ugochukwu (right) with British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher (center), and Yemi Ogunbiyi (left) at 10 Downing Street Upon graduation from college, Ugochukwu was hired as an Economic Research Assistant by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He remained with CBN for two years before he abandoned a promising career in economics to pursue his true passion, journalism. =Journalism= Ugochukwu joined the Business Times group as an Economic Analyst and a pioneer staff of what would later become the most influential financial newspaper in Nigeria. Ugochukwu rose in the ranks to become the Editor of the Business Times newspaper (1977 to 1982). In 1983, Ugochukwu became Editor in Chief of the London-based West Africa magazine, where he wrote extensively on development issues, to provide a better understanding of the African debt crisis. He eventually returned to Nigeria to become the Editor in Chief of the Daily Times of Nigeria and he was subsequently appointed to its board as the Executive Director of Manpower and Development. He retired from newspaper journalism in 1994 as the Executive Director of Publications. Ugochukwu remained active as a media consultant for the Dow Jones Financial News Service. Throughout his distinguished career as a journalist, Ugochukwu has met and interviewed numerous Heads of States ‚Äì including then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, South African President Nelson Mandela, Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, French President Jacques Chirac, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, Nigerian presidents Ibrahim Babangida, Muhammadu Buhari, Sani Abacha, and Abdusalami Abubakar ‚Äì and presented papers on African economic and political development at various forums including Oxford University, England, and Uppsala University. Politics Ugochukwu with United States President, Bill Clinton With Nigeria's return to democracy in 1998, Ugochukwu became the Director of Publicity at the \\"Obasanjo for President\\" Campaign Organisation, and contributed immensely to the election of Olusegun Obasanjo as the President of Nigeria. Ugochukwu was appointed as the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Orientation and Public Affairs. He spearheaded a \\"National Rebirth\\" campaign aimed at instilling patriotic virtues into a national psyche ravaged by years of political instability and corruption. It was on this platform that Ugochukwu launched \\"The Nigerian Declaration of Human Responsibilities\\", which declares in part: \\"This Character on Human Responsibilities‚Ä¶ Seeks to bring freedom and responsibility into a better balance, to highlight and increase awareness of the obligation which we owe each other and to our nation.\\" =Niger Delta crisis= To soothe the political unrest in the oil-rich Niger Delta region of southern Nigeria, President Obasanjo signed the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) act of 2000 into law. Ugochukwu was appointed as the pioneer chairman of the newly created commission, charged with developing the nine oil producing states of the country, with excess oil revenues. Ugochukwu helped to articulate the president's vision of sustainable development in the Niger Delta region, and developed a policy which encouraged partnership amongst its stakeholders‚ÄîNiger-delta communities and their tribal chiefs, youth militia, oil companies and their executives, the Nigerian government, and Non- Government Organizations, and international organisations like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank. During Ugochukwu's tenure, the NDDC focused mainly on economic revival and prosperity, environmental rehabilitation, and the development of social and physical infrastructure. =Campaign for Abia Rebirth (CARE)= Ugochukwu (center) with Cuban President Fidel Castro, at Jos√© Mart√≠ International Airport, Havana, Cuba. At the end of his four-year tenure at NDDC, Ugochukwu returned to Abuja and continued to serve as the President's Special Adviser on Communications. He took an interest in state politics, and resigned from office to join the Abia State gubernatorial race. In 2006, the Campaign for Abia Rebirth (CARE) was launched, with a promise to rebuild the state. On 13 December 2006, Ugochukwu emerged as the People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the 2007 Abia State gubernatorial elections. The hotly contested race was marred by allegations of electoral malpractice, and violence, all of which culminated in the election of Ugochukwu's rival, Theodore Orji of the Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA). Assassination attempt There was an attempt on Ugochukwu's life during the Abia State Gubernatorial elections on 14 April 2007. The assailants fired shots at his motorcade, fatally wounding one of his State Security Service (SSS) bodyguards, who suffered gunshot wounds through his head and hands. Ugochukwu, the PDP candidate and frontrunner in the election, blamed the attack on his political opponents in the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA). Election Petition Tribunal Ugochukwu sought redress at the Abia State Election Petition Tribunal. Governor Theodore Orji's election was annulled on 25 February 2008, on the grounds that he was ineligible to contest for the office. Orji and his deputy had failed to resign their respective positions in the Abia State government, 30 days prior to the election as stipulated in the 1999 Constitution. The Tribunal also cited Governor Orji's failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, his affiliation with a secret cult. Ugochukwu was thus declared the lawful winner of the April 2007 gubernatorial election, and Governor-elect of Abia State ‚Äì pending the outcome at the Port Harcourt Appeals Court. However, on 11 February 2009 an appeal court in Port Harcourt overturned the ruling, declaring that Theodore Orji of the PPA had in fact won the election.

The tests are intended to be run only once, unless a defect is discovered. Ad hoc testing is the least formal test method. As such, it has been criticized because it is not structured and hence defects found using this method may be harder to reproduce (since there are no written test cases). However, the strength of ad hoc testing is that important defects can be found quickly. It is performed by improvisation: the tester seeks to find bugs by any means that seem appropriate.

Like Sorry!, it is played with playing cards rather than dice.  Overview  Tock is a Cross and Circle game in the style of Pachisi, an Indian game played since the first millennium BC. Tock's exact origins are unclear, but traditionally it is believed that it originated with the early settlers of Quebec, Canada. From Quebec, the game \\"Jeu du Toc (Tock)\\" moved to France where it is also known as \\"Jeu des petits chevaux canadiens\\". Tock is also similar to the French game \\"Jeu des petits chevaux\\", where moves are determined by throwing dice instead of playing cards. Petits-Chevaux (Little Horses)  Variations  Some versions of the game use pawns or \\"men\\" as tokens; other versions use marbles instead, which advance on a wooden board with circular indentations in it to hold the marbles. While the game is designed on the basis of a French deck of cards with jokers removed; there are some versions that do use the jokers (54-Cards Game), or that come with cards specially made for the game that depict the actions they allow.  Rules overview  At the beginning of each round players are dealt a number of cards which they play in turns to move their tokens around the board. If at any time a token lands exactly on the field occupied by another token then the moved token replaces the resting one (which is placed back into the corresponding player's starting area). If a player on his turn has no cards he can play with his tokens (or which he can't play against the other players, like a 5, 10 or Queen in some variations) then he must discard his entire remaining hand and wait for the next hand to be dealt. A starter is a card that allows a player to move a new token to the starting field. Aces and Kings (and Jokers in some variations) are starters. A token at the starting field is immune to capture or swapping by an opponent, and additionally it creates a blockade. No players can pass a token that is on its starting field, either forward or backwards (with a 4) with the exception of a Joker In the simplest form of the game, the cards only provide a single specific number of fields to move forward. However, Tock has many (even more popular) variations where some cards have special functions, that make the game more challenging and interesting. Any combination of card functions can be used in play. Just ensure every player is aware of all the options to be used in play prior to the game. To make it \\"home\\", a player needs the exact count of fields, and they need to fill the house from the top down. Tokens are not allowed to jump over other tokens within the house. = Card functions = Basic functions of cards are: ; Ace: Can be used as 1, or as a starter. ; Jack: Makes a move of 11 fields. ; Queen: Makes a move of 12 fields. ; King: Can be used to move 13 fields after all token are out, as a starter. The following are also commonly used: ; 4: Move four fields backward. Players are allowed to go backwards from their starting point and then into Home on a subsequent turn. But moving backwards straight into Home is not allowed. ; 5: Players can force move any player forward 5. ; 7: Make 7 individual moves of one field. These moves can be freely distributed among all of his tokens. ; Jack: Make a move of 11 fields or may swap one of his own tokens with any other token (opponent's or his own) on the circle track. = Team variants = Aside from a \\"Free for all\\" play style the game also supports a variety of team based modes. Common to all team based variations is that once a team member has managed to bring all of his tokens home he helps move his partners' tokens. If the first player to get all marbles home plays a seven, the remainder can be used to move the partners marbles. Also after every hand is dealt the team members exchange one card with each other. * Two versus two players standard - Players on opposite sides of the board team up. * Three versus three players - On a six player board the teams' players are placed in alternating order around the board. Each team member exchanges card with every other team member when a new hand is dealt. * Two versus two players extended - On a six player board each team will receive an additional common color of tokens. The teams are placed like in a 3 vs 3 game. Each player may move with his own or the common color. * Two vs. Two vs. Two players - Players on opposite sides of the board team up. This variant is more \\"cutthroat\\" than the other team based variants because there are more hostile turns than friendly turns in every round.

Brown, of Galion, Ohio, was consecrated a bishop of the Episcopal Church, but is best remembered as the first Episcopal bishop to be tried for heresy since the Reformation, and the first of any creed in America to be deposed for heretical teachings. He later became a bishop in the Old Catholic Church. Biography William Montgomery Brown was born on September 4, 1855, on a farm west of Orrville, Ohio, the son of a Joseph Morrison and Lucina Elzina Cary Brown. His father was a tenant farmer who moved the family to Michigan in 1858, and later enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War. Joseph Brown served in Tennessee before becoming ill, and was sent home to recuperate. He died on August 1, 1862. His mother moved the family back to Ohio, and \\"Willy\\" was \\"hired out\\" to a farmer who did not treat the boy well and neglected to provide for his education.\\"Bishop Brown\\", Galion Historical Society When Willy was 15, the county placed him with a farmer named Jacob Gardner, a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Gardner's piety greatly influenced young Brown. During this time he became seriously ill with typhoid fever. Years later Brown recalled making a bargain with God to devote his life to the ministry if his life would be spared. His health improved and he saved enough from the money his foster parents paid him to leave Ohio just after his 21st birthday. In 1876, Brown traveled to Omaha, Nebraska and got a job driving a carriage for a judge, who arranged for Brown to enter public school. After graduating, Brown returned to Ohio and worked in a tannery. Philanthropist Mary Scranton Bradford agreed to underwrite his education at the Episcopal Seminary, Bexley Hall, at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Mrs. Bradford sent him to Seabury Divinity School in Minnesota from 1879 to 1880 so he could prepare for the seminary course. He finished his studies in 1883, but because he did not take all of his courses at Kenyon, he never received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Bexley. Brown was ordained and in 1883, became vicar of Grace Church in Galion, Ohio. In 1891, he became the archdeacon for missionary work in the Diocese of Ohio and wrote his popular The Church for Americans, which explained the beliefs of the Episcopal Church. This placed him in the national spotlight. He was consecrated assistant bishop of Arkansas in 1898 and succeeded to the bishopric after the death of Henry Niles Pierce.Carden, Ronald M., \\"William Montgomery Brown (1855‚Äì1937)\\", Encyclopedia of Arkansas Also in 1898, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from Kenyon College. His 1907 book The Crucial Race Question, which supported the segregation of the races, greatly angered the Northerners who usually contributed substantial sums to support his poor diocese. Brown created the Helen Dunlap School for Mountain Girls and a seminary to train a local ministry in Arkansas. From 1909 to 1910, he engaged in a sharp conflict with Trinity Cathedral in Little Rock (Pulaski County) over the issue of control over the cathedral and the refusal of the dean to read and compliment the bishop‚Äôs new book, The Level Plan of Church Union. This dispute further alienated many in Arkansas. The Level Plan rejected many practices of the Episcopal Church and angered many supporters, who promptly insisted that he leave. In 1911, he returned to Galion, Ohio, and formally resigned as bishop of Arkansas in 1912, although he remained a bishop without a diocese. He was succeeded as Bishop of Arkansas by James Rideout Winchester. Brown began reading Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, and other authors promoting a materialistic view of the world. Two years later, Brown announced his \\"conversion to science\\" in July 1913. He wrote to Episcopal bishops informing them of his new position. He rejected the historical Jesus. \\"I no longer believed in a personal God, nor in a six-day creation, nor in a literal heaven and hell,\\" Brown wrote. Creeds, he decided, were merely symbolical.Mayr, Bill. \\"The Red Bishop\\", Kenyon College Alumni Bulletin, Vol.34, No.1, Fall 2011 Brown's evolution from Bishop of Arkansas (1899‚Äì1912), to finding an interest in Marxism, socialism, and Communism during the 1910s, to author of Communism and Christianism (1920), dramatically increased and challenged his influence in the church. It led to his heresy trial by the House of Bishops in 1924‚Äì25. There he tried to prove to his fellow bishops that they did not believe in a strict interpretation of the Bible any more than he then did. Nonetheless, Brown was deposed and excommunicated. However, while awaiting the final verdict on his deposition as bishop in October 1925, he was offered a place in both the Russian Orthodox Church, which was heavily influenced by Soviet authorities at the time, and the Old Catholic Church. He opted for the latter and was consecrated an Old Catholic bishop in a ceremony conducted in his own study in Galion. Because Old Catholic orders were accepted as valid by the Episcopal Church in the United States, Bishop Brown's position as a bishop in apostolic succession could not be challenged by his former church. Many Old Catholic churches count Bishop Brown in the line of succession of their bishops. Brown felt that his real ministry began at age 71 when he started lecturing to the working class and writing a wider variety of books. When he encountered difficulty in finding a publisher, he published himself under the Bradford Brown Educational Company, Inc. He continued to write until his death in 1937 at the age of 82. Bishop Brown is buried beside his wife in Galion's Fairview Cemetery. His will left bequests to the Galion hospital and to Kenyon College.

Mrs. Bradford had Brownella Cottage built, across the street from Grace Church, as a wedding present for the couple. A brick structure from 1866 that had originally been used as St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church was preserved on the site to serve as William‚Äôs study. Brownella Cottage was completed in 1887. The house reflected both the Bradford wealth and the high style of 1880s architecture in the United States. Ella Brown died in 1935; the bishop on October 31, 1937. Brownella Cottage is owned by the Galion Historical Society, which operates it as part monument to Brown, part museum for the town of Galion. The ghosts of both Ella and William Brown are purported to haunt Brownella Cottage. It has been said that every Halloween night one can see the ghost of the bishop walking the glass causeway between the house and the study. One individual taking the guided tour reported smelling pipe smoke even though there were no pipe smokers present.Hill, Todd. \\"Do you believe in ghosts?\\", Mansfield News Journal, October 31, 2014 The building has had many visitors, particularly around Halloween, who are drawn to the story of ghosts allegedly inhabiting the building.Galion Historical Society The My Ghost Story television program ran an episode on Brownella Cottage offering accounts of several people claiming encounters with what they thought may have been a ghost.

Critics often compare his music to that of Albert Ayler, although Wright \\"offers his honks and squawks with a phraseology derived from the slower, earthier funk of R&B; and gospel music.\\" According to AllMusic biographer Chris Kelsey, Wright \\"never recorded even a single record under his own name for a major label; he was 'underground' his entire career.\\" In addition to tenor saxophone, Wright also played the soprano saxophone and bass clarinet. Biography Wright was born in Grenada, Mississippi and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee and Cleveland, Ohio, where he began his musical career playing bass guitar, backing artists such as Rosco Gordon, Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, and B.B. King. He switched to tenor saxophone after meeting Albert Ayler in Cleveland, Ayler's hometown. In 1964, Wright moved to New York City, where he played with Larry Young, Noah Howard, and Sunny Murray. He also sat in with John Coltrane and, in early 1965, was invited to participate in the recording of Ascension, but reportedly felt that his skills were not up to the demands of the music. (Later, however, Wright stated \\"what I do is countersigned by master John Coltrane who accepted me at this side by calling me 'little brother'.\\") In late 1965, Wright recorded Frank Wright Trio, his first album as a leader, for ESP-Disk with Henry Grimes on bass and Tom Price on drums. (According to Bernard Stollman, founder of ESP-Disk, the record came about when he approached Wright after hearing him sit in with Coltrane. When Wright stated that he was not associated with a record label, Stollman declared \\"Well, you are now.\\") In 1966, while in Cleveland, he recorded with Albert Ayler's group, which at the time included Donald Ayler, Michael Samson, Muntawef Shaheed, and Ronald Shannon Jackson. The tracks remained unreleased until 2004, when they appeared on Holy Ghost: Rare & Unissued Recordings (1962‚Äì70). Wright's second album, Your Prayer, was recorded in 1967 and was also released by ESP-Disk. In 1968, Wright briefly joined Cecil Taylor's group, which also included Eddie Gale, Jimmy Lyons, Alan Silva, and Andrew Cyrille, for a tour of the west coast of the United States, where the group had a residency at Stanford University, performed at the Berkeley Jazz Festival, and opened for The Yardbirds at the Fillmore West. In 1969, Wright moved to Europe and settled in Paris, where he formed and recorded with The Frank Wright Quartet, featuring Noah Howard, Bobby Few, and Muhammad Ali. In the early 1970s, Howard left and was replaced by Alan Silva, at which time the group changed its name to The Center of the World Quartet at Silva's suggestion. The group also established a label called Center of the World Records as well as a distribution company called Sun Records. In 1971, Wright briefly moved back to the United States, but then returned to France, where he continued to record and tour with a variety of musicians. In 1984, he joined Cecil Taylor's Orchestra of Two Continents, touring Europe and recording Winged Serpent (Sliding Quadrants). He also recorded Olu Iwa with Taylor in 1986. During this time he also performed and recorded with German visual artist and drummer A. R. Penck. In 1988, he joined the Art Ensemble of Chicago for a concert at the Petrillo Bandshell in Chicago. Wright died in Germany in 1990. Wright was an ordained minister, and was known as \\"Reverend Frank Wright, a title of veneration universally bestowed upon the saxophonist by his peers in recognition of his spiritual approach to music, as well as his fervent style of improvisation.\\" Style and Influence Chris Kelsey wrote that \\"Ayler's scalding abstract expressionism was the prime influence on Wright, who transformed it with his own personality and passed it on.\\" Kelsey also noted that \\"Echoes of Wright's playing can be heard in the work of such younger saxophonists as Glenn Spearman, Sabir Mateen, Charles Gayle, and Thomas Borgmann.\\" Writing in the New York Times, reviewer Robert Palmer wrote that Wright's music \\"was sometimes referred to as 'energy music' during the 1960s, and although the term is vague... it is appropriate in Mr. Wright's case. The saxophonist sometimes seems to get so caught up in the physicality of his playing that he breaks into little dance steps in the middle of a solo.\\" Palmer continued: \\"Mr. Wright has remained faithful to the rowdy, celebratory essence of what might be called the Cleveland style... the combination of maturity and power in his playing comes as something of a shock.\\" Peter Br√∂tzmann recalled that Wright \\"was a wild man, in a good sense: made music and lived life in his own way. He was one of the first black Americans we got to know really well, and we all learned a lot from that.\\" Discography =As leader= * Frank Wright Trio (ESP-Disk, 1966) with Henry Grimes (bass) and Tom Price (drums) * Your Prayer (ESP-Disk, 1967) with Arthur Jones (alto sax), Jacques Coursil (trumpet), Steve Tintweiss (bass), and Muhammad Ali (drums) * Uhuru na Umoja (America, 1970) with Noah Howard (alto sax), Bobby Few (piano), and Arthur Taylor (drums) * One for John (BYG, 1970) with Noah Howard (alto sax), Bobby Few (piano), and Muhammad Ali (drums) * Church Number Nine (Odeon, 1971) with Noah Howard (alto sax), Bobby Few (piano), and Muhammad Ali (drums) * Center of the World (Center of the World, 1972) with Bobby Few (piano), Alan Silva (bass), and Muhammad Ali (drums) * Last Polka in Nancy?

Snowfall may have occurred elsewhere, but settler population was sparse outside of New England at that time.

At some points, the snow would lighten and stop, but the sky would remain cloudy, showing no signs of clearing. Some of the oldest Native Americans had said that even their ancestors never spoke of a storm of this magnitude.Perley, pg. 33 Boston received around of snow, while some places north of the city reached up to . In Hampton, Massachusetts, the snow was so deep that people could only leave their houses from the second floor on the lee side of the house, implying actual snow depths of as much as or more. Many single-story homes were buried completely, without even the chimney showing. On the larger residences, drifts reached the third-story window on the windward side. Large expanses of snow were deep, with some significant drifts deep. The post roads were impassable until at least March 15, with the mailmen describing snow drifts from Boston to Portsmouth more than a week after the storm. Travel was also impossible for a time from New York City to Boston.Have Snow Shovel, Will Travel Accessed 2009-02-03. The geographic scope of the storm is unknown, due to the scarce population and poor record-keeping of the day. Most information is known only from private diaries. The snow was known to be several feet deep around Philadelphia, New York City, New London, Connecticut, Boston and Portsmouth, New Hampshire.Perley, pg. 35Burt and Stroud, pg. 90 Damage and losses Many livestock lost their lives, either starving or freezing to death under tremendous drifts of snow. As many as 90-95% of the deer in the area died, either from starvation or predators, leading to many towns appointing \\"deer- reeves\\" to ensure their preservation.Perley, pg. 34 Many orchards were damaged, since the snow covered even the tops of many trees, and animals would graze among the upper branches where they usually could not.

This stems from Rudolf Clausius' 1862 assertion that any thermodynamic process always \\"admits to being reduced [reduction] to the alteration in some way or another of the arrangement of the constituent parts of the working body\\" and that internal work associated with these alterations is quantified energetically by a measure of \\"entropy\\" change, according to the following differential expression:Mechanical Theory of Heat ‚Äì Nine Memoirs on the development of concept of \\"Entropy\\" by Rudolf Clausius [1850-1865] :\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} \\\\ge 0 where Q = motional energy (‚Äúheat‚Äù) that is transferred reversibly to the system from the surroundings and T = the absolute temperature at which the transfer occurs In the years to follow, Ludwig Boltzmann translated these 'alterations of arrangement' into a probabilistic view of order and disorder in gas-phase molecular systems. In the context of entropy, \\"perfect internal disorder\\" has often been regarded as describing thermodynamic equilibrium, but since the thermodynamic concept is so far from everyday thinking, the use of the term in physics and chemistry has caused much confusion and misunderstanding. In recent years, to interpret the concept of entropy, by further describing the 'alterations of arrangement', there has been a shift away from the words 'order' and 'disorder', to words such as 'spread' and 'dispersal'. History This \\"molecular ordering\\" entropy perspective traces its origins to molecular movement interpretations developed by Rudolf Clausius in the 1850s, particularly with his 1862 visual conception of molecular disgregation. Similarly, in 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by Clausius, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range. This was the first-ever statistical law in physics. In 1864, Ludwig Boltzmann, a young student in Vienna, came across Maxwell‚Äôs paper and was so inspired by it that he spent much of his long and distinguished life developing the subject further. Later, Boltzmann, in efforts to develop a kinetic theory for the behavior of a gas, applied the laws of probability to Maxwell's and Clausius' molecular interpretation of entropy so as to begin to interpret entropy in terms of order and disorder. Similarly, in 1882 Hermann von Helmholtz used the word \\"Unordnung\\" (disorder) to describe entropy. Overview To highlight the fact that order and disorder are commonly understood to be measured in terms of entropy, below are current science encyclopedia and science dictionary definitions of entropy: *A measure of the unavailability of a system‚Äôs energy to do work; also a measure of disorder; the higher the entropy the greater the disorder.Oxford Dictionary of Science, 2005 *A measure of disorder; the higher the entropy the greater the disorder.Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry, 2004 *In thermodynamics, a parameter representing the state of disorder of a system at the atomic, ionic, or molecular level; the greater the disorder the higher the entropy.Barnes & Noble's Essential Dictionary of Science, 2004 *A measure of disorder in the universe or of the unavailability of the energy in a system to do work.Gribbin's Encyclopedia of Particle Physics, 2000 Entropy and disorder also have associations with equilibrium.Landsberg, P.T. (1984). ‚ÄúIs Equilibrium always an Entropy Maximum?‚Äù J. Stat. Physics 35: 159‚Äì69. Technically, entropy, from this perspective, is defined as a thermodynamic property which serves as a measure of how close a system is to equilibrium ‚Äî that is, to perfect internal disorder.Microsoft Encarta 2006. ¬© 1993-2005 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Likewise, the value of the entropy of a distribution of atoms and molecules in a thermodynamic system is a measure of the disorder in the arrangements of its particles. In a stretched out piece of rubber, for example, the arrangement of the molecules of its structure has an ‚Äúordered‚Äù distribution and has zero entropy, while the ‚Äúdisordered‚Äù kinky distribution of the atoms and molecules in the rubber in the non-stretched state has positive entropy. Similarly, in a gas, the order is perfect and the measure of entropy of the system has its lowest value when all the molecules are in one place, whereas when more points are occupied the gas is all the more disorderly and the measure of the entropy of the system has its largest value. In systems ecology, as another example, the entropy of a collection of items comprising a system is defined as a measure of their disorder or equivalently the relative likelihood of the instantaneous configuration of the items. Moreover, according to theoretical ecologist and chemical engineer Robert Ulanowicz, ‚Äúthat entropy might provide a quantification of the heretofore subjective notion of disorder has spawned innumerable scientific and philosophical narratives.‚Äù In particular, many biologists have taken to speaking in terms of the entropy of an organism, or about its antonym negentropy, as a measure of the structural order within an organism. The mathematical basis with respect to the association entropy has with order and disorder began, essentially, with the famous Boltzmann formula, S = k_\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\ln W \\\\\\\\! , which relates entropy S to the number of possible states W in which a system can be found. As an example, consider a box that is divided into two sections. What is the probability that a certain number, or all of the particles, will be found in one section versus the other when the particles are randomly allocated to different places within the box? If you only have one particle, then that system of one particle can subsist in two states, one side of the box versus the other. If you have more than one particle, or define states as being further locational subdivisions of the box, the entropy is larger because the number of states is greater. The relationship between entropy, order, and disorder in the Boltzmann equation is so clear among physicists that according to the views of thermodynamic ecologists Sven Jorgensen and Yuri Svirezhev, ‚Äúit is obvious that entropy is a measure of order or, most likely, disorder in the system.‚Äù In this direction, the second law of thermodynamics, as famously enunciated by Rudolf Clausius in 1865, states that: Thus, if entropy is associated with disorder and if the entropy of the universe is headed towards maximal entropy, then many are often puzzled as to the nature of the \\"ordering\\" process and operation of evolution in relation to Clausius' most famous version of the second law, which states that the universe is headed towards maximal ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù. In the recent 2003 book SYNC ‚Äì the Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order by Steven Strogatz, for example, we find ‚ÄúScientists have often been baffled by the existence of spontaneous order in the universe. The laws of thermodynamics seem to dictate the opposite, that nature should inexorably degenerate toward a state of greater disorder, greater entropy. Yet all around us we see magnificent structures‚Äîgalaxies, cells, ecosystems, human beings‚Äîthat have all somehow managed to assemble themselves.‚Äù The common argument used to explain this is that, locally, entropy can be lowered by external action, e.g. solar heating action, and that this applies to machines, such as a refrigerator, where the entropy in the cold chamber is being reduced, to growing crystals, and to living organisms. This local increase in order is, however, only possible at the expense of an entropy increase in the surroundings; here more disorder must be created. The conditioner of this statement suffices that living systems are open systems in which both heat, mass, and or work may transfer into or out of the system. Unlike temperature, the putative entropy of a living system would drastically change if the organism were thermodynamically isolated. If an organism was in this type of ‚Äúisolated‚Äù situation, its entropy would increase markedly as the once-living components of the organism decayed to an unrecognizable mass. Phase change Owing to these early developments, the typical example of entropy change ŒîS is that associated with phase change. In solids, for example, which are typically ordered on the molecular scale, usually have smaller entropy than liquids, and liquids have smaller entropy than gases and colder gases have smaller entropy than hotter gases. Moreover, according to the third law of thermodynamics, at absolute zero temperature, crystalline structures are approximated to have perfect \\"order\\" and zero entropy. This correlation occurs because the numbers of different microscopic quantum energy states available to an ordered system are usually much smaller than the number of states available to a system that appears to be disordered. From his famous 1896 Lectures on Gas Theory, Boltzmann diagrams the structure of a solid body, as shown above, by postulating that each molecule in the body has a \\"rest position\\". According to Boltzmann, if it approaches a neighbor molecule it is repelled by it, but if it moves farther away there is an attraction. This, of course was a revolutionary perspective in its time; many, during these years, did not believe in the existence of either atoms or molecules (see: history of the molecule). According to these early views, and others such as those developed by William Thomson, if energy in the form of heat is added to a solid, so to make it into a liquid or a gas, a common depiction is that the ordering of the atoms and molecules becomes more random and chaotic with an increase in temperature: center Thus, according to Boltzmann, owing to increases in thermal motion, whenever heat is added to a working substance, the rest position of molecules will be pushed apart, the body will expand, and this will create more molar-disordered distributions and arrangements of molecules. These disordered arrangements, subsequently, correlate, via probability arguments, to an increase in the measure of entropy. Entropy- driven order Entropy has been historically, e.g. by Clausius and Helmholtz, associated with disorder. However, in common speech, order is used to describe organization, structural regularity, or form, like that found in a crystal compared with a gas. This commonplace notion of order is described quantitatively by Landau theory. In Landau theory, the development of order in the everyday sense coincides with the change in the value of a mathematical quantity, a so-called order parameter. An example of an order parameter for crystallization is \\"bond orientational order\\" describing the development of preferred directions (the crystallographic axes) in space. For many systems, phases with more structural (e.g. crystalline) order exhibit less entropy than fluid phases under the same thermodynamic conditions. In these cases, labeling phases as ordered or disordered according to the relative amount of entropy (per the Clausius/Helmholtz notion of order/disorder) or via the existence of structural regularity (per the Landau notion of order/disorder) produces matching labels. However, there is a broad class of systems that manifest entropy-driven order, in which phases with organization or structural regularity, e.g. crystals, have higher entropy than structurally disordered (e.g. fluid) phases under the same thermodynamic conditions. In these systems phases that would be labeled as disordered by virtue of their higher entropy (in the sense of Clausius or Helmholtz) are ordered in both the everyday sense and in Landau theory. Under suitable thermodynamic conditions, entropy has been predicted or discovered to induce systems to form ordered liquid- crystals, crystals, and quasicrystals. In many systems, directional entropic forces drive this behavior. More recently, it has been shown it is possible to precisely engineer particles for target ordered structures. Adiabatic demagnetization In the quest for ultra-cold temperatures, a temperature lowering technique called adiabatic demagnetization is used, where atomic entropy considerations are utilized which can be described in order-disorder terms. In this process, a sample of solid such as chrome-alum salt, whose molecules are equivalent to tiny magnets, is inside an insulated enclosure cooled to a low temperature, typically 2 or 4 kelvins, with a strong magnetic field being applied to the container using a powerful external magnet, so that the tiny molecular magnets are aligned forming a well-ordered \\"initial\\" state at that low temperature. This magnetic alignment means that the magnetic energy of each molecule is minimal.NASA ‚Äì How does an Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator Work ? The external magnetic field is then reduced, a removal that is considered to be closely reversible. Following this reduction, the atomic magnets then assume random less-ordered orientations, owing to thermal agitations, in the \\"final\\" state: Entropy \\"order\\"/\\"disorder\\" considerations in the process of adiabatic demagnetization The \\"disorder\\" and hence the entropy associated with the change in the atomic alignments has clearly increased. In terms of energy flow, the movement from a magnetically aligned state requires energy from the thermal motion of the molecules, converting thermal energy into magnetic energy. Yet, according to the second law of thermodynamics, because no heat can enter or leave the container, due to its adiabatic insulation, the system should exhibit no change in entropy, i.e. ŒîS = 0. The increase in disorder, however, associated with the randomizing directions of the atomic magnets represents an entropy increase? To compensate for this, the disorder (entropy) associated with the temperature of the specimen must decrease by the same amount. The temperature thus falls as a result of this process of thermal energy being converted into magnetic energy. If the magnetic field is then increased, the temperature rises and the magnetic salt has to be cooled again using a cold material such as liquid helium.  Difficulties with the term \\"disorder\\"  In recent years the long- standing use of term \\"disorder\\" to discuss entropy has met with some criticism.Frank L. Lambert, 2002, \\"Disorder‚ÄîA Cracked Crutch for Supporting Entropy Discussions,\\" Journal of Chemical Education 79: 187. Updated version at here.Carson, E. M., and Watson, J. R., (Department of Educational and Professional Studies, Kings College, London), 2002, \\"Undergraduate students' understandings of entropy and Gibbs Free energy,\\" University Chemistry Education ‚Äì 2002 Papers, Royal Society of Chemistry.Sozbilir, Mustafa, PhD studies: Turkey, A Study of Undergraduates' Understandings of Key Chemical Ideas in Thermodynamics, Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Educational Studies, The University of York, 2001. Critics of the terminology state that entropy is not a measure of 'disorder' or 'chaos', but rather a measure of energy's diffusion or dispersal to more microstates.

Biography Upon his departure from Westminster, Jones-Parry received a great amount of attachment and approval from staff and pupils. He was depicted as \\"an excellent leader and educator, who devoted his time entirely for the sake of education rather than to building excessive relationship with external high-society figures, who bears a warm heart under a stern appearance, who will always be remembered for picking up rubbish from the Little Dean's Yard ground.\\" There was rumour that he was in argument with the school council over issues concerning the allocation of funds gathered from benefactors. The council thought the fund should be used for improving school facilities while he was of the opinion that the money should be provided to smart students unable to afford fees. He became involved in media and political controversy in 2004, when on retiring from independent schools at the age of 58, after 30 years' teaching experience, applied to teach in a state school in order to \\"give a bit back\\", but was rejected by the General Teaching Council on the basis that he had not completed the PGCE teacher training course which is obligatory for teachers in the state sector but not in the independent schools, insisting also that they were obliged to apply this rule rigidly.This man is head of the top private school in Britain. So why isn't he seen as good enough for the state sector?. The Daily Telegraph Critics of the decision labelled it ‚Äútotally absurd‚Äù, given Jones-Parry's long teaching experience in leading independent schools, and as Headmaster of Westminster - frequently cited as the most academically successful school in the country. The growing media controversy surrounding the issue, further spotlighted what many saw as a particularly onerous example of bureaucratic pedantry, leading to pressure on the then Education Secretary Charles Clarke from his own advisers to change the rules.State ban on private teachers 'must be scrapped' The Times Following a decision that the rules were necessary in order to preserve standards, the National Union of Teachers and NASUWT endorsed it, and the Teacher Training Agency stated that a fast-track route for qualified teachers already exists.Teachers back state ban on private teacher The GuardianThinktank raps courses that fail to teach teachers The GuardianTeaching unions get ready to defend the great divide The Times Jones- Parry is now head of the innovative independent Sixth Form at Hampton Court House School.

One is a member of the UNC cheerleading team in an anthropomorphic ram costume; the second is also an anthropomorphic ram costume, and the third is a live Dorset Horn sheep named Rameses who attends Carolina football games with his horns painted Carolina blue.  Origin  The origin of a ram as North Carolina's mascot dates back to 1924. In 1922, the star fullback, Jack Merritt, was given the nickname \\"the battering ram\\" for his performance on the field, as well as for an initiation ritual he created for male freshman students. Vic Huggins, North Carolina's head cheerleader at the time, suggested the idea of a ram mascot to the athletic business manager, Charles T. Woollen, and had the idea approved. Charles gave Vic $25 to purchase a ram. Rameses the First was shipped from Texas, just in time for the pep rally. The first appearance of Rameses was at a pep rally before the football game against Virginia Military Institute on November 8, 1924. After the pep rally the ram was taken to Emerson Field. Through three quarters the game was scoreless. Late in the fourth quarter Bunn Hackney was called out to attempt a field goal. Before stepping out on the field he rubbed Rameses' head. Just a few seconds later Hackney kicked a 30-yard field goal that eventually won the game for the Tar Heels; the final score was 3-0. Rameses has been a fixture on the sidelines at UNC football games ever since. The current Rameses ram is under the care of the Hogan family of Chapel Hill. The origin of the costumed version of Rameses dates back to the 1987-88 season. Auditions were held and a senior, Eric Chilton from Mount Airy, North Carolina, was given the honor to be the first mascot. Since auditions were held in the middle of the school year he only served for half a year and only showed up in a few basketball games in early 1988. The costume was made locally and looked different from the one used today. Rameses Jr. at a football game Rameses Jr. On the evening of October 26, 2015, Rameses Jr., or RJ for short, made his debut during Late Night with Roy, North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball's annual Midnight Madness event. Brown Walters, the director of spirit programs at UNC Chapel Hill, told The Daily Tar Heel it took a year to come up with the concept of RJ. RJ was conceived in part to expand the reach of UNC Chapel Hill's spirit program. RJ's design, featuring a less muscular body, Carolina blue horns, blue eyes and Jordan- brand apparel, was also developed to appeal to children. Walters said small children were frightened by the current version of the Rameses costume. Killing of Rameses XXIII In February 1996, Rameses XXIII was killed in his pasture at the Hogan farm. An attacker slashed the ram's throat and cut off its left front leg, stabbing it as many as 10 times along its chest and neck. State veterinarians stated that the slash to its throat was most likely the fatal wound. Police later charged 26-year-old Scott Wade. Wade stumbled onto the Hogan farm drunk at the time of the slaying. Investigators believed Wade killed the ram because he was hungry. Wade was later charged with misdemeanor animal cruelty.  Jason Ray  On March 23, 2007, Jason Ray, a member of the UNC Chapel Hill cheerleading squad, was struck by a vehicle near a Hilton Hotel on Route 4 in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The Tar Heel men's basketball team had advanced to the 2007 East Regional Semifinals, and the Fort Lee Hilton was the Tar Heel team hotel. Ray was walking to a convenience store to buy a burrito and a soda before he was due to portray Rameses in the game against the USC Trojans. Ray died on March 26, 2007 at the Hackensack University Medical Center as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident. Ray was an honors student and was due to graduate that May with a degree in business administration and a minor in religious studies. He was an Eagle Scout with Troop 38 in Concord, NC, had gone on three missionary trips (Haiti, Honduras, and Puerto Rico) to work with children, had visited the Sistine Chapel, ran with the bulls in Spain, and spent a summer studying in Copenhagen, Denmark. Ray was also an active member of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, his church choir, and was the lead singer in the band Nine PM Traffic. Four people received organ transplants because of Ray's decision to become an organ donor. On April 16, 2016, UNC Hospitals dedicated its transplant clinic to Ray. An endowment fund, also dedicated to Ray, was started to raise funds for patients unable to pay for their transplants. The Ray family pledged to raise one million dollars for this endowment fund. On September 21, 2017, it was announced Rameses and RJ would wear patches commemorating honoring Ray's memory for all sporting events held during the 2017-18 season, starting with the 2017 North Carolina Tar Heels football team's game against Duke.

It uses a unique algorithm based on three multi-faceted polyhedrons floating in RGB colorspace that are used to isolate color regions in the foreground image. Primatte is often referred to as a compositing technology and is usually used as a plug-in for host products such as Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk Media and Entertainment Inferno or Flame, Eyeon Fusion and several other compositing and editing software packages.  Workflow  Primatte is usually activated on a foreground image with a person or other foreground object filmed or digitized against a solid colored background or backing screen; usually a bluescreen or a greenscreen. The solid colored background area is removed and replaced with transparency. This allows the user to replace the solid colored background with a background image of his choice. If the foreground object was filmed close to the backing screen or with less than ideal lighting conditions, the foreground object will usually have ‚Äòspill‚Äô somewhere on it. This is most common when filming blonde people against a blue or greenscreen as their translucent hair will absorb the backing screen color. Such ‚Äòcolorspill‚Äô can be removed and replaced with several options to achieve a more realistic result. Another problem is chromakeying images that were created on film stock is that some film stocks have a distinct ‚Äòfilm grain‚Äô to them. A large amount of film grain will often cause rough edges around the foreground object. Rough edges can be minimized to achieve a smoother transition between the edges of the ‚Äòchroma keyed‚Äô foreground object and the user selected background image.  History  The Primatte algorithm was created by Yasushi Mishima while working at IMAGICA Corporation in Tokyo, Japan in 1992. The basic algorithm utilized in Primatte was originally presented at the 8th NICOGRAPH Conference and the 23rd Imaging Technology Conference and a U.S. patent was granted in 1994. It was initially released as a stand-alone product on Silicon Graphics workstations but it was later determined to be more useful as a ‚Äòplug-in‚Äô actuated from within a host application. This alleviated the need to save the images, exit the host compositing application, start Primatte, load the images, create the chroma key, save the images, start the host application, load the images and continue creating the composition. Since then it has been ported to almost every major compositing and editing software application on the market. The current version is the fourth generation of the Primatte technology and has features such as ‚ÄòAuto-Compute‚Äô that automatically detects the backing screen color, eliminates it and does clean-up on the foreground and backing screen area noise. It is available on the Microsoft Windows, Red Hat Linux, SGI IRIX and the Apple Macintosh platforms.  The Algorithm  The Primatte chromakey algorithm is a method of color space segmentation, where Primatte segments all the colors in the foreground image into one of four separate categories. The result is a 'spill suppressed' foreground image and a matte which is used to apply the modified foreground to a suitable background. Primatte works in 3D RGB color space. Here is a visual representation of the Primatte algorithm after an image has been processed. 3D Viewer Window The user essentially creates three concentric, multi-faceted polyhedrons. These can be pictured as three globes (or polyhedrons or polys), one within the other, which share a common center point. The creation of these polyhedrons separates all possible foreground colors into one of four regions; inside the small polyhedron (1), between the small and medium polyhedrons (2), between the medium and the large polyhedrons (3) and outside the large polyhedron (4).

His inventions were notable for their humour and almost complete lack of practical applicability. Personal life Very little is known about Pedrick. He worked for many years as a patent examiner at the United Kingdom Patent Office but that it was only after his retirement that he began filing patent applications for his inventions. The Patent Office has stringent restrictions on improbable gadgets, but Pedrick's familiarity with the process enabled him to satisfy the requirements and get his applications granted. During this period he was resident in Selsey, Sussex, England, according to his patents. Sometimes his residence would further be listed as \\"One-Man Photo-Electric Research Laboratories\\", or \\"One Man Think Tank Nuclear Fusion Research Laboratories\\", and so forth. These laboratories were staffed by himself and a ginger coloured cat, sometimes referred to as \\"Ginger\\" although it is not clear whether this was actually his name. Ginger was of great help to Pedrick in developing his inventions. Unfortunately, it is recounted in some of the patents how Ginger was unable to secure financing to put the inventions into practice. His patent for laser induced fusionInitiating A Controlled Fusion Reaction Using Deuterium And Tritium Pellets In Imploding Bullets Fed With Powerful Laser Beam Pulses includes these autobiographical notes: > It is my personal experience based on a severe bout of Dive bombing by Stuka > dive bombers in a light cruiser HMS \\"Dido\\", in 1941, evacuating mainly New > Zealanders from Crete, who had been sent in by the late Sir Winston > Churchill, but who, after the battle with the Nazi paratroops had made the > island untenable, Admiral Cunningham, the Naval C in C in Alexandria, > realised must be got out if possible, that the surface warships just cannot > survive attacks by large numbers of aircraft, on their own, and it is only > the chance of fate that I happened to be in After Engine Room of the ship, > when a bomb came down on B turret and created a carnage of twisted steel and > bodies forward, that I am writing this now, but the memory of the experience > still gives me a \\"nightmare\\" at times. > I have suffered all my life even from a by product of the 1914‚Äì18 war even > if I was born after it.

There are endless arguments about the subject of > abortion on the \\"rights of the foetus\\", and these could all be settled if, > in some way, the future could be predicted for the foetus and it could > decide whether it \\"wanted to be born\\". Inventions =Chromatically selective cat flap= Many of Pedrick's inventions related to his cat, Ginger. His crowning achievement in this respect was patent GB1426698 titled \\"Photon Push-Pull Radiation Detector For Use in Chromatically Selective Cat Flap Control And 1000 Megaton Earth-Orbital Peace-Keeping Bomb\\". The idea was to detect the difference in fur colour between a ginger cat and a black cat. He came up with this idea because a black cat named \\"Blackie\\" from next door kept trying to steal his own cat's food. However, with Pedrick's new catflap design, if Blackie attempted to use the cat-flap he would not be allowed in. Ginger was impressed with the idea, and further suggested that the concept could be applied as a nuclear deterrent. Ginger's concern over the Cold War and the nuclear arsenals threatening the world was a regular motivator for Pedrick's inventions. =Extinguishing fires in high rise block buildings= Pedrick was also concerned with the safety of his fellow man and thus described, in GB1453920 an \\"Apparatus For Extinguishing Fires in High Rise Block Buildings of Uniform Transverse Cross-Section Or Plan\\". Here, Pedrick suggests that fire curtains could be secured at the roof level of a high-rise building. When released, they would envelope substantially the entire building. The curtains could be provided with apertures which when the curtain is released are located opposite rooms in the building, these rooms being designated as ones in which the occupants should congregate in the event of fire. The concern however was that such large curtains would have prevented escape from the building as well as increase the risk of suffocation. =Transfer of fresh water = Pedrick's concern for his fellow man is again shown in GB1047735, titled \\"Arrangements for the transfer of fresh water from one location on the earth's surface to another at a different latitude, for the purpose of irrigation, with pumping energy derived from the effect of the earth's rotation about the polar axis\\". In this patent, Pedrick describes in extremely long detail, with pages of mathematical equations, how snow and ice could be passed along pipelines from the Antarctic to irrigate the dry Australian outback, creating a \\"granary of the East\\" that could feed the burgeoning population of the world. Since the flow of water from one region to the other through such pipelines would not be practicable, according to Pedrick, the suggestion is to instead compress the snow into hard balls that could be fired along these pipelines as projectiles. Notable quotations Pedrick would often discuss, within his patents, the problems in the world that led him to his inventions and would also recount conversations between himself and his ginger cat. Some of these tangents in his patents show Pedrick to be a thoughtful, if slightly eccentric man, who was deeply concerned with the well-being of others and for the future of mankind, as well as being dismissive of modern capitalism. Characteristic observations on the world around him include the following: *\\"Almost 2000 years ago, a strange character called Jesus Christ went about Palestine saying we should all love our enemies, but he was crucified before much notice was taken of him, and it is curious that the very land of Palestine is now one of the World \\"Trouble spots\\" in 1974.\\" *\\"It being the opinion of my Ginger Cat, that those cats that you see sponsoring various brands of tinned cat food on T/V are just as hypocritical as the various actors one sees sponsoring on T/V various commercial products, and in fact my Ginger Cat prefers ordinary Corned Beef to most brands of Cat food.\\" *\\"Unfortunately it is fact that thermo- nuclear weapons can be contained with the noses of Interncontinental- ballistic-rockets which results in the fact that distrust between governments of nations able to manufacture nuclear weapons, for example the USA and USSR, results in such nations keeping in readiness large numbers of such rockets to be used as a so called \\"deterrent\\" against an attack by such other nations. :\\"Clearly if one such nation, for example the USA, could be assured by some system, which would be quite automatic, that any other nation making a nuclear attack upon it, would be sure to bring upon itself a similar nuclear devastation, it could then allow a run-down of its own thermo-nuclear weapons stocks for the deuterium and tritium to be used for peaceful purposes to overcome the \\"energy shortage\\"\\" :\\"As Ginger pointed out to me the whole unfortunate situation might have been avoided if Albert Einstein had not \\"doodled out\\" his equation E = mc2, in the Swiss Patent Office around 1905 instead of getting on with the work he was being paid to do.\\"Earth Orbital Bombs As Nuclear Deterrents Response \\"Funny\\" patents, such as those published by Pedrick, and their popularisation in the media upset many patent examiners who feel they tend to trivialise the subject.CIPA Journal, January 2008, Volume 37, number 1, p. 32  Patents  A selection from over 160 patents filed between 1962 and 1975.

Playing career =Coventry City= Born in Coventry, West Midlands, Christie began his career as a trainee at Coventry City in 1995. He made his FA Premier League debut on 23 September 1995, appearing as a second-half substitute for Paul Cook in Coventry's 5‚Äì1 defeat away to Blackburn Rovers. He made one further appearance, in the League Cup before joining Bournemouth on loan in November 1996, followed by a loan spell with Mansfield Town from February 1997. =Mansfield Town= He joined Mansfield Town on a free transfer in August 1997 and made over 90 league and cup appearances for Mansfield in two seasons. He joined Leyton Orient for a fee of ¬£40,000 in July 1999, and made over 60 league and cup appearances for Orient in three seasons, before returning to Mansfield Town in August 2002. He made over 70 appearances in his second spell at Mansfield but was released by the club after defeat in the Third Division play-off Final in May 2004. In 1997, he scored a four-minute hat-trick against Stockport County in a League Cup first-round tie. This remains the record for the fastest League Cup hat-trick. =Kidderminster Harriers= Christie signed for Kidderminster Harriers at the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season, but injury restricted him to just one start and a handful of substitute appearances that season. =Rochdale= In January 2006, after having scored 10 goals in 23 league games, he was sold to Rochdale along with teammate Mark Jackson for a joint ¬£35,000 transfer fee. In August 2006, Christie returned to Kidderminster on loan until December. =Kidderminster Harriers= Following the completion of this loan spell Christie re-signed for Kidderminster on an 18-month contract in January 2007. =Stevenage Borough= He joined Stevenage Borough when his contract with Kidderminster expired at the end of June 2008. He made just three appearances for Stevenage, before joining fellow Conference National side Kettering Town on loan on 2 September 2008 until 17 January 2009. During this period he scored 6 goals in 15 games, including playing against Premier League side Fulham in the FA Cup. It was believed this loan spell was to be ended early for a loan move to York City to go ahead, but this deal fell through. =Torquay United= On 31 December 2008 it was announced that Christie was to make his loan deal at Kettering permanent on 1 January 2009, in a five-figure deal. However, on 2 February 2009 he left Stevenage to join Torquay United. =King's Lynn= He signed for non-League King's Lynn in August 2009 after a short period on trial with Hibernians in Malta, following termination of the loan agreement with Torquay at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. =A.F.C. Telford United= On 11 September 2009, Christie signed for Conference North side A.F.C. Telford United, but left after two games. =Farnborough= He played one game for his local team Coventry Sphinx, before making his debut for Farnborough as an 80th-minute substitute on 21 October. =Tamworth= On 13 November 2009, it was announced that Christie had joined Conference National side Tamworth on non-contract terms. On the same day he was joined by his former Kidderminster teammate Simon Brown, who joined the club on a one-month loan deal from Wrexham. =Kettering Town= After playing for Tamworth till the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, he rejoined Kettering Town for their 2010‚Äì11 campaign. =Nuneaton Town= On 30 March 2011, Christie joined promotion chasing Conference North side Nuneaton Town until the end of the season.

The Premier League and the English Football League are the only fully professional football leagues in England. The Premier League consists of 20 clubs at the top of the English football league system. The remaining 72 clubs are split into the three divisions of the English Football League: the Championship, League One and League Two. Some managers listed have had more than one spell in charge at their current club or had spells at more than one club, however this table deals only with their current appointment. This list includes every manager currently managing a club in the Premier League and the English Football League, in order of the date that they took up their appointment: this is not necessarily the date on which they were appointed, so there may be a discrepancy between the date appointed and the time as manager. Simon Weaver is currently the longest- serving manager, having managed Harrogate Town since May 2009, although eleven of those years were outside the Football League: Gareth Ainsworth, manager at Wycombe Wanderers since September 2012, has the longest current tenure as a manager in the league.

These specific budgetary earmarks account on average for approximately $600 per student according to 2004-2005 school year figures -- roughly eight percent of district operating budgets. Referendum J proposes a new requirement, that each school district spend a minimum of 65% of its operating budget on a set of budget items specified in the referendum. Budget items Referendum J would require that 65% of school district operating budgets be spent on the following budgetary items: * books and other instructional materials * classroom computers * field trips, athletics, arts, and music * libraries and librarians * principals * support services provided at the school level ** college placement services ** food services ** student health and medical services ** student testing ** teacher training ** transportation * support staff ** bus drivers ** food service workers ** guidance counselors ** nurses * teachers, classroom aides, and tutors Notably absent from the budgetary earmarks in Referendum J are: * superintendents and school boards * building construction, maintenance, and repairs * central administrative functions ** accounting ** budgeting ** payroll Corrective action Schools that fall short of budgetary requirements set forth in Referendum J would be required to increase budgetary earmarks for specified items by two percent per year until minimums are met. Provisions are made for districts to request a waiver for a period of one year. Referendum J allows voters to exempt specific districts from its budgetary requirements, and standardizes budget submission formats to the state to facilitate tracking of Referendum J compliance. Estimated fiscal impact The Colorado Department of Education's oversight of Referendum J requirements is expected to increase state costs by approximately $62,000 annually. School district costs may also be increased by requiring more detailed expenditure tracking, budget planning, and budget submission procedures introduced with Referendum J if it passes. Referendum J does not increase funding for public education. Differences with Amendment 39 Also on the 2006 ballot is Amendment 39, a proposed amendment to the state Constitution, which also proposes changes to school district budgetary requirements. Notably different is the fact that Amendment 39 does not require that any of the earmarked 65% of funding go to principals, support staff, or support services provided at the school level. The two ballot items also define a district's operating budget differently, which can affect various districts differently. Using the 2004-2005 school year as an example, the budget expenditures on items specified in Referendum J received 83% of district operating budgets on average, already well over the 65% that would be required by the new law, while according to Amendment 39's budget definitions only 60% of the budget was already spent in that year on the budget items specified by Amendment 39. Aside from the average, however, individual school budget analyses show that at least some schools in the state failed to meet the 65% requirements set forth by each of the ballot proposals. 166 school districts would have fallen short by a total of $278 million according to the requirements of Amendment 39, while three districts would have fallen short for a total of approximately one million dollars under the requirements of Referendum J, if they had both been in effect for the 2004-2005 school year.

He was the grandfather of the pioneering biochemist Ernst Schulze. Biography Schulze was a professor at Wittenberg, Helmstedt, and G√∂ttingen.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol. 7, New York: Macmillan, 1972. His most influential book was Aenesidemus (1792), a skeptical polemic against Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Karl Leonhard Reinhold's Philosophy of the Elements. In G√∂ttingen, he advised his student Arthur Schopenhauer to concentrate on the philosophies of Plato and Kant. This advice had a strong influence on Schopenhauer's philosophy. In the winter semester of 1810 and 1811, Schopenhauer studied both psychology and metaphysics under Schulze.Arthur Schopenhauer, Manuscript Remains, Vol. 2, Berg, 1988, . Schulze died in G√∂ttingen. Quotes *\\"As determined by the Critique of Pure Reason, the function of the principle of causality thus undercuts all philosophizing about the where or how of the origin of our cognitions. All assertions on the matter, and every conclusion drawn from them, become empty subtleties, for once we accept that determination of the principle as our rule of thought, we could never ask, \\"Does anything actually exist which is the ground and cause of our representations?\\". We can only ask, \\"How must the understanding join these representations together, in keeping with the pre-determined functions of its activity, in order to gather them as one experience?\\"Di Giovanni, George, and H.

The company had been expanding its interactive Internet business, operating online sites for its newspapers and portal sites like LasVegas.com, which is licensed to Greenspun Media Group. The company is also a partner in the California Newspapers Partnership with MediaNews and Gannett. The company also formed Northwest Arkansas Newspapers LLC in November 2009, a joint venture with WEHCO Media Inc., in Arkansas. On November 28, 2010, Stephens Media Iowa, LLC, a subsidiary of Stephens Media, acquired several newspapers, including the Ames Tribune, Boone News- Republican, Dallas County News, Nevada Journal, Ames About People & Advertiser, Tri-County Times, and Algona Upper Des Moines from Midlands Newspapers Inc., a subsidiary of the Omaha World-Herald Company. In August, 2011, the Algona Upper Des Moines was sold to Hallmark Media.http://www.algona.com/articles/2011/09/01/news/top_news/doc4e5e994a93af0920449983.txt In February 2015, Stephens Media was purchased by GateHouse Media for $102.8 million. In December 2015, GateHouse sold the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the Stephens group's largest paper, to casino magnate Sheldon Adelson for $140 million. History The company was called Donrey Media Group, which was founded by Arkansas media mogul Donald W. Reynolds and based in Fort Smith, Arkansas. After Reynolds died in 1993 at the age of 86, the company was sold to the Stephens family of Arkansas, known for their Little Rock investment banking business Stephens Inc. Some of Donrey's properties were sold off, and the company moved its headquarters to Las Vegas, Nevada, home of its largest newspaper, the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The company was renamed Stephens Media Group in 2002. In June 2006, the company became known as Stephens Media LLC. The company has no connection with Stephens Media Group, a radio broadcasting company in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Copyright infringements In 2010, Stephens Media contracted with the litigation firm Righthaven LLC, giving it the power to enforce the company's copyrights when online violators go beyond the bounds of fair use. More than 141 lawsuits have been filed in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas since mid-March. In a column published in the RJ shortly after the lawsuits began, publisher Sherman Frederick, said the primary goal with the partnership with Righthaven was to deter theft of the company's copyrighted materials. He said if the company was successful, he hoped Righthaven would find other media clients. In late August, WEHCO Media, which owns the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and the Chattanooga Times Free Press, signed on with the firm. MediaNews Group has also used Righthaven to file a copyright infringement suit. The aggressive enforcement of the Stephens Media copyrights by Righthaven was being closely watched by other publishers, as is the debate it has generated. Critics of the relatively new practice have coined it 'copyright trolling', and argue that the purpose of such enforcement is to make a profit. In the Poynter article, Stephens Media general counsel Mark Hinueber says the goal is to make sure the company's intellectual rights are protected. \\"We were seeing our entire work product in some stories just being right-clicked and cut and pasted into blogs, where people were selling Google ads around them and making money.\\" The Las Vegas Sun has been thoroughly documenting Righthaven's activities and the response. The Sun‚Äôs outside law firm, Lewis and Roca, is defending several of the Righthaven suits. Targets of the Righthaven lawsuits included bloggers, political forums, major political parties, and several of the newspaper's own sources including NORML, DailyPaul.com, Infowars, Free Republic, and others. On August 25, 2010, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) announced that they will make efforts to assist Righthaven LLC defendants to the best of their ability. Righthaven's lawsuits came under increasing judicial scrutiny, which led to Righthaven being found in June 2011 to lack standing to sue for alleged infringement of copyrighted material to which it holds only a limited license, as such a license does not confer the right to sue for infringement. Sanctions against Righthaven and its attorney, Steven A. Gibson, of Nevada law firm Dickinson Wright, are currently being contemplated by one judge. Righthaven later had its assets seized to pay judgments levied against it in lawsuits it filed against those whom it said infringed on the copyrights of clients. As a result, copyrights which had been \\"sold\\" by Stephens to Righthaven were \\"sold back\\" to Stephens for $80,000 to pay legal fees. Joint venture In September 2009, Stephens Media and WEHCO Media Inc., owner of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, announced plans to combine their newspaper operations in Northwest Arkansas and operate as a single company. The venture was approved in November 2009 by the U.S. Justice Department and a new Arkansas Limited Liability Company, Northwest Arkansas Newspapers LLC, was formed. Stephens Media sold its interest in the joint venture to WEHCO on May 5, 2016, which assumed control of all operations of the newspapers in the joint venture.

Yesler (December 2, 1810 ‚Äì December 16, 1892) was an entrepreneur and a politician, regarded as a founder of the city of Seattle. Yesler served two non-consecutive terms as Mayor of Seattle, and was the city's wealthiest resident during his lifetime. Biography Yesler arrived in Seattle from Ohio in 1852 and built a steam-powered sawmill, which provided numerous jobs for those early settlers and Duwamish tribe members. The mill was located right on the Elliott Bay waterfront, at the foot of what is now known as Yesler Way and was then known as Mill Road or the \\"Skid Road,\\" so named for the practice of \\"skidding\\" greased logs down the steep grade from the ever- receding timber line to the mill. In running the mill, Yesler built the city's first water system in 1854. The system was made up of a series of open-air, V-shaped flumes perched on stilts that started atop First Hill and ran down past Yesler's residence and to the mill. Later on, after complaints of dirty water, Yesler developed a system made up of log pipes and iron buried beneath the ground. Sarah B. Yesler In 1858, Yesler's wife Sarah joined him in Seattle, and the couple lived in a simple house across from the mill. Prior to her arrival, Yesler fathered a child named Julia with the fifteen-year-old Native daughter of a local Duwamish hereditary chief. Henry and Sarah Yesler in front of their home at 1st Avenue and James Street on July 4, 1883 Yesler also served in public office, at various times as a county auditor, county commissioner, and mayor. Yesler's post-fire Pioneer Building in 1900 On June 6, 1889, the Great Seattle Fire destroyed the entire business district (which consisted mainly of wooden buildings), including Yesler's sawmill, Yesler's Hall, a theater on the corner of and 1st Avenue, and Yesler's Pavilion, a civic center on 1st and Cherry Street. They were never replaced. In 1892, Yesler erected the Pioneer Building on the same plot of land where his first home stood, now the heart of Seattle's Pioneer Square. Sarah Yesler had died in 1887, but Yesler built a large new mansion and shared his mansion with a younger female relative (some sources describe her as a maid), whom he married five months later. The Yesler mansion in 1900. It burned January 2, 1901 when it housed the Seattle Public Library Yesler died on December 16, 1892, at the age of 82. He is buried in Seattle's Lake View Cemetery. After his death, Yesler's mansion became the first home of the Seattle Public Library, and burned down on January 2, 1901. The King County Courthouse currently occupies the site.  Personality  In his informative and tongue-in-cheek book, Sons of the Profits, columnist and Seattle historian William C. Speidel pointed out some of Yesler's negative aspects. On numerous occasions, Yesler had lawsuits filed against him. On other occasions, it was Yesler himself doing the suing. \\"The City of Seattle made him a millionaire,\\" wrote Speidel, \\"yet he sued it...fought it...plundered it...and on two occasions he brought it to the brink of bankruptcy.\\" Speidel also recounts how, according to courthouse records, Yesler owed John McLain, an old friend from Ohio, $30,000 for the loan that the latter set up for construction of the mill. Yesler would pay him $12,000 of it over time, and it wasn't until McLain sued him that he was able to collect on the rest. Two images of Yesler's Mill and nearby buildings, 1874 Yesler and his wife Sarah were Spiritualists and believed in free love.Kathie M.

Its mandate was scheduled to begin on 1 January 2007 for an initial 12 months, and its creation and mission was as a result of recommendations in a report by the Secretary-General. The previous UN mission in Burundi, ONUB, was created to facilitate the implementation of the peace agreements signed between the previous government and the CNDD-FDD rebel group. The CNDD-FDD's leader Pierre Nkurunziza went on to win the Burundian elections in 2005, and his party effectively controls the Burundian government. The reasons for establishing a second mission in Burundi, following directly on the ONUB missions, was the ceasefire agreement reached between the new CNDD-FDD government and the last remaining rebel group Palipehutu-FNL. This ceasefire agreement was signed on 7 September 2006 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, after mediation by South Africa in talks that began in May. Among the key points in the agreement were a complete cessation of hostilities, temporary immunity for FNL fighters and the demobilization of these troops and their subsequent integration into the armed forces of Burundi, in line with earlier peace agreements in this conflict that all stipulated power-sharing arrangements in the security sector. The BINUB mission was created to facilitate the implementation of this ceasefire agreement, with the most important point of the mandate being the support of the implementation of the modalities of the agreement, assistance in the reform of the security sector and support of the reintegration of ex- combatants. The Burundian government also requested the BINUB to help in the establishment of rule of law, good governance and freedom of press and media. The mandate of BINUB currently extends to the end of 2010.

The dunes, which stand in the shadow of the impressive Bamburgh Castle, have been a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) since 1995 and are part of the North Northumberland Dunes Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The dunes have a rich diversity of flora and fauna and in places provide good examples of ‚Äúclimbing dunes‚Äù found where sand has been blown onto high ground adjacent to the beach. Bamburgh Dunes vary from open sandy beaches, through low ridges dominated by marram grass, to more stable grass-covered dunes. These occur as a series of irregular parallel sand ridges and hummocks separated by hollows, which are seasonally wet. Some of the plant species include the pyramidal orchid, Centaurium, sea sandwort and petalwort (which is on the List of endangered species in the British Isles) . The dunes are also rich in rare insect life, over 500 species have been identified including 15 rare species including a plant hopper (Dicranotropis divergens) a grass-mining fly (Opomyza punctata), and a shore fly (Psilopa marginella). Birds attracted to the dunes include grasshopper warbler, sedge warbler, European stonechat, meadow pipit and reed bunting. In winter short-eared owl and water rail are also found. Over the years more vigorous invasive plant species and scrub have encroached, making the dune system too stabilised and threatening the uniqueness of Bamburgh Dunes, most rare plant species appreciate the unstable and shifting structure of sand dunes. In an effort to counteract this, Bamburgh Castle Estate, English Nature, DEFRA, Northumberland County Council and Bamburgh Parish Council have come up with a plan of management which has resulted in cattle being allowed to graze the dunes since 2000 to break up the dominant grass cover. A fence has been erected to contain the cattle within the dunes, access by people is encouraged within the fenced area with stiles and gates sited on the main paths. Bamburgh Dunes seen from the beach. An ancient Anglo- Saxon 7th century burial ground was unearthed in the dunes to the south east of Bamburgh Castle during an archaeological dig in 1998 by the Bamburgh Research Project. The burial ground, called the Bowl Hole, had been known to exist since 1816 when violent storms removed large amounts of dune sand and uncovered the site for a period. The BBC television programme ‚ÄúMeet the Ancestors‚Äù became involved during the dig and screened a programme about the finds in February 2001.

The loop-switch sequence is a specific derivative of spaghetti code. It is not necessarily an antipattern to use a switch statement within a loop‚Äîit is only considered incorrect when used to model a known sequence of steps. The most common example of the correct use of a switch within a loop is an inversion of control such as an event handler. In event handler loops, the sequence of events is not known at compile-time, so the repeated switch is both necessary and correct (see event-driven programming, event loop and event-driven finite state machine). This is not a performance antipattern, though it may lead to an inconsequential performance penalty due to the lack of an unrolled loop. Rather, it is a clarity antipattern, as in any non- trivial example it is much more difficult to decipher the intent and actual function of the code than the more straightforward refactored solution. Example An event-driven solution would implement a listener interface: String key = null; String value = null; List params = null; int column = 0; public void addToken(token) { // parse a key, a value, then three parameters switch (column) { case 0: params = new LinkedList(); key = token; break; case 1: value = token; break; default: params.add(token); break; } if (++column >= 5) { column = 0; completeRow(key, value, params); } } But without the listener, it becomes an example of the antipattern: // parse a key, a value, then three parameters String key = null; String value = null; List params = new LinkedList(); for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { switch (i) { case 0: key = stream.parse(); break; case 1: value = stream.parse(); break; default: params.add(stream.parse()); break; } } And here is the refactored solution: // parse a key and value String key = stream.parse(); String value = stream.parse(); // parse 3 parameters List params = new LinkedList(); for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) { params.add(stream.parse()); } References Category:Anti-patterns ","title":"Loop-switch sequence"},{"id":"7728653","text":"Nature's Valley is a holiday resort and small village on the Garden Route along the southern Cape coast of South Africa. Nature's Valley lies between the Salt River, the foothills of the Tsitsikamma Mountains, the Indian Ocean and the Groot River lagoon. Nature's Valley has a balmy climate and is surrounded by the de Vasselot Nature Reserve which is part of the Tsitsikamma Park, and in turn part of the Garden Route National Park. 800px History Nature's Valley, and the surrounding coastline, was occupied by Old Stone Age or Paleolithic man from 1 million years ago. Paleolithic man lived in the area in caves and under overhangs, collecting food in the tidal zone and hunting for a rich variety of wildlife. Various glacial periods interrupted this coastal occupation. San hunter-gatherers lived in this area from about 10,000 years ago until they were displaced by Khoikhoi herders from the interior. =The Groot River pass= View of the Groot River For a long time travel along the Garden Route parallel to the coastline was impossible, due to the extremely deep and precipitous river gorges blocking all east-west traffic. Charles Collier Michell reported in 1839: \\"there is no practical way ‚Äì not even a footpath, from Plettenberg Bay to the Tzitzikamma country\\". Thomas Bain built a road from George to Knysna, the so-called \\"Seven Passes Road\\", which took from 1867 to 1883 to complete. Previously, access to the coastal area which lay further east was possible only via the Langkloof valley, which lies immediately north of the Tsitsikamma Mountains. Nature's Valley only became easily accessible after Thomas Bain completed the Grootrivier Pass in 1880. He and Captain Christopher Harison (later Conservator of Forests) first explored the route in 1868 to test its feasibility. Harison's interest in the road stemmed from his belief that it could be used to halt the runaway destruction of the forest started by Dutch East India Company woodcutters in 1777 and carried on by their descendants. At the time that Bain and Harison reconnoitred the route, Bain was supervising the construction of no fewer than six passes, so that 10 years would elapse before he could start work on the Groot River Pass. A hundred years later the demands of road transport would dictate the building of a freeway with enormous concrete bridges ‚Äì a tribute to the skill of engineers, and bringing in its wake considerable collateral damage to the environment. =Permanent settlement= A Scene in Sitsikamma, fanciful 1801 painting by Samuel Daniell showing Asian elephants in the Tsitsikamma Forest After Bain's completion of the Groot River Pass, the Forestry Department proclaimed three lots in the Valley ‚Äì one for its own use and the other two sold to private individuals. The first person to settle in the now accessible valley, and who acquired a 69-hectare lot from Telfer Anderson, was Hendrik Jacobus Hermanus Barnardo who had been a foreman at Bain's Groot River construction camp. Barnardo was an enigmatic character who went to extreme lengths to protect the trees of the area, but enthusiastically led the slaughter of wildlife throughout the region. Barnardo married three times and fathered 19 children. Another member of his family shot the last Tsitsikamma elephant in 1881. In the face of continued pressure to sell a portion of his farm, Barnardo finally relented in 1941 and sold an area of 1.6963 morgen to a syndicate of ten buyers for the sum of ¬£755. In 1943 Baron Ulrich Behr of Kurland bought the option to purchase the remainder of Barnardo's property from the Van Reenen family, who had acquired the option in the 1920s, but had never exercised it. Behr then went through all the steps necessary to have the land proclaimed for development. In 1953 the township was declared and formally named \\"Nature's Valley\\" by Behr, a name that had been used by the syndicate at the suggestion of Wide du Preez of \\"The Crags\\". The Valley and surrounding area Groot River lagoon and Nature's Valley A network of trails covers the surrounding hills and beaches. The lagoon offers sheltered water for sailing and canoeing, without powerboating and beach buggies. A walk along beaches and a rocky path leads to the Salt River Mouth after crossing Pebble Beach, a large area completely covered in sea-smoothed cobbles. East of Nature's Valley is the Groot River Lagoon, which marks the end of the Otter Trail, starting at Storms River Mouth, 60 km further east. This 5-day trail is considered by many hikers to be the finest in South Africa, being strenuous, scenic and extremely varied. The route meanders along the coast through evergreen forest, past boulder-strewn beaches and frequently crossing tannin-stained streams. Huts are available for the hiker at the end of each day, but bookings have to be made well in advance. The Brenton blue butterfly, Orachrysops niobe, was first described from Knysna by Roland Trimen in 1858, and was not seen again until discovered in 1977 at Nature's Valley and shortly thereafter in 1979 at Brenton-on-Sea. The Nature's Valley population was assumed to be extinct when no more sightings were made after 1984. The cause of this decline was felt to be the absence of fynbos fires causing a shortage of the butterfly's foodplant Indigofera erecta, and accordingly a controlled burn was carried out in April 2003, with a reintroduction of butterfly eggs in August 2005. In 2000 researchers from the Albany Museum in Grahamstown discovered a number of aquatic insect species new to science in the Salt River, which lies at the western end of Nature's Valley. The isolated position of the river, a lack of fish and its acidic and unpolluted water are thought to have been factors in ensuring the undisturbed survival of these primitive forms. New housing developments within the catchment area of the Salt River may threaten the continued existence of these unique insects.

It operates under the authority of the European Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen.  Background  Directorate General Development and Cooperation - EuropeAid was formed on 1 January 2011 following the merger of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office (AIDCO) with the Directorate General for Development and Relations with ACP States (DEV). AIDCO had been founded on 1 January 2001 with the mission of implementing the EU external aid programmes around the world.http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/delivering-aid/funding- instruments/index_en.htm At that time, DG DEV and the Directorate General for External Relations (RELEX) were responsible for policy and programming. Following the creation of EuropeAid in 2011, Director-General Fokion Fotiadishttp://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/who/whoswho/director_general_en.htm was responsible for the overall realisation of the DG's mission, which consists in the programming and implementation of the European Commission's external aid instruments financed by the European Union budget and the European Development Funds. In November 2013, Fernando Frutuoso de Melo succeeded Fokion Fotiadis as Director-General of the Directorate General. EuropeAid focused on maximising the value and impact of aid funding by making sure support provided in a manner which complies with EU development objectives and the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals in a speedy and accountable fashion.http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/delivering-aid/ensuring- quality/index_en.htm Effective implementation and delivery of aid also helps the Commission and the EU as a whole to attain a higher profile on the world stage. The European Union is the world's largest development aid donor. DG Development and Cooperation - EuropeAid was reformed into current form on 1 January 2015. Development policy DG International Cooperation and Development formulates the European Union's development policy abroad. Its mission is to help reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty in developing countries through the promotion of sustainable development, democracy, peace and security.http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development- policies/index_en.htm It works on policy formulation at a global and sectoral level. The main intervention areas covered are: Trade and regional integration, Environment and the sustainable management of natural resources, Infrastructure, communications and transport, Water and energy, Rural development, Governance, democracy and human rights, Peace and security, Human development, Social cohesion and employment.http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development- policies/intervention-areas/index_en.htm EU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development, which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States, the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development-policies/european- consensus/index_en.htm  From policy to action  When implementing projects, it takes account of EU policy strategies and long-term programmes for the delivery of aid. It translates policies into practical actions and develops new ways of delivering aid, such as budget supporthttp://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/delivering-aid/budget- support/index_en.htm and through sectoral approaches.http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/delivering-aid/sector- approach/index_en.htm It also issues guidelines and makes evaluationshttp://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/ensuring-quality/index_en.htm of aid implementation. In addition, it is responsible for the proper management of funds and must use clear and transparent tendering and contracting procedures. The programming cycle and responsibilities have evolved with the creation of the European External Action Service EEAS.van Seters, J. and H. Klavert. 2011.

Reprogramming EU development cooperation for 2014-2020 - Key moments for partner countries, EU Delegations, member states and headquarters in 2012. (ECDPM Discussion Paper 129) Directorate-General is responsible for all the steps of an aid delivery project:http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/index_en.htm after identifying needs, it carries out feasibility studies and prepares all the necessary financial decisions and controls. It then moves on to drawing up the required tendering, monitoring and evaluation procedures. EuropeAid often publishes these evaluations in its website, aiming to improve management, in particular by taking into account the lessons of past public actions and to reinforce capacity to account for, and to ensure, better transparency. This institution is a decentralised organisation. Two out of three Commission staff members working on aid implementation are based in the field. That is why most of the preparatory and implementation work is done through the EU Delegations in the beneficiary countries. Directorate-General is made up of more than 43 units divided into nine directorates http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/who/documents/organigramme-devco_en.pdf attached to the Director General.  Promoting joint effort  To ensure coherence, complementarity and coordination in implementing external assistance programmes worldwide, DG DEVCO works in close collaboration with its various partners.http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/who/partners/index_en.htm The overall aim is to make external aid more effective.http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/delivering-aid/aid- effectiveness/index_en.htm Civil society, international organisations and governments of member states of the European Union are all important actors in this field.  Funding  Directorate-General awards grants and contracts to implement projects or activities that relate to the European Union's external aid programmes. To ensure that EuropeAid's work to improve people's lives is recognised, a set of visibility guidelineshttp://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/work/visibility/index_en.htm have been produced. These guidelines ensure that aid projects acknowledge the funding support they receive from Commission budgets. They also help to raise the general profile of the EU across the world. Development aid is financed directly by the EU budget (70%) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (EDF) (30%).Mikaela Gavas 2010. Financing European development cooperation: the Financial Perspectives 2014-2020. London: Overseas Development Institute The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' and 'thematic' instruments. The 'geographic' instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, ‚Ç¨16.9 billion, 2007‚Äì2013), which must spend 95% of its budget on official development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes.

Funding is provided by voluntary donations by EU member states. The EDF is subject to its own financial rules and procedures, and is managed by the European Commission (EC) and the European Investment Bank. Articles 131 and 136 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome provided for its creation with a view to granting technical and financial assistance to African countries that were still colonised at that time and with which certain countries had historical links. Usually lasting 6 years, each EDF lays out EU assistance to both individual countries and regions as a whole. The EU is on its 10th EDF from 2008-2013 with a budget of ‚Ç¨22.7 billion.Mikaela Gavas 2010. Financing European development cooperation: the Financial Perspectives 2014-2020. London: Overseas Development Institute This represents about 30% of EU spending on development cooperation aid, with the remainder coming directly from the EU budget. The budget of the 10th EDF can be broken down as follows: * ‚Ç¨21 966 million to the ACP countries (97% of the total), # ‚Ç¨17 766 million to the national and regional indicative programmes (81% of the ACP total), # ‚Ç¨2 700 million to intra-ACP and intra-regional cooperation (12% of the ACP total), # ‚Ç¨1 500 million to Investment Facilities (7% of the ACP total). * ‚Ç¨286 million to the OCTs (1% of the total), * ‚Ç¨430 million to the Commission as support expenditure for programming and implementation of the EDF (2% of the total). Negotiations for the 11th EDF would cover the period 2014-2020. This one-year extension compared to the 10th EDF allowed the end of the 11th EDF to coincide with the expiration of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement in 2020 and the EU budget period.Kilnes, U., N. Keijzer, J. van Seters and A. Sherriff More or less? A financial analysis of the proposed 11th European Development Fund (ECDPM Briefing Note 29). Maastricht: European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) The EDF has to date been funded outside the EU budget by the EU Member States on the basis of financial payments related to specific contribution shares, or ‚Äúkeys‚Äù. The Member State contributions keys are subject to negotiation. The EDF is the only EU policy instrument that is financed through a specific key that is different from the EU budget key, and which reflects the comparative interests of individual Member States. There was a debate on whether to 'budgetise' the EDF. However, in the Communication ‚ÄòA budget for Europe 2020‚Äô, the European Commission underlined that it was not appropriate at present time to propose that the EDF be integrated into the EU budget. The perceived advantages include: * contributions would be based on GNI and this may increase the voluntary contributions * the harmonisation of EU budget and EDF administration might decrease administration costs and increase effectiveness of the aid * 20% of aid to the ACP countries already originates from the EU budget * an all-ACP geographic strategy is no longer relevant as programmes are more localised to regions or country-level * there would be increase democratic control and parliamentary scrutiny The perceived disadvantages are that: * 90% of EDF resources reach low-income countries as opposed to less than 40% of aid from the EU budget development instruments * a loss of aid predictability and aid quality as the EU budget is annual, unlike the 6-year budget of the EDF In 2005, the EU and its Member States agreed to achieve a collective level of ODA of 0.7% of GNI by 2015 and an interim target of 0.56% by 2010, with differentiated intermediate targets for those EU Member States which had recently joined the Union. On the 23rd of May 2011, EU ministers responsible for development cooperation gathered to take stock of progress made and concluded that additional efforts would be needed to close an estimated gap of ‚Ç¨50 billion to reach the self-imposed collective EU target of 0.7% by 2015. By 2015, the EU had not reached 0.7% of GNI, though the commitment to this target was recently reaffirmed. The commitment held no deadline. Concord, the European confederation for relief and development, described the pledge as ‚Äúvague and non-binding‚Äù and said 2020 should be the new deadline. The EU's 'Agenda for Change' The European Commission's development strategy ‚Äì Agenda for Change ‚Äì puts ‚Äòinclusive and sustainable growth for human development‚Äô at its centre. Adopted in 2011, it adopted 2 reforms designed to make its development policy both more strategic and more targeted. The Agenda for Change made new policies and rules for budget support. The three main elements of this Agenda were: (1) Targeting and concentrating aid (2) Budget support (or 'State Building Contracts in fragile states) (3) Other reforms for effectiveness - joint programming, common results framework, innovative financing (such as blending loans and grants), and Policy Coherence for Development Programming the 11th European Development Fund The EU is currently implementing its 11th European Development Fund for the period 2014-2020, with an aid budget of ‚Ç¨30.5 billion for many of the ACP countries and Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs), covering both national and regional programmes. Effectively programming the European Development Fund (EDF) is a major political, policy and bureaucratic challenge, involving multiple stakeholders, namely the European Commission (EC), the European External Action Service (EEAS), 28 EU member states, the European Parliament, 74 governments from the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states and domestic accountability actors. Understanding the magnitude of the 11th EDF programming challenge is critical for three reasons: (1) The 11th EDF unfolds in a radically changed global context for development cooperation, as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were agreed in September 2015. (2) The 11th EDF is the last before the Cotonou Partnership Agreement (CPA) between the EU and the countries of the ACP expires in 2020. (3) Programming and implementing the 11th EDF is a critical test of EU institutions that deal with external action, and it tests the ability of EU development policy to achieve high-impact aid, at a time when showing 'value for money' is a high political priority at a time when many European governments follow a policy of fiscal austerity. Independent research by the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM), a think tank based in Maastricht (The Netherlands), shows that the EU has ensured the effective translation into practice of two key policy commitments of the 'Agenda for Change' - namely a more focused strategy for less developed countries (LDCs) and low-income countries (LICs), and the concentration of EU aid on a limited number of sectors and policy priorities. Their research found that the high degree of compliance was achieved \\"through top-level support and tight control from headquarters\\". While the principles of the 'Agenda for Change' appear to have been followed, ECDPM showed that in many countries initial programming proposals based on in-country consultations, managed by EU Delegations, were then superseded by the choices of EU headquarters in Brussels. Although the 11th EDF is closely aligned with national development plans, there is evidence that this top-down approach to programming has led to a significant erosion of key aid and development effectiveness principles, in particular country ownership. Critics The European Development Fund has been criticized because they can not prove what was purchased with the tsunami relief money.

Born in Aberdeen, he was the son of James Morrison. He originally worked as a schoolmaster in the Middlesex suburbs of North London. He became involved in the Labour and Co-Operative movements, and in 1914 was elected to Wood Green Urban District Council. In the same year war broke out, and he served as a private in the British Army from 1915 to 1919. In 1919 he returned to local politics when he was elected to Middlesex County Council. At the 1922 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tottenham North. He lost his seat at the 1931 general election to the Conservative Edward Doran, but was re-elected at the 1935 general election. After the 1924 general election, he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Leader of the Opposition Ramsay MacDonald,Rosen, Greg Serving the people: Co-operative Party history from Fred Perry to Gordon Brown, London: The Co-operative Party, 2007, p. 7 continuing to serve as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister after MacDonald's elevation to the Premiership. On 15 November 1945, shortly after he had been re-elected at the 1945 general election, he was ennobled as Baron Morrison, of Tottenham in the County of Middlesex. In 1946, Morrison was appointed as a member of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry seeking a policy to resolve the increasing conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine.

Background New York Eye and Ear Control came about when artist, musician, and filmmaker Michael Snow received a commission from a Toronto-based organization called Ten Centuries Concerts for a film employing jazz. Snow had recently attended and enjoyed a concert by saxophonist Albert Ayler (he recalled \\"I was completely knocked out\\"), and had been making his studio on Chambers Street in lower Manhattan available to musicians such as Roswell Rudd, Archie Shepp, Paul Bley, and Milford Graves for rehearsals. He decided to hire Ayler and his quartet (which at the time included trumpeter Don Cherry, bassist Gary Peacock, and drummer Sunny Murray, and which had recently recorded the albums Prophecy and (without Cherry) Spiritual Unity), along with trombonist Rudd and saxophonist John Tchicai, to make a recording, stating that he \\"wanted to buy a half an hour of music.\\" Snow recalled that he had certain stipulations going into the session: \\"I didn't want any previously played compositions, and I wanted it to be as much ensemble improvisations as could be with no solos.\\" He also stated: \\"As I was being involved with so-called free jazz, I was always surprised at how everybody was still bookending, as in all of previous jazz where you play a tune, play your variations, then play the tune again. I kept feeling that I didn't want that, and particularly what I had in mind for the film, I definitely didn't want it. I wanted it as pure free improvisation as I could get.\\" According to Snow, \\"They accepted and they performed this way... in my opinion, this is one reason for which the music is so great.\\" He later called the ensemble \\"one of the greatest jazz groups ever.\\" (In his 1966 essay \\"Around about New York Eye and Ear Control,\\" Snow summarized his thoughts regarding the music: \\"Song form finally unusable, strict rhythm finally unusable in 'Jazz.' It goes 'ahead' where it has to... Surprise! Demand for Song and Dance so natural there can be 'new' Songs, 'new' Rhythm, 'new' Dances. A very pleasant surprise.\\") The recording session took place on July 17, 1964 at the loft of poet Paul Haines, who was Snow's neighbor and who also set up and operated the recording equipment. Roswell Rudd recalled that Snow \\"didn't say anything. He said just go ahead and play and when he got the time he needed, he took that and made a movie with it. In other words made the movie from an improvised jam session rather than make the movie and fit the soundtrack to it. He made a soundtrack and then went out and shot a movie. I don't know how many people have ever done that.\\" (The album liner notes confirm this, stating \\"The music was recorded prior to the production of the film.\\") Snow's film uses the motif of what he called the \\"Walking Woman,\\" a silhouette based on the image of Carla Bley. Snow stated: \\"In my films I've tried to give the sound a more pure and equal position in relation to the picture.\\" \\"I was hoping for an uninterrupted stream of energy against which I was going to place the almost completely static shots of the two-dimensional Walking Woman figure, either negative or positive. The picture was edited with no reference to what sound episode might accompany it. It is an attempt to make a simultaneity of 'eye' with 'ear.' And the music was created to be a movie sound track, not to just be 'music.'\\" Regarding his choice of a title, Snow also said: > It's like the music is a particular kind of experience, and the film is > something quite different that you see simultaneously. That's why the title, > New York Eye and Ear Control: it was actually being able to hear the music > and being able to see the picture without the music saying, This image is > sad, or this image is happy ‚Äî which is a way that movie music is always > used. I really wanted it to be possible that you could hear them. So, > they're very, very different. It's as if the image part of it is very > classical and static. In fact, most of the motion is in the music actually. > So, they're kind of counterpointing and being in their own worlds, but > happening simultaneously. The film was premiered later that year in Toronto. Snow recalled: \\"I was surprised to see people getting up and leaving very early in the projection of the film.\\" At a later showing in New York, \\"The audience catcalled, booed, whistled, and threw paper at the screen. The film ended, and surprisingly, there was also some strong applause. Two people in the audience jumped up and ran to the booth where I was standing with the projectionist. They were very excited and said, 'That was wonderful. Who did that?' I said that I was the maker of the film, and we had a short conversation, and they introduced themselves: Andy Warhol and Gerard Malanga.\\" According to Snow, Bernard Stollman, founder of ESP-Disk, heard about the film and approached him about releasing the music on an album. Snow stated: \\"the idea came up after the film had been made and been shown and puzzled everyone... [Stollman] asked me whether I'd be interested, and actually I had very mixed feelings about it, because it was precisely made to be used in conjunction with the images that I made. I was making a film with this music, and to separate the two, I really had to argue myself into it. Which seems a bit strange, I suppose, but the intention was to use it in a certain way with certain kinds of images.\\" Reception Critics have compared the album with key free jazz recordings such as Ornette Coleman's earlier Free Jazz and John Coltrane's subsequent Ascension. John Litweiler regards it favourably in comparison because of its \\"free motion of tempo (often slow, usually fast); of ensemble density (players enter and depart at will); of linear movement\\". Ekkehard Jost places it in the same company and comments on \\"extraordinarily intensive give-and-take by the musicians\\" and \\"a breadth of variation and differentiation on all musical levels,\\" calling it \\"one of Ayler's very best recordings.\\" Richard Brody wrote that the album is \\"superior to those performances in its freer, truly group- oriented format, with no specified soloists and accompanists,\\" stating that \\"the riotous revelry joins the joy of New Orleans traditions to the urbane furies of the day.\\" All About Jazz reviewer Clifford Allen described New York Eye and Ear Control as \\"a valuable window into the music's early history as well as what might have happened outside record dates, more than one is usually privy to.\\" Playwright and director Richard Foreman described his reaction to the conjunction of the film and the music as follows: \\"Mike Snow postulates an eye that stares at surfaces with such intensity... the image itself seems to quiver, finally gives way under the pressure. A deceptive beginning-silent: a flat white form sharply cut to the silhouette of a walking woman, for no apparent reason propped against trees, rocks seashore. But slowly-under attack by time, light and an incredible growing music so aggressive it begins to bypass the ear and attack the eyes habits of seeing. Each time a cut wipes away this absurd idiogram-woman, she reappears ‚Äì supported against the threat of the destructive eye by the S-O-U-N-D! ‚Äì that insists on building a space in which objects can sustain themselves.\\" Track listing # \\"Don's Dawn\\" (Cherry/Peacock) ‚Äì 0:57 # \\"AY\\" (Ayler) ‚Äì 20:17 # \\"ITT\\" (Ayler) ‚Äì 22:05 Personnel *Albert Ayler - tenor saxophone *Don Cherry - trumpet *John Tchicai - alto saxophone *Roswell Rudd - trombone *Gary Peacock - bass *Sunny Murray - drums References Category:Albert Ayler albums Category:ESP-Disk albums Category:Free jazz albums Category:1965 albums Category:1965 soundtrack albums ","title":"New York Eye and Ear Control"},{"id":"7728939","text":"Sketches of Track Rock by James Mooney.

The Felixstowe hull had superior water contacting attributes and became a key base technology in most seaplane designs thereafter. Design and development Before the war Porte had worked with American aircraft designer Glenn Curtiss on a flying boat, America in which they intended to cross the Atlantic in order to win the ¬£10,000 prize offered by the British Daily Mail newspaper for the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic. Following the outbreak of war in Europe, Porte returned to England and rejoined the Royal Navy, eventually becoming commander of the naval air station at Felixstowe where he recommended the purchase from Curtiss of an improved version of the America flying boat on which he had worked, the Curtiss H-4 type,Bruce Flight 2 December 1955, pp. 843‚Äì844. resulting in the RNAS receiving two prototype Americas and 62 H-4s.Thetford 1978, p.78. The Curtiss H-4 was found to have a number of problems, being both underpowered and having a hull too weak for sustained operations and having poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off.Bruce Flight 2 December 1955, p.844.London 2003, pp. 16‚Äì17. One flying boat pilot, Major Theodore Douglas Hallam, wrote that they were \\"comic machines, weighing well under two tons; with two comic engines giving, when they functioned, 180 horsepower; and comic control, being nose heavy with engines on and tail heavy in a glide.\\"Hallam 1919, pp. 21‚Äì22. To try to resolve the H-4's hydrodynamic issues, in 1915 Porte carried out a series of experiments on four H-4s fitted with a variety of modified hulls, using the results of these tests to design a new hull which was fitted to the wings and tail of an H-4, serial number 3580, with a pair of 150 hp (112 kW) Hispano- Suiza 8 engines as the Felixstowe F.1.London 2003, p.18. Rather than the lightweight boat-type structure of the Curtiss boats, the F.1's hull was based around a sturdy wooden box-girder similar to that used in contemporary landplanes, to which were attached a single-step planing bottom and side sponsons. Once modified by the fitting of a further two steps, the new hull proved to give much better take off and landing characteristics and was much more seaworthy.Bruce Flight 2 December 1955, pp. 845‚Äì846.Thetford 1978, p. 191. Porte then designed a similar hull, for the larger Curtiss H-12 flying boat, which while larger and more capable than the H-4s, shared failings of a weak hull and poor water handling. The combination of the new Porte II hull, this time fitted with two steps, with the wings of the H-12, a new tail and powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines was named the Felixstowe F.2; its first flight was in July 1916,London 2003, pp. 24‚Äì25. proving greatly superior to the Curtiss on which it was based.Bruce Flight 2 December 1955, p. 846. The F.2 entered production as the Felixstowe F.2A, being used as a patrol aircraft, with about 100 being completed by the end of World War I. Another seventy were built, and these were followed by two F.2C which were built at Felixstowe. In February 1917, the first prototype of the Felixstowe F.3 was flown. This was larger and heavier than the F.2, giving it greater range and heavier bomb load, but poorer agility. Approximately 100 Felixstowe F.3s were produced before the end of the war. The Felixstowe F.5 was intended to combine the good qualities of the F.2 and F.3, with the prototype first flying in May 1918. The prototype showed superior qualities to its predecessors but the production version was modified to make extensive use of components from the F.3, in order to ease production, giving lower performance than either the F.2A or F.3. dazzle scheme during an anti-submarine patrol. The dazzle camouflage adopted aided identification during air combat and on the water in the event of being forced down. R. Leckie and G. E. Livock. Operational history The Felixstowe F.2A was used as a patrol aircraft over the North Sea until the end of the war. Its excellent performance and maneuverability made it an effective and popular type, often fighting enemy patrol and fighter aircraft, as well as hunting U-boats and Zeppelins. The larger F.3, which was less popular with its crews than the more maneuverable F.2A, served in the Mediterranean and the North Sea. The F.5 did not enter service until after the end of World War I, but replaced the earlier Felixstowe boats (together with Curtiss flying boats) to serve as the RAF's standard flying boat until being replaced by the Supermarine Southampton in 1925.

The airport, along with the marina, provide the only access to the rest of Washington state without first having to pass through British Columbia. In 2000, a new five-plane hangar was built. It also features several couches and serves as a makeshift waiting room.  History  Point Roberts Airpark was created by Ray Young. He was a cartoonist at Buena Vista Studios who had a lifelong interest in flying. Ray moved to the Pacific Northwest in 1967 and purchased land in Point Roberts, developing it into an air strip he called Ray Young Field. He moved to Point Roberts with his wife, Uvon, in 1972. Later, he bought more land and extended the runway to its current length. Ray died in 1985; wife Uvon closed the runway and put the land up for sale in 1990. In 1996, she sold it to Robin Lamb, a retired Air Canada captain with 22,000-plus hours total flight time. In the 1996-1998 period, using a 1955 Galion grader and a 1956 International TD-91 bulldozer, the airstrip was made usable again. The bulldozer cleared the trees, the grader put a crown on the runway and cleared the of the parking/air park area. In November 1998, the runway was seeded with a low-maintenance turf. In the intervening years, except for mowing, the runway has needed no further maintenance and is used year-round. Lamb died in 2012, and surviving family members named Romi Singh, a local pilot and airport consultant, as manager. Plans for the future include hangar homes and more hangar space.

Acquiring fame as a talmudic scholar, he studied under Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk and Rabbi Yechiel Michl of Zlotchov. Becoming one of the foremost spokesmen of the growing Chasidic movement in Poland, he began his career as Rabbi of Kolbuszowa. In 1800 he accepted the post of Rabbi of Apt, or Opat√≥w. Although he held many other rabbinic positions, to the chasidim he remained always the Apter Rov. In 1808 he was chosen as Rabbi of Ia≈üi, Moldavia. In the wake of communal strife there, he was forced to leave his post and settled in Mezhbizh, the home of the Baal Shem Tov and the cradle of Hasidism, where he devoted himself completely to the study and dissemination of Chasidism. His daughter, Rachel Ashkenazi, authored several original commentaries on the Torah. It was during this period in his life, in Mezhbizh, that he gained the veneration of thousands of followers, among whom were a number of the prominent rabbis of the age. His outstanding character trait was his strongly expressed love of the Jewish people, which earned him the title of Oheiv Yisrael, \\"Lover of Israel\\". Oheiv Yisrael became the title of the published collection of his thoughts arranged according to the weekly Torah portions. The work abounds with lofty kabbalistic insights and interpretations. It is one of the basic Chasidic texts and bespeaks the Apter Rov's passionate love of his fellow Jews. The Apter Rov is one of the most notable and beloved luminaries in the Hasidic firmament. On his deathbed, crying bitterly over the long exile, he said: \\"Before his demise Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berdichev promised that upon entering the World-to-Come he would not rest or sit until Mashiach would come. But they diverted his attention by teaching him lofty and mystical concepts until he forgot his pledge‚Äîbut I assure you, I will not forget.\\" He was buried in Mezhbizh, near the Baal Shem Tov. An ornate stone ohel marks his grave in the old Jewish cemetery. According to one Hasidic legend, angels subsequently carried his body and buried him in the Holy Land, and in the Jewish Cemetery in Tiberias there is a stone marking his supposed grave. The Hasidic dynasty of Mezhbizh/Zinkov Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of Apt was the founder of the Mezhbizh/Zinkover rabbinic dynasty. In honor of the dynasty's founder, his descendants adopted the family name Heshel.

The studio was started by engineer/innovator Paul Buff. The studio is known for its instrumental Surf music recordings such as \\"Wipe Out\\" and the original demo recording of \\"Pipeline\\". The first location was at 8020 North Archibald Avenue. Later, the studio moved down the street to 8040. Pal was also the training ground for a young Frank Zappa who worked at the studio starting in 1961. Zappa learned basic recording techniques at Pal. He recorded his first rock n' roll record, \\"Breaktime\\", by the Masters, which consisted of himself, Paul Buff, and Ronnie Williams. In 1964, Zappa bought the studio and renamed it Studio Z. Zappa lived at the studio building for a few months before it was closed in 1965. The building had to be torn down in order to widen North Archibald Avenue. Zappa made many other recordings at the studio. Some were released by small Los Angeles record companies, such as Original Sound. Other recordings were kept in his vault and released on albums such as Lumpy Gravy (1968), Mystery Disc (1985), The Lost Episodes (1996), and Cucamonga (1998). Paul Buff engineered the original demo recording of \\"Pipeline\\" by the Chantays and \\"Wipe Out\\" by the Surfaris using his unique custom built recording machine, which recorded 5 tracks on 1/2 inch recording tape. Buff went on to invent the Kepex, an acronym for KEyable Program EXpander (the opposite of an audio compressor). Paul Buff's Alison Research studio products became common on pop recordings (Alan Parsons would use a Kepexed drum sound to create the 'heartbeat' heard on Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon.) In 2012, Crossfire Productions (in partnership with Buff) released a 5-CDr collection containing 156 of Buff's PAL recordings entitled 'Paul Buff Presents: Highlights From the Pal And Original Sound Studio Archives'. The collection featured 58 Zappa-involved recordings including an early version of Why Don't You Do Me Right? (which later appeared in 1967 as the A-side of a Mothers Of Invention single) and the previously unreleased Zappa novelty song, \\"My Masked Grandma\\".

The western terminus of this spur route is at a T-intersection with the concurrency of U.S. Route 23 (US 23) and SR 104 about north of Waverly. Its eastern terminus is just to the east of that point at the boundary of Scioto Trail State Forest. Continuing east of that point is Stoney Creek Road, which traverses through the state forest in the direction of the Scioto River. From its inception in the middle of the 1930s, the primary function of SR 372 has been to provide access to the state forest from the state highway system. Route description The entirety of SR 372 is located within Franklin Township in rural southern Ross County. Beginning at a T-intersection with the US 23/SR 104 concurrency, SR 372 travels easterly into a series of curves in the shape of an \\"S\\", taking the route to the north and then bending to the southeast. As it passes amidst heavily wooded terrain with some houses alongside the roadway, SR 372 travels past an intersection with North Ridge Road, then abruptly comes to an end as it crosses the western boundary of Scioto Trail State Forest. The roadway continues eastward from this point as Stoney Creek Road. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) regularly does surveys to determine the amount of traffic that utilizes its highway system. Commonly, the volumes measured in these surveys are expressed in terms average annual daily traffic (AADT), or the amount of traffic volume on a given segment of a highway on any average day of the year. In 2010, ODOT determined that an average of 340 passenger vehicles per day and 20 commercial vehicles per day used SR 372. This state route is not a part of the National Highway System, a network of roadways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. History The SR 372 designation was established in 1934. Throughout its entire history, the highway has served to provide a connection to Scioto Trail State Forest from US 23. When it was first designated, all of SR 372 was gravel-surfaced. The state route was paved by 1958.

Because the Maldives does not have a navy, the MNDF Coast Guard functions as the armed maritime force of the nation with a charter to contribute to national defence and by and large to respond to issues related to the maritime security of the nation. Therefore, the Coast Guard is documented as the custodian of the Maldives Maritime Domain. Maritime security is a constituent ingredient of the national security in a maritime nation such as the Maldives and its significance is best understood when one perceives the island or the archipelagic nature of the country. After the new government took power in 2008, the Coast Guard has been the highest priority of the defense sector in Maldives. Four Coast Guard squadrons are deployed in the southern, central, and northern regions of Maldives, and a Strategic Reserve has been established at the capital, Male'. Missions * Defending the nation and its territorial integrity * Protecting the territorial waters and securing the resources of the Exclusive Economic Zone * Safeguarding the marine environment and Coastal Area * Enforcing the Maritime Law * Assisting the people and conducting search and rescue missions * Responding to national emergencies and crises * Providing support and mobility to other services of the MNDF  History  The roots of the MNDF Coast Guard lie in the 1570s Kalhuoffummi, as its insignia symbolizes, the legendary sailing boat used by the heroic Mohamed Thakurufaanu and his allies in his guerrilla battle to free the country from the invasion of the Portuguese. Until the establishment of the modern Coast Guard in 1980, the small speed boat section of the National Security Service was the maritime security service in the Maldives and it lays claim on being the Maldives oldest continuous seagoing force. The Coast Guard was established as a separate wing of the defence forces on 1 January 1980 with the late Colonel Hussain Fulhu as its first Commanding Officer. The Maldivian Coast Guard Air Elements was formed as the air wing of the Coast Guard in 1978 with one HAL Do 228 donated by India. In 2003 India Donated two HAL Dhruv's. Roles The MNDF Coast Guard has a dual role, with the strategic military application settling within the parameters of national defence and territorial integrity as the primary task while its secondary role is aimed at relatively non-military aspects of maritime security which covers areas such as maritime terrorism, transnational crime, drug trafficking through maritime routes, smuggling, piracy and so forth. In times of peace, Coast Guard is popular as a force of goodwill due to its endeavours in building bridges of friendship with the public. It reaches out to people and save their lives by intensely conducting well planned and executed Search and Rescue (SAR) operations at sea and assume other humanitarian roles in crises when the public is in need. Whilst most other military services of the MNDF are either at standby or training for the unseen hostile actions, the Coast Guard is deployed every day. With decentralized Coast Guard squadrons placed at Area Commands in North, Central and South of Maldives and a strategic reserve at the capital Male' under the new Strategic Defence Directive, and much responsibility placed on even the most junior sailors, the Coast Guard is frequently lauded for its quick responsiveness and adaptability in a broad range of tasks and emergencies. Strength Its capabilities were strengthened and modernised after the 3 November 1988 attack by People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam terrorists. After the 1988 incident, 6 British patrol craft were acquired. These were 4 Tracker II class, 1 Dagger class and 1 Cheverton class ships. In 1998, 3 vessels were built at the Colombo Dockyard. These are 2 Coastal Surveillance Vessels of 24 meters, CGS Ghazee and CGS Iskandhar and 1 Fast Landing Craft of 20 metres length. The CGS also acquired a 17-meter fire fighting vessel. After the 2004 tsunami, the need for larger vessels with off-shore patrol capabilities were given a high priority. The Indian Navy donated a Trinkat class patrol vessel of 46 metres length in April 2006, commissioned as CGS Huravee and is commanded by Lieutenant Mohamed Jamshad. Lt. Jamshad had been the executive officer of CGS Huravee. The Maldives Coast Guard has acquired two additional large offshore patrol craft, constructed at the Colombo Dockyard, Sri Lanka. These vessels are 42m and 35m in length. The 35m patrol craft was brought to Male on 21 April 2007 and commissioned as CGS Shaheedh Ali, commanded by Lieutenant Moahmed Fahumy. Lt Mohamed Fahumy was previously the executive officer of CGS Shaheed Ali.The 42m vessel was brought to Male on 11 November 2007 and commissioned as CGS Ghaazee. It is commanded by Lieutenant Ahmed Fathih. Lt Fathih was previously the executive officer of CGS Ghaazee. The Ghazee was renamed CGS Nooradheen after the Sultan who founded the Maldivian armed forces on 21 April 1892. In addition to these, the Coast Guard operates some small in-shore patrol craft. =Notable ships of the CGS fleet= * 2 x Tracker Mk II class Patrol Boat 1978-1979 ** 142 Kuredhi ** 151 Midhili * 1 x Tracker Class Patrol Boat ** 106 Nirolhu 1987‚Äìpresent * 1 x 17m class Patrol Boat 1980 ** 115 Burevi 1988 * 1 x Dagger class Patrol Boat 1982 ** 124 Funa * 1 x Cheverton class *2 x Israeli Dvora class fast patrol boat modified 24m - similar to Ultra Fast Attack Craft ** CGS Ghazee 42m 2002‚Äìpresent - now CGS Nooradheen ** CGS Iskandhar 1999‚Äìpresent *1 x Hamilton Jet Model HM422 Fast Landing Craft (WLCM) 2000‚Äìpresent ** L-301 * 1 x 17m fire rescue boat - modified patrol boat ** E-9 Fire and Rescue * 1 x Trinkat-class patrol vessel ** CGS Huravee * 1 x 42m Patrol Craft * 1 x 35m Patrol Craft ** CGS Shaheedh Ali * several RHIB  Coast guard operations  The MNDF coast guard has been vastly successful in securing after the modernization and expansion of their fleet. Counter-terrorist operations, anti-piracy missions, search and rescue operations as well as humanitarian operations. The MNDF coast guard has successfully taken down pirate ships illegally entering the EEZ of the Maldives, mostly from Somalia. Almost every year, the coast guard has been able to arrest and apprehend roughly 100-200 pirates and prevent illegal entries into the Maldivian territory in the past years.  Action of 17 May 2007  On 17 May 2007, a gun running ship that was carrying mortar bombs and guns while illegally intruding the EEZ of the Maldivian territory fired upon a Maldivian fishing vessel. The Maldivian fishing vessel quickly informed the Maldives Coast Guard which resulted in a standoff between the Tamil Tigers' gun runner boat and CGS Huravee of the coast guard. After repetitive attempts to make them surrender with peaceful negotiations, the boat still refused to comply and attempted to take offensive action against the coast guard. With little choice left, the coast guard ship CGS Huravee fired upon the boat and sank it.

Terminology  In a three-tier local education authority children begin their compulsory education in a first school or lower school, which caters for children up to the age of 8 or 9. Children then transfer to a middle school, which caters for children from age 9 to age 13 or 14. Following this, children transfer for the remainder of their compulsory education to an upper school or high school, sometimes on into the sixth form. Diagram of paths through the school system in England. The three-tier systems are in blue and mauve. History References to middle schools in publications of the UK Government date back to 1856, and the educational reports of William Henry Hadow mention the concept. It was not until 1963 that a local authority, the West Riding of Yorkshire, first proposed to introduce a middle-school system, with schools spanning ages 5‚Äì9, 9‚Äì13 and 13‚Äì18; one source suggests that the system was \\"introduced\\" in that year. Local education authorities were permitted to introduce middle schools by the Education Act 1964, subsequently, the notion of three-tier education was mooted by the Plowden Report of 1967 which proposed the introduction of first schools and middle schools, which would replace the existing system of infant and junior schools, as well as the first part of secondary schooling. The Plowden Report recommended that middle schools span ages 8 to 12. The first middle school in England was introduced in 1968, in the Hemsworth division of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The first authority-wide systems of middle schools were introduced in 1970, in Stoke-on-Trent and Southampton. Numbers rapidly grew, with over a thousand opening in the decade from the first introduction. Sources suggest reasons for the introduction of the three- tier system in local authority areas included capacity problems, as a result of both the raising of the school leaving age to 16 from 15 (which took place in 1972), and the introduction of comprehensive education, with the schools themselves bypassing the traditional Eleven-plus exam which determined which secondary school pupils would attend. The number of middle schools peaked in 1982, when over 1400 middle schools were open; by 2017, only 121 remained, and by 2019 the National Middle Schools' Forum recorded 107 in its directory, in 14 local authority areas. In 2006, it was reported that Central Bedfordshire, Northumberland and the Isle of Wight were the only LEAs still exclusively using the three-tier system. Multiple reasons have been suggested by sources for this reversion to a two-tier system, including: a lack of clear identity, with the Department for Education and Science labelling them as either primary or secondary; a lack of teachers trained to teach in middle schools; and increased autonomy being given to schools, with upper and lower schools choosing to expand their age ranges. The introduction of the National Curriculum has also been cited, as the middle school system led to children changing schools partway through one of its Key Stages; local authority officials in Wiltshire, when closing the remaining middle schools in 2002, argued that this caused them to be disadvantaged, and the National Curriculum was also cited as a reason for abolishing the system in Bradford by David Ward, then the councillor there responsible for education. In addition, in Northumberland it was reported that closing middle schools could allow the buildings to be sold to raise money for repairs to the remainder of the council's school estate. The Inter-LEA Middle Schools Forum was founded in 1991, later changing its name to the National Middle Schools' Forum; it describes itself as \\"the voice of the middle school community\\". In 2016, Nigel Huddleston raised the topic of three-tier education in Parliament; the schools minister, Nick Gibb, noted that the Government had no plans to abolish the three-tier system in the areas that retained it. Similar systems In Scotland, middle schools were operated in Grangemouth from 1974 to 1988, the system having been proposed in 1968. In the independent sector, some prep schools take pupils up to age 13. In addition, some private secondary schools admit pupils at 13, including some of those using the Common Entrance exam and some public schools. Gibraltar's education system has a system of first, middle and secondary schools.

Operation  Most PHP accelerators work by caching the compiled opcode/bytecode of PHP representation of php files to avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling source code on each request (some or even most of which may never be executed). To further improve performance, the cached code is stored in shared memory and directly executed from there, minimizing the amount of slow disk reads and memory copying at runtime.  Practical benefits  PHP accelerators substantially increase the speed of PHP applications. Improvements of web page generation throughput by factors of two to seven have been observed. The effect on application performance of opcode caching varies widely, depending on factors such as the inherent execution time of the PHP application and the percentage of source code actually executed on a given request, and whether additional optimization steps are performed. While a code optimizer may even slow down overall performance when used in isolation, it can provide an additional performance boost when coupled with a bytecode cache, as the optimization effort is performed just once.

He was selected as the 18th overall pick in the first round of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft by the Chicago White Sox. He has played in Major League Baseball for the White Sox and Kansas City Royals and in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Yomiuri Giants. Collegiate career Fields was a two-sport athlete at Oklahoma State University, playing both baseball and football. He was selected as a Big 12 Conference All-Star at third base in , and had a career batting average of .364 over three years. Fields also earned three letters as a quarterback for the Cowboys. He led the team to two bowl games, including setting the Cotton Bowl Classic record with 307 passing yards against the University of Mississippi. Professional career =Chicago White Sox= Entering , Fields was ranked as the fourth- best prospect in the White Sox organization and the 95th-best prospect in Major League Baseball by Baseball America. He hit safely in 14 straight games from August 6 ‚Äì August 21 for the Birmingham Barons, tied for the eighth- longest streak in the Southern League. Prior to the season, Fields was once again ranked as the fourth-best prospect in the White Sox organization by Baseball America. He homered in four consecutive games from May 11 ‚Äì May 14 with the Charlotte Knights, and was selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game at Pittsburgh's PNC Park. Fields made his major league debut on September 13, , but did not record his first major league at-bat until September 18. In that game against the Detroit Tigers, Fields hit a pinch-hit home run off Detroit's Jamie Walker. He became the third player in White Sox history to hit a home run in his first major league at-bat, joining Carlos Lee (May 7, ) and Miguel Olivo (September 15, ) as the only other White Sox to do so. Fields entered the season ranked as the second-best prospect in the White Sox organization and the 45th-best prospect in Major League Baseball by Baseball America. Although he started the season at Triple-A Charlotte, he was called up to the White Sox after a season ending back injury to third basemam Joe Crede. He recorded his first multi-home run game on August 10 against the Seattle Mariners, hitting both off starter Jarrod Washburn. On August 26, , Fields made his first start in left field, though he only played 21 games at that position before being moved back to third base. Fields ended his first season as a Major Leaguer by hitting a promising .244, 23 home runs, 67 RBI, and an OPS of .788 in 100 games. His 23 home runs tied him with Bill Melton for 3rd most home runs by a White Sox player in their rookie season, Melton did that in 157 games. Fields received one third-place vote for AL Rookie of the Year. Entering spring training for the season, Fields was expected to be the starting third baseman, with Joe Crede likely traded. However, Crede arrived at camp fully recovered from his injury and White Sox general manager Kenny Williams was said to be unsatisfied with the trade offers. This resulted in Crede being given the starting job and Fields once again beginning the season in Triple-A Charlotte. Fields had a disappointing, injury-riddled season with the Knights, in which he regressed to a .246 batting average and .772 OPS. On July 25, 2008, he was called up to play with the White Sox after Crede was put on the 15-day disabled list. Fields underwent arthroscopic knee surgery at the end of the 2008 season,RotoTimes.com ‚Äì Josh Fields ‚Äì Fields to undergo off-season surgery and was the White Sox's starting third baseman in until Gordon Beckham was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte on June 4 and took the position. On July 23, 2009, in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Fields hit a grand slam in his first plate appearance of the game. This would later end up being the game-winning home run in Mark Buehrle's perfect game over the Tampa Bay Rays, winning 5‚Äì0. Fields also caught the final out of the perfect game, a groundout to White Sox shortstop Alexei Ram√≠rez. Six days later he would be demoted to Triple A Charlotte to make room for newly acquired Mark Kotsay. =Kansas City Royals= On November 6, 2009, Fields, along with Chris Getz, was traded by the White Sox to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Mark Teahen. He played in 13 games for the Royals, hitting .306 during the 2010 season. =Pittsburgh Pirates/Colorado Rockies= On December 20, 2010, Fields was signed to a minor league contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates. However, on March 28 he was traded by the Pirates to the Colorado Rockies, at the conclusion of spring training, for either a player to be named later or cash considerations. He recorded a .365 batting average with the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox, before being released on June 28, in order to pursue a career in Japan. =Yomiuri Giants= Fields signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan on June 28, 2011. In 40 games in Japan he hit only .202. =Los Angeles Dodgers= He signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on January 4, 2012.

Random digit dialing has the advantage that it includes unlisted numbers that would be missed if the numbers were selected from a phone book. In populations where there is a high telephone-ownership rate, it can be a cost efficient way to get complete coverage of a geographic area. RDD is widely used for statistical surveys, including election opinion polling and selection of experimental control groups. When the desired coverage area matches up closely enough with country codes and area codes, random digits can be chosen within the desired area codes. In cases where the desired region doesn't match area codes (for instance, electoral districts), surveys must rely on telephone databases, and must rely on self-reported address information for unlisted numbers. Increasing use of mobile phones (although there are currently techniques which allow infusion of wireless phones into the RDD sampling frame), number portability, and VoIP have begun to decrease the ability for RDD to target specific areas within a country and achieve complete coverage.

It is a linearized Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann model, which assumes an extremely simplified model of electrolyte solution but nevertheless gave accurate predictions of mean activity coefficients for ions in dilute solution. The Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation provides a starting point for modern treatments of non-ideality of electrolyte solutions.  Overview  In the chemistry of electrolyte solutions, an ideal solution is a solution whose colligative properties are proportional to the concentration of the solute. Real solutions show departures from this kind of ideality at all but the very lowest concentrations (see, for example, Raoult's law). In order to accommodate these effects in the thermodynamics of solutions, the concept of activity was introduced: the properties are then proportional to the activities of the ions. Activity, a, is proportional to concentration, c. The proportionality constant is known as an activity coefficient, \\\\gamma.Wright, section 1.10 :a=\\\\gamma c/c^0 In an ideal electrolyte solution the activity coefficients of all the ions are equal to one. Ideality of electrolyte solution can be achieved only in very dilute solutions. Non-ideality of more concentrated solutions arises principally (but not exclusively) because ions of opposite charge attract each other due to electrostatic forces, while ions of the same charge repel each other. In consequence ions are not randomly distributed throughout the solution, as they would be in an ideal solution. Activity coefficients of single ions cannot be measured experimentally because an electrolyte solution must contain both positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. Instead, a mean activity coefficient, \\\\gamma_{\\\\pm} is defined. For example, with the electrolyte NaCl :\\\\gamma_{\\\\pm} = \\\\left(\\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm{Na^+}\\\\gamma _\\\\mathrm{Cl^-}\\\\right )^{1/2} In general, the mean activity coefficient of a fully dissociated electrolyte of formula AnBm is given byWright, Section 8.23 :\\\\gamma_{\\\\pm} = \\\\left({\\\\gamma_A}^n{\\\\gamma _B}^m\\\\right )^{1/(n+m)} Activity coefficients are themselves functions of concentration as the amount of inter-ionic interaction increases as the concentration of the electrolyte increases. Debye and H√ºckel developed a theory with which single ion activity coefficients could be calculated. By calculating the mean activity coefficients from them the theory could be tested against experimental data. It was found to give excellent agreement for \\"dilute\\" solutions.  The model  An idealized representation of a solution of a 1:1 electrolyte A description of Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory includes a very detailed discussion of the assumptions and their limitations as well as the mathematical development and applications.Wright, chapter 10. A snapshot of a 2-dimensional section of an idealized electrolyte solution is shown in the picture. The ions are shown as spheres with unit electrical charge. The solvent (pale blue) is shown as a uniform medium, without structure. On average, each ion is surrounded more closely by ions of opposite charge than by ions of like charge. These concepts were developed into a quantitative theory involving ions of charge z1e+ and z2e‚àí, where z can be any integer. The principal assumption is that departure from ideality is due to electrostatic interactions between ions, mediated by Coulomb's law: the force of interaction between two electric charges, separated by a distance, r in a medium of relative permittivity Œµr is given byWright, Section 10.3 :\\\\text{force} = \\\\frac {z_1z_2e^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon _0 \\\\epsilon _r r^2} It is also assumed that *The solute is completely dissociated; it is a strong electrolyte. *Ions are spherical and are not polarized by the surrounding electric field. Solvation of ions is ignored except insofar as it determines the effective sizes of the ions. *The solvent plays no role other than providing a medium of constant relative permittivity (dielectric constant). *There is no electrostriction. *Individual ions surrounding a \\"central\\" ion can be represented by a statistically averaged cloud of continuous charge density, with a minimum distance of closest approach. The last assumption means that each cation is surrounded by a spherically symmetric cloud of other ions. The cloud has a net negative charge. Similarly each anion is surrounded by a cloud with net positive charge.Wright, Section 10.3  Mathematical development  The deviation from ideality is taken to be a function of the potential energy resulting from the electrostatic interactions between ions and their surrounding clouds. To calculate this energy two steps are needed. The first step is to specify the electrostatic potential for ion j by means of Poisson's equation : abla^2 \\\\psi_j(r) = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon _0 \\\\epsilon _r}\\\\rho _j(r) œà(r) is the total potential at a distance, r, from the central ion and œÅ(r) is the averaged charge density of the surrounding cloud at that distance. To apply this formula it is essential that the cloud has spherical symmetry, that is, the charge density is a function only of distance from the central ion as this allows the Poisson equation to be cast in terms of spherical coordinates with no angular dependence.Wright, section 10.6.3 The second step is to calculate the charge density by means of a Boltzmann distribution. :n'_i = n_i \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\frac{-z_ie\\\\psi_j(r)}{k_{\\\\rm B}T}\\\\right) where kB is Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. This distribution also depends on the potential œà(r) and this introduces a serious difficulty in terms of the superposition principle. Nevertheless, the two equations can be combined to produce the Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann equation.Wright, section 10.6.8 : abla^2\\\\psi_j(r)=-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon_0\\\\epsilon_r} \\\\sum_i \\\\left\\\\\\\\{n_i(z_ie) \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{-z_ie\\\\psi_j(r)}{k_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\right)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} Solution of this equation is far from straightforward. Debye and H√ºckel expanded the exponential as a truncated Taylor series to first order. The zeroth order term vanishes because the solution is on average electrically neutral (so that ‚àë ni zi = 0), which leaves us with only the first order term. The result has the form of the Helmholtz equationWright, section 10.6.10 : abla^2\\\\psi_j(r)=\\\\kappa^2\\\\psi_j(r) \\\\qquad \\\\text{with} \\\\qquad \\\\kappa^2 = \\\\frac{e^2}{\\\\epsilon_0\\\\epsilon_r k_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\sum_i n_i z_i^2 , which has an analytical solution. This equation applies to electrolytes with equal numbers of ions of each charge. Nonsymmetrical electrolytes require another term with œà2. For symmetrical electrolytes, this reduces to the modified spherical Bessel equation :(\\\\partial_r^2 + \\\\frac{2}{r} \\\\partial_r - \\\\kappa^2) \\\\psi_j = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{with solutions} \\\\qquad \\\\psi_j(r) = A' \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\kappa r}}{r} + A \\\\frac{e^{\\\\kappa r}}{r} The coefficients A' and A are fixed by the boundary conditions. As r \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, \\\\psi must not diverge, so A = 0. At r = a_0, which is the distance of the closest approach of ions, the force exerted by the charge should be balanced by the force of other ions, imposing \\\\partial_r \\\\psi_j(a_0) = -z_j e/(4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\epsilon_r a_0^2), from which A' is found, yielding : \\\\psi_j(r) = \\\\frac{z_j e}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0\\\\varepsilon_r} \\\\frac{e^{\\\\kappa a_0}}{1+\\\\kappa a_0} \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\kappa r}}{r} The electrostatic potential energy, u_j, of the ion at r=0 is :u_j = z_j e \\\\Big( \\\\psi_j(a_0) - \\\\frac{z_j e}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0\\\\varepsilon_r} \\\\frac{1}{a_0} \\\\Big)= -\\\\frac{z_j^2 e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0\\\\varepsilon_r} \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{1+\\\\kappa a_0} This is the potential energy of a single ion in a solution. The multiple-charge generalization from electrostatics gives an expression for the potential energy of the entire solution (see also: Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation). The mean activity coefficient is given by the logarithm of this quantity as follows (see also: Extensions of the theory)Wright, section 10.6.15 Experimental \\\\log\\\\gamma_\\\\pm values for KBr at 25¬∞C (points)Data from Wright, Worked problem 8.17 and Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel limiting law (coloured line) :\\\\log_{10}\\\\gamma_\\\\pm = -Az_j^2 \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt I}{1 +Ba_0\\\\sqrt I} :A=\\\\frac{e^2B}{2.303 \\\\times 8\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0\\\\epsilon_r k_{\\\\rm B}T} :B=\\\\left( \\\\frac{2e^2 N}{\\\\epsilon_0\\\\epsilon_rk_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\right)^{1/2} where I is the ionic strength and a0 is a parameter that represents the distance of closest approach of ions. For aqueous solutions at 25 ¬∞C A = 0.51 mol‚àí1/2dm3/2 and B = 3.29 nm‚àí1mol‚àí1/2dm3/2Wright, section 10.7 The most significant aspect of this result is the prediction that the mean activity coefficient is a function of ionic strength rather than the electrolyte concentration. For very low values of the ionic strength the value of the denominator in the expression above becomes nearly equal to one. In this situation the mean activity coefficient is proportional to the square root of the ionic strength. This is known as the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel limiting law.  Limitations and extensions  The first solvation shell of a sodium ion dissolved in water. The oxygen atoms are arranged at the vertices of an octahedron with the sodium ion at its centre This equation for \\\\log\\\\gamma_\\\\pm gives satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements for low electrolyte concentrations, typically less than 10‚àí3 mol/L. Deviations from the theory occur at higher concentrations and with electrolytes that produce ions of higher charges, particularly unsymmetrical electrolytes. Essentially these deviations occur because the model is oversimplified, so there is little to be gained making small adjustments to the model.Wright, section 10.9. The individual assumptions can be challenged in turn. *Complete dissociation. Ion association may take place, particularly with ions of higher charge. This was followed up in detail by Niels Bjerrum. The Bjerrum length is the separation at which the electrostatic interaction between two ions is comparable in magnitude to kT. *Weak electrolytes. A weak electrolyte is one that is not fully dissociated. As such it has a dissociation constant. The dissociation constant can be used to calculate the extent of dissociation and hence, make the necessary correction needed to calculate activity coefficients. *Ions are spherical, not point charges and are not polarized. Many ions such as the nitrate ion, NO3‚àí, are not spherical. Polyatomic ions are also polarizable. *Role of the solvent. The solvent is not a structureless medium but is made up of molecules. The water molecules in aqueous solution are both dipolar and polarizable. Both cations and anions have a strong primary solvation shell and a weaker secondary solvation shell. Ion‚Äìsolvent interactions are ignored in Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory. Moreover, ionic radius is assumed to be negligible, but at higher concentrations, the ionic radius becomes comparable to the radius of the ionic atmosphere. Most extensions to Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory are empirical in nature. They usually allow the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation to be followed at low concentration and add further terms in some power of the ionic strength to fit experimental observations. The main extensions are the Davies equation, Pitzer equations and specific ion interaction theory. =Electrolytes mixtures= The theory can be applied also to dilute solutions of mixed electrolytes. Freezing point depression measurements has been used to this purpose.R. Wasoe, Phys. Z., 30 (1929), 412  Conductivity  Forces affecting a charged ion or cloud moving in an electric field The treatment given so far is for a system not subject to an external electric field. When conductivity is measured the system is subject to an oscillating external field due to the application of an AC voltage to electrodes immersed in the solution. Debye and H√ºckel modified their theory in 1926 and their theory was further modified by Lars Onsager in 1927. All the postulates of the original theory were retained. In addition it was assumed that the electric field causes the charge cloud to be distorted away from spherical symmetry.Wright, section 12.3 After taking this into account, together with the specific requirements of moving ions, such as viscosity and electrophoretic effects, Onsager was able to derive a theoretical expression to account for the empirical relation known as Kohlrausch's Law, for the molar conductivity, Œõm. :\\\\Lambda_m =\\\\Lambda_m^0-K\\\\sqrt{c} \\\\Lambda_m^0 is known as the limiting molar conductivity, K is an empirical constant and c is the electrolyte concentration. Limiting here means \\"at the limit of the infinite dilution\\"). Onsager's expression is :\\\\Lambda_m =\\\\Lambda_m^0-(A+B\\\\Lambda_m^0 )\\\\sqrt{c} where A and B are constants that depend only on known quantities such as temperature, the charges on the ions and the dielectric constant and viscosity of the solvent. This is known as the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel‚ÄìOnsager equation. However, this equation only applies to very dilute solutions and has been largely superseded by other equations due to Fuoss and Onsager, 1932 and 1957 and later.Wright, sections 12.10 to 12.17  References  Category:Thermodynamic models Category:Electrochemistry Category:Equilibrium chemistry Category:Peter Debye ","title":"Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory"},{"id":"7729305","text":"Lom stave church, by Lindahl Axel Theodor Lindahl (27 July 1841 - 11 December 1906) was a Swedish photographer notable for his early photography of Norwegian landscapes.

The Fabulous Clipjoint is also the first of seven detective novels featuring the nephew/uncle team of Ed and Am Hunter.Amazon customer review The subsequent novels in the series are The Dead Ringer, The Bloody Moonlight, Compliments of a Fiend, Death Has Many Doors, The Late Lamented, and Mrs Murphy's Underpants. Plot When teenaged Ed Hunter's alcoholic father is murdered, Ed is for all intents and purposes orphaned, as he feels little affection for his mean-spirited stepmother and hypersexual stepsister. The police dismiss the case as nothing more than the random murder of a back-alley drunk, and so Ed decides to investigate the crime on his own. Ed enlists the help of his father's brother, Ambrose \\"Am\\" Hunter, an itinerant carny, whom he has not seen in many years, and the two of them set out to solve the crime. Together they wade through a swamp of unseemly characters of the Chicago underworld to expose the real murderer of Ed's father. Along the way, with Am's guidance, Ed comes to realize that his father was not the hapless, pathetic man he had always believed him to be. Critical reception The Fabulous Clipjoint, like most of Brown's works, is notable for its solid craftsmanship, atmosphere, and suspense. In 1948 it received the Edgar Award for Best First Novel,Amazon Editorial review which marks the only occasion Brown was nominated for the award.

Born in London, he went to sea at 18 (or before) and while on board the 2nd Voyage of the Lord Nelson, was captured by the French on 14 August 1803. He was imprisoned in Givet and Sarrelivre prison camps, where he learnt his trade of shoe making. Thomas Shone was not a member of the Royal Navy, but an Ordinary Seaman, joining the East India Company in 1802, as per ships' documents and French POW records. With the aid of French Freemasons he escaped to England where he started a family in London. In 1820 his three children were Wesleyan, baptised soon before boarding Nautilus with his wife Sarah Phillips, and sailed to Algoa Bay. He had joined a party as a labourer, despite his ability to read and write. As part of the Scott party, which meant he was bound to work at his master's command, almost as a slave for five years to repay the cost of his voyage, they were settled close to the Xhosa border and were the last to leave after the first Xhosa war broke out, losing their entire belongings. He built up a second farm which was again burnt down in a later border war. On the death of his wife Sarah in 1837 he became melancholy and decided to write a daily journal, which he continued for 30 years. The journal provides insight into the day-to-day lives of the 1820 Settlers and their hardships. It is located at the Cory Library at Rhodes University. His grandson, Thomas Leopold Hamilton Shone, founded the manganese mining industry in South Africa; another of his other grandsons, Edward Clement Roberts, was the first man to mine anthracite in the Maclear district of South Africa.

Topics The book deals with the evolving concept of universal jurisdiction, the doctrine of humanitarian intervention, legal questions of international terrorism, and whether international criminal justice can at all be practiced in the absence of a global balance of power. The book analyzes the various international criminal courts since Nuremberg and provides a critical assessment of the prospects of the International Criminal Court. It challenges the assumption of established legal theory in which the normative framework of criminal justice can be abstracted from actual power relations and offers elements of a new doctrine on the \\"dialectical relationship\\" between power and law.

It is one of the most revered arts throughout the history of Iran. History Example showing Nasta ølƒ´q's proportion rules. =History of Nasta'liq= After the introduction of Islam in the 7th century, Persians adapted the Arabic alphabet to Persian and developed the contemporary Persian alphabet. The Arabic alphabet has 28 characters. An additional four letters were added by Iranians [2], which resulted in the 32 letters currently present in the Persian alphabet. Around one thousand years ago, Ibn Muqlah () and his brother created six genres of Iranian calligraphy, namely \\"Mohaqiq\\", \\"Reyhan\\", \\"Sols\\", \\"Naskh\\", \\"Toqi\\" and \\"Reqa\\". These genres were common for four centuries in Persia. In the 7th century (Hijri calendar), Hassan Farsi Kateb combined the \\"Naskh\\" and \\"Reqah\\" styles and invented a new genre of Persian calligraphy named \\"Ta'liq\\". In the 14th century, Mir Ali Tabrizi combined two major scripts of his time, i.e. Naskh and Taliq, and created a new Persian calligraphic style called \\"Nas‚Äôtaliq\\"[2]. In the past 500 years Nasta ølƒ´q (also anglicized as Nastaleeq; ') has been the predominant style for writing the Perso-Arabic script. In the 17th century Morteza Gholi Khan Shamlou and Mohammad Shafi Heravi created a new genre called cursive Nasta ølƒ´q Shekasteh Nasta ølƒ´q ()). Almost a century later, Abdol-Majid Taleqani, who was a prominent artist at the time, brought this genre to its highest level. This calligraphic style is based on the same rules as Nas‚Äôtaliq. However, cursive Nas‚Äôtaliq has a few significant differences: it provides more flexible movements, and it is slightly more stretched and curved. Yadollah Kaboli is one of the most prominent contemporary calligraphers within this style. File:Yaali zikr qayam qaim ast.jpgPersian calligraphy. File:Sultan 'Ali Mashhadi (Persian, 1442-1519).

Giovanni was the most prominent member of the family of luthiers . Other members included Andrea Grancino, Francesco Grancino, Gianbattista Grancino (or Giovanni Battista Grancino) and Paolo Grancino. Their instruments were played by Yehudi Menuhin (violin), Siegfried Palm (cello) and Adrian Beers (double bass), among others. Grancino's workshops were all located on Contrada Larga, now Via Larga in Milan. His instruments bear the characteristic segno della corona (mark of the crown). See German source in Bibliography. Although the luthiers of Milan created instruments of varying quality, Grancino's violins, violas, cellos and double basses are considered superior. Grancino used a varnish which was a finely textured clear yellow to pale brown color. Grancino's early instrument patterns and designs were influenced by Niccol√≤ Amati of Cremona, whose impressive works influenced many Italian luthiers of the period. However, Grancino's later productions show flatter arching and narrower form under the influence of Stradivari. Grancino's cellos tend to be larger than others, yet with a clear sound characteristic of the Italian luthiers. The Grancino manufactory was continued by members of the Testore family.von L√ºtgendorff, II, p.508ff. The eldest of them, Carlo Giuseppe Testore, built a violin for Grancino which is now housed in the National Music Museum on the campus of the University of South Dakota. Among Grancino's students was the Milanese luthier Giovanni Vasallo.von L√ºtgendorff, II, p.532. Grancino's violins play an interesting role in fiction. Canadian author, Emily-Jane Hills Orford's (born Toronto, 1957) novel, \\"Spring\\" (PublishAmerica 2005), features a Grancino violin with a mystery to unravel. American Harold Decker's self-published novel, \\"I, Giulia: The View Through F-Holes,\\" recounts the life of his treasured Grancino violin. Canadian children's performer, Peggy Hills, (born Toronto 1950) also featured a Grancino violin in her children's recording, \\"Peggy's Violin\\", which was nominated for a Juno in 2007.

The One Unit Scheme () was a geopolitical programme launched by the Government of Pakistan led by the then-Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra on 22 November 1954. The government claimed that the programme would overcome the difficulty of administering the two unequal polities of West and East Pakistan separated from each other by more than a thousand miles. To diminish the differences between the two regions, claimed the government, the 'One Unit' programme merged the four provinces of West Pakistan into a single province to parallel the East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Pakistani scholars and researchers maintain that the One Unit programme was viewed as a counterbalance against the political and population domination of the ethnic Bengali population of East Pakistan. The One Unit program was met with great resistance and grievances were raised by the four provinces since its establishment. The National Awami Party successfully sponsored a bill in the National Assembly calling for its dissolution and providing for regional autonomy. This led to the military takeover of the national government. The One Unit programme remained in effect until 1970. Finally, President General Yahya Khan imposed Legal Framework Order No. 1970 to end the One Unit program and reinstate the provisional status of the Four Provinces as of August 1947. History of 'One Unit Scheme' Although (according to the official Pakistan history), Pakistan was conceived by philosopher Sir Muhammad Iqbal in 1930 (uniting the four states of the northwestern British Indian Empire), the country was established on 14 August 1947, directly resulting from the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Since then, the country had been without a consolidated written constitution, and all Pakistan's state affairs had been run under constitutional acts of the British Indian Empire, such as the Government of India Act 1935 and the Indian Independence Act 1947. The Government had prolonged difficulty in administrating East Bengal, with its border with Eastern India, and the four provinces, which border Western India, Iran, China, and Afghanistan. One Unit was conceived by then-Governor-General Malik Ghulam and drafting was completed by then-chief Minister Mumtaz Ali Doltana. The first official announcement about it was made on 22 November 1954. Rationalizing the framework, Bogra enumerated the benefits of having one unit or province: \\"There will be no Bengalis, no Punjabis, no Sindhis, no Pathans, no Balochis, no Bahawalpuris, no Khairpuris. The disappearance of these groups will strengthen the integrity of Pakistan.\\" The History And Culture of Pakistan, by Nigel Kelly.

Retrieved 16 August 2015 After the 1954 general election, the four provinces and Tribal Areas were merged in the western wing. The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Lahore. The province of East Bengal (including Sylhet and the Hill Tracts) was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial capital at Dacca. The federal government moved the country's capital in the beginning of the year 1959 from Karachi to Rawalpindi (serving as provisional capital until town planning of the Islamabad was carried out and accomplished. West Pakistan formed a single and united political entity but with marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions. The One Unit policy was regarded as an administrative reform that would reduce expenditure and help eliminate ethnic and parochial prejudices. However, with the military coup of 1958, trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President claimed executive power over West Pakistan.

Marcellus was martyred with a sword by the deputy Praetorian prefect.

During the birthday celebrations for the Emperor Maximian, in July 298, Marcellus publicly demonstrated his Christian faith by throwing down the insignia of his rank, and proclaimed that he only venerated one God. He was then sent to Tangiers to be judged by the vice-prefect (vicar), Agricolanus. He was condemned to death and decapitated on October 29, 298, together with his wife Nona and his twelve sons (Claudius, Lupercus, Victorius, Facundus, Primitivus, Servandus, Germanus, Faustus, Januarius, and Martial). Included in this group of sons are the martyrs Emeterius and Celedonius, though their connection to Marcellus is probably apocryphal. Servandus and Germanus (or Cermanus) were venerated separately at Cadiz, and their association with Marcellus is also apocryphal.Catholic Online ‚Äì Saints & Angels: \\"Sts.

They were said to have been martyred at Le√≥n, Spain, during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian. Their relationship to Marcellus is probably apocryphal, though it was accepted in subsequent breviaries and hagiographies as well as the Roman Martyrology, which placed all four saints under October 30.Santi e beati: \\"Santi Claudio, Luperco e Vittorico\\" However, it is quite possible that Claudius, Lupercus, and Victorius were soldiers of Spanish origin who were killed at Le√≥n, as tradition states. Many churches in Spain were dedicated to them, including the ancient Benedictine abbey of San Claudio, in Galicia.\\"Claudius, Lupercus & Victorius, MM, (RM)\\" The town of San Claudio, near Oviedo, takes its name from this group of martyrs. Their relics were translated several times in succeeding centuries. King Ferdinand I of Castile transported some of their relics to the church of San Isidoro in Le√≥n. In 1173, the relics were translated to a new church dedicated to the three martyrs. This church was destroyed in 1834 and the relics were moved to the church of San Marcelo, dedicated to their presumed father. Their feast day is celebrated in Spain and Portugal on October 30.

Noted in the discipline of Korean archaeology and ancient art history (Yoon 2006), he was one of the first people recognized as an archaeologist in Korea to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree. Kim graduated from New York University in 1959 and was known in the latter part of his career as the \\"Doyen of Korean Archaeology\\" (Nelson 1995). He, along with others such as Kim Jeong-hak (Korea University), Kim Jae-won (Seoul National University), Kim Jung-bae (Korea University), Kim Jong-gi, Son Bo-gi (Yonsei University), and Lee Eun-chang are pioneers of modern Korean academia who were influenced not only by the discipline of archaeology but history, art history, architecture, and Korean philosophy. Education and career Kim began his studies at Keij≈ç Imperial University, the precursor of Seoul National University (SNU), during the Japanese colonization of Korea (1905 - 1945), and graduated from there with a bachelor's degree in 1945. He wrote his PhD thesis on Silla ceramics, and after receiving his New York University (NYU) PhD, Kim returned to South Korea. He started as a professor at SNU in 1961 and began a long and influential career there, with the exception of 1970-1971 when he served as the director of the National Museum of Korea. Kim was a founding member of the Department of Archaeology and Ancient Art History at SNU. In South Korea, the academic juxtaposition of archaeology and ancient art history is partly a reflection of the status of such studies in traditional Korean and Northeast Asian culture. However, the mixing of the two is also a reflection of the combination of education that Kim Won-yong received at Keij≈ç Imperial University and NYU. The Department of Ancient Art History and Archaeology at SNU became the main model for the establishment of similar departments at national universities across South Korea. Contributions to archaeology It is difficult to overstate the importance of Kim's contributions in Korean archaeology. Kim Won-yong did research on all aspects and all periods of Korean prehistory and early history, and can be considered as the 'Father of Korean Archaeology'. However, Kim will be remembered for laying the foundation of academic archaeology, symbolized by the publication in 1973 of his seminal work, Hanguk Gogohak Gaeseol [Introduction to Korean Archaeology]. This influential book was reprinted 20 times between 1973 and 1996 and remains a must on the reading list of all students of Korean prehistory and early history. Kim published hundreds of articles and excavation reports over his career in Korean, English, and Japanese. He also trained many generations of the leading archaeologists in Korea. Kim Won-yong realized the importance of Korean ancient and prehistoric cultural heritage, and served as a Senior Committee member of the National Cultural Heritage Committee of Korea from 1958 to 1992. He was a great proponent of academic exchange with western archaeology, and as such did research with archaeologists such as Richard J. Pearson. Kim was also a vocal critic of the New Archaeology (Processualism) from its inception in the early 1960s, publishing several key letters to the editor in American Antiquity that were critical of the 'new' theoretical movement and defended the 'old guard' of functional and cultural historical archaeology. Sambul Kim Won-yong was also an artist. He painted traditional monochromatic ink pieces, multi-coloured ink paintings, and whimsical self-portraits. Kim took the nom-de-plume \\"Sambul\\" (Hanja: ‰∏â‰Ωõ) to sign his paintings. A true intellectual giant on the vanguard of the rebirth of the Republic of Korea in the wake of the crippling Japanese occupation of 1910 - 1945 and the devastating war of 1950 - 1953, Sambul Kim Won-yong died of cancer on November 14, 1993.

The Cry of the Wolf was Burgess's first novel.

Retrieved 13 August 2012. Plot summary : Tagline: : Always before, he had been the Hunter. Now he had been the prey and he had survived. He would live. He would kill again. The book tells the story of a man who tries to kill the last wild wolves in England, and the wolf, raised among humans, who will try to strike back. What if there were still wolves in England and only a few people knew it? What if one of those people was an obsessive, half-mad, extremely able hunter who was determined to have the honour of killing the last wolf in England? We are with the last wolf cubs as they are born short minutes before the slaughter begins. The female survives, wounded by The Hunter, only long enough to teach her sole surviving cub a few skills before she too is killed by the man. The cub, Greycub, is reared by Ben and his family and, being a social animal, waits in vain for the sound or scent of a remaining wolf. This is not to be for he is the last wolf in England. Regretfully leaving his human friends, he roams for years searching for sign of his species. Finally, Greycub becomes the hunter and kills The Hunter. Analysis This is a raw and brutal book and, to be sure, a cautionary tale about extinction. However, the focus is on obsession verging on madness. Ben, the boy who rears Greycub, becomes an innocent betrayer of the wolves for it is he who first alerts The Hunter to the presence of the wolf pack. The book reads like non-fiction with an almost detached manner but the brutality is so compelling that detachment on the part of the reader is nearly impossible. In fact, the feelings of readers would make for a fascinating discussion. At which point did they become engaged? Did they ever feel any sympathy for The Hunter? How did the author do that? Also, there is some anthropomorphism present. Could Burgess have done the book without it? Characters =Animals= Greycub ‚Äì Son of Silver and Conna.

The fan-in of each gate is bounded by a polynomial and the depth of the circuit is bounded by a constant. ACC0, sometimes called ACC, is a class of computational models and problems defined in circuit complexity, a field of theoretical computer science. The class is defined by augmenting the class AC0 of constant-depth \\"alternating circuits\\" with the ability to count; the acronym ACC stands for \\"AC with counters\\"., p. 126 Specifically, a problem belongs to ACC0 if it can be solved by polynomial- size, constant-depth circuits of unbounded fan-in gates, including gates that count modulo a fixed integer. ACC0 corresponds to computation in any solvable monoid. The class is very well studied in theoretical computer science because of the algebraic connections and because it is one of the largest concrete computational models for which computational impossibility results, so-called circuit lower bounds, can be proved. Definitions Informally, ACC0 models the class of computations realised by Boolean circuits of constant depth and polynomial size, where the circuit gates includes \\"modular counting gates\\" that compute the number of true inputs modulo some fixed constant. More formally, a language belongs to AC0[m] if it can be computed by a family of circuits C1, C2, ..., where Cn takes n inputs, the depth of every circuit is constant, the size of Cn is a polynomial function of n, and the circuit uses the following gates: AND gates and OR gates of unbounded fan-in, computing the conjunction and disjunction of their inputs; NOT gates computing the negation of their single input; and unbounded fan-in MOD-m gates, which compute 1 if the number of input 1s is a multiple of m. A language belongs to ACC0 if it belongs to AC0[m] for some m. In some texts, ACCi refers to a hierarchy of circuit classes with ACC0 at its lowest level, where the circuits in ACCi have depth O(login) and polynomial size. The class ACC0 can also be defined in terms of computations of nonuniform deterministic finite automata (NUDFA) over monoids. In this framework, the input is interpreted as elements from a fixed monoid, and the input is accepted if the product of the input elements belongs to a given list of monoid elements. The class ACC0 is the family of languages accepted by a NUDFA over some monoid that does not contain an unsolvable group as a subsemigroup., Computational power The class ACC0 includes AC0. This inclusion is strict, because a single MOD-2 gate computes the parity function, which is known to be impossible to compute in AC0. More generally, the function MODm cannot be computed in AC0[p] for prime p unless m is a power of p., The class ACC0 is included in TC0. It is conjectured that ACC0 is unable to compute the majority function of its inputs (i.e. the inclusion in TC0 is strict), but this remains unresolved as of July 2018. Every problem in ACC0 can be solved by circuits of depth 2, with AND gates of polylogarithmic fan-in at the inputs, connected to a single gate computing a symmetric function. These circuits are called SYM+-circuits. The proof follows ideas of the proof of Toda's theorem. proves that ACC0 does not contain NEXPTIME. The proof uses many results in complexity theory, including the time hierarchy theorem, IP = PSPACE, derandomization, and the representation of ACC0 via SYM+ circuits.Addendum to Arora, Barak textbook It is known that computing the permanent is impossible for LOGTIME-uniform ACC0 circuits, which implies that the complexity class PP is not contained in LOGTIME-uniform ACC0.

The town is on the Brisbane River, west of the state capital, Brisbane, and north of Ipswich. History Lowood was established as the first terminus of the Brisbane Valley branch railway in 1884 and the town grew from the subdivision around the new station. The name is derived from the \\"low woods\\" of brigalow in the Lowood area, as opposed to the taller trees elsewhere in the Brisbane Valley. Lowood Post Office opened on 15 October 1888 (a receiving office had been open from 1884). In 1919, 27 building sites in Morningside Estate were advertised for auction by Kavanagh & Smith Auctioneers. The auction was for resubs 1 to 27 of sub 5 of resub 1 of subs 1A & 3 of resub 2 of sub A of portion 319 (Tarampa). A map produced to advertise the auction shows Morningside Estate is on Peace Street and is close to Lowood Railway Station, the hospital and the state school. The Lowood public library opened in 2000. Intact but abandoned Lowood railway station - the railway line and grassed area are now the Jean Bray Carpark. At the 2006 census, Lowood had a population of 1,010. In the 2011 census, Lowood had a population of 3,336 people. Due to its proximity to Brisbane and Ipswich, Lowood is becoming an area for hobby farmers and residential commuters. Nearby Lake Wivenhoe is a popular place for activities such as boating and fishing.  Heritage listings  Lowood has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 12 Railway Street: former Royal Bank of Queensland, built sometime between 1901 and 1917, the former bank is now a dental surgery. Airfield During World War II, an airfield called Lowood, which was actually located at Mount Tarampa, was the site of a military airfield operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. No. 71 Squadron operated from the airfield during 1943, conducting coastal patrol and naval convoy escort missions. After the war, the airfield was converted into a motor-racing circuit, the Lowood Airfield Circuit, and operated for 20 years, the highlight hosting the 1960 Australian Grand Prix.Australian Grand Prix - The 50-race history, 1986, pages 256 to 266 The airfield no longer exists, but a small memorial marks its previous location.Oz at war - Amateur historian site -Retrieved 2 November 2006.

The novel describes the events and social circumstances that lead up to, and form the aftermath of, a fictional school shooting. The story is presented in the form of segments of transcribed post- incident interviews with students, parents, teachers, and community members, compiled by Denise Shipley, a journalism student who is the stepsister of one of the shooters. The interviews provide a variety of viewpoints on the incident ‚Äì some sympathetic, others hostile. Interspersed through the book are footnotes providing statistical information about guns and gun violence. The plot has some similarities to the real-life Columbine High School massacre of April 20, 1999, although Strasser began research on the book before the Columbine shooting. The book was the first book relating to school shootings published after Columbine. Summary Brendan Lawlor and Gary Searle are students at Middletown High School. Gary has lived in town since second grade, while Brendan is a new arrival. The two quickly become friends. They are subjected to verbal and physical bullying by football players at Middletown, which teachers and parents fail to notice, downplay, or outright ignore. As time passes, both boys become darker and angrier, experimenting with alcohol and drugs, becoming obsessive about violent video games, and withdrawing from most social activities. Eventually the boys begin to obsess over the possibility of acting on their violent impulses. Gary experiments with developing a powerful homemade bomb. Gary and Brendan steal semi-automatic guns from a neighbour. Meanwhile, students are excited about an upcoming dance to be held in the school's gym. On the night of the dance, Brendan leaves a cryptic message for his friend Emily, warning her not to attend because there will be trouble. Masked, Brendan and Gary enter the gym just after the dance begins. They shoot out the lights before restraining the attendees with cable ties. Gary booby-traps the doors with bombs so they will explode if anyone tries to open them. The pair approach the football team's quarterback, Sam, who has been one of their main tormentors. After some debate, they decide to shoot out his kneecaps so he will be unable to play football ever again. Gary and Brendan fire their guns randomly around the gym, scaring students and injuring others. Another football player, Dustin, manages to get free and unties some others. Gary commits suicide while Brendan is beaten into a coma by the football players. Brendan suffers irreversible brain damage from the beating and those responsible are arrested and put on trial for attempted murder. The book ends with Denise Shipley, Gary's stepsister, wondering if Gary knew if there were other options besides violence. She swears she will always treat others with respect and teach others to do the same. She also shares her belief that semi-automatic weapons should be outlawed and handguns should be only in the hands of law enforcement. Denise ends up dating Sam Flach.

The 1976 arms are based on those of its predecessor, the county borough of Bradford. Symbolism The red and blue \\"per pale\\" division of the shield, gold engrailed chevron and buglehorns were taken directly from the county borough's arms. The buglehorns refer to the service by which the manor of Bradford was granted by John of Gaunt to John Northrop of Manningham: upon the blowing of a horn on St Martin's day Manningham was to wait on John and his heirs and conduct them safely to Pontefract Castle. In the county borough's arms there were three horns: one has been replaced by a golden fleece. This is an emblem of the woollen industry and was found in the arms or devices of five urban districts included in the metropolitan borough in 1974. On the chevron is an heraldic fountain from the arms of borough of Keighley and Ilkley urban district. A bordure or border has been added to the shield, on which are placed eleven white roses, representing the eleven Yorkshire councils combined in 1974. The crest features a boar's head without a tongue. This illustrates the legend of the boar of Cliffe Wood. The supporters are a gold stag from the arms of the Cavendish family, associated with Keighley; and an angora goat, another emblem of the woollen industry. The motto is Progress, Industry, Humanity. Blazon The formal description of the arms, or blazon, is: For the arms: Per pale gules and azure on a chevron engrailed between in chief two hunting horns and in base a fleece Or a fountain all within a bordure gobony gules and argent in the gules eleven roses argent barbed and seeded proper; and for the crest: A mural crown per pale gules and azure thereon a boar's head couped at the neck sans tongue erased Or; and for the supporters: To the dexter a stag Or gorged with acollar azure charged with roses argent barbed and seeded proper and to the sinister an angora goat argent armed Or gorged with a collar gules charged with roses argent barbed and seeded proper, the whole upon a Compartment of rocky moorland proper.

Immaculata High School opened in 1956 as a part of Immaculate Conception Parish. Immaculata answered a growing need for Catholic secondary education on the Westbank. Located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans, the School Sisters of Notre Dame served Immaculata from its inception until May 1979. In August 1979, the Salesian Sisters came to Immaculata. The founding pastor, Msgr. Paul Gaudin, envisioned a girls' school. At the time, however, the absence of a boys' Catholic High School in the area prompted parents to seek admission also for their sons. On September 10, 1956, Immaculata High School opened its doors to 50 freshmen. In 1960, 24 students comprised the first graduating class; the total enrollment was 188 in that year. Immaculata continued as a co-ed school until the opening of Archbishop Shaw High School in 1962. Archbishop Shaw began with only a Freshman class of 9th grade boys and added successive grades each year thereafter. Immaculata phased out the admission of boys within each grade that Archbishop Shaw accommodated, until 1966, when Immaculata awarded diplomas to the last 9 boys to attend the school. Immaculata/Blenk Merger After the 2006‚Äì2007 school year, Immaculata High School and Archbishop Blenk High School, both located on the West Bank, are supposed to merge. The new school will be called The Academy of Our Lady. Alumni, parents of students, and students have protest against this merge. One group of concerned parents, students and alumni have created a website called Stop The Merger to pass along information in the hope of preventing the merge of Archbishop Blenk and Immaculata.https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001525/http://www.stopthemerger.net/ The new school, like Immaculata, will be run by the Salesian Sisters.

Ben Greenman (born September 28, 1969) is a novelist and magazine journalist who has written fiction and non- fiction books, as well as many collaborations with pop-music artists like Questlove, George Clinton, Brian Wilson, Gene Simmons, and others. From 2000 to 2014, he was an editor at The New Yorker. Books In 2001 McSweeneys published Greenman's debut, Superbad, a collection of humor pieces and serious short fiction that included several satirical musicals. It has the same title as, but not the same contents as, the popular teen comedy; Greenman engaged in a fake feud with Seth Rogen over the title. The book's cover art was a painting by the artist Mark Tansey. Greenman's next book, Superworse, the Novel: A Remix of Superbad, was published in 2004 by Soft Skull, an independent Brooklyn publisher. It refashioned the book into a novel that was overseen and edited by a man named Laurence Once. Kirkus called it \\"something extraordinary.\\" In 2007, Macadam/Cage published Greenman's second collection of stories. It was selected by Barnes and Noble for its Discover Great Writers series, and included both comic work and more serious stories like \\"In the Air Room,\\" which fictionalized the famous controversy over James McNeill Whistler and the Peacock Room. Elizabeth Gold, writing on SFGate, said that \\"the best of the stories in this collection are more than funny.\\" Correspondences In 2008, Hotel St. George press released a handmade and letterpress-printed edition of Greenman's book Correspondences that included an intricate book casing that unfolded to reveal three accordion books and a postcard. The project was reviewed favorably by the Los Angeles Times and Time Out. In 2009, Melville House published Greenman's second novel, which was a fictionalized biography of a funk-rock star based loosely on Sly Stone, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, and others. The funk-rock star Swamp Dogg recorded a theme song for the book. Later in 2009, Greenman signed with Harper Collins: the first book announced was What He's Poised To Do, an expanded paperback based on the material from Correspondences. The book was praised by Steve Almond in the Los Angeles Times. In 2010, Greenman adapted the short stories of the Russian master Anton Chekhov, updating them by replacing their characters with modern celebrities. Pop Matters, praising the collection, said \\"the very, very best of these stories make us weep.\\" Greenman's novel, The Slippage, was published by Harper Perennial in 2013. The book included a character who was a chart artist and whose work consisted of meta-charts; Greenman created a number of them and posted them at ILoveCharts.com and McSweeneys, among other places. The New York Times praised the novel as \\"fluid and commanding.\\" In the summer of 2016, Little A published Emotional Rescue, a collection of essays about pop music and relationships. Collaborations Greenman has also collaborated on celebrity memoirs. His most frequent collaborator has been Questlove; he co- wrote the hip-hop memoir Mo Meta Blues, a food-themed book called Something to Food About, a book about creativity and innovation called Creative Quest, and a conceptual cookbook called Mixtape Potluck. In addition, he wrote memoirs with the funk musician George Clinton and Brian Wilson, co-founder of the Beach Boys, as well as with the actress Mariel Hemingway, Gene Simmons of KISS, and Simon Cowell of American Idol. The Questlove and Wilson books were best-sellers. Other work Greenman's journalism and short fiction have appeared in many magazines and newspapers, including The New Yorker, where he worked as an editor from 2000 to 2014, the Paris Review, Zoetrope: All-Story. He has also moderated many events, including Literary Death Match, Literary Upstart, and the National Book Foundation's 5 Under 35 Ceremony.

History =XELA-AM= XELA-AM was founded in 1940 in Mexico City with a classical music format. For many years it was one of the few sources of classical music available to ordinary Mexican citizens. XELA was able to acquire quality sound recordings from the United States, England and France, even though it started with a very low budget, through an exchange program for Mexican music recordings. The station was acquired by Grupo Imagen in 1963. From the 1970s to the mid-1980s, the station simulcast on XELA-FM 98.5. That station was split off in the mid-1980s. The station was threatened with closure in 2000, but protests by listeners from laborers to the intelligentsia keep it open for a while longer. Their slogan was \\"Buena m√∫sica desde la Ciudad de M√©xico!\\" (\\"Good music from Mexico City!\\"). =XEITE-AM= On January 2, 2002, Imagen dropped the classical music format for sports, as \\"Estadio W 830\\" (a format now found on XEX-AM) and changed the callsign to XEITE-AM. The change resulted in protests from the station's dedicated listeners; some famous Mexican cultural luminaries, including Elena Poniatowska, Jos√© Luis Cuevas, Vicente Quirarte and V√≠ctor Hugo Rasc√≥n, formed the \\"National XELA Rescue Committee\\" (or CONAREXELA) on July 10 of that year.Anasella Acosta Nieto, Instituyen el Conarexela, bandera de la sociedad civil, La Jornada 10 July 2002 The group sought for the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio to take over the station, but IMER refused, saying it would incorporate that format into its own XHIMER-FM 94.5. In 2004, the station was sold to Grupo Radio Capital (now known as Capital Media). The Radio Capital format included news and sports programming as well as contemporary music. At 7 p.m. on February 14, 2019, Radio Capital in Mexico City ceased operations to make way for the relocation of the Qui√©reme romantic format from Grupo Siete from 1440 XEEST- AM, which shares transmission facilities with XEITE. In December 2019, the station switched to Christian programming under the name \\"Ondas de Paz\\". On February 14, 2020, Ondas de Paz moved back to 1440 and Capital resumed programming the 830 frequency.

Early life and family Potjaman was the youngest child and only daughter of Potjanee Na Pombejra and her husband Samoe Damapong, a police general who excelled in his work on crime suppression and investigation and became a Deputy Commissioner-General of the Royal Thai Police. Samoe Damapong came from a family of Lao origin; his paternal grandfather was an Isan Lao from Nong Khai while his maternal grandmother was a princess of the Na Champassak family. Potjaman and Thaksin married in July 1976, and they went on to have one son, Panthongtae, a businessman, and two daughters, Pinthongta and Paetongtarn.Baker et al (2009), p. 38-39 In the late 1970s and 1980s Potjaman worked with Thaksin to develop his various commercial ventures.Baker et al (2009), p. 40 Sale of Shin Corp On January 23, 2006, the Shinawatra family sold their entire stake in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings. The Shinawatra and Damapong families netted about 73 billion baht tax-free from the sale, using a regulation that made individuals who sell shares on the stock exchange exempt from capital gains tax. The Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the transaction and cleared the entire family from wrongdoing, except for Potjaman's son, Panthongtae. The SEC did find that Panthongtae committed minor infractions with regard to information disclosure and public tender offers in transactions between 2000 and 2002. He was fined 6 million THB (about 150,000USD). Allegations of insider trading by Potjaman, other Shinawatra family members, Shin Corporation Corp executives, and major shareholders were also investigated. No irregularities were found. On 21 September 2006, the Revenue Department sent a letter to the Shinawatras advising the Shinawatra family not to pay taxes on the transaction.

The charge was based on alleged violation of Section 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act, which specifies that government officials and their spouses are prohibited from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authorisation. However, Section 4 of the Act indicates that persons committing malfeasance must be direct supervisors of the damaged party - in this case, the FIDF.

The Court: By unanimous resolution, holding that the Fund was the administrative agency under Section 100, Subsection (1), of the National Counter Corruption Organic Act, BE 2542 (1997). By 6:3, holding that Thaksin was a de facto supervisor of the Fund. By 7:2, holding that Potjaman was not a holder of political position or public authority prohibited under Section 122 of the Organic Act. And by unanimous resolution, holding that the purchased land and all other properties gained in this case could not be seized under Section 33, Subsection 1 and Subsection 2 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, Thaksin was found guilty of abusing his power to help his wife purchasing the land at a knock-down price, being sentenced to two years in imprisonment.

The crew were seen sitting on the ship's hull, but the storm prevented rescue boats from reaching the scene and it was too dangerous to lower the helicopter crew onto the violently pitching hull. All but two of the men were eventually rescued after jumping into the sea once the ship had capsized. One of the Filipino crew members died in the hospital after his rescue suit failed and a Swede drowned after being entangled in the wreck. The master of the ship broke several bones after falling, but survived.

Professor Ophir teaches philosophy at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University. He is also a fellow at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute where he directs an interdisciplinary research project on \\"Humanitarian Action in Catastrophes: The Shaping of Contemporary Political Imagination and Moral Sensibilities.\\" Ophir's recent book The Order of Evils offers a moral theory that emphasizes the socially structured existential and political nature of evil. He argues that evils, like pain, suffering, loss, and humiliation, are \\"superfluous evils\\" that can often be prevented but are not. Analyzing seminal works by modern and postmodern philosophers such as Rousseau, Kant, Marx, Sartre, Arendt, Foucault, and Derrida, Ophir submits that to be moral is to care for others, and to be committed to preventing their suffering and distress. Ophir's focus on understanding particular evils (rather than some transcendentalized Evil) keeps his thought determinedly secular. While a deeply theoretical work, The Order of Evils is informed by Ophir's preoccupation with two major events in recent Jewish history: the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel. He does not compare these two events but instead introduces a typology of disasters that locates them within the wide spectrum of calamities generated by humans to exhibit both the specificities and general patterns that subsequently emerge.

It was ruled by Britain from its initial capture in 1708 until 1756, then occupied by France for seven years until the Peace of Paris (1763) when it was returned to Britain.

Roseland started operation in 1925 under its founder and original owner, William Muar. It continued to operate for 60 years until its closure on Labor Day September 2, 1985.  History  Roseland originally opened up under the name \\"Lakeside Park\\" with little more than a dance hall and a few rides. The dance hall itself was named \\"Roseland\\" after the Roseland Ballroom in New York City. After three years it had become such an integral component to the park's identity, that the park itself was renamed from Lakeside to Roseland. Over the years as the park changed and grew, it saw many rides come and go. Some of the additional attractions saw things like a Ferris wheel, bumper cars, a miniature train ride, a sky ride that went out over part of Canandaigua Lake before returning to the station, and the park's Carousel, which was purchased for the park in 1941 from the defunct Long Branch amusement park. For a period of time there was even a live circus act. Additional attractions have been added and changed over the years, including the addition of the park's major wooden roller coaster, the Skyliner, which was built in 1960. Park Rides The following is a partial list of attractions Roseland had at various points throughout its history. {border=0 cellspacing=6 cellpadding=6  *Skyliner *Carousel *Kiddie Coaster(s) *Ferris Wheel *Gold Nugget (ride through spooky-house) *Flying Scooters *Flying Bobs  *Antique Cars *Yo-Yo *Bumper boats *Scrambler  *Sky Ride *The Round Up *The Golden Nugget (a Haunted house) *The Whip *Miniature golf  *Teacups *Tilt a Whirl *Flying Jet *Flying Bobs *Wild Mouse *Live Circus Act }  Post-Closure  On September 16, two weeks following the park closure, an auction was held to sell off all of the park's remains. While almost nothing of the site that Roseland once occupied remains today, two of the park's most notable rides can still be found in operation. Philadelphia Toboggan Company's carousel No. 18, was purchased at the auction for $397,500 by the Pyramid Companies of Syracuse. It was refurbished and restored to its original colors, and then installed at the Carousel Center mall in Syracuse, New York on October 15, 1990. Carousel No. 18 was originally built in 1909. The other ride still in operation is the Skyliner, a wooden roller coaster. This ride was also built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. It was built at Roseland and opened in 1960, where it operated until the park closure in 1985. It was then moved to Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania reopening in 1987 under the same name. It was designed by John C. Allen who later went on to design the Blue Streak at Cedar Point. It is a double out and back coaster with a track length of 2400 feet, and a maximum height of 60 feet. A housing development now sits on the property where Roseland Park once was. Though the park has long since shut down, its name still exists today in the form of Roseland Waterpark, which is also located in Canandaigua. References External links * *Palmer, Richard F.

The station is home to former WAAM morning host Lucy Ann Lance and airs nationally syndicated programs from Bloomberg Radio and Westwood One. Top of the hour news updates are provided by Westwood One. WLBY is owned by Cumulus Media. History 1290 on the AM dial has had quite a varied history since it first signed on in 1958 as WOIA. In 1962, WOIA jumped to the FM dial (102.9) and the AM signal was re-dubbed WOIB. (For more on the FM station, see WWWW-FM.) After several years as a MOR outlet, WOIA/WOIB began to simulcast a Top 40 format in 1967. On February 14, 1970, both stations were re-branded as \\"The Winners\\", with the 1290 calls changed to WNRS. Initially the \\"Winners\\" retained the WOIA/WOIB Top 40 format but later switched to country; WNRZ-FM also played progressive rock for a time while the AM side continued with the country format. In 1975, WNRZ-FM brought the \\"Winners\\" simulcast to an end when it changed to album oriented rock as WIQB. WNRS continued on with country and later a fairly successful oldies format under the moniker \\"Ann Arbor's Solid Gold.\\" This continued until 1992, when the oldies format moved to new sister station WAMX-FM 107.1 as WQKL (or \\"Kool 107\\"). AM 1290 picked up WAMX's New Age/Adult Contemporary format and later the WAMX calls, after briefly using the call letters WIQB. In early 1999, Tom Monaghan bought the station and changed it to an all-Catholic format and changed the calls to WDEO. Later that year, the religious programs (and the WDEO calls) were shifted to the former WWCM at 990 AM, and 1290 changed formats again. Now, under new owners Cumulus, it was \\"WYBN, Your Business News\\". In May 2000, Clear Channel Communications acquired Cumulus' Ann Arbor stations, including WYBN. The following year, Clear Channel switched it to WCAS, with an adult standards format dubbed \\"American Music Classics.\\" In July 2002, 1290 saw the revival of \\"Honey Radio\\", an all-oldies format that was popular on the former WHND (now WRDT) in the 1980s and 90s; now the calls were WHNE (also the calls of WHND's old FM outlet in the 1970s, now WCSX). \\"Honey Radio\\" took the \\"Real Oldies\\" approach that Clear Channel tried at WSAI Cincinnati, WRLL Chicago and several other AM stations, playing mostly 1950s and 1960s hits with very limited post-1970 material. The format was AM 1290's most successful in some time, but lasted only about two years, until August 2004, when WHNE became WLBY ‚Äî the tenth callsign the station has used, and the longest-lived (13 years as of 2017). In December 2006, Cumulus reacquired Clear Channel's Ann Arbor stations, including WLBY, as part of a multi-station swap. Cumulus' future plans for WLBY remain unknown, although Cumulus has said it does not plan to change the formats of any of its Ann Arbor stations. On March 16, 2009, WLBY switched to a business talk radio format, abandoning the progressive talk format that included the bankrupt Air America Radio network.http://ltradio.blogspot.com/2009/03/wlbyann-arbor-goes- business.htmlhttp://www.mlive.com/entertainment/ann- arbor/index.ssf/2009/03/ann_arbors_wlby_to_switch_to_p.html In the following years, WLBY has added new programs to feature more news-talk programming. Weekday programs now include the local Lucy Ann Lance Show, Westwood One programming from Noon to Midnight, and Bloomberg Radio business shows for the remaining nine hours each weekday. Weekends consist primarily of the Bloomberg Radio feed.

Pitseolak was Baffin Island's first indigenous photographer. Life \\"In Peter Pitseolak's Home\\" Pitseolak was born September 2, 1902 on Nottingham Island, Northwest Territories. He lived most of his life in traditional Inuit camps near Cape Dorset, on the southwest coast of Baffin Island, now in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. IN the face of rapid technological change in the Inuit community, Pitseolak dedicated himself to preserving knowledge of the traditional ways of living, by writing, sketching, and especially photography. He documented customs, hunting techniques, stories and myths. His brother was Pootoogoo, a chief. In 1912 Pitseolak met photographer Robert J. Flaherty. Flaherty, best known today for his documentary movie Nanook of the North (1922), inspired Pitseolak's interest in photography.http://iaq.inuitartfoundation.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/09/15.3.pdf It was not until the 1930s, however, that Pitseolak took his first recorded photograph. This was for a white visitor who was afraid to approach a polar bear for a shot. Pitseolak took the photo for him, using the visitor's camera. In 1923 Pitseolak was married to Annie from Lake Harbour, now Kimmirut. Seven children resulted from their marriage; only Udluriak and Kooyoo, two daughters, survived. Annie was sticken with tuberculosis in 1939 and died. In the 1940s Pitseolak was living in Cape Dorset working for fur-traders when he acquired his first camera, from a Catholic missionary. With the help of his second wife Aggeok (1906-1977), he developed his first photographs in a hunting igloo. Many difficulties had to be overcome, including extreme climate changes, high light levels from the reflective snowscape, and the difficulty of obtaining film and developer. Peter and Aggeok experimented. They used a battery-powered flashlight covered with red cloth as a safelight, and a lens filter made from old sunglasses. He was also a painter, executing a series of watercolors in 1939 for John Buchan, later 2nd Baron Tweedsmuir, son of Governor General John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir. Pitseolak wrote various diaries, notes and manuscripts, all in Inuktitut syllabics. Along with Dorothy Harley Eber, he published People From Our Side (1975), the story of his early life, and Peter Pitseolak's Escape From Death (1977), an account of a near disaster among the ice floes. He photographed himself, his family, and community members in candid shots. He also posed them with traditional clothing and implements. Over twenty years, Pitseolak made more than 2,000 photographs of the disappearing traditional way of life. In 1961, at the age of 59, he left his camp at Keatuk and returned to settlement life at Cape Dorset. After his death in 1973, more than 1,500 negatives and photographs were purchased from his widow for the National museums of Canada (now part of Canadian Museum of History). The famed sculptor Okpik Pitseolak (b. 1946) married Peter's son Mark Pitseolak.Pitseolak, Okpik , Inuit Art FOundation. Accessed 13 January 2013. According to Terry Ryan, former manager of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative, Peter Pitseolak's nephew, Kananginak Pootoogook, greatly admired and was influenced by his uncle and also became an artist. He died September 30, 1973 in Cape Dorset, Northwest Territories.

By AFSPC order the unit inactivated 24 May 2007. Its mission and members moved to the Combat Operations Division of the 614th Air and Space Operations Center (614 AOC). The inactivation was part of the larger USAF plan to implement the Numbered Air Force-Component structure. The unit's members became the plankholders of the 614th Air and Space Operations Center and the Joint Space Operations Center.  Mission  The 614th Space Operations Squadron mission was to provide Air Force Space Command's Fourteenth Air Force Commander (14 AF/CC (AFSTRAT-SP)) and US Strategic Command‚Äôs Commander, Joint Functional Component Command for Space (CDR JFCC SPACE) with the space operations expertise to command and control space forces in continuous support of global and theater operations. Representing the 14 AF/CC (AFSTRAT-SP) and CDR JFCC SPACE, the 614 SOPS delivered Air Force space force capabilities to users around the globe, 24-hours a day.  History  The last official photo of the 614 SOPS (18 May 2007) The 614 SOPS was first constituted as the 614th Space Operations Flight (SOPF) in April 1996 with thirty-seven assigned members. Initially housed in two temporary facilities, the 614 SOPF christened a new Space Operations Center (SOC) in November 1997. The SOC was redesignated the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) in July 1999 under the command of Major General Robert Hinson (USAF official biography). With the support Headquarters Air Force Space Command, the JSpOC manpower grew to over 100 positions. With the May 2005 ribbon-cutting of the new JSpOC, along with the stand up of the 614th Space Intelligence Squadron and 614th Space Communications Squadron, as well as the alignment of the 1st Space Control Squadron under the 614th Space Operations Group, and augmentation of the 9th Space Operations Squadron (Air Force Reserve) in every joint mission area, the 614 SOPS transitioned from the sole force provider to one of several force providers to the JSpOC. With the January 2005 stand-up of the 614th Space Communications Squadron, the four Satellite Communication (SATCOM) Support Centers located at Peterson AFB, Colorado; MacDill AFB, Florida; Stuttgart, Germany; and Wahiawa, Hawaii transferred from 614 SOPS administrative control. These operating locations and their twenty-five communications NCOs had been under 614 SOPS control since October 1999. A combination of the realignment of the Numbered Air Force components with the implementation of Program Action Directive 06-09 (Nov 2006), the redesignation of the 614th Space Operations Group to the 614th Air and Space Operations Center, and the signature of an AFSPC special order, the squadron of inactivated on 24 May 2007. A ceremony celebrating their past and look toward the future was conducted by Maj Gen William L. Shelton on 18 Jun 2007 in front of the HQ 14 AF.  Honors  Members assigned to the 614 SOPS have a distinguished history earning many awards, including the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award in 1998; Air Force Outstanding Unit for 2005, 2006 and 2007; and Air Force Association Citation of Honor for 2006. As a force provider to the Joint Space Operations Center, the squadron also shared in the honors as the 2005 and 2007 winner of USSTRATCOM's Omaha Trophy for the Best Space and Information Operations Unit. Air Force Outstanding Unit Award Image:Outstanding Unit ribbon.svg Air Force Organizational Excellence Award Image:Organizational Excellence ribbon.svg  Emblem  The 614 SOPS patch primary colors were black and gold. Black signifies dignity and determination and gold represents excellence, honor, and high values: the qualities and spirit of the 614 SOPS. The tiger eyes represent the mission for assessing the status of the 14 Air Force space forces. The globe, with the overseas landmasses, symbolizes the squadron‚Äôs worldwide mission. Additionally, the Air Force star shows our tie to the original Army Air Corps. The parabolic arch encircling the globe denotes command and control of space forces operating weapons systems traversing through space.

An October 10 poll by R.T. Strategies showed Judy Feder to be within 5% at 42% to Wolf's 47%. Late in the campaign, the DCCC added Va-10 to their target list due to Feder's strong campaign and prodigious fund-raising, bringing in a total of $1.6 million. The DCCC also sent her a late contribution of $75,000.00. Ultimately, Feder lost to Wolf, 57.25%-40.89%, but gave him the closest challenge he had faced in 24 years (with the obvious exceptions of the 1982 and 1986 campaigns). The 10th district is notorious as a difficult district for challengers due to its reliance upon the expensive Washington, D.C. media market.

The genus comprises 34 species, which are found in Africa and Asia.. www.reptile- database.org. Psammophis are diurnal and prey on lizards and rodents which they actively hunt. All species in the genus are venomous, and the venom is considered mild and not dangerous to humans.Bates MF, Branch WR, Bauer AM, Burger M, Marais J, Alexander GJ, De Villiers MS. (editors) (2014). Atlas and Red List of the Reptiles of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Suricata 1. South African National Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria. Etymology The generic name Psammophis was coined by the Austrian herpetologist Leopold Fitzinger in 1826, a compound of the Hellenistic Greek œàŒ±ŒºŒºŒø, \\"sand\\" + Classical Greek ·ΩÑœïŒπœÇ, \\"snake\\", thus sand-snake.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, s.v. Description In the genus Psammophis the maxillary teeth are 10 to 13 in number, with one or two in the middle much enlarged and fang-like, preceded and followed by an interspace; the two posterior teeth are grooved. The anterior mandibular teeth are long, and the posterior teeth are small. The head is elongated and distinct from the neck, with an angular canthus rostralis. The eye is rather large, with a round pupil. The body is elongated and cylindrical with smooth dorsal scales in 15 or 17 rows at midbody, with apical pits. The ventral scales are rounded or obtusely angulate laterally, and the tail is long with the subcaudals in two rows. Geographic range Thirty-four species of Psammophis are known, from Africa and southern Asia. Behavior Psammophis species are chiefly sand-snakes, but they are also found on low bushes.

The case stood for the proposition that a representation made by one party cannot become a term of a contract if made after the agreement was made. The representation can only be binding where it was made at the time the contract was formed. Facts Mrs Olley was a long staying resident of the Marlborough Court Hotel, [Lancaster Gate], London. As usual she left her room key on a rack behind the reception one day, but when she came back it was gone. Inside her room, her fur coat had been stolen. (A witness called Colonel Crerer, who was sitting in the lounge, saw a person go in and come out again with a parcel fifteen minutes later.) The porter had apparently been cleaning a bust of the Duke of Marlborough and failed to notice. Mrs Olley asked to be repaid for the cost of the coat. The hotel pointed to an exclusion clause on a notice behind a door in the bedroom leading to a washbasin, which said, Mrs Olley argued that the clause was not incorporated into the contract. Judgment Denning LJ, Singleton LJ and Bucknill LJ found, firstly, that the hotel had failed to take reasonable care as they were required to do contractually and under Innkeepers' Liability Act 1863 s 1. Secondly, the disclaimer was not part of the contract and the hotel could not rely upon it. The contract for the storage of the coat was formed at the reception desk. There was no way that Mrs Olley could have been aware of the disclaimer at that point and so it could not be part of the contract.

Schulze attempted to refute the principles that Karl Leonhard Reinhold established in support of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781). The title is a reference to Aenesidemus, an ancient Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher. Its complete title, in English translation, was Aenesidemus or Concerning the Foundations of the Philosophy of the Elements Issued by Professor Reinhold in Jena Together with a Defense of Skepticism against the Pretensions of the Critique of Reason (). Summary The book was supposed to be a written correspondence between Hermias (Greek: \\"a follower of Hermes\\"), who believes in the Kantian critical philosophy, and Aenesidemus (Greek: \\"he who praises the people\\"), who is skeptical about that philosophy. The skepticism of David Hume's skepticism about induction, according to this book, was not disproved by Kant. As Hume had asserted, the existence of causality, the soul, or the thing-in-itself cannot be proved. Schulze's skepticism Philosophy cannot establish the existence or non-existence of the thing-in-itself. By establishing general principles, we can't know the limits of our ability to know. Progressive development, however, can approach complete knowledge.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol. 7, New York: Macmillan, 1972 No skeptic can doubt the reality and certainty of mental representations and mental events that are immediately given through consciousness. Skepticism does not claim that metaphysical questions cannot be answered. Skepticism doubts the possibility of knowledge about the existence or non-existence of the thing-in-itself. Kant, however, was guilty of begging the question in that he presupposed that the thing-in-itself exists and causally interacts with observing subjects. Kant and Reinhold claimed that the reality of objects can be known from the representations in the mind of the observing subject. This is inferring objective reality from subjective thought. Such an inference is the fallacy of drawing existential conclusions from logical premises. Kant's critical philosophy is self-contradictory. He said that things-in-themselves cause sensations in an observer's mind. Kant applied causality to noumena. But, in his critique, he had claimed that causality is a category of the understanding that can only be applied to phenomena. Kant posited real existence to the postulates of God, Free Will, and Immortal Souls. But this is more than is necessary for moral theology, which only requires belief in them as Ideas of Reason. The science of psychology does not require that the soul have faculties. Rather, psychology is a detailed description and systematic classification of actual mental events.Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, 1996, If we were to take critical philosophy seriously, we would commit ourselves to resolving experiences into two parts -- a system of universal subjective forms on one side, and a mass of amorphous, meaningless objective matter on the other.Between Kant and Hegel, trans. and ed. George Di Giovanni and H. S. Harris, Indianapolis, Hackett, 2000, How can we be sure that Kant's obligation to be moral is the result of freedom? It might be the result of some irrational natural force. Reactions Kant's response was indicated in his letter to Jakob Sigismund Beck, December 4, 1792: :\\"Under the assumed name of Aenesidemus, an even wider skepticism has been advanced, namely, that we cannot know at all whether our representations correspond to anything else (as object), which is as much as to say: whether a representation is a representation (stands for anything). For 'representation' means a determination in us that we relate to something else (whose place the representation takes in us)...\\"Di Giovanni and Harris 2000, p. 25 Reinhold wrote that true skepticism rested on the fact that only the observing subject felt what was in its consciousness. The only truth is the subject's notion that there is an object that agrees with its internal mental representation. Johann Fichte agreed with Reinhold's subjectivity. He based his own idealism on the observing subject's internal forms of knowledge. Arthur Schopenhauer agreed with Schulze: [\\"Therefore the world as [REPRESENTATION], in which aspect alone we are here considering it, has two essential, necessary, and inseparable halves. The one half is the object, whose forms are space and time, and through these plurality. But the other half, the subject, does not lie in space and time, for it is whole and undivided in every representing being. Hence a single one of these beings with the object completes the world as representation just as fully as do the millions that exist. And if that single one were to disappear, then the world as representation would no longer exist. Therefore these halves are inseparable even in thought, for each of the two has meaning and existence only through and for the other; each exists with the other and vanishes with it.\\"].The World as Will and Representation, Volume I, Book 2 References External links * Influence of Schulze's Aenesidemus on Fichte and Schopenhauer Category:1792 non-fiction books Category:Books about Immanuel Kant Category:Skepticism Category:Epistemology literature Category:Pyrrhonism ","title":"Aenesidemus (book)"},{"id":"7730229","text":"√âb√©niste () is a loanword (from French) for a cabinet-maker, particularly one who works in ebony. Etymology and ambiguities As opposed to √©b√©niste, the term menuisier denotes a woodcarver or chairmaker in French. The English equivalent for √©b√©niste, \\"ebonist\\", is not commonly used. Originally, an √©b√©niste was one who worked with ebony, a favoured luxury wood for mid-17th century Parisian cabinets, originating in imitation of elite furniture being made in Antwerp. The word is 17th century in origin. Early Parisian √©b√©nistes often came from the Low Countries themselves; an outstanding example is Pierre Golle, who worked at the Gobelins manufactory making cabinets and table tops veneered with marquetry, the traditional enrichment of √©b√©nisterie, or \\"cabinet-work\\". History √âb√©nistes make case furniture, either veneered or painted. Under Parisian guild regulations the application of painted varnishes, generically called vernis Martin, took place in separate workshops - sawdust being an enemy to freshly varnished surfaces. During the French Revolution the guilds in Paris and elsewhere were abolished (1791), and with them went all their regulations. As one result of this, Parisian chairmakers were able to produce veneered chairs - just as London furniture-makers, less stringently ruled, had been able to make since the production of the first chairs with splats shortly before 1720, in imitation of Chinese chairs. Because of this amalgamation of trades, makers of chairs and of other seat furniture began to use veneering techniques, formerly the guarded privilege of √©b√©nistes. This privilege became less distinct after the relaxation of guild rules of the Ancien R√©gime, and after the French Revolution's abolition of guilds in 1791. Seat furniture in the Empire style was often veneered with mahogany, and later in pale woods also. From the mid-19th century onward, the two French trades, √©b√©niste and menuisier, often combined under the single roof of a \\"furnisher\\", and the craft began to make way for the industry. From the mid-17th century through the 18th century, a notable number of √©b√©nistes of German and Low Countries extraction were pre-eminent among Parisian furniture-makers, as the abbreviated list below suggests.

In Borsh, the Lab dialect of Albanian is spoken. Borsh borders with Fterra, Qeparo, Piqeras, Ku√ß, √áorraj, Kalasa, Zhulat, Tatzat, and has a population of 2500 registered inhabitants. History Drawing of the Sopot fortress during capture by Venetian ships in 1570 The region which Borshi is located was part of the Chaonia of the ancient region of Epirus. Borshi was probably fortified from antiquity and it belonged to Kemara (modern Himara) then part of the Chaonian tribal state, one of the main Greek tribes in Epirus. The castle remained in use in Roman times and was refortified by the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century. Nothing is known of the settlement in the Byzantine era, until it is mentioned as Sopotos in 1258 when it was part of the Despotate of Epirus tha grew out of the failing Byzantine empire. Borsh then went through a period of considerable turmoil, changing hands several times between the Despotate of Epirus and Norman crusades invaders before being taken by the Turks in 1431. Fifty years later it was captured by Albanians led by Skenderbeg, but was retaken by the Turks only eleven years later and heavily refortified. On June 10, 1570 the castle of Sopot was taken by James Celsi, Proveditor of the Venetian navy, who left after leaving in charge the Greek commander of Nauplion, Emmanuel Mormoris. This also triggered part of the nearby Himariotes to submit to Venetian rule. The next year the Ottoman army recaptured it and took Mormori as a prisoner. The 18th century was a turbulent economic time and due to Orthodox revolts and conflicts with Orthodox powers such as the Russian Empire, Ottoman governors at times applied pressures including drastic tax raises on the local Christian population as well as other pressures caused towns to convert.Giakoumis, Kosta (2010).‚ÄúThe Orthodox Church in Albania During the Ottoman Rule (15th-19th century)‚Äù, in Rathberger A. [ed.] (2010), Religion und Kultur im albanisch- sprachigen S√ºdosteuropa, preface by O. Schmitt, Frankfurt am Main: Pro Oriente ‚Äì Peter Lang, pp. 69-110. Pages 75-77. Borsh converted in 1744 and followed it up by raiding nearby Piqeras, which remained Christian.* Ruined mosque of Hajji Bendo in Borsh The fortress was renovated again by Ali Pasha Tepelena, and it is these fortifications that visitors can view by taking the half-hour walk up to the ‚Äòcastle rock‚Äô the limestone mount clearly visible above the old village. During Ali pasha‚Äôs reign there were 700 houses at Borsh, and below the castle mount you can see a ruined mosque of Hajji Bendo and madrese (a Muslim theological school), both of which were damaged in Ali Pasha‚Äôs wars but survived, only to be destroyed by fighting after 1912 when the Turks left the region. Between 1912 and 1914 serious inter-ethnic conflict took place between Greeks and Albanians, and significant portion of the old village was destroyed, however some fine buildings remain. Modern Borsh was built after that, but became seriously depopulated, first due to malaria, and following severe reprisal killings by Germans in WW2 however, depopulation was balanced by an influx of refugees from Vlora, fleeing into partisan territory from the city which was heavily contested until late in the war. Tourism alt= Albanian Riviera at Borsh The village is very stable and growing in prosperity thanks to tourism and olive oil production. The thing that makes Borsh very popular is its beach, which is the largest beach in Ionian sea (7 km). The tourism has begun to develop a lot thanks to village's beauty and thanks to its friendly people. Continuing in this way Borsh will become soon the best destination for tourists in the South of Albania. Dialect The Lab dialect spoken in Borsh was reported by Albanian linguist M Totoni to possess nasal vowels,Totoni, Menela (1964). ‚ÄúE folmja e bregdetit t√´ posht√´m‚Äù, Studime Filologjike I, Tiran√´, 1964, p. 136. a characteristic that was previously thought to have been the diagnostic difference between the major Tosk and Gheg divisions, whereby Tosk dialects such as Borsh's lab dialect were previously thought to have all lost nasal vowels when they split from Gheg dialects, which retained the nasality feature.Pa√ßarizi , Rrahman (2008).

It stands not far from the manor house, Cotheridge Court. The church boasts an ancient, wooden tower. The main part of the church, the nave, has a plastered ceiling with its beams remaining hidden though some ceiling beams in the chancel are visible. The chancel floor is partially tiled. The church belongs to the Diocese of Worcester with its denomination being Church of England, and small services are still held. It lies upon the pilgrimage route to Wales from Worcester, and is today a visitors centre. History East Window, St. Leonard's, Cotheridge. =Chancel and nave= The oldest parts of the church are the chancel and the nave which contains a carved, stone Norman Arch dividing them. These date to the early part of the 12th century during the reign of Henry I. The walls of the chancel and the nave are probably sandstone, but they are plastered on both sides. The windows in the nave are also 12th century. The ceiling of the nave is plastered, and is curved with no beams showing. =Bell tower= During the 15th century the wooden, bell tower was added. It is square, ascends in four stages and is built of chestnut and oak. The studded, oak doorway to the tower also provides access to the church. =Pulpit= Dating from the 17th century it is oak-panelled and is hexagonal in shape. =Floor tiles= In the chancel the floor is made of reddish tiles. Four of them bear the arms of Gloucester Abbey, three of them with the Elephant Head of Throckmorton, two carry the Berkeley arms, and one a Passion Shield inscribed in Latin. =Ownership= Since 1570 the ownership has followed the descent of the manor house, Cotheridge Court, and in 1623 John Acton sold the church to William Berkeley, who had previously purchased the manor from Acton in 1615. =Restoration= In 1684 it received restoration from Rowland Berkeley and between 1615 and 1939 it has been cared for by the Berkeley family. It is now a part of the Diocese of Worcester. Collapsed roof In November, 1947 the nave roof collapsed. Though there were only about 200 people in the parish they decided to save their church. After 13 years the restoration work was completed but it was considered unsafe to leave the four bells in the bell tower, and to this day only one remains. Once again, in April 1979 the nave roof was considered unsafe with the possibility of collapsing. The people of Cotheridge and their neighbouring parishes raised money for the restoration.

Set primarily in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City in the 1920s, the story centers on the reunion of two childhood friends‚ÄîClare Kendry and Irene Redfield‚Äîand their increasing fascination with each other's lives. The title refers to the practice of \\"racial passing\\", and is a key element of the novel; Clare Kendry's attempt to pass as white for her husband, John (Jack) Bellew, is its most significant depiction in the novel, and a catalyst for the tragic events. Larsen's exploration of race was informed by her own mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality, and is the subject of considerable scholarly criticism. As one of only two novels that Larsen wrote, Passing has been significant in placing its author at the forefront of several literary canons. Background =Biographical context= As early as 1925, Nella Larsen had decided that she wanted to be among the \\"New Negro\\" writers receiving considerable attention at the time. Initially writing short stories that were sold early in 1926 to a ladies magazine, she was rumored that year to be writing a novel. In a letter to her friend, Carl Van Vechten, she acknowledges, \\"it is the awful Truth. But, who knows if I'll get through with the damned thing. Certainly not I.\\"Letter to Carl Van Vechten, July 1, 1926, James Wheldon Johnson Collection. (Reprinted from Larson, Nella (2007). Carla Kaplan, ed. Passing. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, p. 85. .) In April 1927, Larsen and her husband, Elmer Imes, moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Harlem to be closer to the cultural phenomenon. The following year, Larsen published her first novel Quicksand with New York-based publisher Knopf, and its favorable critical reception encouraged her ambitions to become known as a novelist. =Historical context= The 1920s in the United States was a period marked by considerable anxiety and discussion over the crossing of racial boundaries, the so-called \\"color line\\" between blacks and whites. This anxiety was exacerbated by the Great Migration, in which hundreds of thousands of blacks left the rural south for northern and midwestern cities, where, together with new waves of immigrants, they changed the social makeup. The practice of persons \\"crossing the color line\\"‚Äîattempting to claim recognition in another racial group than the one they were believed to belong to‚Äîwas known as \\"passing\\". As many African Americans had European ancestry in varying proportions, some appeared visibly European. (Reprinted from ) The legacy of slavery, with its creation of a racial caste, and the imposition in the 17th century of the so-called one-drop rule (by which someone with even one ancestor of sub-Saharan-African origin was considered black) led to a hardening of racial lines that had historically been more fluid; at any time, the concept of race was \\"historically contingent.\\" Although the exact numbers of people who passed is, for obvious reasons, not known, many estimates were made at the time. The sociologist Charles S. Johnson (1893‚Äì1956) calculated that 355,000 blacks had passed between 1900 and 1920. (Quoted by ) A significant precedent for Larsen's depiction of Clare and Jack's relationship was the 1925 legal trial known as the \\"Rhinelander Case\\" (or Rhinelander v. Rhinelander). On the urging of his family, Leonard Kip Rhinelander, a wealthy white man, sued his wife, Alice Beatrice Jones, for annulment and fraud; he alleged that she had failed to inform him of her \\"colored\\" blood. The case concerned not only race but also status and class, as he had met her when she was working as a domestic. Although the jury eventually returned a verdict for Alice (she contended that her mixed race was obvious, and she had never denied it), it came at a devastating social cost for both parties; intimate exchanges between the couple were read out in court, and Alice was forced to partially disrobe in front of the jury in the judge's chambers in order for them to assess the darkness of her skin. Larsen refers to the case near the end of the novel, when Irene wonders about the consequences of Jack discovering Clare's racial status: \\"What if Bellew should divorce Clare? Could he? There was the Rhinelander case.\\" The case received substantial coverage in the press of the time, and Larsen could assume that it was common knowledge to her readers. Plot The Drake Hotel in Chicago, on which the \\"Drayton Hotel\\" in Passing is principally modeled. The story is written as a third person narrative from the perspective of Irene Redfield, a mixed-race woman who lives in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. Part One of the book, titled \\"Encounter,\\" opens with Irene receiving a letter from Clare Kendry, causing her to recall a chance encounter she had had with her, at the roof restaurant of the Drayton Hotel in Chicago, during a brief stay in the city. Irene does not answer Clare's attempts to reconnect written in the letters.The women grew up together but lost touch when Clare's mixed-race father died and she was taken to live with her two paternal white aunts. Irene learns that Clare \\"passes\\" for white, living primarily in Europe with her unsuspecting, rich, white husband and their daughter. Although Irene tries to avoid further engagement with Clare, she never is able to fully exclude her from her life as she later visits Clare for tea along with another childhood friend, Gertrude Martin. Toward the end of the visit, Clare's white husband John (Jack) Bellew arrives. Unaware that all three women are mulatta, Jack expresses some very racist views and makes the women uneasy. However, the women play along in an effort to maintain Clare's secret identity. Afterward, Irene and Gertrude decide that Clare's situation is too dangerous for them to continue associating with her and are uncomfortable around Clare and her husband. Irene receives a letter of apology from Clare but destroys it in her quest to try and forget about Clare and get her out of her life. Instead Irene wants to focus on her life with her husband, Brian, and her two sons, Theodore and Brian Jr. Part Two of the book, \\"Re-encounter,\\" returns to the present, with Irene having received the new letter from Clare. After Irene ignores Clare's letter, Clare visits in person so Irene reluctantly agrees to see her. When it is brought up that Irene serves on the committee for the \\"Negro Welfare League\\" (NWL) Clare invites herself to their upcoming dance despite Irene's advice against it for fear that Jack will find out. Clare attends the dance and enjoys herself without her husband finding out, which encourages her to continue spending time in Harlem. Irene and Clare resume their childhood companionship, and Clare frequently visits Irene's home. The third and final part of the novel begins before Christmas, as Irene's relationship with her husband has become increasingly fraught. Aware of her friend's appeal, Irene becomes convinced that her husband is having an affair with Clare. During a shopping trip with her visibly black friend Felise Freeland, Irene encounters Jack, who becomes aware of her and, by extension, Clare's, racial status. Irene considers warning Clare about Jack's new-found knowledge but decides against it, worried that the pair's divorce might encourage her husband to leave her for Clare. Later, Clare accompanies Irene and Brian to a party hosted by Felise. The gathering is interrupted by Jack, who accuses Clare of being a \\"damned dirty nigger!\\" Irene rushes to Clare, who is standing by an open window. Suddenly, Clare falls out of the window from the top floor of the building to the ground below, where she is pronounced dead by the guests who eventually gather at the site. Whether she has fallen accidentally, was pushed by either Irene or Bellew, or committed suicide, is unclear. The book ends with Irene's fragmented anguish at Clare's death. Themes =Race and \\"tragic mulatto\\"= Passing has been described as \\"the tragic story of a beautiful light-skinned mulatto passing for white in high society.\\" The tragic mulatto (also \\"mulatta\\" when referring to a woman) is a stock character in early African-American literature. Such accounts often featured the light- skinned offspring of a white slaveholder and his black slave, whose mixed heritage in a race-based society means that she is unable to identify or find a place with either blacks or whites. The resulting feeling of exclusion was portrayed as variably manifested in self-loathing, depression, alcoholism, sexual perversion, and attempts at suicide. On the surface, Passing conforms to that stereotype in its portrayal of Clare Kendry, whose passing for white has tragic consequences; however, the book resists the conventions of the genre, as Clare refuses to feel the expected anguish at the betrayal of her black identity and socializes with blacks for the purposes of excitement rather than racial solidarity. Scholars have more generally considered Passing as a novel in which the major concern is not race. For instance, Claudia Tate describes the issue as \\"merely a mechanism for setting the story in motion, sustaining the suspense, and bringing about the external circumstances for the story's conclusion.\\" Catherine Rottenberg argues that Larsen's novella is a prime example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their struggle with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African- American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation. = Class = As scholars show, race is not the only primary concern in Nella Larsen's \\"Passing\\". Class is also a major aspect that is simultaneously developed. Both of the main characters Irene Redfield and Clare Kendry present a strong sense of class. They also demonstrate how they cross clearly defined class borders in order to obtain more power in their life.  Zulena  Scholarly critics such as Mary Wilson have examined the character of Irene's maid Zulena, who demonstrates the middle-class African- American family in the 1920s. Irene opposed the idea of discrimination and racism towards the blacks but when it came to maintaining her social class she preferred the domesticity and servitude even if it was from the people from her own black race. Domesticity in the South was often associated with the black woman but Irene's decides to maintain the power and class through servitude of another black woman. Wilson examines that the differences in class was not just embedded in the black versus white society but also within the single black race. Such difference can be seen as a conflict between Irene's ideology and her actions when it comes to maintaining her status as a middle-class African-American. The class privilege is well defined through the skin color as Zulena is described as a \\"mahogany-coloured creature\\" which meant that she had no chance to pass like Irene as white and it automatically decides the role for the black colored woman to serve as a maid and belong to the inferior class. Although, Irene calls herself black but having an ability to pass as white makes her behave like white privileged woman because she happily accepts the servitude complicating the issue of race and class. Larsen introduces Zulena in the story as a \\"colored creature\\", primarily from Irene's perspective which depicts that Irene's considers her servant from an inferior class and therefore decides to keep a certain distance from her maid.  Clare Kendry  Clare Kendry crosses social class binaries. Clare does not inhabit any particular social class but rather lives as both a working-class and a middle-class woman in the novel. Clare is born in a working-class family where her father is a janitor of the building that she lives in. In adulthood, she passes during her marriage to obtain the lifestyle of an upper-middle- class woman. Despite having the luxury and comfort that she has always wanted but never had had in her childhood, Clare still longs for her childhood experiences and constantly visits Irene and her maid Zulena. Because Clare shares many experiences of the working-class, she feels very comfortable when talking to Zulena as if Zulena was her friend. Clare's desire to live in both social classes at the same time shows how these class boundaries are fluid.  Irene Redfield  While Clare demonstrates her class binaries, Irene is very protective towards her own status quo. Irene grew up as a middle-class person and continues to live as such after marrying a doctor. Irene is more hesitant to cross between middle-class and working-class; she isolates herself and avoids all of the circumstances that she might be mistaken for a lower- class person. For example, during Irene's attempt to pass to become an elite white woman at Drayton hotel, she makes a clear distinction between herself and working-class individuals by showing her desire to be separated from the \\"sweating masses\\". Irene is also concerned that people at the Negro League Dance might mistake Clare for a prostitute. Throughout the novel, Irene seems comfortable living in a higher social class while Clare constantly crosses between the two classes. = Eugenic ideology = Scholar Sami Schalk argues that the notion of eugenic ideology emerges in the novel. Eugenic Ideology assigns specific behavioral and physical traits to different distinctions of race, class, gender, and sexual identity. Both physical and behavioral features of this ideology are discussed by the main characters in Passing, Irene and Clare. For example, several times in the novel, Irene acknowledges the way white people racially designate physical traits to African Americans in order to identify them. The concept of eugenic ideology also emerges when Clare's aunts assign her to a domestic servant role believing this would align with her skin color. Thus, the aunt's perceptions of Clare's work are distinctly categorized through race. Schalk further suggests that the novel resists these notions of eugenic ideology by emphasizing how characters pass fluidly between racial identities and resist clear categories of identity. In the novel, Clare Kendry hides her racial identity from her husband and is able travel to places where African Americans are not allowed entry because no one can denote her black heritage from her behavior. In addition, Irene notes several times in the novel that the physical traits white people assign to African Americans are ridiculous. She, too, is able to pass in places where African Americans are not allowed entry and therefore defies racial categorization. The novel resists eugenic distinctions by highlighting the fluid transitions between races. =Sexuality= Repression Scholars have treated \\"sexuality\\" with caution and reticence especially during the Harlem Renaissance because the history of slavery and the objectification of the black women. Black novelists, especially female black novelists, had to be more discreet when writing about the sexuality of their characters. During this time, women, especially black women, were used as sexual objects. Due to sexual objectification, black novelists wanted to overcome the legacy of rape. They wanted to end the stereotypes of black women as \\"sexual objects\\" and to return to the \\"timidity and modesty\\" of Negro womanhood. The writers didn't want to repeat the experience of women's oppression, especially African- American women. McDowell believes that during the Harlem Renaissance female sexuality was acknowledged only in the advertising, beauty, and fashion industries and \\"sexual pleasure, especially for black women, leads to the dangers of domination in marriage, repeated pregnancy, or exploitation and loss of status.\\" According to scholar Deborah McDowell, Larsen wanted to tell the story of black women with sexual desires, but the novelist also had to be constrained in that she wanted to establish \\"black women as respectable\\" in black middle-class terms. As an example, in the novel, Irene is portrayed as sexually repressed. Irene has a tenuous relationship with her husband Brian. In fact, they have separate rooms. McDowell believes that Irene is confused by her sexual feelings for Clare, which are much more apparent. McDowell argues that the story is about \\"Irene's awakening sexual desire towards Clare\\". Homosexuality Scholars have identified a homoerotic subtext between Irene and Clare, centered on the erotic undertones in Irene's descriptions of Clare and appreciation of her beauty. As scholar Deborah McDowell's writes \\"the idea of bringing sexual attraction between two women to full narrative expression is, likewise, too dangerous a move, which helps to explain why critics have missed this aspect of the novel\\". In that interpretation, the novel's central metaphor of \\"passing\\" under a different identity \\"occurs at a surprisingly wide variety of levels,\\" including sexual. This suggests that there are other forms of \\"passing\\" that take place in the novel that are not just based on race. Larsen has a clever way of \\"deriving its surface theme and central metaphor-passing\\", disguising the plots \\"neatly\\" and \\"symmetrically\\". The apparently sexless marriage between Brian and Irene (their separate bedrooms and identification as co-parents rather than sexual partners) allows Larsen to \\"flirt, if only by suggestion, with the idea of a lesbian relationship between [Clare and Irene].\\" In the novel, these sexual innuendos appear when Irene first lays eyes on Clare at the rooftop of the Drayton Hotel. The novel describes Clare as \\"a sweetly scented woman in a fluttering dress of green chiffon whose mingled pattern of narcissuses, jonquils, and hyacinths was a reminder of pleasantly chill spring days\\". These flowers symbolize the attraction Irene has for Clare. Jonquils and narcissuses, both represent excessive interest in one's physical appearance. This alludes to Irene's obsession and physical attraction for Clare. As the novel states, \\"from the very beginning of their re-encounter, Irene is drawn to Clare like a moth to a flame\\". The character of her husband, Brian, has been subject to a similar interpretation: Irene's labeling of him as queer and his oft-expressed desire to go to Brazil, a country then widely thought to be more tolerant of homosexuality than the United States was, are given as evidence. It is also shown that Brazil is considered to be a place with more relaxed ideas about race. Irene begins to believe that Clare and Brian are having an affair to hide or distract from her own feelings for Clare. McDowell writes, \\"the awakening of Irene's erotic feelings for Clare coincides with Irene's imagination of an affair between Clare and Brian\\". Although she had no reason to accuse him, Irene did so to protect herself from her own sexual desires. = Jealousy = Scholars such as Claudia Tate and Helena Michie suggest there is a theme of jealousy throughout the novel. Both point to Irene's jealousy in terms of her appreciation for Clare's charisma and desirable appearance in the novel. As Clare meets Irene to go to the Negro Welfare League dance, Irene feels \\"dowdy and commonplace\\" in comparison to Clare, who she sees as \\"exquisite, golden, fragrant, flaunting.\\" The scholars stress that there are two aspects to this jealousy, with Irene exhibiting both bitterness in her perception of Clare, and simultaneously, feelings of affection and desire for her. Helena Michie categorizes the relationship as \\"sororophobic\\", a term she defines as a \\"fear of one's sister.\\" While Irene expresses jealousy in her admiration of Clare's beauty and social charms, she is also susceptible to their seduction and eventually begins to suspect that her husband Brian might be influenced by them as well. In her intensifying suspicions, Irene's jealousy develops into a fear of losing her family, and with it, the identity she has built for herself as a middle class black woman. Irene displays it here when deciding whether to expose Clare or not \\"She was caught between two allegiances, different, yet the same. Herself. Her race. Race! The thing that bound and suffocated her. Whatever steps she took, or if she took none at all, something would be crushed. A person or the race. Clare, herself, or the race. Or, it might be, all three. Nothing, she imagined, was ever more completely sardonic.\\" Larsen uses jealousy as the main source of conflict in the novel, and uses race as a vehicle for Irene to potentially rid herself of Clare. At this point in the story Irene realizes she can expose Clare's true racial identity to remove Clare from her life, and regain that security she desires more than anything. Albeit she feels jealousy and fear, out of loyalty for her race, Irene does not follow through with her thoughts of exposing Clare. While the novel primarily focuses on Irene's feelings of jealousy, Clare is also shown to be envious of Irene. Unlike Irene, however, Clare exhibits jealousy towards Irene's lifestyle. Clare perceives Irene as being close to her blackness and her community, a state that Clare has previously chosen to leave behind but strives to experience again. As Clare and Irene converse during Clare's first visit to Irene's home, Clare expresses her loneliness to Irene, contrasting her view of Irene's condition to Clare's own feelings of isolation: \\"'How could you know? How could you? You're free. You're happy.'\\" Clare expresses her own jealousy outwardly, even as the novel centers on Irene's inner turmoil. = Whiteness = Scholars such as Catherine Rottenberg examine how Larsen's characters struggle against race and gender norms of \\"whiteness\\" in the United States. Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture. Clare, who is of mixed race, chooses to identify with the white culture. Irene, who identifies as an African American, chooses to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture. The essence of Rottenberg's scholarship shows how the novel's characters struggle against the desire for whiteness because of the positive stereotypes society has created around \\"white\\" identity. Clare's experience growing up with her white aunts, who treated her as a servant, directly impacts Clare's initial desire towards whiteness. Hence, she passes as a white woman, marries a white man, and forgets her African-American culture. Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race, Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white. For example, Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power, but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene, she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for whiteness and returns to her African- American identification. Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Similarly, Irene identifies as black, but because she desires to feel safe and in control at all times in her life, she chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene's desire to be white comes from her wanting the middle-class lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation, which in a way, makes her feel like her marriage and the life she knows at risk. Throughout Larsen's novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve whiteness to reconnecting with the African- American culture, while Irene still has a desire to achieve \\"whiteness\\" for the feel secure. = Middle-class security = Scholars such as Andrew W. Davis and Zahirah Sabir acknowledge Irene's psychology of safety and security, which likely originated from \\"the threat of racism\\" surrounding her family. In the novel, Irene states that she places security as the first priority in her life, on top of race and friendship in the novel. Davis states that the reason that Irene prioritizes security is she wants to protect her children from the social prejudices of the time. In addition, Irene wants Brian, her husband, to stay in New York as a doctor to provide security for her children. When Brian desires to leave for Brazil, Irene is anxious due to the fact that New York is still a white society, and is a familiar to her as an African-American middle- class woman. Clare's presence in Irene's life is a threat to this security. It makes Irene sense the insecurity of her marriage with her husband, Brian. And, it makes her acknowledge the reality of questions of race and class that surround her and her children's life. = Motherhood = Passing, although focuses on the races aspect of the book, the chapters have talked about motherhood where both Irene and Clare are depicted to be mothers. It is interesting as Irene sees her sons, Junior and Theodore, differently than how Clare sees her daughter, Margery. Irene views her children as her security; she sees them as the reason Brian would stay with her. Their child ties them together and thus would make Brian stay with Irene even if they have a fallout. Irene holds her children dear to her and would do whatever she can for them. Irene is also the more protective parent compared to Brian; she wants to shield the children from the bad things in the world, like the knowledge of lynching and racism. Irene wants what's best for her children even if it means acting like specific topics do not affect them although they do, like racism. Meanwhile, Clare views motherhood as a requirement in her lifetime. She had Margery and no longer wants any more children as she cannot handle the suspense of knowing another babies' skin tone. She also mentions how \\"children aren't everything\\" this shows how she prioritizes her priorities, we see circumstances where she would leave her daughter with her husband and instead socialize with the black community. Unlike Irene, Clare actually rejects the thought of motherhood in fear that her identity might be revealed. Irene, on the other hand, is the devoted mother wanting the best for her boys, and always talking and thinking about them.https://passingnellalarsenproject.wordpress.com/2016/04/14/declining- motherhood/ Clare does not have the same attachments to Margery like Irene have to Junior and Ted as Clare sees motherhood as a binding thing that forces her to stay in a marriage she feels trapped in, while Irene is in the same boat Irene like this and uses it for her security. Critical reception Passing was published in April 1929 by Knopf in New York City. Sales of the book were modest: Knopf produced three small print runs each under 2,000 copies. While early reviews were primarily positive, it received little attention beyond New York City. Comparing it to Larsen's previous novel Quicksand, Alice Dunbar-Nelson's review in The Washington Eagle began by declaring that \\"Nella Larsen delights again with her new novel\\". Writer and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois hailed it as the \\"one of the finest novels of the year\\" and believed that its limited success was due to its treating a \\"forbidden subject,\\" the marriage of a white man to a mixed-race girl who did not reveal her ancestry. (Reprinted from ) A common criticism of the novel is that it ends too suddenly, without a full exploration of the issues it raises. Mary Rennels, writing in the New York Telegram, said, \\"Larsen didn't solve the problem [of passing]. Knocking a character out of a scene doesn't settle a matter.\\" (Reprinted from ) An anonymous reviewer for the New York Times Book Review similarly concluded that \\"the most serious fault with the book is its sudden and utterly unconvincing close\\", but otherwise considered it an effective treatment of the topic. On the other hand, Dunbar-Nelson found that the ending confirmed to the reader that \\"you have been reading a masterpiece all along.\\" In modern scholarship, Larsen is recognized as one of the central figures in the African-American, feminist and modernist canons, a reputation that is based on her two novels (Passing and Quicksand) and some short stories. As of 2007, Passing is the subject of more than 200 scholarly articles and more than 50 dissertations, which offer a range of critical interpretations. It has been hailed as a text helping to \\"create a modernist psychological interiority ... challenging marriage and middle-class domesticity, complexly interrogating gender, race, and sexual identity, and for redeploying traditional tropes‚Äîsuch as that of the tragic mulatta‚Äîwith a contemporary and critical twist.\\" However, literary critic Cheryl Wall summarizes the critical response to Passing as less favorable than to Larsen's first novel Quicksand, citing the views of Amaritjit Singh in The Novels of the Harlem Renaissance (99), of Robert Bone in The Negro Novel in America (102), and of Hoyt Fuller in his \\"Introduction\\" to Passing (14).\\" On one hand, the significance of sexual jealousy in the story has been seen to detract from the topic of racial passing; conversely, even if racial passing is accurately treated in the novel, it is considered a historically specific practice and so Passing appears dated and trivial.

They are often called clouded yellows; the North American name \\"sulphurs\\" is elsewhere used for Coliadinae in general. The closest living relative is the genus Zerene, which is sometimes included in Colias. Wing venation This genus occurs throughout the Holarctic, including the arctic regions. They are also found in South America, Africa, China and India. Their caterpillars feed on certain Fabaceae, for example vetches (Vicia). While most are thus beneficial by keeping weeds at bay, some occasionally become nuisance pests on crops like alfalfa. In some species, the wings of males have brilliant ultraviolet reflection, while those of females do not. Adults of both sexes have various colour forms. Most if not all species of this genus, as usual for Coliadinae, do not sequester toxins or other noxious compounds from their food plants. They are therefore a well- loved prey item of insectivores as compared to Pieris of the related Pierinae. They make up this disadvantage by being more nimble and better able to evade attacks by would-be predators. Notable lepidopterologists who did many studies on this genus included Julius R√∂ber, J.

In general, cladistic analyses of only one type of data (particularly mtDNA sequences) cannot be considered reliable. Regardless, the evolutionary distance within some \\"species\\" is so large that cryptic speciation rather than (or in addition to) interbreeding seems to be the cause. For example, the Beringian populations traditionally assigned to the northern clouded yellow (C. hecla) could warrant recognition as a species; hybridization between North American and Asian populations seems to have played a role in their evolution, but as a whole they appear to be a rather old and distinct lineage.

As a member of the faculty of the College of Education, he designed and directed the internationally recognized doctoral and master's programs in Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Languages (TESL/TEFL), which he led for more than twenty years. Jenks served as major advisor for fifty doctoral dissertations and more than 300 master's degree recipients. He founded and directed The Center for Intensive English Studies (CIES) at FSU from 1979 to 2002. He was an adjunct professor at Flagler College, a Fulbright Senior Specialist, a legal expert witness in second language assessment and an advocate in the Florida legislature for public-school English language learners. He was born in Buffalo, New York. In 1982, he designed and directed the first MA-TESOL program delivered by an American university totally outside the United States. Sponsored by ARAMCO, the Saudi Arabian oil company, the innovative program graduated 72 students during the five-year contract. He and Dr. James D. Brown, the program coordinator, were assisted by numerous TESOL experts including Drs. Stephen Gaies, Thomas Buckingham and David Eskey. Panama Canal Branch From late 1996 through 2000, he was the Director of Florida State University Panama Canal Branch campus in the Panama Canal Zone which, via a long-term contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, served as the Canal Zone's primary university, offering degree programs to military personnel and families, Canal Zone employees and residents, and Panamanian citizens. His mission was to seek ways for the university to continue operations after the reversion of the Canal Zone to the Republic of Panama in late 1999. The politically sensitive goal was achieved with support from the President and Legislative Assembly of Panama, USAID, Panamanian alumni and the U.S. Embassy. Former U.S. Ambassador to Panama, Simon Ferro, stated in 2000 that \\"The largest remaining U.S. footprints in the Republic of Panama are the Embassy and Florida State University-Panama.\\" Jenks was instrumental in acquiring from the Panamanian government exclusive use of the former campus of the Panama Canal College, formerly the Canal Zone's community college. Today, FSU-Panama is chartered as a private Panamanian university, offering degree programs under an academic accord with FSU. Works He was founding editor of the quarterly American Foreign Language Teacher from 1969 to 1974, edited twenty books and monographs on language education for Advancement Press of America, and served as editor of Heinle & Heinle's Foreign and Second Language Education series from 1978 to 1981. His professional writing can be found in journals ranging from Classical Outlook to TESOL Journal, and in numerous books, festschrift and anthologies. A popular speaker, Jenks delivered over 100 keynote addresses and papers at international and national conferences.

From 1987 to 2004, he was actively engaged as a member of several ETS-TOEFL committees including the Policy Council, Research Committee and TSE revision committee. As an Academic Specialist for the U.S. Department of State, Jenks completed three assignments in the former Yugoslavia (1983, 1984, 1989) and one in East Germany (1991). In 1987, he was chosen as the first U.S. TEFL professor to offer in-service teacher training in the former Czechoslovakia after 31 years of USSR occupation. That same year, he was appointed Distinguished Visiting Professor of English and International Studies at the University of Tennessee, Martin. In 1993,he was selected as a Fulbright Senior Scholar at Universidad Autonoma de Heredia, Costa Rica, thereafter joining and chairing the Fulbright EFL Selection Committee. Jenks was awarded the PhD by Wayne State University, having previously earned a Master of Arts degree from Case Western Reserve University (1966) and the Bachelor of Arts in Modern Languages from Grove City College in 1963.

It is directed by Robert Clampett and is the second to feature the character Beaky Buzzard. This is the last cartoon in which Kent Rogers performed voices, as he died in a training flight accident on July 9, 1944. Plot Beaky Buzzard's mother sends him and his brothers out with the mission of bringing home something to eat. While his brothers wreak havoc dive-bombing various creatures and eventually bring back a milk cow (along with the farmer), a string of circus elephants (including a baby one brandishing a banner reading \\"I am NOT Dumbo\\", a reference to the Disney film of the same name), and a dog (clinging to a fire hydrant), Beaky manages only to capture a baby bumble bee. While flying back carrying his \\"prey\\" he sings \\"I'm bringing home a baby bumble bee\\" to the tune of \\"The Arkansas Traveler\\". A larger bee, presumably the parent, arrives and stings Beaky, who crash lands and is able to sooth his sting in some water. While there, a small head pops out from behind rocks. Beaky picks a fight with the animal he calls \\"Shorty\\". He yanks on the head and tries to lift it from the ground before realizing that what he is confronting is actually a large dragon. Beaky runs from the dragon, and the scene changes to the mother buzzard worrying late into the night about him not returning home. When he arrives she is both glad that he showed up and angry that he seemingly brought nothing for dinner. However, when the camera moves down, it is revealed that Beaky caught the dragon, who dismisses the mother's claim by saying \\"Well now, I wouldn't say that!\\" (a la Mr. Peavey of The Great Gildersleeve).

It was the location of the Wilcox, Crittenden company, a marine hardware firm. The historic district listing included four contributing buildings and three other contributing sites. Buildings The mill complex consists of four surviving mill buildings, built between 1814 and 1917, and foundational remnants of others, as well as two brownstone dams. Mill A, built in 1814 to house weaving operations, was converted into an office when larger facilities were built. Mill B, located to its north, is long, and was built between 1901 and 1912. Mill C is a concrete block structure built in 1907, and is long. Mill D stands across the ravine of Pamachea Creek from Mill C, and is the youngest of the four buildings. Relationship to surroundings Mill C, photographed 2012 This building is sited on the north bank of Pameacha Creek. It is located in a commercial and industrial area and faces the busy intersection of Warwick and South Main Streets. Nearby are related, later factory buildings. A modern solar-energized bank is located across the intersection to the west. Significance The main part of this structure was erected in 1814 by John Watkinson as a woolen factory. Pamecha Creek was a prime source of water power in Middletown; a mill had occupied this site since the 1650s. Following Watkinson's death in 1836, this building was occupied by another woolen business, known as The Pamecha Manufacturing Company. In 1849 William Walter Wilcox, a young and aggressive factory worker, went into business with Ira Penfield, his employer. Together they continued manufacturing Penfield's recently patented grommet (a small metal device used in the raising and lowering of sails) in the basement of this building, and established the firm of Penfield and Wilcox. Wilcox then went on the road, successfully selling this new device, and establishing a coast-to-coast reputation. When Penfield retired in 1857, Wilcox took in Joseph Hall Jr. as a partner and the firm known as Wilcox and Hall was established. Hall left the business in 1867. in 1869 the firm acquired the name by which it has been known for over one hundred years, The Wilcox, Crittenden and Company. The firm's prominent managers at this time were William Walter Wilcox, Albert R. Crittenden (a former Middletown Mayor), E. Bound Chaffee, and Homer Churchill. This firm brought force and strength to the ships' chandlery business. They constructed additions to the existing structures to meet their rapidly growing needs. Their success was attributed to honesty, paying close attention to the business and having a good understanding of maritime needs. On a summer night in 1907 a devastating fire attacked the premises. Virtually every building and its contents on Pamecha ravine was destroyed, except for a small brick structure and the addition to the south. This determined firm rebuilt within two years, without losing a customer or laying off an employee. Except for this building and a slightly larger and later structure on the south side of the Pamecha Creek, all the structures related to the firm were built after the 1907 fire. This -story brick structure displays some of its early exterior features; brownstone sills and lintels, and two corbelled chimneys. The windows on the west facade were lengthened, the brownstone lintels removed and replaced by segmental-arched brick lintels. The cupola was replaced. The wing, attached to its south wall, probably dates from the late 19th century. More decorative, it displays corbelled brick work and an unusual arched window on the west facade. A large mural of a clipper ship is painted on the south wall. The Pamecha Creek played an important role in Middletown's early manufacturing operations. The many water-powered factories located on its banks were largely responsible for this city's industrial prosperity in the early nineteenth century. This building is one of the few survivors of that prosperous era. The site is additionally significant as an archeological site. Not only has it been in continuous use since 1650, but documents indicate that much of the machinery and tools damaged in the 1907 fire were not removed from the steep ravine. Current use and condition Three of the four surviving mill buildings have been converted to apartments. Mill B and the rather small Mill A are a condominium; Mill C on the other side of South Main Street is low- income housing).

During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, he collaborated extensively with the German occupation forces. He was the husband of Florentine Rost van Tonnigen.  Early life  Meinoud Marinus Rost van Tonningen was born on 19 February 1894 on the island of Java, in the city of Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). He was the son of KNIL general Marinus Bernardus Rost van Tonningen, who had distinguished himself suppressing the revolts against Dutch rule on Lombok, Aceh and Bali. After high school he completed legal studies at the University of Leiden. In the periods 1923‚Äì1928 and 1931‚Äì1936, he was representative of the League of Nations in Vienna. His job was to monitor the Austrian financial policy. While stationed in Vienna, he developed strong anti-semitic and anti-communist convictions. He became close friends with Engelbert Dollfuss, who became Chancellor of Austria in 1932 and who was murdered in 1934.  NSB period  He became a member of the NSB on 7 August 1936 after returning from Austria. He won a seat in Parliament in the elections that year and became the leader of his parliamentary party in the Dutch House of Representatives. He also became editor-in-chief of the NSB party newspaper, Het Nationale Dagblad, which he made into a vessel of his own ideas to the dismay of the NSB party leadership. Rost van Tonningen was obsessed with Germany and the Greater German Idea, while Anton Mussert, the leader of the NSB, had more affinity with the idea of Fascism as carried out by Benito Mussolini in Italy. It was mainly Rost van Tonningen's influence that caused the NSB to become more openly anti-semitic; Rost van Tonningen's anti-semitism was more radical than NSB leader Anton Mussert. Because of his influence. the NSB became closer to the German Nazi Party, the NSDAP. 1939 saw Rost van Tonningen establish the paramilitary organisation ‚Äì the Mussert guards. Many members of this organisation later became members of the Nederlandsche SS. Rost van Tonningen's request to be admitted as a member of the SS Westland regiment was at first denied, because he had been born in the Dutch East Indies, and was unable to obtain documents showing that his family had 150 years of \\"pure Aryan blood\\". However, from 1943, Indos (Dutch Eurasians) could join the lower ranks of the Waffen SS. (Whereas those deemed to be \\"Native Indonesians\\", with no or little European ancestry, were still not allowed.) In 1944, Rost van Tonningen again applied for membership of the SS, and was admitted.  German occupation of the Netherlands  During the German occupation of the Netherlands, Rost van Tonningen was appointed liquidation commissar for all Marxist organisations by Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the Austrian administrator for the Netherlands. This was targeted especially at the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSAP), and the Communist Party (CPN). The CPN and RSAP had to be liquidated, while the SDAP had to be \\"reconstructed\\" based on Nazi doctrine. This reconstruction failed because the SDAP had destroyed most of its archives and administration papers. The SDAP leadership refused to cooperate, and during regional meetings of the SDAP it was announced that the SDAP would not collaborate with the German occupation forces. Virtually all SDAP affiliated organisations refused to cooperate with Rost van Tonningen's attempts to 'Nazify' them. Most organisations (e.g., Labourers Sports Association, musical organisations) chose to dissolve themselves rather than become part of the Nazi hierarchy. On 5 July 1941, the SDAP was disbanded, together with all other remaining political parties.  Financial administrator  On 26 March 1941, Rost van Tonningen was appointed to the posts of Secretary-General of the Finance ministry and President of the Dutch National Bank, the Nederlandsche Bank. During his tenure in these functions, the Germans held the Netherlands financially responsible for the costs of the occupation of their country. The total cost of this to the Dutch society was calculated by the Dutch government after the war as being 9,488,000,000 Reichsmark. Besides this amount, an amount of 5,750,000,000 Reichsmark of loans made by the Netherlands to Germany was never repaid, so a total amount of 14,500,000,000 Reichsmark flowed to Germany. (Comparison: France 43,250,000,000 and Belgium 11,070,000,000.) On 1 April 1941, the currency barriers between the Netherlands and the Third Reich were removed, and on 1 September 1941, the last obstructions in the currency markets between the two countries were finally removed. This meant that the Germans could trade the gold of the Dutch National Bank for paper Reichsmarks. The other financial heads of occupied territories were not as eager as Rost van Tonningen to remove the barriers and the Netherlands could not spend the Reichsmarks obtained in this way to pay these other countries. The other territories brought their Reichsmarks to the Netherlands to pay their foreign debt; Germany, Denmark, Hungary and Occupied France all paid their debts in this way. This and the purchase of Dutch goods for Reichsmarks by the Germans made the Dutch balance of Reichsmarks grow from 83,000,000 (March 1941) to 3,646,000,000 (September 1941). Rost van Tonningen in the meantime kept printing large amounts of Dutch money. This led to large inflation figures. As Secretary-General for Special Economic Affairs, Rost van Tonningen was involved in the establishment of the Nederlandse Oostcompagnie (Dutch East Company), an organisation involved in the reconstruction of the Ukraine. The efforts of this company were an abysmal failure.  Death  Meinoud Rost van Tonningen married Florentine Heubel in 1940 On 5 September 1944, Dolle Dinsdag (Mad Tuesday), Rost van Tonningen fled with a number of other Dutch collaborators, fearing the rapidly advancing Allied armies. He turned up again a few days later, but was fired from his position as successor to the NSB leadership by Anton Mussert after writing an article in which he praised the members of the Dutch NSB youth organisation (Nationale Jeugdstorm, National Youth Storm) who had joined the Hitlerjugend division. In the summer of 1944, Rost van Tonningen was trained to be an officer in the first battalion of the Landstorm Nederland, a Dutch paramilitary defense organisation. In March 1945 he left for the frontlines, which ran through the middle of the Netherlands, in the Betuwe. On 8 May 1945 he was taken prisoner by Canadian troops, and was held in a prisoner camp in Elst. From there he was transferred to Utrecht and on 24 May 1945 he was moved to the prison in Scheveningen. Rost van Tonningen allegedly committed suicide there by jumping from a balcony in the prison on 6 June 1945. There have been persistent rumors, but no proof, that he did not jump by himself. He never stood trial for his actions.  Family  His second wife, Florentine Rost van Tonningen, continued to promote pro-German and Nazi views, denying the Holocaust and regretting the fall of the Third Reich and any threat to racial purity. One of their sons, Ebbe Rost van Tonningen, published a memoir in 2012 about his childhood, In Niemandsland (\\"In no man's land\\").

She was named after Alexander Macomb, the Commanding General of the United States Army from May 29, 1828, until his death on June 25, 1841. Macomb was the field commander at the Battle of Plattsburgh, during the War of 1812, and after the stunning victory, was lauded with praise and styled \\"The Hero of Plattsburgh\\" by some of the American press. He was promoted to Major General for his conduct, receiving both the Thanks of Congress and a Congressional Gold Medal. Construction Alexander Macomb was laid down on 18 February 1942, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCE hull 36, by the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Baltimore, Maryland; and was launched on 6 May 1942. History She was allocated to A.H. Bull & Co., Inc., on 2 June 1942. =Sinking= She sailed from New York City, where she loaded her cargo of of tanks, aircraft, and explosives for the Soviet Union, to join Convoy BX 27 for Halifax, on her maiden voyage. The convoy was set to departed from the northern end of the Cape Cod Canal on 2 July 1942, but with the grounding of the cargo ship on 28 June 1942, it was forced to sail around Cape Cod. On the evening of 3 July 1942, sailing in heavy fog and with the fear of colliding with other ships in the convoy, Alexander Macomb fell behind. With hope of catching up with the convoy in daylight, the captain of Alexander Macomb only maintained an intermittent zigzag course. At 12:30, on 4 July, with the rear of the convoy and her escorts in sight, Alexander Macomb was struck between the #4 and #5 holds by a torpedo from , at . The torpedo caused her cargo of explosives to ignite and burst into flames. The crew of eight officers, 33 crewmen, and 25 Armed guard were able to abandon the ship in three lifeboats and a raft. Because the ship had not been secured and still had forward movement one of the lifeboats capsized. Alexander Macomb sank at 13:00, east of Cape Cod. The British trawler picked up 23 crewmen and 8 Armed guards, while the Canadian corvette picked up another 14 crewmen and 11 Armed guards. Six Armed guards and four crewmen died in the attack. Le Tiger and pursued U-215 and succeeded in sinking her with depth charges, with a loss of all hands. Wreck discovery The wreck of Alexander Macomb was discovered in October 1964, by the Risdon Beazley company salvage ship Droxford at position . The bulk of the metal cargo was removed in 1965, by Droxford. She is considered to be \\"dangerous to dive\\".

AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312 (TSgt and above) are Security Forces personnel who completed the 10 week Combat Arms Apprentice Course (Lackland AFB) and conduct marksmanship training to prepare all Air Force personnel for home station and deployment operations. Combat Arms specialists lead, manage, supervise and implement small arms weapons training programs. Their duties include operating firing ranges and associated facilities, enforcing range safety, inspecting/repairing weaponry, performing preventative maintenance, developing/utilizing training aides and determining training/maintenance resource requirements. Combat Arms personnel also provide training in safeguarding weapons, ammunition and equipment; instructing small arms weapons qualification training and providing guidance on weapons placement to SF and other ground defense force commanders. Combat Arms Instructors are the Air Forces small arms weapons Subject Matter Experts (SME).  History  During the Korean War, several incidents occurred which called attention to the small arms training provided to Air Force personnel. The most significant was the tragedy at Kimpo Air Base, Korea, which was overrun by a numerically superior Chinese communist force. The Air Police Squadron was so overwhelmed that they were forced to fight a rear guard action before being annihilated. The general base population was then easily defeated before reinforcements arrived to drive the enemy back. The remaining personnel found alive by the Chinese were hanged in the main hangar on Kimpo. This hangar still stands today as a memorial to those who died without a chance to fight. The resulting investigation revealed serious deficiencies in the way small arms training was perceived and carried out in the Air Force. Prior to the Korean War, no formal program of weapons training existed. One result was the inability of the majority of personnel at Kimpo to successfully defend themselves and the base. The majority of the base weapons were inoperable due to lack of maintenance. The few serviceable ones were of little use as personnel were not trained in their use, unable to even load or aim them. Only the Air Police were routinely trained in marksmanship and maintenance of small arms. Please note not everyone agrees the \\"Kimpo Massacre\\" occurred. The US Air Force Police Alumni Association website addresses this claim on their website. http://www.usafpolice.org/korea.html The experience of the Korean War encouraged General LeMay, then Vice Chief of Staff and former Strategic Air Command commander, to pursue a course that was to change the way weapons training was received by Air Force personnel. In 1958, twenty-five experienced USAF competitive shooters were selected to become the initial instructor cadre of the USAF Marksmanship Center located at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. The marksmanship program was designed by Colonel Tom Kelly, former Commander of Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and under the direction of Colonel Peter W. Agnell. The initial cadre attended the U.S. Army's advanced rifle marksmanship coaches class at Fort Benning, Georgia from 26 January to 15 February 1958. The three-week training course included coaching techniques, range management, and procedures for the preparation of marksmanship training programs. The purpose of the initial cadre was to train Small Arms instructors and gunsmiths for assignment to all Air Force bases. With these personnel as a core for the newly formed USAF Marksmanship Center, bases throughout the world began selecting personnel to be sent to the center for training. On 5 November 1958, the first class was conducted consisting of 32 students. The initial course was 12 weeks in duration and graduated qualified Small Arms instructors who returned to their bases to establish local Marksmanship Programs. The new instructors were awarded the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 753X0 and the expanded program included intensive training for aircrews, Air Police, Air Base Defense personnel to improve the overall weapons capability of all Air Force personnel. In 1965, the USAF Marksmanship unit's name was formally changed to Small Arms Marksmanship Training Unit (SAMTU). This change designated what weapons the career field was responsible to train. Besides meeting local training objectives and conducting competitive rifle and pistol matches, Small Arms specialists set up and operated specialty courses. The USAF Sniper School, located at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, was one of these and existed from 1965 to 1967. Its purpose was to train personnel to carry out their assigned duties effectively in the Republic of Vietnam. There was also a 72-hour Southeast Asia (SEA) course in operation through 1971. Its purpose was to prepare all Air Force personnel en route to Southeast Asia. [NOTE: Some Air Force Snipers, who were assigned to the Air Commando units and were not instructors, were sent to the Marine Sniper School during 1965-1968.] Control of the marksmanship program moved from Washington D.C. to Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, in 1978. This move was to enhance the program management. The career field again felt another change in 1982 when it was functionally restructured to report to the Air Force Office of Security Police. With this change came the re designation to \\"Combat Arms Training and Maintenance\\" (CATM). On November 1, 1993, the AFSC was changed to more closely align the career field with the Security Police career field. The new designation was 3P1X1 for CATM instructors and 3P1X1A for gunsmiths. The career field also shared the same functional badge with Security Police and the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), which designated the basic level, the 7-level, and Senior NCO Academy graduate level. Since then the career field again changed and Combat Arms instructors were merged with Security Forces in 1997, with the first graduating \\"Security Forces\\" Class on 10 April 1997, becoming Security Forces first and Combat Arms as a \\"shred-out\\" of the AFSC. The new inclusive Security Apprentice course )L3ABR3P031-000) became the norm with training at Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas. CATM instructors now have the AFSC of 3P0X1B through the rank of SSgt and are designed SEI 312 as TSgt and above.  The Combat Arms Instructor's Creed  Since the introduction of the Airmans Creed in 2007 by General T. Michael Mosele, all other creeds are officially unrecognized by the Air Force. This also includes the Security Forces Creed. > I am an Air Force Combat Arms Instructor. My country's strength lies in the > men and women I train and their weapons which I maintain. > My students hold faith and place great trust in me. Their lives depend on > my ability and their confidence in my integrity for in a time of war their > talent will be needed. > They are to be treated with fairness and discretion for my country's > resources are entrusted to their watchful eye, and their survival is in my > hands. > My students I MUST NOT FAIL, My students I WILL NOT FAIL.

In his retirement he returned to Ecclefechan, where he is buried. British Army surgeon He entered the British Army on 14 April 1795 and was posted to the 11th Hussars as an assistant surgeon. Arnott was promoted to surgeon on 23 August 1799. He followed his unit to Holland and was present at the storming of the entrenchments at Krabbendam. He was later transferred to the 20th Regiment of Foot at Menorca and was present at the storming of Alexandria. He continued to served with the 20th Regiment at Malta, Sicily and Calabria and was present at the Battle of Maida. He continued to serve with the 20th Regiment at the Vimiera and in the retreat from the Battle of Corunna. He followed his unit in the Walcheren expedition where his military unit was decimated by fever. In 1812 Arnott served with the Duke of Wellington in his campaigns until the end of the war, including the Battle of Vittoria, in the Pyrenees and in India. Arnott's belt buckle worn whilst attending Napoleon on his deathbed. Buckle is the Regiment Badge of the 20th Foot. Collection of the Yuko Nii Foundation. As the fourth and last of Napoleon's physicians on St. Helena, Arnott arrived, following his regiment in 1819, and on 21 April 1821 visited Napoleon in his professional capacity. He quickly established excellent relations with the Emperor, becoming his most trusted doctor, and attended to him until his death. The Emperor was bedridden for some days as a result of persistent vomiting and Arnott prescribed potions, with no initial results, eventually prescribing a sedative generally thought to be opium, which relieved the Emperor's symptoms. On 3 May, Arnott prescribed calomel for the Emperor's constipation with good results. Prior to his death, Napoleon ordered a snuff box brought to him and carved an \\"N\\" with a pen knife and presented it to Dr. Arnott, along with a locket of his hair, a pair of duelling pistols and a handkerchief. The snuff box was last known to be in the possession of Alan Cunningham, a British Army officer. The pistols are in the collection of the Small Firearms Museum, Warminster, Wiltshire. During the night following the Emperor's death, Arnott took a death mask made from surgical wax (as no gypsum was available on the island) and inscribed it with his signature and the date 6 Mai 1821. This is now in the collection of the Mus√©e Mass√©na in Nice, France. On 3 May 1821 Napoleon gave instructions that should he become insensible, no English physician but Arnott was to touch him. Napoleon died on 5 May 1821, and Arnott attended his post-mortem examination. The Emperor bequeathed Arnott six hundred Napoleons and the British government gave him an additional payment of five hundred pounds. Writings After his retirement to Ecclefechan and his estate of Kirconnel Hall, Arnott acquired a collection of anecdotes of the period and wrote an \\"Account of the last illness, Decease, and Post-mortem appearances of Napoleon\\" in 1822. Respected by his neighbours, he was buried in Ecclefechan churchyard.

Produced by Jack Good (creator of the television series Shindig!), the musical guests on the show included Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Little Richard, the Clara Ward Singers, the Buddy Miles Express, Paul Arnold and the Moon Express, and We Three in musical performances. Although they were billed as musical guests, Julie Driscoll and Brian Auger (alongside their then-backing band The Trinity) found themselves playing a prominent role; in fact, it can be argued that the special focused more on the guest stars (specifically, Auger and Driscoll) than the Monkees themselves. This special is notable as the Monkees' final performance as a quartet until 1986, as Peter Tork left the group at the end of the special's production. The title is a play on \\" revolutions per minute\\". Overview The story follows Brian Auger and his assistant (Driscoll) as they take The Monkees through various stages of evolution until they are ready to brainwash the world via commercial exploitation. Trapped in giant test tubes, the four are stripped of all personal identity and names: Micky Dolenz becomes Monkee #1, Peter Tork becomes Monkee #2, Michael Nesmith Monkee #3, and Davy Jones Monkee #4. Each Monkee (under Driscoll's watch) attempts to regain their stripped personal identities by thinking a way out of captivity into their own world of fantasies. Monkee #1 (Dolenz) performs an R&B; up-tempo duet remake of \\"I'm a Believer\\" with Driscoll; Monkee #2 (Tork) reclines on a giant cushion in Eastern Garb and, to the lilting backing of sitar and tabla, performs \\"I Prithee (Do Not Ask For Love),\\" a gentle number concerning spiritual values. Monkee #3 (Nesmith), in an inventive blue-screen number, sings a country tune with himself, \\"Naked Persimmon\\"; and a toy-sized Monkee #4 (Jones) sings and dances to the tune of \\"Goldilocks Sometime.\\" Next, the Monkees perform \\"Wind Up Man\\" in the stiff-legged form of robots (dressed similar to the outfits they debuted in). Auger, criticizing their performance, introduces a four-part piano harmony in a unique piano-stacked set up with Auger and his electric keyboard on top, then descending to Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and finally Fats Domino on the bottom. Disapproving Auger's brainwashing method, Charles Darwin steps in and inexplicably switches to Paul Arnold and the Moon Express' \\"Only The Fittest Shall Survive\\", a psychedelic dance performance. Then the Monkees, clad in ape costumes, perform Neil Sedaka's \\"I Go Ape\\". With his work done, Darwin allows Auger, Driscoll, and the Trinity to work from there, while singing the Young Rascals' \\"Come On Up\\". With the process complete, Auger introduces the Monkees to a gig at the Paramount Theater on December 7, 1956, and describing them as \\"idolized, plasticized, psychoanalyzed, and sterilized\\". The four, dressed in outlandish 1950s vocal group gear, are then immediately launched into a classic '50s rock medley: \\"At The Hop,\\" \\"Shake A Tail Feather\\" \\"Little Darlin',\\" \\"Peppermint Twist,\\" backed up by Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Fats Domino, We Three, and The Clara Ward Singers. The guest performers contributed their own songs to the medley, with the Ward Singers performing \\"Dem Bones\\" as the segment's finale. Peter Tork's girlfriend Reine Stewart stood in as drummer for Fats Domino when his regular drummer couldn't attend. Scene from the special At the end of the medley, Auger and Driscoll break character and say that the brainwashing concept has gone out of hand and they would rather see The Monkees have \\"complete and total freedom\\" which Driscoll describes as \\"utter bloody shambles\\". The rest of the special takes place in a warehouse full of instruments and props. It begins with Davy standing atop a high staircase performing Bill Dorsey's \\"String For My Kite\\". Peter enters the scene next and performs, on a Hohner Clavinette harpsichord, Solfeggietto by C.P.E. Bach. Finally, Mike and Micky arrive and perform \\"Listen To The Band,\\" with Nesmith on Black Beauty guitar (Gibson Les Paul Custom), Tork on keyboards, Dolenz on drums, and Jones on tambourine (in what turned out to be their final appearance as a quartet until 1986, as well as their final network television appearance as a quartet until 1996). As the song progresses, they are joined by extras (Good sent buses down to Sunset Strip to round up about 100 extras for \\"a party\\") and all of 33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee's guest musicians from The Trinity to the Buddy Miles Express resulting in a climactic frantic cacophony, similar to the crescendo in \\"Revolution 9\\"; it pans aside to a book with \\"Chaos is Come Again\\" on the next page. The book closes with \\"The Beginning of the End\\" on the back cover. The closing credits feature a reversed scene from the Moon Express' dance sequence, with Tork singing \\"California, Here I Come\\" over the credits as California is nuked killing off the fictional Monkees. Production and broadcast issues The general opinion of the viewers and participants of Revolutions per Monkee claim the special to be chaotic, both on-screen and off-screen. The Monkees went into rehearsals for the program one day after their return from their Australasian tour in October 1968. Production on the program began in November 1968, after completing a press tour promoting their film, Head. Music sessions with Bones Howe and Michael Nesmith producing commenced in mid-November, with the final taping of the special occurring at the end of the month. Before production started, a strike at NBC almost meant that the special could not be taped; however, stage space was found at MGM Studios in Culver City, and the sets were transported there. Because it was a last-minute change of location, the special was directed from outdoor broadcast trucks parked outside the soundstages. The Monkees were reportedly angry with producer Jack Good and director Art Fisher's script for Revolutions per Monkee, calling it \\"too sloppy, too fairy-tale like,\\" while Davy Jones felt that, for a TV special starring the Monkees, it emphasized rather largely the guest cast over the group itself. Peter Tork, in liner notes for The Monkees Anthology CD compilation, called ' \\"the TV Version of Head\\". Tork was, at one point, the only Monkee working on Head; but, ironically enough, it was Tork who bought out his Monkees contract at the end of production of Revolutions per Monkee (on December 20, 1968), reportedly suffering from exhaustion. Tork's departure reduced The Monkees to a trio, and the group was not seen on network TV as a foursome again until 1997. After production wrapped, Tork was given a gold watch as a going-away present, with the inscription \\"To Peter, from the guys down at work.\\" Negotiations were originally made in early 1968 for The Monkees to star in three NBC-TV specials to air in 1969; Revolutions per Monkee was the first. Unhappy with the final edit, NBC decided to air it on the West Coast opposite The 41st Academy Awards on ABC. Further damage was done to the telecast by an engineer who accidentally presented Revolutions per Monkee out of sequence. These incidents prompted NBC to cancel plans to produce the remaining Monkees specials. Because of the technology of the time, the Hawaiian broadcast of the special was delayed for two weeks. At the time, television stations in Hawaii received network programming via film and videotape, as there were no telephone connections capable of television broadcasting; it was finally shown there on April 28. Its telecast in Great Britain occurred on Saturday, May 24 on BBC2.

The version of Revolutions per Monkee released individually in January 1997 (R3 2284) has been on file for years at The Museum of Television & Radio (now known as the Paley Center for Media) in New York City, with good sound quality, a fuzzy picture and the segments in original broadcast order. The DVD version features two commentary tracks; one by Brian Auger and the other by Micky Dolenz, who has mixed feelings about the program. The special was remastered for the Monkees' 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray box set, but due to licensing restrictions, \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\" was edited out from the medley. Soundtrack No official soundtrack has been released; nor was such a soundtrack planned, because of the technology of the time, wherein singers sang live vocals over prerecorded tracks. It has also been said that many of the songs were left at MGM when production finished. Some songs, however, have been officially released as bonus tracks on recent deluxe editions of Head and Instant Replay. The versions of songs with vocals have been lifted directly from the television audio. A number of low-quality demo recordings are known to exist, including versions of \\"A String for My Kite\\" and \\"Wind Up Man\\" and unused songs \\"Buttoning the Buttons\\", \\"I Am a Fish\\", \\"Lucky You\\" and \\"The Bus & The Crocodile\\" - all performed by the same musician, probably the show's main songwriter Bill Dorsey.Songs written by Bill Dorsey \\"I Am a Fish\\" was recorded by Tiny Tim under the title \\"The Other Side\\" in 1968.\\"The Other Side\\" by Bill Dorsey Tracks \\"I Ain't No Miracle Worker\\" and \\"I Wish That I Were Dead\\" (a.k.a. \\"But Now I Find\\") were officially-released singles by The Brogues but have been erroneously listed as demo recordings for Revolutions per Monkee, as has \\"My Community\\", written by Roger Atkins and Carl D'Errico, which was recorded by Tiny Tim under the title \\"Community\\" in 1968. A vinyl bootleg, possibly recorded by placing a microphone in front of a television speaker while the program played, was produced by Zilch Records.Prindle, Mark. \\"Prindle Record Reviews ‚Äì The Monkees.\\" Prindle Rock And Roll Record Review Site.

The initiative involves establishing and implementing a framework for public health information systems.  PHIN Design  PHIN is designed to do the following: * Enable the consistent exchange of health data * Protect the security of the health data exchanged * Ensure that the network will be available at all times = PHIN Structure = The 5 Functional Areas of PHIN: #Detection and Monitoring #Data Analysis #Knowledge Management #Alerting #Response  PHIN's Impact on Public Health  PHIN attempts to provide the public health sector with continuous access to necessary health care information. Access to near real-time data attempts to improve community based interventions that are implemented as a result of terrorism or disease outbreaks. PHIN provides supports and helps improve the outcomes of various public health programs including the following: * The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services **Desired outcome: improving public health information systems. * The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services **Supports: Terrorism Defense, Healthcare Delivery Improvement, and IT Enhancements. * Healthy People 2010 **Supports: Focus area 23 - ensure that public health agencies have the adequate infrastructure to effectively provide essential public health services. * Partners in public health **Desired outcome: \\"Roadmap\\" for establishing national capacity for public health systems.  Budget and funding  PHIN first received funding in 2004 through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 25% and 30% of the $849 million of funding received through the Public Health Response and Preparedness Cooperative Agreement was to be used to focus on improving public health preparedness in all 50 states, 4 metropolitan areas and 8 US territories. In 2004 the initiative of the program was to \\"ensure that all public health partners have, or at least will have, access to a system or systems to accomplish established preparedness functions.\\" For year 2005, additional finances will be available to states through the terrorism cooperative agreement. This agreement will support the development of current and new systems, in state health and public health departments, which will meet the PHIN standards and specifications.  Partnerships  In order to collect and assess information system requirements for PHIN, the CDC works with public health partners, some of which include: *NACCHO - National Association of County and City Health Officials *ASTHO - Association of State and Territorial Health Officials With the assistance of these partners, PHIN can target the following functional areas regarding preparedness: #Early Event Detection #Outbreak Management #Connecting Laboratory Services #Partner Communications and Alerting #Countermeasure/Response Administration  Governance  The approval of technical and data standards for PHIN is completed by two working groups in the CDC Information Council (CIC). The following organizations are represented on each working group by 2 members of its staff: Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By regulation the standards conform to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requirements and the Federal Health architecture. CIC also ensures that the following standards are met: *E-Gov activities, which includes all regulations contained in the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) goals *Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) initiative *Federal Geographic Data Committee standards required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-16 *Public Health line of business and Public Health Monitoring Sub-function of the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model  Preparedness  = Early Event Detection = In the realm of preparedness, the PHIN has developed systems to promote early event detection. Information systems that connect health care providers to the PHIN allow for rapid reporting of cases that may lead to public health emergencies. These information systems include call reporting systems, web-based systems, and other electronic case reporting systems. The PHIN has set up technical requirements so that facilities can be equipped to participate in these rapid reporting systems. These requirements also ensure that facilities can protect patient privacy in their reports and ensure integration with outbreak management. = Outbreak Management = Another component in preparedness, the PHIN has a division of outbreak management which allows public health agencies to be adequately prepared for true outbreaks. The outbreak management system is integrated with the early event detection systems to ensure rapid, smooth awareness of outbreaks. The CDC and PHIN currently employ an Outbreak Management System software application to effectively manage data related to outbreaks.  Connecting Laboratories  Another component of PHIN is connecting laboratories through a set of computer communication standards called HL7. This allows specimen receipts and laboratory results to be exchanged between health organizations and agencies. This is especially useful in times of a health outbreak or other disaster.  Countermeasure and Response Administration  The PHIN also works to track and support the supply of vaccinations and as well as the administration of these tasks. As part of this functionality, the PHIN allows limited supplies of vaccines and other needed drugs to be allocated properly when they are in short supply. Some vaccines and drugs will be traceable to clinics and drug administrators. PHIN also supports response administration by allowing adverse events to be monitored and quarantined populations to be monitored if necessary.  Standards and Specifications  PHIN has a set of Vocabulary Standards and Specifications that: # Supports the development and deployment of standards- based public health information systems. # Seeks to promote the use of standards-based vocabulary # Fosters the use and exchange of consistent information among public health collaborators. # Ensures that the vocabularies are aligned with PHIN and CHI standards.

The damaged ship was cut into three sections. The fore and aft sections were joined together, and the ship made her way to Baltimore, Maryland, to be rebuilt. The middle section was left in Aruba and, after being used for a number of years as a target by Dutch gunners after the war, has become a scuba diving site.

Its early origins are found on a private association founded in 1838 by a group of lawyers from Lisbon. Graduates in law from university who wish to act on behalf of clients before a court of law must register at the Portuguese Bar Association. Only those who are duly registered can provide legal consultation and appear before the court. Other graduates in law may choose other jobs, which do not demand registration at the bar association. Being a public association, it is independent from the government, but it has some public powers, which include disciplinary action over its members. Its decisions are subject to judicial impeachment. In Portuguese law, an attorney-at-law is known as advogado. His job equals that of both solicitors and barristers (although Portugal also has a separate profession of solicitor, or solicitador). The internship for a Portuguese recently graduated Lawyer to become full member of the Bar, includes a complex week-long exam at first, three day long pre-exams on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday, then a usually unpaid, though sometimes paid, internship of eighteen months and finally, a last exam for a whole day.

Pointon was a left-back who is perhaps best remembered for playing for Everton, Manchester City and Oldham Athletic. Career Pointon began his career at lower-league Scunthorpe United and quickly established himself as a regular first-teamer and a consistent and reliable performer in defence. In the autumn of 1985, after four years at Scunthorpe, Pointon was bought by the reigning English league champions Everton for ¬£75,000, manager Howard Kendall hoping Pointon could provide squad cover for regular left-back Pat Van Den Hauwe. Ultimately Pointon ended up featuring in the majority of Everton's games during the remainder of the 1985/86 season as a result of Van den Hauwe moving to central defence to cover for the injured centre-back Derek Mountfield. Everton finished that season as runners-up to local rivals Liverpool in both the league championship and the FA Cup, though Pointon played no part in the FA Cup final due to Mountfield's return to fitness. In the following season, Pointon struggled with injury and had to compete with not only Van den Hauwe but also veteran defender Paul Power, signed from Manchester City, for the left-back spot at Goodison. Pointon did however play enough games that year to qualify for a Championship winners medal as Everton won their second title in three years. Over the next couple of years Pointon was a consistent performer in the Everton defence when called up to the first team, although Kendall's departure to Athletic Bilbao and the break-up of the Championship winning side saw a decline in the club's fortunes. During 1989/90, Pointon became Everton's first choice left-back following the sale of Van den Hauwe to Tottenham Hotspur. In the summer of 1990, Pointon left Everton to rejoin Howard Kendall at his new club Manchester City, with Kendall receiving Pointon and ¬£300,000 in exchange for Andy Hinchcliffe. Pointon spent two years at City as a first-team regular before moving on to Joe Royle's Oldham Athletic, then a top-flight club. Pointon spent three years at Boundary Park, during which time the club were relegated from the Premiership. On 10 April 1994, Pointon put the Latics ahead in the 106th minute (extra time) of the FA Cup semi final at Wembley Stadium against Manchester United, only for Mark Hughes to equalise one minute before the final whistle and force a replay. The replay at Maine Road saw the Latics lose 4‚Äì1, with Pointon scoring Oldham's consolation goal. United went on to win both the Premier League title and FA Cup, while Pointon and his colleagues had the double misery of an FA Cup exit and Premier League relegation in less than a month. During this period Neil made the tabloid papers following a brief liaison with television personality Dani Behr. Pointon joined Scottish Premier Division outfit Heart of Midlothian in 1995, enjoying a number of seasons up in Scotland before later playing for Walsall, Chesterfield and Hednesford Town. He scored for Hednesford against former club Oldham Athletic in an FA Cup tie at Keys Park, soon before being handed the reins as Manager at Hednesford. He lasted as little as 9 games in his first Managerial post before being sacked after not winning a single game. The club were later relegated. After a spell as player-manager of Retford United he joined Mossley as a player and helped Mossley to win the Worthington Challenge Trophy at Gigg Lane, Bury with a 2‚Äì1 win over Clitheroe in his last ever professional game. He currently works for Higher Lane Primary School as a sports coach.

It is part of the Pinellas County School System. The school's athletic teams are known as the Tornadoes. Their colors are crimson and gray, which is also the name of their fight song. History Clearwater High School traces its lineage to 1906, when three 9th-graders were enrolled at a small schoolhouse built that year on Ft. Harrison Avenue. In 1924, Clearwater High School was built on Greenwood Avenue, where it remained until the current campus on Hercules Avenue was completed in 1954. In 1999, a $12-million renovation of the facilities was completed. Academics Clearwater High has various academic programs, also known as Academies, centering on different aspects of life beyond high school, as well as an optional University of Cambridge AICE Diploma program alongside them. In 2017, The Washington Post ranked it as the \\"most challenging high school\\" in Pinellas County, based on the number of Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate students as a percentage of graduating seniors. The school offered 18 AP courses that year, while attaining an 88% graduation rate, with 73% of graduates going on to attend a four-year college. Athletics The school's 4,200-seat football stadium was built in 1950 and dedicated in 1951 as Central Pinellas Stadium. It 1963, it was renamed to honor Jack White, a judge on the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, who was a leading figure in the effort beginning in 1949 to build the stadium. In addition to football, other boys' sports include baseball, swimming, and wrestling. The Clearwater Tornadoes compete in a variety of sports for both boys and girls, including basketball, soccer, golf, track and field, lacrosse, and tennis. Under head coach Jack Wilson, the Tornadoes won the boys' basketball state championship in 1981. The school's Jack L. Wilson Gymnasium is named in his memory.

Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame Web site, Web page titled \\"Emily Dunning Barringer\\", accessed August 15, 2011 Emily Dunning was born in Scarsdale, New York to Edwin James Dunning and Frances Gore Lang. The well-to- do New York family fell on hard times when she was about ten years old, and her father left for Europe to try to recoup his fortune, leaving her mother with five children. When a well-meaning friend of Dunning's mother suggested that the girl might become a milliner's apprentice, her mother said \\"That settles the question. You are going to go to college.\\" Dr. Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi, a friend of the family, recommended Cornell University's medical preparatory course, and her uncle, Henry W. Sage, a founder of Cornell, agreed to pay her tuition. Other family friends also helped with expenses. Emily Dunning graduated in 1897 and decided to attend the College of Medicine of the New York Infirmary. During her sophomore year there, the college merged with the new Cornell University School of Medicine. National Library of Medicine Web site, Web page titled \\"Celebrating America's Women Physicians: Changing the Face of Medicine: Dr. Emily Dunning Barringer\\" accessed November 1, 2006 She earned her medical degree in 1901, then received the second-highest grade in the qualifying exam for an internship at Gouverneur Hospital in New York City. The hospital denied her application. The next year she applied again, this time with the support from political and religious figures, and the hospital accepted her‚Äîthe first woman ever accepted for post-graduate surgical training in service to a hospital. Barringer at her 1901 graduation Residency Emily Dunning Barringer as a resident at Gouverneur Hospital in New York City \\"Barringer's fellow medical residents assigned her difficult 'on call' schedules and ward duties, and harassed her in other ways,\\" according to the Web site of the National Medical Library. She wrote about the harassment in her autobiography, which \\"illustrates the value of support from mentors, family, friends, nursing staff, and the public.\\" A woman doctor was a curiosity for the Lower East Side neighborhood where she worked, and New York City newspapers published feature articles about her. She married Benjamin Barringer, also a physician, the day after she finished her residency in 1904. The couple had two children, Benjamin Lang Barringer (1910-1992) and Velona Barringer Steever (1918-1989). During World War I, she served as vice-chair of the American Women's Hospitals War Service Committee of the National Medical Women's Association (later the American Medical Women's Association) and led a campaign to raise money for ambulances to be sent to Europe. Later career After the war, Barringer took a post on the gynecological staff at New York Polyclinic Hospital. She was also an attending surgeon at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, specializing in the study of venereal disease. She also became an attending surgeon at Kingston Avenue Hospital in Brooklyn and later its director of gynecology. Barringer was an advocate of women's suffrage and worked to improve medical education for women, public health, and reforms for the treatment of imprisoned women. She was President of the American Medical Women's Association in 1942. As Co-chair of the association's War Service Committee, she organized the American Women's Hospital in Europe, which provided medical and surgical care during and after the war. During World War II, Barringer lobbied Congress to allow women doctors to serve as commissioned officers in the Army Medical Reserve Corps. Congress passed the Sparkman Act in 1943, which granted women the right to receive commissions in the Army, Navy, and Public Health Service. She later lived in Darien and New Canaan, Connecticut. She was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 2000. Her autobiography, Bowery to Bellevue: The Story of New York's First Woman Ambulance Surgeon, was made into a 1952 film, The Girl in White, by MGM.

Landolfi is considered among the half dozen finest stringed instrument makers in history, along with Stradivarius and Guarneri del Gesu and Pietro Guarneri. Instruments created centuries ago by Landolfi and his fellow Italian luthiers have not been improved upon despite modern technology and are still played by the finest violinists and violists in the great concert halls across the world. Landolfi was born in Milan, Italy in 1714 and after an apprenticeship in Cremona, Italy, he returned to Milan in 1734, age 20, and created his workshop. As his instrument labels indicate, he worked \\"Contrada Santa Margherita, al Segno della Sirena,\\" in the central metropolis of Italy's Lombardy region, at the center of the city's busy mercantile and artistic activities. Landolfi's career continued in Milan throughout his life. Instruments Landolfi may have been the last of the classical Italian master luthiers to use Cremonese methods of construction and of compounding varnishes. For his finest instruments, Landolfi chose the woods with exceptional care and used superb varnishes of a particularly striking hue. Landolfi's best instruments have similarities to the work of Guarneri del Gesu, but the Landolfis have unique characteristics reflecting constant refinement over the course of his career. For example, Landolfi developed an approach that increased the arching of the belly of each violin and viola with relation to the back. And his careful workmanship included scroll carving of a particularly graceful manner, often smaller and broader than the work of other master luthiers. Importantly, Landolfi's most exceptional instruments possess a full tone of great carrying power. For that reason, over the centuries Landolfis have been prized by solo performers. Musicians who have owned Landolfis include Carl Flesch, the Hungarian violinist and teacher (1873 - 1944) who played both a Landolfi and the Brancaccio Stradivarius.

It is not clear who first coined or popularized the term. The concept appears in Dmitri Borgmann's 1965 book, Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities, though he uses the term isogram, and in a 1985 article, Borgmann claims to have \\"launched\\" the term isogram then. In the 1985 article, he suggests an alternative term, asogram, to avoid confusion with lines of constant value such as contour lines, but continues to use the term isogram in the article itself. The term isogram or nonpattern word has also been used to mean the same thing. Isogram has also been used to mean a string where each letter present is used the same number of times. Multiple terms have been used to describe words where each letter used appears a certain number of times. For example, a word where every featured letter appears twice, like \\"appeases\\", might be called a pair isogram, a second-order isogram, or a 2-isogram. A perfect pangram is an example of a heterogram, with the added restriction that it uses all the letters of the alphabet. Uses in ciphers Heterograms can be useful as keys in ciphers, since heterogram sequences of the same length make for simple one-to-one mapping between the symbols. Ten-letter heterograms like PATHFINDER, DUMBWAITER, and BLACKHORSE are commonly used by salespeople of products where the retail price is typically negotiated, such as used cars, jewelry, or antiques. For example, using the PATHFINDER cipher, P represents 1, A represents 2 and so on. The price tag for an item selling for $1200 may also bear the cryptic letters FRR, written on the back or bottom of the tag. A salesman familiar with the PATHFINDER cipher will know that the original cost of the item was $500, so that if the price is negotiated he will not accidentally eliminate all of the 140% margin in the $1200 price shown to prospective buyers. A twelve-letter cipher could be used to indicate months of the year.  Longest examples  In the book Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities, Dmitri Borgmann tries to find the longest such word. The longest one he found was \\"dermatoglyphics\\" at 15 letters. He coins several longer hypothetical words, such as \\"thumbscrew-japingly\\" (18 letters, defined as \\"as if mocking a thumbscrew\\") and, with the \\"uttermost limit in the way of verbal creativeness\\", \\"pubvexingfjord-schmaltzy\\" (23 letters, defined as \\"as if in the manner of the extreme sentimentalism generated in some individuals by the sight of a majestic fjord, which sentimentalism is annoying to the clientele of an English inn\\"). In the book Making the Alphabet Dance, Ross Eckler reports the word \\"subdermatoglyphic\\" (17 letters) can be found in Lowell Goldmith's article Chaos: To See a World in a Grain of Sand and a Heaven in a Wild Flower. He also found the name \\"Melvin Schwarzkopf\\" (17 letters), a man living in Alton, Illinois, and proposed the name \\"Emily Jung Schwartzkopf\\" (21 letters). In an elaborate story, Eckler talked about a group of scientists who name the unavoidable urge to speak in pangrams the \\"Hjelmqvist-Gryb-Zock- Pfund-Wax syndrome\\". The longest German heterogram is \\"Heiz√∂lr√ºcksto√üabd√§mpfung\\" (heating oil recoil dampening) which uses 24 of the 30 letters in the German alphabet. It is closely followed by \\"Boxkampfjurysch√ºtzlinge\\" (box fight jury fosterlings) and \\"Zw√∂lftonmusikb√ºcherjagd\\" (twelve-tone music book chase) with 23 letters. The longest Dutch heterogram is \\"Exvakbondsjuryzwijgplicht\\" (former union jury oath of secrecy) with 24 of the 27 Dutch letters.

The plot concerns the conflict between a wealthy couple and a poor laborer after a worldwide terrorist attack isolates them in a small remote ranch. 9/Tenths was filmed outside of Los Angeles, CA in Canyon Country. Its world premiere was at the 2006 Sedona International Film Festival on February 24, 2006. Plot The film takes place sometime in the not too distant future where terrorist attacks are on the rise and cities are the primary targets. Jessica (Gabrielle Anwar) and husband William (Henry Ian Cusick) have fled the city amid the increasing terrorist threats. William is excited to relocate to his newly purchased ranch hundreds of miles from nowhere. Jessica reluctantly humors her husband and his paranoid fears by going along. On their arrival, William and Jessica discover someone already living in their house. Elias (Dave Baez) proves quite an intimidating presence when the couple discovers him in their kitchen butchering a freshly killed animal. But Elias soon explains in his broken English that he was the caretaker for the previous owner who had promised to let him continue living there as a reward for his services. William knows of no such arrangement and quickly attempts to get rid of this man he sees as nothing more than a trespasser. Elias sees the couple the same way and develops his own ideas about sending them back to the city. Meanwhile, it quickly becomes obvious that William is of little use in this rustic environment that Elias calls home. Even a simple task like fixing a broken water heater is beyond William's range of expertise. \\"I pay people to do these things for me,\\" he blurts out. Obviously successful in the professional world, William is at a loss in his newfound sanctuary. William's frustration festers as he observes Elias's adroitness with such tasks. Just as the property dispute escalates to a dangerous level, the three hear parts of an emergency radio broadcast indicating that an extremely large terrorist attack has caused widespread, catastrophic destruction in the world around them. The three are cut off from everything, completely in the dark as to whether anybody at all, is left alive in the area, the country or even the world. Civilization as they have to know it may have ended. This alters the dynamic between the pampered city couple that are totally invested in what is known as civilization, and the self- sufficient Elias. As time goes by and the couple's supplies diminish, Elias, formerly a second-class citizen at best, finds himself in a position of power since he is the only one with the skills needed to survive. This change in events brings forward Elias attraction to Jessica which is intertwined with the desperate circumstances, leading all three down a frightening and depraved path none would have ever expected. Music The music score for the film was composed by Brian Ralston. The score features 3 solo instruments (solo viola, solo female soprano and solo flamenco guitar) that are symbolic of the three main characters in the film over an orchestral foundation. A soundtrack for the film has not yet been released.

Biography  He was the second but eldest surviving son of Johann Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and his first wife Sophie Auguste of Anhalt- Zerbst. When his father died in 1707, Ernst August became co-ruler (Mitherr) of Saxe-Weimar, along with his uncle Wilhelm Ernst, but his title was only nominal, since Wilhelm Ernst was the actual ruler of the duchy. Only when Wilhelm Ernst died in 1728 did Ernst August begin to exercise true authority over Saxe-Weimar. =Excesses= Ernst August was a splendor-loving ruler, and his extravagances contributed to the eventual financial ruin of his duchy. Desperately in need of funds, he resorted to the practice of arresting wealthy subjects without cause, and setting them free only after they had renounced their fortunes to the duke, or had paid exorbitant ransoms. Some of the victims, who considered this behaviour illegal, made claims against the duke at the Imperial Court in Vienna or in the Imperial Chamber Court of Appeal in Wetzlar. Ernst August lost all the legal proceedings mounted against him. The process lasted for many years and eventually led to the duchy's bankruptcy. The duke maintained a standing army that was disproportionately large for the duchy's population or financial resources. Some of the soldiers were rented to the Electorate of Saxony or to the Holy Roman Emperor. Ernst August's mania for building led to the construction of the Kleinode, the small Schloss Belvedere and the Rococo Schloss of Dornburg, a lavish residence for the duke. His passion for the hunt was likewise extravagant; when he died, Ernst August left 1,100 dogs and 373 horses. The duke maintained a standing \\"harem,\\" in which two noble \\"Ladies of Honour\\" (Ehrenfr√§ulein) and three \\"Chamber Women\\" (Kammerfrauen) of low birth attended to his desires. =Marriages and children= In Nienburg on 24 January 1716, Ernst August married Eleonore Wilhelmine of Anhalt-K√∂then, daughter of Emmanuel Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt- K√∂then. They had eight children: # William Ernest (b. Weimar, 4 July 1717 ‚Äì d. Halle, 8 June 1719), Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weimar. # Wilhelmine Auguste (b. Weimar, 4 July 1717 ‚Äì d. Weimar, 9 December 1752), twin of Wilhelm Ernst. # John William (b. Weimar, 10 January 1719 ‚Äì d. Weimar, 6 December 1732), Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weimar. # Charlotte Agnes Leopoldina (b. Weimar, 4 December 1720 ‚Äì d. Weimar, 15 October 1724). # Johanna Eleonore Henriette (b. Weimar, 2 December 1721 ‚Äì d. Weimar, 17 June 1722). # Ernestine Albertine (b. Weimar, 28 December 1722 ‚Äì d. Alverdissen, 25 November 1769), married on 6 May 1756 to Philipp II, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe. # Bernhardina Christina Sophia (b. Weimar, 5 May 1724 ‚Äì d. Rudolstadt, 5 June 1757), married on 19 November 1744 to John Frederick, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. # Emmanuel Frederick William Bernard (b. Weimar, 19 December 1725 ‚Äì d. Weimar, 11 June 1729). After the death of his first wife in 1726, the duke decided to not marry again, choosing to live quietly with his Ladies of Honor and Chamber Women. But in 1732 the situation changed unexpectedly: his only surviving son, the hereditary prince (Erbprinz) Johann Wilhelm, died. This made it necessary for him to find a new wife and sire sons in order to perpetuate the dynasty. In Bayreuth on 7 April 1734, Ernst August married his second wife, Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, daughter of George Frederick Charles, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. They had four children: # Charles Augustus Eugen (b. Weimar, 1 January 1735 ‚Äì d. Weimar, 13 September 1736), Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weimar. # Ernst August II Konstantin, Duke of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach (b. Weimar, 2 June 1737 ‚Äì d. Weimar, 28 May 1758). # Ernestine Auguste Sophie (b. Weimar, 4 January 1740 ‚Äì d. Hildburghausen, 10 June 1786), married on 1 July 1758 to Ernst Frederick III Karl, Duke of Saxe- Hildburghausen. # Ernest Adolph Felix (b. and d. Weimar, 23 January 1741 / b. Weimar, 1742 ‚Äì d. Weimar, 1743) [?]. The duke also had an illegitimate son with Friederike von Marschall: # Ernest Frederick (b. 1731 - d. 1810), created Freiherr von Brenn; married to Beate Helene Bormann, his line died out in the male line in 1849. =Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and absolutism= In 1741 the branch of Saxe-Eisenach-Jena became extinct with the death of Wilhelm Heinrich, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. As the only surviving kinsman of the late duke, Ernst August inherited his estates; the union between Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach-Jena now became permanent. One of the duke's few wise decisions was the institution of the Primogenitur in Saxe-Weimar (confirmed in 1724 by the Emperor Karl VI); this stopped further land divisions in the future. From 1741 his new duchy took the name of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Jena was merged by Eisenach), but the union was by this time only personal. The new state consisted of two larger areas around the two official residences in Weimar and Eisenach, which were not connected, and a patch of smaller areas and towns between them. The annexation of Saxe-Eisenach was favorable to the hunt-loving duke; he possessed a large swath of woods in the Eisenach region, which seemed suitable to him for hunting. He left the Hereditary Prince in Weimar in the Schloss Belvedere, under the guardianship of his Hofmarschall, and moved permanently to Eisenach. After this, the duke rarely asked for his son, and sent the most unreasonable written instructions from Eisenach to Weimar in order to supervise his son's education. The Hereditary Prince saw his father for the last time in 1743. Ernst August tried to implement Absolutism in Saxe- Weimar on the French model. The secret Ratskollegium ‚Äîa consultative organ national formed by nobles‚Äî was dissolved. In 1746 the citizens of Eisenach presented the duke a memorandum detailing national prerogatives, in which he was denounced for constant offences against traditional rights. The gesture demonstrated that the citizens of the duchy were resisting the introduction of absolutism, thus certain policies that Ernst August had planned could not be completely carried out. The duke's death prevented a terrible controversy between the national nobles and the citizens of Eisenach. =Death= Upon his death, Ernst August left a financially ruined duchy, and a successor to the throne (Ernst August II) who was still under age.

It is notable that the song title does not have an umlaut in it; that was added to the band name at a later stage. The lyrics \\"Sun rise wrong side of another day, sky high and six thousand miles away\\" are explained as: :\\"I was on tour with Hawkwind in 1974, we were staying at the Riot House [Hyatt Hotel in Los Angeles] and Roy Wood and Wizzard were also in town.

Overview Krauss discusses the physics involved in various concepts and objects described in the Star Trek universe. He investigates the possibility of such things as inertial dampers and warp drive, and whether physics as we know it would allow such inventions. He also discusses time travel, light speed, pure energy beings, wormholes, teleportation, and other concepts that are staples of the Star Trek universe. The book includes a foreword by astrophysicist Stephen Hawking. The Physics of Star Trek was met with generally positive reviews. It became a national bestseller and sold more than 200,000 copies in the United States. As of 1998, it was being translated into 13 different languages.

She served as a sail training ship until she capsized and sank on 17 February 2010. Description Concordia was built by Colod of Szczecin, Poland in 1991, and completed in April 1992. She was long, with a beam of and a draft of . She was to the top of the highest mast. Her hull was made of steel, and she was rigged as a barquentine. As well as sails, she was propelled by a MAN diesel engine, which could propel her at . History Concordia was designed by Ryszard Langer and owned by the West Island College Class Afloat program. Her port of registry was Bridgetown, Barbados but she was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. On 5 December 1996, an explosion on board during battery charging resulted in the death of a crew member, 18-year-old Derek Zavitz. Zavitz was thrown overboard and his remains were never found. Sinking On 17 February 2010, SV Concordia encountered what the vessel's captain called a microburst some southeast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in rough seas and high winds. The vessel was knocked onto its side within 15 seconds and eventually sank 20 minutes afterward. In September 2011, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada report found, \\"The wind speeds experienced by the vessel at the time of the knockdown were most likely in the range of . While there was probably a vertical component to the wind, there is no evidence that a microburst occurred at the time of the knockdown.\\" The report also found the vessel was operated in a way that did not allow it to, \\"...react to changing weather conditions appropriately and maintain the stability of the vessel.\\" All aboard successfully abandoned ship. As the capsizing was so fast, no radio distress call was made but an EPIRB was hydrostatically released and automatically activated when the vessel sank. The Concordia sank at 1423 hrs local time Wednesday. At 1425 Concordia's Bosun Geoffrey Byers swam to retrieve the EPIRB and brought it aboard the rafts. The Captain directed that someone hold the EPIRB upright at all times and keep it safe from damage. The EPIRB signal was received at 1505 hrs by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES 12. The position of the sinking, , was resolved at 1525 local time. The TSB report noted the EPIRB database only listed one telephone number for the Concordia and that number had not been in service since 2004. The following morning at 0806 hrs the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre Brazil sent a fax to Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax requesting information about the Concordia. After attempting to contact Concordia a Brazilian Air Force aircraft was dispatched at 17 hrs local time Thursday and sighted the liferafts 3 hours later. The survivors spent nearly 30 hours in liferafts before the aircraft spotted them. Flares were fired from the rafts, and the aircraft blinked its landing lights in response and directed nearby merchant ships to the scene. The lights of the Mitsui O.S.K. Lines woodchip carriers and were sighted by the survivors at 1:30 am local time and the rescue was completed by 8 am local time. 41 hours after the sinking the crew were safely aboard the rescue ships. All 64 people (48 students, eight teachers and eight crew) who were on board were rescued from 3 large and 1 small liferafts.

Name  Serbian and Macedonian place names mean apple, Hungarian name (official name Toront√°lalm√°s from 1898 to 1918) meant apple of Toront√°l, and German name (official name Apfeldorf from March 1943 to September 1944) meant apple village. A legend tells about Serbian fishermen who settled near an apple tree, and it was published in printed edition for first time in 1912. There is no deed or other written evidence of founding by first settlers.Samu Borovszky, Magyarorsz√°g v√°rmegy√©i √©s v√°rosai.

Geography  Jabuka is located on flat and fertile plain nearby Tami≈° river at , approximately 11 km NW of Panƒçevo and 27 km NE of Panƒçevo bridge to Belgrade.  History  Community office in Jabuka, built in 1901 Entry to the village In the 1970s, scientific staff of Archaeological Institute Belgrade carried out extensive excavations on communal area. The scientists found objects and tracks of temporary settlement of Neolithic (Vinƒça and Starƒçevo cultures), Chalcolithic (Baden culture) and Iron periods.Simo Mladenovski, Banatsko selo Jabuka, Skopje 1989, p. 19-24. The communal area was part of Teme≈üvar Eyalet in Ottoman Empire since 1552, after the Treaty of Po≈æarevac part of Habsburg's Banat, since 1765 of military frontier (Austrian Empire) and then it belonged to Toront√°l county of Austria-Hungary. After World War I was that area part of provisional Torontalsko-tami≈°ke ≈æupanja (Treaty of Trianon), in 1922 of Belgrade oblast and since 1929 of Danubian Banovina in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In time after World War II its belonged to Srez Panƒçevo of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The communal area of Jabuka was part of administrative region of Panƒçevo municipality from all these centuries to the present. The modern village of Jabuka was founded by Slavic fishermen in the end of 17th and beginning of the 18th century. (\\"Selo je imalo 15 porodica slovenskog porekla\\", their names were Stoikov, Stepan, Pavao and Damian) They might be coming from Romania or Bulgaria.Simo Mladenovski, Banatsko selo Jabuka, Skopje, 1988. In the first half of the 18th century there were about 15 houses in the village. After the peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1726, Claudius Florimund Graf von Mercy, a man with Lorraine origin, took control of the administration of the Military Frontier. He ordered the inhabitants of Jabuka to be members of the border battalion (Grenzbezirkshauptmannschaft) Opovo - Panƒçevo. The census from 1733 recorded 19 Slavic (i.e. Serb) families in the village. In the middle of the 18th century, there was 60 houses in the village, and during this time, its inhabitants were Serbs.Dr Slobodan ƒÜurƒçiƒá, Naselja Banata - geografske karakteristike, Novi Sad, 2004. In 1921, population of village numbered 3,265 inhabitants, including 2,819 Germans, 348 Romanians, 73 Hungarians, 20 Serbs or Croats, 2 Slovenes, 2 Russians and 1 Englishman.Op≈°ta dr≈æavna statistika, Definitivni rezultati popisa stanovni≈°tva od 31 januara 1921 godine, Sarajevo 1932, p.354-355.Ljubi≈°a Ivanovski, Jabuka kroz vekove, Qubesoft, Panƒçevo 2011, . During the World War II, the village was under Axis occupation. In 1941, on a location named Strati≈°te near the village, German forces killed around 600 Jews and Roma in three separate executions. In 1945, a monument (memorial pyramid) dedicated to these victims was built, and later, another monument with memorial house was built too. In 1944, one part of German population left from the region, together with defeated German army. The remaining Germans of the village were sent to local imprisonments which existed until 1948. After prison camps were dissolved, many of German population left Yugoslavia because of economic reasons.Christine Mergel, Josef Jerger, Stefan Metha and Mathias Ulrich, Heimatbuch der Ortsgemeinde Jabuka Torontalalmas Apfeldorf, Ludwigshafen 1990.Ljubi≈°a Ivanovski, Jabuka kroz vekove, Panƒçevo 2011. In the time period after World War II the village was settled with families that originated from all parts of Yugoslavia. Most of the settlers were from Macedonia, many of them originating from Kriva Palanka Municipality. In 1948, the majority of inhabitants were Macedonians (2,806 or 63.88%).Savezni zavod za statistiku, Konaƒçni rezultati popisa stanovni≈°tva od 15 Marta 1948 godine, Knjiga IX, Belgrade 1954, p. 338.Simo Mladenovski, Banatsko selo Jabuka, Skopje 1988, p. 88-90. =Topographic history= On 9 May 1768, Joseph II wrote an impression of the structural condition of the village during his inspection of the new part of southern military frontier into his diary: Jabuka is worst of all villages. At the instigation of Viennese Hofkriegsrat and after approval of the financing by Viennese Hofkammer the village was new created and built up until 1774. There is a historical plan of the new village which is kept at the Austrian National Archives. At the beginning of the 19th century, cotton was planted on a trial basis in the northern Jabuka area but it was stopped because of long-term profitability reasons. In 1808, Archduke Ludwig opened a fruit plant nursery which existed until 1873. There is an impression of the old village and the plant nursery (German Obstgarten Plantage) which is recorded on the map of the Franciscan land survey from the early 19th century at the National Archives of Austria. In 1905, cadastral maps of the village were recorded which are kept at the National Archives of Hungary. In 1910, the village consisted of 675 buildings, 478 made of stones or bricks, 147 made of air dried bricks or clay with stone or brick foundation and 50 made of timber or other materials. 627 buildings had roofs made of tiles, slate or sheet metal and 48 made of thatched reeds or straw.Felix Milleker, Geschichte der Banater Milit√§rgrenze 1764-1873, Wittigschlager Panƒçevo 1925, p. 49.Map of Jabuka in 1774, Plan G I h 3 of the Maps and Plan Collection by National Archives of Austria and the Institute of Military History Budapest on the Website of Hungarian Cultural Heritage Portal, retrieved on 2018-02-20.Vaterl√§ndische Bl√§tter f√ºr den √∂sterreichischen Kaiserstaat, Volume 1, Vienna 1810, p. 191 on Google Books.Carl Bernhard von Hietzinger, Statistik der Milit√§rgrenze, Volume 2, Vienna 1820, page 92 on Google Books.Franz Van√≠ƒçek, Specialgeschichte der Milit√§rgrenze, Volume 4, Vienna 1875, p. 280 on Google Books.Historical Map of Franciscan Land Survey (1806-1869), Retrieved on 2018-01-03.Cadastre maps Jabuka (Hungarian Alm√°s), Retrieved on 2018-01-03.Magyar Kir√°ly K√∂zponti Statisztikai Hivatal, A magyar szent korona orsz√°gainak 1910. √©vi n√©psz√°ml√°l√°sa, Budapest 1912, Volume 42, p. 369 on the Website of Hungarian Cultural Heritage Portal, retrieved on 2018-01-09. Orthodox church Saint Elijah From 1959 to 1960, the old Roman Catholic Church was demolished due to dilapidated and damp foundations. A part of the dry bricks was used for construction and renovation of new and old houses of the village. The Church was built from 1773 to 1774 in neoclassical stile and renovated gradually and partially from 1829 to 1833, and its deed, dated 14 November 1833, was sealed in a niche behind altar during consecration ceremony, and original deed of foundation stone laid, dated 4 July, was situated on the ground in front of altar. After demolition of last remains of foundation walls, both historical deeds were handed over by governmental authorities of village to Diocese of Zrenjanin and Historical Archive Panƒçevo.

In 1901, the small Orthodox church was built (consecration deed, dated 24 June). Before completion of the church, the Orthodox residents (369 Vlachs and 13 Serbs in 1890) had to go to the churches of the competent parish communities in Sefkerin or Panƒçevo. The Church is dedicated to Saint Demetrius. In 2011, the construction of the big Orthodox Church started, which was mostly financed by donations. The first mass was celebrated in August 2014.

Wilson's use of the phrase \\"evolutionary epic\\" in 1978.E. O.

Wilson, 1978, p 201. Wilson was not the first to use the term but his prominence prompted its usage as the morphed phrase 'epic of evolution'. In later years, he also used the latter term. Naturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on Wilson's term and have used it in a number of texts. These authors however have at times used other terms to refer to the idea: Universe Story (Brian Swimme, John F. Haught), Great Story (Connie Barlow, Michael Dowd), Everybody's Story (Loyal RueRue, Loyal. Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution, SUNY Press, 1999, ), New Story (Thomas Berry, Al Gore, Brian Swimme) and Cosmic Evolution (Eric ChaissonChaisson, Eric.

Such efforts commonly go under the names 'evolutionary epic,' 'epic of evolution,' or 'epic of creation'.\\" Narrative Evolution generally refers to biological evolution, but here it means a process in which the whole universe is a progression of interrelated phenomena, a gradual processJ. C. Polkinghorne, The Work of Love: Creation as Kenosis, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, (Peacocke chapter) page 21, in which something changes into a different and usually more complex form (emergence). It should not be 'biologized' as it includes many areas of science.Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley ‚Äì The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, page 229, In addition, outside of the scientific community, the term evolution is frequently used differently from scientists' usage. Even respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic changes. Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a wrong definition in mind. This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a different perspective.Laurence Moran ‚Äì What is Evolution, 1993 retrieved 4-07-09 The same applies to the use of the term theory as used in the theory of evolution (see references for Evolution as theory and fact). This epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind of tale. It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon.Merriam-Webster It is a form of myth that has an approach to investigation that is empirical or scientific.Epic of Evolution is definitely mythic ‚Äì Brian Swimme interview According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposes‚Äîprovide meaning for a maturing individual (an individuate) and how to be part of a community. This Epic does both.Duncan Campbell in one of his interview The epic as myth William Grassie of Temple University writes that the word \\"myth\\" in common usage is usually misunderstood. In academia it defines \\"a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society\\". He suggests that the Greek term mythos would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more all-encompassing. He concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this epic of evolution. If anything, there is an anti-interpretation tradition. Consequently, this is dangerous as it is a powerful revelation at this time.Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time?- retrieved 3-22-09 Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted, not simple or easy to understand. It takes a romantic vision, philosophical rigor, and artistic interpretations. It requires a consilience of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity. The ancient wisdoms of the world's spiritual traditions must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic.William Grassie, Science and Spirit 1998, 9(1) ‚Äì page 6 of this ref- Science and Spirit retrieved 3-16-09 Interpretations of the epic E. O. Wilson explained that humans had a need for the epic of evolution because they must have a mythical story or a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it. Religious epics fulfill a primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves. The best empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality.Edward O. Wilson, Foreword of Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution By Loyal D. Rue, SUNY Press, 1999, page ix and x,, He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way. Edward O. Wilson, Consilience 1998 In a similar vein, biologist Ursula Goodenough sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles. It is a story that people can work with in a religious way if they elect to do so.Ursula Goodenough ‚Äì Sacred Depths of Nature, Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (June 15, 2000), Philip Hefner uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic. The warp anchors the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry. The Epic, as scientists see it, is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it (we are all weavers) but the patterns all have the warp in common.Classic Quotations ‚Äì Philip Hefner, 1997 AAAS Epic of Evolution Conference Hefner writes that stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy. It is not science; it is scientifically informed myth, a myth driven by the refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose. It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domain of religion-and-science.Hefner ‚Äì The Evolutionary Epic ‚Äì Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 5,6 Biologist Ursula Goodenough also makes use of Hefner's weaving metaphor.Ursula Goodenough ‚Äì The Sacred Depths of Nature, Oxford University Press US, 1998, page 272, Connie Barlow and Michael Dowd's Great Story divides the epic into 8 phases eons or eras: the Great Radiance, the Galactic, Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. Great Story Timeline Dowd uses the term 'epic of evolution' to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology (a form of theistic evolution). His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive.Evolution Theology: Religion 2.0 He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe. Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance.Thank God for Evolution An entry by Barlow in Bron Taylor's The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature gives four primary categories: cosmic, planetary, life, cultural. Loyal Rue states that there is nothing in the core of everybody's story to rule out belief in a personal deity. However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and non-theistic versions of it.Loyal Rue ‚Äì Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution, SUNY Press, 1999, He says it is the fundamental story of matter, created from energy, the organization of that matter into complex conditions, and then via self-organization into diverse life forms. Humans are as other living things‚Äîwe are by nature star-born, earth-formed, fitness-maximized, biochemical systems. An aspect of the Epic is the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system.Loyal Rue ‚Äì Religion is not About God, Rutgers University Press, 2006, Part 1.1, Brian Swimme sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe and as an antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism. It is the way into the future and enabled him to comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview. It may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history. To him evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity (similar to Gordon Kaufman's thinking). Although the Epic is scientific, it is 'definitely mythic'‚Äîit has the fundamental nature of being mythic. \\"You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebuds, giraffes and humans.\\" Center for the Story of the Universe Gordon D. Kaufman sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process. He states that it is a notion that can interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe (from the Big Bang outward), as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence. The whole vast process manifests (in varying degrees) serendipitous creativity, an everflowing coming into being of new modes of reality.Gordon D. Kaufman ‚Äì God, mystery, diversity: Christian theology in a pluralistic world, Fortress Press, 1996, page 101‚Äì102, retrieved 3-17-09 In his book, In the beginning‚Äîcreativity, he says this creative process is God. Creativity, as metaphor, and as defined in the concept of evolution, has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God. The most foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmos/biological evolution‚Äîa paradigm that is now the organizing principle of all the sciences.Gordon D. Kaufman ‚Äì In the beginning‚Äîcreativity, Fortress Press, 2004, page x,33,57,137, retrieved 3-17-09] It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story. This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as God's native tongue.evolutionary evangelist retrieved 2009-02-01 Eric Chaisson orients his view of the epic around an \\"arrow of time\\",Two movies: Arrow of Time and Cosmic Origins which he divides into 'Seven Ages of the Cosmos': particulate, galactic, stellar, planetary, chemical, biological, and cultural.Chaisson ‚Äì Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos, 2006Cosmic Evolution However, such a thermodynamic arrow is not intended to be directional, a common misunderstanding; he sees no purpose, plan, or design in evolution, which he regards as unceasing, uncaring, and unpredictable. Chaisson's strictly scientific analysis of evolution in its broadest sense‚Äîcosmic evolution)‚Äîimplies a unidirectional, meandering process extending from the Big Bang to humankind on Earth, and continuing while likely producing increasing complexity, perhaps forever, to ends unknown. As a physicist, he is perhaps best known for attempting to quantify the epic of evolution, using the currently known laws of science and the scientific method (with its insistence on experimental tests of all ideas, principally those of energy rate density) in order to empirically discriminate between objective sense and subjective nonsense. What emerges is a grand and inspiring scientific narrative of who we are and whence we came‚Äîthe most recent and up-to-date version of this work having been summarized in a long peer-review article.\\"The Natural Science Underlying Big History,\\" The Scientific World Journal, v 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912. Creation‚Äìevolution controversy The creation‚Äìevolution controversy goes beyond the field of evolutionary biology and includes many fields of science (cosmology, geology, paleontology, thermodynamics, physics and sociobiology).Mark Isaak (2006), \\"An Index to Creationist Claims\\", TalkOrigins Archive. Although in the scientific community there is essentially universal agreement that the evidence of evolution is overwhelming, and the consensus supporting the neo-Darwinian evolutionary synthesis is nearly absolute,Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover page 83 creationists have asserted that there is a significant scientific controversy and disagreement over the validity of the evolution epic. The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion. However, as the National Academy of Sciences states: John Haught, Roman Catholic theologian, in his Science and Religion: from Conflict to Conversation suggests a theistic acceptance of the Epic. He says contemporary theology is being changed by evolutionary science. There are many versions undergoing constant revision. He considers evolution to be, at least provisionally, a most appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today and deplores that contemporary theology gets hung up in the creationism controversy.John F. Haught ‚Äì Science and Religion: from conflict to conversation, Paulist Press, 1995, page 69, There are liberal congregations these days that may see the epic of evolution as a history about life and the universe that is both scientific and sacred. The profoundly sacred elements of the story warm up the cold technical facts with awe and reverence, giving Nature an inspiring beauty.The Epic of Evolution ‚Äì A sermon by Douglas Taylor retrieved 3-15-09 Eric Chaisson, in his book, Epic of Evolution, concludes that the coherent story of cosmic evolution‚Äîa powerful and noble effort‚Äîmay perhaps be the way to ethical evolution in the new millennium.Eric Chaisson ‚Äì Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos, Columbia University Press, 2006, page 442, retrieved 3-23-09 Although his is a decidedly materialistic view of the evolutionary epic, he recognizes more than most scientists that humanity is part of this grand story and that we have a responsibility to survive as the only sentient, intelligent beings known in the universe. Not all of the Epic's advocates are distinguished scientists. Some are Christians who consider it a 'narrative of mythic proportions' that contain religious aspects. They see it as a multifaceted concept that has been in Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy, transcendence, purpose and morality. However, there are both humanists and creationists who dispute this stance, making unclear the many varied theological stories of our world.Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley ‚Äì The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Wm.

The series aired on NBC for two seasons, from 1963 to 1965. It won a Peabody Award in 1963. Overview The series follows John Novak, an idealistic first-year English teacher at Jefferson High School in Los Angeles who often got involved in the lives of his students and fellow teachers. Principal Albert Vane was played by Dean Jagger (he was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1964 and 1965 for his performance). Jagger left the series in 1964 after forty-four episodes, and it was explained that his character was elected California Superintendent of Public Instruction; Burgess Meredith played the new principal, Martin Woodridge, for the remaining seventeen episodes. The series showcased many popular actors of the time including Martin Landau, Walter Koenig, Beau Bridges, Tony Dow, Ed Asner, June Lockhart, Sherry Jackson, and many others. This trendsetting show was the first to depict both teachers and students in a dramatic and realistic manner and was very influential on the educational community. Many cutting-edge themes were showcased including racial discrimination, cheating on exams, anti-Semitism, alcoholism, dropouts, drug abuse and political extremism. In its two-year run, the program won over 47 awards from various educational institutions including the National Education Association and was the recipient of a prestigious Peabody Award for excellence.Harter, Chuck.

It is part of the Lincoln Village subdivision and is colloquially known as Lincoln Village. It is bounded by West Broad Street on the north, Sullivant Avenue on the south, South Grener Avenue on the east, and Redmond and Hiler Roads on the west. It is in Prairie Township, and the ZIP Code 43228. History Lincoln Village was built in the late 1950s as part of a new neighborhood concept in which suburbs were built near factories and would include local schools and strip malls of stores which would support the families. It was written up in a major article in Life Magazine about 1960 as the wave of the future. Lincoln Village was built near the Columbus factories for Westinghouse and General Motors. The model homes for Lincoln Village were the first few homes on the west side of Redmond Road. The development is newer than the homes on roads to its west from Woodlawn Avenue to New Rome and from South Grener Avenue to I-270. Another highlight of the neighborhood was the well-known Lincoln Lodge Motel which included a golf course which was at the northwest corner of North Murray Hill Road and West Broad Street. The general area is home to several older buildings, and contains apartment complexes and stores. Popular stores in or near the neighborhood are KFC, CVS, and the Home Depot. Lincoln Village South is home to Stiles Elementary School. Stiles is home to children from Lincoln Park, Murray Hill, and Cherry Creek. The school has been criticized recently because it was found that during the 2005‚Äì2006 school year, 31% of the children at Stiles could not speak English. Stiles is 26% Hispanic, 25% African-American, 44% White, and 5% mixed races. This is a huge change from the all white WASP neighborhood it was in the 1960s. Stiles has played a large role in the history and story of the neighborhood. Crime Like most West Columbus neighborhoods, Murray Hill has problems with crime. It receives policing from the Columbus Division of Police Precinct 10, Franklin Township Police Department, and the Franklin County Sheriff's Department. Gangs in Murray Hill include the 4:20 High Rydas, divisions of both the Blood and Crip gangs, and various Hispanic gangs.

Lay Dominicans are men and women, singles and couples living a Christian life with a Dominican spirituality in the secular world. They find inspiration following the same spiritual path taken by many saints, blesseds, and other holy men and women throughout the 800-year history of the Dominican Order. The Life of a Dominican layperson is all about having a passion for the Word of God. It is about committing one self to a community of like minded brothers and sisters that immerse themselves in the Word of God. There are Lay Dominican Provinces all around the world.  History  =Origin= This was one of the earliest developments of the ancient Ordo de Poenitentia (Order of Penance). This was a status which developed in the ancient Church, in which those faithful who sought a more dedicated way of life embraced the lifestyle of a penitent then in effect in the Church. It was not the organization from which the Friars Preachers evolved, but rather represents that portion of the Order of Penance which came under Dominican influence. At first vaguely constituted and living without system or form, its members gradually grew more and more dependent on their spiritual guides. Friar Munio of Zamora, the seventh Master General of the Friars Preachers, formulated a definite Rule for these lay penitents in 1285. By this the Ordo de Poenitentia was to be ruled in each local center by a Dominican priestFederici, \\"Istoria de cavalieri Gaudenti\\", Venice, 1787, Codex Diplomaticus. and was to be subject to the obedience of the Dominican priors provincial and Masters General. Henceforward this branch was linked to the fortunes of the Friars Preachers and wore their habits of black and white (with few minor differences varying according to time and country). They were not specifically called a third order until after papal recognition in 1405.Mandonnet, \\"Les r√®gles et le gouvernement de l'ordo de Poenitentia\\", Paris, 1902, p. 207. but continued to be known as the \\"Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St. Dominic\\". A military order, called the Militia Jesu Christi (soldiery of Jesus Christ), also became a part of the third order. It owed its origin to Bishop Foulques of Toulouse, Simon de Montfort, and probably to St. Dominic, then a canon regular. This connection with the founder of the Friars Preachers is first discussed in documents relating to the Blessed Raymund of Capua, who became a Dominican about 1350. As early as 1235, Pope Gregory IX confided the Militia to the care of Friar Jordan of Saxony, second Master General, by a Bull of 18 May; and in the same year he decreed a habit of black and white for the knights. Further, when the Militia was brought across the Alps and established in Italy, it is found to be always connected with some Dominican church. Lastly, it was very largely influenced by a famous Dominican, Friar Bartolomeo of Braganza, or of Vicenza, as he is sometimes called. Originally working side by side and independent of each other, because both received the same spiritual administration of the Friars Preachers, they appear to have been merged at the close of the 13th century. So too their ultimate merging is hinted at by Honorius III in 1221 when he designates the Militia \\"nomine poenitentiae\\", and a comparison also of the rules of the two institutions: that of Pope Gregory for the Militia in 1235 and that of Munio de Zamora for the Order of Penance of St. Dominic in 1285 would lead one to the same conclusion. The only considerable difference that could be cited against this identify is that Munio of Zamora expressly forbids the carrying of arms. But this is in reality but a further proof of their approximation, for he allows for the one exception which could possibly apply to the Militia, viz. in defence of the Church. This amalgamation is admitted by the Bollandists to have become general in the 14th century.Acta Sanctorum, August, I, 418-422. From this double movement therefore, i.e. from the Ordo de Poenitentia S. Dominici and the Militia Jesu Christi, was born the modern Third Order of St. Dominic. Though its source is therefore anterior to the First Order, its full perfection as an organized society, with a distinctive habit, a definite rule, and a declared ethos or spirit, is due to the genius of the children of St. Dominic. They took an ancient institution, and, with their characteristic love of order and systematic arrangement, brought it into something compact and symmetrical. From them this idea of subjection to a First Order was taken up by the Franciscans and has been adopted by all subsequent Third Orders =Reformation= Only for one period in its history was there any real fear of suppression. Many held that the condemnation passed on the Beguines and Beghards at the Council of Vienna in 1312 applied no less to the Orders of Penance. In consequence the master-general petitioned Pope John XXII in 1326 to settle definitely the difficulty. As a result, he answered by a Bull of 1 June 1326 (Cum de Mulieribus), which is a long eulogium on the work of the Dominican Third Order. After the plague of 1348, a great deal of laxity and disorganization crept into the Third Order, but a wonderful throng of saints soon caused its rejuvenation. The influence of St. Catherine of Siena gave a powerful impetus to the movement in Italy and her work was carried on by Bl. Clara Gambacorta (died 1419) and Bl. Maria Mancini (died 1431). This new spiritual vigour reached across the Alps to the sisterhoods of Germany, where the effect was almost abnormal (Heimbucher, \\"Die Orden und Kongregationen der katholischen Kirche\\", Paderborn, 1907, II, 169-177). But there has never been any reform in the sense of a separate organization with a change of rule or habit. As in the First Order, there has been a peculiar gift of unity which has enabled it to last undivided for seven hundred years. Spirit  The work of the Third Order is to engage laypeople to help in reform of church discipline. Its initial purpose was the preaching of penance; but under Dominican influences it leaned to the intellectual aspect of the Faith and based its message to the world on the exposition of the Creed; it was to reform Church discipline by the more widespread knowledge of the mysteries of faith. It also helped to defend the Church, and to develop the communion of prayer. The medieval ideal of Christ's Mystical Body which has captivated all spiritual-minded people implies a harmony of prayer. To achieve this end the contemplative and monastic orders were begun; and the Third Order of St. Dominic endeavours to link pious souls to this great throng of religious (Proctor, \\"The Dominican Tertiary's Daily Manual\\", London, 1900, 15-20). Divisions The Third Order as it exists to-day can be divided into two categories: regular, i.e. comprising Tertiaries, whether men or women, who live in community and wear the habit externally; and secular, i.e. whether married or single, cleric or lay, who live their lives like others of their profession, but who privately take up practices of austerity, recite some liturgical Office, and wear some symbol of the Dominican habit. The origin of the conventual women Tertiaries has never been very clearly worked out. It is usual to trace them back to Emily Bicchieri, about the year 1255.\\"Manual of Third Order of St. Dominic\\", London, 1871, 9. But if the view taken above of the origin of the Third Order in the Ordo de Poenitentia be correct, we are forced to the conclusion that the communities of women established by St. Dominic at Prouille, S. Sisto, etc. were really of this Third Order. Their constitutions, approved first for S. Sisto, though previously observed at Prouille, expressly speak of the nuns as \\"de Poenitentia S. Mariae Magdalenae\\".\\"Analecta Ord. Praed.\\", Rome, 1898, 628 sqq. It would seem then that the Ordo de Poenitentia did not exclude convents of enclosed nuns from its ranks, and this was due probably to St. Dominic himself. Very much later came a conventual order of men, originated by the genius of P√®re Lacordaire. He considered that the democratic spirit of the Dominican Order fitted it especially for the task of training the youth. But he knew how impossible it was for his preaching associates to tie themselves down to schoolwork among boys; as a consequence, he began, in 1852, a Third Order of men, wearing the habit, living in community yet without the burdens of monastic life. The rule was approved provisionally in 1853 and definitely in 1868.For the rule cf. \\"Acta Capituli Generalis Ord. Praed.\\", Rome, 1904, 106 sqq. But by far the greatest portion of the Third Order consists of secular Tertiaries. These are of every rank of society, and represent the old Ordo de Poenitentia and the old Militia. In certain countries they are grouped into chapters, having a lay prior and sub-prior or prioress and sub-prioress, and hold monthly meetings. Since the Rule of Mu√±on de Zamora (1285), they have always been subject to a Dominican priest appointed by the Dominican provincial. For the actual reception of the habit, the master-general can give faculties to any priest. The full habit is the same as that of the members of the First and Second Orders, but without the scapular (granted, however, to communities since 1667). Though the habit is not worn during life many procure it so that they may be buried in the recognized dress of St. Dominic's children. Extent It is practically impossible to obtain, even in a vague way, the number of the secular Dominican Tertiaries. No general register is kept, and the records of each priory would have to be searched. From the time of St. Louis ‚Äî who wished to join the Dominican and Franciscan Orders (Acta Sanctorum, August, V, 545), and is represented in old illuminations, sometimes in the habit of one, sometimes in the habit of the other (Chapotin, Histoire de dominicains de la province de France, Rouen, 1898, p. 497), but probably never joined either‚Äî to our own time, it can be stated only that with the rise and fall of the First Order's greatness rose and fell the number of the Tertiaries. In England during the 13th century very many are said to have become Tertiaries. But of this nothing for certain can be specified. At the time of St. Catherine of Siena, the Mantellate (women secular Tertiaries) made difficulties about receiving her to the habit as they included at the date only widows (Gardner, St. Catherine of Siena, London, 1907, II), and there were no men at all in the Third Order in Italy at that date (Acta Sanctorum, April, III, 1881). Under Bl. Raymond of Capua, her confessor and, after her death, twenty-third master general, attempts were made to re-establish the order and no doubt much was done (Mortier, \\"Ma√Ætres g√©n√©raux\\", III, 605-606). But by the time of St. Antoninus (died 1450) the numbers had again dwindled down to insignificance (\\"Summa Moralis\\", Verona, 1750, III, 23, 5, 5, pp. 1291‚Äì2). Just previous to the Reformation there are a few isolated notices; thus Bl. Adrian Fortescue, the martyr, notes in his diary: \\"Given to the Black Friars of Oxford to be in their fraternity 12d\\" (\\"Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII\\", London, 1883, Rolls Series, VII, 101). But these give us no ground at all for any surmise as to statistics. In the Americas, the first canonized saint (St. Rose of Lima, died 1617) and the first beatified person of mixed-race (St. Martin de Porres, died 1639) were both Dominican Tertiaries, and later in France were men like M. Olier and St. Louis de Montfort. In the United States, Lay Dominican Provinces include the Southern Province, Central Province, Western Province, and Eastern Province. Regular Tertiaries Then came the influence of Lacordaire, from whose time there dates a new enthusiasm in the Third Order (\\"Ann√©e Dominicaine\\", Paris, 1910, 149-65). Of the regular Tertiaries it is easier to speak more definitely. The numbers of all the sixteen approved congregations existing in 1902 are given, and they amount to some 7000 nuns (\\"Analecta Ord. Praed.\\", Rome, 1902, 389). To these must be added another 7000 of congregations not yet definitively authorized by Rome. But many fresh convents were opened and the numbers continually increased. In England they began under Mother Margaret Hallahan (died 1868) in 1842, and now in all the separate groupings there are 22 convents with some 500 sisters; in the United States their success has been remarkable. Founded in 1846 by Mother Amalie Barth (died 1895), the congregation in 1902 included 34 convents and over 2000 nuns. In 1876 they passed into California, where they are rapidly increasing. In Ireland they have many establishments, especially for educational purposes, for their work is as varied as the needs of humanity require. Some are enclosed, others teach, visit the sick, nurse the lepers, look after old people, take care of penitent girls, work among the poor in the slums, etc. As for the congregation of teaching men, they have been greatly disorganized since their expulsion from France. At present they comprise but a half-dozen colleges in Fribourg, San Sebastian, and South America, and do not amount to more than 100 members in all. Finally, a citation from Faber's \\"Blessed Sacrament\\" (2nd ed., p. 565) may be made: \\"Those who are conversant with, indeed who find the strength and consolation of their lives in, the Acts of the Saints well know that there is not a nook in the mystical Paradise of our heavenly spouse where the flowers grow thicker or smell more fragrantly than this order of multitudinous child-like saints. Nowhere in the Church does the Incarnate Word show His delight at being with the children of men in more touching simplicity, with more unearthly sweetness, or more spouse-like familiarity than in this, the youngest family of S. Dominic.\\"  Congregations  * Dominican nuns * Dominican Order  See also  * Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Catholic Encyclopedia: Third Orders ","title":"Third Order of Saint Dominic"},{"id":"7731416","text":"Houston County High School is the name of several schools: *Houston County High School (Alabama), Columbia, Alabama *Houston County High School (Georgia), Warner Robins, Georgia *Houston County High School (Tennessee), Erin, Tennessee ","title":"Houston County High School"},{"id":"7731433","text":"BKX may refer to: * Ticker symbol for Bankers Petroleum Inc. * IATA symbol for Brookings Regional Airport ","title":"BKX"},{"id":"7731437","text":"Clea, published in 1960, is the fourth volume in The Alexandria Quartet series by British author Lawrence Durrell.

It is situated in the Vrbas municipality, in the South Baƒçka District, Vojvodina province. The village has a Serb ethnic majority and its population numbering 4,361 people (2002 census). It has lakes that are full of carp (Zmajevacka jezera) and a large hunting ground with many wild animals. Anglers from all over Serbia come to Zmajevo to fish the carp in Vojvodina. Name In Serbian, the village is known as Zmajevo (–ó–º–∞—ò–µ–≤–æ), in German as Alt-Keer or Altker, and in Hungarian as √ìk√©r (K√©r was the name of one of the Hungarian tribes that occupied this territory). Older Serbian names (that were given to the village only after the end of the First World War) were: Pa≈°iƒáevo (–ü–∞—à–∏—õ–µ–≤–æ), Stari Ker (–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏ –ö–µ—Ä), Ker (–ö–µ—Ä), and Baƒçka Dobra (–ë–∞—á–∫–∞ –î–æ–±—Ä–∞). The current name, Zmajevo, derived from nickname of Serbian poet Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj. History It was recorded first in 1267. During Ottoman rule (16th-17th century), the village of K√©r was populated by Serbs. Germans settled in the village in 1787, but after World War II, as a consequence of the war events, the German population (approximately 2,500 people) was exiled from the village by the communist government.

Nothing is known about his life. His surviving works comprise the fourth volume of Ottaviano Petrucci's influential series of lute music publications, Intabolatura de lauto libro quarto (Venice, 1508). Dalza is referred to as \\"milanese\\" in the preface, so it must be assumed he was either born in Milan, or worked there, or both.Wess, Coelho, Grove. Together with the oeuvres of Francesco Spinacino and Vincenzo Capirola, Dalza's work constitutes an important part of early Renaissance lute music. The surviving pieces comprise 42 dances, nine ricercares, five tastar de corde, four intabulations and a piece called Caldibi castigliano. The dances are arranged in miniature suites. Each of the five pavanes (five alla venetiana, four alla ferrarese) is followed by a saltarello and a piva that are thematically and harmonically related to it. Other groupings include pairs of tastar de corde with a recercar dietro. Some pieces, such as Caldibi castigliano and those titled Calate ala spagnola, show Spanish influence, possibly because of vihuela cultivation in 16th century Italy. Dalza's music is, for the most part, comparatively simple and easy to perform. The composer himself acknowledged the fact in the preface to Petrucci's volume, and promised to publish more complex pieces at a later date. It is currently unknown whether this had been realized. Although contemporaries such as Spinacino and Capirola wrote in a more advanced idiom, Dalza's output is important because it consists almost entirely of original music, not vocal intabulations. Furthermore, Dalza's collection includes the earliest known pavanesBrown, Grove. (described as padoane diverse on the title page), which are also the earliest known variations: all pavane alla venetiana feature harmonic variations with a loosely defined tonic, and pavane alla ferrarese consist of series of open- ended phrases followed by varied repeats: AA'-BB'-CC'-.. etc.Horsley, p. 118-119.Sisman, Grove. These variation forms are sometimes referred to as single-strain and multiple-strain, respectively. Dalza's collection is also one of the very few sources to feature tastar de corde, short introductory preludes. The name translates from Italian to \\"testing of the strings\\". Dalza's pieces are arranged symmetrically by key: G, C, D (with F), C (with E), G. They range from 16 (number 1) to 42 bars (numbers 3 and 4); the material essentially consists of static chords alternating with short fast passages.Fabris, Grove. References  Imogene Horsley.

Raised in a conservative Christian home, she sang from the time she was a young child. Following early success with secular, she has turned her attention to Christian song-writing and singing. Early life She was raised on a hobby farm in Malagash Point, near Truro, Nova Scotia and homeschooled by strict missionary parents. At age ten, her family moved to Manitoba where in 1993 the 11-year-old recorded an album of Christian music. Before that point, she had never watched television nor listened to the radio. In 1998 her family moved again, this time to Florida. In an article in Billboard that ran in February 2007, Striemer told writer Chuck Taylor that her parents \\"were artistic people, hippies going the opposite way to vegetarian farmland. They did a total 360. I was completely unaware of their previous world, and a trusting child who wasn‚Äôt particularly curious. We would play tapes in the car, either classical music or folk bible songs and sermons; that was the only world I knew.‚Äù In a November 21, 2006 interview on CBC Radio's \\"Sounds Like Canada\\", Striemer revealed that she is very protective of her voice. Her diet excludes caffeine, fizzy drinks and very hot / cold items. Concerning her childhood, she reflected on the close ties she had with nature and animals on the farm. While still 5 or 6 she sang with adults in a group. She further stated that she basically knew from an early age she wanted to sing professionally. From Epic to 'S' Records In April 2001, Striemer was signed by Epic Records and completed her first album for them in 2003 which was never released following a shakeup at Epic's parent, Sony BMG. The following year she and her family moved to the rural community of Delhi, Ontario. Conflicted over Epic's shelving of her album, she nonetheless continued performing in the Toronto area where she met her next manager, following a performance at an Indigo Bookstore. Steven Nowack subsequently founded S Records to launch Striemer's career and she was the first artist signed to S Records. Striemer moved to Los Angeles in 2005. S Records solicited the participation of producer Narada Michael Walden, who has the most number one hits of any producer in history, responsible for writing and producing many of the signature hit songs for Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Santana Following a chance meeting with Carlos Santana at a Marin, County, California steakhouse Santana recorded on Striemer's first cd \\"Images\\" on the first single titled \\"Cars\\" \\"Images\\" was released on December 19, 2006 in Canada on the S Records label and was the No. 1 downloaded album in Canada. \\"Cars\\" was released as a single and in his review, Billboard's Taylor described it as \\"the year's most promising melodic debut... A standing ovation of an endorsement... Remember the first time you heard Whitney, Mariah or Celine and recognized a star was born?\\" Media exposure Prominent press about Striemer, in addition to the CBC interview, includes the lead story on the CTV National News the most watched and most prominent nightly newscast in Canada, a front page and a feature story in Canada‚Äôs national newspaper ‚ÄúNational Post,‚Äù features on the CTV national news and ‚ÄúEntertainment Tonight,‚Äù a lifestyle front in Canada‚Äôs ‚ÄúGlobe and Mail,‚Äù and multiple items in Roger Friedman‚Äôs Foxnews.com ‚ÄúFoxlife‚Äù column. Internet marketing In December 2006, S Records offered \\"Cars\\" as a free download on Internet site sympatico.msn.ca. The move thrust Images to become the No. 1 downloaded album in Canada for the final two weeks of the year, topping discs by Sarah McLachlan, U2 and the Beatles. She repeated the achievement the week of January 15, 2007‚Äîafter the free download had expired‚Äîbeating fare from Justin Timberlake, Josh Groban and Gwen Stefani. In a subsequent profile in Billboard, producer Narada Michael Walden told Taylor, \\"Steven [Nowack] is very zealous, so I listened to what he had to say, not taking his pitch overly seriously until I met Naomi and heard her live.

She has the chops, the range, the drive‚Äîand the humility‚Äîto offer a beautiful gift.\\" Images and Green Taylor's description of Striemer's Images the album include the haunting piano-driven title track, which opens with the lyric, \\"I found out today my love has found another/And all the things I did to make you happy won‚Äôt make you happy anymore,\\" as Striemer pleads amid urgent percussion, \\"If I could fight my way back to you/It would only throw me further away.\\" \\"Fall Behind\\" is Striemer's intense take on her lost contract at Epic. She sings, \\"What's happening/I feel the world slipping apart before my eyes,\\" amid an inflamed backdrop of electric guitars and howling vocal of defiance. Shimmering power ballad and first single \\"Cars\\" uses the lyrical allegory of counting passing vehicles as she waits for her AWOL man‚Äîan allusion to universal diligence in the search for love: \\"In life, we wait for that one person that is meant for us,\\" Striemer explains. \\"They may be with someone else now, but you hold out hope that they exist, so you put on a brave face and wait\\". On August 19, 2009, Striemer's The Green Album shot to No. 2 on Canada's Puretracks album download charts after the release on August 18, 2009. It went to No. 1 on the same chart August 20, 2009. In June 2010, Striemer made her debut on the CT20 Christian Radio Charts in Canada debuting at No. 18, moving up a spot to No. 17 the following week and up to No. 11 on June 26, 2010, where she held steady for two weeks with her single \\"Perfect (When I Grow Up)\\" co-written with songwriter Peter Zizzo.  Christian ministry  2012 Striemer released Hope That Breaks the Dark with singles produced by Ed and Scott Cash at Anchor Productions (Chris Tomlin, Kari Jobe, Chris August) in Nashville, TN. The first single 'Earth & Sky' spent 16 weeks in 2013 on the TRAA Charts in Australia and New Zealand and garnered a Top 5 CCM hit in Canada. The song was performed live on Christian Television programs 'The 700 Club' on CBN and 'Hour of Power' which is broadcast to dozens of countries around the world. The second single 'Giving It To God' was performed on Hour of Power and several other talk shows and remained on the Canadian Christian Contemporary charts for several weeks. Striemer became a published author releasing her autobiographical book 'Backstage Pass - The Naomi Striemer Story' in 2013 which became a Best-Seller on Amazon. The book chronicles Naomi's journey through pop music into Christian Contemporary and takes a close look at the moment that changed her life: When a man approached her in a New York City Hip Hop Studio with a dream.

Biography Born in Minas Gerais, Mendes Campos was the son of the physician and writer Mario Mendes Campos and D. Maria Jos√© de Lima Campos. He began his studies at the state capital, continued in Cachoeira do Campo, where the Portuguese teacher, a priest predicted: \\"You will still be a writer,\\" and ended them in S√£o Jo√£o del Rei. He began the study of dentistry, veterinary medicine and law, but did not complete them. His dream of being an aviator did not materialize either. He had a diploma, he liked to joke, only in touch-typing. Still very young, he entered literary life as a member of the Minas Gerais' \\"Generation of 1945\\", together with such writers as Fernando Sabino, Otto Lara Resende, H√©lio Pellegrino, Jo√£o Ettiene Filho, Carlos Castello Branco and Murilo Rubi√£o. In Belo Horizonte, Campos directed the literary supplement of Folha de Minas and worked in his uncle's construction company. He went to Rio de Janeiro in 1945 in order to meet the poet Pablo Neruda, and ended up staying. In Rio were already his best friends from Minas‚ÄîSabino, Otto, and H√©lio Pellegrino. He began to work for the newspapers O Jornal, Correio da Manh√£ (on which he was editor for two and a half years) and Di√°rio Carioca.http://www.releituras.com/pmcampos_bio.asp Paulo Mendes Campos.

He was, for many years, one of three effective cronistas of the magazine Manchete. Admitted to IPASE in 1947 as a building inspector, Campos became editor of that organization and became director of the Rare Books Division of the National Library in Rio de Janeiro. In 1951 he released his first book, A palavra escrita, of poetry. He was married, that same year, to Joan, a woman of English descent, having had two children, Gabriela and Daniel. Paulo Mendes Campos was a reporter and, occasionally, an advertising copywriter. He was also a skillful translator of English and French poetry and prose into Brazilian Portuguese - among others, the works of Jules Verne, Oscar Wilde, John Ruskin, Shakespeare, and Neruda.

Prelude The FARC began their rebel activities in the early 1960s during the National Front years in which bipartisan hegemony controlled and held political power. In an effort to exterminate the armed guerrilla movements the Colombian government aided by the United States launched an attack to destroy the \\"Marquetalia Republic\\" a guerrilla enclave in central Colombia. After this attack the FARC guerrilla retreated to isolated or poor government presence areas and began establishing a parallel state governed by them. The guerrillas began extorting and kidnapping landowners and assaulting local agrarian banks (Caja Agrarias). During the 1980s and 1990s the Colombian drug cartels had increased their power and in some cases had hired the guerrillas such as the FARC and ELN guerrillas to protect illicit cultivations from the government forces. The most powerful of the cartels; the Medell√≠n and Cali Cartels had engulfed in a war with the government. The Medell√≠n Cartel led by Pablo Escobar also became an enemy later of the FARC in a struggle to control the profitable illegal drug trafficking business. Escobar helped create right wing paramilitary groups. The FARC guerrilla used the revenues from taxing drug lords, and cultivation and production of these to finance their rebel activities. On August 18, 1989, the Medell√≠n Cartel assassinated the liberal presidential candidate Luis Carlos Gal√°n. C√©sar Gaviria replaced him and was then elected president of Colombia. Gaviria avenged the death of Galan by dismantling the Medell√≠n Cartel, but the gap left by this organization was quickly filled by the Cali Cartel and the FARC, which began expanding its influence and armed power in the countryside mainly. During the government of Ernesto Samper the opposing candidate Andr√©s Pastrana accused President Samper of financing its campaign with money from the Cali Cartel. The political scandal known as the \\"8000 Process\\" surged and weakened the presidency and government institutions. The United States also conditioned its support for the government, focusing mainly on aiding the military forces on operations against narcotics, that would ultimately help bring down the Cali Cartel. Without any major adversaries in the drug business other than the growing AUC paramilitary group, the FARC gained control of most the drug production and trade, as well as financing its political rhetoric and influence over most of the regions in Colombia. With the weakening of the drug cartels the guerrillas became the main issue affecting Colombia. Andr√©s Pastrana ran for the presidential office again and as a candidate his campaign sustained negotiations with the FARC for a possible peace process. Peace Process Pastrana then appointed Victor G. Ricardo as High Commissioner for Peace and held conversations with Manuel Marulanda Velez (aka Tirofijo) top commander of the FARC on June 15, 1998. On July 9 elected president Pastrana travelled to the mountains of Colombia and personally met with rebel commanders including \\"Tirofijo\\" himself. On October 8 both sides agreed to create a demilitarized zone in the region of El Caguan, a jungle region in south central Colombia made up by the municipalities of Vista Hermosa, La Macarena, La Uribe and Mesetas in Meta Department, and San Vicente del Cagu√°n in Caquet√° Department. On August 7, 1998 Pastrana becomes president of Colombia for the period 1998-2002. On December 14, 1998, the Pastrana administration and the FARC agreed to begin formal peace talks on January 7, 1999. =Demands and proposals= The FARC demanded and proposed certain issues in order to begin; the following were proposed to quell the armed conflict: vision of the conflict, negotiation criteria, preparation of the negotiation, political legitimacy, security, participation, negotiated political settlement, civilian population, recommendations to the civilian population and rules of behavior regarding the masses. The group also considered fundamental topics: democracy, functioning of the state, the public force, social and economic aspects, agrarian reform, natural resources, sovereignty, drug trafficking, paramilitarism and CONVIVIR security groups. On the other hand, the government tried to persuade the FARC to leave the Colombian Army Cazadores Battalion, stationed in the area of El Caguan, but FARC opposed. Victor G Ricardo agreed to withdraw the Battalion without consulting military officials. The government urged the FARC to support projects to manually eradicate illegal crops. =Formal dialogues begin= The then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld meeting with President Andr√©s Pastrana. As planned the formal dialogues began on January 7, 1999, in a ceremony at El Caguan with the presence of President Pastrana, but without the presence of \\"Tirofijo\\". The FARC argued that there was a possible threat to assassinate their commander \\"Tirofijo\\". FARC negotiator Joaqu√≠n G√≥mez acted on behalf of Tirofijo. President Pastrana said that \\"the absence of Manuel Marulanda Velez cannot be a reason to not continue with the instalment of the dialogue to agree on an agenda that will conduct us to peace\\". On January 8, \\"Tirofijo\\" showed up and insisted that there had been a possible assassination attempt.  Frozen dialogues  On January 11, guerrilla commander Jorge Brice√±o threatened to kidnap high-profile people if the government did not comply with FARC's demands for a prisoner exchange. Some years before, the FARC had kidnapped a considerable number of military personnel, high-profile politicians and government officials. Pastrana replied with a threat to end the peace process if the FARC carried out the kidnappings. On January 19 the FARC froze the dialogues that the AUC paramilitary groups were resurging and demanded the government to act against these groups and its supporters within the government. On February 6 President Pastrana extends the duration of the demilitarized zone and sets it to expire on May 7. Three days later, Pastrana and \\"Tirofijo\\" finally met publicly and set a new meeting on February 14 to resume dialogues. The FARC had purportedly frozen the peace talks because of the government's spraying of glyphosate to eradicate illegal crops as stated in the Plan Colombia. Between February 25 and March 11, three American indigenous-rights activists, Terence Freitas, Lahe'ena'e Gay, and Ingrid Washinawatok were abducted by the FARC in Arauca Department and later assassinated. The FARC admitted the assassination and apologized. The Colombian government then accused a high ranking FARC member known as Germ√°n Brice√±o (brother of Jorge Brice√±o) of the assassination and the United States demanded the FARC to hand over the perpetrators. The FARC refused. From April 20 to May 1, both parties met unofficially in El Caguan to discuss the paramilitary issue and the FARC's demands to expand the area of the demilitarized zone, which was due to expire on May 7, and to extend the timeframe. On May 2, President Pastrana travelled to the demilitarized zone and personally met with \\"Tirofijo\\" for a second time. Pastrana convinced him to begin formal peace-talks on May 6. It was agreed that the demilitarized area would remain in size, but its expiration would be postponed. Another decision was to form an International Verification Commission to observe the agreements and the FARC's actions in the area. On May 26, Colombian Minister of Defense, Rodrigo Lloreda resigned after criticising the president's handling of the peace process. Lloreda opposed the indefinite extension of the timeline of the demilitarized area. The High Commissioner for Peace's remarks suggesting an extension of the demilitarized area for the FARC triggered a discontent in some servicemen in the Colombian military; 18 generals also tried to resign but the president only accepted Lloreda's. The head of the armed forces, Gen. Fernando Tapias, offered President Pastrana a public show of support. Pastrana then appointed Luis Fernando Ram√≠rez as Defense Minister. 'Ra√∫l Reyes; Farc negotiator. The Center for International Policy led a delegation of US Congressmen to Colombia. Among the representatives was William Delahunt (D-MA) and six other members of Congress, who met with government officials and representatives of political parties, church groups, peace groups, human rights groups, US government employees stationed in Colombia and the United Nations. On June 4 the delegation of US representatives travelled to El Caguan to meet with rebel leaders. They held talks without results with guerrilla commander Ra√∫l Reyes regarding the drug trade, kidnappings and the assassination of US citizens, specially related to the three US indigenous workers. The government then announced that the formal negotiations with the FARC would begin on July 7. But a day before, both parties postponed the peace talks until July 19 alleging that three of FARC's negotiators could not arrive on time to the meeting, the FARC argued that they also needed more time to organize their positions regarding the International Commission, as agreed between \\"Tirofijo\\" and President Pastrana. Between 8‚Äì12 July the FARC launched an armed offensive (called by them as \\"armed strikes\\" from the ), in which the guerrilla group attacked 15 small towns and targeted infrastructure; mainly commercial banks, bridges and energy infrastructure, random kidnappings (Colloquially called in Colombian ) as well as assaulting numerous National Police small posts. The Military of Colombia, with the help of the U.S. government, counterattacked by bombing guerrilla enclaves using U.S. provided satellite intelligence. On July 15, 1999 Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ram√≠rez and the Colombian General of the Chief of Staff Fernando Tapias requested US$500 million as aid to fund counter-narcotics and counter- insurgency warfare. The then head of the US Office of National Drug Control Policy Barry McCaffrey called for a billion dollar as supplemental assistance for the war on drugs in South America, half of it to be assigned to Colombia.

This involves overseeing the competitions (sheepdog trials) that are held by regional clubs during the year and maintaining the stud book to manage the registration of sheepdogs in South Africa. It also works with the regional clubs in an effort to further the spread of interest in sheepdogs as useful working resources in the life of the stock farmer and to encourage handlers to participate in competition. Competition is seen as a way to maintain the standard of breeding and training of working sheepdogs. History The South African Sheepdog Association was established in 1961 when a group of farmers in the Karoo came together to discuss the future of the sheepdog in South Africa. The inaugural meeting, with 13 members present, was held at Union High School in Graaff Reinet and Mr Bun Kingwill was elected as the first president of the association. During the South African championship of that year, \\"Tess\\" of Mr Billy Kingwill became the first South African champion under the watchful eye of the judge, Mr Henry Hartzenberg of Graaff Reinet. Since the inauguration of SASDA a South African championship has been held each year. Over time the course has also changed, to upgrade the standard and difficulty to improve the dog's working ability. In the beginning the course was very much like the ones used in Australia but gradually changed to the English version. The current course with the double lift, which has been implemented in 2001, has been taken over virtually as is from the one used for the international championship in the United Kingdom and in so doing putting South African dogs and handlers on the same foot as their overseas counterparts. Through the years the South African Sheepdog Association still strives toward its main objective ‚Äì to introduce farmers and other interested people to sheepdogs as a labour saving force. This is done through demonstrations and courses, as well as competitions, where breeding success is tested and the best breeding material selected according to working ability. The previous logo appears on the right. Structure The association is made up of a number of regional clubs, loosely based on the provinces and regions of South Africa, together with a central office responsible for the maintenance of the registration of dogs and breeders. Competition =Dog of the Year= Each club typically holds one trial a year. They normally run for two to three days and are usually arranged in such a way as to give each dog at least two opportunities to compete. Trials that comply with certain standards, including a minimum entry, will be able to advertise as 'Dog of the Year' (DOY) trials. Competitors taking part in these trials will be able to accumulate points towards the DOY competition. =Nationals= Once a year a national trial is held. It is generally referred to as 'The Nationals'. Handlers all compete on the same trial field on an equal footing and after a number of rounds the most successful dog is awarded the title of National Champion. At the same event the dog that has accumulated the most points at 'Dog of the Year' trials since the last Nationals competition is awarded the title of South Africa Dog of the Year. =Categories= During club competition dogs compete in three different categories: juniors, seniors and top dogs. Juniors don't do the more challenging tests of skill like shedding and must win a junior trial to qualify for seniors. To qualify for top dogs a dog must win a senior competition and attain a score of at least 90% of the points on offer on the same run. The course for top dogs is more of a test. It includes narrow drive gates and may include a double lift or some other additional test. =Beginners= Most club trials include a further category: beginners. Any dog can compete in a beginner competition. To qualify for beginner the handler must have never competed in any other trial category. This category was introduced to encourage novices to become part of the family of competitors. International Links SASDA have tried to maintain links with similar organisations in other countries. Over the years several experienced handlers from England, Wales, Scotland and the USA have been invited to come and judge important trials, most often the Nationals. The 2006 Nationals were judged by Dick Roper from England. Most international judges invited to travel to judge trials are also invited to run workshops to encourage the sharing of ideas. South African dogs are not allowed to compete in Europe without first completing six months of quarantine but South African dogs have competed in the USA. In 2005 Faansie Basson and Wally Ward represented South Africa in the USA. At the Meeker Classic Faansie Basson finished 8th in the final with Lad. Handlers have brought dogs from Europe to compete in South Africa in the past. To do this, before they travel to South Africa, they need to arrange to sell the dogs they bring to local handlers after the competition so that they can leave them behind when they leave. Occasionally handlers from neighbouring countries will compete in regional trials although this is more the exception than the rule.

It is the highpoint on the ridge between Harter Fell and Shipman Knotts. Topography The western Kentmere slopes fall over the rough ground of Hallow Bank Quarter to Ullstone Gill, a tributary of the River Kent. Beyond here Smallthwaite Knott, an outlier of Harter Fell, separates Kentmere Pike from the main valley. There is extensive evidence of former quarrying on this flank. By contrast the Longsleddale side wears a rim of crag above the narrow upper course of the River Sprint. Goat Scar, Raven Crag and Brown Crags are the main faces, while Steel Pike appears from the valley bridleway as an independent rocky peak. The remains of the large Wrengill Quarry are just north of here, together with a mine entrance a little higher up the slope. The ridge northwards to Harter Fell drops to a wet depression and then climbs up the grassy ridge, following first the wall and then a broken fence. South-eastwards the ridge continues to the cairned top of Goat Scar, which provides a good viewpoint for the craggy throat of Longsleddale. From here the high ground turns due south to Shipman Knotts. Summit The top of the fell is a grassy dome with a stone wall running along the ridge. An Ordnance Survey column stands just to the east of the wall whilst a small summit cairn has been built to the west. Both are of equivalent height. The view of Lakeland is intermittent between the tops on the Ill Bell ridge, the Coniston fells and a portion of the Scafell group being visible. An open vista to the south encompasses Windermere and Morecambe Bay.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: Ascents Kentmere Pike is most commonly climbed indirectly as part of the Kentmere Horseshoe. This circuit takes in the fine ridges on either side of the valley, together with the higher fells at its head. Direct ascents can also be made from either flank. An ancient grooved path rises up the fellside from the end of High Lane in Kentmere, meeting the ridgetop wall to the south of the summit. From Longsleddale the walled track which leads to Gatesgarth Pass can be left just north of Steel Pike. The line of an old fence is then followed to the ridge.

CUDOS is an Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence and was formally launched in 2003. Funding history CUDOS commenced operation in 2003 as one of the first Australian Research Council Centres of Excellence,ARC Centres of Excellence Selection Report for funding commencing in 2003, Retrieved 2013-07-04 and began with 4 research programs across 7 groups. It continued through 2007 when ARC renewed funding for another 3 years. The latest incarnation is based on new ARC funding from 2011 to 2017, with Australian and international researchers collaborating on 6 new Flagship projects.  Participants  CUDOS is a research consortium between 8 groups at 6 Australian Universities: The University of Sydney (CUDOS headquarters), Australian National University, Macquarie University, University of Technology Sydney, RMIT University and Monash University. The Research Director is Professor Ben Eggleton, with Professor Yuri Kivshar as Deputy Director and Professor Martijn de Sterke as Associate Director.  Aims  CUDOS aims to be the world-leader in research in on-chip photonics, for all-optical signal processing. The centre conducts research to create a world- best on-chip photonic platform for information transfer and processing technologies. CUDOS aims to translate the intellectual capital, which the researchers create to build a community of professionals which can drive wealth creation in Australia. Research CUDOS brings together a powerful team of Australian and international researchers in optical science and photonics technology, and has played a pivotal role in demonstrating ground- breaking integrated photonic signal processors that can massively increase the information capacity of the Internet. The centre currently has six Flagship Projects. Functional Metamaterials and Metadevices: Metamaterials are synthesised on the sub-wavelength scale to have optical properties (refractive index, dispersion) that can differ dramatically from those of bulk materials: perfect lenses, cloaking, and negative refractive index materials are examples. CUDOS aims to develop metamaterials that will enable entirely new ways to control photons. On-chip Nanoplasmonics: The refractive index of metals is very high, so the wavelength of the optical modes is very short. CUDOS is developing novel techniques to fabricate nano-structured composites of metals and optically transmitting materials. They are investigating novel modes of light propagation in these materials and use them to create ultracompact devices like transmission lines and antennae. The vision of this project is to develop three- and two-dimensional nanoplasmonic structures that can allow unprecedented control of light at the sub wavelength scale. Hybrid integration: As metamaterials, nanoplasmonic materials and new kinds of nonlinear optical materials are developed, they need to be integrated with existing optical platforms of silicon or chalcogenide, so that light can pass from one material to another on the same 'chip'. This project aims to develop novel designs for integrating such hybrid materials, and novel fabrication techniques. Mid-Infrared Photonics: The mid-infrared region of the spectrum (3 ‚Äì 10 ¬µm) has enormous potential for highly efficient sensing of molecules significant in agriculture, natural resource management, homeland security, and others. CUDOS developed photonic platforms and novel sources for this region. Nonlinear Quantum Photonics: This research focuses on highly compact approaches based on nonlinear optics to generate single photons. The aim is to achieve this on a chip and create a fully integrated flexible platform to generate these single photons and use them to perform quantum-based processing operations. Terabit per second Photonics: All-optical processing has the potential to replace electronics in many areas of ultrahigh bandwidth communications systems. CUDOS is developing all-optical processors, using nonlinear optics, and investigating new approaches to enable much higher volumes of data to be carried per unit of optical bandwidth. CUDOS research has been working towards optical circuitry which could result in much faster speeds for data transmission.Radio Australia ‚Äì Innovations ‚Äì Slow Light Data.

Specifically, every constant is interpreted as itself, and every function symbol is interpreted as the function that applies it. The interpretation also defines predicate symbols as denoting a subset of the relevant Herbrand base, effectively specifying which ground atoms are true in the interpretation. This allows the symbols in a set of clauses to be interpreted in a purely syntactic way, separated from any real instantiation. The importance of Herbrand interpretations is that, if any interpretation satisfies a given set of clauses S then there is a Herbrand interpretation that satisfies them. Moreover, Herbrand's theorem states that if S is unsatisfiable then there is a finite unsatisfiable set of ground instances from the Herbrand universe defined by S. Since this set is finite, its unsatisfiability can be verified in finite time. However there may be an infinite number of such sets to check. It is named after Jacques Herbrand.

Luigi begins having fits of uncontrollable laughter because Simonetta has rejected him. Tito falls into melancholia because of his conflicted interests about Simonetta. They both see the same doctor about their conditions and meet for the first time. They share their respective troubles and believe they can help each other, not knowing they both love the same woman. Nonetheless, the three eventually develop a strong friendship until Luigi asks Simonetta to marry him. Simonetta eventually accepts Luigi's proposal, which throws Tito into an even deeper melancholy. Simonetta learns of Tito's affections for her before she marries Luigi. She tells Tito she loved him before she loved Luigi, then goes to break her engagement with Luigi. While Simonetta is breaking her engagement, Tito and Simon begin rehearsing some new material for their Flik and Flok act. Tito does not believe Simonetta's love is genuine, but that it is just pity and at the same time, he knows that as her adopted father - it would not be right to have her as his wife. Driven insane by his internal conflict, he decides to practice his new routine from the act without protection. Despite his brother Simon's protests, he continues with the stunt and falls from the highwire. Tito dies from his fall, freeing Simonetta to marry Luigi. =Alternate ending= The film survives in an incomplete print, but the missing footage does not critically affect the storyline. The surviving print seems to end rather abruptly, as the last few seconds of the fadeout are among the lost footage. The alternate happy ending - wherein Tito survives his fall and Simonetta marries Luigi, and they all remain close friends - shot at the studio's insistence, has also been lost. Cast *Lon Chaney as Tito / Flik *Loretta Young as Simonetta *Nils Asther as Count Luigi Ravelli *Bernard Siegel as Simon *Cissy Fitzgerald as Giacinta *Gwen Lee as Lucretia Production =Development= The film is based on the 1923 Broadway stage production Laugh, Clown, Laugh that starred Lionel Barrymore and his second wife Irene Fenwick in the role of Simonetta. The play by David Belasco and Tom Cushing, based on a 1919 story Ridi, Pagliaccio by , ran at the Belasco Theatre from November 28, 1923 to March 1924, for a total of 133 performances. The production also featured Lucille Kahn in a supporting role. MGM delayed production of this film several years, because Chaney had already appeared as a clown character in the 1924 film He Who Gets Slapped and due to speculation that Lionel Barrymore might reprise his role from the stage production. As a substitute, MGM would pair Barrymore with Chaney in West of Zanzibar. =Cast= As a trouping comic stage actor in his youth, Chaney would have been acquainted with clown performers of lesser-known fame. In preparation for this film and He Who Gets Slapped Chaney also studied the clown makeup of circus performers and legendary 19th-century clown stage actors like Joseph Grimaldi and George L. Fox, the latter of Humpty Dumpty fame. The film was said to have been Chaney's favorite of all his roles. This film was Loretta Young's first major movie role, at the age of fourteen. In interviews near the end of her life, she expressed her gratitude toward Chaney for his kindness and guidance, and for protecting her from director Brenon's sometimes harsh treatment. =Music= An eponymous musical theme was written specially for the film. It was seemingly played for audiences in movie theatres [in the minutes before screenings of the movie].https://secondhandsongs.com/work/128089 It became a hit record. Chaney's set musicians played the song at his 1930 funeral. Reception =Critical reception= Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it \\" the perfect example of Chaney's unmatched talent for turning tearjerking melodrama into heartbreaking tragedy.\\" =Accolades= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated 2002 re- score, 2003 release In January 2002, the third annual Young Film Composers Competition sponsored by Turner Classic Movies awarded the right to re-score this film to a college student named Scott Salinas.

AES47 specifies a format for the transmission of digital audio over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. A recommendation is made to refer these timestamps to the SMPTE epoch which in turn provides a reference to UTC and GPS time. It thus provides a way of aligning streams from disparate sources, including synchronizing audio to video, and also allows the total delay across a network to be controlled when the transit time of individual cells is unknown. This is most effective in systems where the audio is aligned with an absolute time reference such as GPS, but can also be used with a local reference.

Proteases of this type are known as intramembrane proteases. The most well-known substrate of gamma secretase is amyloid precursor protein, a large integral membrane protein that, when cleaved by both gamma and beta secretase, produces a short 37-43 amino acid peptide called amyloid beta whose abnormally folded fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Gamma secretase is also critical in the related processing of several other type I integral membrane proteins, such as Notch, ErbB4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, ephrin-B2, or CD44. Subunits and assembly The gamma secretase complex consists of four individual proteins: PSEN1 (presenilin-1), nicastrin, APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective 1), and PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer 2). Recent evidence suggests that a fifth protein, known as CD147, is a non-essential regulator of the complex whose absence increases activity. Presenilin, an aspartyl protease, is the catalytic subunit; mutations in the presenilin gene have been shown to be a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and modulates immune cell activity. In humans, two forms of presenilin and two forms of APH-1 have been identified in the genome; one of the APH homologs can also be expressed in two isoforms via alternative splicing, leading to at least six different possible gamma secretase complexes that may have tissue- or cell type specificity. The proteins in the gamma secretase complex are heavily modified by proteolysis during assembly and maturation of the complex; a required activation step is in the autocatalytic cleavage of presenilin to N- and C-terminal fragments. Nicastrin's primary role is in maintaining the stability of the assembled complex and regulating intracellular protein trafficking. PEN-2 associates with the complex via binding of a transmembrane domain of presenilin and, among other possible roles, helps to stabilize the complex after presenilin proteolysis has generated the activated N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. APH-1, which is required for proteolytic activity, binds to the complex via a conserved alpha helix interaction motif and aids in initiating assembly of premature components. Recent research has shown that interaction of the gamma secretase complex with the Œ≥-secretase activating protein facilitates the gamma cleavage of amyloid precursor protein into Œ≤-amyloid. Cellular trafficking The gamma secretase complex is thought to assemble and mature via proteolysis in the early endoplasmic reticulum. The complexes are then transported to the late ER where they interact with and cleave their substrate proteins. Gamma secretase complexes have also been observed localized to the mitochondria, where they may play a role in promoting apoptosis. Function Gamma secretase is an internal protease that cleaves within the membrane- spanning domain of its substrate proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. Substrate recognition occurs via nicastrin ectodomain binding to the N-terminus of the target, which is then passed via a poorly understood process between the two presenilin fragments to a water-containing active site where the catalytic aspartate residue is located. The active site must contain water to carry out hydrolysis within a hydrophobic environment in the interior of the cell membrane, although it is not well understood how water and proton exchange is effected, and as yet no X-ray crystallography structure of gamma secretase is available. Low-resolution electron microscopy reconstructions have allowed the visualization of the hypothesized internal pores of about 2 nanometres. In 2014, a three-dimensional structure of an intact human gamma- secretase complex was determined by cryo-electron microscopy single-particle analysis at 4.5 angstrom resolution and in 2015 an atomic-resolution (3.4 angstrom) cryo-EM structure was reported. The gamma secretase complex is unusual among proteases in having a \\"sloppy\\" cleavage site at the C-terminal site in amyloid beta generation; gamma secretase can cleave APP in any of multiple sites to generate a peptide of variable length, most typically from 39 to 42 amino acids long, with AŒ≤40 the most common isoform and AŒ≤42 the most susceptible to conformational changes leading to amyloid fibrillogenesis. Certain mutations in both APP and in both types of human presenilin are associated with increased AŒ≤42 production and the early-onset genetic form of familial Alzheimer's disease. Although older data suggested that different forms of the gamma secretase complex could be differentially responsible for generating different amyloid beta isoforms, current evidence indicates that the C-terminus of amyloid beta is produced by a series of single-residue cleavages by the same gamma secretase complex. Earlier cleavage sites produce peptides of length 46 (zeta-cleavage) and 49 (epsilon-cleavage).

Arsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 as a munition workers' team from Woolwich, then in Kent, now southeast London. They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later. They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems meant they were liquidated and reformed. They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the club's financial standing, he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, north London in 1913. After the First World War he arranged for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances. It was not until the appointment of Herbert Chapman in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success; Chapman modernised and reformed the club's practices and tactics, and under him and his successor George Allison (who took over after Chapman's death in January 1934), Arsenal won five First Division titles and two FA Cups in the 1930s. After the Second World War, Tom Whittaker continued the success, leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup. After Whittaker's death Arsenal's fortunes gradually declined; by 1966, they were in mid-table obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years. This led to the dismissal of Billy Wright as manager in 1966, and with it the appointment of Bertie Mee, who would go on to turn around the club's fortunes. Early years (1886‚Äì1910) 1888‚Äì89 season Arsenal were founded as Dial Square in 1886 by a group of workers employed by the Dial Square workshop at the Royal Arsenal, an armaments factory in Woolwich, Kent (formally part of the new County of London from 1889). They were led by a Scotsman, David Danskin, who purchased the club's first football, and Jack Humble. Among their number was the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Fred Beardsley, who would later along with Morris Bates obtain a set of red kits from his old club, thus giving Arsenal the colours they still wear today. Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers on an open field on the Isle of Dogs, which they won 6‚Äì0. The club were renamed Royal Arsenal soon after, reportedly on Christmas Day. Initially the club played on Plumstead Common, but soon sought alternative homes, firstly the Sportsman Ground in Plumstead before moving to the adjacent Manor Ground in 1888. Unhappy with the Manor Ground's poor facilities, the club moved to the nearby Invicta Ground in 1890, before returning to the Manor Ground three years later as the Invicta Ground's rent proved too expensive. During this period, Royal Arsenal started to win local trophies, winning both the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889‚Äì90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890‚Äì91; they also entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1889‚Äì90. However, the gulf between Arsenal and the professional sides from the North soon became apparent, and Arsenal faced the threat of their amateur players being lured away by the money professional sides could offer; after Derby County had played Arsenal in an FA Cup tie in 1891, they attempted to sign two of Arsenal's amateur players on professional contracts. Royal Arsenal's move to professionalism in 1891 was frowned upon by many of the amateur southern clubs, and they were banned from participating in local competitions by the London Football Association. With friendlies and the FA Cup the only matches available for Royal Arsenal, they attempted to set up a southern equivalent of The Football League, but the move failed. The club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 when it formed a limited liability company to raise capital to purchase the Manor Ground. Woolwich Arsenal's future looked bleak until the Football League came to their rescue by inviting them to join in 1893. Arsenal were the first Southern club to enter the League, initially joining the Second Division; in response, some of the club's amateur players who rejected professionalism and wanted a workers' team to represent just the Royal Arsenal, broke away to form a short-lived alternative side, Royal Ordnance Factories. Newcastle United (in striped shirts) in an FA Cup semi-final ‚Äì the club's first ‚Äì at the Victoria Ground, Stoke on 31 March 1906; Newcastle won 2‚Äì0. Woolwich Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons, and generally occupied mid-table before the appointment of Harry Bradshaw as manager in 1899; Bradshaw and his star signings, including goalkeeper Jimmy Ashcroft (Arsenal's first England international) and captain Jimmy Jackson, won promotion to the First Division in 1903‚Äì04. However, Bradshaw moved on to Fulham in May 1904, before the Gunners had kicked a ball in the top flight. Despite some strong performances in the FA Cup ‚Äì the club reached the semi-finals in 1905‚Äì06 and 1906‚Äì07 ‚Äì Arsenal were never able to challenge for the League title, only twice finishing above tenth place in the First Division between 1904 and 1913. The cause of this decline was the club's ongoing financial problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then on the outskirts of urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low. To stay afloat, Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell. By the end of the decade the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of what it had been in 1904. The club were close to bankruptcy, and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris, who was also the chairman of Fulham. Move to Highbury and the promotion controversy (1910‚Äì25) 1920‚Äì21 season, the club's best under Leslie Knighton, finishing ninth in the First Division. Norris was acutely aware of the problems associated with Woolwich Arsenal's location, and was desperate to improve the club's income. First, Norris tried to merge Woolwich Arsenal with his other club, Fulham. When that was blocked by the Football League, Norris abandoned the merger and looked to move the club elsewhere, eventually picking a site in Highbury, north London. Despite objections both from Woolwich-based fans and residents of Highbury, Norris tenaciously saw the move through. He reportedly spent ¬£125,000 ( Historic Opportunity cost of that project is ¬£12,530,000, Labour cost of that project is ¬£42,450,000, Economic cost of that project is ¬£88,070,000According to the RPI Calculator at: ) on building the new stadium, designed by Archibald Leitch, on a divinity college's playing fields. Woolwich Arsenal moved there in the 1913 close season, having finished bottom and relegated to the Second Division in 1912‚Äì13. They replaced the \\"Woolwich\\" in their name with \\"The\\" in April 1914, finally becoming plain \\"Arsenal\\" in November 1919, although the press at the time continued to refer to them as \\"The Arsenal\\" and some still do. The move to Highbury brought about much larger crowds; the average attendance in Arsenal's first season at the new ground was 23,000 (compared to 11,000 at the Manor Ground) and rose further after promotion in 1919, finally warding off the spectre of financial ruin. The club controversially rejoined the First Division in 1919, despite only finishing sixth in 1914‚Äì15, the last season of competitive football before the First World War had intervened ‚Äî although an error in the calculation of goal average meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth, an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1975. The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22, and the two new entrants were elected at an AGM of the Football League. On past precedent the two places would be given to the two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated, namely Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Instead one of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea - who had been the victims of a betting controversy - and a ballot was called for the remaining place. The candidates included 20th-placed Tottenham Hotspur and, from the second division, Barnsley (who had finished third); Wolves, (fourth); Birmingham (fifth later amended to sixth); Hull City (seventh); and Nottingham Forest (eighteenth). The League voted to promote sixth-placed Arsenal, for reasons of history over merit; Norris argued that Arsenal be promoted for their \\"long service to league football\\", having been the first League club from the South. The League board agreed; Arsenal received 18 votes, Tottenham 8. Barnsley 5, Wolves 4 with a further 6 votes shared between the other clubs. According to Soar and Tyler, the announcement of the vote seemed to catch all the clubs, except Arsenal, unawares and the affair is a major contributing factor to the rivalry which has fuelled the long-standing enmity between the two North London clubs. There is also an inconsistency in the argument - if \\"long service to league football\\" was the criterion for promoting Arsenal instead of Tottenham then Wolves, who finished two points ahead of Arsenal and were founder members of the Football League, would appear to have a stronger claim. It has been alleged that this was due to backroom deals or even outright bribery by Sir Henry Norris, colluding with his friend John McKenna, the chairman of Liverpool and the Football League, who recommended Arsenal's promotion at the AGM. No conclusive proof of wrongdoing has come to light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he was found to have misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus. Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919, Arsenal have remained in the top division since then, and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of top- flight football. There appear to be no extant records of the meetings which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different reason for their election in that year. The site argues that the match fixing issues of the final year of football before the war (1914‚Äì15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of whose players had been found guilty of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division. The club's return to the First Division was not immediately successful. Under Leslie Knighton, the club never finished better than ninth, and in 1923‚Äì24 came close to returning to the Second Division, finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone. Arsenal did no better the following season, finishing 20th (although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time, being seven points clear of the relegation places), which was the last straw for Norris; he fired Knighton in May 1925, and appointed the Huddersfield Town manager, Herbert Chapman in his place. The Chapman era (1925‚Äì34) Herbert Chapman's achievements are commemorated by a bronze bust inside the marble hall of Arsenal Stadium. Chapman reformed many of the club's practices, including modernising the training and physiotherapy regimes, adding numbers to the players' shirts in August 1928, and changing the team's colours, adding white sleeves to the red shirt in March 1933. Chapman also insisted on journalists dropping the definite article from the club's name, becoming just \\"Arsenal\\", and he successfully campaigned for the renaming of the local Tube station, Gillespie Road, to Arsenal. At the same time, Chapman had a large transfer budget by virtue of Arsenal's improved revenue from their new stadium and a change of heart from Henry Norris; previously a highly prudent chairman, Norris now dictated that there was to be heavy spending on new players. This led to Arsenal becoming known as the Bank of England club. Chapman's first signing was veteran Charlie Buchan from Sunderland; as well as his contributions on the pitch, Buchan would play an important part off it. After Arsenal were beaten 7‚Äì0 by Newcastle United in October 1925, Buchan suggested a change to the formation to adapt to a relaxation of the offside law, adjusting Arsenal's formation to the \\"WM\\", strengthening the defence by pushing the centre half back into defence and the full-backs out to the wings. Over time, Chapman developed the formation further, putting an emphasis on a pacey forward line, wingers cutting inside, and the role of a creative ball-playing midfielder. Arsenal came second in Chapman's first season, their best finish at that time, but this proved to be a false dawn; for the next few seasons they stayed in mid-table as Chapman took his time to assemble his side, slotting new signings such as winger Joe Hulme, forward Jack Lambert and defenders Tom Parker and Herbie Roberts into his new formation. In 1926‚Äì27, Arsenal reached their first FA Cup final, only to lose 1‚Äì0 to Cardiff City, after Arsenal's goalkeeper Dan Lewis let a harmless-looking shot slip through his arms and into the net; it was the only occasion in history that the FA Cup has been won by a club from outside England. Chapman was not deterred, and continued to build his side, signing future captain Eddie Hapgood, as well as three of the club's great attacking players, David Jack, Alex James and Cliff Bastin; it was especially Alex James, Arsenal's playmaker in midfield, supplying the forward line and wingers, who became celebrated as the engine of the team. Three years after their first Cup final, in 1929‚Äì30, Arsenal reached Wembley again, this time up against Chapman's old club Huddersfield Town. The match was notable for being \\"buzzed\\" by the enormous German airship Graf Zeppelin. Arsenal were not distracted from their task; they won 2‚Äì0 with goals from James and Lambert to bring home the club's first major trophy. On 30 August 1930, Arsenal helped create a new attendance record of 28,723 at Blackpool's Bloomfield Road ground. They helped set it again over the next two seasons with crowds of 29,576 and 30,218. Their FA Cup success was the first in a decade in which Arsenal were the dominant club in England. They won the First Division for the first time in 1930‚Äì31; Arsenal performed strongly in a free-scoring title race with Aston Villa, recording several heavy wins (including 7‚Äì1 against Blackpool, 7‚Äì2 v Leicester City, and 9‚Äì1 v Grimsby Town, which remains a club record for the top flight). Arsenal won the title with two games to spare and finished the season having scored 127 league goals (another club record), though Aston Villa managed to score 128, which is still a record for the most goals in an English top flight season. Over The Line Final\\" ‚Äì Newcastle United's Jimmy Richardson crosses the ball back into the Arsenal penalty area, setting up Jack Allen to score; the ball however was fully over the goal-line at the time and thus out of play. Newcastle went on to win 2‚Äì1. The following season, 1931‚Äì32, Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United. Arsenal had led 1‚Äì0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser came after a long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again in the second half to win the match 2‚Äì1. Arsenal's pain was compounded by the fact that Everton had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the 1931‚Äì32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift. Arsenal bounced back the following season, winning their second League title. Arsenal had started the season weakly, but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa, whom they beat 5‚Äì0 at Highbury in April to clinch the title. By this time Chapman's first set of signings had started to show their age so with an eye to the future Chapman promoted George Male to the first team to replace Tom Parker, and signed Ray Bowden to take over from David Jack. The only blot on the club's record was an infamous loss to Walsall of the Third Division North in the FA Cup; five of the first team were out with injury or flu and had their place taken by reserves, and without them Arsenal lost 2‚Äì0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time. One of the stand-ins, Tommy Black, was particularly to blame (conceding a penalty for Walsall's second), and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was transferred to Brentford a week later. A hat-trick of League titles (1934‚Äì39) Arsenal Stadium's East Stand, which was built in 1936 Arsenal had started the 1933‚Äì34 season solidly, but in January 1934 Herbert Chapman died suddenly from pneumonia. Despite this, under caretaker manager Joe Shaw Arsenal retained the title that season. Hulme and James were both out with injury for a large portion, and so Arsenal were not the attacking side they had been the previous season, scoring only 75 in the League, compared with 118 in 1932‚Äì33. George Allison (who had formerly been a director of the club) took over the job of team manager in summer 1934 and soon signed new blood for the side, including wing halves Jack Crayston and Wilf Copping (whose signings had been initiated by Chapman), and striker Ted Drake. With these new signings, Allison oversaw the completion of a hat-trick of League titles in 1934‚Äì35, and Arsenal were back to their attacking best; Drake scored a club record 42 league goals that season and Arsenal racked up a series of heavily one-sided scorelines reminiscent of the 1930‚Äì31 season (including 7‚Äì0 v. Wolves, 8‚Äì1 v. Liverpool, and 8‚Äì0 twice, v. Leicester City and v. Middlesbrough). Such was Arsenal's strength that in November 1934, seven players that started for the England side that beat World Champions Italy 3‚Äì2 (in the so-called \\"Battle of Highbury\\") were on Arsenal's books, a record number of players from a single club, which still stands today. Arsenal's ongoing success attracted larger and larger crowds. Arsenal's home, Highbury, was completely redeveloped, with Leitch's stands from 1913 demolished and replaced with modern Art Deco stands, parts of which remain to this day ‚Äî the fa√ßade of the East Stand is now a Grade II listed building, and both fa√ßades have been retained as part of the modern-day redevelopment of Highbury into an apartment complex. Meanwhile, the North Bank and Clock End terraces had roofs installed. The new stadium saw its largest attendance, 73,295, on 9 March 1935 for a match against Sunderland. Arsenal's dominance of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 1935‚Äì36, winning 1‚Äì0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake. Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934‚Äì35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme. Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in 1937‚Äì38, pipping Wolves on the final day of the season, to cap off a highly successful decade. The Second World War (1939‚Äì45) Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, all first-class football in Britain was suspended, and the 1939‚Äì40 Football League season annulled. Highbury was requisitioned as an ARP station, with a barrage balloon operating behind the Clock End. During the Blitz, a bomb fell on the North Bank, destroying the roof and setting fire to the scrap that was being stored on the terrace. With Highbury closed, Arsenal instead played their home matches at White Hart Lane, home of their rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Wartime matches do not count in official statistics; competitions were played on a regional basis and teams often did not complete a full season; many footballers served in the armed forces as trainers or instructors and were away from their clubs for long periods of time, so they would often star as \\"guests\\" at other clubs. Arsenal won the Football League War Cup South in 1942‚Äì43 and the London or Southern league titles in 1939‚Äì40, 1941‚Äì42 and 1942‚Äì43. Participation in the London League led to their expulsion from The Football League in 1941 along with 14 other clubs; it was not until April 1942 when they were readmitted after expressing regret and paying a ¬£10 fine. In November 1945, with league competition still suspended, Arsenal were one of the teams that played a Dynamo Moscow side touring the UK. With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces, Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players, including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen, which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an England XI, although three of the side were actually Welsh. In any case, Dynamo themselves had Vsevolod Bobrov on loan from CDKA Moscow. The match, at White Hart Lane, kicked off in thick fog and the slick and technically proficient Dynamo won 4‚Äì3, after Arsenal had led 3‚Äì1 at half-time. Though the score is generally agreed upon, after that accounts of the match diverge; even the identity of the goalscorers is disputed. English reports alleged Dynamo fielded twelve players at one point, and tried to pressurise the referee into abandoning the match when they had been behind; in turn, the Soviets accused Arsenal of persistent foul play and even alleged George Allison had bet money on the result (a claim that was later retracted). The acrimony after the match was such that it inspired George Orwell to write his 1945 essay The Sporting Spirit, in which he famously opined on the nature of sport, namely that in his view \\"it is war minus the shooting\\". With the fog obscuring much of the action, not to mention the language barriers and the early-Cold War mutual suspicion between both sides, it is unlikely any reliable account of the match will emerge. Nine Arsenal players died in the Second World War; William Parr, Harry Cook, Herbie Roberts, Cyril Tooze, Bobby Daniel, Hugh Glass, Bill Dean, Sidney Pugh, and Leslie Lack. The post-war years (1945‚Äì66) crest in 1949, which was a familiar sight until its replacement in 2002. The war had claimed the lives of nine Arsenal first team players, the most of any top flight club, and the intervening time had cut short the careers of several others, including Bastin and Drake. Additionally, the debts from the construction of Highbury and the costs of repairing war damage were a heavy financial burden, and Arsenal struggled at first when competitive football resumed in 1946. They lost 6‚Äì1 on aggregate to West Ham United in the third round of the 1945‚Äì46 FA Cup, and upon the league's resumption in 1946‚Äì47 the club finished 13th, their worst in 17 years. George Allison decided to retire from football at the end of that season, and was replaced by his assistant Tom Whittaker, a long-time servant of the club who had been trainer under Chapman. Whittaker enjoyed immediate success, winning the League title in 1947‚Äì48; led by captain Joe Mercer's strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke, Arsenal were top of the table from October until the season's climax, winning by a seven-point margin. However, given the age of the Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were Denis and Leslie Compton), long-term success was not possible. In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman, Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton. Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title, with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 1949‚Äì50, with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 2‚Äì0 win over Liverpool. The 1951‚Äì52 season saw the club nearly win the Double, but ultimately end up empty-handed; a series of injuries and a fixture pile-up at the end of the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches, including the title decider against eventual champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the season; after losing 6‚Äì1, the Gunners finished third, equal on points with Tottenham. A week later, Arsenal played Newcastle United in the 1952 FA Cup Final, with several recovering players rushed back into the first team; Walley Barnes was taken off injured with a twisted knee after 35 minutes (no substitutes were allowed then), and ten-man Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton, Roper and Daniel, so that by the end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch; with the numerical advantage in their favour, Newcastle won 1‚Äì0 with a goal from George Robledo. Despite the disappointment of the previous season, Arsenal won their seventh League title in 1952‚Äì53; in one of the closest title races, they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points. The title looked to be Preston's after Arsenal lost to them 2‚Äì0 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season, but Arsenal came from behind to beat Burnley 3‚Äì2, to take the title on 0.099 of a goal. That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for seventeen years, as Arsenal's fortunes began to wane, particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956. As the club's fortunes declined, they found themselves unable to attract many stars (Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception), while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs. Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in 1958‚Äì59 and fifth in both 1955‚Äì56 and 1956‚Äì57, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table. Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup ‚Äî after reaching the final in 1951‚Äì52, Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter-finals again until 1970‚Äì71. To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960‚Äì61. In 1962, Arsenal made the bold but ultimately unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain Billy Wright as manager, despite his lack of managerial experience and the fact he had no prior experience with the club. Like his two immediate predecessors, Wright was not very successful, although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in European competition, in the 1963‚Äì64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after finishing seventh in 1962‚Äì63. In his final season, Arsenal finished 14th, their lowest position in 36 years, and recorded the lowest attendance at Highbury ‚Äî 4,554 in a match against Leeds United on 5 May 1966. The only Arsenal player to figure in England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning squad was George Eastham, who did not play at all during the tournament. Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966, and was replaced by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee. Though the club's directors did not know it at the time, Mee would turn around the club and lead them to success both in Europe and at home within the next five years.

Following Bertie Mee's appointment in 1966, Arsenal won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, their first European trophy, in 1969‚Äì70, and their first League and FA Cup double in 1970‚Äì71. The Double-winning side, however, was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses: Arsenal lost three FA Cup finals (1971‚Äì72, 1977‚Äì78, and 1979‚Äì80) and the 1979‚Äì80 Cup Winners' Cup final on penalties. The club's only success during this time was an FA Cup win in 1978‚Äì79 against Manchester United. After stagnation in the 1980s, the return of former player George Graham as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory. Arsenal won the League Cup in 1986‚Äì87, the Football League Centenary Trophy in 1988, two League title wins in 1988‚Äì89 and 1990‚Äì91, the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1992‚Äì93 and a second European trophy, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1993‚Äì94. However, Graham's reputation was tarnished when it was revealed that he had taken kickbacks for signing certain players and he was sacked in 1995. Arsenal fifth period of success came with the appointment of Ars√®ne Wenger in 1996. Under him, Arsenal won a second league and cup double in 1997‚Äì98 and then a third in 2001‚Äì02. In addition, the club were victorious in the 2002‚Äì03 and 2004‚Äì05 FA Cups, and won the Premier League in 2003‚Äì04 without losing a single match. In 2005‚Äì06 became the first London club to reach the UEFA Champions League Final, and lost 2‚Äì1 against FC Barcelona. During the following close season, they left their longstanding home of Highbury to the new Emirates Stadium nearby. Their new home would unfortunately see a trophy drought for the next seven years. The Emirates Stadium would have something to celebrate as Arsenal would win 3 FA Cups for the next four seasons.  The first Double (1966‚Äì76)  Following the dismissal of Billy Wright in the summer of 1966, Arsenal appointed physiotherapist Bertie Mee as his successor. The move that brought surprise to some, not least Mee himself, who requested that he be able to return to his old role as physio if being manager had not worked out after 12 months. With assistant Dave Sexton, Mee brought a more professional approach to the club and promoted talent from within; Arsenal's youth team had won the FA Youth Cup in 1966, and talented attacking players such as Charlie George, John Radford, Peter Simpson and Ray Kennedy graduated to the first team. Mee complemented this attacking ability with some more experienced heads; captain Frank McLintock at centre half marshalled a strong defence, while the hard-tackling Peter Storey filled the defensive midfield position. The team showed early signs of promise, reaching two successive League Cup finals, in 1968 and 1969. Both times the Gunners went home empty-handed. The first time Arsenal lost to Don Revie's Leeds United 1‚Äì0 in a dour match of few chances, Terry Cooper grabbing the only goal. The second League Cup loss was an infamous upset ‚Äì Arsenal lost 3‚Äì1 to Third Division side Swindon Town. Eight of the team had been struck by flu that had led to the postponement of Arsenal's previous League fixture, and Arsenal had only reached extra time thanks to a late goalkeeping error that had allowed Bobby Gould to score. In extra time, Don Rogers scored twice as Arsenal searched for a winner. However, that season was not a total disaster for Arsenal; they had also finished fourth, which won them a place in Europe for the 1969‚Äì70 season. In turn, this led to the club collecting their first silverware in seventeen years and also their first European trophy, the 1969‚Äì70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Arsenal beat Ajax 3‚Äì1 on aggregate in the semi-finals, and then staged a famous comeback against Anderlecht in the final. Arsenal were 3-0 down after 74 minutes of the first leg at Stade √âmile Vers√©, but Ray Kennedy got a late away goal to give the Gunners a glimmer of hope; in the second leg in front of a packed Highbury, inspired by captain Frank McLintock, Arsenal won 3‚Äì0 with goals from John Radford, Eddie Kelly and Jon Sammels, to win the tie 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. The same season, Arsenal had only finished 12th in the league, perhaps distracted by their European campaign, and did not look like league contenders. Yet the following season, 1970‚Äì71, Arsenal went on to become only the second club of the 20th century to win the FA Cup and League Double, the club's first. After a bright start Arsenal looked to be out of the title chase with a 5‚Äì0 loss to Stoke City in September. However, Arsenal recovered and put in a strong run (they did not lose again in the league until January), and as the season closed they became involved in a tight race with Leeds United. Arsenal were pushed all the way ‚Äì after being defeated 1‚Äì0 by Leeds in April, they needed to beat or draw 0‚Äì0 with North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on the last day of the season to take the title on goal average. An 87th- minute goal by Ray Kennedy gave Arsenal a 1‚Äì0 lead and despite Spurs' desperate attempts for an equaliser Arsenal hung on to win and take the title. In the meantime, Arsenal had also reached the FA Cup Final, following a titanic semi-final battle with Stoke which saw them come from 2‚Äì0 down to force a replay and eventual victory. In the Final, five days after the win at Tottenham, Arsenal beat Liverpool 2‚Äì1 at Wembley; Arsenal went 1‚Äì0 down early in extra time, before Eddie Kelly's 101st-minute equaliser from close range.George Graham also claimed the goal, though Kelly is officially credited with it. Reference: Ten minutes later, Charlie George scored the winner from the edge of the penalty area to win the game, and the Double, for Arsenal. The Double proved to be a premature high point of a decade characterised by a string of near-misses. Despite signing World Cup winner Alan Ball for a club record ¬£220,000 in the close season, Arsenal began 1971‚Äì72 badly, losing three matches in August, and were forced to play catch-up for the rest of the season, ultimately finishing fifth. Their debut in the European Cup started encouragingly, but they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by a Johann Cruyff-inspired Ajax, who went on to win the trophy as part of a hat-trick of European titles. Arsenal also reached the FA Cup Final for the second year in a row; in a repeat of the 1968 League Cup Final they lost 1‚Äì0 to Leeds United, in an ugly match of few real chances. Arsenal finished as First Division runners-up in 1972‚Äì73, but within a year the Double-winning side had been broken up, and Mee was unable to build a new team in its place. The club's form declined sharply, finishing 16th in 1974‚Äì75 and 17th in 1975‚Äì76, their lowest in more than forty years, which prompted Mee's resignation. Tottenham manager Terry Neill, a former Arsenal player, was appointed in his place, even though he had never got Spurs anywhere beyond mid-table, to become Arsenal's youngest-ever manager.  Four cup finals under Neill (1976‚Äì80)  Worst team Arsenal moved back into the top half of the table, inspired in part by the emergence of Irish superstar Liam Brady. Brady formed part of a large Irish contingent at Highbury, which included Pat Rice, Frank Stapleton, Pat Jennings Sammy Nelson, John Devine and the young David O'Leary. Further to this were experienced signings such as Malcolm Macdonald and Alan Hudson, as well as the return of Don Howe, who had been part of the backroom staff when the Double was won, to the Arsenal coaching setup. Although they could not challenge the League dominance of Liverpool at the time, towards the end of the decade they proved their mettle in the FA Cup. Arsenal reached three finals in a row (1978, 1979, and 1980), but won only one, the 1979 final against Manchester United. Largely inspired by Brady, Arsenal went 2‚Äì0 up through Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton and looked to be coasting to victory; with five minutes to go, United scored twice in quick succession to level the match. Extra time loomed, but Alan Sunderland converted Graham Rix's cross in injury time to secure a famous 3‚Äì2 win. The next season, 1979‚Äì80, proved to be cruel as Arsenal played a record-breaking 70 matches and reached two cup finals, only to end the season empty-handed. Arsenal were favourites to beat Second Division West Ham United in the FA Cup final, but lost 1‚Äì0 to a Trevor Brooking header. Meanwhile, they had also reached the Cup Winners' Cup final against Valencia, after Paul Vaessen's goal had given them a famous victory over Juventus in the semi-finals; the final finished goalless and Arsenal lost on penalties, with Brady and Rix having their efforts saved.  Slight decline (1980‚Äì86)  Liam Brady left Arsenal for Juventus in the summer of 1980, and the team entered another barren spell. They continued to finish in the top four at the start of the 1980s, but never really looked like winning the title, and they could not rediscover their FA Cup form either ‚Äì aside from 1982‚Äì83 when Arsenal reached both cup semi-finals in only to be knocked out in both by Manchester United. Neill struggled to control his team at times; throughout his tenure, he had fallings-out with many of his players (including Hudson and Macdonald) and he was unable to contain the drinking culture within the squad.This is perhaps best exemplified by Arsenal's disastrous 1977 tour of Australia that ended with Neill sending Hudson and Macdonald home halfway through after they were caught breaking curfew. Reference: His signings to replace the departed Brady and Stapleton failed to make the same impact, and towards the end of Neill's reign the club suffered several embarrassing cup defeats; this included losing to part-timers K.F.C. Winterslag in the 1981‚Äì82 UEFA Cup and Third Division Walsall in the 1983‚Äì84 League Cup. Neill was sacked in December 1983, soon after the latter result. Don Howe, Neill's assistant, succeeded him but he could not get the side anywhere near a trophy either. Although Arsenal managed to finish sixth and seventh under him, they never seriously challenged for the title (although they did briefly top the league in October 1984) and were dumped out of the 1984‚Äì85 FA Cup by Third Division York City. The fans were getting increasingly disillusioned with the club's muddling performances and attendances started to dip beneath 20,000. In March 1986, after hearing the board had approached FC Barcelona coach Terry Venables as his replacement, Howe resigned. Steve Burtenshaw was briefly caretaker manager but the club decided to look to outside for Howe's long-term successor. The Arsenal board of directors did contact Scottish club Aberdeen with a view to offering the job to their manager Alex Ferguson (while also drawing up an offer to Millwall manager George Graham to become assistant manager of Arsenal), but Ferguson rejected the offer. However, Ferguson did cross the border six months later to succeed Ron Atkinson at Manchester United.  The George Graham years (1986‚Äì95)  Alan Smith attacking for Arsenal v. Sheffield Wednesday in a match at Highbury in 1992; Arsenal won 7‚Äì1 In May 1986, Millwall manager George Graham, a former Arsenal player, was appointed as Howe's long-term replacement, and it was the beginning of a new era of success at Highbury. Graham gradually sold off most of the older players and replaced them with new signings and players promoted from the youth team, while imposing much stricter discipline than his predecessors, both in the dressing room and on the pitch. Arsenal's form immediately improved, so much so that the club were top of the League at Christmas 1986. Players like Kenny Sansom, Steve Williams, Tommy Caton, Charlie Nicholas and Gus Caesar were gradually discarded and a new-look Arsenal side featured players including Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn, Steve Bould, David Rocastle, Alan Smith, Tony Adams and Paul Merson. Though Arsenal finished fourth in Graham's first season in charge (having led the First Division for most of the winter), Arsenal did win the League Cup, in a campaign marked by comebacks. Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-finals; after losing 1‚Äì0 at Highbury in the first leg and conceding a second goal in the first half of the second leg at White Hart Lane, Arsenal scored twice through Viv Anderson and Niall Quinn to draw 2‚Äì2 on aggregate and force a replay;The away goals rule was not in force in the League Cup at the time; had it been then Arsenal would have won the tie on the night. in the replay Spurs went 1‚Äì0 up, only for Arsenal to come back again with late goals from Ian Allinson and David Rocastle to win. The final against Liverpool was a repeat performance; after Arsenal had gone 1‚Äì0 down to an Ian Rush goal, two Charlie Nicholas goals brought Arsenal their first League Cup triumph and their first major trophy for eight years. However, UEFA voted to continue the ban on English clubs in European competitions that was imposed in the wake of the Heysel disaster in 1985 for a third season, and this meant that Arsenal were unable to compete in the 1987‚Äì88 UEFA Cup. While Arsenal lost the League Cup final the following year in a shock 3‚Äì2 defeat to Luton Town and dipped to sixth place in the league, their League form steadily improved afterwards, thanks largely to a revamped defence which consisted of Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn, Steve Bould and Tony Adams, which formed the basis of Arsenal's successes for a decade or more. Until he left in 1993, long-serving defender David O'Leary remained an important member of the squad who frequently appeared as a substitute and filled in whenever the younger members of the back four were unavailable. However, during this time Graham's Arsenal were not a purely defensive side; Graham also employed capable midfielders such as David Rocastle, Michael Thomas and Paul Merson, and striker Alan Smith, whose prolific goalscoring regularly brought him more than 20 goals in most of the eight seasons he spent at the club. In Graham's third season (1988‚Äì89), the club won the Football League Centenary Trophy before winning their first League title since 1971, in highly dramatic fashion. Having led the League since Christmas, Arsenal were overtaken by Liverpool after losing to Derby County and drawing at home to Wimbledon in May. Arsenal had seemingly thrown away the title, but the final game of the season, on 26 May, was against Liverpool at Anfield; Arsenal needed to win by two goals to take the title; Liverpool had already won the FA Cup and were favourites to complete the Double. Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 1‚Äì0, but as time ticked by Arsenal struggled to get a second, and with 90 minutes gone on the clock, Arsenal still needed another goal and it looked as though the league title would be staying at Anfield. But, with only seconds to go, a Smith flick-on found Michael Thomas surging through the Liverpool defence; the young midfielder lifted the ball over Bruce Grobbelaar and into the net, giving Arsenal the title. Arsenal did not retain the title the following season; they finished fourth in 1989‚Äì90 and fell behind champions Liverpool, runners-up Aston Villa and third-placed Tottenham Hotspur in the title challenge. They also failed to make their mark in the cups, and the post-Heysel ban on English clubs in European competition was still in force at that time, so Arsenal were unable to represent England in the European Cup. The ban was lifted at the end of the season, though Liverpool (the team present at the Heysel disaster) had to serve an extra year. Graham prepared for another title challenge by signing goalkeeper David Seaman and Swedish winger Anders Limpar in the summer of 1990; both players proved vital as Arsenal retook the title in 1990‚Äì91, despite two major setbacks. Arsenal had two points deducted in November 1990 after ten of their players were involved in a brawl with Manchester United players in a match at Old Trafford, and captain Tony Adams was sentenced to four months' imprisonment for drink driving just before Christmas. Despite these setbacks, Arsenal lost only one league match all season and finished seven points clear of Liverpool at the end of what had for most of the season been a two-horse race for the title. They also reached the FA Cup semi-finals, where they faced Tottenham Hotspur; Paul Gascoigne scored with a free kick from 30 yards after just five minutes and Tottenham ran home 3‚Äì1 winners, dashing hopes of a unique second Double. In September 1991, Arsenal paid a club record of ¬£2.5million for Crystal Palace striker Ian Wright, who would go on to spend seven years at the club and become their all-time leading goalscorer in the process. The 1991‚Äì92 season saw the club's first entry in the European Cup for 20 years. The European venture went badly; Arsenal were knocked out by Benfica in the second round and failed to make the lucrative group stage. The season went from bad to worse when the Gunners were knocked out of the FA Cup by lowly Wrexham, though Arsenal recovered to finish fourth in the League. The ban on English clubs in European competitions had been lifted two years earlier, but Arsenal missed out on a UEFA Cup place as English clubs were gradually being phased back into European competitions and at this stage only the second and third placed teams were qualifying for the UEFA Cup. During the 1992 close season the club acquired Danish midfielder John Jensen, who had just won Euro 92 with Denmark, scoring a goal in their victory over Germany in the final. Jensen's arrival coincided with the departure of fellow midfielder David Rocastle to Leeds United, the defending league champions. Around this point, Graham altered his tactics; he became more defensive and turned out far less attack-minded sides, which depended mainly on goals from Wright rather than the whole team. Between 1986‚Äì87 and 1991‚Äì92 Arsenal averaged 66 League goals a season (scoring 81 in 1991‚Äì92), but between 1992‚Äì93 and 1994‚Äì95 they only averaged 48;Statistics sourced from this included just 40 in 1992‚Äì93, when the club finished 10th in the inaugural season of the FA Premier League, scoring fewer than any other team in the division, though they had briefly topped the table in November. They were founder members of the FA Premier League on its launch for the 1992‚Äì93 season. They lost their first ever Premiership game 4-2 after taking a 2‚Äì0 lead over underdogs Norwich City at Highbury; Norwich, among the pre-season relegation favourites, were actively involved in the title race and finished third, whereas Arsenal (among the pre-season title favourites) finished 10th. Arsenal's form in the cups was much better than in the league, and in 1992‚Äì93 they became the first side to win the FA Cup and League Cup double. In the League Cup final, Arsenal faced Sheffield Wednesday; a Merson-inspired Arsenal side came from 1‚Äì0 down to win 2‚Äì1 thanks to a Steve Morrow goal. In the FA Cup, Arsenal beat Spurs 1‚Äì0 in the semi-finals (avenging their defeat of 1991), and played Sheffield Wednesday in the final, just as they had done in the League Cup final a few weeks earlier. The game ended 1‚Äì1 and went to a replay; Wright opened the scoring for Arsenal but Chris Waddle equalised. Extra time came, and still no goal broke the deadlock until the 120th minute, when Andy Linighan powered home a header from a corner to win the match and the cup double for Arsenal. In 1993‚Äì94, Arsenal won their second European trophy; a side missing key players (John Jensen and Martin Keown were injured, while Ian Wright was suspended), beat favourites and holders Parma 1‚Äì0 in the Cup Winners' Cup final in Copenhagen, with a tight defensive performance and Alan Smith's 21st-minute goal from a left foot volley. The 1994 Cup Winners' Cup proved to be George Graham's last trophy at the club; the following February the Scot was sacked after nearly nine years in charge, after it was discovered he had accepted an illegal ¬£425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge following Arsenal's 1992 acquisition of John Jensen, one of Hauge's clients.Graham was eventually banned for a year by the Football Association for his involvement in the scandal, after he admitted he had received an \\"unsolicited gift\\" from Hauge. References: In the weeks before Graham was sacked, he made three major signings for Arsenal. Glenn Helder, a Dutch winger signed from Vitesse, was a regular first-team player for more than a year after joining the club but was then loaned to Benfica before permanently departing in October 1997 to join NAC Breda back in the Netherlands. Chris Kiwomya, an attacking midfielder signed from Ipswich Town, scored 3 goals in 17 matches before the end of the season but never played for the club again, finally departing in 1998 to sign for Queens Park Rangers. Nineteen-year-old Welsh striker John Hartson was signed from Luton Town and occupied the first- team place vacated by the injury-hit Alan Smith, who retired from playing months later. However, Hartson was not a regular player the following season and was sold to West Ham United in 1997. George Graham's final season at Arsenal was also the final season at the club for several of the club's key players. Alan Smith, one of his first signings, was forced into retirement by injury several months later. Paul Davis, the club's longest-serving player, was given a free transfer at the season's end, having found his first team opportunities increasingly limited towards the end of his time at Arsenal. Swedish midfielder Stefan Schwarz was sold to Fiorentina that summer after just one season at Highbury. Striker Kevin Campbell, who had struggled to establish himself as a regular player in spite of some impressive performances over five seasons, was sold to Nottingham Forest. Winger Jimmy Carter, who had failed to establish himself as a regular player in four seasons at Arsenal, was sold to Portsmouth.  Bruce Rioch: The interregnum (1995‚Äì96)  Assistant manager Stewart Houston took charge until the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season. Arsenal finished 12th in the Premier League. However, they did reach the Cup Winners' Cup final again, after a titanic semi-final against Sampdoria, which they won on penalties after drawing 5‚Äì5 on aggregate. Arsenal faced Real Zaragoza in the final; Esn√°ider scored for the Spaniards and John Hartson equalised for Arsenal. The game was heading to a 1‚Äì1 draw and penalties, before midfielder Nayim struck from 40 yards in the 120th minute, in virtually the last kick of the game. David Seaman, who had been Arsenal's hero in the semi-final shootout, could not backpedal fast enough and only got a hand to the ball as it went in. In June 1995, Arsenal appointed Bruce Rioch, who had just guided Bolton Wanderers to the League Cup final and promotion to the top flight, as manager. He (briefly) broke the English transfer record by paying Internazionale ¬£7.5 million for Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp, and the new signing formed an impressive partnership with Ian Wright. Arsenal reached the League Cup semi-finals and finished fifth in the Premiership at the end of 1995‚Äì96, securing a place in the following season's UEFA Cup and giving hope for an eventual title challenge. However, the Rioch era ended abruptly: in August 1996, just before the start of the new season, Rioch was sacked after a dispute over transfer funds with the board of directors, triggering a couple of months' turmoil at the club. Stewart Houston was once again put in temporary charge; he remained at the helm for a month, before resigning to take over at QPR. Youth team coach Pat Rice held the fort for several games, before making way for the Frenchman Ars√®ne Wenger at the end of September. Wenger's arrival and two Doubles (1996‚Äì2003) Premier League win with an open-top bus parade. The team immediately improved under Wenger's management, coming third and winning a UEFA Cup place in 1996‚Äì97, missing out on second (and a Champions League spot) on goal difference. Wenger rebuilt the Arsenal squad with a crop of French players who were largely unknown in the UK. Patrick Vieira had been signed on Wenger's recommendation before he had officially taken up the reins, and Wenger added Nicolas Anelka and Emmanuel Petit, as well as Dutch winger Marc Overmars in the summer of 1997. Wenger melded the new arrivals with some of the \\"old guard\\", retaining Adams, Dixon, Winterburn, Keown and Bould, and he kept Pat Rice on as assistant manager. Wenger got his first silverware, and became the first foreign manager to win the English league, the following season, when he steered the side to their second double. It had looked like Arsenal were out of the title race by December after losing 3‚Äì1 at home to Blackburn, but they overcame a twelve- point deficit to overtake Manchester United; a 4‚Äì0 home win over Everton on 3 May won the title with two matches to spare. On 16 May, Arsenal beat Newcastle United 2‚Äì0 in the FA Cup final to complete the double. To top it off, the same season Ian Wright broke Cliff Bastin's goalscoring record, bringing his tally to 185 goals before leaving the club in the summer of 1998. Dennis Bergkamp was a regular in Wenger's early teams. Despite the signing of Freddie Ljungberg in 1998 and Thierry Henry a year later, a more barren period followed for Arsenal over the next few years, though they came close several times. Arsenal led the League for much of 1998‚Äì99, until a 1‚Äì0 loss to Leeds United allowed Manchester United to overtake them; Arsenal beat Aston Villa on the last day of the season but United's victory over Spurs meant they took the title. To rub it in further, Arsenal also lost the last ever FA Cup semi-final replay to Manchester United; Dennis Bergkamp had missed a penalty in normal time, and Ryan Giggs scored the winner in extra time after a mazy solo run through the Arsenal defence. Arsenal's return to the Champions League for the first time in seven years was also unsuccessful, as they failed to get past the group stage. Arsenal came second again in 1999‚Äì2000; this time, there was never any real title race and Arsenal finished the season 18 points behind winners Manchester United. Arsenal had another poor season in the Champions League, finishing third in their group; this won them a consolation place in the UEFA Cup, and Arsenal got all the way to the final, where they faced Galatasaray in Copenhagen, the scene of their 1994 Cup Winners' Cup triumph. The match was a tepid affair, a 0‚Äì0 draw with few chances; it went to penalties and Arsenal lost after Davor ≈†uker and Patrick Vieira missed their spot-kicks. Arsenal again finished second in 2000‚Äì01, this time ten points behind Manchester United; the title race had been as good as over since February, when Arsenal lost 6‚Äì1 at Old Trafford. Arsenal's season gave priority to the Cups and Europe. They beat Spurs in the semi-finals and met Liverpool in the final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff; Arsenal dominated most of the match, and were denied a goal by the arm of defender St√©phane Henchoz, which went unpunished. Arsenal finally did go 1‚Äì0 up through Ljungberg but succumbed to two late Michael Owen goals and lost 2‚Äì1. In Europe, Arsenal made it to the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 1972, only to be eliminated on the away goals rule by eventual finalists Valencia. By now, Wenger had been forced to rebuild much of the Double-winning side of 1998; Anelka, Overmars and Petit had all left for Spanish clubs in return for hefty fees, while age was finally catching up with the famous back line; Bould and Winterburn had already left, and Adams and Dixon would only last another season before retiring. In their place, Wenger signed the likes of Sol Campbell and Lauren in defence, as well as promoting Ashley Cole from the youth ranks. In midfield, Wenger added the talismanic Robert Pires and signed his compatriot Sylvain Wiltord in attack, while in the meantime Thierry Henry had adapted to the English game to become one of the Premiership's best strikers. Attack was definitely Arsenal's fort√© as they won a record-equalling third Double in 2001‚Äì02 season; the Gunners were the only team to score in every game of the Premiership season, and went unbeaten in domestic away games. After an initially tight title race (just three points separated the top four in February), Arsenal pulled away from the pack with a 13-game winning streak, finishing seven points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. Arsenal secured the title in the penultimate match of the season with a 1‚Äì0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, the goal coming from Wiltord. The previous weekend, Arsenal had wrapped up their eighth FA Cup, beating Chelsea 2‚Äì0 with goals from Ray Parlour and Freddie Ljungberg. In 2002‚Äì03, Arsenal became the first club in more than 20 years to retain the FA Cup, with a 1‚Äì0 victory against Southampton thanks to a Pires goal. Their joy was soured by the fact that they narrowly missed out on retaining the Premiership title. Arsenal had led eventual winners Manchester United by eight points at one stage, but their form collapsed late on in the season; they drew 2‚Äì2 away to Bolton Wanderers after leading 2‚Äì0, and then lost 3‚Äì2 at home to Leeds United a week later, which gave United the title.  The \\"Invincibles\\" and a Champions League Final (2003‚Äì06)  Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira lifts the 2003‚Äì04 Premier League trophy. Little did they know it at the time, but the defeat to Leeds would be Arsenal's last in the League for over a year. 2003‚Äì04 was a record-breaking season for Arsenal, as they won the Premiership unbeaten (26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats), finishing a clear 11 points ahead of second- place Chelsea. They became only the second team to do so, the first having been Preston North End in 1888‚Äì89. Their rivals for the title gained revenge in other competitions ‚Äì Arsenal were defeated in the Champions League quarter- finals and FA Cup semi-finals by Chelsea and Manchester United, respectively, in successive matches. Faced with the potential collapse of their season, Arsenal recovered from being 1‚Äì0 and 2‚Äì1 behind to Liverpool in their next league match to win 4‚Äì2, thanks to a Thierry Henry hat-trick, and went on to win the league with a 2‚Äì2 draw away to Tottenham Hotspur, mimicking their success in 1971. Arsenal were unable to retain the title in 2004‚Äì05, finishing second, 12 points behind a record-breaking Chelsea side. However, the Gunners did stretch their unbeaten run to 49 consecutive matches, an English league football record; the record was equalled with a dramatic 5‚Äì3 win over Middlesbrough (Arsenal having trailed 3‚Äì1 shortly after half-time) and then surpassed with a 3‚Äì0 win over Blackburn Rovers in August 2004, before their unbeaten season was ended with a 2‚Äì0 away defeat by Manchester United. This defeat arguably upset the team's form and they fell away from title contention before recovering with a late flourish to finish second, sealed with a 7‚Äì0 drubbing of Everton. Champions League glory eluded them again, with the club getting knocked out 3‚Äì2 on aggregate by Bayern Munich in the second round. Arsenal did not end the season empty-handed; they came away with their third FA Cup in four years, winning 5‚Äì4 on penalties after a 0‚Äì0 draw where they played ten versus eleven against Manchester United. Weakened by the sale of captain Patrick Vieira to Juventus in the summer of 2005, Arsenal's 2005‚Äì06 season was comparatively disappointing domestically and the club failed to challenge for any trophies at home. In the league, their poor away form dogged them and despite recording some impressive wins at home (5‚Äì0 over Aston Villa, and 7‚Äì0 over Middlesbrough), Arsenal spent much of the latter stages of the season in fifth place or lower, and looked set to miss out on the Champions League for the first time since 1997. However, they won their last three matches of the season, culminating in a 4‚Äì2 victory over Wigan Athletic in the last ever match at Highbury; coupled with Tottenham Hotspur's loss at West Ham the same day, this meant Arsenal pipped Spurs to fourth place and a Champions League spot. In contrast to their domestic form, Arsenal's form in Europe in 2005‚Äì06 was much stronger; they reached the UEFA Champions League final for the first time in their history, becoming the first London club ever to do so. Arsenal finished top of their group unbeaten, above Ajax, Thun and Sparta Prague against whom Thierry Henry scored two goals on away to become the all- time record goalscorer for Arsenal; in the knockout stages they beat Real Madrid (becoming the first British team to beat Madrid at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium), Juventus and then Villarreal to reach the final, setting a competition record of ten matches without conceding a goal in the process. In the final, against Barcelona, Arsenal were reduced to ten men early on when goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off for a professional foul; nevertheless they were the ones who scored first, Sol Campbell scoring with a header from a free kick in the 37th minute. Arsenal desperately defended their lead, but two late goals from Samuel Eto'o and Juliano Belletti meant Barcelona ran out 2‚Äì1 winners.  Move to Emirates Stadium  The Emirates Stadium on the day of Dennis Bergkamp's testimonial, the first match to be played there. Arsenal have been highly successful in the 1990s and 2000s, but Highbury's capacity was limited to only 38,500 in the post-Taylor report era; virtually every match was sold out and the club were unable to maximise matchday revenue. With expansion of Highbury ruled impossible, in 1999, Arsenal announced plans to move to nearby Ashburton Grove; construction started in December 2002 with the demolition of buildings on the site, and in July 2006, the new Emirates Stadium opened, ready for the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season. Arsenal took a little time to get used to their new surroundings and as early as November, manager Ars√®ne Wenger conceded that his side was unlikely to make a serious challenge for the title. Dogged by poor away form throughout the season, Arsenal eventually finished fourth, level on points with third-placed Liverpool. With a team largely filled with reserve and younger players, they reached the League Cup Final, which they lost 2‚Äì1 to Chelsea. They were less successful in other competitions, however, being knocked out early on in both the Champions League and FA Cup. Trophy drought (2006‚Äì13) 2006‚Äì07 marked a transitional period ‚Äì Arsenal had sold a string of key players, including Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Lauren, Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg, and most significantly, all-time top scorer and club captain Thierry Henry to Barcelona. Arsenal went into 2007‚Äì08 season with only four players from the title-winning season in 2003‚Äì04, with the likes of Cesc F√†bregas and Ga√´l Clichy establishing their places in the side. Arsenal started the season strongly, going undefeated until early December, and in the process, setting a club record of 28 matches unbeaten in all competitions. The young squad continued to impress into the new year, with Emmanuel Adebayor in excellent scoring form. But Eduardo, a player of growing importance to the club, suffered a horrific injury at St Andrew's in Birmingham City and the game subsequently ended 2‚Äì2. The team were rocked and, inevitably, Arsenal slumped in the spring, eventually finishing third. They had little success in the cups, knocked out of the Champions League by Liverpool in the quarter-finals and the FA Cup by Manchester United. The League Cup was more fruitful, where Arsenal reached the semi-finals for a third season in a row, before being knocked out 6‚Äì2 on aggregate by Tottenham Hotspur, their first defeat in a North London derby in almost nine years. Arsenal's 2008‚Äì09 season started well, reaching top of the table by late September. After that, the team lost momentum, with three defeats in November, and had dropped out of the top four by Christmas, despite victories over Manchester United and Chelsea. Arsenal continued to drop points in the league in the New Year, but eventually overtook Aston Villa to regain fourth place by mid-March, eventually finishing nine points clear. Arsenal also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing to Chelsea 2‚Äì1 in their first game at the new Wembley Stadium. In Europe, they finished second in their group and beat Roma and Villarreal before losing 4‚Äì1 on aggregate to Manchester United in the semi-finals. Despite being written off by much of the media going into the 2009‚Äì10 season, Arsenal made a bright start in the Premier League, aided by a new attacking formation and added defensive steel, in the form of holding midfielder Alex Song of Cameroon and new signing Thomas Vermaelen of Belgium. Arsenal's title challenge looked set to end in late November, following losses to Chelsea, Manchester United, and Manchester City, but an impressive run of games in December, aided by Chelsea and Manchester United both dropping points, restored momentum to Arsenal's title challenge going into 2010. In December, Arsenal were eliminated from the League Cup at the quarter-final stage by Manchester City. After being written out of the title race once in the 2009‚Äì10 Premier League season by pundits, Arsenal headed into a tough period of matches from 27 January through 10 February, in which they faced Aston Villa, Manchester United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all in a row. After losing to Stoke City in the FA Cup 3‚Äì1, Arsenal drew Aston Villa 0‚Äì0, got thrashed 3‚Äì1 at home by Manchester United, and lost at Chelsea 2‚Äì0. At the time, it left Arsenal nine points behind league leaders Chelsea. Again, Arsenal were written off in their title hopes, only for it to be resurrected once again, after Chelsea lost to Everton 2‚Äì1, Manchester City 4‚Äì2, and drew with Blackburn Rovers 1‚Äì1. Meanwhile, Manchester United also dropped points, drawing with Aston Villa 1‚Äì1 and also losing to Everton 3‚Äì1. Following Arsenal's 2‚Äì0 loss to Chelsea on 7 February, Arsenal went on a good run, winning all of their league games up to 20 March. However, on 27 February, a major injury to Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey occurred;http://www.arsenal.com/match-menu/3151137/first-team/stoke-city-v- arsenal?tab=report , Stoke City 1‚Äì3 Arsenal Match Report, Arsenal.com 27 February 2010, accessed 25 March 2010 it was eerily reminiscent of Eduardo's injury against Birmingham City on 23 February. However, whereas Arsenal drew against Birmingham that year 2‚Äì2 following a penalty call against Ga√´l Clichy in injury time (in which James McFadden converted the penalty and left then- captain William Gallas kicking at an advertisement board and in tears) and questioned Arsenal's fragile team mentality, Arsenal managed to rally against Stoke 3‚Äì1, having scored a penalty from captain Cesc F√†bregas in the 90th minute, and defender Thomas Vermaelen scoring a third in injury time. As of 25 March, Arsenal are in third place with 67 points, two points behind league leaders Manchester United with 31 games played. Arsenal's Champions League match against Porto in the first leg went poorly. Played at the Est√°dio do Drag√£o in Porto on 17 February 2010, the first goal was scored by Porto: in the 11th minute of the match, stand-in goalkeeper ≈Åukasz Fabia≈Ñski (for the injured Manuel Almunia) pushed a cross from Silvestre Varela into his own net, resulting in a quick 1‚Äì0 lead for Porto. However, in the 18th minute, Sol Campbell, making his first Champions League appearance for Arsenal since the 2006 Champions League final, scored a header from Vermaelen's headed flick and Tom√°≈° Rosick√Ω's headed setup from a corner delivered by F√†bregas. This gave Arsenal a possibly vital away goal. However, the match got worse for Arsenal as miscommunication by Campbell and Fabia≈Ñski led to the goalkeeper picking up what was judged a deliberate back pass to the goal keeper inside the 18-yard box. As a result, the referee gave a free-kick to Porto inside Arsenal's penalty area. R√∫ben Micael took the resulting quick free-kick directly, catching the Arsenal defence and goalkeeper off-guard and squared a pass to Radamel Falcao, who easily scored. The game match 2‚Äì1 for Porto. Arsenal's second leg against Porto fared much better. Played at the Emirates Stadium on 9 March, Arsenal needed at least one goal and a clean sheet to advance, with the aggregate score 2‚Äì1 for Porto and away aggregate 1‚Äì0 for Arsenal. The match began brightly for Arsenal, as Nicklas Bendtner scored in the 10th and 25th minute, before Samir Nasri scored a fantastic goal in the 66th minute, dribbling past three defenders on the far right side touchline before scoring from an acute angle, hitting the goalkeeper's right post and into the net. Three minutes later, Emmanuel Ebou√© scored on a counter-attack, dribbling past goalkeeper Helton before tucking the ball into an empty net. The night ended with Bendtner scoring a penalty in the 90th minute, thus giving him his first senior professional hat-trick, and Arsenal advancing to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, 6‚Äì2 on aggregate. Bendtner had missed a number of easy chances the match before Porto against Burnley. However, Arsenal managed to win 3‚Äì1 in that match. On 19 March 2010, Arsenal drew Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals. The first of the two-legged match was played on 31 March at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium; it marked Thierry Henry's return to the Emirates for the first time as an opponent of Arsenal. The second leg was played on 6 April at the Camp Nou and marked Cesc F√†bregas' return to the Catalan giants, where he played in their youth squad. In their first leg match at Emirates, Arsenal drew 2‚Äì2 with Bar√ßa, with goals from Theo Walcott and captain F√†bregas. The second leg at the Camp Nou did not go as well, despite Bendtner scoring early on. Lionel Messi scored four goals to end the match at an aggregate score of 6‚Äì3 for Barcelona, eliminating Arsenal from the Champions League. Arsenal finished the Premier League season in third place, their 15th successive top-five finish and the 13th successive season they had achieved qualification for the Champions League. It was also their fifth successive trophyless season, however, something of a disappointment considering this trophyless spell was preceded by five trophy winning seasons from a possible eight (including two seasons where they won the double). 2010‚Äì11 saw Arsenal perform well in the Premier League and compete strongly in a title challenge, alongside Manchester United. To prove such a challenge, they faced struggling champions Chelsea on 27 December and mauled them 3‚Äì1 at Emirates. Good form continued in the following months and in February, manager Ars√®ne Wenger was awarded Manager of the Month Award. Notable events in this month was the 2‚Äì1 win over Barcelona, in which the team came from behind to seal a win, and the 4‚Äì4 draw against Newcastle United that is widely regarded to be one of the most bizarre and great games of the Premier League era. They progressed to the final of the League Cup but were beaten 2‚Äì1 by Birmingham City, squandering their chances of winning a trophy. After this embarrassment, the Gunners travelled to the Camp Nou to play the second leg of the Bar√ßa tie, where they were beaten by the three-time winners and eventual victors. Arsenal's FA Cup run ended with defeat in the quarter-finals to Manchester United. Also, completing a miserable couple of weeks for the Gunners, their title hopes were ended when they lost 2‚Äì1 to Bolton Wanderers away in April 2011. After challenging for the title for the majority of the season, Arsenal ended up finishing fourth after losses at Stoke and Aston Villa. Arsenal had failed to win a single trophy for the seventh consecutive year. The 2011‚Äì12 campaign commenced for Arsenal on 13 August 2011 against Newcastle in the midst of two major transfer sagas concerning the club's biggest assets: Cesc F√†bregas and Samir Nasri both departed Arsenal. The game finished 0‚Äì0 and neither of the said players were in the named squad, but new signing Gervinho was sent off for violent conduct. However, the team did muster a 1‚Äì0 win over Italian outit Udinese in the first leg of a Champions League playoff. On 15 August 2011, F√†bregas left for Barcelona for an estimated ‚Ç¨35 million. In addition to his loss, Nasri left for Manchester City on 24 August 2011, ending a protracted transfer saga after playing for Arsenal in their match against Liverpool on 21 August, in which Arsenal lost 2‚Äì0, placing them 14th with one draw and one loss. However, they managed to gain qualification for the Champions League for the upcoming year for the 14th time; the only other English Club to boast such a record in recent years is Manchester United. With mounting injury problems and suspensions, the season was already looking bleak for Arsenal, and this was epitomized by an 8‚Äì2 mauling in the hands of Manchester United. Following their collapse early in the season, Arsenal were already written off as title challengers, with some fans suggesting Arsenal's long-standing manager Ars√®ne Wenger be sacked. After the disappointing result against Manchester United, Arsenal went on a spending spree on the last day of the transfer window, purchasing Per Mertesacker, Mikel Arteta, Andr√© Santos and Yossi Benayoun. Results began to improve, with a win over newly promoted Swansea City, before a Champions League away draw against Borussia Dortmund. Winning in the League Cup against Shrewsbury Town, in the Premier League against Bolton and in the Champions League against Olympiacos boosted morale around the club, and Arsenal began climbing the league table, after spending a time in the bottom quarter of the table. Despite losing the first North London Derby of the season against Tottenham, Arsenal continued to gain points, and as of 23 October 2011 were in seventh place in the Premier League. In week that followed, Arsenal managed to extend their good form by beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge 3‚Äì5, with a hat-trick from captain Robin van Persie. December 2011 saw the announcement of the possible comeback of Thierry Henry, Arsenal's all-time best player and goalscorer, to whom a statue was built, to the club, and the following month, it was confirmed that he had rejoined the Gunners from the New York Red Bulls on a two-month loan deal coinciding with the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season. On 9 January 2012, Henry marked his return to Arsenal with his second debut at the Emirates against Leeds United in the third round of the FA Cup. Furthermore, he scored the winning goal ‚Äì his 227th overall for Arsenal ‚Äì after coming on as a substitute and collecting a long through ball from Alex Song. It was a moment that sent Arsenal fans into raptures, and Henry gave them even more to cheer about when he produced another winner to give Arsenal a 2‚Äì1 victory in a Premier League match against Sunderland. However, the Gunners suffered a shocking 4‚Äì0 loss to Milan in the Champions League in what would eventually be Henry's final match with the club, creating what proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for the club to overturn. Arsenal were also eliminated from the FA Cup in the fifth round, again against Sunderland, losing 2‚Äì0. In spite of these failures, Arsenal tried to turn the 2011‚Äì12 season into a positive one, almost eliminating Milan by winning 3‚Äì0 at the Emirates Stadium and winning 5‚Äì2 in the second North London Derby of the season against Spurs. Arsenal remained third in the Premier League table; while not mathematically assured of a place in the 2012‚Äì13 UEFA Champions League due to Chelsea's continued participation in the Champion's League, with three weeks to go before the end of the 2011‚Äì12 Premier League season. Manchester City eventually won the league again after three decades, their first Premiership title. The beginning of 2012‚Äì13 season saw rumours about the possible departure of star player Robin van Persie, since on 4 July 2012 he announced he would not renew his contract with the club. To this situation, Ars√®ne Wenger signed strikers Olivier Giroud from Montpellier and Lukas Podolski from 1. FC K√∂ln. When Van Persie's transfer to rivals Manchester United was effective, Wenger also purchased Spanish winger Santi Cazorla from M√°laga. Arsenal were eliminated in the round of 16 of the 2013 UEFA Champions League 3‚Äì3 on away goals against eventual champions Bayern Munich. Despite being knocked out of the Champions League, Arsenal had a very strong finish to their domestic campaign. After losing the North London Derby 2‚Äì1 to Tottenham on 3 March, Arsenal collected 26 points over their remaining ten games, including a 1‚Äì1 draw with Manchester United on 28 April, and relegating the newly crowned FA Cup winners Wigan Athletic with a 4‚Äì1 victory on 14 May. Arsenal secured fourth place in the Premier League and a Champions League qualifying spot with a 1‚Äì0 win over Newcastle. However, with the win came some controversy at half-time in the Tottenham‚ÄìSunderland game. It was wrongly reported that Newcastle had tied the game. Much to the dismay of Tottenham supporters, despite their win against Sunderland, Arsenal still finished above them. Three FA Cups in four years (2013‚Äì17) The 2013 off- season was quite tumultuous for Arsenal supporters. Before the start of the transfer window, many of the club's youth players were sold or left the club. Previous Arsenal record transfer fee holder Andrey Arshavin went back to Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg, and Den√≠lson to S√£o Paulo and S√©bastien Squillaci were some of the bigger name players to leave on free transfers. Despite the club's promised ambitions to make big signings, Arsenal had only captured the signature of 20-year-old Frenchman Yaya Sanogo from Auxerre. Halfway through the summer transfer season, the club had a protracted saga with possible signing of Liverpool striker Luis Su√°rez. The club believed that a bid above ¬£40 million would trigger a release clause, but this information proved incorrect and Su√°rez remained under contract with Liverpool. In the chase for Su√°rez, the club was also thought to be close to signing Gonzalo Higua√≠n from Real Madrid, but the striker instead signed for Napoli. With the 2013‚Äì14 Premier League season on the horizon, Arsenal sold Ivorian striker Gervinho to Roma for an estimated ¬£8.5 million and goalkeeper Vito Mannone to Sunderland for an estimated ¬£2.5 million. On transfer deadline day, German international midfielder Mesut √ñzil was transferred to Arsenal from Real Madrid for a club-record fee. In a twist of fate, Real elected to sell √ñzil to create the opportunity they needed to sign star forward Gareth Bale from Tottenham, the Gunners' long-time rivals. During the January transfer, Arsenal also acquired the services of Kim K√§llstr√∂m from Spartak Moscow until the end of the season. At the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season, the team finished the Premier League in fourth place. Having beaten defending champions Wigan Athletic in the semi-finals, Arsenal made it to the 2014 FA Cup Final and took on Hull City on 17 May 2014. Coming back from 2‚Äì0 down after just eight minutes, the Gunners levelled the score at 2‚Äì2 by the end of 90 minutes, with goals from Santi Cazorla and Laurent Koscielny in either half. In the second period of extra time, Aaron Ramsey scored the deciding goal in the 109th minute to seal the win and Arsenal's first major trophy in nine years. During the transfer window that coincided with the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Wenger brought in David Ospina (Colombia) and Mathieu Debuchy (France) after seeing their performances while a pundit for French TV during the tournament, and also added young English defender Calum Chambers from Southampton. His most important signing, however, proved to be Alexis S√°nchez, who also impressed during the tournament with Chile and who Barcelona was letting let leave in order to save money for the transfer of Luis Su√°rez from Liverpool. In the Community Shield match against the 2014 Premier League champions Manchester City, Arsenal convincingly won 3‚Äì0 for their second trophy within three months. Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and substitute Olivier Giroud scored the goals in the traditional opening game of the English football season. In the 2014‚Äì15 Premier League, after a hard-fought 2‚Äì1 comeback win where Aaron Ramsey scored in the final minute of the first game against Crystal Palace, two away draws at Everton and Leicester City in August, plus right back Bacary Sagna's earlier move to Manchester City, fans wanted another signing. Arsenal managed to sign Danny Welbeck from Manchester United on deadline day while Wenger officiated at a Peace Game hosted by Pope Francis. Arsenal remained undefeated for the first six games until they lost 2‚Äì0 at Chelsea on 5 October. They went on to finish third in the league and won the FA Cup for the second year in a row after a 4‚Äì0 trouncing of Aston Villa in the final at Wembley, thanks to goals by Theo Walcott, Alexis S√°nchez from distance, Per Mertesacker and Olivier Giroud, respectively. This qualified them for their second successive Community Shield, this time against Chelsea, and the Gunners retained the Shield thanks to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's first-half strike. This match was the debut of new goalkeeper Petr ƒåech, who had coincidentally arrived from Chelsea after having won the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League with the Blues, and the Czech managed to keep a clean sheet against his former club. It was also the first time that Wenger had beaten a team managed by Jos√© Mourinho, his 14th attempt, while finishing third in the league. For the following season, Arsenal gradually progressed upon their league form, eventually becoming runners-up in 2016. In order to capture that ever-elusive Premier League title for the first time in 12 years, the club spent heavily in the transfer market in the summer of 2016, spending over ¬£80 million on four first-team acquisitions, namely capturing Shkodran Mustafi and Granit Xhaka, who operate as a central defender and central midfielder, respectively. Both positions were long deemed problem positions in the team, with the hope Arsenal could push on and win the league after signing the pair. However, poor league form saw Arsenal competing heavily for the final UEFA Champions League space, having taken a race with Liverpool and Manchester City to the final day of the season. Despite winning 3‚Äì1 against Everton, results elsewhere meant they only finished fifth, missing out on a Champions League spot for the first time in two decades, and the first ever under Wenger. However, Arsenal won the FA Cup Final 2‚Äì1 against Chelsea, making it their third win in four seasons, and made them the most successful club in the history of the competition. Return to Europa League and Wenger's departure (2017‚Äì18) In order to rebuild the squad after a disappointing league campaign, and to prepare for the club's first in the UEFA Europa League, Arsenal used the following off- season to sign strongman left-back Sead Kola≈°inac from Schalke 04, while also purchasing striker Alexandre Lacazette for a club-record ¬£46.5 million. The two players made their debuts in the 2017 FA Community Shield against league champions Chelsea, where Kola≈°inac scored to send the game to a penalty shootout. Arsenal scored all four of their penalties to claim their 15th Shield and their sixth trophy in five seasons. The club parted ways with seventeen players, including first-team stalwart Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Liverpool for a record sale fee of ¬£40 million. The club, however, began the 2017-18 campaign poorly, failing to register an away win until December. After outcry from fans about the club's inabilities on the pitch, Arsenal went and appointed backroom trio Sven Mislintat, Ra√∫l Sanllehi, and Huss Farhmy, to act as head scout, head of footballing relations, and contract negotiator respectively, in order to address the club's shortcomings. Ars√®ne Wenger in his final home match as manager of Arsenal in 2018. Following the trio's appointments, Arsenal produced a more aggressive stance in the following transfer market, allowing disgruntled star Alexis S√°nchez depart to Manchester United in a swap-deal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was a player Arsenal had chased in the past. The club also allowed squad-fillers Francis Coquelin, Mathieu Debuchy, and Theo Walcott to leave, while brokering a deal to allow for the departure of Olivier Giroud, a noble servant to the club, for Chelsea. This was done after Arsenal were able to acquire the signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, one of the most coveted forwards in Europe, for a new club-record fee of ¬£56 million. These additions were enough to bring Arsenal to the final of the 2017‚Äì18 EFL Cup, although, losing to rampant Manchester City 3‚Äì0. Arsenal would then go on their worst losing streak since 2002, losing four consecutive games in all competitions. The club also lost five out of seven league games by March 2018, scoring 12, and conceding 15. When factoring in all competitions, the club conceded an additional two, while registering only one more. This meant Arsenal conceded, on average, over twice a game ‚Äì Arsenal were beginning to lose status as a big name in the football world. On 20 April, following a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Newcastle United, Ars√®ne Wenger decided that he would step down as Arsenal manager at the end of the season as there was much need for a change at the football club. Arsenal's final few matches under Wenger included big home wins against West Ham and Burnley but poor away form continued with defeats at Manchester United and Leicester City, as well as a Europa League exit at the semi-finals to Atl√©tico Madrid. Arsenal's final match under Wenger, however, diminished this dreadful form on the road, winning 0‚Äì1 at Huddersfield as Wenger bowed out as the Arsenal boss. After Ars√®ne Wenger (2018‚Äìpresent) Unai Emery, who has managed Arsenal since 2018. After conducting an overhaul in the club's operating model to coincide with Wenger's departure, Spaniard Unai Emery was named as the club's new head coach on 23 May 2018. He agreed to a two-year deal with the club. He would become the club's first ever 'head coach', while also their second ever manager from outside the United Kingdom. His first match was an 8‚Äì0 win in a friendly against Boreham Wood in Arsenal's pre-season, during which the Gunners lost only once in five matches. Emery's signings for the 2018‚Äì19 season included German goalkeeper Bernd Leno, Greek centre-back Sokratis, Uruguayan midfielder Lucas Torreira and French teenager Matt√©o Guendouzi. On 7 August 2018, Alisher Usmanov announced that he would accept an offer from American businessman Stan Kroenke to buy his 30% stake in Arsenal for ¬£550 million, in a deal that would allow Kroenke to take full control of the club. In Unai Emery's first competitive game in charge, on 13 August, Arsenal lost to Manchester City 0‚Äì2 in the Premier League. After a second consecutive loss to Chelsea on 18 August, Emery recorded his first win as Arsenal manager on 25 August, in a 3‚Äì1 home win over West Ham United, followed by a hard-fought 2‚Äì3 away win at Cardiff City. Following those two victories Arsenal went on to enjoy a 22-match unbeaten run in all competitions, the Gunners' best run since November 2007. This run saw them top their Europa League group and record stellar Premier League wins, including a stylish 1‚Äì5 away win at Fulham and a memorable 4‚Äì2 North London derby home win against Tottenham. However Arsenal's unbeaten run ended on 16 December with a 3‚Äì2 league defeat at struggling Southampton. This was followed by a League Cup fifth round exit to Tottenham and a run of only two league wins in five matches that included a 5‚Äì1 hammering defeat at Liverpool on 29 December, meaning that Arsenal's form slipped following a promising start. Arsenal then won 2‚Äì0 at home against Chelsea in the Premier League on 19 January but were then knocked out of the FA Cup at the fourth round by Manchester United. During the closing stages of the season Arsenal suffered three consecutive league defeats: a home loss to Crystal Palace and two dismal away defeats by Wolves and Leicester City. Arsenal then drew 1‚Äì1 against out-of-form Brighton in the Gunners' final home match of the season, before winning 1‚Äì3 at Burnley. Despite this win, however, Arsenal could only finish fifth in the league, although it was an improvement from last season where they finished sixth. Arsenal's final match of the season saw them play in the Europa League final against Chelsea in Azerbaijan, but they suffered a humiliating 4‚Äì1 defeat.

They were first identified in screens for mutations causing early onset forms of familial Alzheimer's disease by Peter St George-Hyslop at the Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases at the University of Toronto, and now also at the University of Cambridge. Vertebrates have two presenilin genes, called PSEN1 (located on chromosome 14 in humans) that encodes presenilin 1 (PS-1) and PSEN2 (on chromosome 1 in humans) that codes for presenilin 2 (PS-2). Both genes show conservation between species, with little difference between rat and human presenilins. The nematode worm C. elegans has two genes that resemble the presenilins and appear to be functionally similar, sel-12 and hop-1. Presenilins undergo cleavage in an alpha helical region of one of the cytoplasmic loops to produce a large N-terminal and a smaller C-terminal fragment that together form part of the functional protein. Cleavage of presenilin 1 can be prevented by a mutation that causes the loss of exon 9, and results in loss of function. Presenilins play a key role in the modulation of intracellular Ca2+ involved in presynaptic neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation induction.  Structure  The structure of presenilin-1 is still controversial, although recent research has produced a more widely accepted model. When first discovered, the PSEN1 gene was subjected to hydrophobicity analysis that predicted that the protein would contain ten trans-membrane domains. All previous models agreed that the first six putative membrane-spanning regions cross the membrane. These regions correspond to the N-terminal fragment of PS-1 but the structure of the C-terminal fragment was disputed. A recent paper by Spasic et al. provides strong evidence of a nine transmembrane structure with cleavage and assembly into the gamma-secretase complex prior to insertion into the plasma membrane. However, because this is a protein with large numbers of hydrophobic regions, it is unlikely that x-ray crystallography will provide definitive proof of the structure. The structure of the presenilin-1 C-terminal catalytic fragment was determined using solution NMR. It is made up of alpha helices and is 176 amino acids in length.  Function  Most cases of Alzheimer's disease are not hereditary. However, there is a small subset of cases that have an earlier age of onset and have a strong genetic element. In patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (autosomal dominant hereditary), mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be found. The majority of these cases carry mutant presenilin genes. An important part of the disease process in Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of Amyloid beta (AŒ≤) protein. To form AŒ≤, APP must be cut by two enzymes, beta secretases and gamma secretase. Presenilin is the sub-component of gamma secretase that is responsible for the cutting of APP. Gamma secretase can cut APP at several points within a small region of the protein, which results in AŒ≤ of various lengths. The lengths associated with Alzheimer's disease are 40 and 42 amino acids long. AŒ≤ 42 is more likely to aggregate to form plaques in the brain than AŒ≤ 40. Presenilin mutations lead to an increase in the ratio of AŒ≤ 42 produced compared to AŒ≤ 40, although the total quantity of AŒ≤ produced remains constant. This can come about by various effects of the mutations upon gamma secretase. Presenilins are also implicated in the processing of notch, an important developmental protein. Mice that have the PS1 gene knocked out die early in development from developmental abnormalities similar to those found when notch is disrupted. The genes for the presenilins were found through linkage studies using mutations present in familial Alzheimer's cases in 1995. The genetic inactivation of presenilins in hippocampal synapses has shown this selectively affects the long-term potentiation caused by theta with the inactivation in presynapse but not the postsynapse impairing short-term plasticity and synaptic facilitation. The release of glutamate was also reduced in presynaptic terminals by processes that involve modulation of intracellular Ca2+ release. This has been suggested to \\"represent a general convergent mechanism leading to neurodegeneration\\".

The park was closed to downhill skiing in late 2014, when the concession contract expired. The state has completed a study on what improvements to the park facilities would be needed to fully re- open the park. The skiing ranged from easy, beginner slopes to some of the most dangerous, expert, black diamond slopes on the east coast of the United States. There are four ski lifts at the park, each of which stops at a different elevation on the slopes. Lift-accessed Snow tubing is also available at Denton Hill State Park, or Ski Denton. There are five chalets on the grounds of Ski Denton. Each cabin has wall to wall carpeting and two bedrooms that sleep up to six individuals. There is a large living room with a cathedral ceiling in each cabin. The cabins also have a full kitchen, dining room, and bathroom. A hostel style bunkhouse sits atop the main lodge. Ski Denton opens its slopes and trails for mountain bikers in the off season; when the lifts were running, bikers could use those to get to the top of the slopes. There are over of maintained downhill and cross-country single track and trails available for riding. A mountain bike trail begins at Denton Hill State Park and is long, passing through Patterson State Park on its way to Cherry Springs State Park. Part of the Susquehannock Trail System, an loop hiking trail, forms the southern border of the park.

She rose fast as a spy, achieving the position of National Security Coordinator, at the Cabinet Office. She worked with Harry Pearce on a number of operations during the 1970s. Pearce describes her as ruthless, right-wing, and crazy, who'll stop at nothing to protect Britain. She is driven and single-minded, with a take-no-prisoners attitude, which some find highly attractive. She cares little for the impact of her words, and will often talk bluntly rather than in a roundabout way. She was left apparently paralysed from the waist down by a car bomb attack on the Home Secretary, Nicholas Blake in Series 5, Episode 1, during a chain of terrorist attacks, and reappeared later in the series in a wheelchair. Shaw may harbour a grudge against Ros Myers, since it was her father, Sir Jocelyn Myers, who organised the chain of attacks that ultimately led to the car bomb and her paralysis. However, she reappears in series 6 as a high-ranking Yalta operative - stating that she had been working with the organisation under deep cover - freely walking around and apparently unparalysed. In the same episode that she is revealed as a member of Yalta, she is the person who 'kills' Ros Myers by injecting her with what she thought was a lethal nerve agent. Believing Myers to be dead, Shaw escaped to fight another day; however, unbeknownst to her, Adam Carter had switched the syringes and so Myers was merely put into a deathlike state until her funeral, where Carter helped her escape into anonymity. Shaw never makes an appearance again.

They were popularly known as the \\"herbaceous borders\\", in humorous reference to a well-known adage about the Royal Navy (\\"Britain's best bulwarks are her wooden walls\\"), as well as to a type of garden border popular in the United Kingdom. Fleet minesweepers The Flowers were designed to be built at merchant shipyards, to ease the pressure on yards specializing in warships. The initial three groups were the first purpose-built fleet minesweepers, built with triple hulls at the bow to give extra protection against loss from mine damage when working. When submarine attacks on British merchant ships became a serious menace after 1916, the existing Flower-class minesweepers were transferred to convoy escort duty, and fitted with depth charges, as well as 4.7-inch naval guns. * : first group to be built, in 1915. 24 vessels built in two batches of 12.

Of these, 17 British and one French Flowers were sunk. Some members of the class served as patrol vessels throughout the world during the peacetime years between the wars, but almost all were disposed of by World War II. This allowed the majority of the class names to be revived for the new, smaller s.

It operates sixteen locations, including the main Central Library location. Although similarly named, the St. Louis Public Library is unrelated to the St. Louis County Library system. History In 1865, Ira Divoll, the superintendent of the St. Louis Public School system, created a subscription library in the public school library that would later evolve into the St. Louis Public Library. Divoll believed that a library should work in tandem with the public education system and offer citizens an opportunity for self- improvement and culture. In 1869, Divoll‚Äôs subscription library moved to the Board of Education building. The library consisted of 4 staff members who offered reference services 12 hours a day. The library also encouraged children to visit, and had no age restrictions as did most libraries of the day. Due to rapid growth of the collection, which grew from 1,500 volumes in 1865 to 90,000 volumes by 1893, the library required more space. In 1893, the library moved into a new space on the top floors of the new Board of Education building. Also in 1893, the citizens of St. Louis voted to move the administration of the library to an independent board, supported by a property tax. This vote enabled the library to operate without subscription fees and be open to all St. Louis residents. The library occupied its space in the Board of Education building until 1909, as the Central Library was being constructed. The Board of Education building wasn‚Äôt large enough to accommodate the library's growing collection. It was during this time that the library began its role as a lending library, allowing the public to ‚Äòcheck out‚Äô and take books home. In 1901, Andrew Carnegie made a large donation which was used for expansion, including the building which is currently the Central Library. By this time the collection included 90,000 books. By 1938 the collection included 900,000 items, and by 2014, 4.6 million items Locations The St. Louis Public Library operates 17 libraries, including the main Central Library. Branches include Baden, Barr, Buder, Cabanne, Carondelet, Carpenter, Central Express, Charing Cross, Compton, Julia Davis, Divoll, Kingshighway, Machacek, Marketplace, Schlafly, and Walnut Park. In addition to the Central Library building, Barr, Cabanne, Carpenter and Carondelet branch buildings were Carnegie libraries. =Central Library= Inside the humanities and social sciences room of the Central Library in 2010 The Central Library building at 13th and Olive was built in 1912 on a location formerly occupied by the St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall and was designed by Cass Gilbert. The main library for the city's public library system has an oval central pavilion surrounded by four light courts. The outer facades of the free-standing building are of lightly rusticated Maine granite. The Olive Street front is disposed like a colossal arcade, with contrasting marble bas- relief panels. A projecting three-bay central block, like a pared-down triumphal arch, provides a monumental entrance. At the rear, the Central Library faces a sunken garden. The interiors feature some light-transmitting glass floors. The ceiling of the Periodicals Room is modified from Michelangelo's ceiling in the Laurentian Library. Renovation and expansion of the building began in 2010 and finished in 2012.http://www.slpl.org/slpl/library/article233432419.asp Services * Children's Sections * Launch Pads (tablets for checkout that feature apps for children with an educational theme) * Reference Services * Programs, Special Events, and Author Visits/Book Signings * Periodicals & Nationwide/Worldwide Newspapers * Audio-Visual Material including DVDs, Blu-Ray, VHS Tapes, Books on CD, Playaways, Music CDs * Video Games (PS4, Wii, Wii U, Xbox One, Xbox 360) * Digital Services (Hoopla, Freegal Music, Zinio) * Neighborhood Specific Material * Interlibrary loan (ILL) * Computers with High Speed Internet, Printing, Word Processing capabilities * Voter Registration * Computer Visitor Passes *Creative Experience digital makerspace See also *List of Carnegie libraries in Missouri *Frederick M.

They are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the government of China. Name Despite the name by which they are known in China, the Tajiks of Xinjiang are not the same as the Tajik people (who speak the Tajik language). The Tajiks in Xinjiang of China, are an extension of the Pamiri people, a different Iranian group who speak the indigenous Eastern Iranian Pamiri languages. History =Early period= Tashkurgan Town became the capital of the Sarikol kingdom (Ëâ≤ÂãíÂ∫ìÂ∞î), a kingdom of the Pamir Mountains. =Medieval period= Xinjiang and its eastern Iranian- speaking peoples underwent gradual Turkification caused by the conquests and settlements of Turkic peoples like the Uyghurs and Qarakhanids. By the Mongol period, most of these eastern Iranian peoples were assimilated into the Turkic community. The Tajiks of Xinjiang claim to be descended from the remaining Eastern Iranians who still resided in the mountainous region of Xinjiang. This claim is seemingly supported by medieval Chinese literature, documents and modern archaeological evidence. =Conversion to Nizari Ismailism= According to oral tradition, Nasir Khusraw led a mission to the region with four of his disciples: Sayyid Hassan Zarrabi, Sayyid Surab Wali, Sayyid Jalal Bukhari and Jahan Malikshah. Khusraw purportedly told some of his disciples to settle down in the area to continue to aid and preach to the local converts about Ismailism. Many current pirs (holy men) claim descent from these early disciples. =Qing dynasty= During the Qing dynasty, the Tajiks were administered by a system of Begs like the rest of Xinjiang. During the Qing dynasty the Chinese claimed suzerainty over the Taghdumbash Pamir in the south west of Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County but permitted the Mir of Hunza to administer the region in return for a tribute. The Tajiks of Xinjiang practiced slavery, selling some of their own as a punishment. Submissive slaves were given wives and settled with the Tajiks. They were considered property and could be sold anytime. Their slaves came from numerous sources, enslaving Sunni captives such as Kirghiz in retaliation for Kirghiz slave raids against the Tajiks since the Kirghiz sold them into slavery in these raids or from Hunza (also known as Khujund), Gilgit and Chitral. Slaves from Chitral and Kunjud passed through there to Bukhara. The Sunnis called them Rafidites and did not consider them Muslim (as enslaving fellow Muslims is contrary to Sharia law). Most foreign slaves in Xinjiang were Shia Mountain Tajiks, they were referred to by Sunni Turkic Muslims as Ghalcha. Shia Mountain Tajik Ghalchas made up the majority of slave trafficked and sold in Xinjiang to the Sunni Muslim Turkic inhabitants and they were seen as foreigners and strangers. Serfs were treated in a \\"wretched\\" manner. An anti- Russian uproar broke out when Russian customs officials, 3 Cossacks and a Russian courier invited local Turki Muslim (Uyghur) prostitutes to a party in January 1902 in Kashgar, this caused a massive brawl by the inflamed local Turki Muslim populace against the Russians on the pretense of protecting Muslim women because there was anti-Russian sentiment being built up, even though morality was not strict in Kashgar, the local Turki Muslims violently clashed with the Russians before they were dispersed, the Chinese sought an end to tensions to prevent the Russians from building up a pretext to invade. After the riot, the Russians sent troops to Sarikol in Tashkurghan and demanded that the Sarikol postal services be placed under Russian supervision, the locals of Sarikol believed that the Russians would seize the entire district from the Chinese and send more soldiers even after the Russians tried to negotiate with the Begs of Sarikol and sway them to their side, they failed since the Sarikoli officials and authorities demanded in a petition to the Amban of Yarkand that they be evacuated to Yarkand to avoid being harassed by the Russians and objected to the Russian presence in Sarikol, the Sarikolis did not believe the Russian claim that they would leave them alone and only involved themselves in the mail service. =Republic of China= In the 1940s around 9,000 Tajiks lived in Xinjiang. During the Ili Rebellion, Uyghur forces butchered the livestock of the Tajiks as they advanced south. The Soviet backed insurgents destroyed Tajik crops and acted aggressively against the Tajiks and Kirghiz of China. Distribution The population of Tajiks in China numbered 41,028 in 2000 and 50,265 (Xinjiang only) in 2015. They are located in China's Western Xinjiang region with 60% living in Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County. Despite the name \\"Tajik\\" that is used to refer to them, the Tajiks of China do not speak the Tajik language. Early 20th-century travelers to the region referred to them as Sarikoli,A Journey of Geographical and Archarological Exploration in Chinese Turkestan A Stein ‚Äì 1904 ‚Äì [sn] ... 15,800 feet above the sea, into Chinese territory on the Taghdumbash Pamir, using the yaks of the Sarikoli herdsmen...The Heart of a Continent ‚Äì Younghusband ‚Äì ...an encampment belonging to a Sarikoli, who very kindly asked me to have some refreshment... (pg 242) \\"Mountain Tajiks,\\"Through the Unknown Pamirs; the Second Danish Pamir Expedition 1898‚Äì99 By Ole Olufsen or Ghalcha. As of 2015‚Äì16, more than four thousand Mountain Tajiks lived in nearby Poskam County (Zepu). Some Mountain Tajiks live in Kokyar (Kekeya), Kargilik County (Yecheng). Tar Township in Akto County, Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture, is a Tajik township. Language In China, the languages of the Tajik people have no official written form. The great majority speak the Sarikoli language, which has been heavily influenced by Chinese, Uyghur and Wakhi. A small proportion speaks the Wakhi language. Sarikoli and Wakhi are Iranian languages, commonly classified in the Pamir or Eastern Iranian areal groups. Religion The Mountain Tajiks in China are adherents of the Aga Khani Nizari Ismaili sect of Shia Islam and are still a little isolated from the rest of the worldwide Ismaili community, though their communication with other Pamiri (Ismaili) peoples has never stopped. The Chinese authorities allow a few Ismaili religious buildings to function in Xinjiang's Tajik Autonomous District, whose clerics were appointed by the Chinese secular authorities. Restrictions by the Chinese government bars foreign Ismaili preachers from openly working among the Tajiks in China and the religious leader of the Nizari Ismaili sect, the Aga Khan, was once barred from business with the China's Ismailis.UNHCR Refworld, CHINA: Xinjiang's Ismailis cut off from international Ismaili community [accessed 13 May 2009] From 2‚Äì4 April 2012, His Highness the Aga Khan (Aga Khan IV), paid an official visit to √úr√ºmqi, Xinjiang, China, at the invitation of the Governor of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Mr. Nur Bekri, to discuss collaboration between the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) and the autonomous government of Xinjiang. His Highness and Governor Bekri held constructive talks in the meeting and agreed to collaborate in several thematic areas of mutual interest, including poverty alleviation, education, tourism investment and financial services. The Aga Khan IV had last visited China in 1981. China's Tajiks have been caught up in the country's crackdown on Muslims that has taken place since 2017, despite the fact that they have not tended to be politically active and the repressions have mainly targeted Uighurs. Only a single mosque is allowed to operate in the Tajik region and children under 18 are not permitted to attend it.  Culture  = Family life = In an average traditional family, at least three or more generations of relatives live under the same household. There's also a hierarchy which is determined by a family member's age and gender but the senior male stands as the head of the family. The responsibilities of the men tend to be providing for the family and looking after the children and elderly. The women's responsibilities are to raise the children, do household duties, and to attend to the elderly. The senior male is in charge of managing the entire household and the family's wealth through consulting with the rest of the men in the house. The young men are discouraged from seeking an independent life outside the household unless they get consent from the family. Failure to do so can forfeit them from inheritance. = Rites of passage and life cycles = Marriages are usually arranged by the parents of the prospective groom and bride from the asking of the daughter's hand up to the wedding. The families of the couple also decide on the dowry amount, plan the engagements and wedding dates, and choose who can attend. Some three days before the wedding, the families come together and initiate a feast for the people in the area who have lost relatives in the last year or so. These people then approve of the celebration by tapping on a hand drum. Funerals are conducted by first doing the Islamic rites of cleansing the body and praying for the deceased. This is followed by the family who burn incense and close any room or ceiling windows as this is believed to purify the path for the deceased. Every family member is expected to attend the funeral or make up for it with a visit to the family. For forty days after the burial, the closest relatives of the deceased will begin to abstain from personal comforts like by keeping their hair unkempt or uncut. On the last day, friends and family come together to bathe and clean the mourners and to convince them to return to their daily lives. = Festivals and rituals = The two main celebrations of the Tajiks of Xinjiang are the Nowruz (Persian New Year) and the Pilik festival. Right before Nowruz or \\"ched chader\\" in Sariqoli (meaning cleaning the house') begins, families rigorously clean their homes and sprinkle the inner walls with putuk (wheat flour) to wish for a successful year. Each household bakes a cake for the occasion to share with guests. The guests are welcomed on the doorstep by dusting some putuk on their right shoulder. Pilik is dedicated to commemorate the dead. Families light candles and pray for the souls of the dead while circling the light and pulling the flame towards their face. This ritual lasts two days. On the first day, families ight candles inside the house. On the second day, they visit the local cemetery and light a candle for each deceased relative and place it on their graves. Seasonal rituals like the Zuwur zoht (irrigation) and Teghm zuwost (seed sowing) used to be commonplace but presently a pir (a local religious master) or khalifa (a religious functionary who trained under a pir) blesses the agricultural implements in the fields by reciting verses from the Quran. = Livelihood = Because of the harsh and scarce environment in which the locals live in, they mostly rely on cultivating whatever arable land is available and engage in small-scale animal husbandry. Other types of subsistence also include selling traditional embroidery, clothes, hats, and other arts and crafts. However, this is only a seasonal operation. There are also a few governmental wages available but salaried jobs are few and the demand is very high.

History  The Klinkh√•mer, originally named LT Caddis (light tan), now officially named Klinkh√•mer Special, was devised by a Dutch angler Hans van Klinken in the early 80's to imitate an emerging caddisfly to catch grayling and trout which feed from them as they float in the surface film. This pattern has proven to be an extremely effective fly.  Features  Klinkh√•mers are different from many other parachute dry flies in that the thorax of the fly is designed to hang down 'through' the surface of the water to imitate an emerging insect. The abdomen serves as a trigger point which penetrates the surface film, which gets noticed by trout from great distances, even before any resulting surface footprint features. In all variations of this fly, the abdomen of the fly float is underneath the surface of the water to attract the fish and improve hookups, while the parachute hackle and foam or wing is on or above the surface of the water for visibility and flotation.

Description approved by Phil Seymour. Retrieved 2007-09-14. Boardwalk Records' founder Neil Bogart died shortly after its release, which collapsed the label (not a new experience for Seymour as Shelter Records had collapsed during the Dwight Twilley Band days), and Seymour was again without a record deal. Illness and posthumous releases In 1984, Seymour joined the Textones, a roots rock band led by Carla Olson and George Callins. With them, he recorded the Midnight Mission, and toured with them as a singer and drummer. During the tour, he noticed lumps appearing on his neck, and he was diagnosed with lymphoma. Seymour moved back to Tulsa to undergo treatment for the cancer and continued to record and play live locally, albeit at a much diminished pace, until his death on August 17, 1993 at the Tarzana Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 41. In 1996, after its acquisition of Shelter Records, EMI's The Right Stuff reissue label released Precious to Me, a 15-song Seymour collection, which served as a companion piece to Dwight Twilley's XXI collection on the same label. The album included songs from Seymour's days with The Dwight Twilley Band and the Textones as well as unreleased solo material recorded for Shelter in 1978 and with Olson and Callins in 1991 and 1992. Midnight Mission was reissued in 2001, and in 2005, Phil Seymour was reissued on CD with three bonus tracks, one each composed by Seymour, Twilley and Pitcock. Phil Seymour 2 was released by Fuel 2000 Records (Universal) on October 2011 with 10 previously unreleased bonus tracks.

The museum was founded in 1932 as the Museum of Anthropology of the University of New Mexico, becoming the first public museum in Albuquerque. In 1972 it was renamed the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology in honor of philanthropists Dorothy and Gilbert Maxwell. History The museum was established in 1932 as the Museum of Anthropology of the University of New Mexico by Edgar Lee Hewett, an active anthropologist who founded the University's anthropology department four years earlier. The museum was created to house and display the growing collection of artifacts gathered from field schools of archaeological research associated with the UNM Anthropology Department, the School of American Research, and the Museum of New Mexico. Frank C. Hibben was the first director of the museum and expanded its holdings by collecting archaeological materials from around the world and in trade with other museums. Exhibits were first situated in UNM's Rodey Hall, which was demolished in 1971. The museum moved to Scholes Hall in 1935, then to the current site in 1961. In 1972 a major construction project expanded museum facilities, which was funded by the philanthropists Dorothy and Gilbert Maxwell. The museum was renamed in their honor and since then, it has been recognized as an important regional museum and a nationally known research center. Exhibits The museum has five exhibit areas that host permanent and changing exhibits which express the human cultural experience. The Ancestors permanent exhibit traces human evolution over four million years and features life-size models of human ancestors. The People of the Southwest permanent exhibit depicts eleven thousand years of the cultural heritage of the American Southwest and features artifacts from Mimbres, Ancestral Puebloan, and Puebloan cultures, as well as displays on UNM field work in New Mexico, which includes a reconstruction of an excavation at Chaco Canyon. The museum's North Gallery, Bawden Gallery (named after Garth Bawden, museum director 1985-2005), and the Ortiz Center Gathering Space (named for the late Alfonso Ortiz, a noted UNM anthropology professor) host changing exhibits featuring artifacts from the extensive museum collection as well as traveling exhibits. The museum's courtyard features a -high totem pole brought to the museum from British Columbia in 1941.

Gustav Jenner was among his many students.  Musical career  He began his music studies with piano lessons from his father, Diederich Krug, who was himself a pianist and composer. Later, he was sent to the Leipzig Conservatory where he studied with Carl Reinecke and then went on to Berlin, where continued with Friedrich Kiel and Eduard Franck. After completing his studies, he taught in Berlin at the Stern conservatory for several years before returning to Hamburg where he remained for the rest of his life, working primarily as a music teacher and choral director.  Prize Sextet  While he wrote works in several different genres, including symphonies, orchestral overtures, operas, piano works, and chamber music, it is his choral works which received the most attention. However, today he is primarily remembered for his String Sextet in D Major, Op. 68. This string sextet was known as the ‚ÄúPrize Sextet‚Äù because Krug won the Stelzner Prize for chamber music with this composition. The Prize Sextet was originally for 2 Violins, Viola, Violotta, Cello and Cellone, but the publisher of the work (Fritz Kistner) wisely hedged his bets and produced an edition for the standard combination of 2 Violins, 2 Violas and 2 Cellos in addition to the so-called Stelzner version. Of this work, Wilhelm Altmann, the famous chamber music critic, has written: > ‚ÄúIf not a masterpiece of the highest order from start to finish, Krug‚Äôs > Sextet nonetheless comes away with high honors. He uses his themes > skillfully and his sonorities are quite successful. The first movement, > Allegro, begins with a short but powerful introduction which gives the > impression of storms ahead. Instead, the main melody is quite genial and > broad. Later, Krug cleverly weaves the introduction into the second theme > and uses it as part of the coda. The second movement, Adagio tranquillo, is > characterized by a calm, deeply felt melody, which is interrupted by an > urgent and highly dramatic middle section. There is no scherzo, but the > lively first theme to the finale, Allegro, seems to fill this gap. A quieter > and more lyrical second theme provides excellent contrast.‚Äù References * Sittard, J., Geschichte des Musik un Concertwesens in Hamburg, Altona 1890 * Altmann, Wilhelm, Handbuch f≈©r Streichquartettspieler, Wilhelmshaven 1972 * Sound-bites and short biography.

It is in the north-east of the city, approx. from Hanley. Sneyd Green borders Smallthorne in the north, Milton in the east, Birches Head in the south, and Cobridge in the west. Most of Sneyd Green falls within Stoke-on-Trent North, the remainder is in Stoke Central. For local government purposes the greater part of Sneyd Green is in the East Valley electoral ward. Those parts not in East Valley are split between 'Northwood & Birches Head' and 'Burslem South'. That part of Sneyd Green that falls within Burslem South is sometimes referred to as 'Old Sneyd Green'. There are twenty wards in the City, each with a population of around 12,000 people and each returning three elected councillors to the Council chamber. In addition to the City's electoral wards there are 49 'neighbourhood areas' of which Sneyd Green is one. These neighbourhood areas, a recent attempt by the Council to better describe the geography of the City, have been adopted by the Stoke-on-Trent Local Strategic Partnership and form the basis of the new Local Area Agreements. Community profile and facilities Wesley HallDespite having a sizeable council estate, Sneyd Green only has an average number of council tenants for a neighbourhood in Stoke-on-Trent. Also, Sneyd Green has a significantly below average proportion of residents in terraced housing.2001 Census; According to the Council's 'Neighbourhood Area Profile', Sneyd Green is \\"typified by privately owned semi-detached housing and pockets of semi- detached council-housing\\".Stoke-on-Trent City Council's Neighbourhood Area Profile (July 2006); Predictably, the average gross household income of Sneyd Green residents is higher than the City's averageCACI Ltd; and the crime rate is below the City average.Staffordshire Police, Stoke on Trent Division; The hub of the community is around the crossroad junction of Hanley Road (B5049), Milton Road and Sneyd Street. Here can be found: a busy ‚ÄòLate Shop‚Äô convenience store (A Consumers' cooperative), a doctor's surgery ‚Äì now closed, a dentist, a chemist, a sub-post office, a small number of other shops, a Chinese take-away, and an Oatcake shop. Sneyd Green's community hall on Noblett Road was one of only twelve council-owned, community-run halls in the city. Today, many of these Halls, including Sneyd Green's, are social enterprises owned by a local Trust. The Holden Lane Residents Association is one of a sizeable number of voluntary bodies that utilise the hall's facilities. Sneyd Green has two primary schools (Holden Lane and Sneyd Green), a large secondary school (Excel Academy) and two churches (St. Andrews Church of England Parish and Wesley Hall Methodist Church on Noblett Road). There are two public houses in Sneyd Green (the Berwick and the Sneyd Arms ‚Äì a third, the Holden Bridge being recently demolished) and a Workingmen's Club (Holden Lane WMC on Ralph Drive ‚Äì member of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union ). Central Forest Park Sculpture in Central Forest Park The huge Central Forest Park can be found on the south-west fringe of Sneyd Green. In the early 1970s Central Forest Park was created by the City Council from three enormous coal spoil heaps, deep mine shafts, water-filled marl pits, disused railways and decaying buildings. At the time it won conservation awards for land reclamation. Today it is a very pleasant park allowing for a variety of recreational pastimes including angling, cycling, and skate-boarding. Holden Lane Pools The Holden Lane Pools is a local nature reserve covering an area of eight and a half hectares. There is young woodland, marshy reed beds, grassland and the main pool, popular with anglers, covers approximately four acres of water and is tree lined around most of its perimeter. The Ford Green Brook, a tributary of the River Trent, flows through a conservation area where angling is not permitted. Some remains of a disused branch of the Caldon Canal (‚ÄòThe Foxley') can also be found on the site. There is also a footpath, along the trackbed of the former Biddulph Valley railway line (of the North Staffordshire Railway), to Ford Green Hall. Holden Lane pool The Pools can be found in the north-east of Sneyd Green, nestled between the A53 on one side and Holden Lane High School on the other. The main Hanley to Leek bus service passes the site. The Friends of Holden Lane Pools were established in January 2004. They work with the City Council's Environment Team to manage the site for wildlife and people. According to the Environment team, the site currently supports \\"a wide variety of birds including great crested and little grebes, swans, coots and moorhens. A range of small birds can be seen in the woodland and reed beds. Other wildlife includes grass snakes, which shelter and hunt for frogs in the grassland and marshy areas, plus dragonflies and butterflies\\". Anglers come seeking one of the several carp over that the main pool holds. Local bands Local bands from this area include Indie/Rock/Alternative band Maybe This Friday and The Decision. Also from the area is Nick Barber, the lead singer of Elvis Fontenot and the Sugar Bees, who won European Zydeco band of the year in 2006 and who have played three times in the USA and twice in Europe at major festivals as well as headlining venues all over the UK. Taz Cool, frontwoman of funk-grunge outfit Ylang Dog Riot, is an active member of the Sneyd Green community. Members of AggyFro, who reached the Final of the Official Live & Unsigned competition in 2011 and were regularly played on BBC Stoke, come from Sneyd Green and the surrounding Stoke area. Trivia Leek New Road, which goes through Sneyd Green passing under the Holden Viaduct, forms part of the A53 that stretches from Shrewsbury (Shropshire) to Buxton (Derbyshire) via Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stoke-on-Trent, and Leek. In the Pennines, the A52 reaches an altitude of over above sea level. Not surprisingly, the road is often blocked by snow in the winter. In better weather, keen ramblers and campers from all over North Staffordshire pass through Sneyd Green in their cars on their way to the Peak District. Sneyd Green is named after the prominent local Sneyd family. Keele University was built on the former estate of the Sneyd family.http://www.keele.ac.uk/aboutus/ourhistory/ Keele University History There are a number of prominent historical Sneyds of Keele Hall, such as Ralph Sneyd and William Sneyd.

Baseball career Sarni attended Los Angeles High School; he threw and batted right- handed, stood tall and weighed . His professional baseball career began in at the age of 15 when he played for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League. In 33 games he went 19-for-83 (.229) with one home run and nine runs batted in. Sarni led Texas League catchers with a .991 fielding percentage while playing for the Shreveport Sports in . He led American Association catchers with 597 putouts and a .989 fielding percentage while playing for the Columbus Red Birds in . Sarni made his major league debut with the Cardinals on May 11, 1951 at the age of 23. After hitting for only a .174 average during his rookie year, Sarni was sent back to the Columbus Red Birds in May 1952 in order to trim their roster down to the 25 player limit. He posted a .277 batting average along with 8 home runs and 60 runs batted in during the season with Columbus and, earned a spot on the American Association All-Star team. In October 1953, the Cardinals purchased Sarni from Columbus. Sarni became the Cardinals starting catcher when Del Rice was injured during a play at home plate on June 7, 1954. In 123 games he posted a .300 batting average with 9 home runs and 70 runs batted in. He also led National League catchers with a .996 fielding percentage and 12 double plays. One odd footnote from the 1954 season was a game in St. Louis on July 18 against the Philadelphia Phillies in which, both Sarni and Phillies catcher Stan Lopata played the game without wearing chest protectors because of the intense heat. The Cardinals traded Rice to the Milwaukee Braves in June 1955 and, Sarni became their number one catcher. Although his batting average dipped to .255 in , he was hitting above .300 in early June 1956 when, the Cardinals traded him to the New York Giants along with Jackie Brandt, Dick Littlefield and Red Schoendienst for Alvin Dark, Ray Katt, Don Liddle and Whitey Lockman. Sarni took over as the Giants starting catcher and ended the year leading the league's catchers with 61 assists and 10 double plays. During spring training in 1957 he suffered a heart attack that ended his playing career.Mid-Career Tragedies, by Bill Bryson, Baseball Digest, April 1958, Vol. 17, No. 3, ISSN 0005-609X He was just 29 years old.

Born in the United States, Master Henry began playing on the streets of Chicago. While a young man he performed for Operation Push with Rev. Jesse Jackson. Later he became an integral member of Phil Cohran's revolutionary Artistic Heritage Ensemble. Later Gibson played and recorded with the popular jazz ensemble Odell Brown and the Organizers. Gibson spent a lot of time in Chicago recording studios, which allowed him to be noticed and picked up by professional musicians who took him on tour. One tour led to another, and soon he was playing and recording with artists such as Donny Hathaway (Everything Is Everything) and Curtis Mayfield. Gibson chose to go on the road with Curtis Mayfield and this led to his success and national recognition for his artistry on the bongo and conga drums. Master Henry performed in the Hawaiian Islands in the mid 70's and 80's, making the island of Oahu his home. He teamed with musician, songwriter and producer Kirk Thompson to record the iconic \\"Lemuria\\" album and collaborated with many of the top local Waikiki musicians of that era, incl: vocalist, Azure McCall and pianist, Tennyson Stevens. He was an integral part of Kirk Thompson's 'Super Session' with Michael 'Papabax' Baxter on keys, John Gallarde on bass and Ron Felix on drums. Master Henry was a popular addition to the Waikiki music scene in those years. While performing at the Hard Rock Cafe in Stockholm, Sweden, he met and later married his wife Anne, and made Stockholm his base. He died in Stockholm of a heart attack at age 60. His last concert appearance was with Khaled Habib and Zak Keith at the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm. His distinctive style can be heard among other recordings, on Curtis Mayfield's \\"Pusherman.\\" An unsung Soul artist, Henry felt he had more than paid his dues. In his later years, he was less and less content with being a sideman and began asserting himself as the main attraction, placing his percussion at the forefront of shows. He was known for getting upset with audiences in noisy venues ‚Äî after demanding their silence and full attention, he would instantly regain his focus and proceed to put on spellbinding performances on the bongos.
