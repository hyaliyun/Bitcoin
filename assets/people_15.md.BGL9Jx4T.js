It is one of the best-known bushwalking sites in Australia. The forest is located within the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Greater Blue Mountains Area. The forest survived through the efforts of early Australian conservationists. Natural history Grose River, near the Blue Gum Forest. A sign on the Perrys Lookdown track at the Blue Gum Forest. The forest consists predominantly of towering Mountain blue gum (Eucalyptus deanei) trees, with an understory of shrubs. The forest can be accessed only on foot, with several trails from different parts of the Grose Valley and adjacent canyons meeting in the forest. The most direct route into the forest from Blackheath is by the Perrys Lookdown track, which descends to the forest. The return walk uphill is rated as \\"hard\\". A large mountain blue gum tree measuring high with a trunk in circumference grows in the Blue Gum Forest. Being over 600 years old, it is a local landmark for bushwalkers. this tree was measured in 2012 with a Nikon Laser Rangefinder; tall. However trees over tall grow in other parts of the forest Because of the effects of trampling, camping is permitted at nearby Acacia Flat, not in the Blue Gum Forest itself. = Flora = While the forest is dominated by Eucalyptus deanei, other eucalyptus trees are present. Smaller trees and shrubs include paperbarks (Melaleuca styphelioides), various acacias and the Yellow Pittosporum (Pittosporum revolutum). Grasses, vines, orchids (Caladenia picta), and ferns grow on the forest floor. = Fauna = Common brushtail possums, greater gliders, eastern grey kangaroos, spotted-tail quoll and rock wallabies are some of the many mammal species in the forest. Birds are often encountered, either at the forest floor or in and above the canopy. Parrots such as the crimson rosella and yellow-tailed black cockatoo are conspicuous. = Fire = Most of the trees are considered to be around 300 years old, possibly originating from a large bush fire. Regular light or moderate fires promote eucalyptus regeneration and stop the invasion of rainforest trees, but severe fires damage the forest. The Grose Valley has been affected by bushfires at various times, notably in 1982 and in November 2006. In particular the Blue Gum Forest was damaged by back burning. Following the harsh bushfires in 2006, the Blue Gum Forest and other walking tracks in the valley were closed to bushwalkers to allow the regrowth of vegetation.  History  = Indigenous Australians = In 1804, the explorer George Caley climbed nearby Mount Banks, and noticed camp fires from Indigenous Australians. The Blue Mountains was part of the territories of the Darug people. There is also evidence of associations of the more westerly Wiradjuri and the southern Gandangara people with the Blue Mountains. Aboriginal tool-making and signs of occupation have been found in the Grose Valley, some of it close to the Blue Gum Forest. = 1850s and 1860s = In around 1858, the Royal Engineers built of bridle track for the proposed railway line. However, this was abandoned in favour of the current line on the ridge. The Engineers Track, as it was known, became a navigational point for walkers, farmers and explorers. Robert Hunt took some of the earliest Australian photographs in the forest in 1859. Ben Carver, a cattle rustler, also used the track in the 1860s, and later bought a lease on the area in 1875. Only a small section of the Engineers Track survives today. = Artist's camp and the Horderns = In 1875, the Blue Gum Forest was the scene of an artists‚Äô camp established by Frederick Eccleston Du Faur of the Academy of Art. Over twenty artists, photographers and academics camped in the forest. Several photographs by Alex Bischoff, and drawings and paintings by William Piguenit resulted. Another outcome was that the whole Grose Valley and surrounds was reserved from alienation because it was ‚Äòa national spectacle‚Äô. At the time there was no national park in Australia, and indeed Australia was not even a nation‚Äîbut the reservation was the country‚Äôs first \\"national park\\". However, this reservation status did not stop subsequent threats to the forest. The wealthy retail family the Horderns purchased a lease in the Blue Gum Forest, though they had no plans to develop the area. Jokingly, this part of the valley was known as \\"the Hordern Pavilion\\". = Early conservation = The Grose Valley became the cradle of the modern conservation movement in New South Wales when the Blue Gum Forest was saved from threatened destruction in 1931‚Äì32. At Easter in 1931, a group from the Sydney Bush Walkers Club, led by Alan Rigby, were camped in the forest when they chanced upon a Bilpin farmer, Clarrie Hungerford. Hungerford had a lease of the forest and told the bushwalkers he planned to clear the blue gums to plant walnuts. Other threats to the forest included a proposed railway line, a dam, a power station and mining for coal and shale. The bushwalkers went away and started a campaign to stop him. Eventually, they raised A¬£130 which they paid Hungerford in exchange for his relinquishing the lease. They met with Hungerford at the Blue Gum Forest on 15 November 1931 in pouring rain, and he agreed with their suggestion. It was a substantial amount at the height of the great depression. A¬£80 came in the form of an interest-free loan from James Cleary, then head of the NSW railways and later chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Cleary was also a bushwalker. One of the key activists in the campaign was Myles Dunphy, who at the time was developing his plans for the Blue Mountains National Park. 273x273px See also * Protected areas of New South Wales * Blue Mountains walking tracks  References   External links  *Penrithweb.com: Panorama of the Blue Gum Forest Category:Forests of New South Wales Category:Parks and reserves of the Blue Mountains (New South Wales) Category:Australian art ","title":"Blue Gum Forest"},{"id":"61745955","text":"Strandegaard is a manor house and estate located in Faxe Municipality, Denmark. The estate was acquired by Otto Thott and two sisters in 1631 and is still owned by the Thott/Reedtz-Thott family. It is managed as an organic farm and other activities include Feddet Beach Camping & Resort. History =Early history= Strandeg√•rd Manor was established by Axel Sehested in 1662 at the site where the village of Fiskerhoved had until then been located. The area had until then belonged to the Crown but was by Frederick III presented to Sehested after the Second Northern War. Sehested later that same year sold the estate to a merchant from Copenhagen named Hans Pedersen Klein. Petersen Klein's widow Magdalene Mogensdatter was after her husband's death second time married to Ernst Volcher. In 1686, Magdalene Mogensdatter sold Strandeg√•rd to merchant Peder Jensen. His widow, Kirsten Ellen Andersdatter, kept the estate until her death in 1707. Strandegaard was then sold in public auction to Christian Juel. His widow, Anne Margrethe Krag, kept the estate after her husband's death in 1717, In 1731, after struggling economically for years, like many other landowners of the time, she had to sell Strandegaard. =Thott family= Otto Thott The new owners were Otto Thott and his sisters Dorothea and Anne Thott. Otto Thott was already the owner of the estates Gavn√∏ and Lindersvold. Dorothea Thott passed away in 1738 and Otto Thott bought Anne Thott in 1740. Otto Thott had no children. In his will of 1780, he converted his estates into a stamhus for his maternal uncle's grandson, Holger Reedtz, who in 1786 took the name Reedtz-Thott. The legal effect of a stamhus was that the estate could not be pledged, sold or divided between heirs. In 1805, Otto Reedtz-Thott was able to establish the Barony of Gavn√∏ from the estates. His son, Tage Reedtz-Thott, succeeded his father in 1862. He was active in politics and served as Council President from 1785 to 1786. The barony was dissolved in 1921. This happened in accordance with the lensafl√∏sningslov of 1919. Tage Reedtz-Thott's son. Otto Reedtz-Thott, succeeded his father in 1923 but already died in 1927. He had no children and Strandeg√•rd was therefore passed to a cousin, Holger Reedtz-Thott, while another cousin's son, Axel Reedtz-Thott, received Gavn√∏. Holger Reedtz-Thott had no children and therefore left Strandeg√•rd to Axel Reedtz-Thott Axel Reedtz-Thott ceded Strandeg√•rd to his youngest son Ivan Reedtz-Thott in 1978. His eldest son, His elder son, Otto Reedtz-Thott, had succeeded him on Gavn√∏ in 1973. Today The Strandeg√•rd estate in 2020 The estate has a total area of approximately 1,300 hectares of which just over half is farmland and the rest is forest and other natural habitats. Strandegaard is managed as an organic farm. Other activities include Feddet Beach Camping & Resort.

Size (1883-February 1959) was an Anglo-Irish penal reformer and officer in the English prison system in the early to mid-twentieth century, considered one of \\"the great reformers\\" of the prison system for women in England at this time.  Early Life  Mary Size was born in Galway, Ireland in 1883. Mary began her career as an English teacher at a local school in County Galway in the early 1900s, before immigrating to England. Size would return to Galway during the holidays and test the children on what they had learned. After Size became Deputy Governor of Holloway Prison in 1927, she gave the children from her former school clothes made by the Holloway prisoners.  Early career in the English prison service  After moving to England in 1906 at the age of 23, Size became a prison warder and initially spent two months of probation work as an officer in Manchester Prison before moving to Aylesbury Prison to receive hospital work training \\"from the only fully-trained nurse in the [prison] service. In 1912, Size was appointed school mistress to the Borstal school at Aylesbury Prison, where she had initial difficulties in establishing a system to adequately contain and care for these troubled girls, who numbered about fifty, at the school - in part due to her pupil's different social backgrounds, their physical and mental condition, and their previous education. While living in Aylesbury, Size was an active member of the local Roman Catholic community. Size later worked at Leeds Prison. Accommodation for female officers working in the English prison system in the early twentieth century was often an afterthought and this was no less true for Size's early work: her first room at Manchester Prison adjoined a prisoner's cell and after outside accommodation in Leeds ended, Size was found some space in a store cell at Leeds Prison. More generally, most prison staff accommodation (especially in female wings), were converted cells at the ends of corridors or landings, or rooms in the hospital.  Liverpool, Holloway and Aylesbury Prisons, 1925-1942 Size eventually worked her way up to become the Lady Superintendent at Liverpool Prison in 1925, where she \\"took with her an ethos developed in the reformatory borstal system.\\" Size was also working in the a changing context for the imprisonment of women in the English penal system: when she first joined in the early 1900s, a large number of women were imprisoned for short sentences. By the 1920s, the introduction of fines in lieu of short prison sentences in combination with the introduction of old age pensions led to a significant decrease in the female prison population, in particular those serving short sentences. Around May 1927, Size was appointed Deputy Governor at Holloway Prison (which had become a women's only prison in 1902) and was the first woman to hold the post and the only woman in the UK to hold an equivalent role. By 1934, Holloway was the largest women's prison in the UK, holding 370 women prisoners out of a total population of about 800 women prisoners across all UK prisons. While Deputy Governor at Holloway, Size introduced a whole range of important reforms including considerable improvements in routine and in methods of classification at the prison. Size's appointment was part of a wider programme of penal reform and she was appointed with a brief to make Holloway \\"the best women‚Äôs prison in the country.\\" This reform programme of women's prisons in England in the late 1920s and into the 1930s brought about educational improvements and a new stress on the importance of femininity with mirrors being allowed in cells, more feminine wall colours, and allowing female inmates to purchase cosmetics and make-up. Previously, some female prisoners at Holloway had used cooking-flour or distemper scraped from a wall as face powder and red dye from prison library books for rouge. Other reforms put in place by Size included the converting an exercise yard at Holloway into a rose garden, where female prisoners could be trained in gardening - a skill which could be put to use in domestic service after their release from prison. More generally, Size developed handicrafts, modernised uniforms, established a canteen, introduced gardening and evening classes. Size served as Deputy Governor at Holloway Prison until 1941; both staff and prisoners were evacuated to Aylesbury Prison at the outbreak of the Second World War. Between 1941 and 1942, Size was Governor of Aylesbury Prison, where Size arranged for prisoners to knit comforts for men and women which were sent to the Red Cross Depot at Oxford for distribution. In June 1941, Size was appointed a member of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the King's Birthday Honours List in recognition of her work on prison reform. In 1942, Size retired from the prison service \\"for health reasons\\" after thirty-six years' service.  Askham Grange open prison, 1946-1952  In 1946, Size came out of retirement and rejoined the prison service to become the first Governor of the new Askham Grange Open Prison, opened in January 1947. Askham Grange was the first women's open prison, a new, controversial, and experimental type of prison - \\"a prison-without-bars.\\" In 1950, Size noted that of the 220 women discharged from Askham Grange prison, only six had been re-convicted and added that she was even prouder still that a female prisoner had said to her \\"How wonderful it is to be treated as a human being again.\\" In 1951, English writer Joan Henry was imprisoned at Holloway and Askram Grange, the latter under Size who she later described in her 1952 book Who lie in gaol as \\"a mixture of discipline and humanity.\\" Historian and academic Dr Ann D. Smith described Smith as, \\"a sincerely religious woman [and] dedicated to her work ... Miss Size's understanding of the needs, problems and frailties of the prisoners under her care enabled her to initiate countless small reforms of routine and treatment during her periods of office at Liverpool and Holloway and, eventually, as Governor of Askham Grange. In 1952, Size retired from the prison service for a second and final time. Around the time of her second retirement, one of her former 'girls' (female prisoners) referred to Size as \\"the Elizabeth Fry of this generation.\\"  Later Life  In 1957, Size published her memoirs on her career and long service in aid of penal reform Prisons I have known. Throughout her time in the English prison service, Size stressed the need for a more sympathetic and humane approach to prisoner reform and that to humiliate or degrade the prisoner was to crush any self- respect or morality they may have originally possessed. Instead, she believed in humanising, supporting, and educating prisoners during their time in the penal system. Size's death at age 76 was announced in early February 1959.

His music has been performed in the UK, Ireland, Germany, France, and Iceland, and has won prizes including the Royal Philharmonic Society Composition Prize.  Early life and education  Mawhinney was born in County Down, Northern Ireland in 1976. As a student, he studied music at the University of Oxford, the University of York and Queen's University Belfast, the latter of which he has held the position of senior lecturer in composition since 2006.  Musical career  Throughout his musical career, Mawhinney has used a range of compositional techniques, drawing on the post-spectral and New Complexity movements. He has also been interested in computer-assisted composition, specifically using OpenMusic, a software developed by the French company IRCAM. Mawhinney draws particular inspiration from the music of Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez, stating that Boulez's D√©rive 2 is a pinnacle of contemporary music. He has also been influenced by the works of Kaikhosru Sorabji.Roberge, Marc-Andr√© (29 June 2020). \\"Musical and Literary Homages and Dedications\\". Sorabji Resource Site. Retrieved 30 July 2020. He has a particular interest in music with extended duration, with inspiration from composers such as Morton Feldman.

He was a member of Wilhelm Filchner's Second German Antarctic Expedition, 1911‚Äì13, which failed in its attempt to determine the nature of the link, if any, between the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea, and thereby resolve the question as to whether the continent was a single landmass or a group of several elements. In the course of the expedition K√∂nig, along with Filchner, was part of the group, that disproved the existence of the land known as New South Greenland, or \\"Morrell's Land\\", supposedly discovered in 1823 by the American sealer captain, Benjamin Morrell. On his return to Austria, K√∂nig sought to continue Filchner's unfinished work, and for this purpose organised an Austrian Antarctic Expedition, which he hoped would depart in the summer of 1914. However, he found that his plans conflicted with those of Ernest Shackleton, who was concurrently preparing the Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition on similar lines. Attempts to reconcile the two ventures failed; in the event, K√∂nig's expedition was abandoned in August 1914 on the outbreak of the First World War, in which he served as an officer in the Austrian army. He was captured, and spent most of the conflict as a prisoner- of-war in Siberia. He never returned to the Antarctic. Personal background Felix K√∂nig, born around 1880, was a scientist and alpinist from Graz in Austria. He had acquired some experience of the Arctic in Greenland, and in 1911 he was invited to join Wilhelm Filchner's Second German Antarctic Expedition, 1911‚Äì13. In the Antarctic, 1911‚Äì13 Wilhelm Filchner The main geographical objective of this expedition was to determine the relationship between the eastern and western landmasses of Antarctica; were they connected by land, or were there two landmasses separated by water? The expedition would involve travel over uncharted terrain, in which K√∂nig's alpine experiences might be a valuable asset. The expedition ship, Deutschland, entered the Weddell Sea in January 1912, and penetrated to 77¬∞44'S. The ship reached an inlet, which Filchner named Vahsel Bay, after Deutschland's captain, Richard Vahsel. Here he set attempted to up his Weddell Sea base camp, unfortunately on insecure ice; changes in the winds and tides caused the berg to break free, carrying the camp with it. Most of its equipment was retrieved, but after several attempts to re-establish the base the ship became caught in the ice and began to drift northwards. The expedition then endured a long, frustrating winter trapped in the Weddell Sea ice. The question as to whether overall control of the expedition lay with Filchner, or with the more experienced Vahsel ‚Äì he had been second officer on the Gauss Expedition of 1901‚Äì03 ‚Äì had not been satisfactorily resolved, and created a situation of divided command. Factions formed behind these alternative leaders, followed by animosities and threats of violence. K√∂nig, firmly aligned with Filchner, alleged that he had been shot at; Filchner slept behind locked doors with a loaded pistol by his side, for protection. Weddell Sea iceberg in the region of supposed \\"New South Greenland\\" During the course of the winter drift, K√∂nig participated with Filchner in an ice journey to investigate the location of land reportedly sighted by the American sealer Benjamin Morrell in 1823. This involved a hazardous trek over nearly 40 miles of treacherous sea ice. They found no trace of the land, and depth soundings confirmed that there was no land nearby. Deutschland finally escaped from the ice in late October 1912, and reached South Georgia on 19 December. Here, the expedition dissolved; back in Germany, Filchner was largely exonerated from blame for the debacle, but had lost his taste for polar exploration, and decided to return to his original field of work, in Central and East Asia. Proposed Austrian Antarctic Expedition Back in Austria, and undiscouraged by Filchner's failures, K√∂nig was ready to return to the Antarctic to continue the work. He began to organise the Austrian Antarctic Expedition, and with the backing of the influential Count Johann Wilczek, was able to buy Deutschland, the name of which he changed to Osterreich. His plans were supported by Filchner and, among others, Roald Amundsen and Otto Nordenskj√∂ld. K√∂nig also obtained the blessing of the Austrian imperial family. Ernest Shackleton However, K√∂nig faced competition. Since his return in from his polar near-miss in 1909, Ernest Shackleton had been considering a further journey south. In March 1912 he learned that Amundsen had reached the South Pole. With that goal removed, the idea of a trans-Antarctic crossing became his objective, something he had previously discussed with William Speirs Bruce, leader of the erstwhile Scottish National Antarctic Expedition 1902‚Äì04, whose own plans to make such a crossing had been stalled by lack of finance. When, in January 1913, Shackleton learned that Filchner had failed in his principal objective, he felt free to develop his own scheme, based on the establishment of winter quarters in Vahsel Bay. Meanwhile, in Austria, K√∂nig formally revealed his plans to a committee meeting of the Austrian Geographical Society in January 1914. The 1914 meeting noted that Shackleton was proposing a similar plan, meaning that two expeditions, with broadly similar objectives, would be operating in the same area of the Antarctic at the same time. K√∂nig's reaction was to claim that Filchner had transferred to him his rights of priority in the Vahsel Bay area, and that Shackleton should therefore go elsewhere. The former president of the Royal Geographical Society, Sir Clements Markham, still an influential figure, concurred: \\"One has to leave the area to K√∂nig where he has worked in former times\\". This stance was similar to what Shackleton had experienced with Captain Scott, prior to the Nimrod Expedition in 1907, when Scott had claimed priority in the McMurdo Sound area of the Ross Sea and demanded that Shackleton find another base. Shackleton then had reluctantly deferred to Scott only to be forced by circumstances, when in the Antarctic, to break his promise and establish his base within McMurdo Sound. Now, Shackleton was determined he would not yield, and informed the Royal Geographical Society: \\"I have as much right to use Vahsel Bay as Dr. K√∂nig ... I cannot alter plans I have long since formulated\\". As the scheduled departure dates of both expeditions approached in the summer of 1914, attempts were made to get the two ventures to either combine or at least cooperate. Filchner invited Shackleton to Berlin, to discuss the situation, but Shackleton was too distracted by last-minute preparations for his expedition, and could not find the time. He suggested that K√∂nig should come to London. Events were then overtaken by the crisis developing in Europe; on 3 August, with war imminent, Shackleton's ship Endurance was moored at Ramsgate, awaiting instructions from the Admiralty. There, he received from the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, the one-word instruction \\"Proceed\\". As K√∂nig waited with his ship in Trieste harbour on the outbreak of war, he was ordered to abandon his expedition. First World War K√∂nig joined the Austrian army, fought in Galicia, and in September 1915 was captured and sent to Krasnoyarsk in Siberia as a prisoner of war. During his long captivity, the scientific community made unavailing attempts to secure his release. K√∂nig finally escaped in June 1918, but never returned to the Antarctic. His name, however, is perpetuated in the region by the K√∂nig Glacier in South Georgia, named in 1929 by a German expedition to the island. Osterreich was requisitioned for use by the Austro- Hungarian Navy as a minesweeper, and served until she was sunk by a torpedo in the Adriatic Sea in 1917.

It advocates the needs of the Western Sydney region by facilitating communication between Sydney's key opinion leaders in education, government and the wider community. The Dialogue works closely with a broad range of organisations, including the Western Sydney Business Chamber, Western Sydney Community Forum, Western Sydney University (WSU) and various state and local government groups.  Background  The Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue was founded by Christopher Brown, AM, and launched in 2015 by Mike Baird, who was the New South Wales premier at the time. Since then, the Regional Advocacy has focused on creating discussion between key stakeholders about current issues affecting Sydney's west. The Dialogue has worked closely with government and has released various reports on key issues with a view to facilitating political, academic and cultural discussion.  Patrons  Christopher Brown AM (member of the WSU Board of Trustees) is both founder and chairman of the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue. Adam Leto is the executive director. Current patrons include: * the Hon. Nick Greiner AC * Mr Cameron Clyne * the Hon. Craig Knowles AM * Dr Kerry Schott AO * Professor Peter Shergold AC (UWS Chancellor)  Initiatives  In March 2016, the Dialogue held its first conference, named the Out There Summit. The goal was to share a new vision for Western Sydney, which included discussion about transport initiatives, the western Sydney airport and urban renewal. Speakers included Malcolm Turnbull (prime minister at the time), Mike Baird (NSW premier at the time) and Lucy Turnbull (chief of the Greater Sydney Commission). This was followed by Boomtown! Summit in November 2016. The conference was held to showcase future projects for the Western Sydney region. WSLD partnered with Transport for NSW to host the conference and outlined plans for the Sydney Metro West, Parramatta Light Rail and Western Sydney Airport projects. In 2017, the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue pushed for Sydney's West to hold the 2030 Commonwealth Games. According to Chairman Christopher Brown, western Sydney would have benefited from hosting the games, as it would create a deadline for major transport projects in Western Sydney to be completed. In March 2019, the Dialogue released a report on domestic abuse in Western Sydney. The report makes recommendations to tackle the high rate of domestic abuse in the region, including paid domestic violence leave and a royal commission. In May 2019, the not-for-profit released a report titled Western Sydney's Heavy Issue with a view to facilitating political discussion on tackling obesity in western Sydney. The report advocates a 5-point plan that focuses on prevention with a view to decreasing pressure on Western Sydney's healthcare system. In July 2019, the Regional Advocacy released a guide titled Best of the West. It provides readers with a snapshot of regional events, popular places, infrastructure and innovations in Western Sydney. In August 2019, the Dialogue released a report titled Stuck in the Middle. The report focuses on a structural overhaul of the central Sydney region with an aim to improve infrastructure and stimulate growth. Key recommendations include the negotiation of a new City Deal and appointment of a Central City Coordinator General. The not-for-profit supports the Greater Sydney Commission's vision of the Sydney Metropolis and has recommended action to improve the central Sydney region to ensure it competes well with the East and West. In September 2019, delegates from the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue completed a 4-day East London Study Tour. The goal of the tour was to hear about London's regeneration efforts after the 2012 Summer Olympics. The visit included a discussion about social housing provision and the benefit of developers and councils working together to meet community needs.  Advocacy  Since its launch, the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue has focused its lobbying efforts on a range of projects, including the north‚Äìsouth rail, SBS relocation, value capture, social issues and local government reform, for Western Sydney. = North‚Äìsouth rail = In 2016, the Dialogue joined Western Sydney councils and major landowners to establish the Western Sydney Rail Alliance to lobby for a north‚Äìsouth rail connection in Western Sydney. The proposed rail connection would connect to the new Badgerys Creek Airport. According to the report A network of opportunity‚ÄìWestern Sydney Rail by Deloitte and Arup, a north‚Äìsouth rail connection would boost employment hubs in Western Sydney and promote economic growth. In 2018, government approved $7bn in funding for a new rail connection from St Marys to Badgerys Creek Airport. = SBS relocation = The Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue advocated the push for SBS headquarters to relocate to Western Sydney. The lobby group pushed for Western Sydney councils to suggest potential headquarters and propose a deal. = Social issues = The Dialogue advocates on social issues, such as obesity, diabetes, homelessness and domestic violence. = Value capture = The Regional Advocacy supports the idea of private sector contributions to the cost of public infrastructure through value capture. According to the Dialogue, federal funding, value capture, privatisation and borrowing are all needed to successfully transform Western Sydney. = Local government reform = The Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue advocates radical local government reform to encourage best practice in Western Sydney. In a collaboration with Sydney Business Chamber, the Regional Advocacy released a report titled Governance Reform for Growth in 2018. The report proposed a City of Parramatta act and a new planning committee similar to the Central City Planning Committee.

She was one of five activists that made up the Big Five of Bayview. Life and career Westbrook was born in Gatesville, Texas in 1915. She moved to San Francisco in 1949 where she worked as a supervisor at the city's Economic Opportunity Council. After San Francisco embarked on a large-scale redevelopment plan in 1959, thousands of low-income residents were displaced and no new affordable housing was constructed. Westbrook joined the Hunters Point-Bayview Joint Housing Committee to petition the government to include affordable housing. She soon replaced activist Ruth Williams as head of the committee. In 1968, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for funds to build new low-income and middle- income housing in the Bay Area. Due to the efforts of Westbrook and the other Big Five of Bayview, the Hunters Point neighborhood project was allotted $40 million in funding in 1971. In 1973, she testified in front of the Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs of the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Throughout the early 1970s, Westbrook lobbied the city of San Francisco to open a free medical clinic in Potrero Hill. The Caleb G. Clark Potrero Hill Health Center opened in 1976. Death and legacy She died in her home on September 13, 2011. She was interred next to her husband at the Golden Gate National Cemetery. At her funeral on September 21, 2011, she was eulogized by Mayor Ed Lee and former mayor Willie Brown, who said \\"she used to scare me\\" by demanding he answer her calls and showing up at his office unannounced. Actor Danny Glover, who worked with Westbrook as part of the Model Cities Program, also spoke at her funeral. The Westbrook Plaza Health Center And Housing Complex, which opened three months before her death, is named for Westbrook. San Francisco author William Delaney, one of the first African-American police officers in San Francisco, dedicated his 2011 autobiography to her. In 2007, director Kevin Gordon released a documentary short about her life titled \\"Tellin' It Like It Is: The Work of Elouise Westbrook\\".

A library's discovery layer includes a search box that library users can type queries into, similar to a web search engine. In library science, this searching is called discovery. The results from discovery may include books and other print materials from the library's catalog, electronic resources such as e-journals or videos, and items stored in other libraries. The word \\"layer\\" indicates that the software is modular‚Äîit is front-end software, separable from an integrated library system (ILS). Terminology The term discovery layer has been described as an overarching term that can include: * Discovery interface, a graphical user interface that library users search or browse with. It includes search-engine like amenities such as spelling correction, tolerance for punctuation differences, and typeahead search. This idea is also called a next-generation catalog. * Discovery system, an interconnected search system, allowing library users to search not only the catalog of library print materials, but various digital resources and perhaps resources located in other libraries. The discovery system queries more than one data source upon a single user request; this is sometimes called federated search. The term discovery layer can be used to stress \\"the ‚Äòdecoupling‚Äô of catalog search and browse functionality from the integrated library management system (ILS).\\" The distinction between discovery layer, interface, and system is not rigorous and the terms are sometimes used as synonyms. These \\"inconsistencies were in part due to the field‚Äôs newness\\" when the terms were being created. History =OPACs= Users searching for print materials (such as books) at a library once used card catalogs, and later computerized catalogs called OPACs. Searching for resources other than material in the catalog, such as electronic resources, was (or is) done with separate tools. Using card or computerized catalogs well required skills and jargon particular to libraries. As computerization advanced, OPACs were integrated with other library systems, like acquisition and circulation systems. The resulting monolithic software systems were named integrated library systems. =Changing expectations= As the web became more widespread, library users developed \\"the expectation of being able to discover the collection in a search engine style.\\" Gradually, discovery interfaces were created to be more forgiving of misspellings and punctuation choices than historical OPACs, and to offer features like suggestion of related search terms and faceted search. Reference librarians in the mid-2000s also spent \\"a lot of time talking about information silos.\\" They were concerned that library users had to hunt for various types of resources with various tools, an obstacle to users, resulting in underused resources. Librarians sought multidatabase search products that would collapse the silos. =Emergence of the discovery layer= These two features, search-engine-like interfaces and multidatabase search, began to appear in the same software systems. One author dates the uniting of these features to 2009; this would be the invention of the discovery system. Particularly if decoupled from an ILS, this united product can also be called a discovery layer. \\"The discovery layer still uses the information and indexing in the integrated library system (ILS), but it also searches across proprietary databases and other electronic resources, all with the goal of revealing everything that a library owns or has licensed on a given topic be it a print monograph, an electronic journal article, streaming video, or a collection of archival documents\\" The discovery layer can be looked on as the replacement for the OPAC. Some libraries maintain both a catalog interface OPAC and a discovery layer interface. Examples Some discovery layer or discovery service products are modules of a particular ILS or database product, and are sold by that product's vendor. An example is EBSCO Discovery Service. Other discovery tools are free-standing software products. Blacklight and VuFind are open-source examples.

Early life and education  Edstr√∂m was born in Gothenburg. She studied chemistry at Uppsala University and earned her doctoral degree in 1990. For her doctoral research, Edstr√∂m worked with Josh Thomas on solid electrolytes including beta-alumina. She was appointed as research assistant at Uppsala University in 1995. At the time she was interested in designing materials with special properties. She worked with Ericsson Mobile Communications on lithium- ion batteries for mobile phones.  Research and career  Edstr√∂m works on batteries and novel electrode materials. She has worked on lithium-ion, lithium‚Äìair and sodium-ion batteries. Her research has particularly considered new anode materials, using photoemission spectroscopy to identify the impact of interlayers and interfaces. When rechargeable batteries are charged and discharged they lose a little of their capacity. This degradation could be cause by crystals that form at the electrodes. Edstr√∂m's recent work has considered self-repairing batteries using polymers. Polymers can form weak hydrogen bonds with other polymer chains or the surfaces of electrodes. Edstr√∂m has proposed using polymers on the surface of electrodes in an effort to stop them from cracking. She has synthesised a range of polymers and investigated them using spectroscopic electrochemistry as well as modelling the interfaces between the electrode and electrolyte. The electrolytes used by Edstr√∂m include fixed ceramic and salt-based electrolytes. She is interested in battery technologies for the automotive industry. She leads the √Öngstr√∂m Advanced Battery Centre at Uppsala University, which is the largest group in all of the Nordic countries. She is leading a European Commission project, the EU Large-Scale Research Initiative BATTERY 2030+, that is developing next generation energy storage materials. = Academic service = Edstr√∂m was promoted to Professor at Uppsala University in 2005. She has served as Vice Dean for Research at the Faculty of Science and Technology, and Vice Chancellor of the Degree Program.

The poll was the second to be held under the terms of the Noum√©a Accord, following a similar referendum in 2018. Independence was rejected, with 53.26 percent of voters opposing such a change, a slight drop from the 2018 result in which 56.7 percent voted \\"no\\". Turnout was 85.69 percent. The Noum√©a Accord permits one further referendum to be held, should the Congress of New Caledonia vote for it. The third referendum must be held by 2022. Background New Caledonia was formally annexed by France in 1853, and Europeans and Polynesians, as well as other settlers, have since made the indigenous Kanaks a minority (27%, 11% and 39% respectively in the 2014 census). The territory was used as a penal colony from 1864 to 1897, and the Kanaks were excluded from the French economy and from mining work, and ultimately confined to reservations. Between 1976 and 1988, conflicts between the French government and the independence movement saw periods of serious violence and disorder (culminating in the Ouv√©a cave hostage taking in 1988), with the emerging Kanak independence movement gaining support from many Kanaks frustrated with their lower socio-economic status and lack of involvement in the economy, seen as problems caused by the French exploitation. Though GDP per capita (nominal) is high at $38,921 and though New Caledonia is a major producer of nickel, there is significant inequality in income distribution, with many claiming that the mining revenue benefits people outside the territory and its (declining) mining communities. Since 1986, the United Nations Committee on Decolonization has included New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non- Self-Governing Territories. The 1987 New Caledonia independence referendum, the first referendum on independence, was held the following year on 13 September 1987, but independence was rejected by a large majority, with 842 people (1.7%) voting for independence and 48,611 people (98.3%) voting to remain a part of France. Many pro-independence groups, such as the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), boycotted the vote. The Matignon Agreements, signed on 26 June 1988 by Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Jacques Lafleur, set up a ten-year period of stability and made certain provisions for the Kanak population. The Noum√©a Accord, signed 5 May 1998 by the French government and the main independence and anti-independence parties, set in motion a 20-year transition period that transferred certain powers to the local government and laid the groundwork for an independence referendum in 2018. In accordance with the Noum√©a Accord, New Caledonians are allowed up to three referendums on independence; the first in 2018, then two more in 2020 and 2022 if the previous ones had not resulted in independence, but one-third of members of the Congress of New Caledonia voted for another one.New Caledonia referendum: call to reject 'colonising power' France The Guardian, 17 July 2018 The first was held in November 2018, with voters rejecting independence by 56.7 percent. In 2019, members of the Caledonian Union, Future with Confidence, the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) and the National Union for Independence requested another referendum be held.Le Deuxi√®me r√©f√©rendum √âlections NC Franchise The referendum was held using a special electoral roll. Potential voters had to be registered on the general electoral roll, and also meet one of the secondary criteria:La liste √©lectorale sp√©ciale consultation √âlections NC #Was on the electoral roll for the 1998 referendum on the Noum√©a Accord; #Qualified to be on the electoral roll for the 1998 referendum, but were not enrolled; #Failed to meet the requirements to be on the 1998 electoral roll solely due to absence related to family, medical or professional reasons; #Having civil customary status, or born in New Caledonia and have their material interests in the territory; #At least one parent born in New Caledonia and have their material interests in the territory; #At least 20 years of continuous residence in New Caledonia by 31 December 2014; #Born before 1 January 1989 and have had their residence in New Caledonia between 1988 and 1998 #Born after 31 December 1988 and reached voting age before the referendum, with at least one parent who was on the electoral roll (or qualified to do so) for the 1998 referendum. As a consequence of these restrictions, in the 2018 referendum 35,948 registered voters on the general list were thus excluded from the vote, equating to 17.11% out of a total of 210,105 registered voters on the general electoral roll. Vote restriction restricts the voting power of recent inhabitants‚Äîderogatively known as Zoreilles‚Äîand enlarges the voting power of native Kanaks, and was long sought after by FLNKS. Campaign and voting Campaigns were run by the Front de lib√©ration nationale kanak et socialiste (FLNKS) and the Mouvement nationaliste pour la souverainet√© de Kanaky (Nationalist Movement for the Sovereignty of Kanaky), representing parties who supported independence, and the loyalistes who wanted the territory to remain French. Les Loyalistes included the political parties L'Avenir en confiance and the National Rally, while the secessionists were led by the Labour Party. Campaign issues included rights to the exploitation of nickel in New Caledonia, The French government and loyalists regarded the nickel as one of its strategic assets, as well as an important source of income and employment for the islanders, while separatists were sceptical the benefits to them with foreign companies operating the plants, as well as criticising pollution from the industry and its effect on the vital local sectors of agriculture and fisheries. After abstaining from participating in the 2018 referendum, in July 2020 the anti-globalisation Labour Party announced it would call for its supporters to vote for independence in the upcoming referendum. The referendum was held on 4 October 2020.Nouvelle-Cal√©donie. Le r√©f√©rendum sur l‚Äôind√©pendance se d√©roulera le 4 octobre (in French) Ouest France, 24 June 2020 Voting on the day was largely held peacefully, although the Loyalists did allege that there was some intimidation and racist targeting of voters in a few localities. Results and aftermath With a turnout of 85.6 percent, 53.26 percent of voters opted for \\"no\\", with the result that the islands remain French. This was a lower figure than the 2018 poll, in which 56.7 percent voted \\"no\\". Results were strongly polarised geographically, with 71 percent of South Province residents rejecting independence, while the smaller other two provinces, North Province and Loyalty Islands Province, voted \\"yes\\" by 76 percent and 82 percent respectively. As this was the second of three permitted independence referenda, there may be a third and final referendum at some point before 2022. Daniel Goa, of the pro-independence party Caledonian Union, expressed a hope that the shift in vote share towards the \\"yes\\" camp would lead to a successful third referendum. Meanwhile Sonia Back√®s, leader of Les Loyalistes, called for dialogue between the two sides although she acknowledged that it might be necessary to hold the third referendum before such a dialogue could commence. French president Emmanuel Macron expressed gratitude for the result, thanking New Caledonians for their \\"vote of confidence\\" in the Republic. He also acknowledged those who had backed independence, calling for dialogue between all sides to map out the future of the region.

After the war, he found work at the Campbell Tile Factory in Stoke on Trent, and joined the National Society of Pottery Workers (NSPW). Sillitoe was a supporter of the Labour Party, and won election to Stoke-on-Trent City Council, ultimately serving for 36 years. He became a leading proponent for safer and cleaner working conditions in the pottery industry, and in 1966 he won election as assistant general secretary of the NSPW. At the end of 1974, Alf Dulson retired as general secretary of the union, by then renamed as the Ceramic and Allied Trades Union, and Sillitoe won the election to replace him. He had immediate success by securing a closed shop agreement with the British Pottery Manufacturers' Federation, agreeing how future wage increases would be calculated, and secured an extra two days holiday for workers in the industry.

One of Keppel-Aleks' most notable published works, ‚ÄúEmissions of greenhouse gasses from a North American megacity‚Äù, examines emissions of greenhouse gasses (specifically CO and CH4) around the Los Angeles metro area, otherwise known as the South Coast air basin (SCB). In their study, Keppel Aleks and her fellow researchers looked at data taken from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using FTS column measurements, examining solar energy and greenhouse gas patterns in the atmosphere. Through their data collection, the group discovered that urban areas contribute more to the global greenhouse gas, specifically CH4 or methane gas, emissions than is currently predicted by previous greenhouse gas calculations (such as those done by the California Air Resource Board (CARB)). The group thus concludes that CH4 emissions of urban centers (such as the Los Angeles metro area) could contribute an unaccounted 7-15% of methane to the world budget.

W. Woolworth Company. Early life Parson was born on September 18, 1872 in Toronto, Ontario. He was a son of Eliza S. (n√©e McGibben) Parson and Henry Edwin Parson, a former oil operator who made a fortune but lost it due to fires and the discovery of oil in Oil City, Pennsylvania. He had two brothers, Charles Parson (of Missoula, Montana) and Stuart Parson (of Bronxville, New York). When he was seven years old, his parents brought him to Brooklyn. After receiving his education at the Boys High School in Brooklyn, where he completed a course in bookkeeping. Career After his graduation from the Boys High School, Parson worked several jobs in Brooklyn, first with the Atlantic Chemical Company, then, at age 19, becoming a partner in a chicory importing business. In the spring of 1892, Parson began working with the F. W. Woolworth Company as a $12 a week bookkeeper, obtaining that position through a 5-cent \\"want ad\\" when the Woolworth executive staff consisted of only four men. In 1905, he became treasurer, and eventually, after the death of Carson Peck in 1916, he became general manager and vice president of the Woolworth Company in 1917. Following the death of Frank W. Woolworth in 1919, Parson (who was always thought of by Woolworth as the son he never had) served as the second president of the company before retiring in 1932 (just before the company's 60-year age limit), responsible for the founding of over 2,000 stores. Personal life In 1893, Parson was married to Maysie Adelaide Gasque (d. 1956). Maysie's brother, Clarence Warren Gasque was the director of Woolworth's in England. Parson walked Clarence's daughter, Maysie Gasque, down the aisle at her July 1930 wedding to Roland Robinson (later 1st Baron Martonmere) at St Margaret's Church, Westminster where Princess Mariza Chavchavadze was a bridesmaid. Maysie and Roland were the parents of Loretta Anne Robinson, who later married Edward S. Rogers Jr., the president and CEO of Rogers Communications Inc. Parson died at New York Hospital in New York City on July 9, 1940. After a service at Fairchild Chapel, he was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. His widow, who was then living at 998 Fifth Avenue, died in May 1956. =Residences= Shadow Lawn, Parson's home in West Long Branch, New Jersey The Parsons owned a house down the street from F.W Woolworth (who was at 990 Park Avenue) at 1071 Fifth Avenue in New York (today the site of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) and a large home at 72 Avenue Foch in Paris, which later was confiscated by the Nazis and became the base of operations for the Gestapo in Paris. At the time of his death, they were residing at 420 Park Avenue. In 1918, Parson bought Shadow Lawn, a colonial, wood-frame structure mansion in West Long Branch, New Jersey (not far from the resort town of Asbury Park), from Joseph B. Greenhut, head of the Siegel-Cooper Company for $800,000 in cash plus a $150,000 mortgage. The mansion, which was originally built in 1903 for John A. McCall (president of the New York Life Insurance Company), contained fifty-two rooms and was the subject of a $1 million dollar renovation by Parson after he acquired it. During the 1916 presidential campaign, Greenhut had loaned Shadow Lawn to President Woodrow Wilson, who used the mansion as his Summer White House. In 1927, the home was destroyed by a fire and, in 1929, Parson built a new mansion which contained 130 rooms and cost a reported $10.5 million to build. The home was designed by Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer in the American Beaux-Arts style and built by Thompson-Starrett Company of New York, who built the Woolworth Building in New York City. The exterior gardens were by Achille Duch√™ne and the interior design was crafted by Julian Abele, one of the first professionally trained African American architects in the United States. Parson and his wife, along with her mother and sister (who worked in the New York office of Woolworth), all lived at Shadow Lawn. In 1939, Parson, who was financially ruined by the Great Depression, lost Shadow Lawn to the town for nonpayment of $132,000 in taxes. The home later served as a military hospital and the site of a private school before Monmouth University acquired it in 1955 for $350,000.

The church contains three aisles, of which the central aisle is dedicated to the Presentation of the Virgin, the south aisle to the Three Hierarchs and the north aisle to Saint Nicholas. In the church are icons by well-known Cretan icon painters of the 19th century, such as Antonios Revelakis, Antonios Vivilakis, E. Triolitakis and Ioannis Stais. Some in the iconostasis have silver covers made by local goldsmiths. Above the iconostasis of the central nave are frescos of SS Peter and Paul by the painter Kokotsis. In the dome above the sanctuary is the fresco of \\"She who is Wider than the Heavens\\" depicting the Virgin Mary and painted by Nikos Giannakakis. An epigram written in Greek on the pediment of the front wall reads \\"Ye who walk here see the church of the Mother of God, built by faithful children of the Church finding refuge like frightened birds in the middle of a storm under the wing of the heavenly protecting veil\\". History Icon in the nave According to historical accounts there was a small church on the spot from the early 11th century. The original small church was demolished by the Venetians, who built a warehouse in its place. When the Turks conquered Crete in 1695 they converted the warehouse into a soap factory, which continued operating until 1850. The building was then donated by the Turkish authorities to the Chania Christian community, who converted it into a church, which was inaugurated by the Bishop of Kydonia in 1861. An icon salvaged from the original church, which had been housed in the Church of the Holy Unmercenaries, was transferred to the new church where it is still preserved in the narthex (or lobby area). The north aisle dedicated to Saint Nicholas replaced the Dominican church of St Nicholas in the Splantzia part of the town which the Turks had converted to a mosque. Following the building of the bishop's house, the church became the cathedral of what was then the capital of Crete. The cathedral was damaged in the Greco-Turkish war of 1897 but restored at the expense of the Tsar of Russia, who also donated the cathedral's bell. By royal decree in October, 1947 the feast of the Presentation of the Virgin (November 21) became the official feast day of Chania. A later decree in 1956 made it a bank holiday.

Background The influx of people settling on the north side of the Columbia River in the 1840s, then under the jurisdiction of the Oregon Territory, caused political conflicts over the lack of basic needs addressed by the territorial government. Several major issues and events were the main causes to this dissatisfaction including that basic needs, such as mail, roads, military protection and law enforcement were increasingly required. The Oregon Territory government would not increase spending to satisfy these needs. Another was complaints against the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company who still held the most valuable agricultural land and their livestock would trespass on settlers lands. Settlements north of the Columbia River were increasingly being cut off as the government services, Oregon City, Oregon and Salem, Oregon, required traveling for several days. On July 4, 1851, complaints were brought by citizens to Olympia which were holding Independence Day celebrations. One settler, Hugh Goldsborough read the Declaration of Independence and a fiery lawyer, John Chapman, gave an inspiration address referred to as the future state of Columbia. Chapman‚Äôs speech instigated an election of delegates to attend a convention at Cowlitz Landing, near present-day Toledo, Lewis County to be held the following month. Cowlitz Convention The first meeting of settlers began on August 29, 1851 at Cowlitz Landing. They met to draft a petition to Congress to create a new territory north of the Columbia River. Seth Catlin, a former Illinois legislator was elected president of the convention. Taking two days, documents were prepared explaining their demands from Congress and why they needed Congress‚Äô support. The document was a 1,500-word ‚ÄúMemorial to Congress‚Äù listing the problems and issues facing those living north of the Columbia River. Territory and county borders were also approved as well as other elements of local governing. These documents were published in The Oregonian and the Oregon Spectator, which eventually made their way to Joseph Lane, Governor of the Oregon Territory. The delegates were far ahead of their time in what they proposed. They recommended universal manhood suffrage beginning at the age of 18, which came about 120 year later. Monticello Convention The second meeting, for which the convention and petition takes its name, took place in the town of Monticello, later destroyed by flooding in 1867 and currently within present-day Longview, Cowlitz County. Still feeling ignored by the Oregon Territory government, 44 delegates met on November 25, 1852 to develop, complete and sign another petition to have Columbia Territory established. Although this Memorial was a shorter than the earlier Cowlitz Memorial, it was better written and quickly adopted. After signing the petition, it was again forwarded on to Joseph Lane, who supported the petition and had it sent on to Congress. Notable Signees: *William Nathaniel Bell *Peter Crawford *Arthur A. Denny *Calvin Henry Hale *Doc Maynard Outcome Bill H.R. 348, ‚Äúto establish the territorial government of Columbia,‚Äù was introduced in the House of Representatives from the Committee on Territories. It was introduced by Charles E. Stuart on January 25, 1853. Debates arose, not about whether the bill would pass, but on the name of the new territory. Richard H. Stanton, a representative from Kentucky, proposed the name Washington after George Washington to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia. The title of the bill was changed to ‚Äúan act to establish the Territorial government of Washington‚Äù in the House and passed on February 10, 1853. It then passed the Senate on March 2, 1853 without any need for discussion. After 21 months of campaigning, the bill was signed by President Millard Fillmore on March 2, 1853. The bill became known as the Organic Act and also served as the basis for law in Washington until it gained statehood in 1889.

Her giving of intelligence to the government of Iran later caused Operation Saffron Rose, a cyberwarfare operation that targeted US military contractors. =HBO cyberattack (2017)= In 2017, following a cyberattack on HBO, a large-scale joint investigation was launched on the grounds that confidential information was being leaked. A conditional statement by a hacker going by alias Skote Vahshat said that if money was not paid, scripts of television episodes, including episodes of Game of Thrones, would be leaked. The hack caused a leak of 1.5 terabytes of data, some of which was shows and episodes that had not been broadcast at the time. HBO has since stated that it would take steps to make sure that they would not be breached again. Behzad Mesri was subsequently indicted for the hack. He has since been alleged to be part of the operation unit that had leaked confidential information. According to Certfa, Charming Kitten had targeted US officials involved with the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal. The Iranian government denied any involvement. =Second Indictment (2019)= Witt was officially charged by a Washington, D.C. based jury on February 19, 2019. Four others including the HBO hacker were also charged. A court order was issued authorizing Microsoft to take ownership of 99 DNS domains that were registered by the group.

Life and work  Peter Donebauer studied at Manchester University and the Royal College of Art, London. He is best known for his video artwork 'Entering', part of his seven-part 'Creation Cycle'. This was the first video piece to be commissioned and nationally broadcast by the BBC on 'Second House'. It was created in real-time at the Royal College of Art television studio and transmitted via a live microwave link to Broadcasting House where it was recorded for later broadcast. In 1975-76, Donebauer partnered with Richard Monkhouse to develop the Videokalos colour synthesizer. It decoded the video signal into its red, green and blue components allowing for complex mixing and interlayering of colours and images. The device allowed ‚Äúvideo‚Äù to be ‚Äúplayed live‚Äù like a musical instrument. Utilising the Videokalos synthesiser, Donebauer founded the Video And Music Performers (VAMP) delivering live interactive performances created between video and music performers. VAMP toured the UK in 1978-79 and had a retrospective performance at Tate Britain in 2006. Donebauer created other commissioned works within The Creation Cycle, including 'Struggling', a part of his Arts Council award produced in 1974, and three works commissioned by the British Film Institute: 'Circling' and 'Teeming' in 1975, and 'Dawn Creation' in 1976. In 1980 he produced 'Moving' for the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and in 1980-81 'The Water Cycle' for Thorn-EMI. Later works include the 'Mandala' Cycle, 1991, and 'Thames Reflections', 2003. In 1981 he partnered with David Graham to found Diverse Production, producing political programming for the newly formed Channel 4.

It is in fact the largest French national forest. Thirty-five communes take part in it. The forest is surrounded by the natural regions of Beauce, G√¢tinais, and Loire Valley; it extends along the North of Loire river in an arc which is 60 km in length, from Orl√©ans to Gien, and 5 to 20 km in width. =Routes and railroads= The national routes 60 and 152 cross the forest of Orl√©ans. It is bordered to the West by the national route 20 and the highway A10, to the East by national route 7 and Highway A77, and to the North by Highway A19. Two railroads cross the forest, between Orl√©ans and Neuville-aux- Bois via Rebr√©chien, and between Orl√©ans and Bellegarde via Vennecy and Vitry- aux-Loges. Two GR footpaths cross the forest of Orl√©ans, GR 3 and GR 32. =Communes= These communes are partly or entirely in the forest of Orl√©ans: Saran =Relief and humidity= The forest is more or less flat, the maximum altitude being 177 m and the lowest 107 m, hence an altitude difference of 70 meters across 50 000 hectares. This absence of relief, joined with the impermeability of the soil prevents the natural flow of rainwater and explains the humidity of the terrain and abundance of ponds.  Flora and fauna  The forest is mixed. Among the species, common oak makes up over the half of the trees. The resinous trees are mainly Scots pine, which make up a third. Other than these two species, there are equal amounts of birch, hornbeam, European beech, hazel, Corsican black pine, wild apple trees, and lime trees. Many bird species nest in the forest of Orl√©ans. There can be observed ospreys (returned in 1984), booted eagles, short-toed snake eagles, European honey buzzards, hen harriers, European nightjars, black woodpeckers, middle spotted woodpeckers, grey-headed woodpeckers, woodlarks, and Dartford warblers. Others, such as great egrets and common cranes, sojourn in the forest in course of their migration. Numerous other species of animals can be encountered: red deers, roe deers, hares, pheasants, tree squirrels, wild boars, and common frogs.http://natura2000.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/FR2410018.html (December 2008) =Main species gallery= File:Puhtu_tamm.JPGCommon oak (Over the half of all trees) File:Kiefer43452.JPGScots pine (Over the third of all trees) File:Fall_Perspective_(2980356105).jpgBirch File:Brohmer-Berge- Rothem√ºhl-24-10-2009-30.jpgHornbeam File:Buchenwald_1.jpgEuropean beech File:Corylus_avellana_28082006.jpgHazel File:Crepuscular_rays_in_the_woods_of_Kasterlee,_Belgium.jpgCorsican black pine File:Malus_sylvestris_(villeple)_tre.jpgWild apple tree File:Lasdon_Arboretum_-_Tilia_tomentosa_-_IMG_1525.jpgLime tree File:OspreyNASA.jpgOsprey File:AquilaPennata.jpgBooted eagle File:Circaetus_gallicus_01.JPGShort-toed snake eagle File:Wespenbussard_European_honey_buzzard_Pernis_apivorus.jpgEuropean honey buzzard File:Wow2_filtered.jpgHen harrier File:–î—Ä—ñ–º–ª—é–≥–∞_–Ω–∞_–≥—ñ–ª—Ü—ñ_–¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–∞_(cropped).jpgEuropean nightjar File:Dryocopus_martius,_Perersberg,_Brasov,_Romania_0_(cropped).jpgBlack woodpecker File:Middle-spotted_Woodpecker_- _HungaryCS4E4424_(16224259449)_(cropped).jpgMiddle spotted woodpecker File:Grey-headed_Woodpecker_-_Italy_S4E5692.jpgGrey-headed woodpecker File:Lullula_arborea_(J√°n_Svetl√≠k).jpgWoodlark File:Currucarabilarga.JPGDartford warbler File:Ardea_alba_- San_Francisco_Bay,_California,_USA_-flying-8-1c.jpgGreat egret (Temporary stay in course of migration) File:Common_crane_in_flight_at_Hula_valley.jpgCommon crane (Temporary stay in course of migration) File:Cervus_elaphus_Luc_Viatour_6.jpgRed deer File:Chevreuil(brocard)-HAYE_sylvain.jpgRoe deer File:Feldhase_Schiermonnikoog.JPGHare File:Kalij_pheasant_Prasanna_Mamidala.jpgPheasant File:Ardilla_gris_mexicana.JPGTree squirrel File:Wildsau_im_wilderlebnispark_daun.jpgWild boar File:Dixi- Rana_temporaria.jpgCommon frog  Classification  An area of 28 ha of the forest of Orl√©ans was designated a natural zone of ecological interest, fauna and flora.

Early life  Ellen Smith was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the daughter of Noah Smith and Hannah Draper Wheaton Smith. Hannah Smith died when Ellen was young, and Ellen was raised in Calais, Maine after 1833. Her maternal uncle was diplomat Henry Wheaton.  Career  Tupper taught school in her home in Iowa when her children were young, earning money by adding paying students to her children's lessons. She started keeping bees in Iowa by 1860. Shortly before the American Civil War she started to write short articles on her first experiences in beekeeping, which were published in a local newspaper. In 1871, she and Annie Savery started the Italian Bee Company, based in Des Moines, Iowa, to import and sell Italian honey bees in the American midwest. \\"She attends personally to all shipments of bees, honey, extractors, hives, etc., to all her correspondence and her bees,\\" noted a profile in 1873. She attended the North American Bee-Keepers Convention in Cleveland in 1871, and in Indianapolis in 1872, and was quoted as a national expert on apiary management the following year. Tupper was editor of The Bee- Keepers' Journal from 1873 to 1875, and taught bee-keeping at the State Agricultural College of Iowa. She also wrote for American Bee Journal, Prairie Farmer, The National Bee Journal and Youth's Companion. Tupper lost two hundred hives in a fire in 1873, a major blow to her work. \\"I have worked so hard and am so tired, that I can form no plans for the future,\\" she said at the time. She was selected to coordinate the bee exhibit at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. However, in January 1876 she was arrested on forgery charges. \\"It appears that she freely used the names of relatives and friends, and in addition, forged the names of leading citizens of various cities of Iowa,\\" in signing checks, according to a report at the time. She was found \\"not guilty, the defendant being insane, and not responsible for her acts\\". In time she was released and relocated to Dakota Territory.  Personal life  Ellen Smith married Allen Tupper, a lumberman and aspiring Baptist minister, in 1843. The Tuppers moved to Iowa in 1851.

It was established by missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or Mormons. In May 1855, at the direction of then Church President Brigham Young, thirty-two missionaries were sent to evangelize among Native Americans and establish a mission outpost in the Las Vegas Valley. The mission was abandoned in December 1857 due to growing political issues revolving Mormons and the threat of Native American attacks.  Origin  Between the years 1847 and 1869, over 60,000 Mormon immigrants came and settled in the Salt Lake Valley. With the influx of population came many settlements throughout Utah making Brigham Young more inclined to expand the Church's geographical area outside of the Salt Lake Valley. Young directed many members of the Church to settle in areas surrounding Utah, such as the Cache Valley, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico.The Las Vegas Mormon Fort is still standing today and is open to visitors.Mormons hoped that their expansion would result in both a larger geographical area for the Church as well as providing new missionary opportunities. Missionary opportunities came with an increase of interaction with Native Americans. Some of the initial interactions resulted in Mormons being able to gain influence among different Native American groups and this gained influence opened up greater missionary efforts among Native Americans. Mormons had a unique perspective toward evangelizing among Native Americans. Their belief was that Native Americans came from Israelite descent who at one point migrated to America around 600 BCE, but fell into transgression which caused them to lose favor in the sight of God. Mormons saw Native Americans as people who had gone astray and believed it to be their duty to reintroduce them to the faith they had lost over many centuries. For this reason many Mormon mission outposts were established in the west. The Las Vegas Valley was one of the areas chosen to establish a mission based on its geographical location as a midway point between Cedar City, Utah and San Bernardino, California. The exact site selected was the Las Vegas springs because its small stream created the only oasis for miles. Shortly after settling in May 1855, construction of the Las Vegas Mormon Fort and houses surrounding it began to take place.  Prominent missionaries  The original expedition in 1855 was by 32 missionaries and in April 1856 Brigham Young dispatched additional missionaries. Many of these missionaries had previously served missions and had held positions of prominence in the Church. Jacob Hamblin was called on many missions for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was known in the Church as the \\"Apostle to the Lamanites\\". = William Bringhurst = William Bringhurst was appointed by Brigham Young to be the President of the Las Vegas Mission. Bringhurst traveled to Utah as a member of the John Taylor company in 1847. Upon arriving in the mission in 1855, Bringhurst dedicated himself fully to ensure the mission's success. In 1856, Nathaniel V. Jones was sent by Brigham Young to the mission to claim some of the missionaries to work in mines for the purpose of smelting ore. Bringhurst refused to allow Jones to take his missionaries and upon later return Jones informed Bringhurst that Brigham Young had denounced Bringhurst's status as president of the Las Vegas Mission and his membership in the Church. Bringhurst later regained good-standing with the Church and was appointed by Brigham Young as one of the founding trustees of Brigham Young Academy (now Brigham Young University). = Jacob Hamblin = Jacob Hamblin was called to the Southern Indian Mission in 1853 and was given the title of ‚ÄúApostle to the Lamanites‚Äù by Brigham Young. Hamblin was instrumental in the establishment of many missions for the Church that reached areas in Utah, California, Arizona, and Nevada (including the Las Vegas Mission). Despite the fact that all the missions that Hamblin helped establish would later fall, Hamblin still was a successful missionary among Native Americans. Part of the reason Mormons were able to gain good relations with Native Americans was because of missionaries like Hamblin who was known as a ‚Äúfriend to the Indians‚Äù. Even after the Church halted its efforts of evangelizing to Native Americans after the collapse of their many missions, Hamblin still traveled with the Indian frontier so that he could keep teaching the Natives. = George Washington Bean = George Washington Bean was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1841 at the age of 10. Four years after that, at the age of 14, he was called to serve as a member of the Quorum of the Seventy for the Church, a position usually bestowed upon men much older than Bean. This position involved an increase of responsibility that included Church assignments such as evangelizing. His calling as a Seventy alongside his ability to speak different Native American dialects led to him being one of the 32 missionaries called to settle the Las Vegas Mission in 1855. Bean served many different functions on the mission including being the mission's clerk and serving as a teacher of the Native American languages. However, like many of the other original missionaries, Bean became discomforted by the introduction of ore minors sent by Brigham Young. In September 1856, at the direction of William Bringhurst, Bean and a group of missionaries returned to Salt Lake City to counsel with President Young. There trip proved to be in vain as no changes were made and the mission would abandoned shortly afterwards. After returning to Provo, Utah after leaving the mission, Bean would hold many positions in the community and Church. Bean would serve as a legislator and judge in the community as well as a patriarch and member of an LDS stake presidency.  Life on the mission  Colonists, sent by Brigham Young and led by William Bringhurst, arrived at the Las Vegas Mission site in June 1855 . The missionaries held the following primary objectives: # Developing the site's agricultural potential # Working with and teaching the Native Americans about Jesus Christ # Serving as a station linking Mormon settlements between southern Utah and southern California # Protecting and keeping open the trails which allowed year-round travel and trade left With its initial primary objective to develop agriculture and harvest before winter, immediate excavation began to build an irrigation ditch that diverted water from the Las Vegas Creek to the southeast corner of the fort. Further irrigation ditches were dug to provide water to five-acre farm plots (2.5 acres per person). Most of the days were then spent working the fields. Once the crops were growing well in mid-July, the attention was shifted to the public works of the settlement and different projects were started. Bringhurst and a small company of men searched the mountains for timber for building improvements and adobe brick was made and used to build a corral and to build the fort walls. Late in 1855 the mission obtained horses from California and cattle and mules from Salt Lake City to aid in their labors. When the year 1856 began, the Las Vegas Mission appeared to be making great strides toward permanency. On January 10, the mission received documents which allowed the establishment of an official post office. In late May, three missionaries received permission to bring their families from Salt Lake City to live in the fort. Missionary John Steele reported in April that the lead deposit found in the Potosi mine was large and easily accessible, and a sample of ore was sent to Brigham Young in Salt Lake City. Soon after more missionaries were sent from Salt Lake City by Brigham Young with the focus of extracting the lead ore.  Abandonment  Struggles with the elements and constant thievery by the Native Americans made it difficult for the mission to last long. The missionaries, however, had more than their own struggles to worry about. Prior to the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley, Mormons faced severe conflicts with local and state governments regarding certain religious practices such as polygamy. After arriving in Salt Lake City, tension continued to rise between the US Government and the Mormons and a federal army was dispatched toward Utah on suspicion of rebellion. As a result, Brigham Young recalled all settlers from Carson Valley, San Bernardino, and Las Vegas in order to better concentrate his people and defenses. Within weeks the settlements were abandoned. Other sources attribute social and political conflicts between those committed to the mission's original and its subsequent objectives to the fort's total abandonment. The mission's original objective was to develop the site's agricultural potential, while later more missionaries were sent by Brigham Young to mine and smelt lead ore discovered in the Potosi mountains. The conflict over where to focus the man-power lead to some missionaries leaving the mission and returning to Salt Lake City. With their return to the Salt Lake Valley, the missionaries left behind the still-standing fort, as well as the Potosi mine and all it contained. The missionaries had extracted sixty tons of lead ore from the mine, leaving piles of silver slag. The extracted lead had been shipped to Salt Lake City to be used as needed.

They have been hypothesized to result from the collapse of very large stars by Leningrad physicist Erast Gliner at the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in 1966. Such GEODEs appear to be black holes when viewed from afar but, different from black holes, these objects contain dark energy instead of a gravitational singularity. Contrary to classical black holes, GEODEs may intrinsically gain mass via the same relativistic effect responsible for the photon redshift. This results in a blueshift, which supplements and amplifies any mass gained through typical accretion processes. If the theorized GEODEs exist, then the expansion effect we attribute to dark energy could instead be an effect that we'd be able to attribute to this hypothetical species of black holes. As of now, they remain speculative with no supporting evidence. The widely accepted, standard model of cosmology, postulates that dark energy is an inherent and constant property of spacetime, that would result in an eventual cold death of the universe. Examples of GEODEs The following are a few hypothesized objects that are examples of GEODEs: * Cosmologically embedded point-mass ‚Äì proposed by George C. McVittie in 1933, this solution is one of the few known spherically symmetric strong solutions with realistic asymptotic behavior. * Dark-energy star ‚Äì proposed in 1980 by Robert B. Laughlin and George Chapline Jr. that the surface of a dark energy star actually represents a quantum critical transition of a superfluid vacuum. * De-Sitter sphere ‚Äì The simplest example of a GEODE is the De-Sitter sphere, first proposed by E.B. Gliner in 1966, as a non-singular end stage of stellar gravitational collapse. ** Dymnikova's Vacuum non-singular black hole ‚Äì spherically symmetric vacuum stress-energy tensor. ** Gravastar ‚Äì formed in the limit of a radially decreasing sequence of Schwarzschild constant density spheres, such thin-shell GEODEs are stable to rotations and perturbations. * Vacuum bubble ‚Äì This is an example of a GEODE that is not formed from a gravitational collapse, and describes an isolated region of energized vacuum. Stability Dark energy objects are counter-intuitive and are not suspected to exist by mainstream scientists. Some researchers have proposed models of stable configurations of dark energy stars. However, more research needs to be done to understand the nature and general properties of such compact objects. Detection Despite theoretical basis for dark energy objects there has been no observational support of a GEODE scenario. A few scientists suggest that the ringdown from the merger of a binary black hole can be analysed to differentiate between a conventional black hole and a GEODE. Implications for black hole size The GEODE blueshift naturally produces the large masses observed in binary black hole mergers. Further, blueshift induces an adiabatic inspiral of Keplerian orbits that allows capture of wider binaries. Additionally, some classes of GEODEs can grow by factors of ‚àº100√ó by redshift This can relieve tension between the observed masses of supermassive black holes in quasars at high redshift and their modeled formation timescales. Implications for dark energy According to researchers, if a small number of the oldest stars (Population III stars) collapsed into GEODEs, rather than black holes, their contribution, on average, would result in the uniform dark energy that is observed today. According to the researchers, \\"What we have shown is that if GEODEs do exist, then they can easily give rise to observed phenomena that presently lack convincing explanations. We anticipate numerous other observational consequences of a GEODE scenario, including many ways to exclude it. We‚Äôve barely begun to scratch the surface.‚Äù GEODEs would repel each other and could be spread throughout the intergalactic medium. 50px Text and images are available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

It does not include many of the additional factors typically included in GPI determinations but focuses specifically on the \\"household economy\\". Per Jeremy Greenwood et al., GHP is overlooked by many people and seen as unimportant.  Household production  Factors that contribute to GHP include healthcare, the environment, government, and community. Measurement The measurement of GHP is dependent on the calculation of unpaid labour and the value of the households assets. There is no official standardized form of measurement and has several ways that it can be measured. The 'housekeeper wage' approach is the most commonly used. This measurement calculates the value of GHP through determining the cost of paying for household work to be completed. The ‚Äòspecialist wage approach' calculates the cost of hiring a specialist service to perform individual tasks in the household. This can include cooking, laundry and gardening. A third method of calculating gross household product calculates the opportunity cost of working from home. This looks at the monetary value the is sacrificed by working at home, and therefore the GHP figure is determined.

The Dolmen of Guadalperal, also known as the treasure of Guadalperal and as the Spanish Stonehenge for its resemblance to the English Stonehenge, is a megalithic monument dating from between 2000 and 3000 BC in Peraleda de la Mata, a town in the region of Campo Ara√±uelo in eastern Extremadura, Spain. The monument is within the Valdeca√±as reservoir in the Tagus River and is only visible when the water level allows it. Description and history The dolmen consists of 150 granite stones, called orthostats, placed in a vertical arrangement to form an ovoid chamber in diameter. They are preceded by an access corridor about long and wide. At the end of the corridor, at the entrance of the chamber, there is a menhir about two meters high that has a snake carved and several cups. These figures may have served as protection for the site. The chamber, of the anta type, a common construction in the west of the Iberian Peninsula, consists of 140 stones and was covered with a mound of earth and gravel. It is surrounded by another circular ring that contained the upper mound. According to the latest research, the menhir carved with an elongated and wavy engraving is believed to be a representation of the Tagus River as it passes through the area. The monument was discovered in 1926, during a research and excavation campaign led by the German archaeologist Hugo Obermaier between 1925 and 1927. It could have been a solar temple, and also been used as a burial enclave. Roman remains found there ‚Äì a coin, ceramic fragments and a grinding stone ‚Äì indicate that at that time it was safely preserved from looting. Eleven axes, ceramics, flint knives and a copper punch were found in a nearby dump. A settlement was also found, dating to the time of construction, which presumably housed the builders. Obermaier discovered houses, charcoal and ash stains, pottery, mills, and stones to sharpen axes. In 1963, construction of the Valdeca√±as reservoir inundated the monument; it is only visible when the water is low. Drought conditions in the last decade have exposed the monument in several summers. Unfortunately, inundation has damaged the monument by eroding the stones and their engravings. Hugo Obermaier's team made reproductions of the engravings, which were published in 1960 by German archaeologists Georg and Vera Leisner. The Raices de Peraleda association is requesting its recovery due to the deterioration observed. The structure was seen fully for the first time in 50 years in July 2019, when a NASA satellite photograph during a drought revealed its 150 stones.

The 32nd Texas Cavalry Regiment, sometimes incorrectly named Andrews's 15th Texas Cavalry Regiment, was a unit of volunteer cavalry mustered into the Confederate States Army in May 1862 and which fought during the American Civil War. The regiment was formed around companies from Richard Phillip Crump's 1st Texas Cavalry Battalion which fought in Indian Territory and at Pea Ridge. Many of the soldiers died of disease in the unhealthy camps near Corinth, Mississippi. The cavalrymen were dismounted in July 1862 and served as infantry for the rest of the war. The regiment fought at Richmond, Ky., Stones River, and Chickamauga in 1862‚Äì1863, in the Meridian and Atlanta campaigns and at Nashville in 1864, and at Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley in 1865. The regiment's 58 surviving members surrendered to Federal forces on 9 May 1865. History =Formation= The 32nd Texas Cavalry was accepted into Confederate service in May 1862 at Corinth. It was formed from companies that formerly belonged to Richard Phillip Crump's 1st Texas Cavalry Battalion. The unit that became Company G of the 32nd Texas Cavalry fought at the Battle of Chustenahlah on 26 December 1861. On 7‚Äì8 March 1862, the 1st Texas Cavalry Battalion fought at the Battle of Pea Ridge as part of James M. McIntosh's cavalry brigade. On the first day, the battalion participated in a cavalry charge that drove off two Federal cavalry regiments and seized three cannons. The deaths of McIntosh and his superior Benjamin McCulloch early in the battle led to a loss of command control. This caused many Confederate units to remain idle for most of the day. In the afternoon, Albert Pike finally took command and led several units to join the other half of the army, but the 1st Texas Battalion and other units marched back to camp and out of the battle. Georgia native Julius A. Andrews first enlisted as a sergeant major in the 1st Louisiana Battalion at age 21. He was soon released and went to Texas where he joined Crump's battalion as Adjutant. When the 32nd Texas Cavalry was formed in May 1862, Andrews was elected colonel. The other elected field officers were Lieutenant Colonel James A. Weaver of Hopkins County and Major William E. Estes of Bowie County. =1862‚Äì1863= During its stay in disease-ridden camps during the Siege of Corinth, the 32nd Texas Cavalry suffered the deaths of more than 150 men from measles, pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and other illnesses. Other soldiers became so debilitated that they were discharged from service. The regiment was assigned to the brigade of Joseph L. Hogg along with the 10th Texas, 11th Texas, and 14th Texas Cavalry Regiments. Hogg soon died and was replaced by T. H. McCray as brigade commander. In July 1862, the regiment was dismounted and served the remainder of the war as an infantry unit. The other regiments of the brigade were also dismounted around this time. McCray's brigade was transferred to Edmund Kirby Smith's forces. In late August, Smith's forces advanced toward Lexington, Kentucky. Opposing them were two brigades under William \\"Bull\\" Nelson. After a day of skirmishing, Patrick Cleburne's division was reinforced by a second Confederate division under Thomas James Churchill, which included McCray's brigade. The Battle of Richmond began when Cleburne encountered Mahlon Dickerson Manson's Union brigade near Mount Zion Church. McCray's brigade arrived and began attacking the Federal right flank. McCray's brigade was deployed with the 10th, 11th, 14th, and 32nd (15th) Texas Cavalry, and the 31st Arkansas Infantry Regiment, going from left to right. Though Charles Cruft's Union brigade soon arrived, the Confederates practically annihilated the Federals, inflicting losses of 206 killed, 844 wounded, and 4,303 captured on a force that counted 6,500 soldiers. The Confederates sustained losses of 78 killed, 372 wounded, and one missing out of 6,850 troops engaged. According to another source, the 32nd Texas lost five killed, including two captains, at least six wounded, and 13 captured. Map shows the positions assumed by the armies before the Battle of Stones River. McCown's division was moved to the Confederate left flank. In the Battle of Stones River on 31 December 1862‚Äì2 January 1863, the brigade was commanded by Mathew Ector. The brigade no longer included the 31st Arkansas. Douglas's Texas Battery was attached to the brigade. McCown's division attacked the Federal right flank at dawn on the first day with the brigades of James Edwards Rains on the left, Ector in the center, and Evander McNair on the right. The assault took the Union troops completely by surprise. Ector's brigade defeated August Willich's Union brigade and captured its commander. Within minutes McCown's victorious Confederates captured eight artillery pieces and 1,000 Federals. By chasing after the routed Union troops, Rains's brigade swung too far to the left. Ector aligned his brigade with Rains's soldiers and the two generals soon found that McNair's brigade was nowhere in sight. With McCown's troops too far to the left, Cleburne's division of the second line soon found itself in the front line. Later in the morning McCown reassembled his brigades and allowed the men to replenish their ammunition. McCown then ordered Rains to shift his brigade to the division's right flank attack to the northeast. As Rains's troops burst out of the woods into the open ground near the Nashville Pike, they ran into a concentration of rallied Federal troops. Rains was killed and his brigade repulsed. McCown was unable to coordinate his brigades and Ector's brigade became the next unit to challenge the Union defenses near the turnpike. Colonel Andrews soon found his own regiment and the 14th Texas Cavalry in an unequal battle with Samuel Beatty's Federal brigade. Andrews convinced Ector to withdraw and the two regiments pulled back into the woods. While the 14th and 32nd were pursued into the trees, other Federal troops compelled the 10th and 11th Texas Cavalry to pull back. Ector's brigade reported losing 28 killed, 276 wounded, and 48 missing at Stones River. The 32nd Texas Cavalry lost five killed, 36 wounded, and three missing. In summer 1863, Ector's brigade transferred to Mississippi in a futile attempt to relieve the Siege of Vicksburg. After Stones River, the 11th Texas Cavalry was remounted and transferred to another brigade. For the Battle of Chickamauga on 19‚Äì20 September 1863, Ector's brigade served in States Rights Gist's division in William H. T. Walker's corps. Ector's brigade was made up of Stone's Alabama and Pound's Mississippi Sharpshooter Battalions, the 29th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, the 9th Texas Infantry Regiment, and the 10th, 14th, and 32nd Texas Cavalry. Early on 19 September, John T. Croxton's Federal infantry brigade came into contact with Henry Brevard Davidson's Confederate cavalry brigade. Nathan Bedford Forrest was at hand and he rapidly sent infantry brigades under Claudius C. Wilson and Ector into the expanding conflict. Along the Reed's Bridge Road, Ector's troops came up against Ferdinand Van Derveer's Union brigade. Ector withdrew his troops from the unequal contest after 30 minutes because his troops lacked effective artillery support. Ector and Wilson took such serious losses on the first day that their brigades were reduced to about 500 men each. On 20 September, Gist's division was ordered into action with Peyton H. Colquitt's 980 soldiers in the front line and Ector's and Wilson's men in a supporting line. The attack was repulsed with heavy losses and Colquitt was killed. Ector's and Wilson's troops covered the retreat of Colquitt's survivors. Ector's brigade suffered losses of 59 killed, 239 wounded, and 138 missing. Chickamauga was the worst experience of the war for the 32nd Texas Cavalry. Out of 217 officers and men, the regiment lost 13 killed, 65 wounded, and 40 missing. Andrews was badly wounded in the thigh. =1864‚Äì1865= Samuel Gibbs French After Chickamauga, Ector's brigade transferred to Mississippi where it joined the division of Samuel Gibbs French in Leonidas Polk's corps. The brigade participated in the Meridian campaign in early 1864. For the Atlanta Campaign, Ector's brigade included the 29th and 39th North Carolina Infantry, the 9th Texas Infantry, Jacques's Battalion, and the 10th, 14th, and 32nd Texas Cavalry. On 19 May 1864, French's division joined Joseph E. Johnston's army with 4,174 soldiers. In the Atlanta Campaign, the 32nd Texas Cavalry lost 11 killed and 35 wounded. The brigade fought at Cassville, New Hope Church, Latimer's Farm, Peachtree Creek, Atlanta, and Lovejoy's Station. At the Battle of Allatoona on 5 October 1864, the regiment was assigned to guard the artillery and missed this bloody action. However, Captain Somerville of the regiment led a raid on a Union warehouse in which he was wounded in the stomach and left for dead. Somerville was captured and nursed back to health by the Federal doctors, dying in 1917. Colonel Andrews succeeded to command of the brigade after Allatoona. Ector was wounded during the Atlanta campaign and lost his leg, though he later rejoined the army. During John Bell Hood's invasion of Tennessee, Ector's brigade missed the Battle of Franklin since it was guarding the army's pontoon bridges. Colonel Andrews was badly wounded on 4 December 1864 and left the army to recover. The 32nd Texas Cavalry was commanded by Major Estes during the Battle of Nashville on 15‚Äì16 December. Ector's brigade was part of Alexander P. Stewart's corps and led by Colonel D. Coleman. The regiment lost at least four wounded and 13 captured at Nashville. Ector's brigade, now reduced to only about 500 soldiers, formed part of the army's rearguard during the retreat after Nashville. In January 1865, Estes, Quartermaster John S. Fowlkes, and Surgeon High G. McClarty were furloughed. The Battle of Fort Blakeley was fought on 9 April 1865. Ector's brigade defended Mobile, Alabama in the spring of 1865. Edward Canby commanded 45,000 Union troops while Dabney H. Maury led 10,000 Confederate soldiers and 300 cannons. In the Battle of Spanish Fort two divisions of the Union XIII Corps under Gordon Granger on the left and two divisions of the Union XVI Corps under Andrew Jackson Smith on the right invested the fort. The fort was defended by the brigades of Ector, James T. Holtzclaw, and Randall L. Gibson, from left to right. After Union troops seized a foothold, the fort was evacuated on the night of 8‚Äì9 April 1865 with the loss of about 50 guns and 500 prisoners. The next day, in the Battle of Fort Blakeley, the Federals launched a massive assault and overran the fortifications. The Union troops lost 113 killed and 516 wounded while 3,423 Confederate troops were captured. The 4,500 survivors of Maury's command retreated toward Montgomery, Alabama. The 32nd Texas Cavalry lost seven wounded and 28 captured in the fighting. Nine officers and 49 rank and file of the 32nd Texas Cavalry under the command of Brevet Major Nathan Anderson marched to Meridian where they surrendered on 9 May 1865. Over 1,000 men served with the regiment during the war. Captain Travis C. Henderson of G Company later served in the Texas state legislature. Francis A. Taulman of G Company became mayor of Hubbard, Texas. The Estes brothers helped found the city of Texarkana, Texas. Cullen Montgomery Baker of Company I became a notorious outlaw and killer. Colonel Andrews moved several times and died at 90 years of age in 1930.

Joan Kerouac's autobiography, which existed only in manuscript form when she died, appeared in book form in 2000 after the Kerouacs' only child, Jan Kerouac, her half- brother, David, and David's brother-in-law John Bowers helped prepare it for publication. Joan Kerouac was born near Albany, New York, and grew up there. At age 19, she moved to Manhattan after befriending Bill Cannastra, a lawyer she met in Provincetown, Massachusetts, while visiting an artists' colony. She remained close to Cannastra until his death in a subway accident in 1950. Later in 1950, Joan met Jack Kerouac in Manhattan. He invited her to his mother's home to meet his mother, Gabrielle Kerouac, and two weeks later Joan and Jack were married. Joan became the model for the character Laura in Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road. The marriage, during which Joan became pregnant with Jan, lasted only eight months, and the couple separated before Jan was born. Jack for many years denied paternity. He went to court to avoid paying child support and did not meet his daughter until she was 10. After separating from Jack, Joan lived at times in other parts of the U.S., including San Francisco, the state of Washington, and Eugene, Oregon. She remarried and eventually had three more children: David and twins Sharon and Kathy. In 1974, she changed her last name to Stuart. Joan Haverty Kerouac Stuart died on May 15, 1990, in Eugene.

The Black Cloth (French title Le Pagne Noir: Contes Africains) is a collection of African folk tales by Bernard Binlin Dadi√©. It was first published in 1955, in French; an English translation by Karen C. Hatch was published in 1987. The stories were published at a time when many African writers (including Dadi√© and such authors as Birago Diop) were creating a new outlet for traditional African art, converting oral literature into written literature, and adapting writing to convey the tradition of orality. Background The 1940s and 1950s saw a great wave of African prose literature, a time that gave rise to \\"the African novel\\". At the same time, writers sought to express the more traditional oral prose in print, and to somehow make up for the loss of \\"an atmosphere warmed with music, handclapping, laughter, dancing, and singing\\". Prose authors sought ways of \\"embellishing and enriching\\" their narratives. Senegalese author Birago Diop, who published Tales of Amadou Koumba in 1947, was one of the forerunners in this genre. Diop, however, rendered tales by one particular griot; Dadi√© chose to dispense with some aspects of tradition‚Äîhe did away with some of the traditional structural devices (such as the lengthy introductory and closing formulas), and some of his stories were original creations.Moore 174-75. Authors who followed Diop and Dadi√© in that tradition include Hama Tuma.Smith. Contents Of the sixteen tales in the collection, three are by Dadi√© himself: \\"The Mirror of Dearth\\", \\"The Black Cloth\\", and \\"The Man Who Wanted to be King\\". Ten of the stories involve Anansi the spider,Mphahlele xi‚Äìxii. the West-African trickster character; these are \\"generally in a light vein\\".Irving 481. Two are initiation tales involving orphans who are driven to perform seemingly impossible tasks by their stepmothers. Both orphans are courageous and take up their task willingly, and their stories have happy endings; both \\"initiation routes start from a known place to an unknown destination from where they return to the known place\\".Ra√Ømi 97. The stories Dadi√© reworked from oral tradition were originally in Anyin, Nzema, \\"and other vernacular idioms\\", according to Robert Farris Thompson (who does not, however, note that Dadi√© invented three of the stories).Thompson. =Table of tales= #The Mirror of Dearth #The Black Cloth #The Pitcher #Spider's Hump #L'Enfant Terrible #Spider's Ox #Spider and the Tortoise #Mother Iguana's Funeral #The Pig's Snout #The Hunter and the Boa #The Sacred Cow #The Bat's Relations #The Yam Field #The Dowry Three of the stories were included in the second edition of the Norton Anthology of World Literature: \\"The Mirror of Dearth\\", \\"The Black Cloth\\", and \\"The Hunter and the Boa. They were excised from the third edition.Doherty 108. Selections were included in Nommo: African Fiction in French South of the Sahara by John D. Erickson.Waters 460. =Allegory and New World connections= The title story features a young orphan girl named A√èwa, whose mother has died and whose stepmother sends her on an impossible mission: to wash a black cloth until it is white. The girl, always singing and smiling, succeeds, after she sings to her mother and thereby invokes her. Her mother gives her a white cloth (later recognized as one of the pieces of fabric she was buried in), and A√èwa returns. Thompson comments: \\"A sacred fabric, symbolic of the spiritual purity and power of the otherworldly, restores a child to her social status, links her once more with her mother and, through her mother's marriage and funeral rites, with her father. For me this story reads like a redemptive allegory of blacks going back across the waters of the diaspora in search of the family ties and history severed by the slave trade\\".Thompson. Thompson also points to the many connections between The Black Cloth and the Americas, beginning with the trickster character Kacou Ananze, as Dadi√© calls Anansi, who also occurs in literature of the Caribbean and, in the American Deep South, is found as Aunt Nancy, and \\"teach[es] people to overcome adversity by wit‚Äîwhich can be a very precious gift indeed\\". The silk-cotton tree occurs frequently in the stories, and is also found in African-Cuban folk tales; finally, there are many similarities in the dishes described by Dadi√© and the Creole cuisine of New Orleans and other places around the Gulf of Mexico.Thompson. Style and literary critiques According to the translator, Karen Hatch, and a critic, Evelyn Uhrhan Irving, these stories are \\"twice removed from the original oral tales\\", since they were first transmitted from orality to print, and then from French to English. Nonetheless, according to Irving, \\"these are delightful, linguistically vivid tales\\".Irving 481. Hatch found that although the stories \\"owe much in their design to the expressive features and general structural patterns of the oral story-telling tradition\\", she also saw a distinct resemblance to the work of Guy de Maupassant, who, along with Victor Hugo, was much admired by Dadi√©.Hatch xxxiv. Martial Kokroa Frind√©thi√© comments that \\"Francophone African expressive prose is very digressive and repetitive\\", and illustrates this with citations from \\"The Pitcher\\", one of the stories involving an orphan‚Äîin this case, a boy, Koffi, who broke his stepmother's pitcher and is forced to leave home. The ideas of leaving and suffering are repeated in consecutive paragraphs; the paragraphs have recurring coordinate sentences, and the sentences have recurring verb clusters.Frind√©thi√© 46‚Äì48. While Dadi√© did not keep all the structural aspects of the traditional oral tales, he did retain, for instance, some of the songs (in Nzema), and the onomatopoeic sounds used traditionally, \\"such as Tortoise walking: Clouk! clak! or Kakou Ananz√® sharpening his hatchet before the terrified squirrel: Kochio! kochio!Moore 175. Thompson comments on these adaptations too and on the descriptions of natural phenomena (which he deems \\"faithful to tradition\\"), and adds that the collection \\"demonstrates the sophisticated taste for song, epic, pun, riddle, satire and praise poem characteristic of African peoples south of the Sahara\\". Thompson also praises \\"Ms. Hatch's superbly unobtrusive translation\\".Thompson. =N√©gritude= Whether Dadi√© and this collection were part of the N√©gritude movement or not is a matter of some discussion. Irving said \\"he differs from many of other black writers...in that he never joined the Negritude movement\\";Irving 481. Charlotte Bruner, however, called him one of the \\"so-called 'founders' of the Negritude movement\\".Bruner. Clive Walker says \\"Dadi√©, as author of The Black Cloth..., belongs to the 'Negritude' generation\\",Wake 961. and explains: > \\"many French-speaking black writers of the 1950s sought to establish the > value of African culture in the face of France's arrogant assertion in its > colonies of its cultural superiority. In this context, the transposition of > African folktales into modern French was entirely logical. In response to > the French assumption of moral superiority, these tales reflected the wisdom > of an ordered society which saw the intimate connection between morality and > common-sense, while they incorporated the highest level of imagination and a > rigorous sense of style and form. They were also an expression of the > African sense of community (a major Negritude concept), since they closely > involved the audience in the telling\\".Wake 962.

The station was owned by Cattle Country Broadcasting, a business of Charles and Nellie Babbs. In 1983, racist remarks on religious programs broadcast over country- formatted KTTL and connections to the Posse Comitatus movement led to state and national backlash against the station; after relaunching the station as a contemporary hit radio outlet under the KMCS call letters and having its license renewal designated for hearing, Charles Babbs settled the hearing by agreeing not to pursue a renewal of KMCS's license. History In 1975, Charles and Nellie Babbs filed a construction permit for a new radio station in Dodge City and emerged the winners of a comparative hearing two years later after the owners of KEDD radio dropped out of the proceeding. The new, 100,000-watt station went on the air as country-formatted KTTL on December 13, 1977, bringing Dodge City its second commercial FM station and fourth overall. =National attention= Several years after signing on, KTTL attracted national attention. In addition to six hours a week of farm programs (misstates the sign-on date as 1978 instead of 1977) as well as a daily \\"swap shop\\" show and several religious programs, KTTL aired programs from William P. Gale of the \\"National Identity Broadcast\\" and James Wickstrom, founder of the Posse Comitatus organization. Wickstrom boasted that \\"every rabbi in Los Angeles will die in 24 hours\\" if his anti-Semitic demands were not met, while other programs called Catholics \\"pagans\\" and \\"idol worshippers\\" and used the word \\"nigger\\" to describe African Americans, saying they were from \\"bongo bongo land\\". Vietnamese people and Mexicans, as well as politicians, were also targets of Gale and Wickstrom's programs. The Babbses had views that were in line with these programs: in 1983, when interviewed by a news service reporter, Charles claimed that \\"the white man is supposed to protect the other races\\" and called the Federal Reserve System \\"the Jew-controlled money standard\\". The Babbses' rejection of the government-assigned value of money resulted in them refusing to pay their 1981 property taxes to Gray County, where its transmitter tower was located; advertisers fled as they were garnished for the station's actions. In addition, when Nellie Babbs was interviewed by KAKE-TV and claimed that Rosanne Cash had anti-Semitic views, Cash sued for $3 million, saying she was erroneously quoted. The content of these taped programs prompted KGNO, one of KTTL's competitors in Dodge City, to editorialize against the programs of KTTL, calling them \\"crap\\". This resulted in a significant amount of mail to Robert Stephan, the Attorney General of Kansas, and in a letter from Senator Bob Dole to the FCC. Politicians weighed in in the House of Representatives; when Nellie Babbs appeared before a subcommittee hearing on deregulation in August 1983, Ed Markey scolded her. =Competing applications and sale attempt= KTTL's license came up for renewal in 1983; two groups filed petitions to deny, including the National Black Media Coalition and Dodge City Citizens for Better Broadcasting, while there were three informal objections (one of them from Stephan) and a competing application from Community Service Broadcasting, Inc. Local residents also claimed that KTTL had broadcast out-of-date weather reports and failed to offer advertising time. After dropping the Gale and Wickstrom broadcasts early in 1983, the programs returned to KTTL in late September, with one edition calling President Ronald Reagan a \\"Communist\\". That October, inspectors from the Federal Communications Commission's field office in Kansas City visited the station; fearful of potential violence and with rumors swirling that the station's facilities held weapons and barbed wire, the inspectors coordinated with local law enforcement officials, though ultimately there was no opposition. The inspection revealed several technical violations, which Nellie Babbs owed to the fact that her husband‚Äîthe engineer‚Äîhad left the family suddenly the previous month and taken equipment with him. Opponents of the station feared retribution; some refused to file petitions to deny, while six local residents involved in competing applications were injured on a rural highway, their car having been run off the road at night, in what was deemed a suspicious accident. With the station's legal future in limbo, Charles Babbs found a buyer: Van Smith, an attorney from Garden City and former owner of an AM-FM pair in that city, who under an application filed at the end of May 1983 was to buy KTTL for $450,000. By the time of the Smith sale attempt, a local bank‚ÄîFidelity State Bank and Trust, which also was KTTL's lender (Continued)‚Äîwas the lone advertiser on the station, the others having been scared away by the racist remarks or the garnishments. =Relaunch as KMCS and closure= 1984 saw the relaunch of the beleaguered station as contemporary hit radio outlet under the call letters KMCS, \\"The Max\\"; the new call letters went into effect on October 22, 1984. As KMCS, the station was live instead of automated. By this time, Nellie Babbs had moved to Missouri and was no longer involved in the radio station's operations. In April 1985, the FCC unanimously found that, despite the \\"reprehensible\\" 264 hours of Gale and Wickstrom broadcasts aired over KTTL, hate speech was protected and could not be used as a factor in denying the station a license. Despite denying the petitions to deny, the commission voted to send the license into comparative hearing with Community Service's competing application, and the FCC directed commission staff to look into other factors, such as the character qualifications of the station's owners, in the proceeding. Other issues to be considered in the hearing were the station's failure to keep program logs and illegally operating a mobile service common carrier, even after receiving a cease-and-desist order from the state of Kansas. Later in 1985, the Babbs divorced, with Charles receiving full ownership of Cattle Country. Additionally, it was reported that Broadcast Music, Inc. was investigating KMCS over unpaid royalties for songs. In August 1986, Community Service Broadcasting, the competing applicant, proposed a deal by which Charles Babbs would drop his bid to renew KMCS's license in exchange for $10,000 and the FCC would grant the group a new construction permit for a new license to operate 93.9 FM; this application was supported by FCC staff and approved by the Commission's administrative law judge, leading to the end of KMCS and the award of a new construction permit to Community Service. However, the permit did not come to air immediately due to technical problems; after more than 11 years and two sales, the new 93.9 license, KRPH (now KZRD), signed on early in 1998.

The restaurant has been described by The Boston Globe and The New York Times as a city landmark, and has served German foods and beer in its grand hall for years. Closing briefly from June until November 2014, the restaurant was purchased from longtime owner Rudi Scherff by Peter Picknelly of Peter Pan Bus Lines and Andy Yee, of the former Hu Ke Lau restaurant, in an agreement making them general partners, with Scherff remaining \\"the face of Student Prince\\". In 2008, Gourmet listed it among \\"20 Legendary American Restaurants\\", among the company of Galatoire's, Locke-Ober, and the Grand Central Oyster Bar & Restaurant. History =The \\"Old Fort\\"= city seal today The restaurant today stands on the site of John Pynchon's former estate, known as the \\"Old Fort\\", which was the first brick building when it was constructed in 1660, and the only building to survive the Siege of Springfield during King Philip's War. Traditional accounts of Springfield history say that the first city and county records were kept \\"in the chamber over the porch\\", and that Commissioner John Pynchon, and associates Elizur Holyoke, and Deacon Samuel Chapin held their court in the parlor before audiences of townsfolk. Toward midnight on a night in October 1675, every room of the house was filled with Springfield's men, women, and children as tribesmen burned every other dwelling to the ground; until the end of the siege it remained the only safehouse in the settlement. Following the rebuilding of Springfield, the homestead, with walls described as more than one foot thick, remained in the Pynchon family until it was razed in 1831 for a \\"more modern edifice\\". Today both in the main entrance and at the exterior of the restaurant historical plaques mark the site, and it was for this structure that the establishment lends half of its name, \\"The Fort Restaurant\\". =Establishment= Early advertisement for the restaurant in German, as it appeared in a 1942 issue of the Neu England Rundschau (New England Review) On September 24, 1935, Paul Schoeder, a German immigrant from Spremberg active in Springfield's turnverein, opened the Student Prince Cafe & Tap Room at 8 Fort Street in the storefront of a former shoe store. At the time of the restaurant's opening, the namesake operetta, The Student Prince, was remarkably popular in Springfield, with annual performances at the Court Square Theater during ten years prior to the establishment's opening, and leading man Howard Marsh making his radio debut as Prince Karl on WTIC in neighboring Hartford. Schoeder would place a two-column ad in the Springfield Republican on opening day which billed the restaurant as \\"A bit of the charm of the Old World with the modernity of the New...serving German food and delicatessen\\". With the Springfield newspapers' offices in the same block, the restaurant quickly became a regular meeting place for reporters and politicians such as Edward Boland and Larry O'Brien. After several years of good business, on February 18, 1946 Schoeder and his business partner Miss Erna Sievers opened The Fort Dining Room, featuring mahogany woodwork and commissioned stained glass made by German artisans from New Jersey, depicting scenes from the restaurant's operetta namesake The Student Prince, Heidelberg, and Springfield history. The restaurant over the years has amassed a collection of more than 1,000 steins and an array of bottle openers and artwork which adorn every one of its walls. The expanded restaurant proved so successful that during the 1950s it was not uncommon for a large line to form at its door on a Thursday before 5pm, and from 1935 until 1960 the restaurant had to expand its kitchen five times and build a second preparatory kitchen in its basement, larger than its entire seating area. A wurstplatte from The Student Prince, with knackwurst, boar and cranberry, and bratwurst (top to bottom) By the 1960s the restaurant's reputation had spread beyond the region and it would host such celebrities as Bonanza lead Lorne Greene, John F. Kennedy, Liberace, Carol Lawrence, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Robert Goulet, and in later decades Andr√© the Giant. According to former owner Rudi Scherff, a typical pre-match meal for Andr√© when at the venue included \\"two steins of beer, two bottles of fruit wine, and two or three full meals.\\" For decades The Student Prince has hosted annual Bockbierfest, Maifest, Oktoberfest and Christmas caroling festivities, as well as many graduation parties, weddings, labor, and political meetings. Governor Charlie Baker, Congressman Richard Neal, Mayor Domenic Sarno, and nearly every post-WWII mayor of Springfield of both major parties has held some form of fundraiser or celebration at the venue, including past statewide meetings of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO. * Schoeder died in 1948, and following Sievers' death in 1961, she bequeathed her shares of the business to be split between managers Rupprecht Scherff and Grete Silinski. On July 26, 1968, Scherff was presented a \\"Restaurant of the Year\\" Award from the Massachusetts Restaurant Association for his work to implement a new apprentice training program from the US Department of Labor, providing underprivileged trainees with apprenticeship chef's training with pay. This was but one of many examples of Scherff's engagement in city civic life, later that year he would preside as toastmaster of a charitable fundraiser by the Western Massachusetts Cafe Owners Association, celebrating the 35th anniversary of the 21st Amendment of the US Constitution which had ended Prohibition. On November 8, 1984, Springfield Mayor Richard Neal issued a proclamation that that date was \\"Rupprecht Scherff Day\\", honoring the restaurant's owner for having resided in the United States for 50 years, after immigrating from Germany. As a representative in the US Congress, Neal would also officially read an abridged history of the restaurant submitted to the Congressional Record on October 26, 1995.A Tribute to Student Prince and The Fort. Congressional Record. October 26, 1995. Extensions of Remarks. Page E2052 . Cong. Rec. (Bound) - 104th Congress, First Session Silinshi would cash out on her shares in 1971 as a cash sum and pension, but Scherff, who had begun working at the restaurant in 1949, would spend the rest of his life operating the restaurant, until it was given to his children after his death in 1996 at the age of 82. In 2010 the restaurant celebrated its 75th anniversary as part of a joint Germanic-Hispanic Oktoberfest, with New England Farm Workers Council president Heriberto Flores and Mayor Domenic Sarno christening the ceremony, tapping a keg of Spaten. =Closure and re- opening= In the late 1990s and 2000s, the restaurant saw a gradual decline in business mirroring Springfield's own dwindling economy and downtown base. By 2014, Rudi Scherff reported the restaurant had accrued $800,000 in debt, and in June of that year the restaurant closed. Local owner of Peter Pan Bus Lines Peter Picknelly, and restaurateur Andy Yee of Bean Group Restaurants, best known for Chicopee's former Hu Ke Lau restaurant, approached the Scherff family and worked out an agreement that would allow them to keep the property but removed them from day-to-day operations. As part of this agreement the Scherff family would keep the collection of steins, openers, stained glass windows, and other art, renting them to the restaurant partners for $100 a year; including terms for their maintenance and cleaning. The menu was also modernized to an extant, keeping many popular dishes, but removing some traditional fare like hasenpfeffer and schweinshaxe from the regular menu, with the addition of salads and vegetarian options to reflect changing diner tastes. Following $750,000 of renovations, the restaurant reopened on the day before Thanksgiving, November 26, 2014. Accolades Over the decades the restaurant has been featured as a destination in Springfield in several publications including The New York Times, and The Boston Globe. Globe food critic Anthony Spinazzola would make a point of reviewing the restaurant twice in the 1970s, saying \\"one of the things uniquely unfair about reviewing restaurants is that one seldom gets back to a place he really enjoys\\", making an exception for The Student Prince, he would describe it in a 1975 review as \\"a restaurant I consider among the best in the state.\\" Peter B. Wolf, who was chef during Spinazzola's reviews, serving from 1964 to 1980, would praise the restaurant in 2008 as a place he still frequented as a patron, despite having not worked for the venue in any capacity in nearly 30 years. In 2008, Gourmet would list The Student Prince among \\"20 Legendary American Restaurants\\" called \\"Time's Tables\\", in the magazine's last annual \\"Restaurant Issue\\". Food critic Ruth Reichl and the editorial staff spent the previous year reviewing longstanding restaurants that had \\"stood the test of time and still serve great food.\\" In addition to The Student Prince, included among the list were a number of restaurants from around the United States such as New Orleans' Galatoire's, Joe's Stone Crab in Miami Beach, Boston's Locke-Ober, New York's 21 Club, and the Grand Central Oyster Bar & Restaurant. The following year the restaurant placed 21 among Lonely Planet and Singha's reader's choice list for the \\"world's great bars\\", the only bar appearing in the top 25 for that year from the United States. In 2014, the bar was named among 15 featured in an Editor's Choice list on travel and food website Thrillist. In popular culture A fictionalized version of the restaurant is portrayed in the 2007 American novel An Arsonist's Guide to Writers' Homes in New England by Brock Clarke. Some key difference of artistic license include it being described as owned and operated by a Goerman family rather than the Scherffs, and being in an alley off of Court Square, when in reality Fort Street is about 5 blocks from that location.

She was the \\"first unmarried woman sent out by the Foreign Committee of the Protestant Episcopal church's Mission Board\\". During the Crimean War, Baldwin assisted Florence Nightingale in hospitals, and they became friends. Early life and education Belle Grove Painting of Mrs. Cornelius Baldwin (Mary Briscoe), grandmother of Mary Briscoe Baldwin. Mary Briscoe Baldwin was born at Belle Grove, Frederick County, Virginia, May 20, 1811, in a mansion in the Shenandoah Valley. It was the home of her grandfather. Her father was Dr. Cornelius Baldwin (d. 1828), of Winchester, Virginia. Her mother was Nelly Conway Hite (d. 1830), (daughter of Maj. Isaac Hite, of Belle Grove). Nelly was a niece of James Madison, fourth President of the United States. Mary was the second daughter in a family of twelve ‚Äîincluding Eleanor Conway Baldwin, Isaac Hite Baldwin, Ann Maury Baldwin, James Madison Baldwin, and Robert Stuart Baldwin. The family home was at Cedar Grove, which was near Belle Grove. All of the children in the family received their education from private tutors. On almost every subject which she studied, she formed her own opinions. Bishop William Meade, of the Protestant Episcopal Church, was a relative who greatly influenced and helped her in her religious life. Her Christian character was put to a great test by the death of her parents, the breaking up of the family home, and the separation of the children. Career When about twenty years of age, Mary and her sister Eleanor went to visit relatives in Staunton, Virginia. Spending about a year there, she said:‚Äî\\"I grew weary of fashionable life. For some years, I had felt a great desire to be directly engaged in some Christian work, especially in extending the knowledge of the Gospel among my fellow-creatures, such as is the privilege of clergymen to do, but, being a woman, I could not possibly enter the ministry. Next to this, my thoughts turned to the life of a missionary, and this seemed a position far too high and heavenly for me to attain and enjoy.\\" Recognizing that her education was incomplete, she enrolled in Miss Sheffy's boarding school at Staunton. After two terms, she was offered the position of assistant teacher at the institution, which she accepted, but also continued her regular studies at the school. While there, she inquired if there were an opportunity for a single woman to do foreign missionary work. The Protestant Episcopal Society received a letter from Mrs. Hill, of Athens, Greece, stating her pressing need of assistance, and urgently requesting that some one be sent to aid her in the schools she had established. As Baldwin had some acquaintance with Mrs. Hill, she was interested especially in that work, and after a long consideration of the matter she wrote,‚Äî\\"I rose up with a firm and steady purpose of heart and said, 'I will go.'\\" Baldwin was one of the first unmarried missionaries to go out from America. Her decision was a surprise to her friends, some of whom said she was \\"going on a wild-goose chase;\\" or, the old story, that she was \\"throwing herself away;\\" or, for her it was \\"a descent in the social scale.\\" But none of these things moved her. After her decision was made, she at once commenced her preparations ‚Äî visited her old home, and traveled over the country visiting many points of interest. She entered the service not for worldly gain; her salary was only , but she was willing to supplement the deficiency by drawing upon her own financial resources. =Greece= Arriving in Greece, in mid-summer 1835, she realized with great delight that her life was to be passed in a land full of stirring memories. The worship of the poorer and unlearned classes consisted mostly in the adoration of pictures, images, and sacred symbols, or in chanting prayers in the olden tongue. Many years of cruel oppression and taxation had impoverished them, so that the missionary had to minister to their bodily wants as well as to their soul needs, and Miss Baldwin, comprehending the situation, fulfilled her highest conception of duty in ministering to their every need. Dr. and Mrs. Hill, American missionaries who had established a school and found the project developing on their hands, sought the assistance of Baldwin, who took charge of the sewing department. She soon was appreciated by the girls and the esteem of the parents, who valued the art which enabled their girls to maintain themselves. After the acknowledgment of Greek independence, the court was removed to Athens. Milliners and dressmakers followed in the train, and wanted girls who could use their needles; and the only ones who knew anything of the art of sewing were found to be those whom Baldwin had taught. The great benefit thus conferred on impoverished families was such that Baldwin became known among the native population as \\"Good Lady Mary,\\" and when she appeared on the streets, the people were ready to do her homage. This prepared the way for Christian teaching. Her object was to civilize and Christianize the daughters, and through them, the homes of the people; and with 350 children under her care, she had ample opportunity to exert an influence. Not only did she train Greek girls to be good daughters, wives, and mothers, but she educated many of the better class for teachers, who in their turn labored among the Greek and Turkish women, and thus perpetuated her influence. After laboring for eleven years, it became necessary for her to seek relaxation, and, in company with friends, she took a trip through Italy. Not receiving the desired benefit, she made an excursion through Greece, then came to her home in the United States; but after a visit of a year, returned to Greece, taking her sister. They established a boarding school in connection with the day school conducted by Mrs. Hill. This school was for the higher class of girls in Athens, and to this project Baldwin, devoted much of her own private fortune until it was a success, so that practically, she became the founder of Christian female education in the country. During 1866, when the Christians of Crete revolted against the Turkish government, many impoverished and destitute Cretans fled to Athens. Among these refugees, Baldwin labored for two or more years with great success, establishing day schools and Sunday schools, feeding the hungry, providing the women and girls with material for work, and teaching them to sew and knit, and thus giving employment to hundreds. As the Cretans returned to their home, Baldwin felt that, having spent 33 years there, her work in Greece was done, and she requested the Missionary Committee to transfer her to Jaffa ‚Äîthe ancient Joppa‚Äî as her nephew had been appointed consul. =Jaffa= The transfer was approved, and in 1869, she went to live with her sister, Ann Maury Hay, and nephew, John Baldin Hay, to assist in the Protestant schools. She became associated with Miss Arnott, a Scotch woman, who for some time had been teaching a girls' school. Here was a great field among Jews, Greek Christians, and Muslims. She had often spoken of Palestine and was pleased when she commenced laboring in Joppa. On account of failure in sight, she was compelled to sever her relations with Miss Arnott's school, but, after rest and medical treatment, she established a boys' school. Funds being required to put up a building, she returned, after an absence of 25 years, to the United States in 1872, and collected money for the purpose. While visiting one of the churches, she fell, meeting with a serious injury, and from the time of her fall to her death, she was seldom free from pain, day or night. Death and legacy Baldwin returned, however, to carry on, and was supremely happy in her work, the associations of Palestine having a charm for her. She died June 21, 1877, after 42 years of service. She was buried on a bluff overlooking the Jordan Valley, and friends placed over her a tombstone of Greek marble with the inscription:‚Äî\\"There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.\\" After Baldwin's death, the Joppa Mission School was renamed. Mary Baldwin Memorial School.

She was in commission at various times from 1923 to 1934, and was recommissioned in 1940. Before World War II, she served in the waters of Japan. During World War II, she took part in the Battle of Wake Island and the Aleutian Islands campaign, conducting the first attack on an enemy ship ever carried out by a Japanese Ro-type submarine. She was sunk in August 1942. Design and description The submarines of the Type L4 sub-class were copies of the Group 3 subclass of the British L-class class submarine built under license in Japan.Chesneau, Roger, ed., Conway‚Ä≤s All the World‚Ä≤s Fighting Ships 1922‚Äì1946, New York: Mayflower Books, 1980, , p. 203. They were slightly larger and had two more torpedo tubes than the preceding submarines of the L3 subclass. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long and had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of . For surface running, the submarines were powered by two Vickers diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged, each propeller was driven by an electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, they had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The submarines were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, all in the bow, and carried a total of twelve 6th Year Type torpedoes. They were also armed with a single deck gun and a 6.5 mm machine gun. Construction and commissioning Ro-61 was laid down as Submarine No. 72 on 5 June 1922 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan. Launched on 19 May 1923, she was completed and commissioned on 9 February 1924. Service history =Pre-World War II= Upon commissioning, Submarine No. 72 was attached to the Sasebo Naval District and assigned to Submarine Division 26 ‚Äî in which she spent the remainder of her career ‚Äî and to the Sasebo Defense Division. On 1 April 1924, Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet. Submarine No. 72 was renamed Ro-61 on 1 November 1924. On 1 December 1925, Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 2 in the 2nd Fleet in the Combined Fleet. On 1 March 1926, Ro-61 and the submarines , , , , , , and departed Sasebo, Japan, bound for Okinawa, which they reached the same day. The eight submarines got underway from Okinawa on 30 March 1926 for a training cruise in Chinese waters off Shanghai and Amoy which concluded with their arrival at Mako off Formosa on 5 April 1926. They departed Mako on 20 April 1926 for the return leg of their training cruise, operating off China near Chusan Island, then returned to Sasebo on 26 April 1926. In June 1926, Ro-61 took part in underwater habitability tests, during which a dummy torpedo exploded and poisoned 20 sailors; they received treatment aboard the submarine tender . On 15 December 1926, Submarine Division 26 returned to the Sasebo Naval District and the Sasebo Defense Division. On 27 March 1927, Ro-60, Ro-61, Ro-62, Ro-63, and Ro-64 departed Saeki Bay, Japan, for a training cruise off Tsingtao, China, which they concluded with their arrival at Sasebo, Japan, on 16 May 1927. On 10 December 1928, Submarine Division 26 again was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet. Ro-61 was decommissioned on 1 November 1929 and placed in Third Reserve at Sasebo. Ro-61 was recommissioned on 1 December 1930, and that day Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to the Sasebo Naval District. Ro-61 again was decommissioned on 4 November 1931. Recommissioned on 16 July 1934, she served with Submarine Division 26 in the Sasebo Naval District until 15 December 1934, when she again was placed in reserve at Sasebo. and while in Second Reserve was assigned to the Sasebo Guard Squadron from 15 November 1934 to 15 November 1935. She moved to Third Reserve on 15 December 1938 and to Fourth Reserve on 15 November 1939. Ro-61 again was recommissioned on 15 November 1940, and that day Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 4th Fleet in the Combined Fleet. When the Imperial Japanese Navy deployed for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, Ro-61 was at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. She received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. =World War II= Central Pacific Ro-61 was with the other submarines of Submarine Division 26 ‚Äî Ro-60 and ‚Äî at Kwajalein when Japan entered World War II on 8 December 1941, Kwajalein time. The three submarines were placed on \\"standby alert\\" that day as United States Marine Corps forces on Wake Island threw back the first Japanese attempt to invade the atoll. On 12 December 1941, Ro-60 and Ro-61 got underway from Kwajalein to support a second, heavily reinforced Japanese attempt to invade Wake Island. Ro-62 followed on 14 December 1941. The Battle of Wake Island ended as Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December 1941. Ro-61 saw no action off Wake and returned to Kwajalein on 27 December 1941. She and Ro-62 were reassigned to the Marshalls Area Guard Unit on 5 January 1942 and patrolled off Kwajalein thereafter. Carrier aircraft of United States Navy Task Force 8 raided Kwajalein on 1 February 1942. Two hours later, the Japanese 6th Fleet ordered the submarines of Submarine Squadron 1 ‚Äî Ro-61, Ro-62, , , , , , , and ‚Äî to intercept the American task force, but none of the submarines made contact with it. In March 1942, Ro-61 and Ro-62 made their way to Japan, calling at Truk in the Caroline Islands from 9 to 19 March and pausing briefly at Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 22 March before arriving at Sasebo on 30 March 1942. The two submarines departed Sasebo on 31 May 1942, called at Saipan from 6 to 7 June 1942, and arrived at Truk on 10 June 1942. Recalled to Japan, they got underway from Truk on 27 June 1942 bound for Yokosuka, Japan, which they reached on 5 July 1942. Aleutian Islands campaign On 14 July 1942, Submarine Division 26 was reassigned to the 5th Fleet for service in the Aleutian Islands, where the Aleutian Islands campaign had begun in June 1942 with the Japanese occupation of Attu and Kiska. Ro-61 and Ro-62 departed Yokosuka on 24 July 1942 bound for Paramushiro in the northern Kurile Islands, where they arrived on 30 July 1942. They put to sea again on 1 August 1942 to head for Kiska, which they reached on 5 August 1942. Thereafter, they were based there along with the submarines , , , , , and . On 7 August 1942, an American task force bombarded Kiska while I-6, Ro-61, Ro-64, and Ro-68 were anchored in the harbor, and they crash-dived to avoid damage. On 8 August 1942, Ro-61 sortied to intercept the American ships, but failed to find them. She returned to Kiska on 10 August 1942. She again put to sea on 11 August 1942 in anticipation of another American raid, but none materialized, and she returned to Kiska on 13 August. She got underway on 15 August 1942 to patrol off Kiska, returning on 17 August 1942 without seeing action. On 28 August 1942, a Kiska-based Aichi E13A1 (Allied reporting name \\"Jake\\") reconnaissance floatplane sighted the U.S. Navy seaplane tender ‚Äî which the plane‚Ä≤s crew mistakenly identified as a light cruiser ‚Äî and a destroyer in Nazan Bay on the coast of Atka. Ro-61, Ro-62, and Ro-64 got underway from Kiska that day to intercept the ships, and all three of them arrived off Atka on 29 August 1942. Ro-61, at the northern end of the line of submarines, received orders to penetrate Nazan Bay in an attempt to lure the American ships out of the harbor so that the submarines could attack them. Ro-61 entered Nazan Bay after sundown on 30 August 1942 and approached Casco ‚Äî which her commanding officer misidentified as a heavy cruiser ‚Äî so slowly and cautiously that her batteries almost became depleted. She fired three torpedoes from a range of . The first torpedo missed and came to rest on the beach, and the third torpedo also missed. However, the second torpedo struck Casco in her forward engine room, inflicting such severe damage that Casco‚Ä≤s crew beached her to prevent her from sinking. It was the first attack on an enemy ship ever conducted by any Japanese Ro-type submarine. Loss On 31 August 1942, a PBY-5A Catalina flying boat of U.S. Navy Patrol Squadron 42 (VP-42) sighted Ro-61 on the surface in the Bering Sea off the north coast of Atka in the lee of Mount Atka. It attacked Ro-61, strafing her, dropping two depth charges, and inflicting heavy damage. Another PBY, from Patrol Squadron 43 (VP-43), also dropped depth charges. Ro-61 crash-dived, leaving a large oil slick behind on the surface. The VP-43 PBY directed the nearby destroyer to the scene of the attack and marked the oil slick with smoke floats. With Ro-61 operating at a depth of , Reid dropped a pattern of 13 depth charges. Ro-61 dived to and Reid dropped another pattern of 13 depth charges, which shorted out Ro-61‚Ä≤s central switchboard, started fires in her control room and shell magazine, started multiple leaks in both her diesel engine room and her battery room, and caused her to take on a stern trim. To get her back on an even keel, her crew carried bags of rice and canned food to her bow section. Sea water reached her batteries, creating deadly chlorine gas that began to fill Ro-61‚Ä≤s interior, and chlorine gas poisoning killed one petty officer. Ro-61 suddenly took on a forward trim, and her crew carried shells to her aft compartments in an attempt to stabilize her. The damage Reid‚Ä≤s second attack inflicted ultimately forced Ro-61 to surface. Some members of her crew fired at Reid with Arisaka rifles and others attempted to man her deck gun, but Reid swept Ro-61‚Ä≤s deck and conning tower with 20 mm cannon fire that killed or incapacitated most of them. Reid then began scoring hits on Ro-61 with her 5-inch (127 mm)/38 caliber guns. Ro-61 capsized and sank by the stern at with the loss of 60 men. Reid rescued five survivors from the water, and they identified their submarine as Ro-61. On 1 September 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared Ro-61 to be presumed lost in the Aleutian Islands. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 20 October 1942.

Stigler is an American psychologist, researcher, entrepreneur and author. He is Distinguished Professor in the Department of Psychology at University of California, Los Angeles and a Fellow of the Precision Institute at National University, San Diego. Stigler's research is focused on understanding processes of teaching and learning, especially of mathematics and science. He has also conducted research on reshaping the role of research and development in education. He is the co-author of two books, The Teaching Gap and The Learning Gap. Stigler has received several awards for his research, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and the QuEST award from the American Federation of Teachers. He is a fellow with the American Psychological Society and the American Educational Research Association, and a member of the National Academy of Education.  Education  Stigler received an A.B. in Religious Studies from Brown University in 1976 and an M.S. in Education from University of Pennsylvania in 1977. Later, he received an M.A. in Developmental Psychology in 1979 and a Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology in 1982, both from University of Michigan.  Career  Stigler joined the University of Chicago in 1983 as an Assistant Professor, becoming Associate Professor in 1989. In 1991, he left the University of Chicago and taught briefly at Dartmouth College before joining University of California, Los Angeles where he has remained since. He was appointed as Associate Dean for Research and Innovation in the UCLA Division of Social Sciences in 2011 and served in this position until 2016. From 2008 to 2017, he was a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. In 2017, the Precision Institute at National University, San Diego appointed him as a Fellow. At the Precision Institute, he has worked to develop and share research aligned with the Institute‚Äôs mission of expanding data-driven approaches to identifying and applying effective personalized learning methodologies in higher education. From 1997 to 2001, Stigler served on the Board of Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences at National Academy of Sciences. = Entrepreneurship = Throughout his career, Stigler has been involved in founding companies that tie into his research. In 1995, Stigler founded Digital Lava, a multimedia technology company and took the company to IPO in 1999. He founded LessonLab, Inc. in 1998 and served as its CEO until 2003, when it was acquired by Pearson. Thereafter, he was appointed as the Senior Vice President of Research at Pearson Achievement Solutions and worked in this position until 2007. In 2013, he co-founded (with his son Charlie Stigler) Zaption, an education technology company in the video learning space. Zaption was acquired by Workday in 2016.  Research  = Understanding and improving teaching and learning = In the beginning of his career, Stigler's research was focused primarily on cross-cultural comparison of teaching and learning, producing a number of studies and articles, and two trade books: The Learning Gap (co-authored with Harold W. Stevenson) and The Teaching Gap (co- authored with James Hiebert). The latter book reported on the first of two large video surveys he directed in the 1990s, the TIMSS Video Studies, and compared eighth-grade mathematics teaching in Germany, Japan, and the United States. Most of his work has focused on mathematics teaching and learning. Through this work Stigler became well known for his work in the analysis of classroom video, both cross-culturally and within cultures as a means of explaining within-culture variation in teachers‚Äô Value Added Assessment (VAE) scores. He collaborated with a group of Scandinavian researchers on a study comparing algebra teaching in Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the US. In later research, Stigler extended this work in various ways. In research with Nicole Kersting at the University of Arizona, Stigler focused on teacher knowledge and how it impacts instructional quality and student learning. A key innovation in this work was the development of the Classroom Video Analysis (CVA) assessment of teacher knowledge. In the late 2000s Stigler started researching what community college students remember and understand about basic middle- and high-school mathematics, producing several papers (with Karen Givvin) that documented the fragile and fragmented nature of what remains of students‚Äô K12 mathematics education. In the late 2010s Stigler started a collaboration with Ji Son at California State University, Los Angeles. They worked on a theory-based course redesign of introductory statistics as a means of developing and testing what they called the practicing connections hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, extensive and deliberate practice applying core concepts and representations of a domain to increasingly complex problems throughout a course will result in knowledge that is more coherent, flexible and transferable. They published the first version of an interactive online textbook based on the approach in 2017, and the first paper to come from this collaboration in 2018. = Education R&D; and improvement science = Some of Stigler's research has been focused on re- thinking how R&D; for education is carried out. Part of this effort has been conducted in collaboration with the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, where he served as a Senior Fellow from 2008 to 2017 and contributed to the development of Carnegie‚Äôs Statway program for community colleges. In August 2017, Stigler and his team at UCLA, with funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, has been developing what he calls the Better Book approach to education research and development, as well as a technology platform (CourseKata) designed to support the approach. Instead of researchers, curriculum developers, and instructors working in silos, the Better Book approach involves an ongoing collaboration focused on incremental and continuous improvements to an online interactive textbook based on student-generated data. The first focus of the Better Book approach is the introductory statistics book co-authored with Ji Son.  Awards and honors  *1985 - William G.

In February 2019, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority launched a competition for a new hymn for Bangsamoro, along with design competitions for a new flag and seal of the region. A proposed legislation to adopt an official regional hymn for Bangsamoro filed before the Bangsamoro Parliament is Parliament Bill No. 2 which is also known as \\"An Act Adopting the Official Hymn of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM)\\". By August 29, 2019, the measure is already on its second reading. Three versions of the hymn in English, Filipino and Maguindanaon languages has been proposed as per parliament member Romeo Sema, a proponent of the measure. Sema's colleague's has suggested changes to the bill such as adding a designated portion of the hymn sang by a female for gender-inclusiveness and render additional versions of the hymn in every regional language of Bangsamoro. The Bangsamoro Parliament approved the proposed version of the Bangsamoro Hymn under Cabinet Bill no. 39 on January 30, 2020. The proposed legislation is signed into law on February 13, 2020 by Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim as Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 7.

The company has over 30 million monthly active users playing its game titles. History The company was founded in 2010 by Robert Antokol and Uri Shahak. In May 2011, the company was bought by Caesars Entertainment Corporation. Antokol remained the CEO of Playtika, and the company remained an independent unit within Caesars. In July 2016, the company's operations were acquired by a Chinese consortium, valued at 4.4 billion dollars. Partnership and initiatives Headquartered in Herzliya, Israel, the company has over three thousand employees in offices worldwide including Tel-Aviv, London, Berlin, Vienna, Helsinki, Montreal, Chicago, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Santa Monica, Sydney, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Kyiv, Bucharest, Minsk, Dnepr, and Vinnytsia. Playtika started off in the casino-style genre of \\"Social Casino Games\\". This genre uses the central elements of popular casino games but players cannot use real cash within the gameplay, nor can they win real money. In lieu of a possible cashout, players play Social Casino games solely for their entertainment value and so to maintain their engagement, Playtika focused on creating rich layers of constantly evolving content on top of the core game mechanic. At January 2018, Playtika set up a $400 million Israel investment fund. The fund plans to invest in Israeli mobile and Internet digital entertainment and consumer product companies. In October 2017, Playtika made its first foray into the casual games' genre with its acquisition of the Israeli-based games studio, Jelly Button. In December 2018, the company took another step in its new diversification strategy with the acquisition of Berlin-based casual games studio, Wooga. In January 2019, the company acquired a Vienna-based casual games studio, Super treat. In May 2019, the company launched an independent division dedicated to the creation and rapid development of casual games which plans to launch several new games every year. The announcement introducing the new independent division was made at the company's Global Summit in Ibiza, where over 2,500 employees from Playtika's 16 locations around the world gathered for a company event.

He was colloquially know in town as 'John, the Frenchman'.  Early life  Born Aimable Ciril Duperouzel in St Aubin du Perronn, Coutances, Manche Lower Normandy, France on 17 March 1831. He was the youngest son of Charles and Rad√©gondle Duperouzel (Du p√©rouzel). Aimable was raised on the family farm.  Life on the Channel Islands  Duperouzel emigrated to the Channel Island of Jersey prior to 1848. He faced court accused of inducing a 10-year-old son of Elias Billot to rob his father on 5 September 1848 but the charge could not be substantiated and was later dropped. Duperouzel married his first wife Elizabeth [Betsey] Susanne Ferey 18 months later in March 1850 at St Helier. Both newlyweds lied about their age. At the time of their marriage Amiable was 18 whilst Elizabeth would have been 24, having been born in the Parish of Trinity on 19 June 1826. This was done to avoid requiring written permission of Duperouzel's parents as was the law at the time. On 15 August 1851 Elizabeth gave birth to a son John Aimable Duperouzel. A few months later in November 1851 Duperouzel plead guilty to theft of several fowls, the offence occurred on 30 October. After entering his plea Aimable requested permission to depart Jersey to \\"avoid further prosecution\\" which was granted. Duperouzel and his family departed Jersey for the nearby Channel Island of Guernsey. The couple's son, John Aimable, was baptized in February 1852 at St. Peter Port. He died not long after on 25 October 1854 at three years of age. A few years later Aimable was brought before the courts on a string of offences. The most serious of which were robbery charges for the repeated theft from a drapery shop between April 1855 and August 1856. While awaiting trial Duperouzel made \\"two ineffectual\\" escape attempts; as a result, he was sentenced to ten years transportation on 6 September 1856.  Imprisonment  Duperouzel spent about sixteen months in prison in England before being transported to the Western Australia aboard the Lord Raglan. Aimable boarded the ship on 22 February 1858 at Portsmouth. > He was given the number 4840 and was described on arrival as being five feet > seven and a quarter inches tall, of stout appearance, dark, with black hair, > hazel eyes and a cut on the right side of his chin. He was protestant and > able to read and write. The Lord Raglan departed Plymouth on 6 March 1858 with 270 male convicts on board.  Western Australia  Duperouzel arrived in Fremantle on 1 June 1858 aboard the Lord Raglan. Within his first year in the colony he received his ticket of leave in May 1859. He was 'grubbing' for a farmer in York at the time. Two years later, on 15 June 1861, Aimable received a conditional pardon. At the time he had served about half of his ten-year sentence. Whilst working as a labourer and stable hand for S. S. Parker of York Duperouzel met Julie Neagle (14 November 1844 - 8 January 1926), an Irish migrant working as a housemaid on the farm. Though he had been married whilst living in Jersey, Aimable and Julie were married on 26 March 1863. Whether he had heard of her passing, or simply chose not to seek out his first wife is not known and no record exists of Elizabeth Ferey after Aimable's transportation. In 1871 Duperouzel made an application for a tillage lease of 100 acres at Qualen, southwest of York. It was rare for an expiree to save enough to purchase land. So much so that it merited mention in Janet Millet's book, An Australian Parsonage: > A benevolent person whom we know proposed the establishment of a savings‚Äô > bank for the shepherds, and endeavoured to induce an old colonist to assist > him in the scheme, but only met the answer, ‚ÄòTeach ‚Äòem to save their money? > that‚Äôs not what we want; if they once begin they will be our servants no > longer!‚Äô And the stupid old man, who had himself begun life as a day > labourer in England, could not be brought to see that to improve the > conditions of individuals would help to enrich the community at large. Good > servants, however, who were bent on saving, could continue to put by money > in spite of all disadvantages; and a French convict, who afterwards brought > land and did very well, once brought to my husband as much as thirty-eight > pounds of his earnings, with the request that he would take care of the sum > for him. I was glad when the Frenchman carried away his bank notes a few > weeks afterwards, for in Western Australia no one feels safe with money in > the house or on the person, so that cheques are given for sums as low as > half a sovereign. Duperouzel named his farm Black Wattle Flats, purportedly for the \\"Stands of black wattle\\" which dominated the block previously. Aimable increased his land holdings considerably whilst he occupied the farm at Qualen. One request for a pastoral lease caused conflict with former employer and politician S. S. Parker, who petitioned the commissioner of crown lands to deny Duperouzel application. By September 1884 other settlers had taken up lands between Black Wattle Flats and York. Eventually the old unsurveyed tracks which Duperouzel had used to reach town became enveloped by fenced farmland. It took two years to petition for the surveying of a new road, possibly because Duperouzel's proposed road placement passed through lands owned by prominent families who opposed him. Ultimately, Aimable was successful. He received a written apology from the York Road Board and a new road was surveyed in August 1886.  Supreme Court Battle  Duperouzel's contact with the legal system did not end with his pardon. Over the decades he lived in York he was involved in numerous complaints to the police. This culminated in a 1898 Supreme Court case where Duperouzel accused publican and operator of the Castle Hotel, James T. Craig of Slander. The case was the result of a dispute which occurred in York opposite the Castle Hotel. The West Australian reported that Craig: > In the presence of a number of witnesses, stated that the plaintiff was a > convict and had been sent out to this country for thieving that instead of > being called a retired farmer and horse dealer, he ought to be called a > retired horse stealer, that he had set fire to and burned other people's > land, and that he had mares which had four foals a year. Craig entered a counter-claim against Duperouzel for comments which implicated him as a murderer and poisoner of his patrons. Chief Justice Alexander Onslow found in favour of the plaintiff, Duperouzel. In delivering his judgement Onslow expressed disappointment at \\"see[ing] the charge of being a convict hurled against a man who had lived for 40 years as a well-conducted person.\\" Craig's counter claim was dismissed and Duperouzel was awarded ¬£250 in damages, equivalent of almost $40,000 today.  Death and Legacy  In the early 1890s Duperouzel built a cottage in York using stone from the farm at Qualen, the residence has since become heritage listed. Aimable died on 10 December 1901. Duperouzel and his wife had seven children. Their second child John Aimable Duperouzel was given the same name as Duperouzel's only child from his first marriage. Similarly to his older half brother and namesake, John Aimable died young. Duperouzel was survived by his six other children and his wife. Rica Erickson describes Duperouzel as a prominent and colourful member of the York community. He was known by most as 'John the Frenchman', his French name was difficult for York locals and was etched incorrectly on his tombstone as \\"Amiable Sierl Duperouzel\\".

His academic research has focused on diffusion of innovations, the positive deviance approach, organizing for social change, the entertainment-education strategy, and liberating interactional structures. He currently holds the positions of Samuel Shirley and Edna Holt Marston Endowed Professor of Communication and Director of the Social Justice Initiative in Department of Communication at University of Texas at El Paso since 2007, William J. Clinton Distinguished Fellow at the Clinton School of Public Service since 2010 and Distinguished Professor 2 in the Faculty of Business Administration, Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, since 2015.  Education and career  During his life in India, Singhal pursued a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at University of Delhi and graduated in 1983. After moving to the United States, he earned his first Master of Arts (M.A.) in Radio-Film-TV at Bowling Green State University, Ohio in 1985. Eventually, Singhal enrolled at Annenberg School for Communication at University of Southern California, Los Angeles where he earned his second Master of Arts in Communication Theory and Research (1989) and Ph.D. in Communication Theory and Research (1990). Singhal began his teaching career as a Lecturer in Department of Communication Studies, California State University, Los Angeles in 1989. He subsequently taught at multiple institutions such as University of California, Los Angeles (1990), Ohio University (multiple appointments between 1991 and 2007), University of Southern California (1995 to 2000) and Chemnitz University of Technology (2009). He also served as visiting faculty on multiple institutions globally during the period. In 2007, he was appointed as the Samuel Shirley and Edna Holt Marston Endowed Professor of Communication and Director of Social Justice Initiative at University of Texas at El Paso. In 2010, he became a William J. Clinton Distinguished Fellow, Clinton School of Public Service, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Arkansas. In 2015, he was also named Distinguished Professor 2 at the Faculty of Business Administration, Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences and Presidential Scholar at Mudra Institute of Communication Arts (MICA), Ahmedabad, India. Over his career, Singhal also took upon many projects as consultant for international organizations such as UNICEF, World Bank, several national and regional governments and private corporations.  Major contributions  = Diffusion of innovations = During his years at Annenberg School of Communication at University of Southern California, Singhal worked extensively with the communication theorist Everett Rogers, who was also his mentor. Rogers was renowned for his work on the theory of diffusion of innovations, which dictated that: 302x302px > \\"Adopters of any new innovation or idea can be categorized as innovators > (2.5%), early adopters (13.5%), early majority (34%), late majority (34%) > and laggards (16%), based on the mathematically based Bell curve. When > graphed, the rate of adoption formed what came to typify the Diffusion of > Innovations model, a logistic curve. The graph shows a cumulative percentage > of adopters over time‚Äìslow at the start, more rapid as adoption increases, > then levelling off until only a small percentage of laggards have not > adopted.\\"Everett M. Rogers, Diffusion of Innovation (3rd Ed.), New York, NY: > Free Press, 1983. Singhal defines diffusion as \\"the process by which an innovation is filtered through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.\\" and innovation as \\"an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption.\\" Collectively he treats diffusion of innovations as a communications process as no diffusion is possible without dissemination of information amongst the individuals. He argued that while the theory was not an ideology, it was construed ideologically analogous to the \\"trickle-down\\" approach in economics. The theory in Singhal's opinion does not want one \\"to wait\\" for diffusion of a new innovation to reach the poorest of the poor (often regarded as late adopters), and believes that the rate of adoption by any segment can be accelerated using communication and outreach strategies. He also argues for 'decentralized diffusion' (a process where diffusion of any product or practice is propagated by multiple actors) as one of the strategies to achieve this end. = Positive deviance (PD) approach = Singhal's main contribution lies in the adoption of positive deviance (or PD) approach to research. He argues that solutions to complex social problems exist in the communities as some type of tacit knowledge but are hidden from plain view, and PD approach comes in handy in identifying the tacit knowledge and expanding its prevalence within the community. The PD approach identifies individuals within communities and groups whose uncommon behaviours and strategies enable them find better solutions to the problems experienced by the community, considering that these individuals ought to have the same resources as their peers. These individuals are identified as 'positive outliers' or 'positive deviants' when their traits are unusually better compared to their peers in the same group characterized by similar socio- economic parameters. For instance, a particular child recorded an unusually good body-mass index in a community of malnourished children where all of them live in similar socio-economic conditions and the child in question has no identifiable privileges than distinguishes the child from others in its category.Arvind Singhal, Prucia Buscell, and Curt Lindberg (2014). Inspiring Change and Saving Lives: The Positive Deviance Way. Bordentown, NJ: PlexusPress. , Singhal, A., Sternin, J. and Dura, L. (2009) Combating malnutrition: Positive deviance grows roots in Vietnam in the land of a thousand rice fields. Positive deviance wisdom series, 1, pp. 1-8. Singhal explains that PD approach consists of four stages: # Awareness and breakout of the community \\"mental prisons\\". 'Mental prisons' are preconceived notions, biases and even practices that prevent the researchers and the communities from identifying solutions that might in plain sight. # Identifying the positive deviants - the carriers of the authentic experience and valuable tacit knowledge. Some members of the community are able to exhibit superior traits than their peers even when they are subject to the same socio-economic conditions. The researchers ought to identify what these positive deviants are doing differently with their resources that make them exhibit traits that are uncommon for their group. # Creation of particular methods to facilitate the \\"paradigm shift\\". Once the practices of positive deviants are identified, their methods ought to be disseminated to the rest of the community to allow for a 'paradigm shift' for the community and for adoption of the said practices in their daily lives. # Community members embrace the new practice, spurred by the self-discovery and social proof. The community adopts the practices of the positive deviants and their traits improve reasonably. The researchers measure the impact of the adopted practices. Many of Singhal's written works advocate for expansion of PD approach in addressing issues of public health, malnutrition, social behaviours and education. Singhal notes that PD has been used to address issues such as malnutrition, eradication of female genital mutilation, human trafficking, increasing school retention rates, and promoting use of condoms among commercial sex workers. = Liberating interactional structures = Singhal's work advocates that learning and communication can be made more accessible by incorporating the Liberating Structures model, which consists of simple protocols of reorganizing classrooms through different spatial arrangements, group configurations, distribution of participation, and sequencing of steps. Classrooms that incorporate the model allow for equitable student participation, peer- learning, and building of connections, trust, and immediacy. The teacher in such a classroom only assumes the role of facilitator instead of a lecturer and helps the group in exploring solutions. Although, liberating structures are not limited to classroom settings. Singhal also conducted multiple workshops to incorporate liberating structures in other sectors, such as healthcare. = Entertainment-education strategy = Singhal also advocates for a theory-based communication strategy to facilitate learning called Entertainment-Education (E-E), he claims is a purposeful embedding of educational and social issues in entertainment programs or products to achieve social-behavioural change in any given society. An E-E strategy is directed at an intended media user population, comprising audiences of mass media products (newspapers, films, television, and radio) and/or consumers of games and virtual environments. Singhal's approach to E-E theory is based on works of Albert Bandura, specifically, the social learning theory and social cognitive theory. Singhal's work in E-E has investigated the dimensions of paradoxes, contradictions, and audience members' struggles in the process of media- stimulated change, a process involving parasocial interaction, peer communication, and collective efficacy. He notes that E-E has been successfully incorporated in hundreds of social change projects and as a field of communication research and practice, E-E \\"...continues to make richer, deeper, and wider connections with other social science and humanistic disciplines.\\"  Works  Singhal has worked on several books, articles and funded research projects. He authored upwards of 170 peer-reviewed articles in journals such as the Journal of Communication, Communication Theory, Communication Monographs, Health Communication, Management Communication Quarterly; Communication Quarterly, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Journal of Health Communication etc. = Books = * Arvind Singhal and Everett M.

The name Stanley, probably referring to this site, means a clearing on stony ground. The terrain is of boulder clay, and the underlying rock is millstone grit. Features Some cottages in Stanley were built in the 1860s for workers at flint mills, of which there were three in the 19th century.

The disc consists of two EPs: Gipsy by Hair Peace Salon and Pick Me Up by Jitters.  History  By the end of spring 2006, two bands of Hair Peace Salon and Jitters decided to unite on a single disc. In fall 2006 Jitters presented the single ‚ÄúPick Me Up,‚Äù while Hair Peace Salon was preparing a maxi-single on 5 songs, but since a full album would not work out from such a number of tracks, the friendly bands decided to put together a split album. According to Artur Luchkov, drummer of Hair Peace Salon, it had had already accumulated material, which would be enough for a solo album, but the band had not ‚Äúmatured for an album‚Äù yet. Already in the early spring of 2007, in a conversation with BelGazeta, impresario Jan Busiel pinned ‚Äúhigh hopes‚Äù on the next single of Hair Peace Salon. After the attempts of Hair Peace Salon to play with session keyboardists for a few quarters, including on stage during the festival ‚ÄúAcoustics of Spring‚Äù in March 2007, in connection with Konstantin Karman's six-month foreign business trip, at the end of 2007 the number of official band members increased. Konstantin paused the existence of his band Jitters and was invited to play in Hair Peace Salon on a regular basis. The ex-leader of Jitters was very pleased that he played music together then. It is noticeable that the former bassist and vocalist became keyboardist and vocalist of Hair Peace Salon, because the band already had a bass player, while the artist who had been known to the guys from joint performances bought a Roland JP-8000 synthesizer during a business trip to Scotland, which served as the material basis to positively respond to the proposal of the colleagues to change his profile. At its time, Jitters recorded and mixed its songs on a recording studio in Baranavichy for only 2 months, while Hair Peace Salon decided to record by itself, experiment, and seek its sound, so the whole recording process took a lot more time. The concert boom of Hair Peace Salon of 2007 allowed to put the finishing touches to new songs that would be included on the single ‚ÄúGipsy‚Äù and then on the split. That mini-CD was released on October 28, 2007, and spread through contact with musicians. During that time, Jitters managed to present its record, give a final concert to the audience, and scatter all over the world, but the idea of a split album not disappeared and was transformed into a conceptual CD. ‚ÄúThe disc is a little story of two friendly bands that were previously on their own, then united,‚Äù Konstantin Karman recalled the friendship of both groups for the music portal xlam.by. On October 25, 2007, a joint album compilation entitled ‚ÄúSplit Before, Together Now‚Äù was released on the record label West Records to promote new cooperation. Aleh Vial, leader of Hair Peace Salon, said Aliena Skarabahatava from Tuzin.fm that the main idea of its songs was a spiritual search of the man, and answering the same question on what is its part of the CD about, Jitters‚Äô frontman Konstantin Karman added that its tracks represented dissatisfaction with what we had then. The bands become henceforth officially united. ‚ÄúWe decided to temporarily ‚Äûfreeze‚Äú the Jitters project,‚Äù Konstantin Karman told the republican portal of alternative music xlam.by on the eve of the presentation of the joint album. ‚ÄúAnd since we have been acquainted and on friendly terms with Hair Peace Salon for a long time, there were no obstacles for unification. We have been ‚Äûexchanging‚Äú musicians previously. There will be two voices in HPS now.‚Äù The compilation was presented on November 18, 2007, in Minsk at the ‚ÄúGoodwin‚Äù club with the support of the bands Open Space, The Blackmail, and other artists, and, as Alena ‚ÄúAresha‚Äù Sobolevskaya from the music portal LiveSound.by stressed, there was a beautiful concert, without superfluous people and ‚Äúoff-topic‚Äù music.  Critical reception  ‚ÄúDespite the abundance of bands that play in the style of Brit-rock, this musical trend in our country has long remained in the shadows. And now a breakthrough came about,‚Äù the music portal LiveSound.by embraced the release of the compilation. Through the prism of the review of the album Gentleman by Hair Peace Salon, Siarhei Budkin, music critic over at Budzma Belarusians!, expressed sadness that ‚Äúthe outstanding works‚Äù ‚ÄúHover,‚Äù ‚ÄúGipsy‚Äù did not make its cut. ‚ÄúBelarusians desperately jar guitars and bawl: it turns out into Brit-rock with the dizzy weaves of harmonies √† la The Mars Volta, technically good guitar arpeggios √† la Muse, and neurotic and sensual intonations √† la Travis,‚Äù Tat‚Äôyana Zamirovskaya, journalist from the weekly BelGazeta, wrote about the Hair Peace Salon‚Äôs portion of the disc, putting up a takeaway that the band‚Äôs melodies in an incredible way resemble the Radiohead‚Äôs album of 2007 ‚ÄúIn Rainbows,‚Äù which came out after the material of the disc had been recorded. In her review, Alena Sobolevskaya from the Muzykalnaya Gazeta shared the opinion of the colleague on the musical tune and reflected upon the hysterical vocals, depressive bright melodies, and clever minor emotions. In her review of the album ‚ÄúSplit Before, Together Now,‚Äù Tat‚Äôyana Zamirovskaya described the music of Jitters with the words ‚Äúannoying, authentic and blues-like eccentric ‚Äì it has a crazy dancing Gomez-like and Happy Mondays-like style, and there are no pretentious reflections.‚Äù On the pages of the Muzykalnaya Gazeta, Alena Sobolevskaya appreciated the naughtiness and dance guitar rock of Jitters and compared the music of both bands with the works of Travis, Radiohead, Muse, Blur, and Coldplay.  CD layout  As Aleh Vial recalled to xlam.by, the initial idea of the cover, which reflects the concept of the disc (tied together black and white shoes), came to Konstantin Karman and Eugene Vial, the first of drummer Jitters. Musicians said Aliena Skarabahatava, journalist over at Tuzin.fm, they had a lot of cover ideas, but bound together different boots were the most interesting solution, because ‚Äúwe are different but interconnected with laces like those boots.‚Äù Band members were looking for shoes that would suit for shooting, carrying away by the sight of Minskers‚Äô plimsolls, and then went to the section of children‚Äôs shoes and realized that this is what was needed. It turned out that no photographing was allowed in outlets, so they had to rent a pair of the children‚Äôs ones in a secondhand store in Zhdanovichi. As Alena Sobolevskaya from the Muzykalnaya Gazeta evaluated the choice of cover, this design fitted the bands well, since they preserved funny spontaneity and inner kindness. ‚ÄúThe result was such a nice cover here, which is very pleasant to all,‚Äù Aleh Vial summarized a result for the Belarusian Students‚Äô Association.  Awards and nominations. Commercial success  The first song of the collection ‚ÄúHover‚Äù became the triumphant anthem of Hair Peace Salon, which allowed to successfully pass the qualifying rounds and take the first prize (recording in a professional music studio) of the ¬´¬ª contest in 2007. With the program basically made up of songs from the split album, musicians successfully participated in other music competitions, such as the ‚ÄúMusical Playoffs‚Äù (semi-finalists), the ‚ÄúRock Sparring‚Äù (the prize of studio recording owners), the ‚ÄúGolden Acoustics‚Äù (the winners). ‚ÄúWe are very pleased that listeners chose us as the winners of this competition,‚Äù Aleh Vial, Hair Peace Salon‚Äôs frontman, remembered the peripeteia of the competition for Tuzin.fm and revealed the idea further, ‚ÄúThe Acoustics had success among the audience. But we are not satisfied in this regard. Of course, it is nice to win, but, personally, I am ready for anything.‚Äù Owing to the album and concert- competitive activities on the basis of the songs from it, the band Hair Peace Salon was nominated in the category of ‚ÄúBreakthrough of the Year‚Äù at the ‚ÄúRock Coronation 2007‚Äù ceremony in February 2008. According to Charter 97, the CD was put in the list of top 50 discs as to sales for its year. In general, audio materials were included in radio rotation, boosted the presence of rockers in the information space. Weighing in on the expansion of the company‚Äôs catalogue with the released disc at the end of 2007, Siarhiej Jasiuƒçenia, director of West Records, noted that his label was trying to ‚Äúkeep an eye on musical trends.‚Äù  Tracklisting   Personnel  Hair Peace Salon : * Aleh Vial ‚Äî lead vocals, guitars. * Konstantin Karman ‚Äî back vocals, synthesizer. * Maxim ‚ÄúGandibober‚Äù Devichensky ‚Äî bass. * Artur Luchkov ‚Äî drums.

Music videos  During the filming of the show ‚ÄúMusical Playoffs‚Äù in fall 2007, impressed by the performance of the band director Anatoƒ∫ Vieƒçar made an offer of creative cooperation to the members of Hair Peace Salon. Already in early 2008, the band's frontman Aleh Vial told Tuzin.fm on the plans to shoot a music video, ‚ÄúWe are now convinced that we need it. In February, we will begin work and take something from the new for video-embodiment.‚Äù The official video for the eponymous lead single ‚ÄúHover,‚Äù which presented the new look of the band that was together with Konstantin Karman then, was shot in February 2008 and aired on TV in the program of the LAD channel ‚ÄúPro –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ+‚Äù before long. In the analysis of the Silent Hill-esque music video, X from ‚ÄúLiveSound.by‚Äù noted an interesting directorial and cameraman work, but also pointed out shortcomings in acting.  Cover versions  For the compilation of Budzma Belarusians! and European Radio for Belarus ‚ÄúBudzma The Best Rock / Budzma The Best Rock/New,‚Äù in 2009 the band Hair Peace Salon covered the song ‚ÄúGipsy,‚Äù which was already dedicated to the Ursari, in the Belarusian language as ‚Äú.‚Äù Aleh Vial, leader of Hair Peace Salon, once told Aliena Skarabahatava from Tuzin.fm that the English word ‚ÄúGipsy‚Äù means the Romani people and the song describes the state of roving on life in a spiritual sense too. Belarusian man of letters Vital Voranau acted as the author of the literary translation of the lyrics; ‚ÄúThis is a three years old composition and we are no longer satisfied with some fragments of the text. When translating, Vital wrote the text anew,‚Äù musicians drew attention to the joint-work. ‚ÄúThe Belarusization of non-Belarusian lyrics by Belarusian bands is a great advanced training school,‚Äù the poet explained his approach to work and added that the results of Belarusization allow musicians to more gracefully integrate into the domestic context. As a result, expert of Tuzin.fm Ihar Nazaranka highlighted that to listen to the song in Belarusian suits him more. He was also echoed by Siarhei Budkin, expert staffer over at Experty.by, who in 2012 warmly remembered ‚Äúquite successful experiments of musicians with the Belarusian language‚Äù on the example of the same song. ‚ÄúVital made a very successful interpretation of the original text,‚Äù Konstantin Karman, singer- keyboardist on the song, said and added, ‚ÄúNow there is a feeling that the ‚Äûunderstandable‚Äú lyrics is more thoroughly conveys the true atmosphere of the song.‚Äù Another music critic over at Tuzin.fm Sieviaryn Kviatko≈≠ski put into words that ‚ÄúCia≈Ñki‚Äù reminded him the works of Polish rock band Czerwone Gitary and Paul McCartney touched up in the contemporary Britpop style. The song ‚ÄúCia≈Ñki‚Äù was charted in the charts of Tuzin.fm, but stopped in the pre-final part of the ‚ÄúMegatour-2010.‚Äù  References   External links  * Download the EP ¬´Gipsy¬ª (Bandcamp) * Download the EP ¬´Pick Me Up¬ª (Bandcamp) * Music video on Hover (YouTube) Category:Britpop albums Category:Britpop compilation albums Category:Hair Peace Salon albums Category:Jitters (band) albums Category:2007 compilation albums Category:Split albums ","title":"Split Before, Together Now"},{"id":"61749700","text":"Below the Border is a 1941 American Western film directed by Howard Bretherton and written by Adele Buffington.

(, ) Since 1988, he has been engaged in pioneering research in the field of computer analysis of medical images, image-guided therapy and surgical simulation. A central focus of his work is the introduction of geometric, statistical, physical or functional models of the human body for the analysis and simulation of medical images. His current research focuses on the introduction of artificial intelligence algorithms to guide the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic management of patients based on medical images and all available patient data (clinical, biological, behavioural, etc.). The research work of Nicholas Ayache and his collaborators has made a decisive contribution to the development of digital medicine worldwide.

After his RAF service, he became an usher for Black Rod and a Deputy Lord Lieutenant for Greater London. Early life Hawkins was born in Streatham, South London in April 1937 and educated at Worth School and Downside. RAF career Hawkins joined the RAF in 1955 as a gunner in the RAF Regiment, but was awarded a short commission in 1956, with the commissioning becoming permanent in 1959. His infantry training was at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, with Hawkins being the last RAF officer to undergo the training there before the RAF took on training its own Regiment officers. In 1971, he was appointed as the officer commanding No. 37 Squadron RAF Regiment, then based at RAF Catterick in North Yorkshire with frequent deployments to Northern Ireland. In 1974, he was the officer commanding the Queen's Colour Squadron (QCS). Whilst in command at QCS, he and his men appeared on the Generation Game with Bruce Forsyth, where they performed their drill manoeuvres for the contestants to emulate. In 1977, he was awarded the Member of the British Empire. After being promoted to wing commander and then group captain, Hawkins undertook a number of staff posts at AAFCE and HQ Strike Command in High Wycombe, with other postings to RAF Catterick and one as the Director of Personal Services within the RAF HQ. By 1991 and in the rank of air vice-marshal, he took on the role of the Commandant-General of the RAF Regiment. In 1992, Hawkins was elevated to a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath. In 1993, Hawkins relinquished his appointment as Commandant General of the RAF Regiment, and retired from active service, being succeeded by T G Thorn. Later career Following retirement from the RAF, he was appointed Director of Military and Government Affairs for WDSL Aerospace Ltd, and he took on a similar post with Coltraco Ultrasonics Ltd in 2014, as well as being a member of Safe Waste and Power consultants. Hawkins was also a Gentleman Usher to the Queen (invested in 1994), a Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod between 1993 and 1998, and a Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Greater London between 1994 and 2012. As a Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod, Hawkins was known not to be one who shirked his duties; in 1995, Hawkins sent a typed letter to Sir Geoffrey Howe instructing him to cease ongoing proceedings in the House of Lords that were being filmed in relation to a debate on the single European currency. The conference was in some unspecified way breaking the rules of the house and attending film crews were warned that they would have their media passes revoked if they broadcast the footage of the event. He was elevated to a Lieutenant in the Royal Victorian Order in 2007. Personal life Hawkins was married three times; first to Wendy Harris (1965‚Äì1981), secondly to Elaine Nelson (1982‚Äì1997), and thirdly, in 1998, to Karen Hansen-d‚ÄôLeth, a dentist who had a surgery in Harley Street. He adopted his wife‚Äôs name as part of his surname to become Hawkins-Leth. When his wife retired, they moved to Denmark, but in ill-health, Hawkins returned to London in the last days of his life. He died on 31 January 2019.

K√ºttim worked with mentor and friend, journalist Hannes R√•stam and together they revealed Quick made false confessions, which resulted in the making of three award winning documentaries. The documentaries reviewed the police investigation and revealed how Quick was fed with information and was guided through the crime scenes, high on drug-classed medication, which he had free access to. Meanwhile he was treated in therapy for so-called repressed memories that led him to admit the eight murders he had not committed. K√ºttim also helped compile the facts for her R√•stam's book Thomas Quick: The Making of a Serial Killer which was published post mortem. The book was finished just the day before he died, at the age of 56, from cancer of the pancreas and liver in January 2012.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/thomas-quick- bergwall-sweden-murder K√ºttim continued to work on Quick's story and together with college Dan Josefsson produced the documentary: The woman behind Thomas Quick which revealed the group of people that enabled the myth of Thomas Quick. The deeper investigation revealed the dynamic of group think which enabled the story of the serial killer who never was.

Life and works  John Lundqvist first studied at Tekniska Skolan (today Konstfack) and was thereafter assistant to Christian Eriksson between 1907-1313. In 1913 he studied at Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris where Auguste Rodin made an impression on him. In the years 1919-127 he lived in Paris. He advanced his education in Copenhagen and Italy. His works were characterized by a deeply religious way of life. His inspiration is collected from French sculptor Auguste Rodin and gothic sculptures, but there are also clear similarities to Carl Milles. John Lundqvist mainly devoted himself to church decorations, such as Uppst√•ndelsemonumentet by Heliga Korsets kapell at Skogskyrkog√•rden in Stockholm, Sweden. Lundqvist have also made the crucifix's gilded Christ figure. Other famous works include Uppst√•ndelsen (at Nationalmuseum) and Orfeus, pilot studies of Uppst√•ndelsemonumentet, the crucifix at the Swedish church in Paris (1926), Job, Tv√• m√§nniskorI (1923), and the fountain composition Forskarlen (1933, for Laholm municipality). John Lundqvist is represented at, among other, Moderna Museet, National Museum of Fine Arts, and Kalmar art museum.

In histopathology, a palisade is a single layer of relatively long cells, arranged loosely perpendicular to a surface and parallel to each other. A rosette is a palisade in a halo or spoke-and-wheel arrangement, surrounding a central core or hub. A pseudorosette is a perivascular radial arrangement of neoplastic cells around a small blood vessel. Rosette Structure of a rosette in pathology flower-like architectural ornament.Largely copied from: Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) A rosette is a cell formation in a halo or spoke-and-wheel arrangement, surrounding a central core or hub. The central hub may consist of an empty-appearing lumen or a space filled with cytoplasmic processes. The cytoplasm of each of the cells in the rosette is often wedge-shaped with the apex directed toward the central core: the nuclei of the cells participating in the rosette are peripherally positioned and form a ring or halo around the hub. =Pathogenesis= Rosettes may be considered primary or secondary manifestations of tumor architecture. Primary rosettes form as a characteristic growth pattern of a given tumor type whereas secondary rosettes result from the influece of external factors on tumor growth. For example, in the latter instance, regressive cell swelling may centripetally displace the cytoplasm as the nucleus is squeezed to the periphery. Although the presence of primary rosettes may suggest a given diagnosis, usually this finding alone is not considered absolutely pathognomic for one specific tumor type. Loss or gain of genetic information is the main cause of rosette and pseudorosette formation. The cell populations exhibiting neuronal differentiation are believed to secrete surface glycoproteins and glycolipids which mediate cell-to-cell recognition and adhesion. One hypothesis is that these sticky cell surface markers cause the developing cell bodies to cluster or aggregate and their primitive neurites to tangle. As the cells grow, the neurite tangle remains centrally located and the cell bodies are squeezed to the periphery, thus explaining the rosette pattern. Depending upon their location, ependymal cells may display 2 cell poles. A luminal pole projects to the ependymal lining of a ventricle and a ‚Äúsubmesenchymal pole‚Äù projects toward the surface of the brain demonstrating glial processes and peripherally situated footplates. Frieda and Pollak conceptualize the architecture of ependymomas as a primitive neural tube turned inside out with the submesenchymal poles converging toward a central vessel, thus forming a pseudorosette rather than projecting centrifugally toward the pia. =Causes= True rosettes are mainly found in neuropathologic disorder and are also present in osteosarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, fibromyxoid sarcoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR), rhambdomyosarcoma, chronic cholestasis and chronic active hepatitis, tobacco rosette: complex viral disease, malaria, adenocarcinoma in colon and rectum in the Aghamiri population, hyalinizing spindle cell fused with giant rosette, endometrial stromal sarcoma with hyalinizing giant rosettes, embryonal tumor etc. Flexner‚ÄìWintersteiner rosettes (spoke-and-wheel shaped cell formation seen mainly in retinoblastomaDefinition of 'rosette', from The Free Dictionary.

File:Structure of a Flexner‚ÄìWintersteiner rosette.jpgStructure of a Flexner‚ÄìWintersteiner rosette Flexner‚ÄìWintersteiner rosettes were first described by Simon Flexner (1863‚Äì1946), a physician, scientist, administrator, and professor of experimental pathology at the University of Pennsylvania (1899‚Äì1903). Flexner noted characteristic clusters of cells in an infantile eye tumor which he called retinoepithelioma.Flexner S. A peculiar glioma (neuroepithelioma?) of the retina.

Hosp Pract 1988;23:213‚Äì66 A few years later, in 1897, Austrian ophthalmologist Hugo Wintersteiner (1865‚Äì1946) confirmed Flexner‚Äôs observations and noted that the cell clusters resembled rods and cones.Wintersteiner H. Die zellen der geschwulst. In: Das neuroepithelioma retinae: Eine anatomische und klinishe studie. Leipzig: Franz Deuticke; 1897:12‚Äì16 These characteristic rosette formations were subsequently recognized as important features of retinoblastomas. Pseudorosette A pseudorosette is a perivascular radial arrangement of neoplastic cells around a small blood vessel. Pseudorosettes are present in neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, malignant melanoma, ependymoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumor of skin, seborrheic keratosis, dendritic cell neurofibroma, astroblastoma, large cell neuroendocrine tumor of cervix, clear cell ependymoma of spinal cord, celiac disease, nasal tumor of olfactory origin, rosette forming glioneural tumor (RGNT), oncocytoma, Wilm‚Äôs tumor, pheochromocytoma of urinary bladder. =Homer Wright pseudorosette= Micrograph of Homer Wright pseudorosettes A Homer Wright pseudorosette is a type of pseudorosette in which differentiated tumor cells surround the neuropil. Examples of tumors containing these are neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, pinealoblastoma, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors of bone. Homer Wright rosettes are considered \\"pseudo\\" in the sense that they are not true rosettes. True rosettes are Flexner‚ÄìWintersteiner rosette, which contain an empty lumen. Homer Wright rosettes contain abundant fibrillary material. They are named for James Homer Wright. File:Structure of a Homer Wright pseudorosette.jpgStructure of a Homer Wright pseudorosette =Perivascular pseudorosette= A perivascular pseudorosette consists of a spoke-wheel arrangement of cells with tapered cellular processes radiates around a wall of a centrally placed vessel. The modifier ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù differentiates this pattern from the Homer Wright and Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, perhaps because the central structure is not actually formed by the tumor itself, but instead represents a native, non-neoplastic element. Also, some early investigators argued about the definition of a central lumen, choosing ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù to indicate that the hub was not a true lumen but contained structures. Nevertheless, this pattern remains extremely diagnostically useful and the modifier unnecessarily leads to confusion. Perivascular pseudorosettes are encountered in most ependymomas regardless of grade or variant. As such, they are significantly more sensitive for the diagnosis of ependymomas than true ependymal rosettes. Unfortunately, perivascular pseudorosettes are also less specific in that they are also encountered in medulloblastomas, PNETs, central neurocytomas, and less often in glioblastomas, and a rare pediatric tumor, monomorphous pilomyxoid astrocytomas. File:Micrograph of perivascular pseudorosettes.jpgMicrograph of perivascular pseudorosettes File:Structure of a perivascular pseudorosette.jpgStructure of a perivascular pseudorosette =Pineocytomatous/neurocytic pseudorosettes= Histologic features of these two tumors are virtually identical, including their tendency to form neuropilrich rosettes, referred to as pineocytomatous/neurocytic rosettes in central neurocytoma. Both are quite similar to the Homer Wright rosette, but they are generally larger and more irregular in contour. The cells of the pineocytomatous/neurocytic rosettes are also considered to be much more differentiated than the cells forming Homer Wright rosettes in that the nuclei are slightly larger, more rounded, much less mitotically active, and paler or less hyperchromatic. In rare cases, these rosettes may aggregate in a sheet of back-to-back clusters resembling field stone pavement. File:Micrograph of pineocytomatous-neurocytic pseudorosettes.jpgMicrograph of pineocytomatous/neurocytic pseudorosettes File:Structure of pineocytomatous- neurocytic pseudorosettes.jpgStructure of pineocytomatous/neurocytic pseudorosettes Clinical significance of rosettes and pseudorosettes The neuropathologic diagnosis of brain tumors entails the microscopic examination of conventional formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples surgically removed from a radiographically defined lesion. Pathologists rely on visual clues such as pattern recognition when examining the stained tissue with a microscope, much as radiologists rely on grayscale patterns of densities and intensities on images. Some histologic patterns of cellular architecture are distinctive if not pathognomonic whereas others are less specific, but nevertheless considerably narrow the differential diagnosis. The precise biologic bases for some of the observed microscopic patterns are poorly understood though their recognition remains useful nonetheless. One commonly encountered neuropathologic histologic architectural pattern seen within certain tumors is the rosette. The purpose of this report is to review the patterns of rosettes and pseudorosettes in the context of such tumors as medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), retinoblastoma, ependymoma, central neurocytoma and pineocytoma. Methods for diagnosis of rosettes and pseudorosettes More advanced methods of tissue examination such as histochemical and immunohistochemical profiling, genetic analysis, and electron microscopy have been developed, the microscopic review of H&E; stained material remains a critical component of tumor diagnosis. Immunohistochemical evidence of neuronal differentiation is found in nearly all cases with neuronal markers such as synaptophysin, neuronspecific enolase, and neurofilament protein. Some medulloblastomas may also display other forms of differentiation as demonstrated by the presence of the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. Skeletal muscle and melanocytic differentiation are considerably less common and define the medullomyoblastoma and melanotic medulloblastoma variants, respectively. Long palisades Palisading in nodular basal-cell carcinoma. Palisades that are generally longer than a rosette or pseudorosette can be seen in neural tumors such as Schwannoma, as well as in ameloblastomas. It can also be seen in nodular basal-cell carcinomas.Initially copied from: Visually similar findings Pseudopalisading, a visually similar finding, is the formation of hypercellular zones that typically surrounds necrotic tissue.

He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences, section mechanical and computer sciences, and of the French Academy of Technology.  Biography  Born in France, to a Belarusian father who came to France in 1905 and a Ukrainian mother who came to France in 1902, he escaped the Holocaust during the Second World War. After the war, he prepared as a free candidate for the entrance exam to the √âcole nationale des arts et m√©tiers. He was awarded the top promotion in the promotion that entered Paris in 1945 (Pa45 promotion). On the advice of his professors, he passed the √âcole polytechnique exam in 1949, where he graduated as a major, then joined the CEA/Saclay in the mathematical physics department headed by Jacques Yvon, Jules Horowitz, Albert Messiah, Anatole Abragam, Claude Bloch, Trocheris, etc... Scientific Director of the CEA, he contributes to the development of atomic applications after scientific work on isotopic regulation and the construction of experimental reactors (Grenoble high flux reactor). He is working on the process of separating uranium isotopes. He is the director of the Ph√©bus large laser program. Robert Dautray was High Commissioner for Atomic Energy from 1993 to 1998. Robert Dautray recounted his memories, especially his difficult youth, in his book of Memoirs, published in 2007Robert Dautray, M√©moires, du Vel d'Hiv √† la bombe H, Paris, Odile Jacob, 2007. Chairman of the Scientific Programs Committee of the National Space Center (CNES). He also addressed the problems of climate change (radiative transfer: greenhouse effect)Robert Dautray et Jacques Lesourne, L'humanit√© face au changement climatique, Paris, Odile Jacob, 2009  Scientific work  Almost all of Robert Dautray's professional activity has been devoted to the physical sciences contributing to nuclear energy, both in reactor physics (reactor control and command, breeder reactor physics, Pegasus research reactors, high-flow reactors from the Von Laue Langevin Institute, etc.) and in the physics of reactors.) and upstream of the fuel cycle (control command of the uranium isotope separation plant) as well as downstream of this cycle (formation and physics of plutonium and other actinides isotopes, descendants of fission products, activated structure nuclei, etc.). In addition, Robert Dautray participated in the establishment of the basic physical sciences for the sciences of high densities and powers of materials and electromagnetic radiation (state equations, opacity, radiative transfer, discontinuities of high velocity flows, interface instabilities, laser implosions, thermonuclear reactions, non-linear neutronics of high velocity media of nuclei making the neutron transport and plasma physics equations non-linear, etc.). Robert Dautray has contributed to the development of the mathematical methods necessary to model these phenomena. Robert Dautray co-chaired with the EDF Studies and Research Department the CEA/EDF digital analysis summer schools. There was a controversy over the attribution to R. Dautray of the paternity of the French H-bomb. Experts dispute it, highlighting Michel Carayol's work (see for example Pierre Billaud, La v√©ridique histoire de la bombe H fran√ßaise, La Pens√©e universelle, 1994 and the website http://www.bombehlaverite.com[archive]).

In 1872, Taubert married von Hartmann, in Berlin-Charlottenburg and had a child with him. Taubert was a staunch supporter of her husband's work The Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869) and wrote two books which both critiqued and defended his ideas.

In the text, she defined the problem that philosophical pessimism engages with as \\"a matter of measuring the eudaimonological value of life in order to determine whether existence is preferable to non-existence or not\\". Taubert has been described as \\"one of the first women to have a prominent role in a public intellectual debate in Germany\\" and has been compared to Olga Pl√ºmacher, a contemporary female philosopher, who also had a significant role in the pessimism controversy.

The Brigades were mostly made up of communists, but also included members of other parties of the National Liberation Committee (NLC), in particular the Italian Socialist Party. Led by Luigi Longo and Pietro Secchia, they were the largest of the partisan groups and suffered the highest number of losses. Members wore a red handkerchief around the neck with red stars on their hats.  History  = Operative design = On 20 September 1943 in Milano, the military committee of PCI was formed and in October it became in the general command of the Brigate d'assalto Garibaldi (Garibaldi Assault Brigades) under the leadership of Longo and Secchia. This early management structure, initially equipped with poor means, began immediately its activity in order to overcome every \\"wait and see\\" attitudes and constantly potentiate of the military activities against the occupying power (the Nazi Germany) and the fascist structures of the Italian Social Republic.. The general command of the brigades ordered the formation of a relay system from the communist cells already active in the cities, in order to link militant units among the various zones, the strengthen of connections and the actual carrying out of the partisan struggle. For this purpose, it was established that the 50% of militants had to be assigned to the military activity.. A body of inspectors was assigned to the various regions with the task to control the partisan activity of brigades and to develop their political-military activity. Members of the general command were later decentralised, the main leadership was located in Milan and detached delegations were formed in each region under the guide by a command member with wide decisional powers. After the war declaration to Germany by Badoglio I Cabinet on 13 October 1943, the general command of BG issued a document (Direttive d'attacco, \\"Attack Directives\\") in line with the political directives of PCI in favour of the organization and intensification of the partisan war, characterized by a claim for legality and a call to a resolute fight against Germans and militants of the fascist RSI. In November 1943, Pietro Secchia wrote an article on PCI journal La nostra lotta defining the political-military project adopted by BGs: he claimed the importance of the immediate military action in order to \\"shorten the war\\" and reduce the period of the German occupation, saving people and villages; in order to demonstrate to Allies the will of the Italian people to fight for their own freedom and democracy; to contrast the nazi-fascist policy of terror, to make the occupation unstable and to stimulate, through the actual action, the development of the partisan organization and struggle.. = Organization = The organization was structured by PCI direction. The use of the name \\"brigade\\" indicated the overcoming of the \\"band\\" and the traditional military- like organization. It was also a reference to the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War.. The partisan organization was named after general Giuseppe Garibaldi, one of the main contributors to the Italian unification. Size of brigades was different for each operative context. The structure set by PCI provided, beside a military commander, a political commissar with equal military powers but involved also in propaganda and formation of partisans; this structure was replicated also within squads, battalions and other subgroups. The word assalto (\\"assault\\") was a political choice which aimed to remove uncertainties regarding the possibility of fight and to overcome doubts in the struggle against fascists. Therefore, it was also a reference to the \\"assault units\\" of World War I.. The establishment of brigades was based on the harshness conspiracy, discipline and motivation of communist cadres but mostly on the openness and availability in recruiting volunteers, including youth, former soldiers or members of organization dismantled by the regime. In autumn 1943, the general command defined the command structure of brigades with the political commissar and the officers for the military command and chief of staff. While the 50% of PCI militants was directly involved in the military activity with the brigades, the other half was dedicated to conspiracy in the cities, organizing and developing the struggle of workers among factories, to the agitation of peasants in some zones and the infiltration among schools and universities, supporting also the recruitment and the flow of volunteers to combatant formations on mountains. During the Resistance, the separation between the two sides had never been irreversible and militants switched from an activity to another one, also if in some provinces a separation occurred between the \\"political work\\" of local leaders and the \\"military work\\" given to commanders of BGs on the field and to regional delegates with full powers..  Garibaldi Brigades during the partisan war  = Brigades = Despite the direct link with PCI, the Garibaldi Brigades had notable leaders who were not communist militants, like the catholic and apolitical Aldo Gastaldi (with the battle name \\"Bisagno\\", after the homonymous torrent stream), one of the most important partisan commanders in Genoa, the apolitical Mario Musolesi (battle name \\"Lupo\\"), leader of the Brigata Partigiana Stella Rossa killed by Germans during the roundup of Marzabotto, the anarchic Emilio Canzi, the sole commander of the 13th operative zone of Tuscan Emilian Apennines. Moreover, Aldo Aniasi remained at the command of the 2¬™ Divisione Garibaldi \\"Redi\\" in Ossola despite he had left the PCI in order to join the PSI, while Luigi Pierobon, one of the leaders of the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students of Veneto, had an important part in the creation of the Divisione Garibaldi \\"Ateo Garemi\\". Some monarchical officers also joined the BGs and obtained the command of detachments, battalions or even entire brigades, for their military preparation, like captain Ugo Ricci (among the first promoters of the resistance in the province of Como, killed in action during the battle of Lenno) and lieutenant count Luchino Dal Verme, who commanded as \\"Maino\\" the 88¬™ Brigata \\"Casotti\\" and later the entire \\"Antonio Gramsci\\" division in the Oltrep√≤ Pavese. Those situations led sometimes to diatribes and contrasts that did not reduced the common will of antifascist struggle and the related application in fight. The most famous groups of Garibaldi Brigades were those of Vincenzo Moscatelli \\"Cino\\" and Eraldo Gastone \\"Ciro\\" in the Partisan Republic of Valsesia, Pompeo Colajanni \\"Barbato\\" , Vincenzo Modica \\"Petralia\\" and Giovanni Latilla \\"Nanni\\" in Valle Po and Langhe, Francesco Moranino \\"Gemisto\\" in Biella, Mario Ricci \\"Armando\\" in Modena and Arrigo Boldrini \\"Bulow\\" in Romagna.. Together with BGs, there were the Gruppi di azione patriottica (GAP, \\"Groups of Patriotic Action\\"), specialised in sabotages and attempts against nazi-fascist occupants. GAPs and BGs represented almost 50% of the forces of the partisan Resistance. At the final insurrection of April 1945, the active garibaldini combatants were about 51,000 divided in 23 \\"divisions\\" on a total of about 100,000 partisans.. Questi calcoli comprendono le forze effettive ed efficienti, escludendo i partigiani dell'\\"ultima ora\\", entrati nelle file della Resistenza solo nel momento della vittoria finale e di scarsa utilit√† nei combattimenti. On 15 April 1945, the general command of Garibaldi Brigades was formed by nine divisions in Piedmont (15,000 members), three in Lombardy (4,000 members), four in Veneto (10,000), three in Emilia (12,000) and four divisions (10,000) in Liguria. As a military force, the BGs were the most numerous group which was organized with 575 formations; they took part to most of fights and suffered the most number of losses, with over 42,000 killed in action or after a roundup. The Garibaldini distinguished by their political symbols of their uniforms: red handkerchiefs around the neck, red stars on hats, emblems with hammer and sickle.. Despite the directives of CVL command aimed to unite all the combatant formations and to promote the use of national badges and the military salute, militants of the brigades continued to be indifferent towards those directives, remaining faithful to their traditions, and most of them continued to salute with the raised fist.. = General command = Generally, Garibaldi Brigades received orders from the PCI representative among the Corpo volontari della libert√†, who was Luigi Longo (battle name \\"Italo\\"), and from the National LIberation Committee. However, all the BGs depended directly on the general command, formed by general commander Longo, Pietro Secchia (battle name \\"Botte\\" or \\"Vineis\\"), who was also the political commissar of the brigades, Giancarlo Pajetta (\\"Luca\\", deputy commander); Giorgio Amendola (\\"Palmieri\\"), Antonio Carini (\\"Orsi\\", killed in March 1944), Francesco Leone, Umberto Massola, Antonio Roasio, Francesco Scotti and Eugenio Curiel (killed on 24 February 1945).. Those leaders developed the Garibaldi resistance movements and spread the communist influence in northern Italy.. The author proposes the opinion of Max Salvadori who defined Longo and Sereni as \\"men of steel\\". Along with Longo, Secchia and the other members of the general command, other important figures were active in the regional coordination like Antonio Roasio (\\"Paolo\\"), who controlled the brigades in Veneto and Emilia, Francesco Scotti (\\"Fausto\\" or \\"Grossi\\"), who led the formations in Piedmont and Liguria, and Pietro Vergani (\\"Fabio\\"), responsible in Lombardy. The Italian Communist Party had a decisive role in the strengthening and the organization; since the beginning, structures of the party had decided that at least the 10% of the cadres and the 15% of the subscribers had to be sent to the mountains in order to create the fundamental nucleus of aggregation and cohesion around which the units had to be developed.. Moreover, Brigate Garibaldi had their representatives in the regional commands of CVL, who were Giordano Pratolongo and then Francesco Scotti (Piedmont); Pietro Vergani (Lombardy), Liguria Luigi Pieragostini and Carlo Farini (Liguria) after his arrest on 27 December 1944, Ilio Barontini (Emilia-Romagna), Pratolongo and then Aldo Lampredi (Veneto), Luigi Gaiami and then Francesco Leone and Antonio Roasio (Tuscany), Alessandro Vaia (Marche) and Celso Ghini (Umbria). In Trieste there were Luigi Frausin and Vincenzo Gigante who, in connection with the general command, had relations with the Yugoslav partisans supporting the need to postpone the territorial revendications until the end of the war, in order to fight together against the common enemy. Frausin and Gigante were captured by the German Sicherheitsdienst on 28 August and 15 November 1944 respectively, interned and killed in the camp of Risiera di San Sabba.. A typical characteristic of the Garibaldi Brigades was the contrast attempt to transform the partisan formations into an avant-garde and constitutive element of the process of involving the populations in the active anti-fascism, with a continuous effort of integration between the armed fight and the civil mobilisation through their representatives. With a further organizational effort, communist leaders of Milan created in June 1944 the so-called \\"insurrection triumvirates\\" (triumvirati insurrezionali) at regional level, in order to coordinate the political struggle of the party among the occupied cities and in the workplaces through the concrete action of partisan mountain groups in view of a general insurrection.  Insurrection and end of the war  Commander of Garibaldi Brigades of Ossola (the first from the left is Aldo Aniasi). On 10 April 1945, the general command of Brigate Garibaldi issued the \\"directive no. 16\\" which warned all the combatants to prepare themselves for the general insurrection in all the northern Italy in order to precede the Allied troops and cooperate for the defeat of nazi-fascist forces The general command of the brigades and the Communist Party emphasized to the maximum the importance of the insurrection which had to be done at any costs, without accepting any agreements, proposals, truces with the enemy that could limit the action of partisans. Detailed plans were designed in order to enter into the cities, protect factories and plants and to prevent the run of nazi-fascist forces.. The insurrection began then on 24 and 25 April in the main cities of the north,. after that the regional commands spread the codified message \\"Aldo dice 26x1\\" (\\"Aldo says 26x1\\").. Garibaldini at the castle of Pavia, 25 April 1945. During this final phase, the Garibaldini formations, organized in \\"Divisions\\" and \\"Groups of Divisions\\" (like the grouping of Valsesia, Verbano and Ossola led by Moscatelli and Gastone), had a central role in fights among the various cities of northern Italy. Mountain partisan brigades went to the plains and marched on the main centres, while the insurrection strike was proclaimed in the urban nuclei and GAP and SAP divisions began to fight. In Liguria, the Divisions of \\"Chichero\\" played an important role in the liberation of Genoa and impede the destruction of the harbour, accepting the surrender of German forces led by general G√ºnther Meinhold. In Piedmont, Garibaldi Divisions of Pompeo Colajanni \\"Barbato\\", Vincenzo Modica and Giovanni Latilla \\"Nanni\\" entered in Turin together with the autonomous of \\"Mauri\\", while the Divisions \\"Pajetta\\" and \\"Fratelli Varalli\\" of Gastone and Moscatelli, after liberating Novara, entered in Milan on 28 April, already reached in the previous day by the Garibaldini of Oltrep√≤ pavese led by Italo Pietra and Luchino Dal Verme.. In Lombardy, the 2¬™ Divisione Garibaldi \\"Redi\\" (commanded by Aldo Aniasi \\"Comandante Iso\\") and the Divisioni \\"Lombardia\\", coordinated by Pietro Vergani (\\"Fabio\\", deputy commander of CVL) blocked the Alpine passes and occupied the Valtellina, preventing the run of fascist hierarchs. Benito Mussolini was captured by the 52¬™ Brigata Garibaldi \\"Luigi Clerici\\" of commander \\"Pedro\\" (Pier Luigi Bellini delle Stelle), subordinate to the 1¬™ Divisione Garibaldi Lombardia, and shot by envoys of the Garibaldi command of Milan, Walter Audisio and Aldo Lampredi; other hierarchs were instead captured and killed in Dongo by partisans of the 3¬™ Divisione Garibaldi Lombardia, under the orders of Alfredo Mordini \\"Riccardo\\". In Veneto, the \\"Garemi\\", \\"Nannetti\\" and \\"Ortigara\\" Divisions stopped the German retreat and freed Padova, Valdagno and Belluno... Severe problems of collaboration between the Italian partisans and the Slovenian formations of the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia arose on the eastern border, where the strong Slavic chauvinism, difficulties of Italian communist leaders and the contradictory aspects of their policy fostered divisions and anti-Slavic resentments within non-communist forces of the Resistance.. On 20 September 1944, the general command of Slovenian PLA abolished unilaterally the agreements with the NLC done in April of the same year, which provided an Italian-Slovenian \\"equal command\\" on the formations. Consequently, most of the Italian units fell under the control of the Slovenian PLA and ceased to be formations of the Corpo Volontari della Libert√† d'Italia. The commander and the political commissar adhered to the political and national solution of Yugoslavia and the political office of PCI supported that choice which involved only the communist militants.. A the moment of the final insurrection, the \\"Trieste\\" formation, aggregated to the Divisione Garibaldi \\"Natisone\\" since 27 February 1945, participated to the fights and one group of it entered in Trieste on 7 May, while the biggest division was engaged in Ljubljana and entered into the city on 20 May, because an order of the Slovenian Communist Party hindered the participation of Italian partisan formations to the liberation of Trieste. After the end of the military operations during the first days of May in 1945, Allies and NLC ordered the consignment of weapons and the dismantle of partisan units. Garibaldi Brigades, as other partisan formations, were formally disbanded and gave to Allies 215,000 rifles, 12,000 submachine guns, 5,000 machine guns, 5 000 handguns and 760 bazookas. However, among the Garibaldi partisans, there were distrust and fear of the return of reactionary forces, and only about 60% of the weapons were actually given, while communist partisans kept a conspicuous number of light weapons, caps, jackets, red handkerchiefs, backpacks and cartridge boxes.. The hiding of weapons was partially allowed by some Garibaldi leaders of the north in sight of a possible reprise of the liberation war; during all the 50s, there were expectations of a return of war in mountains against the bourgeois state firmly placed in the capitalist field..

Introduced in 1958, the series has gone through four major generations, the latest being the Simatic S7 generation. The series is intended for industrial automation and production. The name Simatic is a registered trademark of Siemens. It is a portmanteau of ‚ÄúSiemens‚Äù and ‚ÄúAutomatic‚Äù.  Function  Siemens Simatic S7-300 PLC CPU with three I/O modules attached As with other programmable logic controllers, Simatic devices are intended to separate the control of a machine from the machine's direct operation, in a more lightweight and versatile manner than controls hard-wired for a specific machine. Early Simatic devices were transistor-based, intended to replace relays attached and customized to a specific machine. Microprocessors were introduced in 1973, allowing programs similar to those on general-purpose digital computers to be stored and used for machine control. Simatic devices have input and output modules to connect with controlled machines. The programs on the Simatic devices respond in real time to inputs from sensors on the controlled machines, and send output signals to actuators on the machines that direct their subsequent operation. Depending on the device and its connection modules, signals may be a simple binary value (\\"high\\" or \\"low\\") or more complex. For example, a binary input going from a thermometer on a machine to a Simatic device might have the following meanings: * ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù signal: Temperature exceeded an operating limit * ‚ÄúLow‚Äù signal: Temperature is within expected limits Based on this input, and other factors, the program on the Simatic device might send a binary output signal to the same machine with the following meanings: * ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù signal: Run the motor * ‚ÄúLow‚Äù signal: Stop the motor More complex inputs, outputs, and calculations were also supported as the Simatic line developed. For example, the Simatic 505 could handle floating point quantities and trigonometric functions.  Product lines  Siemens has developed four product lines to date: * 1958: Simatic Version G * 1973: Simatic S3 * 1979: Simatic S5 * 1995: Simatic S7 = Simatic S5 = The S5 line was sold in 90U, 95U, 101U, 100U, 105, 110, 115,115U, 135U, and 155U chassis styles. The higher the number (except for the 101U), the more sophisticated and more expensive the system was. Within each chassis style, several CPUs were available, with varying speed, memory, and capabilities. Some systems provided redundant CPU operation for ultra-high-reliability control, as used in pharmaceutical manufacturing, for example. Each chassis consisted of a power supply, and a backplane with slots for the addition of various option boards. Available options included serial and Ethernet communications, digital input and output cards, analog signal processing boards, counter cards, and other specialized interface and function modules. = Simatic S7 = The first entries in the S7 line were the S7-200, S7-300 and S7-400 series. These models were later succeeded by the S7-1200 and S7-1500 series.  Software  Programs running on Simatic devices run in software environments created by Siemens. The environment varies by product line: * The Simatic S5 product line is programmed in STEP 5. * The Simatic S7 product line is programmed in STEP 7 (also known as TIA Portal) = Step 5 = The S5 product line was usually programmed with a PC based software programming tool called STEP 5. STEP 5 was used for programming, testing, and commissioning, and for documentation of programs for S5 PLCs. The original STEP 5 versions ran on the CP/M operating system. Later versions ran on MS- DOS, and then versions of Windows through Windows XP. The final version of STEP 5 was version 7.2 (upgradable to version 7.23 Hotfix 1 with patches). In addition to STEP 5, Siemens offered a proprietary State logic programming package called Graph5. Graph5 is a sequential programming language intended for use on machines that normally run through a series of discrete steps. It simulates a State machine on the S5 platform. Several third-party programming environments were released for the S5. Most closely emulated STEP 5, some adding macros and other minor enhancements, others functioning drastically differently from STEP 5. One allowed STEP 5 programs to be cross-compiled to and from the C programming language and BASIC. = Structured programming = STEP 5 allowed the creation of structured or unstructured programming, from simple AND/OR operations up to complex subroutines. A STEP 5 program may, therefore, contain thousands of statements. To maintain maximum transparency, STEP 5 offers a number of structuring facilities: * Block technique - A linear operation sequence is divided into sections and packed into individual blocks. * Segments - Within blocks, fine structuring is possible by programming subtasks in individual segments. * Comments - Both a complete program as well as individual blocks or segments and individual statements can be directly provided with comments. = Methods of representation = STEP 5 programs can be represented in three different ways: * Statement List (STL) - The program consists of a sequence of mnemonic codes of the commands executed one after another by the PLC. * Ladder Diagram (LAD) - Graphical representation of the automation task with symbols of the circuit diagram * Function Block Diagram (FBD) - Graphical representation of the automation task with symbols to DIN 40700/ DIN 40719. Absolute or symbolic designations can be used for operands with all three methods of representation. In LAD and FBD complex functions and function block calls can be entered via function keys. They are displayed on the screen as graphical symbols. There are several program editors, from either genuine Siemens, or from other suppliers. After Siemens discontinued support, other suppliers started to develop new STEP 5 version which can run on Windows XP, or Windows 7. = Blocks = Five types of blocks are available: * Organization blocks (OB) - for managing the control program * Programming blocks (PB) - contain the control program structured according to functional or process-oriented characteristics * Sequence blocks (SB) - for programming sequential controls * Function blocks (FB) - contain frequently occurring and particularly complex program parts * Data blocks (DB) - for storing data required for processing the control program. Some S5 PLCs also have block types FX (Extended Function Blocks), and DX(Extended Data Blocks); these are not distinct block types, but rather are another set of available blocks due to the CPU having more memory and addressing space. = Operations = STEP 5 differentiates between three types of operations: * Basic operations, (e.g. linking, saving, loading & transferring, counting, comparing, arithmetic operations, module operations) - These can be performed in all three representations. * Supplementary operations and complex functions, (e.g. substitution statements, testing functions, word-by-word logic operations, decrement/increment and jump functions.) - These can only be executed in STL. * System operations (direct access the operating system) - These can only be executed in STL.

Its name is origin of Thanon Nakhon Chai Si subdistrict of Dusit district, since it runs through the area. It starts from Rama VI road, passing Rama V, Pichai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Samsen roads, then cuts across Si Yan intersection, as far as ends at the Chao Phraya river at the Payap pier. The total distance is 3.185 km (round about one mi). Previously, it was named \\"Rachawat Road\\" (‡∏ñ‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏£). Its name was derived from a kind of Chinese porcelain with a fence-like pattern, which was a collector's item in those days. This road was built along with Dusit Palace in the year 1898 during King Chulalongkorn (Rama V)'s reign to use as a route to travel to the Sam Sen railway station more conveniently. Later on February 6, 1919, which corresponds to the King Vajiravudh (Rama VI)'s reign, he ordered that this road be renamed like the other roads that surround Dusit Palace to make it more universal. It is named in honour of Prince Chirapravati Voradej, Prince of Nakhon Chai Si, one of sons of King Chulalongkorn and half brother of King Vajiravudh, who considered as \\"Father of the Thai Army\\". Although it is short, Nakhon Chai Si road runs through important places, for example Rachawat bridge, a bridge over Khlong Prem Prachakon canal near the Dusit district office, Wat Amphawan, Wat Sawatwaree Simaram, Rachawat and Si Yan markets etc. In addition, the area that this road runs through is also known as \\"Rachawat\\" according its former name.

The main decoration is a depiction of the ambush of the Trojan Troilos by the Greek hero Achilles.  Decoration  Both sides of the neck of the amphora feature demi-Gorgons. The upper half of the main body depicts the ambush of the Trojan prince Troilos by the Greek hero Achilles, with the two sides depicting differing scenes of the event. One side has Achilles seizing Troilos outside the well-house, or, as Professor Percy Ure suggested, carrying him to the shrine. Achilles is shown fully armoured ‚Äì with ornate crested helmet, cuirass and greaves ‚Äì while Troilos appears almost completely undressed. The other side has two riders and an unmounted horse passing a fallen man. The lead rider next to the unmanned horse and above the fallen man is shown armoured with helmet and cuirass; the second rider and fallen man are clothed in a Thracian style, with soft caps and patterned cloaks. Ure believed this to be an illustration of Achilles‚Äôs attack on Troilos, with the following rider coming to Troilos‚Äôs aid. It has been suggested that the changes to the normal Greek telling of the story, for example the lack of a depiction of Polyxena, by the Etruscan decorator may be a muddling of the tale as it travelled to Etruria or even a deliberate change to better suit local tastes. The lower half of the amphora is decorated with wild animals: two male goats on their hind legs (as if rutting), two lions (one licking its paw) and a winged humanoid. The middle of the amphora features a band of palmettes, and the base a simple geometric triangle pattern. Both Ure and Professor Brian Sparkes noted that it is the rarity of the amphora opposed to its quality that marks it as an important example of the ‚ÄòPontic‚Äô type.  Acquisition  Ure acquired the amphora for the museum, then the Museum of Greek Archaeology, at auction in London in 1947. Then, as now, very little was known of the amphora‚Äôs provenance. It is thought to originate from the Etruscan city of Vulci, north-west of Rome ‚Äì Ure noted that the scene of Achilles‚Äô ambush of Troilos was a popular one for decorating tombs in the area. A poorly written description in the auction catalogue enabled Ure, after seeking advice from Sir John Beazley, to acquire it at a relatively economic price.  Current display  Detail of Achilles carrying Troilos The amphora is now on permanent display at the Ure Museum. It is one of the more prominent items in the museum‚Äôs large collection, and is a popular attraction for both scholars and members of the general public.

Hoel was the chairman of the company until 1945. Since its foundation Arctic Trading Co. was run through the NSIU, which from 1948 became the Norwegian Polar Institute.Report on the Activities of Norges Svalbard- og Ishavsunders√∏kelser 1936-1944, Norsk Polarinstitutt, Oslo 1945 The company helped to create a network of Norwegian hunting stations in East Greenland in the second half of the 1920s. Arctic Trading Co. provided free travel and equipment to the hunters and trappers manning the cabins, but they had to bring their own weapons and supplies. The company retained 40% of the gross value of the furs and 25% of the arctic char and salmon catch, leaving the rest to the trapper. Furs were mainly from the Arctic fox, in its white fox and blue fox varieties. Norwegian operations in East Greenland were concluded in 1959, but the company was not closed pending other possible business opportunities in the area.

Reptilian humanoids, or anthropomorphic reptiles, appear in folklore, fiction, and conspiracy theories.  In mythology  Many cultures have legends of creatures which are part human and part reptile. One of the first historical depictions of a reptilian humanoid was the Ancient Egyptian deity Sobek, who had the head of a crocodile. He was depicted with similar traits, such as being aggressive and animalistic. In South Asian and Southeast Asian mythology, the NƒÅga are semi-divine creatures which are half-human and half- serpent.  In folklore  Sightings of humanoid reptile cryptids are common in the Southern United States, where swamps are common. In the late 1980s, there were hundreds of supposed sightings of a \\"Lizard Man\\" in Bishopville, South Carolina.  In fiction  Anthropomorphic reptilian races or beings commonly appear in fantasy and science fiction. They can be based on various reptiles, like crocodiles, alligators, snakes, dinosaurs, and the fictional dragons. They are often depicted as powerful warriors, though their relative intelligence to humans varies - as with other anthropomorphic races, a greater resemblance to humans often denotes more \\"civilized\\" behavior. = Fantasy =  Games  A drawing of kobolds, reptilian humanoid beings that appear in Dungeons & Dragons. Examples of reptilian races in fantasy games are the Lizardfolk, Dragonborn and Kobolds of the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop role- playing game. The Dragonborn in particular - based on the Draconians of Dragonlance, which in that game were uniformly evil - were originally introduced in the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 supplement book Races of the Dragon, published by Wizards of the Coast in 2006. In 4th Edition, dragonborn are available as one of the core player character races in the Player's Handbook. The dragonborn were introduced to the core rules in an attempt to reflect contemporary trends in fantasy fiction and appeal to newer players. In addition, it reflected a perception among the game's designers that it should be possible to play dragon-like creatures in a game with \\"Dragons\\" in the title. Richard Baker, who helped design 4th Edition, noted that the introduction of dragonborn to the core rules allowed them to \\"grow the D&D; world by allowing the mix of characters to evolve in the new edition.\\" Jonathan Bolding of The Escapist noted that the inclusion of the dragonborn in the 5th edition Player's Handbook does \\"push the 'traditional D&D;' mold a bit, but this is a greatest hits of D&D; player races and powers from the last fifteen years of the game.\\" The lizardlike Argonian race also takes a prominent role in the fantasy video game franchise The Elder Scrolls. = Science fiction = In works of science fiction, aliens are often depicted as closely resembling animals, with reptilian aliens being no exception. An early appearance was in the story \\"The Lizard-Men of Buh-Lo\\" (1930) by Francis Flagg. Other examples include the Gorn from Star Trek, and the Dracs from the film Enemy Mine (1985). The television franchise V features the Visitors, a lizardlike alien race who disguise themselves as humans.

This took place during the 1808 to 1814 Spanish War of Independence, or Guerra de la Independencia Espa√±ola, part of the Peninsular War. She is known for inspiring the defenders of the city by single-handedly defeating an advancing French cavalry troop. Her story was popularised in a series of engravings entitled (Ruins of Zaragoza) published in 1812 and 1813. For her actions, she received a pension from Ferdinand VII of Spain and, at the centenary of the siege, her body was reinterred with honour. Biography √Ålvarez Barcel√≥ was born of humble origins in 1786, the daughter of Manuela Barlo and Manuela Barlo, both natives of Figueruelas. She may have been a native of Zaragoza, or born in Or√°n in Algeria and moved to the city later in life. However, by 1808 she was a resident of the city. Following the Dos de Mayo Uprising in Madrid, French and Polish forces under Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes were sent by Napoleon to put down the insurrection. On 15 June 1808, Lefebvre-Desnouettes arrived at Zaragoza ready to attack the city. Assault on Zaragoza by January Suchodolski The attack on the city was particularly brutal, being a combination of hand to hand combat on the streets and a siege to starve the citizens, which led to a huge human toll from disease as well as the conflict itself. The defenders, led by Jos√© de Palafox y Melci, were ill-trained compared to the French and Polish troops and fought a desperate fight. √Ålvarez Barcel√≥ helped organise supplies and munitions for the citizens and defenders. In addition to this crucial work, while operating near the Puerta del Carmen, she found herself in grave danger. Suddenly surrounded by French cavalry, rather than fleeing, she picked up a discarded musket and started firing. The French, surprised by the fierceness of this Spanish peasant and her skill with the weapon, retreated. Her actions inspired the defending troops and the French forces were repulsed. She subsequently also participated in the second siege of Zaragoza and once again her personality, as well as her military prowess, inspired the people of Zaragoza, who considered her a hero. Once the city was occupied by the French forces, she moved with her parents to Caba√±as de Ebro. After the conflict, she married a wealthy farmer in 1814 and lived the rest of her life in obscurity, dying a widow at the age of 60 on 29 April 1846. In recognition of her action, √Ålvarez Barcel√≥ was awarded the (Shield of Distinction) and (Shield of a Defender of the Fatherland), along with a pension from Ferdinand VII of Spain conferred on 30 May 1815. Legacy Despite the fact that the Spanish were ultimately defeated at Zaragoza, √Ålvarez Barcel√≥, along with other heroines of the conflict like Agustina de Arag√≥n, became an important national icon. Her image was popularised in the series of engravings by Juan G√°lvez and Fernando Brambila entitled (Ruins of Zaragoza) published in C√°diz in 1812 and 1813. A portrait by Marcelino de Unceta from 1875 was also displayed in Zaragoza. In 1908, at the centennial of the siege, her body was re-interred in honour in the Chapel of the Anunciaci√≥n del Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora del Portillo and a road was named after her.

Originally built on speculation as a blockade runner for the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, she was not sold before the war ended and a shipowner in the Netherlands instead purchased the vessel. The ship's owner renamed the ship Heinrich Heister, though he made no use of her. In 1870, following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, the North German Navy was in search of vessels to augment its fleet and acquired Heinrich Heister, transferred her to Emden, briefly renaming her Emden to obscure the ship's movements, before being converted into an armed aviso with her intended name, Falke. Her wartime service was cut short by an accidental ramming by the ironclad warship , sending Falke into dock for repairs. She was next commissioned in 1875; she spent the next six years in active service either with the main fleet, as a tender, or as a fishery protection ship, being decommissioned toward the end of each year for the winter. She had repeated problems with her propulsion system during this period, and in 1879, she was involved in experiments with electrical lighting, making her the first German warship to be equipped with a searchlight. Laid up from 1882 through 1885, she was recommissioned in early 1886 for fishery protection duties, a role she filled for the next three years. She left service for the last time in late 1888, was struck from the naval register in 1890, and sold for scrap in 1892. Design Falke was requisitioned during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 as what was by then the North German Federal Navy sought to acquire ships with which it could defend the North German Confederation's coast in the North and Baltic Seas. Falke was among four merchant ships purchased by the navy, along with the paddle steamer and the HAPAG passenger liners Cuxhaven and Helgoland. =Characteristics= Falke was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of over the hull and over the wheel boxes for the paddle wheels. Her draft was forward and aft. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The hull was constructed with transverse iron frames and was divided into six watertight compartments. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. The ship's crew consisted of six officers and eighty-four enlisted men. She carried four small boats of unrecorded type. Falke was a good sea boat, but was difficult to turn. She lost little speed in a head sea, though a beam sea caused considerable loss of speed. To supplement her steam engine, she carried a schooner rig, but it contributed little to her performance. These problems were typical of paddle steamers. Falkes propulsion system consisted of one vertical, oscillating 2-cylinder marine steam engine that drove a pair of paddle wheels located amidships. The wheels were in diameter, with ten paddles each. Steam for the engine was provided by two coal-fired trunk boilers fitted with superheaters. The engine and boilers were placed in a combined engine/boiler room, and the boilers were each ducted into their own funnel. The system was rated at 300 nominal horsepower for a top speed of . In service, she was capable of and a top speed of . She could carry up to of coal, which allowed a cruising radius of at a speed of 12 knots. The ship was armed with a pair of 23-caliber breechloading hoop guns that were supplied with 670 shells. The guns had a range of . Later in her career, she received five Hotchkiss revolver cannons. Service history The turret ship rammed Falke and ended her wartime service in 1870 Falke was originally built in 1865 as a speculative venture by Henderson, Coulborn and Company of Renfrew, Scotland. Her builders intended to sell her to the Confederate States of America for use as a blockade runner during the American Civil War, but the war ended before the vessel could be sold. She was instead sold to a shipowner in Rotterdam, renamed Heinrich Heister, and laid up there. In late August 1870, shortly after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Korvettenkapit√§n (KK‚ÄîCorvette captain) Franz von Waldersee was sent to secure fast steamships built abroad. German shipyards would not be able to complete vessels in time for use during the war, so vessels from neutral countries would have to be acquired. The North German Federal Navy planned to use the vessels as scouts for boats armed with towed torpedoes. Waldersee initially searched in Britain but could not find a suitable ship, though he learned of Heinrich Heisters presence in Rotterdam. Waldersee, under the name John Smith and stating himself to be from Britain, purchased the vessel on 25 August. Waldersee hired a crew of Dutch seamen and declared his destination to be London, but after leaving Rotterdam, he ordered the crew to instead take the ship to Delfzijl, stating that his contractors wanted the ship to proceed there. From there, he took the ship to the mouth of the Ems river on 30 August, where he encountered a gunboat; after Waldersee explained the situation, the gunboat escorted Heinrich Heister upriver to Emden. They arrived there on 2 September, where the Dutch crew was sent home. The ship was temporarily renamed Emden to obscure the movement of the vessel and commissioned on 4 September so she could be transferred to the main naval base at Wilhelmshaven. There, she would be converted into a warship and fitted with guns. On 12 September, an order from the high command renamed her Falke. Conversion work was completed and on 4 October she was recommissioned. After returning to service, still under Waldersee's command, Falke conducted sea trials before embarking on 12 October on a sortie to attack the French blockade squadron in company with the ironclad turret ship . The operation ended in near disaster for Falke when Arminius accidentally rammed her while the vessels were leaving Jade Bay. Falke was badly damaged below the waterline; in a sinking condition, she returned to port with great difficulty. The only drydock in Wilhelmshaven was occupied until January 1871, preventing Falke from being repaired until then. After repairs were completed, Falke remained out of service for the next four years. Sketch of the German fleet conducting maneuvers Falke was recommissioned on 19 May 1875 for service as an aviso; by this time, experience with towed torpedoes had demonstrated to the German naval command that they were not effective weapons, and her originally envisioned role had been abandoned. She served with the ironclad training squadron from 3 June to the end of September. During this period, the squadron held maneuvers off Sassnitz that were observed by Kaiser Wilhelm I, during which Falke acted as a simulated enemy vessel. She was decommissioned for the year on 10 October in Wilhelmshaven. She spent 1876 out of service, but was recommissioned on 7 May 1877 for another year with the ironclad training squadron. She was to have left for the eastern Mediterranean Sea, but after getting underway she broke a connecting rod, forcing her to return to port for repairs. AG Weser of Bremen quickly manufactured a replacement rod and completed the repair within 24 hours, allowing Falke to get underway on 3 June, meeting the rest of the squadron in Gibraltar ten days later. She suffered another breakdown on the way back to Germany and had to stop in Malta for repairs. She arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 25 October and was decommissioned there on 5 November. While out of service, she received new boilers and her engine was thoroughly overhauled. On 27 May 1878, Falke was recommissioned once again to serve with the ironclad squadron for another Mediterranean cruise. Her engines broke down again upon getting underway on 29 May, forcing repairs that lasted another two days. Before she could depart on 31 May, she received word of the accidental sinking of the ironclad in a collision with the ironclad off Folkestone, Britain, earlier that day. She joined the squadron in Portsmouth, Britain, where she embarked survivors of the sinking and carried them to Wilhelmshaven on 6 June. Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Carl Ferdinand Batsch, the squadron commander, and his staff were also ordered to return aboard Falke for an inquiry into the accident. The accident cancelled the planned training cruise and Falke remained in commission only through 17 July, during which time she served as a fishery protection ship in the North Sea. The following year, Falke returned to commission on 1 April to serve as a tender for the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station). She was involved in experiments with electrical lights aboard warships, and she was the first German warship to be fitted with a searchlight. From 26 July to 28 August, she carried Prince Friedrich Karl to visit King Oscar II of Sweden‚ÄìNorway. From 1880 to 1881, Falke served in the same capacities as she had in the two previous years, primarily as a tender for the Marinestation. Kapit√§nleutnant (Lieutenant Captain) Friedrich von Baudissin served as the ship's commander from April to August 1881. During this period, on 26 April, following an explosion aboard the artillery school ship in the Schillig roadstead, Falke ferried wounded crewmen from the ship to Wilhelmshaven. She was sent to western Scotland on 7 July to assist the HAPAG steamer that was in distress, though by the time Falke arrived, a British steamer had come to Vandalias aid. She was decommissioned for the year on 25 August, remaining out of service for the next two years. In 1883, the ship underwent major repairs, followed by limited sea trials from 2 to 20 October, before being decommissioned again. Falke was recommissioned on 24 March 1886 for fishery protection duty; she also served as a training ship for engineers. Decommissioned for the year on 30 September, she was recommissioned on 29 March 1887, once again to patrol German territorial waters. On 17 May, she stopped the British fishing boat Lady Goodwill for violating German waters. In 1888, Falke conducted a series of cruises in the North and Baltic Seas for members of the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff). Decommissioned for the last time in late 1888, she was struck from the naval register on 18 November 1890 and sold for scrap in November 1892, thereafter being broken up.

Philosophers who took part included Eugen D√ºhring, Eduard von Hartmann, neo-Kantians, Agnes Taubert, Olga Pl√ºmacher and critics of von Hartmann. The controversy first arose as a response to Arthur Schopenhauer's growing posthumous public recognition in the 1860s. This led to the publication of a wide array of criticisms, attacking his pessimism. The publication of Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious, in 1869, which reaffirmed and further developed Schopenhauer's doctrine, reinvigorated the controversy. He published a great number of articles and four books in response to his critics, throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Agnes Taubert (Hartmann's wife) published Der Pessimismus und seine Gegner, in 1873, in response to criticism of her husband, which had a strong influence on the controversy.

Superior Court (\\"Dynamex\\"). In that case, the court held that most workers are employees, ought to be classified as such, and the burden of proof for classifying individuals as independent contractors belongs to the hiring entity. AB 5 entitles workers classified as employees to greater labor protections, such as minimum wage laws, sick leave, and unemployment and workers' compensation benefits, which do not apply to independent contractors. Concerns over employee misclassification, especially in the gig economy, drove support for the bill, but it remains divisive. The law codifies and expands the scope of the ABC test. The test includes a three-prong assessment to determine if a worker was misclassified: (A) that the individual is free from direction and control applicable both under the contract for the performance of service and in fact; (B) that the service is performed outside the usual course of business of the employer; and (C) that the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed. In response to the passage of AB 5, several industries began to lobby Sacramento for exemptions. Uber and Lyft made one such attempt on behalf of the rideshare industry, but their efforts were denied. The industries that were granted exemptions tended to have the following characteristics: * the independent contractors had the wherewithal to set or negotiate their own prices * the independent contractors had access to direct communication with customers * the independent contractors earned at least twice the minimum wage Uber and Lyft both continued their \\"business as usual\\" and refused to reclassify their drivers as employees, which potentially exposes the gig-work companies to litigation from state agencies. Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash have pledged to spend $30 million each on a 2020 ballot initiative to reverse AB 5. This initiative is on the ballot for the 2020 California elections as Proposition 22, and if it passes, then rideshare and delivery drivers will be classified as independent contractors.  Provisions and history  On April 30, 2018, the Supreme Court of California ruled in Dynamex to impose stricter requirements for employee classification. It created a 3-part test to determine whether an employee could be classified as a contractor rather than an employee, commonly known as the \\"ABC\\" test, replacing, for wage order claims,(Garcia v. Border Transportation Group, LLC (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 558 [239 Cal.Rptr.3d 360].) a previous 11-point standard set in S.G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations (\\"Borello\\") in 1989 (the Borello test). The bill, introduced in December 2018, places the ruling on a statutory footing by inserting ¬ß2750.3 to the California Labor Code, and, as a general rule, puts the burden of proof on employers to show that a worker is properly classified as an independent contractor where all three of the following conditions are met: * the worker is free from the control and direction of the hirer in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of such work and in fact * the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business * the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed for the hiring entityLabor Code 2750.3(a) This test is excluded in certain specified cases, where Borello will continue to apply. This is declared without qualification for a specified list of occupations,Labor Code 2750.3(b) and, for other stated professional, B2B and construction services, respectively, separate lists of conditions must also be fully applicable in order to establish that a worker is an independent contractor.Labor Code 2750.3(c), (e)‚Äì(f) Real estate licensees and repossession agencies were declared to be governed by the California Business and Professions Code instead.Labor Code 2750.3(d) The law also gives cities in the state the right to sue companies for violating the law, where previously they could not. The California Attorney General's office and local prosecutors can also sue companies. Proponents of the bill said it would give workers previously classified as contractors minimum wage, overtime, sick leave, unemployment and other benefits, and prevent the state from losing $8 billion from payroll taxes that independent contractors and companies who use them do not pay and social benefits required due to lower pay. Opponents said it would increase labor costs by up to 30%, create higher costs for customers and reduced service, and reduce flexibility for workers. After discussions and amendments to the law, which primarily included exceptions for certain professions, the bill first passed the Assembly in May 2019. In August 2019, as the bill neared passage, gig economy companies Uber and Lyft also proposed a negotiated $21 minimum wage but to keep employees as independent contractors as an exception. The proposals were not accepted by the legislature. Other amendments and exceptions were made, primarily to exclude particular professions. The bill drew national attention, including the support of major Democratic Party 2020 presidential candidates. After its final passage in the legislature, on September 11, 2019, Uber and Lyft both said they had no plans to reclassify workers as employees, with Uber's Chief Legal Officer Tony West saying \\"Just because the test is hard doesn‚Äôt mean we won‚Äôt be able to pass it. We continue to believe that drivers are properly classified as independent.\\" In response to the implementation of the law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated its decision in Vazquez v. Jan-Pro, which impacts California franchise law and California independent contractor law, by making it unclear that if a franchisor licenses its trademark to a franchisee whether the franchisor incurs the liabilities of an employer. On December 16, 2019, California Labor and Workforce Development Agency developed guidanceEmployment Status Portal to provide resources and information to workers and employers on AB 5. AB 5 was introduced by California assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez and endorsed by Governor Gavin Newsom. It was approved by the California State Senate 29‚Äì11 on a party-line vote, by the Assembly 56‚Äì15, and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019. It took effect January 1, 2020.  Exemptions  Some professions are exempt from AB 5, including doctors, dentists, psychologists, insurance agents, stockbrokers, lawyers, accountants, engineers, and real estate agents, as they are seen to generally directly work with and set their prices to customers. Newspaper delivery workers will be given an extra year before compliance. Legal challenges In November 2019, the California Trucking Association, representing about 70,000 truck drivers in the state, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, challenging both the California Supreme Court Dynamex ruling and AB 5. The Association argues that many of the represented drivers had opted to be independent contractors after having been employeed drivers, as this allows them to set their own schedules and otherwise profit from owning their own vehicle. Enforcement of AB 5 would force them to be treated as employees and lose these benefits, the Association argued. On December 17, 2019, the American Society of Journalists and Authors and the National Press Photographers Association filed suit in United States District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division claiming the law unconstitutionally singled out freelance journalists by limiting the amount of work they can produce for any single publisher, unlike any other job category listed as \\"professional services\\". Uber and Postmates filed a similar suit at the end of December 2019, challenging that the law denies equal protection due to the what types of jobs were exempted or not.  Reception and impact  Organizers expected AB 5 to lead to the growth of labor unions.https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/10/what- californias-ab-5-means-apps-like-uber-lyft/2278936001/ = On the music industry = The Recording Academy expressed concerns that AB 5 would negatively impact gigging musicians, and stated that it is lobbying California lawmakers to inform them about \\"the impact of such legislation\\". Director of San Jose Jazz Brendan Rawson argues that because AB 5 requires any music venue to designate members of an act performing there even once as official employees of the venue itself, events such as music festivals will be severely and unnecessarily burdened. The only way around this, Rawson says, is for musicians to incorporate themselves. Rawson points out that this also extends beyond the musicians themselves, citing temporary hiring of SJPD officers for the San Jose Jazz's Summer Fest, all of whom must now be added as San Jose Jazz employees. The Lake Tahoe Music Festival announced it is shutting down after 40 years due to AB 5. =On freelance journalism= Forbes criticized the bill's limits on freelance journalism and is advocating for California to change it. Assemblywoman Gonzalez acknowledged that some freelance journalists lost substantial income.https://twitter.com/LorenaSGonzalez/status/1206962386055221253?s=20 Several days prior, in response to potential job losses resulting from the bill, Gonzalez tweeted, \\"These were never good jobs. No one has ever suggested that, even freelancers. We will continue to work on this next year.\\" In December 2019 Vox Media ended contracts with about 200 freelance sports writers and editors who wrote for the blog network SB Nation, and announced it would replace them with 20 new part-time and full-time employees. The company had carried stories supportive of AB 5.https://www.vox.com/2019/9/11/20851034/california-ab-5-workers-labor-unions Assemblywoman Gonzalez criticized Vox, referring to them as ‚Äúvultures‚Äù in connection with their previous use of freelance writers. Freelance journalists who live in California fear that it will be harder to get work, because companies will not want to deal with the additional paperwork and legal liabilities of AB 5 and will instead hire someone from another state. =On rideshare drivers= In response to the new law, Uber has made several changes to its app for drivers in California, such as allowing drivers to see destinations in advance, and removing penalties for rejecting rides. It has also started testing a new feature that allows drivers to set their own rates, in 10% increments, with the passenger seeing the lowest fare accepted by an available driver, and drivers seeing how long they will likely wait to get dispatched based on their chosen rate.  Enforcement actions  In May 2020, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued Uber and Lyft, alleging the ride-hailing companies have misclassified their drivers as contractors in violation of a new state law that went into effect this year. City attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego have joined Becerra in the lawsuit. The suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleges Uber and Lyft have denied their workers key benefits and protections by classifying drivers as contractors rather than employees. The plaintiffs claim the decision denied workers the right to minimum wage and overtime pay, reimbursement for business-related expenses, access to unemployment and disability insurance as well as paid sick leave. California Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman issued his ruling on August 10, 2020, stating that Uber and Lyft must treat their drivers as employees under AB-5, as their work in the context of the \\"ABC test\\" was not outside the usual course of their business, nor was a \\"multi-sided platform\\" as Uber and Lyft had argued but simply transportation companies that fell within AB-5's provisions. Both Uber and Lyft have stated their plan to appeal the ruling as well as seek an injunction to stay the order until the appeal is complete.

This case shocked the 1970s society in Bragan√ßa Paulista.  Early life  Sebasti√£o Ant√¥nio de Oliveira's date and place of birth is uncertain. According to a report in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, he was born in Tuiuti on October 7, 1915, while the magazine O Cruzeiro names the city as Ampar and the year as 1916. Since childhood, he experienced psychiatric problems that increased over the years. He married in 1938, and had several children. In the 1950s, his mental health problems got worse.  First wave of crimes  In 1953, Sebasti√£o was in Atibaia when he lured an 8-year-old boy and raped him, leaving the child almost dead. Later that year, another child was found dead with signs of rape in the Bragan√ßa region. After being denounced, he was arrested and sentenced to prison at the Carandiru Penitentiary. Psychiatric examinations requested by the court led to his transfer at the Franco da Rocha Penal Hospital for treatment. Due to his good behavior, he was transferred to the Juqueri Psychiatric Hospital in 1958. The following year, he fled Juqueri and wandered around until he settled in S√£o Paulo. There, he lived in the Tatuap√© neighborhood with his wife and daughter. On July 10, 1959, Sebasti√£o kidnapped his daughter and fled. His wife warned the authorities, who searched S√£o Paulo and the surrounding countryside because of De Oliveira's history. The next day, after raping her, Sebasti√£o abandoned his daughter at the Mogi-Mirim Road in Campinas and fled again. In 1963, he was charged with the rape of another minor and arrested in Adamantina, and was again sent to Franco da Rocha Penal Hospital. In 1969, a medical report classified him as a \\"pure bio-criminal with a sexopathic specialty\\" and Sebasti√£o was transferred to the Taubat√© Custody Hospital, where he remained until February 24, 1973, when he was released under surveillance. The following year, he roamed and begged around the Bragan√ßa Paulista region until he settled in Bragan√ßa in mid-1974.  Second wave of crimes  In December 1974, Sebasti√£o kidnapped, raped and murdered 6-year-old Maria Janete (on the 26th) and 8-year-old Valdir (on the 29th), also attempting to attack 4 other children between those dates. The Civil Police interrogated the ones that escaped the maniac and received a description of the suspect. While searching for him, two more children, sisters Ana Aparecida (6) and Ros√¢ngela (7) disappeared. With the news of their disappearance, the entire of city of Bragan√ßa started panicking, with parents preventing children from playing in the streets, going to school, etc. After a 22-day manhunt, Sebasti√£o was arrested in Amparo. He was driven to Bragan√ßa, where he confessed to the 4 murders and took the investigators to the place where he had left the bodies of the missing sisters.  Imprisonment and death  The news of the arrest echoed through Bragan√ßa Paulista, so crowds began surrounding the police station in order to lynch the so-called \\"Monster of Bragan√ßa\\". The authorities had to carry out a transfer operation to Campinas, with more than 50 armed policemen escorting Sebasti√£o to the Campinas Prison. While awainting trial there, he received death threats from other detainees, and was then transferred to Atibaia. After the court responded to a request from his defense lawyer, De Oliveira was transferred for a third time to the Franco da Rocha Penal Hospital. Subsequently, the presiding judge of the case, Dr. Jo√£o Batista Lopes, asked three times in 1975 for a mental assessment to decide whether the defendant should be tried. For unknown reasons, the assessment was not carried out that year, and instead rescheduled for early 1976. On January 7, 1976, Sebasti√£o was found hanging in his cell.  In popular culture  In Bragan√ßa, the tombs of the 4 children located in the Saudade Municipal Cemetery became a popular pilgrimage point. Some people attribute miracles to the children and leave offerings in thanks for the graces they received.journalismofaat.wordpress.com/2016/11/21/population-go- the-municipal-cemeterio-and-pay-honestyles/ References Category:Brazilian serial killers Category:1976 deaths Category:1915 births Category:Male serial killers Category:Serial killers who committed suicide in prison custody Category:Brazilian rapists Category:People convicted of child sexual abuse Category:People convicted of murder by Brazil Category:Suicides by hanging in Brazil Category:People from S√£o Paulo Category:Pages with unreviewed translations ","title":"Sebasti√£o Ant√¥nio de Oliveira"},{"id":"61750934","text":"The Day of the Canary Islands () is celebrated annually on .

The estate was founded by Christoffer Lindenov and remained in the hands of the Lindenoc family for almost one hundred years. It was later owned by the Thott/Reedtz-Thott family between 1732 and 1923, from 1705 as part of the Barony of Gavn√∏. The current main building is from 1830. Lindersvold is now owned by Den selvejende institution F√¶lleseje and operated as a private primary school for children with special challenges under the name Heldagsskolen Lindersvold. History =1593‚Äì1672: Lindenov family= Lindersvold was established by Christoffer Clausen Lindenov (died 1593) and his wife Sophie Hartvigsdatter Pless (died 1602) from land that had until then belonged to the villages of Akselhoved and Hyllingeskov. The estate is first mentioned in 1580. Christoffer Clausen Lindenov was already lensmand of Koldinghus and Hindsgavl and therefore spent little time on his estate at Faxe. It is unclear who owned the estate after Lindenov's death in 1593. Godske Lindenov, who was Admiral and Head of Bremerholm, acquired Lindersvold in 1606. He expanded the estate through the acquisition of more land, for instance the village of Axelhoved with eight farms and eight houses. Lindersvold was after his death passed first to his widow and then to his son. Christoffer Godskesen Lindenov succeeded his father as Head of Bremerholm with rank of Admiral in 1645. In 1657, he fell out of favour at the Court when he was strongly opposed to the war against Sweden. After being accused of embezzlement, in February 1757, he was fired and expelled from the court by Frederick III. In February 1658, during the Assault on Copenhagen, he was put in charge of the defence of Christianshavn. The buildings on the Lindersvold estate were destroyed by Swedish troops during the wars in 1657‚Äì58 and 1658‚Äì1660. Lindenov constructed a new two-storey, half-timbered main building in 1671. =1672‚Äì1732: Urne, von Schildern and Krabbe= In 1672, Lindenov sold Lindersvold to his son-in-law, Axel Urne. Just one year later, Urne sold Lindersvold to his brother-in-law, Rabe von Schildern, who was married to Merete Sophie Urne. She managed Lindersvold with great skill after her husband's death in 1680 and for the next 44 years. She also increased the size of the estate through barters or the acquisition of more land. =Thott family= Otto Thott After Merete Sophie Urne's death, in 1724, Lindersvold passed to her daughter Hedvig Sophie von Schildern Lindersvold. In 1728 she sold it to Kirstine Marie Krabbe, the widow of Ulrik Kruse. Their daughter married Otto Thott. It was later part of Stamhuset Yhott-Redtz and the Barony of Gavn√∏. The estate was from 1871 to 1897 leased by Ingo Marius Friis. He was a pioneer of cattle breeding in Denmark and in 1884 founded the Association for the Improvement of Cattle Breeding in the Parish of Roholte. =1923-present: Later history= One of the first smallholdings built at Lindersvold in 1922 In 1821, the Barony of Gavn√∏ was dissolved as a result of the lensafl√∏sningslov of 1919. In 1923, Lindersvold was acquired by John Petersen. He sold off most of the land for smallholdings. His widow sold the main building and tremaining land to the Christmas Stamp Committee. Lindersvold was then operated as the Christmas Stamp Foundation's fourth Christmas Stamp Home until 1959. It was from 1946 headed by Poul Billgren. A drawing of the main building featured on the foundation's official 1934 Christmas stamp. It was printed in 16.5 copies and raised DKK 261,609.

A Compton generator or Compton tube is an apparatus for experiment to demonstrate the Earth's rotation, similar to the Foucault pendulum and to gyroscope devices.  Explanation of apparatus  Constraction of Compton generator. A Compton generator is a circular hollow glass ring tube shaped like a doughnut, the inside of which is filled with water. If the ring lies flat on the table, the water in the ring is stationary, and it is then turned over by rotating itself 180 degree around a diameter, such that it again lies flat on the table surface, which is horizontal. The result of the experiment is that the water moves with a certain constant drift velocity around the tube after the doughnut has been rotated. If there were no friction with the walls, the water would continue to circulate indefinitely. The ring used in the initial experiment was made of one inch brass tubing bent into a circle eighteen inches in diameter, where the windows were placed the tube was constricted to a diameter of about three eights of an inch. Compton used small droplets of coal oil mixed in the water to measure the drift velocity under a microscope.  Analysis  Assume the diameter of the glass tube is much smaller than the diameter of the ring, and R is the radius of the ring, \\\\omega is the Earth rotation rate and \\\\lambda is the latitude. Initially the ring is horizontal and the water is stationary. Second the ring is then quickly rotated by 180¬∞ around its East-West diameter and stopped, such that it again lies flat on the table surface, which is horizontal. At this time, the velocity v_{th} of the water in the tube is given by v_{th} = 2 \\\\omega R \\\\sin \\\\lambda Note that a rotation from the vertical to the vertical position produces the velocity v_{tv} of the water in the tube is given by v_{tv} = 2 \\\\omega R \\\\cos \\\\lambda  Experimental verification  Compton used this measured drift velocity to determine his latitude to within 3% accuracy.

Within minutes of the first plane hitting the first tower, multiple fireboats from the New York City Fire Department rushed the scene. The United States Coast Guard coordinated a large convoy of merchant ships, tugboats, and ferries to evacuate the stranded and injured victims. More than 150 different vessels and 600 sailors helped evacuate victims and delivered supplies in the days following the attacks. According to the Commandant of the Coast Guard James Loy, the mass evacuation of more than 500,000 civilians following the attacks \\"moved more people from the island than the 1940 evacuation of Allied troops from France.\\"  Background  Following the second plane crash into South Tower, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed all of the bridges and tunnels under their jurisdiction. The MTA Bridges and Tunnels also closed their crossings into Manhattan for at least a day after the attacks. As a result, many people were either stranded in Lower Manhattan or tried to evacuate via East Rivers crossings, like the Brooklyn Bridge. The United States Coast Guard New York Sector closed the New York Harbor to all ship movements. After the collapse of the South Tower, many evacuees began to arrive at the Lower Hudson River piers to try and evacuate.  Response  = Coast Guard and government response = The United States Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service and the Harbor Unit of the New York Police Department put out an emergency radio calls to all nearby vessels to help evacuate from Battery Park. In addition to vessel coordination, the Coast Guard assisted at the Fresh Kills Landfill and Lower Manhattan with human remain and property recovery operations. Some U.S. Coast Guard ships that responded included cutters USCGC Katherine Walker and USCGC Tahoma. Multiple fireboats of the New York City Fire Department, including John J. Harvey and Fire Fighter, were among the first boats on the scene and provided most of the firefighting activities from the water. = Civilian response = Multiple ferry lines, including the Staten Island Ferry and SeaStreak, helped in the evacuation. A variety of vessels including tugboats and merchant ships in the New York metropolitan area responded to the emergency calls for evacuations. = Aftermath = Multiple news outlets praised the maritime coordination and evacuation. Norman Mineta, the Secretary of Transportation in a hearing in front of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States said the response was the \\"largest maritime evacuation conducted in the history of the United States\\". In 2011, a documentary called Boatlift: An Untold Tale of 9/11 Resilience was released detailing the stories of boat crews responding to the evacuations. It was narrated by Tom Hanks.

The temple no longer exists, but the temple grounds were designated as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government in 2001. Overview The site is located at an altitude of 340 meters in the ≈åchiwa Pass which connects the city of Kosai in Shizuoka Prefecture with the city of Toyokawa in Aichi Prefecture, and overlooks Lake Hamana. The area is maintained as part of a hiking course today. It is approximately one hour 45 minutes on foot from Tenry≈´ Hamanako Line Chibata Station. The presence of ruins in the ≈åchiwa Pass was known for many years; however, there was no mention of any settlement in literature, and the nature of these ruins was unknown. Starting in 1989, the Kosai City Board of Education conducted excavation surveys for seven years, discovering the foundation of twelve buildings, remnants of a pond with gardens. and monumental gate, built in two terraces on the hillside. Of these building, five were clearly Buddhist temple structures, the largest of which was a 7x4 bay hall, with dimensions of 16 x 11 meters. Numerous pottery and ceramic shards were uncovered, including 445 examples with ink-painted inscriptions, from which the site could be dated from the 8th century through the end of the 11th century. From the inscriptions, it appears that this was either a Tendai or Shingon temple. A small chapel was erected on top of the earlier ruins in the latter half of the 12th century. The site has been backfilled, and there are no ruins visible today.

She lived under conditions of slavery after being kidnapped at the age of seven and sent to Ghanaian sanctuary where Trokosi, or wife of the gods, was a secular practice that sends young women to forced labor to redeem the sins of their relatives. When she was only seven-years-old, Brigitte was kidnapped and taken to a Ghanaian sanctuary to pay for the adultery crime committed by her uncle, according to the Trojan tradition. This practice had survived for more than 300 years and was finally illegalized in Ghana in 1998, although it was continued and no priest was ever tried. Till this day, certain communities in Ghana, Benin, and Togo still practice Trokosi. The year in which Brigitte entered the sanctuary, the country had 5,000 women and girls in Trokosi . In 1997, the 60-minute US program of the CBS chain showed the world the conditions in which Brigitte lived through a documentary titled My Stolen Childhood. With the help of the NGO International Needs, Kenneth Perenyi decided to go to Ghana in order to release her. He was able to release, adopt, and send her to the United States, where she spent the next 13 years. About 20 years after being released, Brigitte returned to Togo to meet her biological family.

Origins Led by Issam Al-Arab, the party was formed through a split from the Union of Working People's Forces in October 1974. Apart from Al-Arab, co-founders of the group included Fouad Itani and Samih Hamada. In founding the new party, Al-Arab condemned the support of the Union of Working People's Forces leadership to the new Egyptian president Anwar Sadat. Al-Arab argued that the Egyptian government under Sadat had abandoned Nasserism. The party joined the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), whilst its mother party Union of Working People's Forces parted ways with the LNM as it sided with the Syrian government. Military structure and organization Like other Lebanese Nasserist parties, the UWPF-CM had its own militia, the Nasser's Forces (Arabic: ŸÇŸàÿßÿ™ ŸÜÿßÿµÿ±  Quwwat an-Nasir) or Forces de Nasser in French, whose formation was announced on April 15, 1975.Almodon.

The UWPF-CM in the Lebanese Civil War Although small in size, the Nasser's Forces took part in fighting in Beirut, in the Battle of the Hotels, Chyah, on the Ras Nabi-Sodeco axis, at Khandak El Ghamik as well as in combats in Mount Lebanon (Aley, Qmatiyeh and Bdadoun). However, relations with its LNM coalition partners were strained to the point of the Nasser's Forces battling rival Nasserite parties such as the Al-Mourabitoun in November 1975 over control of the Karantina district in East Beirut.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 36. The party underwent a split in 1978. In an extraordinary congress there was a dispute between Al-Arab, who argued in favour of alliance with the governments of Iraq and Libya, and his opponents led by Hassan Qubaisi. On July 23, 1978 Al-Arab was declared expelled from the party and Qubaisi was named new General Secretary of the party. The Nasser's Forces continued confronting the Christian Lebanese Front right-wing militias between 1978 and 1982. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the departure of PLO, the Nasser Forces went underground and supposedly converted itself into a clandestine resistance group.

It is characterized by its yellow, thick-walled hyphae and biseriate sterigmata. The fungus produces citrinin and 5 unique depsipeptides, Aspergillicins A-E. History and taxonomy The fungus was originally isolated by van Tieghem in 1877 from a soil sample in Java, where it was named Sterigmatocystis carnea. The epithet carnea was derived from the Latin meaning \\"flesh coloured\\". The fungus was later described by Sartory, Sartory and Meyer in 1930 under the probable synonym Sterigmatocystis albo- rosea, as they erroneously believed it to be a new species. However, the genus Sterigmatocystis is now obsolete. In 1933, the fungus was renamed Aspergillus carneus by Blochwitz, because he believed that van Tieghem's initial description was inadequate. Thus, although some authors have erroneously attributed it to van Tieghem, the epithet carneus that is currently in use was originally coined by Blochwitz. The classification of A. carneus in section Terrei or section Flavipedes (2 closely related groups belonging to the Aspergillus subgenus Terrei) has been contested. Classifications were originally based on morphological examination. A. carneus was first placed in section Terrei, along with Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nivea, by Thom and Raper (1945) due to its transparent aleurioconidia. In 1965, A. carneus was reclassified to Aspergillus section Flavipedes, along with A. flavipes and A. nivea, by Raper and Fennell because its conidial heads were less columnar than those of A. terreus and its unique thick-walled, yellow hyphae. This taxonomic debate was addressed using modern molecular genetic techniques as they became available. In 2000, sequencing of the D1/D2 region of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene indicated that Thom and Raper's original classification (1945) of A. carneus in Aspergillus section Terrei was likely correct. However, Varga et al. (2005) re-examined 3 isolates of A. carneus from the USA and Haiti by sequencing the fungus' internal transcribed spacer gene region and conducting a random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Their work revealed that A. flavipes, A. terreus and A. carneus species were equally related, rendering the distinction between sections Terrei and Flavipedes obsolete. They recommended that both sections be merged, pending further confirmatory genetic analyses. However, as of 2016, A. carneus continues to be considered a member of section Terrei, along with 15 other members of the genus Aspergillus. Growth and physiology  Growth of A. carneus is moderate from 24-26 ¬∞C and optimal from 41-42 ¬∞C. The fungus cannot grow at temperatures below 6-7 ¬∞C or above 46-48 ¬∞C. Colonies of A. carneus grow rapidly, reaching a diameter of 4‚Äì5 cm in 2 weeks on Czapek medium. Normal growth also occurs on media containing 1% dextrane, and growth is resistant to low water potentials and high salt concentrations. Growth is impaired on malt extract agar and media which are deficient of important fungal macronutrients. On media lacking sulphur, potassium or magnesium, growth is halved. Growth is negligible but present on nitrogen- or phosphorus-deficient media. This observation of mild tolerance to nitrogen or phosphorus deficiency is attributed either to contamination of the media or the ability of A. carneus to utilize atmospheric sources of these nutrients for growth. The fungus is also resistant to heavy metal toxicity. Growth is inhibited but present after inoculation with cobalt, lead, nickel, zinc or cadmium, in concentrations ranging from 100‚Äì300 mg/L. No growth occurs at heavy metal concentrations exceeding 500 mg/L. Cobalt and cadmium are most toxic to A. carneus, while lead affects growth the least. A. carneus is known to produce citrinin, a secondary metabolite and mycotoxin characterized by its hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Sclerin, a compound which stimulates plant growth, and dihydrocitrinone, a metabolite of citrinin, have also been isolated from samples of the fungus. Additionally, A. carneus may be characterized by its production of novel secondary metabolites carneamides A-C, carnequinazolines A-C and aryl C-glycoside.  Morphology  On Czapek's agar, A. carneus colonies appear white at the beginning of development, progressing to variable shades of deep red, brownish red or yellow with age. The fungus produces conidiophores (250-400 Œºm) which are smooth and brown, yellow or colourless. Conidia are smooth, unpigmented and approximately spherical, with a diameter of 2.4-2.8 Œºm. Conidial heads are columnar in shape (150-200 Œºm x 25-35 Œºm) and initially white, appearing pale pink to brown in older cultures. Vesicles are globose, subglobose or hemispherical. Sterigmata are biseriate, while hyphae are characteristically thick-walled. Irregular hyphal branching may occur. Exudate may be absent or present in brown droplets with a strong odour. The morphology of A. carneus varies based on its growth medium or ecological habitat, presenting a challenge for identification. Grown on malt extract agar, A. carneus exhibits increased sporing, darker pigmentation and larger conidial heads. Otherwise, its morphology is consistent with the description above. A unique strain of A. carneus lacking its unique yellow, thick-walled hyphae was isolated in Arkansas. Its appearance was pale grey-brown. Additionally, a culture of A. carneus derived from estuarine sediment in Tasmania was characterized by a brown mycelium, indicating that morphological strain divergence may have occurred in marine environments. Habitat and ecology A. carneus is primarily a soil fungus, preferentially colonizing tropical and subtropical terrestrial environments. It is also found worldwide. The fungus inhabits alkaline, fertile soils and decomposing vegetation. A. carneus has been isolated from soils in Asia, Hawaii, north Africa, South America, Kuwait and southern Europe. The fungus colonizes a range of habitats, including podzolic forests, teak forests and mangrove swamps. It has also been found in forest nurseries in North America and eastern Europe. Rarely, it has been reported to grow on wheat and wild bees. A. carneus has also been isolated from the mycobiotia of the marine algae Laminaria sachalinensis in Russia and from estuarine sediment in Australia, demonstrating its potential to colonize aquatic organisms and environments.  Industrial and medical applications  A. carneus contributes to both medicine and industry, often simultaneously. The fungus produces a unique alkaline lipase (Aspergillus carneus lipase) with high pH and temperature tolerance, 1,3-regioselectivity, stability in organic solvents and esterification and transesterification properties. The lipase hydrolyzes a variety of oils and triglycerides, most notably sunflower oil. It is also extracellular, which improves yield during purification, and is resistant to inhibition by sodium propionate, a common food preservative. No other known fungal lipase exhibits this precise combination of abilities, making it a promising catalyst for industrial processes including synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, dairy products and detergents. Media containing glucose, sunflower oil, nitrogen and phosphorus may be used to maximize lipase yield from A. carneus. The Aspegillus carneus lipase is also capable of producing synthetic plant polyphenolics through deactylation, compounds which may protect against oxidative damage in human neurodegenerative disease. A. carneus also produces cystathionine-Œ≥-lyase (CGL), an enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of L-cystathionine, a human cysteine synthesis intermediate. Excess L-cystathionine due to CGL deficiency (cystathioninuria) is associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cystic fibrosis. Thus, fungal CGL may have therapeutic potential as a human CGL substitute. The activity of CGL isolated from A. carneus is maximized at 40 ¬∞C and slightly basic pH (8-9). It is also non-toxic and correlated with decreased blood concentrations of L-cystathionine in rabbits, a preliminary indicator of safety and therapeutic effectiveness in vivo. A. carneus secretes a low molecular weight xylanase which hydrolyzes heteroxylan, a component of the plant cell wall. The activity of A. carneus xylanase is stable over a broad pH range (3-10), but is optimized at acidic pH and 60 ¬∞C. The enzyme is highly specific to low-cost agricultural waste products, particularly corn cobs and coba husks, which it can degrade into xylooligosaccharides. Xylooligosaccharides may be used as food additives, components of animal feed and prebiotics. A. carneus also produces a thermostable pectinase, which can be used to degrade orange peel and pulp waste, notably in the Egyptian orange juice industry. A. carneus produces the known fungal metabolite marcfortine A, as well as 5 novel depsipeptides, aspergillicins A‚ÄìE. Marcfortine A is a paralytic, nematocidal agent which is also active against the commercially relevant ruminant parasite Haemonchus contortus. The aspergillicins exhibit mild cytotoxic activity. A. carneus produces other cytotoxic compounds, including sterigmatocystin, isopropylchaetominine and asteltoxin E, which are potently active against the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y and may have therapeutic potential as anti-cancer agents.  Role in disease  = Human disease = A. carneus is an infrequent human pathogen. However, 2 out of 9 cases of disseminated aspergillosis in a cohort of Czech patients, which had originally been attributed to Aspergillus candidus, were found to have instead been caused by A. carneus. The presence of A. carneus in clinical isolates from these patients was confirming using sequencing of the Œ≤-tubulin and calmodulin genes, in addition to the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA. A. carneus has also been implicated in a case of appendicitis in a 6-year-old Romanian boy with acute myeloid leukemia and neutropenia. The patient's resected appendix was encircled by hyphae, which had penetrated blood vessels inside the tissue. The causative agent of the infection was confirmed to be A. carneus using genomic sequencing of the ITS region. The patient was successfully treated with an appendectomy procedure and the triazole antifungal voriconazole, followed by fluconazole treatment until his neutropenia had resolved. The fungus was also susceptible to the anti-fungal drugs amphotericin B, itraconazole and posaconazole. A. carneus has also been implicated in 2 cases of human lung aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. Fragments of A. carneus hyphae and aleuriospores were identified in one patient's sputum at autopsy by morphological examination. = Animal disease = Rarely, the fungus has also been recognized as a contributor to animal disease. Grains and legumes colonized by A. carneus are toxic to ducklings. Additionally, wild type mice injected with A. carneus conidia (105) develop cerebral aspergillosis and ataxia after 2‚Äì10 days. Inoculation with corticosterone (10 mg) decreases the threshold for neurological symptoms to appear (to 104 conidia), indicating that immune suppression may increase vulnerability to A. carneus infection.

This fungus is a mesophile that reproduces both sexually and asexually. So far, there have been no reports of the fungus being pathogenic. History and taxonomy Arachniotus ruber was first described by Philippe √âdouard L√©on Van Tieghem in 1877 and it was thought to belong to the genus, Gymnoascus, due to similarities he observed in the gametangial initials. It was not until 1893 that Schroeter transferred the species to his recently established genus, Arachniotus, due to it possessing many of the corresponding traits. At the time, Schroeter did not designate a type species for the genus, which resulted in some debate until a lectotype, A. candidus, was eventually identified by Clements and Shear in 1931. With this change, A. ruber was excluded from the Arachniotus genus because it did not display type characteristics within its ascospores (3). Consequently, Orr, Ghosh, and Roy moved the species to the genus, Pseudoarachniotus, in 1977. Morphology Arachniotus ruber have discrete ascomata present, usually confluent and mostly spherical, measuring 20-200 Œºm and are red, orange, and brown in colour. Asci of A. ruber are ovoid, hyaline, and measure 10-13 x 7-10 Œºm. The ascospores of A. ruber are smooth, spherical, and vary in colour between red, orange, and yellow. They have an equatorial groove along the longitudinal axis, giving them a shape similar to that of a pulley wheel, and they measure 2.8-4.4 x 4-6.6 Œºm. Asexual spore states of A. ruber are represented by hyaline arthroaleuriospores measuring 8-30 x 2.2‚Äì3.3 Œºm. Habitat and ecology Arachniotus ruber has been found in the excrement of various animals, with the majority of samples being obtained in the United Kingdom and Germany. Van Tiegham first observed the species within dog and rat dung in France. Schroeter obtained samples of the species from dog and goat dung in Germany. There is also an occurrence of the species being found in hawk pellets by Dr. Arvids E. Apinis at the University of Nottingham in 1958. Another instance of A. ruber was found in a cave in Spain. Preparation and cultivation In order to sporulate under laboratory conditions, Arachniotus ruber is most commonly grown on freezing agar, which is a medium prepared using potatoes, agar, glucose, yeast extract, and activated carbon. As A. ruber grows on this medium, it will initially form white hyphae that will turn orange red and the colonies are pasty with occasional concentric rings of mycelium. The species has been observed to grow at 30 ¬∞C and show no further signs of growth at 37 ¬∞C. Usage and applications There have been very few studies that delve into the potential applications of Arachniotus ruber. One study done in 2016 displayed the potential of A. ruber being used to increase the nutritional value of wheat straw. Another, more recent study from 2019 investigated the species‚Äô usefulness in combatting malnutrition in developing countries. The study goes into detail about how malnutrition stems from protein deficiency, and performed an experiment using A. ruber. The experiment used dry banana peels as a basis for the substrate and prepared A. ruber in media, autoclaving the two together under various conditions. After some processing, the resulting feed was consumed by broiler chicks. The results of a proximate analysis showed that A. ruber was able to increase the nutritional value of the resulting biomass protein, showing potential in this area of research.

It is commonly found in the soils of forage grasses and grains. The species has been observed in a broad distribution of countries including Turkey, France, Canada, The United States, Japan and India. The species belongs to the group of dematiaceous hyphomycetes. History and taxonomy The Curvularia genus can be identified by its spiral borne phaeophragmospores, which contain both hyaline end cells and disproportionately large cells. They possess conidia with differing curvature and number of septa. Curvularia species C. inaequalis was first described in 1907 by ecologist Cornelius Lott Shear. The fungus was isolated from diseased New Jersey cranberry pulp and termed Helminthosporium inaequale. It was later renamed as Curvularia inaequalis, by Karl Boedijin. During his taxonomic organization and grouping of the Curvularia species, Boedijin recognized a similarity between the conidia of C. inaequalis and of the lunata Curvularia group. Recognition of the three-septate curved conidia motivated the introduction of the now popularized name. Growth and morphology The species' spore producing cells take on a model of sympodial growth. Conidia grow through successive apices which end in a terminal porospore. Growth can be affected by static magnetic fields with field flux densities. Under these conditions, the number of conidia are able to increase by a minimum of 68 percent. C. inaequalis is a filamentous fungus, with 3 to 12 densely packed filaments. The species is mostly brown in appearance, with pale brown end cells. Conidia themselves, consist of 3-5 cells with thick cell walls and a larger central cell. The diameter of the conidia ranges from 10 to 30 micrometers and have a slight leading curvature. Overall the appearance of the species is described as looking \\"cottony\\" with clear branching cells. The species can be difficult to identify due to its similar appearance to both Curvularia lunata and Curvularia geniculate. Instead, sequencing of nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) can be done to achieve accurate identification. Physiology The optimal growth temperature for the species is 30¬∞C. It is able to produce a multitude of chemical products with enzymatic properties. One enzyme produced is chloroperoxidase, which can catalyze halogenation reactions. Chloroperoxidase secreted from C. inaequalis contains vanadium active site. The presence of the vanadium substrate vanadate is essential for the function of chloroperoxidase. The compound glucose however, acts as an inhibitor for both enzyme function and production. In its active form, the enzyme is able to then produce hypochlorous acid, a strong oxidizing agent. It has been theorized that C. inaequalis utilizes chloroperoxidase and hypochlorous acid in combination to penetrate the host's cell wall. Other significant compounds produced include of B-galactosidase, 4-hydroxyradianthin and Curvularone A. The species is able to produce large amounts of B-galactosidase, which can hydrolyze lactose in acid whey. C. inaequalis also contains 4-hydroxyradianthin and Curvularone A compounds which have been identified as potential anti-tumor agents. Pathology and toxicology =Plant pathology and toxicology= C. inaequalis is known to cause leaf spot, also known as Leaf Bligh. Symptoms of infection by C. Inaequalis include the combination of oval shaped dark brown patches and leaf tip dieback. The infection slowly spreads causes necrosis until it has covered the entirety of the leaf. It results in the thinning of grass vegetation such as Zoysia, Bent, Bermuda and Buffalograss. Blighting is believed to be caused by two C. inaequalis mycotoxins, Pyrenocines A and B. Pyrenocines A is the more potent of the two, stunting growth and causing necrosis in vegetation. Both cause leaf tip die back in turf grass and leaf leakage of electrolytes in Bermuda grass. =Human pathology= C. inaequalis is typically a rare human pathogen. There are however, recorded medical cases that mention infection by the species. One such case is of an Eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis in an immunocompromised male. Endoscopic sinus surgery was required to remove a large polyposis. C. inaequalis was found to have grown favorably in the eosinophilic mucus. Oral itraconazole and other corticosteroids successfully were administered to prevent reinfection. Another case of C. inaequalis causing disease includes peritonitis in an elderly patient. It is suggested that contraction of the fungus occurs due to contact with soils. Furthermore, a case of recorded aerosolized C. inaequalis in one Canadian home supports airborne movement of spores as an important mode of transfer. While many cases of infection due to soil contact with the genus Curvularia, connection with the specific species has not yet been confirmed. Further studies are required to determine its human pathogen potential.

He was actively involved in politics during Reconstruction; he served as a lieutenant colonel in the South Carolina State Militia, town postmaster, and elected member of the South Carolina House of Representatives (1872-1876). While in the legislature, Simkins was admitted to and studied at the University of South Carolina, from which he graduated in 1876. In that election, former slaveholder and Confederate loyalist Wade Hampton III narrowly won the governorship, largely due to fraud and intimidation. Afterward, Simkins focused his efforts on building his church and organizing the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization in Edgefield. In 1885, he was admitted to the state bar, though he never practiced as a lawyer. Simkins is buried in the cemetery attached to the Macedonia Baptist Church in Edgefield, South Carolina.

Life  Kibenok was born into a family of firefighters, his father and his grandfather were both firemen. He would sometimes go with his father to emergencies and watch. This is presumably when Kibenok found his love for firefighting. He graduated from Cherkasy Fire And Technical School in August 1984 and was sent to work in Pripyat. He was a Lieutenant and the Chief Guard at Pripyat Fire Station (SPVCH-6). Kibenok is described as being strong-willed, kind by-nature, a caring man. He also had a love for Motorsports and owned a motorcycle. In his free time he would modify and work on his motorcycle and loved driving it.  Chernobyl Disaster  Kibenok and his men were resting at the station when the reactor exploded. An alarm came through a few minutes later. It woke everybody in the station up. Many even saw the explosion from their dormitory windows above the fire station. Kibenok sent three trucks to the power plant. He arrived at around 1:45 AM and met up with Pravik, Pravik briefed him on what had happened and instructed him to take his men to the roof of Reactor 3. Kibenok and his men climbed up there and started extinguishing fires around the ventilation chimney. After a few hours his men started to collapse. When a doctor arrived he said to him: Something's wrong... something's got my boys feeling all sick\\" He then collapsed and was taken by ambulance to Pripyat Hospital. He was then taken to Moscow Hospital No.6. Kibenok also received burns on the inside of his mouth and on his lips due to him inhaling burning bitumen and also received bitumen burns on his legs because of the melting bitumen that covered the roof. He died on the 11th May 1986 from radiation sickness a few hours after his friend and fellow commander Vladimir Pravik.

History and taxonomy  Pseudeurotium ovale was first classified by Amelia C. Stolk in 1954. It was assigned to the genus Pseudeurotium, along with thirteen other species Sogonov, M.V.; Schroers, H.J.; Gams, W.; Dijksterhuis, J.; Summerbell, R.C. (March 2005). \\"The hyphomcete Teberdinia hygrophila gen. nov., sp. nov. and related anamorphs of Pseudeurotium species\\". Mycologia. 97 (3): 695‚Äì709 ‚Äì via Taylor and Francis Online.. It was initially classified as a member of the family Eurotiaceae, but was reclassified forty years later by Malloch and Cain to its current family, PseudeurotiaceaeDennis, R.W.G. (1968). British Ascomycetes. Lehre, Germany: Verlag Von J. Cramer. p. 337-342.. Further more recent studies indicated that P. ovale could be classified as incertae sedis, as a result of analysis of conserved regions of its genome. Pseudeurotium ovale was originally identified on Jersey, an island in the English Channel, but has since been isolated in various regions, including Japan, South Africa, Italy and Sweden. Pseudeurotium ovale has been classified as a saprotroph, as it can thrive in a diverse set of environments, including soil, faeces and oatmeal agar. In some instances, growths on the nematode Heterodera or Globodera rostochiensis have contained P. ovale . __TOC__  Growth and morphology  Pseudeurotium ovale is a member of the Ascomycota, and therefore the fruiting body of P. ovale is called an ascocarp. Pseudeurotium ovale has a cleisothecium, or a fruiting body with a round shape. The membrane of the cleisothecium is continuous, and the spore-bearing structures or asci, lack germ pores. These normally allow germ tubes to exit the ascospores after they disperse from the fruiting body, and germination begins. The fungus germinates every 24 to 48 hours, and where the germ tube exits the fungal spores has yet to be identified. P. ovale is very similar in appearance to both Cleistothelebolus nipigonensis and Cephalotheca palearum, however there are slight differences between their physical characteristics that make them identifiable. The multilayered cell wall of Cephalotheca and the faecal- restricted growth environment for C. nipigonensis distinguish these fungi from P. ovale. = Physiology = The smooth, dark brown, oval-shaped spores of Pseudeurotium ovale are unique compared to other members of the species. The spore-bearing structures or asci are randomly distributed throughout the ascocarp in groups of eight. They also range from being seven to nine microns in width, and six to eight microns in length. The diameter of the fruiting body of P. ovale can be anywhere from 90 to 250 micrometers. The tissue of its single layer peridium is described as being densely packed into irregular columns and rows of cells. The cell wall of P. ovale spores are thin, growing into hyphae with no discernible septa Ellis, Martin B.; Ellis, J. Pamela (1988). Microfungi on miscellaneous substrates: an identification handbook. Portland OR, USA: Timber Press. p. 136. .. Pseudeurotium ovale grows well below human body temperature, at around 25¬∞C. An asexual state of P. ovale has also been identified, and has been classified as sympodial. The asexual spores or conidia of P. ovale form around three days after germination.  Pathology  Pseudeurotium ovale has not been found to be causative in human disease. It has only ever been identified in a few cases of onychomycosis of the toe nails in elderly individualsEnglish, M. P.; Harman, R. R. M.; Turvey, J. W. J. (1966). Pseudeurotium Ovalis in Toenails. London: Chelsea School of Chiropody. pp. 553‚Äì556.. Finger nails are very rarely infected by P. ovale. In instances of P. ovale colonization of toenails, it was found with a dermatophyte, such as Trichophyton rubrum, or in an immunocompromised individual. The nail appearance was severely altered, presenting with discolouration, and had lost their structural integrity. In one infection, the dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum was identified as the causative agent. Pseudeurotium ovale has also been found with Cephalosporium sp. in cases of onychomycosis; however their role in disease was unclear.  Medical applications  Some toxins produced by Pseudeurotium ovale have been found to have antimicrobial effects, and can act ton the immune response, dampening it in some cases. Ovalicin is a secondary metabolite, produced by the mycelium. Its main component is Œ≤-trans- begamotene, a volatile organic compound, otherwise known as a sesquiterpene. Environmental stressors, such as competition with other fungi or nutrient depravation, can trigger P. ovale to produce ovalicin as a response. Past studies have demonstrated the potential for ovalicin as a tumour suppressing drug, as it targets methionine aminopeptidase type 2. This protein is common to endothelial cells and is necessary for the formation of new blood vessels, which allow tumour growth. Œ≤-trans-begamotene is also produced by Aspergillus fumigatus.

(2019). Midnight in Chernobyl: the untold story of the worlds greatest nuclear disaster. London: Bantam Press.  Biography  Viktor Bryukhanov was born on 1 December 1935 in the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan (formerly USSR). Oldest son of the four children, his father used to work as a glazier and his mother was a cleaning lady. He later went on to become the only one of his brothers to receive higher education attaining a degree from Energy Department of the Tashkent Polytechnic in electrical engineering in 1959. After graduation, he was offered a job at Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan. He worked at the Angren Thermal Power Plant in the following positions: duty de-aerator installer, driver of feed pumps, assistant turbine driver, turbine driver, senior turbine workshop engineer, shift supervisor and became workshop director a year later. In 1966, he was invited to work at the Slavyanskaya Thermal Power Plant. He started as a senior foreman and rose up to the rank of head of workshop and finally, deputy chief engineer, finally resigning in 1970 to build a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. He was a member of Communist Party of Soviet Union since 1966. Between 1970 and 1986, he was repeatedly elected member of the regional district office of Kyiv, Chernobyl, and Prypiat city committees of the party. Viktor met his wife Valentina at Angren Power Plant. Valentina was an assistant to a turbine engineer and Viktor was a trainee fresh from the university. = Chernobyl Power Plant construction = During the late 1960s and early 1970s the energy minister offered Bryukhanov a new assignment - build an atomic power plant consisting of four RBMK reactors on the banks of the Prypiat River in Ukraine. Initially, Bryukhanov proposed construction of pressurized water reactors (PWAs), but this decision was met with opposition stating safety and economic reasons supporting construction of RBMK reactors, which was eventually performed. At a cost of almost 400 million rubles, Bryukhanov was responsible for building the reactors from scratch. As there was nothing nearby, he would need to bring materials and equipment to the construction site. He organized a temporary village, known as \\"Lesnoy\\", and had a schoolhouse built. In 1970, he was joined in Lesnoy by his wife, six-year-old daughter and infant son. By 1972, they had moved into the new city of Prypiat. During construction, deadlines were missed due to tight schedules, lack of construction equipment, and defective materials. Three years after assuming the role of director, the plant still had not been built. He offered to resign, but his resignation was torn up by his Party-appointed supervisor from the Energy Ministry in July 1972. On 1 August 1977, two years later than planned and more than seven years after the planning and the construction of the plant was launched, the first reactor of the Chernobyl Power Plant went online. At 8:10pm September 27 the same year, Ukraine's first nuclear electricity ran across 110 & 330 Kilovolt lines and on to the Soviet power grid. Bryukhanov ignored and failed to acknowledge the radioactive leak that occurred on September 9, 1982 when steam rose through a vent stack shared by reactors 1 and 2, indicating at least one broken pipe. The radioactive contaminants had spread fourteen kilometers from the plant and reached Prypiat. Bryukhanov also postponed an outstanding time- consuming safety test of reactor 4 so as to meet Moscow's launch deadline of December 31, 1983. By 1984, all the reactors of the Chernobyl Power Plant (formally known as the Vladimir I. Lenin Nuclear Power Plant) were online and functioning. = The disaster = On 26 April 1986, the head of the chemical division called Bryukhanov to report an incident at the station. Bryukhanov attempted to contact the shift supervisor but there was no answer at the fourth reactor block. He ordered all authorities to meet at the bunker at the headquarters of civil defense. While on a bus passing by the fourth reactor block, Bryukhanov realized the upper structure of the reactor was gone. The explosion had lifted the 1,000-ton reactor lid. Lacking high-range dosimeters, officials had difficulty determining whether a radiation release had occurred or not and, if so, how much radiation had been released. Bryukhanov, assisted by manager Dyatlov and chief engineer Fomin, kept ordering the operators to add more cooling water. Based on faulty information from Dyatlov, Bryukhanov continued to deny that the reactor core had exploded. At 3:00 AM, Bryukhanov, contacted Vladimir V. Marin, the official in charge of nuclear matters of the Communist Party at his Moscow home to report the accident and assure officials that the situation was under control. = Aftermath = After Bryukhanov went on a week's leave on 22 May, party officials made arrangements to remove him permanently from his position as director of the power plant. As part of discovery procedures dictated by the law, investigators brought him the materials they uncovered during course of their inquiries, which were used in a case against him. Bryukhanov also found a letter written by one of the Kurchatov Institute experts, which revealed the perilous design faults that were kept hidden from him and his staff for 16 years. On January 20, 1987, after he sat in isolation for six weeks, the prosecutor's office filed their closing indictment with the Supreme Court of USSR. All of the 48 files of evidence sent to Moscow were classified top secret. Viktor Bryukhanov was found guilty of gross violation of safety regulations, creating conditions that led to an explosion. Reports also mentioned that he failed to ensure correct and firm leadership in the difficult conditions of the accident and displayed irresponsibility and inability to organize. Bryukhanov was sentenced to 10 years in a labour camp along with five year sentence for abuse of power which ran concurrently . He accepted professional responsibility but denied criminal liability. On 3 July 1986, the decision of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU for the mistakes that led to the Chernobyl disaster meant that Bryukhanov was expelled from the CPSU. In September 1991, he was released ahead of schedule. After his release, he continued to work at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as head of the technical department. Bryukhanov has lived with his wife in the Desnyansky district in Kyiv since 1992. He worked an employee of Ukrinterenergo, Ukraine's state-owned energy company, in charge of liquidating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. By his 80th birthday in December 2015, Bryukhanov had retired due to failing eyesight, and had also suffered two strokes, followed by a third in 2016.

He worked with Bertolt Brecht in his Berliner Ensemble from the beginning in 1949, and was in demand internationally as a representative of Brecht's ideas. He was a theatre manager at the Staatstheater Stuttgart and the Schauspiel Frankfurt. Many of his productions were invited to the Berliner Theatertreffen festival. He worked internationally from 1980.  Life  Born in Deutmannsdorf near L√∂wenberg, Silesia, the son of a merchant, Palitzsch grew up in Dresden. After gymnasium, he attended a to become a graphic artist for advertisement. He ran an advertising agency together with his brother . He served in the military for five years and was a prisoner of war for a short time. When he returned to the destroyed Dresden, he was among the founders of the local chapter of the Red Cross. He began his career at the theatre in 1945 as a dramaturge for the Dresdner Volksb√ºhne. Bertolt Brecht called him in 1949 as graphic designer, dramaturge and assistant to his new Berliner Ensemble, which then still played at various stages in Berlin. In 1954, they moved to their own house, the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm. Palitzsch designed the logo which still is installed on the top of the building. In 1955, he was stage director for the first time, with Der gro√üe Tag des Gelehrten Wu. In 1956, he directed John Millington Synge's Der Held der westlichen Welt (The Playboy of the Western World with Heinz Schubert in the title role. He collaborated with Manfred Wekwerth for several plays. Theater am Schiffbauerdamm of the Berliner Ensemble, with Palitzsch's logo on top After Brecht's death on 18 August 1956, Palitzsch also worked at other German theatres. He staged the world premiere of Brecht's Der aufhaltsame Aufstieg des Arturo Ui (The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui at the Staatstheater Stuttgart in November 1958, with Wolfgang Kieling in the title role. The play was shown in Berlin in 1959, with Ekkehard Schall in the title role, and in Paris and London in 1960, where it marked Palitzsch's international recognition. In Paris, the production was awarded the Preis des Theaters der Nationen. In 1960/61, Wekwerth and Palitzsch produced with the DEFA a film Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder, starring Helene Weigel, Angelika Hurwicz, , Ernst Busch, Wolf Kaiser, Ekkehard Schall and Heinz Schubert. The film received a special award (Prize of the Jury or Anerkennungspreis) at the Locarno Film Festival in 1961. Palitzsch was called to West Germany, as a representative of authentic productions of Brecht's plays. He staged Eduard II in Stuttgart, Mann ist Mann (Man Equals Man in Wuppertal, and Der Kaukasische Kreidekreis (The Caucasian Chalk Circle and Der gute Mensch von Sezuan (The Good Person of Szechwan in Ulm. On 1 September 1961, shortly after the Berlin Wall, he directed there the West German premiere of Brecht's Der Prozess der Jeanne d‚ÄôArc zu Rouen 1431 (after by Anna Seghers), while other theatres refrained from playing Brecht's works, due to the political situation. After the first performance, Palitzsch announced via Intendant that he would not return to East Germany. In 1961, he directed Der kaukasische Kreidekreis in Oslo, with the young Liv Ullmann. He staged B√ºchner's Dantons Tod (Danton's Death in Stuttgart in 1962, and Brecht's Mutter Courage in Cologne in 1964, with in the title role. In 1966, he directed there Brecht's Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti (Mr Puntila and his Man Matti with Hanns Ernst J√§ger and Traugott Buhre in the title roles.

History Pillow Queens formed as a band in late 2016 when the group released their first demo EP entitled Calm Girls. The release of this record was followed by performances on the Irish festival circuit, including at Electric Picnic and All Together Now. After the release of their second EP, State of the State, the group performed with the likes of Pussy Riot, Future Islands, Idles and performed in the IMRO room at Other Voices. In a mid-2019 interview with RT√â, the band stated that they were in the studio working on their debut LP, tentatively due to be released in mid-2020. On 1 November 2019, Pillow Queens released the single \\"Brothers\\", and the accompanying \\"Brothers (Acoustic)\\". The band played two further songs from their upcoming album, \\"Child of Prague\\" and \\"Liffey\\", on 9 November 2019, during a set in Reykjav√≠k as part of Iceland Airwaves 2019. In 2020, their single Gay Girls featured on the soundtrack to the Amazon Original Irish film Dating Amber. In 2020, the band were part of \\"Irish Women in Harmony\\", an Irish collective of female singers and musicians that recorded a version of Dreams in aid of the charity SafeIreland, which deals with domestic abuse which had reportedly risen significantly during the Covid-19 lockdown. Style The band have both pop and punk influences; however, they have been hesitant to define their work as either, in order to avoid being labeled.

Kent Professor of Law at Boston University School of Law and was previously the Rivkin Radler Distinguished Professor of Law at Hofstra Law School. McClain's work focuses on family law, sex equality, and feminist legal theory. Biography McClain studied religion and government at Oberlin College, where she graduated with high honors. She continued her education at the University of Chicago Divinity School, graduating with a master's in religious studies. McClain graduated cum laude with her J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center, where she was an editor on The Georgetown Law Journal. Upon graduation, McClain worked as an attorney in the litigation department at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and earned her LL.M. from New York University School of Law in 1991. That same year, she began her academic career at Hofstra Law School, where she was appointed the Rivkin Radler Distinguished Professor of Law and the co-director of the Institute for the Study of Gender, Law, and Policy. McClain married James E. Fleming in 1992. McClain started teaching at Boston University School of Law in 2007. She also teaches in the Boston University College of Arts & Sciences in the Women's, Gender, & Sexuality Studies Program. McClain is a member of the American Law Institute, where she works in the Members Consultative Group for the Restatement of the Law, Children and the Law. She is also involved in the Council on Contemporary Families, the American Political Science Association, and the American Society for Political and Legal Philosophy. McClain has previously served as the chair of the Association of American Law Schools Section on Family and Juvenile Law, and on the advisory board for The Feminist Sexual Ethics Project at Brandeis University. She has appeared on C-SPAN and Minnesota Public Radio, and is admitted to the bar in New York. Scholarship =Constitutional theory= With her husband, James E. Fleming, McClain defends traditional liberal rights in Ordered Liberty: Rights, Responsibilities, and Virtues, and attempts to show there is a middle ground between liberal, civic republican, communitarian, and progressive camps. Individual rights not only protect individuals, but also enable citizens to responsibly and autonomously choose how to be a good citizen. Fleming and McClain argue this \\"responsibility as autonomy\\" exercised when government does not attempt to steer citizens in a particular direction, is different from \\"responsibility as accountability\\" to society advocated by communitarians. They advance that government can provide information and support for all alternatives that allows individuals to reflect and choose what is best. Critics think this is easier in theory than in practice; differently situated individuals can interpret the intended persuasion behind the same piece of information differently. Additionally, if government intervention is necessary to create conditions for an individual to be able to make an autonomous choice, for example, \\"the material and social preconditions for women's equal citizenship,\\" it is probable the government will have to restrict others' autonomy. (Quoting James E. Fleming & Linda McClain, Ordered Liberty: Rights, Responsibilities, and Virtues 79 (2012)). Although McClain and Fleming's argument relies on the belief that individuals will usually choose to act in the best interests of society, they acknowledge that rights should not be absolute; they should be limited when there is a stronger competing interest. McClain and Fleming examine a line of Supreme Court abortion cases, an area communitarians identify with absolute rights, and note that the balancing of individual rights and state interests is taking place, not the application of strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the rational basis test. (Reviewing James E. Fleming & Linda C. McClain, Ordered Liberty: Rights, Responsibilities, and Virtues (Harvard University Press, 2013). When the public is reasonably divided whether an action, for example, abortion, should be permissible, McClain and Fleming argue that it should be left to individual choice, and McClain has explained that an individual right is necessary to give the individual space to make the important decision autonomously. (Citing Linda M. McClain, The Poverty of Privacy?, 3 Columbia Journal of Gender & Law 119, 129 (1992)). This line of reasoning sees the Constitution as a living document, changing with the needs of society. Tolerance of different approaches, which McClain has argued should be \\"toleration as respect,\\" as opposed to grudging tolerance, (Citing Linda C. McClain, Toleration, Autonomy, and Governmental Promotion of Good Lives: Beyond \\"Empty\\" Toleration to Toleration as Respect, 59 Ohio St. L.J. 19, 23-23 (1998)). should only be disrupted if a policy is supported by the best reasons provided through public debate. Individuals engaging in public debate in a \\"deliberative democracy\\" (Citing James E. Fleming & Linda C. McClain, In Search of a Substantive Republic, 76 Tex. L. Rev. 509, 511 (1997)). should not be focused on imposing their view of the good on everyone else, but seek to achieve a common good. (Citing Linda C. McClain & James E. Fleming, Some Questions for Civil Society-Revivalists, 75 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 301, 346 (2000)). Critics of tolerance argue it does not provide sufficient guidance and creates tacit approval of actions that have not been considered by society. However, when discussing constitutional rights, freedom is from government action; private actors are still free to disapprove of others' actions. (Reviewing Ordered Liberty: Rights, Responsibilities, and Virtues). McClain has noted that public debate can identify the best societal values for democracy to be presented as civics education required by the state, even when that requirement conflicts with religious liberty interests of groups, such as homeschoolers. One counterargument is whether government can be trusted to teach these values, especially questioning the wisdom of those in power and the laws as written. McClain and Fleming have also argued that when the consequences of not having a choice would negatively impact individuals in a personal way, denying individuals that choice would create a moral harm.(Citing James E. Fleming and Linda C. McClain, \\"The Right to Privacy in Sandel's Procedural Republic,\\" in Debating Democracy's Discontent: Essays on American Politics, Law, and Public Philosophy 249, 254 (eds. Anita L. Allen & Milton C. Regan, Jr. 1998)). For example, prior to the legalization of same- sex marriage in the United States, McClain argued that failure to recognize same-sex marriages was disrespectful to same-sex couples and prevented them from fully functioning in democratic life. (Citing Linda McClain, Toleration, Autonomy, and Governmental Promotion of Good Lives: Beyond \\"Empty\\" Toleration to Toleration as Respect 59 Ohio St. L.J. 19, 121-22 (1998)). Although Fleming and McClain claimed to be advocating political liberalism, critics felt examples in Ordered Liberty pushed beyond the natural understanding of citizenship and into the traditionally more private sphere associated with comprehensive liberalism. Others argued that the examples chosen, primarily in family law and equality cases, lent themselves to an autonomy as self- government argument. It is harder to apply the same theory to other rights, such as free speech cases involving offensive and disrespectful language or zealous protection of a criminal defendant's procedural rights. Arguments regarding individual rights and autonomy are also difficult to apply in a post Citizens United world where organizations possess constitutional rights. McClain has also defended liberalism against feminist critique that encouraging autonomy leads to socially disconnected individuals, (Citing Linda C. McClain, 'Atomistic Man' Revisited: Liberalism, Connection, and Feminist Jurisprudence, 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1171, 1173-76 (1992)). arguing that although rights necessarily create some protective space between individuals, (Citing Linda C. McClain, \\"Atomistic Man\\" Revisited: Liberalism, Connection, and Feminist Jurisprudence, 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1171 (1992)). liberal theory also allows for interdependency that can result in increased individual self-worth and respect amongst individuals. =Religious liberty= When religions proscribe rights and responsibilities associated with marriage, McClain has argued that these religious communities be exempt from secular domestic relations law instead of trying to fit the religious law within state law. (Citing McClain, Linda C. 2013. \\"Marriage Pluralism, Family Law Jurisdiction, and Sex Equality in the United States.\\" In Gender, Religion, & Family Law: Theorizing Conflicts Between Women's Rights and Cultural Traditions, eds. Lisa Fishbayn Joffe and Sylvia Neil, 76-115. Waltham, MA: Brandeis University Press). =Reproductive rights= McClain has examined the language surrounding the decision to have an abortion in legal decisions, noting that when the U.S. Supreme Court listed non-life-threatening reasons for abortion, such as convenience and not wanting children, it implied that the pregnant woman's desires outweighed the fetus's possible life.(citing Linda C. McClain, \\"Equality, Oppression, and Abortion: Women Who Oppose Abortion Rights in the Name of Feminism,\\" in Susan Ostrov Weisser and Jennifer Fleischner, eds., Feminist Nightmares, Women at Odd: Feminism and the Problem of Sisterhood (New York: New York University Press, 1994), 159, 168). McClain has also written about how pro-life advocates describe the decision to have an abortion as an \\"irresponsible\\" choice.(Citing Linda C. McClain, Rights and Irresponsibility, 43 Duke L.J. 989 (1994)). McClain rejects this idea, noting that many women choose to have an abortion because they believe it would be wrong to bring a child into their current social and economic situation. (Citing Linda C. McClain, The Place of Families: Fostering Capacity, Equality, and Responsibility 250 (2006)). McClain believes women should have the right to choose abortion in these instances, and she does not believe government should encourage women to refrain from sexual intercourse if they are not prepared to provide for any resulting children. She has examined the description of men as unable to control their sexual urges as a cultural excuse of men's conduct, (Citing Linda C. McClain, \\"Irresponsible\\" Reproduction, 47 Hastings L.J. 339, 422 (1996)). and rejects that women should be responsible for ensuring men commit to any children resulting from sexual activity by requiring the couple marry before having sex. (Citing Linda C. McClain, The Place of Families: Fostering Capacity, Equality, and Responsibility 258, 272 (2006)). Don Browning counters that government encouragement of sexual activity within marriage does not have to burden women with that responsibility, but can move it to the institution of marriage via societal expectations that are placed on both men. McClain, however, believes that American legal and cultural changes have rendered the channeling of sex into marriage obsolete. (Citing Linda McClain, Love, Marriage, and the Baby Carriage: Revisiting the Channeling Function of Family Law, 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 2133 (2007)). Irresponsibility language is also applied to women who choose to give birth. McClain has discussed how descriptions of single mothers, teenage mothers, and mothers receiving welfare as irresponsible (Citing Linda C. McClain, \\"Irresponsible\\" Reproduction, 47 Hastings L.J. 339, 342 (1996)). has led to beliefs that single mothers are immoral. (Citing Linda C. McClain, \\"Irresponsible\\" Reproduction, 47 Hastings Law Journal 339, 345-64 (1996)). McClain has asserted that examining abortion through a relational feminist lens puts abortion rights at risk. by encouraging women to be legally required to take on traditional responsibilities. (Citing Linda C. McClain, \\"Atomistic Man\\" Revisited: Liberalism, Connection, and Feminist Jurisprudence, 65 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1171, 1251-56 (1992)). =Sex equality= McClain has identified religious influences that encourage female submission and considered how government can promote sex equality on a local level, advocating for pro-sex equality public school instruction and required premarital counseling regarding property ownership and domestic violence. Her writings on public education and sex equality also extend to sex education, where she advocates applying liberal feminist theory of sexuality, which recognizes sexual desire and expression as normal, and expects sexual responsibility from all individuals regardless of gender. (Reviewing Linda C. McClain, Some ABCs of Feminist Sex Education (In Light of the Sexuality Critique of Legal Feminism), 15 Colum. J. Gender & L. 63 (2006)). In addition to teaching responsibility, sex education should strive to foster capacity and equality (Reviewing Linda C. McClain, Some ABCs of Feminist Sex Education (In Light of the Sexuality Critique of Legal Feminism), 15 Colum. J. Gender & L. 63 (2005)). by covering all types of sexual activity and discussing the societal context of sex, gendered messages that have been internalized, and the \\"sexual double standard.\\" (Citing Linda C. McClain, Some ABCs of Feminist Sex Education (in Light of the Sexuality Critique of Legal Feminism), 15 Columbia Journal of Gender & Law 63, 68-69 (2006)). Other legal scholars have expressed concerns about a public school sex education program that legitimizes various sexual activities when that conflicts with parental teachings. McClain believes government has an obligation to expose children to teachings that vary from their parents' beliefs to encourage open-mindedness and critical thinking. McClain has also advocated that governments look beyond marriage and the traditional nuclear family structure when devising programs to help families, so that all types of families' needs are recognized and considered important. This contributes to sex equality by legitimizing family arrangements outside of the traditional male head of household and female caretaker model. (Citing McClain, L.C. 2014. 'Federal Family Policy and Family Values from Clinton to Obama, 1992-2012 and Beyond.' Michigan State Law Review, 2013: 1621-1718). McClain has likened the female body to a castle or sanctuary entitled to the utmost privacy protections extended to the home under tort law (Citing Linda C. McClain, Inviobility and Privacy: The Castle, the Sanctuary, and the Body, 7 Yale J.L. & Human. 195, 202-03 (1995)). with the hope of legally protecting women's sexual autonomy and freedom from physical violence. (Citing Linda C. McClain, Inviobility and Privacy: The Castle, the Sanctuary, and the Body, 7 Yale J.L. & Human. 195, 195-96, 240 (1995)). She has been critical of marital rape exemptions because they disregard women's autonomy, (Quoting Linda C. McClain, Inviolability and Privacy: The Castle, the Sanctuary, and the Body, 7 Yale J.L. & Human. 195, 213 (1995)). and has not found that husbands' privacy rights justify the exemption (Citing Linda C. McClain, Inviolability and Privacy: The Castle, the Sanctuary, and the Body, 7 Yale J.L. & Human. 195, 217 (1995)). or prevent their prosecution for domestic violence. (Citing Linda C. McClain, Inviolability and Privacy: The Castle, the Sanctuary, and the Body, 7 Yale J.L. & Human. 195, 207-20 (1995)). =Family law= McClain's book, The Place of Families: Fostering Capacity, Equality, and Responsibility, is \\"a feminist vision of the family in moral terms,\\" and has been placed between critical feminist theories that seek to discontinue government regulation of marriage and those legal scholars, such as Margaret Brinig and Milton Regan, who favor continued state-governed marriage. She states that the institution of marriage should be retained, but that its benefits should be open to more people, even if they do not want to legally marry, and government programs encouraging marriage need to consider how poverty impacts the ability to sustain healthy relationships. (Citing Linda C. McClain, The Place of Families: Fostering Capacity, Equality, and Responsibility 132-34 (2006)). Her work diverts from mainstream family law by arguing that creating equality in and amongst all familial relationships is a moral imperative and a public good. Whereas other scholars believe social institutions can help families prepare children for democratic participation, McClain, with James Fleming, has expressed concerns about relying on civil society institutions with their own agendas for moral education. (Citing Linda C. McClain & James E. Fleming, Some Questions for Civil Society Revivalists, 75 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 301 (2000)). McClain believes government persuasion is needed to create the appropriate environment by helping working parents through parental leave and subsidies for higher quality care. The subtitle of The Place of Families, \\"Fostering Capacity, Equality, and Responsibility,\\" outlines the values significant enough to require government action. Criticism of McClain's work asks how she can argue government should promote gender equality within families while rejecting state promotion of sexual activity within the confines of marriage. Other government action criticism notes that to create equality among different family types, government must make up deficits experienced by children due to their parents' sub-optimal decisions, and this support could encourage undesired adult behavior. There is also a question whether government supports can create true equality among different types of families, or whether subsidies create marginalized family groups. Critics also take issue with McClain's use of the moral good to support all families, regardless of makeup, while ignoring empirical evidence of the enhanced premoral goods some family makeups generally bestow on children. McClain addressed this criticism in a subsequent article, where she acknowledged the channelling function of family law, encouraging people to marry, sometimes conflicts with fairness, but that channelling is still a legitimate purpose of family law, and marriage is something individuals in non-traditional families still strive for. Additionally, some of the institutions, such as the Institute for American Values, associated with empirical evidence showing greater benefits to children in families with low-conflict, two married biological parents, were also quick to turn out reports questioning the future of marriage in response to movement in the same-sex marriage debate. She has also responded to empirical evidence that women in \\"traditional\\" gender role marriages are more satisfied that women in egalitarian relationships, noting that women in traditional marriages likely have lower expectations that are met, whereas women in egalitarian relationships have higher expectations that are met less often. McClain has also considered compensation for care work, arguing that raising children well instills traits that allow them to participate in democratic government. (Citing Linda C. McClain, Care as a Public Value: Linking Responsibility, Resources, and Republicanism, 76 Chicago-Kent Law Review, 1673, 1697-702 (2001)). (Citing Linda McClain, The Place of Families: Fostering Capacity, Equality, and Responsibility 68-73 (2006)). She has also examined how women respond to inequality by caring for the disadvantaged, which itself generates societal value. (Citing Linda C. McClain, Atomistic Man Revisited: Liberalism, Connection, and Feminist Jurisprudence, 65 Southern California Law Review 1171, 1184 (1992)). However, while women have traditionally been the primary caretakers, McClain believes government programming should encourage both genders to engage in this important work. She believes caring for children alone is a valuable contribution to society and has criticized the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act for requiring paid work contributions in addition to care work. (Citing Linda C. McClain, 'Citizenship Begins at Home: The New Social Contract and Working Families,' in Henry Tam (ed.), Progressive Politics in the Global Age (Oxford: Polity Press, 2001), 97-99, 101). However, McClain's recommendations are not simply compensating parents for the caretaking functions they perform; she has argued that caring for children should be considered a public function that is part of good self-government, and as such, society should do more to support parent education, work-life balance, (Citing Linda C. McClain, 'Citizenship Begins at Home: The New Social Contract and Working Families,' in Henry Tam (ed.), Progressive Politics in the Global Age (Oxford: Polity Press, 2001), 101; Linda C.

Others have questioned making child care a public value, worried that it would allow majority views to define family. Additionally, there are concerns that employer accommodation of employee mothers will shift the burden to childless female employees instead of all childless employees. =Tort law= Although other legal scholars, such as Leslie Bender, have argued the feminist ethic of care requires a duty to rescue, McClain has disagreed, distinguishing the ethic of care from beneficence.

The organization traces its roots to the 1976 march, in which 75 individuals protested the city's refusal of a permit to host an official march. Today, Rhode Island Pride is one of the largest and most active LGBTQ organizations in Rhode Island, hosting community events and offering resources to Rhode Island's LGBTQ population. Rhode Island Pride's PrideFest is the organization's largest initiative, attracting more than a hundred thousand people to Providence, RI every June for festivities including a marketplace, a block party, and a parade, among other events. PrideFest's premiere event is its Illuminated Night Pride Parade, a pride parade held on the Saturday evening of PrideFest.  History  In 1976, lesbian and gay Rhode Islanders organized their first pride march with about 75 people in attendance. Called the \\"76ers,\\" these individuals marched through downtown Providence despite state and city leaders attempting to block the parade. However, organizers litigated for legal permission to march. This event marked an important step in formal organizing for LGBTQ rights in Rhode Island, establishing the foundation for the group that would become Rhode Island Pride. In the next four decades, participation grew annually from just under 100 in 1976 to over 60,000 at RI PrideFest in 2019. In RI, early gay pride celebrations were some of the first steps that eventually led to civil rights protections being extended to gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals in 1995, and to transgender individuals in 2001. In the 1980s, the previous loosely organized, grassroots marches became more organized and yet less radical parades. Under pressure from conservative community members, the marches dropped \\"Liberation\\" and \\"Freedom\\" from their names, replacing them with the philosophy of \\"Gay Pride.\\" However, the Greek lambda symbol and the pink triangle, which had been revolutionary symbols of the Gay Liberation Movement, were incorporated into the Gay Pride, or Pride, movement, providing some symbolic continuity with its more radical beginnings. In 1997, the very first rainbow flag was flown over a government building in the state of RI. Soon after, in 2001, the Illuminated Night Parade that transformed the Pride celebration was launched.  PrideFest  PrideFest is an annual LGBT pride celebration, coinciding with Pride Month. The current iteration consists of several events held during a designated weekend in mid- June. In 2019, the Saturday of PrideFest included the Hasbro Kids Zone, food trucks, and live entertainment during the day, followed by the Illuminated Night Pride Parade in the evening. The following Sunday featured a drag brunch. The Illuminated Pride Parade is PrideFest's largest event, attracting over 100,000 attendees in 2019, exceeding the expectations of 60,000 attendees. After being introduced in 2001, the parade dramatically boosted the attendance and community involvement in PrideFest. In 2018, PrideFest led to Providence being listed as one of the \\"World's Best Destinations for LGBT Pride Celebrations\\" by National Geographic.  Organization  Rhode Island Pride is a 501(c)3 organization consisting of various committees, volunteers, and a board of directors. The organization hosts year-round events and programs for the Rhode Island community, including the Rhode Island Pride Honors Gala and the Rhode Island Pride Pageant.

The Plague of Doves follows the townsfolk of Pluto, North Dakota, who are plagued by a farming family's unsolved murder from generations prior. The novel incorporates Erdrich's multiple narrator trope that is present in other works including the Love Medicine series. Its sequel is the National Book Award winning novel The Round House. Erdrich concluded the \\"Justice\\" trilogy with LaRose in 2016. Background The central plot for The Plague of Doves revolves around an act of racism that took place in the early 20th century. Peter G. Beidler outlines how Louise Erdrich's plot for the novel was influenced by real-life events that happened in North Dakota in the late 1890s. As he explains, a white family, the Spicers, were murdered by a group of Native Americans. While the murderers were tried and sentenced to death for their crimes, the citizens of the town believed the three witnesses, also Native Americans, were guilty as well. Nine months after the trial, the citizens stormed the jailhouse where the men were being held, overpowered the guards, and proceeded to hang the three men in question. One of the men was a 19-year-old boy named Paul Holy Track, believed to be the direct influence for Erdrich's character, the thirteen-year-old Holy Track. Character List * Evelina Harp: The novel's first named narrator. She matures throughout the novel while exploring notions of bisexuality and uncovering Pluto's past. * Mooshum/ Seraph Milk: Evelina's grandfather who tells her about the reservation's past. * Shamengwa: Mooshum's brother. He is a violinist with a crippled arm who later tutors Corwin Peace. * Judge Antone Bazil Coutts: The tribal judge. He is the novel's second narrator. He has an affair with Dr. Cordelia Lochren. * Corwin Peace: Evelina's elementary school crush. He is a mischievous delinquent born out of wedlock, and he matures under Shamengwa's tutelage. * Billy Peace: Marn Wolde's husband with familial connections to the area's past. He becomes a spiritual leader to his family and the community. * Marn Wolde: Billy Peace's wife. He is the novel's third narrator. She seeks eccentric spirituality to escape her self-described prison. * Uncle Warren Wolde: Marn Wolde's uncle. He is a senile man in a mental hospital whose past actions have shaped the entire town. * Dr. Cordelia Lochren: The novel's last narrator. She is the surviving child of a family massacre; she harbors prejudices in her later years. Summary The novel begins with a family's grisly murder resulting in a baby being the only surviving member. A young girl named Evelina, who struggles with her sexuality in grade school, listens to her grandfather's, Mooshum's, tales of Pluto, North Dakota's past. In 1896, a flock of doves terrorized the town and the people within it. Mooshum also explains how he was the only surviving member of a lynch mob who sought answers about the murders that resulted in an orphaned child. This trauma caused Mooshum to flee the town for years before returning to the reservation, married and ready to start a family. Upon returning, Mooshum and his brother, Shamengwa, develop a dependency on alcohol. These tales leave Evelina with more questions than answers, and Mooshum is hesitant to divulge everything. Evelina is nervous to express the attraction she has for both her teacher and her classmate. Next enters Billy Peace, whose union with the woman who rejected Mooshum's romantic advances results in a child out of wedlock. After the kidnapping of Billy's child's mother backfires, he goes to join the army. The army is Billy's introduction to religion. When Billy returns home, he starts a church. Billy marries Marn Wolde who both bond over running away from a past issues. Marn is eventually not happy with her marriage or with the way Billy disciplines their children or how he interacts with her. Marn murders her husband and flees Pluto with her children in tow. An older Evelina, now working at the diner, runs into Marn. The interaction recalls Evelina's former attractions to Marn's nephew. Evelina is also given information from her former crush and teacher that causes her to suffer mentally. While at the mental hospital, Evelina meets with patients but takes note of the weird actions of one in particular named Warren Wolde. Warren Wolde dies in the hospital after hearing Corwin Peace play the violin while visiting Evelina. His death unravels some of the town's hidden mystery. Themes =Ojibwe and M√©tis History= M√©tis and Ojibwe history is featured throughout the novel. The M√©tis connection comes to the forefront with the character Mooshum noting Louis Riel as a personal hero. Evelina also mentions a picture of Riel that her mother kept on display. The characters frequently refer to Riel and imagine what could have been had he succeeded in establishing a Michif nation. Furthermore, throughout the novel the characters speak in both Michif and Anishinaabe. As Corrine Bancroft argues, Erdrich's novel allows readers \\"to face the way history still bleeds into the present and challenges us to develop a type of responsibility that is attentive to different and possibly incommensurate human experiences.\\" =Crime= Crime and punishment are two prominent themes in The Plague of Doves. Critic Lara Feigel notes that Erdrich offers several moments where the issues of what constitutes justice emerge as central to the plot. In addition to the main plot regarding the family's murder, there are other instances of criminal enterprises. For example, Billy Peace plans to rob John Wildstrand of $10,000. For his part, Wildstrand also suggests that the two kidnap of Neve who is his current wife. They agree upon this plan and Billy kidnaps Neve, then makes John tie himself up, and John goes the extra mile to fake tears in front of Neve. =Dedication and Love= Feigel also explains how the world that Erdrich builds is entangled with love and dedication. For example, Joseph and Bull's journey through the storm exemplifies this factor by showcasing their determination to stick together and withstand a cold storm. Evelina and Corwin also remain loyal friends throughout the novel. Reception The Plague of Doves received many favorable reviews that often deemed it a challenging, and more than often multilayered book at the time of its release. It was named a ‚ÄúBest Book of The Year‚Äù by The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, and The Christian Science Monitor. In a review from The New York Times, Bruce Barcott mentions that Erdrich has created ‚Äúan often gorgeous, sometimes maddeningly opaque portrait of a community strangled by its own history.‚Äù In another, Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times states that Erdrich \\"uses several characters to narrate alternating chapters, giving us a choral story that unfolds from multiple perspectives.\\" Additionally, the book was also selected as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2009. In the same year, the novel also won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, which is awarded to books that have made a vital contribution to understanding racism and human diversity.

A member of the division Ascomycota, Zopfiella ebriosa is characterized by small and asymmetrical asci, presence of ostioles, and possession of germ slits. History and taxonomy This fungus' species epithet ebriosa from the Latin word meaning \\"habitually drunk\\" is likely attributed due to the presence of seemingly random colouration and asymmetrical shape of its asci. The species was incorrectly described to be Zopfiella flammifera - a coprophilous fungus found in Nigerian soil as well as another coprophilous fungus Podospora minicauda that is located on herbivore dung described by Locquin-Linard. Zopfiella ebriosa was eventually attributed its own species name due to its expression of comparatively much smaller and lopsided ascospores. Although this fungus has been discovered numerous times, two mycologists independently examined the fungus' history by looking at fungal records of Quercus suber bark and other cork substrates before collaborating on a paper summarizing the genus Zopfiella. A possible previous name given to this fungus may have been Rosellinia cellarum attributed to Lambotte who composed many studies in late 19th century Belgian wine cellars. Lambotte originally placed R. cellarum into the family Xylariaceae which is a family baring some resemblance to Z. ebriosa. Growth and morphology The ascospores of Z. ebriosa are smaller than average for the family Xylariaceae, despite exhibiting a similar inequilateral or asymmetrical property. Z. ebriosa exhibits clear ascospores similar to those of Xyliariaceae, however, contrary to the family Xylariaceae possessing a germ pore, a germ slit is found in Z. ebriosa. This lack of germ pores poses a question of their association with the genus Zopfiella which most typically have pores at or near the apex of the spore. The morphology of Z. ebriosa is described extensively by Guarro et al in their collaborative paper on the genus Zopfiella. The fungus' imperfectly globose ascomata range from 180-300 Œºm in diameter containing a short broad neck and express strong pigmentation in the upper region. Their two-celled ascospores are arranged uniseriately with one cell conspicuously bulging featuring dark brown patches. The authors did not observe an asexual or anamorphic state, however the sexual colonies grow very slowly on cherry decoction agar, reaching 50 mm after 30 days at 21 ¬∞C with no growth found when placed in the same medium at 30 ¬∞C. Z. ebriosa also exhibit cylindrical asci and contain ostioles atypical of the Zopfiella however, within the species, variation has been found when discussing ostiole presence. All samples of the species contained ascomata that are ostiolate when placed on natural substrates that was paired with active release of spores from asci. Conversely, in culture, ascomata of Z. ebriosa can be cleistothecial and asci deliquesce (or liquify) to release spores. Despite glaring differences from typical Zopfiella species, the researchers decided it would be premature to create a new genus strictly containing this fungus with the limited information available to them about it. Habitat As of 1991, this fungus has only been found on wine corks, which may originate from the natural bark of the cork oak having survived the sterilization processes needed to form bottle stoppers. Despite being found on the corks of unopened bottles, the quality of the wine was not hindered in any way. Zopfiella ebriosa seems to have an affinity for high-quality wines potentially due to the stoppers found in cheaper wines being composed of granulated/re-formed cork which can be hypothesized to contain anti-fungal spore capabilities due to the manufacturing process of the cork.

It was mainly found on plant stems and leaves especially those grow in greenhouses or in similar environments. The colonies are white and hairy, form hoar-frost on affected plants. Botryosporium longibrachiatum causes diseases in plant species including sea-lavender, burley tobacco and sweet basil. The disease was not commonly occurred and the treatment was poorly studied. History and taxonomy The species Botryosporium longibrachiatum was first identified by Marie R. in 1890 and first published on the peer-reviewed journal Annales Mycologici in 1903. It is a species of Botryosporium Corda and has other 2 varieties: Botryopsorium longibrachiatum var. macrospora and Botryopsorium longibrachiatum var. macrosporum. Both varieties were described based on spore size and name type by Sharma N.D. in 1978. There were 17 georeferenced records of Botryosporium longibrachiatum which were distributed in Bihar, Great Britain, Karnataka, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Western Australia, etc. Morphology Colonies are hairy, non-pigmented and extensive with a pure white color. The main body of conidiophores are long branched and bear lateral. The side branches grow indeterminate with a clavate shape that is narrower at the attachment to the main body and broader at the tip. Up to six ampullaes can bear on one tip at the same time. The size of the conidia is 8-11Œºm long and 4-4.5 wide which forms an ellipsoid shape. Dried colony of Botryotrichum longibrachiatum grown on Potato Dextrose Agar at 25 C for 7 days Habitat and ecology Botryosporium longibrachiatum was largely recorded to grow on dead leaves and stems. It was also found on twine that was used in greenhouses to support plant growth such as tomatoes and eggplants. In general, the genus Botryosporium was rarely discovered from soil and there was only one record of Botryosporium in Ontario by 1968. Another possible place for Botryosporium to appear is above the potting soil in greenhouses. Several evidences have shown that the fungus favors cool and humid environment especially places like greenhouses. Disease in plants In 2013, Botryosporium longibrachiatum was found to cause diseases in sea-lavender that grew in polyethylene-film-covered greenhouses as a commercial cut flower in Gochang County, Korea. The stems of affected plants turned into a dark brown color and were covered with the fungus Botryosporium longibrachiatum which looks like hoar frost. Other plant species including burley tobacco and sweet basil were also affected by this fungus. =Pathogenicity test= Isolated specimen was submitted to Korea University Herbarium for further studies. Koch‚Äôs postulates was used to test the pathogenicity of Botryosporium longibrachiatum. The fungal DNA was first isolated from B. longibrachiatum then the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA was amplified with ITS1/ITS4 primers. After sequencing, a BLAST search identified ‚â•99% ITS sequence of the fungus from sweet basil. Then five treatment plants were set to be transferred the colonized mycelial agar individually and five control plants got non-colonized agar. All experimental plants were incubated under the same condition similar to those in the greenhouses for 3 to4 days. The result was that the symptoms were observed on treatment plants but not control plants. Lastly the fungus was re-isolated from the affected treatment plants to fulfill Koch‚Äôs postulates.

It was a temporary structure that had to be closed during most rains. The new bridge provides uninterrupted access between Dibang Valley and Lohit valley of Eastern Arunachal Pradesh on Roing-Koron-Paya Road. Lohit valley is the corridor that leads to Kibithu, the battleground of the 1962 Indo-Sino war and Lower Dibang Valley leads to the Anini front of border with China. The bridge reduced traveling time between Tezu and Roing (district headquarters of Lohit Valley and Lower Dibang Valley respectively) from 3 hours to 45 minutes.

The prorogation, or suspension, of Parliament was to be effective from between 9 and 12 September 2019 and last until the State Opening of Parliament on 14 October 2019; in the event, Parliament was suspended between 10 September and 24 September. Since Parliament was to be prorogued for five weeks and reconvene just 17 days before the United Kingdom's scheduled departure from the European Union on 31 October 2019, the move was seen by many opposition politicians and political commentators as a controversial and unconstitutional attempt by the prime minister to avoid parliamentary scrutiny of the Government's Brexit plans in those final weeks leading up to Brexit (withdrawal of the UK from the European Union). Johnson and his Government defended the prorogation of Parliament as a routine political process that ordinarily follows the selection of a new prime minister and would allow the Government to refocus on a legislative agenda. In early September 2019, judges in the High Court of Justice and Outer House of the Court of Session‚Äîthe English and Scottish civil courts of first instance‚Äîruled that the matter was not subject to judicial review as it was a political decision; an appeal in the latter case to the Inner House of the Court of Session‚ÄîScotland's supreme civil court‚Äîoverturned the Outer House verdict and ruled the prorogation was justiciable and unlawful. To resolve the differences of opinion between the courts, both cases were appealed to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which, on 24 September, ruled unanimously in R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland that the prorogation was both justiciable and unlawful; consequently, the Order in Council ordering prorogation was quashed, and the prorogation was deemed \\"null and of no [legal] effect\\". When Parliament resumed on the following day, the prorogation ceremony was expunged from the Journal of the House of Commons and business continued as if the ceremony had never happened. A second much shorter prorogation, this time for six days, began on 8 October. Background Prorogation is a political process which marks the end of a parliamentary session, and also refers to the time between the end of one parliamentary session and the start of another. During prorogation, neither Parliament nor its committees sit, and all motions, unanswered questions, and bills not yet assented to automatically lapse, unless a so-called \\"carry-over motion\\" allows for the business to be resumed in the next session. Prorogation is a power under the royal prerogative and is ordered by the Queen-in-Council; that is, the Queen under advice of the Privy Council. Prorogation takes effect when a royal proclamation which orders the prorogation is read to both Houses of Parliament; at that point, Parliament does not meet again until the State Opening of Parliament some days later.Parliament may be recalled during prorogation for other reasons provided in statute, such as the demise of the Crown (Succession to the Crown Act 1707), if the reserve forces are called into service (Reserve Forces Act 1996), or if emergency powers under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 are exercised. It is distinct from adjournment and recess, which are short breaks that do not halt all parliamentary business, and dissolution, which disperses Parliament in advance of a general election. Since 1854, prorogation has been undertaken by the Lords Commissioners in lieu of the Sovereign.The Royal Commission is typically composed of the Lord Speaker, Leader of the House of Lords, the chairs of the two largest parties not otherwise represented, and the convenor of the crossbench peers. The Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor are also Lords Commissioners, but typically do not participate in Commission business. The Long Parliament, which prevented its own prorogation and reaffirmed the Petition of Right in 1641. Historically, the prorogation of Parliament was the norm; the monarch would typically only summon Parliament to approve royal taxes and summarily prorogue the body again. Prorogation was also used as a royal tactic to avoid parliamentary scrutiny; Elizabeth I suspended Parliament in 1578 to prevent public debate of her courtship with Francis, Duke of Anjou. The turning point came in the prelude to the English Civil War, when Charles I prorogued his third Parliament. Parliament objected to royal imposition of taxes and issued the Petition of Right in response to the King's actions. When then-Speaker of the House of Commons, John Finch, announced the end of the session, incensed MPs sat on Finch, which momentarily prevented the closure of Parliament until the Commons passed several motions which condemned the King's abuse of power. After Parliament was prorogued, Charles I ruled on his own for eleven years‚Äîand even attempted to close down the Parliament of Scotland in 1638‚Äîand only recalled Parliament in 1640 to pass more taxes. The second sitting of Parliament that year‚Äîthe famous Long Parliament‚Äîpassed legislation which prevented its prorogation or dissolution without its consent. In the event, it sat undissolved for another twenty years throughout the English Civil War, Interregnum, and Restoration, despite Pride's Purge in 1648 which created the Rump Parliament and Oliver Cromwell's expulsion of the Long Parliament and convocation of an alternative assembly in 1653. Although prorogation is typically uncontroversial, there have been several noteworthy prorogations during major political disputes. In 1774, upon the advice of Lord North, George III prorogued Parliament after the passage of the Quebec Act, one of the triggers of the American Revolution; in 1831, peers took umbrage to William IV's prorogation of Parliament after the Commons defeated the First Reform Bill which sought to expand the franchise; in 1948, Clement Attlee called a short pro forma session of Parliament, which was prorogued after ten days, to hasten the passage of the Parliament Act 1949; and in 1997, John Major advised an early prorogation prior to the general election in May, at the height of the cash-for-questions affair. The most controversial prorogation of recent times took place in 2008 in Canada; Stephen Harper, the prime minister and leader of the minority Conservative government, advised the governor general, Micha√´lle Jean, to prorogue Parliament prior to the budget. At the time, the Liberal and New Democratic parties planned to form an alternative government with the support of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois; prorogation postponed the motion of no confidence in Harper's government and by the time Parliament sat again, the agreement between the opposition parties fell apart and Harper remained in office. Harper controversially advised Jean to prorogue Parliament again in late 2009, until after the 2010 Winter Olympics; at the time, Harper was under heavy scrutiny for his role in the Afghan detainee affair. A similar crisis that concerned the use of royal powers to break parliamentary deadlock took place in Australia in 1975; the prime minister, Gough Whitlam, was controversially dismissed by the governor-general, John Kerr, and replaced by the leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser, who commanded a majority in the Senate. The House of Representatives, controlled by the Australian Labor Party, passed a motion of no confidence in Fraser, but was unable to reinstall Whitlam before Kerr dissolved Parliament in advance of a federal election.  Prelude  = Under Theresa May = Proposals of prorogation first surfaced in early 2019. At the time, the parliamentary session had been ongoing since 13 June 2017, several days after a general election which saw the governing Conservative Party, then led by Theresa May, lose its majority. Prior to 2010, parliamentary sessions typically started in October and ended in September; general elections would shorten the preceding session and lengthen the following. After the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011‚Äîwhich abrogated the similar royal power to dissolve Parliament‚Äîpassed into law, the regular start of the parliamentary calendar moved to coincide with elections in May. In June 2017, the Government announced the imminent parliamentary session would last for two years, to allow for greater parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit and the repeal or amendment of the corpus of European law which would no longer have effect upon the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union. On 7 May 2019, the 2017‚Äì19 Parliament became the longest parliamentary session since the Long Parliament four centuries prior.Other long parliamentary sessions of note include: the Convention Parliament which followed the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (250 days); the 1893‚Äì94 Parliament, when Gladstone attempted to pass the Second Home Rule Bill (226 days); the 1992‚Äì93 Parliament, when Parliament debated the Maastricht Treaty (240 days); the 1997‚Äì98 Parliament, which passed wide- ranging constitutional reforms (242 days); and the aforementioned 2010‚Äì12 Parliament (295 days). After the Brexit withdrawal agreement negotiated by the Government was rejected by Parliament in the so-called \\"meaningful vote\\", prorogation was seen as an option for the Government to bring the agreement back for another vote; Erskine May, which conventionally codifies parliamentary practice, states \\"matters already decided\\" cannot be brought back during a parliamentary session if they were already rejected on a substantive basis. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, allowed a second vote on the agreement on 12 March 2019, which was rejected with a reduced majority. On 18 March, Bercow said any motion to approve the withdrawal agreement for a vote must not be \\"substantially the same\\", and on 27 March, re-iterated his warning to the Government. A third \\"meaningful vote\\" on the withdrawal agreement, which did not include the \\"political declaration\\" on future EU‚ÄìUK relations, was lost by the Government on 29 March 2019. Contemporaneously, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, previously scheduled for 29 March 2019, was delayed to 12 April 2019. Proponents of leaving the European Union without a deal suggested prorogation as a method to ensure such a departure; the United Kingdom's withdrawal remains the legal default with or without a negotiated withdrawal agreement, and the prorogation of Parliament would prevent legislation to either ratify the agreement, seek an extension to Brexit negotiations, or revoke the invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Prorogation would also prevent a motion of no confidence or a motion to trigger an early general election. After persistent rumours of this course of action, despite Parliament's explicit rejection of a \\"no-deal\\" scenario, opposition MPs took control of the legislative calendar and passed the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019, also known as the \\"Cooper‚ÄìLetwin Bill\\", which mandated the Government to seek a longer extension to Brexit negotiations. A subsequent agreement with the European Council delayed Brexit once again to 31 October 2019 and mandated elections to the European Parliament. After the European elections, in which the Conservatives finished fifth behind the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Labour Party and Green Party, Theresa May announced her intention to resign as prime minister after a new Conservative leader was elected in July. In the interim period, opposition MPs asked whether a new prime minister would use prorogation to reduce parliamentary scrutiny of the Government's Brexit policy, which the Government did not rule out. In response, Bercow said from the chair that \\"Parliament will not be evacuated from the centre stage of the decision-making process on this important matter\\"; he further said such a statement was \\"so blindly obvious so as not to need stating\\" but was dismayed by the fact it needed to be said. = Under Boris Johnson = Boris Johnson, an outspoken critic of the withdrawal agreement, was subsequently elected Conservative leader on 23 July 2019 and became prime minister on the following day. As part of his strategy to ensure, \\"do or die\\", the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 31 October 2019, Johnson's campaign team and political commentators saw prorogation as a viable method to effect the policy. On 18 July, Johnson's imminent victory led opposition MPs to successfully amend the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Bill to make prorogation during late October functionally impossible; the Act requires the Government to lay reports before Parliament, which would then sit to debate them even during the body's suspension. On 25 July, the newly appointed Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who also intimated the possibility of prorogation when he was a backbencher, said the Government viewed prorogation for political purposes as an \\"archaic mechanism\\" which was now his view due to collective ministerial responsibility would not be used. During the summer recess, prorogation was still seen as a likely prospect. At the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Bercow said he would \\"fight with every breath in [his] body\\" to prevent the suspension of Parliament, as he believed Parliament's right to sit and debate was sacrosanct. On 27 August 2019, over 150 cross-party opposition MPs signed the Church House Declaration‚Äînamed after the Headquarters of the Church of England and former temporary parliamentary chamber near Parliament‚Äîand pledged to \\"do whatever is necessary\\" to prevent Parliament being prorogued. Opposition MPs also mooted the traditional conference season recess; in 2019, the conference season started with the Liberal Democrat conference, which began on 14 September, and ends with the closure of Conservative conference on 2 October.  Prorogation  Protestors block Westminster Bridge outside Parliament on 28 August 2019. In the week ending 24 August 2019, it was reported that within the previous 10 days Johnson had asked the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox , for legal advice on the matter of prorogation, tentatively scheduled for between the return of Parliament on 3 September and the European Council meeting on 17 October. On 28 August, Jacob Rees-Mogg, in the role of Lord President of the Council, convened a small Privy Council meeting with Mark Spencer as Chief Whip, Baroness Evans of Bowes Park as Leader of the House of Lords and the Queen whilst she was in residence at Balmoral Castle.The only other reported members of the Privy Council in attendance were the Leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Evans, and the Chief Whip, Mark Spencer. The Queen gave her consent to prorogation, to start on the week beginning 9 September, and end with the State Opening of Parliament on 14 October. Such a long prorogation was seen as unprecedented; since 1979, Parliament has not been prorogued for more than three weeks, and is typically prorogued for less than a week, as opposed to the five-week prorogation requested by the Government. Bercow described the prorogation as a \\"constitutional outrage\\" designed to \\"stop MPs debating Brexit\\". Opposition politicians stated their opposition to prorogation: First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) described Johnson as a \\"tin-pot dictator\\"; First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford (Labour) said Johnson wanted to \\"close the doors on democracy\\"; and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson called prorogation a \\"dangerous and unacceptable course of action\\". Supporters of the Government defended the prorogation; Conservative chairman James Cleverly described prorogation as \\"something all new governments do\\", President of the United States Donald Trump congratulated Johnson, via Twitter, for preventing a motion of no confidence, and former First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster (DUP) welcomed prorogation as an opportunity to review and renegotiate the confidence and supply agreement her party entered into with the Government. Within hours of the announcement, impromptu protests took place in major cities; a demonstration to \\"stop the coup\\" outside Parliament claimed an attendance of several thousand. = Loss of working majority = Upon Parliament's return on 3 September 2019, Conservative MP and \\"no-deal\\" opponent Oliver Letwin made an emergency motion to introduce a bill which sought to delay Brexit past 31 October. The motion would allow backbench control of the timetable for 4 September to pass, in one day, what would become the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Letwin was successful due to the rebellion of 21 Conservative MPs who were subsequently suspended from the party; coupled with the defection of Phillip Lee to the Liberal Democrats, Johnson lost his working majority on his second day in Parliament as prime minister. The Government then attempted to filibuster the bill in the House of Lords to prevent the bill's passage before prorogation; the Government later discontinued the filibuster and allowed the bill to pass the Lords on 6 September, and subsequently receive Royal Assent on 9 September. MPs applaud Bercow as he sets the date for his retirement. After the bill's passage into law, Johnson reiterated his commitment to ensure the UK's withdrawal from the EU took place on 31 October; this sparked speculation he could be imprisoned for contempt of court or otherwise removed from office for failing to uphold the law. The Government also attempted twice to trigger an early general election, on 6 September and 9 September; both attempts failed, as opposition parties refused to support a motion on the basis it would dissolve Parliament and similarly make it unable to prevent a no-deal Brexit. On 9 September 2019, the House of Commons voted 311‚Äì302 for a humble address for a return to force the Government to turn over, within 48 hours, all communications within the Prime Minister's Office related to prorogation as well as publish all documents related to no-deal preparations under Operation Yellowhammer. In Westminster Hall, MPs debated two e-petitions: one supported prorogation and garnered 100,000 signatures before being closed; and one opposed prorogation and garnered signatures in several weeks. On the same day, Bercow announced his resignation as Speaker, effective 31 October 2019, amidst speculation the Conservatives would break the tradition of not standing against the Speaker at the next general election; his resignation beforehand triggered a speakership election in which the Government would find it difficult to install a friendlier Speaker. = Prorogation = Parliament was ostensibly prorogued shortly before on 10 September 2019, when the Lady Usher of the Black Rod, Sarah Clarke, entered the Commons chamber to signal the start of the formal ceremony amidst shouts of protest from the opposition benches. Bercow, who was then surrounded by opposition MPs who held makeshift signs which said \\"silenced\\", derided the intended prorogation as an \\"act of executive fiat\\" before he departed to the House of Lords for the ceremony. As many Conservative MPs followed him out of the chamber, many in opposition heckled the Government with chants of \\"shame on you\\". The ceremony in the Lords was boycotted by opposition peers; this included the Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon and Lord Newby, and caused the procedure to be performed with only three of the Lords Commissioners instead of the usual five. There were only sixteen peers in attendance: thirteen Conservatives, two crossbenchers and one Lord Spiritual. The session closed minutes later; upon his return to the Commons chamber alone, Bercow was cheered by opposition MPs before he read the notice of prorogation, which was later declared to be void.

Fifty-two bills had passed into law; this included eight Brexit-related bills, six budgetary bills, and nine bills related to the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive in 2017.The fifty- two bills passed by Parliament are the forty-eight government-sponsored bills passed before 4 September, the two backbench Brexit bills, and two government bills that were given Royal Assent on 9 September. (, ) At the time it was thought that three bills were carried over into the next session, whereas twelve government bills were not carried over. Notable bills which were said to be dropped as a result of prorogation included a Trade Bill, which was due for \\"ping-pong\\" and ineligible to be carried over; a Fisheries Bill; and bills concerned with animal cruelty, divorce, and domestic violence. The supposed prorogation also cancelled a meeting between Johnson and members of the Liaison Committee which was scheduled for 11 September.  Lower court rulings  During the parliamentary recess in August, a group of 78 parliamentarians, led by SNP justice spokeswoman Joanna Cherry and Brexit opponent Jolyon Maugham , made an application for judicial review to the Outer House of Scotland's highest court, the Court of Session in Edinburgh.Cherry and Maugham's co-litigants were Jo Swinson, Ian Murray, Geraint Davies, Hywel Williams, Heidi Allen, Angela Smith, Peter Hain, Jenny Jones, Janet Royall, Robert Winston, Stewart Wood, Debbie Abrahams, Rushanara Ali, Tonia Antoniazzi, Hannah Bardell, Roberta Blackman-Woods, Ben Bradshaw, Tom Brake, Karen Buck, Ruth Cadbury, Marsha de Cordova, Ronnie Cowan, Neil Coyle, Stella Creasy, Wayne David, Emma Dent Coad, Stephen Doughty, Rosie Duffield, Jonathan Edwards, Paul Farrelly, James Frith, Ruth George, Stephen Gethins, Preet Kaur Gill, Patrick Grady, Kate Green, Lilian Greenwood, John Grogan, Helen Hayes, Wera Hobhouse, Margaret Hodge, Rupa Huq, Ruth Jones, Ged Killen, Peter Kyle, Ben Lake, David Lammy, Clive Lewis, Kerry McCarthy, Stuart McDonald, Anna McMorrin, Carol Monaghan, Madeleine Moon, Layla Moran, Jess Phillips, Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Liz Saville Roberts, Tommy Sheppard, Andy Slaughter, Owen Smith, Chris Stephens, Jo Stevens, Wes Streeting, Paul Sweeney, Gareth Thomas, Alison Thewliss, Stephen Timms, Anna Turley, Catherine West, Matt Western, Martin Whitfield, Philippa Whitford, Paul Williams, Daniel Zeichner, Caroline Lucas, Rosena Allin-Khan and Luciana Berger. The litigants sought a ruling that prorogation to avoid parliamentary scrutiny would be unconstitutional and unlawful; the hearing was expedited to 6 September. Immediately after the announcement of prorogation on 28 August, Cherry applied to the court for an interim interdict to prevent prorogation until the case could be heard; on the same day, Gina Miller, who previously defeated the Government on the use of the royal prerogative in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, made an urgent application for judicial review of the use of prerogative powers at the High Court of Justice for England and Wales in London, and victims' rights activist Raymond McCord made an application at the High Court of Northern Ireland in Belfast which alleged breaches of the Good Friday Agreement. On 30 August, Lord Doherty refused the request in the Scottish case for an interdict as he was not satisfied there was a \\"cogent need\\" for one. During the Court of Session hearings on 3 September, the court heard evidence Johnson had approved negotiations with the Palace on 15 August 2019, by way of signing a handwritten note to his special adviser Nikki da Costa and Dominic Cummings, and made comments about the short sitting of parliament in September being a \\"rigmarole\\" to show MPs were \\"earning their crust\\". Aiden O'Neill , who represented the petitioners at the Court of Session, argued this proved the Government misled the court when they described the issue of prorogation as an academic one. During the proceedings, the Government offered no sworn witness statements which testified to the reasons for prorogation; legal commentator David Allen Green likened the lack of such a statement to Sherlock Holmes's famous quote about \\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\". On 4 September, Doherty ruled in the first instance that the matter was non-justiciable; the case was immediately appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session. Doherty's opinion was shared by the High Court of Justice, who rejected Miller's case on 6 September as non-justiciable. The High Court of Northern Ireland did not rule on the aspect of prorogation in McCord's case‚Äîas the English and Scottish courts had already ruled on the matter‚Äîand found the other aspects on his cases non- justiciable on 12 September. On 11 September, the three-judge appellate panel at the Court of Session, consisting of Lords Carloway (Lord President), Brodie, and Drummond Young, unanimously found the prorogation was unlawful. The court found Johnson was motivated by \\"the improper purpose of stymieing Parliament\\" and had effectively \\"misled the Queen\\", and as a result, declared the royal proclamation as \\"null and of no effect\\". To resolve the fundamental differences in the verdicts from England and Scotland's senior courts, both the Miller and Cherry cases were appealed to the Supreme Court.  Political events during prorogation  After the Scottish judgement was announced, opposition MPs demanded Parliament be immediately recalled that afternoon and some MPs returned to the empty chamber in protest. At the same time, 10 Downing Street reportedly said the petitioners had \\"chosen the Scottish courts for a reason\\". The statement evoked the \\"Enemies of the People\\" newspaper headline after the government lost the 2016 Miller case, and the subsequent controversy over then-Lord Chancellor Liz Truss's apparent failure to defend the independence of the judiciary. In response, incumbent Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland ‚Äîwho several days previously met Johnson to encourage him to not breach the Article 50 extension law‚Äîresponded in defence of the judiciary, and the Prime Minister's Office made a subsequent statement which defended the impartiality of the judges. That evening, Kwasi Kwarteng, a senior minister in the government, reopened the controversy on The Andrew Neil Show when he told Neil \\"many people are saying that the judges are biased\\". = Operation Yellowhammer = That same evening, just before the deadline set by Parliament for the Government to comply with the 9 September humble address, the Government published a summary of the Operation Yellowhammer documents, but refused to publish the full documents or release the prorogation correspondence, on the grounds that doing so would violate the legal right to privacy which civil servants enjoy. Refusal to conform with a humble address, which is binding, risks the Government being found in contempt of Parliament for the second time within a year; in the first instance, Parliament voted in December 2018 that legal professional privilege was not a defence to a charge of contempt, in relation to the Government's initial refusal to disclose the full legal advice it received on the withdrawal agreement. The partial release of the Yellowhammer documents, which detailed possible disruption to the supply of food, fuel, and medicine as a result of a no-deal Brexit, led to renewed calls from the opposition for Parliament on 12 September to be immediately recalled. At the same time, Johnson was scrutinised with regard to the Court of Session finding he had misled the Queen; he denied lying to the Queen and said the High Court of Justice corroborated his belief. On the same day, former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve said that if the Supreme Court found the Government had misled the Queen, it would represent a \\"very serious\\" breach of the relationship between the Queen and her prime minister, and Johnson would be forced to \\"very swiftly\\" resign as a matter of constitutional principle. On 15 September, the Mail on Sunday reported that Cummings, in a meeting with other governmental special advisors, had suggested a second prorogation if the Supreme Court declared the first prorogation unlawful; the Prime Minister's Office confirmed the accuracy of the story and said the comment was \\"clearly made as a joke\\". = Impeachment = On the same day, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said Parliament should impeach Johnson if the Government lost before the Supreme Court and Johnson refused to resign; Liz Saville Roberts, the leader of the party in the House of Commons, had said earlier that week that Johnson should also be impeached if he refused to extend Brexit negotiations and entered discussions with other parties to gather support. Impeachment is an arcane parliamentary procedure which has never been successfully levelled towards a prime minister or a Cabinet minister:Ministers of the Crown were successfully impeached before the introduction of the Cabinet system; for example, Lord Oxford, the penultimate Lord High Treasurer before the office was put into commission and replaced with the office of prime minister, was impeached by the Whigs in 1713 due to his role in negotiating the Treaty of Utrecht. the last individual to be impeached was Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville in 1806; and the last serious attempt was an unsuccessful 2004 effort by Price and ten other MPs to impeach then-prime minister Tony Blair. Johnson, then a member of the opposition frontbench, was another high-profile supporter of the impeachment motion and wrote an opinion piece in The Daily Telegraph which accused Blair of \\"treating Parliament and the public with contempt\\". Historically, individuals who were impeached would be arrested and prosecuted by the Commons in a trial before the Lords in Westminster Hall; those who were later convicted were sentenced at the liberty of the Commons and had no right to receive the royal prerogative of mercy. Supreme Court Press and anti- prorogation protesters assemble outside the Supreme Court on 17 September 2019 The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom began a three-day hearing to consider the appeals for both the London and Edinburgh cases on 17 September 2019; McCord, who did not appeal his ruling, was granted leave to make an oral intervention. On the first day of the hearing, which focused on the losers of each lower court case, the Advocate General for Scotland, Lord Keen, argued that the Government was entitled to prorogue Parliament for political purposes and the Court of Session ruled outside its jurisdiction. When asked by the court whether Johnson would prorogue Parliament for a second time, Keen did not answer. Lord Pannick , who responded on Miller's behalf, argued that there was \\"strong evidence\\" that the purpose of prorogation was to prevent MPs from \\"frustrating\\" the Government's Brexit plans, as opposed to a short prorogation for a Queen's Speech that the respondents \\"had no quarrel with\\". The second day focused on the victors in each lower court case; the Government, represented by James Eadie , argued that in the absence of legislation that regulated the power of prorogation, it was not appropriate for the judiciary to \\"design a set of rules\\" to judge prorogation by; O'Neill argued that although it would not be to appropriate to create such rules, it was nevertheless \\"the province of the courts\\" to decide whether prorogation was constitutional. The final day of the hearing saw interventions from other interested parties: former solicitor general Lord Garnier, who responded for former prime minister John Major, argued prorogation was \\"motivated by a desire to prevent Parliament interfering with the prime minister's policies during that period\\"; the Scottish Government, who were represented by its Lord Advocate, James Wolffe, argued prorogation had a \\"profoundly intrusive effect\\" on Parliament; McCord's advocate Ronan Lavery argued prorogation was designed to \\"run down the clock\\" to force a no-deal Brexit, which would in turn result in controls on the border with Ireland; and in a written submission, the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, said that if the power to prorogue was unchecked, Parliament would be \\"deprived\\" of the ability to \\"perform its constitutional function\\". The hearing ended with the Government and the petitioners summing up their arguments: Keen re-iterated the argument that the courts were constitutionally \\"not properly equipped\\" to decide on matters of high policy; and Pannick requested the court make a declaration that prorogation was unlawful and for Parliament to be recalled as a result. On 24 September, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the prorogation was both justiciable and unlawful, and therefore null and of no effect. The court cited the Case of Proclamations (1611), in which the High Court of Justice asserted its power to test the existence of limits of prerogative powers, in answering the question of justiciability; in the case of prorogation, use of the Royal Prerogative must have respect for the conventions of parliamentary sovereignty and democratic accountability. The court ruled that any prorogation would be unlawful \\"if it has the effect of frustrating or preventing, without reasonable justification, the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions as a legislature\\"; if this is the case, there would be no need to rule on whether the motives of the executive were lawful. The court further ruled that the prorogation of Parliament did have the effect of frustrating Parliament's constitutional functions; the court found that the suspension of Parliament in the prelude to the \\"fundamental [constitutional] change\\" of Brexit had an \\"extreme\\" effect on the \\"fundamentals of democracy\\". The court also found that the Government had not provided a justification for the intended prorogation nor for its length or its effect on the requirement for parliamentary scrutiny of any withdrawal agreement under the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. As a result, the Court quashed the relevant Order in Council, which meant the effect of the royal proclamation of prorogation had the legal effect of \\"a blank piece of paper\\" and reverted the 2017‚Äì19 Parliament into being in session.  Aftermath  = Legal aftermath = As with the Scottish ruling, several opposition parliamentarians returned to the chamber immediately after the ruling was issued; those MPs who had surrounded Bercow with makeshift signs during the prorogation ceremony took selfies with their signs edited to reflect the ruling. In a statement on College Green‚Äînear Parliament and the Supreme Court's seat in the Middlesex Guildhall‚ÄîJohn Bercow announced he had recalled Parliament to sit on the following day from . Prime Minister's Questions was not scheduled for its regular Wednesday midday slot, but Bercow said he would allow urgent questions and applications for emergency debates to be heard. Bercow opened the first sitting of Parliament, on 25 September 2019, with a statement from the chair: he welcomed MPs back to work and informed the House that consequent to the Supreme Court ruling, the record of the prorogation ceremony would be expunged from the Journal of the House of Commons and corrected to reflect the House as adjourned instead, and that the Royal Assent that had been signified to the Parliamentary Buildings (Restoration and Renewal) Act during the ceremony would need to be re-signified. The first item of debate was an urgent question by Cherry to the attorney general; she urged Cox to publish the legal advice he gave to Johnson on the subject of prorogation to avoid him being labelled as a scapegoat for the affair. Cox defended the advice he gave to Johnson as being \\"in good faith\\", and distanced himself from comments from Conservative MPs which attacked the independence of the judiciary: specifically, Rees- Mogg's description of the ruling as a \\"constitutional coup\\". = Political consequences = On the day of the ruling, Johnson was in New York City to give a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, tentatively scheduled for the morning on 25 September. Johnson said that the Government disagreed with the ruling, but would nevertheless abide by it and not seek to prevent Parliament from meeting on the following day. Johnson refused to rule out a second prorogation, and also ruled out his resignation. The Prime Minister's Office confirmed that Johnson's speech would be brought forward to the evening of the 24th to allow Johnson to fly back to Britain in time for the start of the following day's parliamentary sitting. After the ruling, Johnson was criticised by opposition leaders: Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Party was in conference in Brighton at the time, brought forward his keynote speech in which he invited Johnson to \\"consider his position and become the shortest-serving prime minister there's ever been\\"; SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon demanded Johnson's resignation and urged Parliament to table a motion of no confidence if he did not resign; Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said that Johnson \\"wasn't fit to be prime minister\\"; and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called prorogation \\"the worst political decision ever\\" and called on Johnson to fire his adviser Dominic Cummings for suggesting the plan. Johnson's first address to Parliament after returning from New York was on the evening of 25 September. In his address, after he stated his opinion that the Supreme Court was \\"wrong to pronounce on a political question at a time of great national controversy\\", he re-iterated his call for an early general election and offered time in the parliamentary agenda on 26 September for any party who wished to lay a motion of no confidence against him. When asked by MPs whether he would rule out a second prorogation, he refused, and when asked whether he would abide by the law which mandates him to request an extension to Article 50, he said he would not do so; he had earlier described the law as a \\"Surrender Bill\\" or commonly referred to in the media as the Benn Act. Johnson's speech and conduct was criticised by opposition MPs, who alleged his choice of words were fuelling threats of violence against politicians. Labour MP Paula Sherriff said parliamentarians were routinely receiving death threats using language such as \\"surrender\\" and \\"betrayal\\", and asked Johnson to moderate his language, especially in the context of the June 2016 murder of Jo Cox. Johnson prompted heckles of \\"shame\\" when he responded to Sherriff's comments that he \\"had never heard so much humbug in [his] life\\". Sherriff's request for moderated language was repeated by Cox's constituency successor Tracy Brabin; Johnson declined and elicited further anger when he told Brabin that the best way to \\"honour the memory\\" of Cox would be to \\"get Brexit done\\". On 26 September, Bercow made another statement from the chair that he was considering an application by Kenneth Clarke and Harriet Harman‚Äîthe longest serving male and female MPs respectively‚Äîfor a Speaker's Conference to be held to discuss the lack of decorum in contemporary British political culture. Bercow also lambasted the tone of the previous night's debates as the worst he had seen in Parliament since his election as an MP in 1997. Several hours after asking an urgent question on political decorum, Labour MP Jess Phillips told LBC that a man had been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence outside her Birmingham Yardley constituency office; Phillips alleged the man had been attempting to break into the office whilst accusing her of fascism. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson said he deplored any threats of violence, but defended his description of the Article 50 extension law as a \\"Surrender Bill\\" and declined requests to apologise. Later that day, a Government motion for the House of Commons to go into recess for the duration of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester was rejected 289‚Äì306; the defeat represented the seventh successive Government defeat in the House of Commons and continued Johnson's record of not winning a single division since taking office. As a result, the Government scheduled relatively uncontroversial matters for debate for the three days Parliament sat during the conference; this included the cross-party domestic violence bill, which was scheduled for the Wednesday 2 October session. The lack of a conference recess meant that Prime Minister's Questions clashed with the leader's keynote speech at the Conservative conference; Johnson delivered his conference keynote whilst Prime Minister's Questions was deputised by Dominic Raab who faced questions from then Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott making her the first black MP to stand at a dispatch box for PMQs. On 2 October, the Government announced fresh plans to prorogue Parliament for six days, from Tuesday 8 October to Monday 14 October. Proroguing on a Tuesday meant that Johnson would miss Prime Minister's Questions for the third successive Wednesday; at that point his only scheduled question time since becoming prime minister was on 4 September, although Johnson had faced over eight hours of questions in response to ad hoc ministerial statements. The second prorogation ceremony took place on the evening of 8 October, and was attended by 30 MPs who followed Black Rod Sarah Clarke from the Commons to the Lords. The ceremony passed without the protests that had marked the previous attempt at prorogation with opposition leaders in the House of Lords also participating in the proceedings. On this occasion, though Lord Judge was substituted for Lord Hope of Craighead. = 2019 general election and Brexit = The manifesto published by the Conservative Party prior to the 2019 general election, held in December of that year, stated that a newly elected Conservative government would review the broader constitutional relationship between Parliament and the courts, as well as the function of the Royal Prerogative itself, the basis on which prorogation is made. In the election, they won an 80 seat majority and therefore formed the next government.

Richard Lugar defeated incumbent Democratic mayor John J. Barton, becoming the first Republican to be elected mayor of Indianapolis in nearly two-decades. Democrats had long dominated mayoral elections before 1967, having won ten of the thirteen mayoral elections since 1930. No Democrat would subsequently recapture the mayoralty until 1999, largely due to the city-county merger that created the Unigov in 1970 adding the votes of suburban Marion County, which shifted the composition the electorate towards the Republicans. Nominations =Democratic primary= Barton was unsuccessfully challenged by Marion County Democratic Party chairman James W. Beatty. Beatty's challenge to Barton was seen as an act of retribution for Barton seeking to unseat Beatty as chairman the previous year. =Republican primary= A former member of the Indianapolis School Board, earlier that year Lugar had unsuccessfully sought to become President of the but lost by a vote of four to three. Lugar was also the former head of Community Action Against Poverty and an executive at Thomas I. Green & Co. After this, he was convinced by L. Keith Bulen, the chair of the Marion County Republican Committee, to run for mayor. Lugar was also supported by the Republican Action Committee, a group of young Republicans that had organized after the party's losses in the 1964 election cycle in order to challenge control of the party from the party establishment. In the primary, Lugar defeated former mayor Alex M. Clark. General election Lugar made roughly 400 speeches over the course of his candidacy, discussing a wide variety of issues rather than focusing narrowly on a handful of issues. Among effective criticisms he lodged against Barton was criticism of the practice of open-dump burning of refuse (including in wards that had historically been strongly Democratic). He also spoke on issues such as the construction of the highway inner loop, minority demands, and a lack of adequate recreation space. Barton had been a fairly popular incumbent. By the end of the election cycle, it had been widely anticipated that he would be reelected by a narrow margin. Lugar's win was considered to be a political upset. Coinciding municipal elections were also swept by the Republican Party. Republicans took the city council elections with a 6 to 3 majority of seats.

William Bickerstaff or Bickerstaffe ( 18 August 1728 - 26 January 1789) was an English antiquarian, curate and schoolmaster. He was a well known character in his home county of Leicestershire, remembered for his humour and charity, with several of his letters printed posthumously in The Gentleman's Magazine and John Nichols' historical works, because of their perceived quaintness. Bickerstaff is also remembered as a keen local antiquarian, writing articles and letters to fellow antiquarians on his historical researches. Early life William Bickerstaffe was born in August 1728, and baptised at Church of St Mary de Castro, Leicester, on 18 August 1728. He was born as the third child and only son of the glazier and freeman William Bickerstaffe (-1739) and his wife, Hannah (1697-1769), daughter of Mary and Joseph How. On 29 December 1749, in his father's footsteps, he became a freeman of the city of Leicester. Ecclesiastical and educational career On 30 January 1750, Bickerstaffe was made the Under-Usher (i.e. schoolmaster) of the local Free Grammar School. On 23 December 1770, he was ordained deacon and qualified to be a \\"literate person\\"; in 1770, he was licensed to a curacy at Syston. On 22 December the following year, he was made a priest. He worked as a curate for seven years in the Church of St Mary de Castro, subsequently curate for six years in All Saints Church, Leicester. He was described in his obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine as having \\"occasionally been curate at most of the churches in his native town\\", while also having worked in the nearby parishes of Aylestone and Wigston Magna. Later in his life, when struck by his impoverished situation, Bickerstaffe loosed a succession of appeals to local parishes, asking for preferment to recently vacated offices in their churches, as they came available. He never received any preferment in his lifetime, but, posthumously, his case for promotion was taken before the Lord Chancellor, Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow. The judge concluded that he would have been promoted for his dedication to his church duties, if not for his sudden death. These letters where reprinted, both in The Gentleman's Magazine and Nichols' History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester (1795); the editors saw the communications as a curiosities and apparently printed them \\"for their quaintness\\". Character and death Bickerstaffe's was well known among his parishes as a charitable and humorous man. He supported Sunday schools in Leicester and Aylestone with his unpaid labour and charitable donations, even while he was \\"a poor curate, unsupported by private property\\", as he described himself at fifty-eight; Bickerstaffe survived, for most of his life, on his meager schoolmaster's salary of ¬£19 6s, supplemented with the wage of a curate. He used his (admittedly limited) medical knowledge to help the ill in his parishes, and donated the small surplus that came of his wages to local charitable causes. Both John Throsby and John Nichols reproduced satirical or humorous anecdotes of Bickstaffe's in their works. One such anecdote, recorded by Nichols, records an event where the clerk of a dissenting meeting house was tricked into lining out the popularBallad of Chevy Chase, rather than the intended hymn. The same tale was more colourfully, and independently, recorded by composer William Gardiner (1770-1853) in his memoir Music and Friends (1836). Bickerstaffe was also an educated man, and a keen antiquarian. His many contributions to historical research‚Äîwhich constitutes the majority of his written work‚Äîsurvive in his frequent articles for The Gentleman's Magazine, or in letters to fellow antiquarians. Nichols was one such correspondent and later went on to used Bickerstaffe's knowledge of local history in writing his History of Leicester (1795). On 26 January 1789, at the age of sixty-one, William Bickerstaffe died unexpectedly in his sleep; he was reportedly in good health the previous day. In his obituary, he was described as \\"appearing to have expired, as he had always wished, without a struggle or a groan.\\" He was buried three days later, on 29 January, in the churchyard of St Mary de Castro, alongside his parents and two sisters. Following his death, an obituary was published in The Gentleman's Magazine, accompanied by selections from his correspondence.

It can also be found in the text of the Heian period Nihon Ry≈çiki (in the story, Èõ∑„ÅÆÊÜô„ÇíÂæó„Å¶Áîü„Åæ‰ª§„ÇÅ„ÅóÂ≠ê„ÅÆÂº∑„ÅçÂäõÂú®„ÇãÁ∏Å,\\" On a Boy of Great Strength Who Was Born of the Thunder‚Äôs Rejoicing\\"), the Honch≈ç Monzui, among others. In classical y≈çkai drawings such as the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç by Toriyama Sekien, it is depicted as an oni with the appearance of a monk. Concept It was the era of Emperor Bidatsu. In the town of Katawa, Aichi District, Owari Province (now near Furuwatari, Naka-ku, Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture), a certain peasant had a run in with a lightning strike. The lightning spirit (Raijin) who came down with the lightning rapidly changed form into that of a child. As the peasant was about to kill the raijin with a rod, the raijin begged for mercy and said that there would be repayment for sparing its life, that the peasant would be blessed with a strong child like the raijin. The peasant acceded to this request and upon making a boat from kusunoki wood, the raijin went aboard it while watching over the peasant as it lifted into the air, as the raijin went back to the skies on it together with clouds and thunder.Â±±ÊäòÂì≤ÈõÑ„ÄéÁ•û„Å®ÁøÅ„ÅÆÊ∞ë‰øóÂ≠¶„ÄèË¨õË´áÁ§æ„ÄàË¨õË´áÁ§æÂ≠¶Ë°ìÊñáÂ∫´„Äâ„ÄÅ1991Âπ¥„ÄÅ104,105È†Ö„ÄÇ Eventually, the peasant's wife gave birth to what could only be said to be the raijin's heaven-sent child. The child had an abnormal appearance, with snakes around the head and a tail hanging from the back of its head. As the raijin said, this child had enormous strength since birth, and by the age of 10, could boast enough power to win against a famous prince of the royal family in a contest of strength. Later, the child became an attendant at Gang≈ç-ji. Just then, the attendants at the Gang≈ç-ji bell tower began strangely dying almost every night, and there was a rumor that they were killed by an oni. The attendant said they would catch the oni themself and went out to slay the oni. The attendants prepared beforehand to cover the lights in the four corners of the bell tower with a lid so that when the four attendants caught the oni, they would open the lid and see the oni with their own eyes. As they staked out one night at the bell tower, the oni appeared at early dawn, and they caught its hair and were dragged around. The four attendants were so terrified, they fled without opening the lids. When dawn came, the oni had its head hair completely torn off, and ran away. As they followed the blood trail, they eventually arrived at the grave of a ruffian manservant who used to work at Gang≈ç-ji. As it turned out, this manservant's dead spirit turned into and appeared as a demonic spirit. The demonic spirit's head hair then became Gang≈ç-ji's treasure. It is said that the attendant later continued to use this enormous strength and had a tokudo shukke, and became a d≈çj≈ç-h≈çshi (a priest ranking). Tetsuo Yamaori, in a thesis on the true nature of the concepts in old Japanese gods (kami), took note of the worldview in the background of this story. Observing that the first half involved lightning turning into a \\"small child\\" and then immediately ascending back to the sky, and that the latter half had a \\"demonic spirit\\" that would only appear at night and whose true form cannot be checked without getting close to a light, Yamaori notes that this is a clear show of how spiritual beings originally had a very self-concealing nature. Gag≈ç („Åå„Åî„ÅÜ) alt= Old books from the Edo Period note that this Gagoze is the origin of how children would use the word \\"gagoze\\" and \\"gagoji\\" to mean monsters in general, and in fact, \\"gagoze, '\\"gagoji,\\" gangoji,\\" among others, are widely used in Japan among children to mean y≈çkai in general. However, the folklorist Kunio Yanagita denies this supposition and instead posits that this comes from how monsters would say \\"kamou zo\\" (Âí¨„ÇÇ„ÅÜ„Åû, I'll bite ya) as they appear.

The formation runs from Conwy in the north, down to Cardigan Bay in the area around Aberdyfi and Tywyn, though it is not a continuous over this area.

The section between Aberllefenni and Aberangell is the type locality for the formation. North of Corris, towards Bwlch y Groes, the formation gradually thins and ceases entirely at the pass. Just north of Dinas Mawddwy, at Aber Cywarch the exposed shale beds contain thin layers of limestone. The formation appears again to the east of Bwlch y Groes and can be found in thicknesses up to as far east as Welshpool. There is a further outcrop approximately long west of Glyn Ceiriog. There is a further significant layer of the Nod Glas running along the Conwy and Lledr vallies.

Biography Werner was born to an Orthodox Jewish family, the son of Holocaust survivors, and raised in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. Werner started his career as an accountant and then began to invest in real estate with partners from his community in Brooklyn. After bidding on a building that was being sold by the estate of real estate investor Sylvan Lawrence, he found out that he had the right to seek a price reduction but instead committed to the transaction as he had given his word. In 1997, he was rewarded for his integrity by Lawrence's heirs who gave him first rights to a portfolio of four buildings which Werner purchased for $387.5 million and sold his interest for a $7.5 million profit. As one of the buildings (111 Eighth Avenue) was later sold to Google for $1.8 billion, Werner changed his investment strategy and started holding a higher interest (typically 10%) for a longer period. Werner is considered a real estate syndicator following the model pioneered by Harry Helmsley meaning that he makes a bid for a property putting down a large nonrefundable cash down payment and then goes to his investor network to raise the additional money to close the transaction and secure a fee. From 2000 to 2014, Werner purchased $10.6 billion in real estate including the 2003 purchase of 11 Madison Avenue for $673 million. In 2012, Werner partnered with Brooklyn real estate investor Joel Schreiber and purchased One Court Square for $481 million in Long Island City, Queens from Stephen L. Green's SL Green and JPMorgan Asset Management. In 2014, with $2.4 billion in purchases, he was the single largest purchaser of real estate in New York City which included the $1.5 billion purchase of 5 Times Square from Allan V. Rose's AVR Realty and the $900 million purchase of the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building from Hiro Real Estate. His long time investment partner is Mark Karasick who will own and manage the property while Werner earns a transaction fee and maintains his minority interest. In 2019, he paid $500 million for a 40% interest in 237 Park Avenue from Scott Rechler's RXR Realty and Walton Street Capital.

This article describes the history of these programs, including notable sponsors, directors, and voice actors. History Video rights to all the films and TV specials were licensed by Media Home Entertainment and Kartes Video Communications in the 1980s. In the early 1990s, the rights were acquired by Paramount Pictures and the company released all of the TV specials under their Paramount Home Video label. The distribution rights to the TV specials are now with Warner Bros. Television and Warner Home Video, who purchased the rights from Paramount in 2007 and managed by its classic animation division and also its family film and children‚Äôs entertainment label. =1959‚Äì1965: Beginnings= In addition to the strip and numerous books, the Peanuts characters have appeared in animated form on television numerous times. This started when the Ford Motor Company licensed the characters in early 1959 for a series of color television commercials for its automobiles and intros for The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show which they sponsored. While the show ended in 1961, the deal lasted another three years. The ads were animated by Bill Mel√©ndez for Playhouse Pictures, a cartoon studio that had Ford as a client. Schulz and Mel√©ndez became friends, and when producer Lee Mendelson decided to make a two-minute animated sequence for a TV documentary called A Boy Named Charlie Brown in 1963, he brought on Mel√©ndez for the project. =1965‚Äì1971: Early television specials= Before the documentary was completed, the three of them (with help from their sponsor, the Coca-Cola Company) produced their first half-hour animated special, the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning A Charlie Brown Christmas, which was first aired on the CBS network on December 9, 1965. This episode is undoubtedly the most widely recognized of all Peanuts TV specials. This came after Coca-Cola asked Mendelson if he had a Christmas special. He said \\"yes.\\" The next day he called Schulz up and said they were making A Charlie Brown Christmas. The animated version of Peanuts differs in some aspects from the strip. In the strip, adult voices are heard, though conversations are usually only depicted from the children's end. To translate this aspect to the animated medium, the sound of a trombone with a solotone mute (created by Vince Guaraldi played by Dean Hubbard) was used to simulate adult \\"voices.\\" A more significant deviation from the strip was the treatment of Snoopy. In the strip, the dog's thoughts are verbalized in thought balloons; in animation, he is typically mute, his thoughts communicated through growls or laughs (voiced by Bill Mel√©ndez), and pantomime, or by having human characters verbalizing his thoughts for him. These treatments have both been abandoned temporarily in the past. For example, they experimented with teacher dialogue in She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown. The elimination of Snoopy's \\"voice\\" is probably the most controversial aspect of the adaptations, but Schulz apparently approved of the treatment. The success of A Charlie Brown Christmas was the impetus for CBS to air many more prime-time Peanuts specials over the years, beginning with Charlie Brown's All-Stars and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in 1966. In total, more than thirty animated specials were produced. Until his death in 1976, jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi composed musical scores for the specials, in particular, the piece \\"Linus and Lucy\\" which has become popularly known as the signature theme song of the Peanuts franchise. =1971‚Äì1976: Final golden years= The 1971 TV special Play It Again, Charlie Brown was the first time that someone other than Peter Robbins voiced Charlie Brown which in this case was Chris Inglis. The characters voices were slightly deeper than usual. It would be like that for the rest of the TV specials. Starting with A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, Phil Roman would direct the specials. It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown was the last special produced during Vince Guaraldi's lifetime as he died two months before this special aired. It was dedicated to him. =1977‚Äì1981: Post-Guaraldi era= Ed Bogas composed the musical scores of Peanuts television specials 1977 until 1989. Judy Munsen composed the musical scores alongside Ed Bogas from 1977 until 1992. Desir√©e Goyette briefly composed the musical scores on and off during the 1980s. Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown was the first project done after Guaraldi's death. It used the same voice cast as You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown. It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown and What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown! featured Linus & Lucy arrangement's Ed Bogas and Judy Munsen. =1982‚Äì1990: Vignettes and musicals= Starting with A Charlie Brown Celebration, Bill Melendez would direct the specials again. A Charlie Brown Celebration, It's an Adventure, Charlie Brown, and The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show all had vignettes while It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown, You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, and Snoopy!!! The Musical were musicals though there were two songs in Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!. It's the Girl in the Red Truck, Charlie Brown was the only special during this period in which Ed Bogas, Judy Munsen, or Desiree Goyette were not involved in music production with Paul Rodriquez as the composer. The former and latter would stop scoring the specials in 1990. =1990‚Äì2000: Charles M. Schulz's final years= David Benoit redid Vince Guaraldi's musical scores from 1992 until 2006. Since then, various composers have composed the musical scores in more recent productions. By the mid-1990s, the specials' popularity had begun to wane, and CBS showed disinterest in new specials, even rejecting It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown completely. An eight-episode TV miniseries called This is America, Charlie Brown, for instance, was released during a writer's strike. Also, NBC aired You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown in 1994 (the first special not to air on CBS) ten days before Super Bowl XXVIII. Eventually, the last Peanuts specials made during Schulz' lifetime were released direct-to-video, and no new ones were created until after the year 2000 when ABC obtained the rights to the three fall holiday specials. The Nickelodeon cable network re-aired a package of most of the specials produced before 1992, as well as The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show and This Is America, Charlie Brown, under the umbrella title You're on Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown between 1998 and 2000. =2000‚Äìpresent: new specials= Eight Peanuts-based specials have been made posthumously. Of these, three are tributes to Peanuts or other Peanuts specials, and five are completely new specials based on dialogue from the strips and ideas given to ABC by Schulz before his death. He's a Bully, Charlie Brown, was telecast on ABC on November 20, 2006, following a repeat broadcast of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Airing 43 years after the first special, the premiere of He's a Bully, Charlie Brown was watched by nearly 10 million viewers, winning its time slot and beating a Madonna concert special. In the 2010 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, it was announced that a new Peanuts animated special, Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown, would debut in 2011. The special was released on DVD first, on March 29, 2011, and later premiered on Fox, on November 24, 2011. Many of the specials and feature films have also been released on various home video formats over the years. To date, 20 of the specials, the two films A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home, and the miniseries This Is America, Charlie Brown have all been released to DVD. In October 2007, Warner Bros. acquired the Peanuts catalog from Paramount for an undisclosed amount of money. As aforementioned, they now hold the worldwide distribution rights for all Peanuts properties including over 50 television specials‚Äîthese are originally managed by Warner Bros. Television and Warner Bros. Television Animation. Warner has made plans to develop new specials for television as well as the direct to video market, as well as short subjects for digital distribution, and some of these have in fact already been released via the now-defunct Warner Premiere. Paramount, however, still retains the rights to the first four theatrical releases, as the first two movies (A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home) are owned by CBS and distributed for home video through Paramount while CTD distributes for television, and the other two (Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!)) were handled in-house by Paramount, with Trifecta holding TV distribution rights.

It part of the Episcopal Church's Diocese of Olympia (Western Washington). History Epiphany achieved self- supporting status and became a parish church in 1910, and was key to Bishop Keator's effort that year to transform his diocese from missionary to full, independent status in the United States Protestant Episcopal Church, as The Episcopal Church was known in that time. At that moment in Seattle's history, a development boom was underway, because the city was the U.S. port used by gold-seekers en route to and returning from mining country in Alaska and the Canadian Yukon. Seattle's 1900 census showed it had more than doubled its population over the previous decade, reaching a total of 80,671. The following decade saw continued population growth, with a significant percentage of new arrivals being immigrants from Canada, Britain and urban centers in the mid- Atlantic region of the United States, areas with cultural ties to Anglican Christian worship. The congregation's first senior warden ‚Äì its lay leader ‚Äì was a newly arrived young physician, Dr. Chal. P. Bryant, a nephew of New York journalist and author William Cullen Bryant. He and his wife Elizabeth organized their new Seattle neighbors and friends, some of whom were not Episcopalians, first running a children's Sunday school in the back of a Madrona neighborhood grocery store, and then, as a missionary congregation. The parish's first structure, now its chapel, was designed by Seattle architect, Chicago-born Ellsworth Storey, a member of the congregation. It is a City of Seattle Landmark (footnote City of Seattle site). The cornerstone of the Tudor-revival style building was laid July 23, 1911. The land for the building, located adjacent to Seattle's 1903 park-boulevard system, designed by the Olmsted Brothers, was offered to the church at less than half its market value by the neighborhood's developers, Charles L. Denny, a son of original Seattle settlers, Arthur Armstrong and Mary Boren Denny, and his partner, Elbert Blaine, whose wife Minerva underwrote the congregation's rent payment in the neighborhood storefront until the church could be completed. Epiphany was organized at a time of social reform in Seattle, a port city with a heritage of waterfront saloons, transient hotels, and a large section of its downtown generally dedicated to vice. In 1910, women won the right to vote in Washington state, and progressive Seattle citizens quickly launched a campaign to recall the then-mayor, Hiram Gill, who, it was revealed, was a partial owner of what was to be the nation's largest house of prostitution. Epiphany congregation member George W. Dilling was among the leaders of the recall movement and in a special election held in the spring of 1911, Gill was recalled and Dilling elected to replace him. In the following decade, including during WW I, Epiphany's congregation expanded and the church also served the Madrona-Denny Blaine neighborhoods as a community center and polling place. With the return to peacetime, Epiphany continued to be a growing parish, adding a residence also designed by Ellsworth Storey ‚Äì the rectory ‚Äì for the parish clergyman and his family. It was restored and expanded in 1971, and now serves as the parish office. =Epiphany's Growth= In the 1920s, under the clergy leadership of the Rev. George Wieland as rector, Epiphany was an active participant in the expansion of the Episcopal Church in Western Washington. It organized and supported two missions on the eastern shore of Lake Washington ‚Äì now both parishes: St. John's, Kirkland and Emmanuel, Mercer Island. In that era, a long-standing dispute about where the Episcopal Church's diocesan headquarters should be located was resolved. The Rev. Simeon Arthur Huston of San Antonio, Texas, was elected bishop and directed that the church's ‚Äúsee city‚Äù should be moved from Tacoma, which had territorial-era ties to church-sponsoring transcontinental railroad fortunes, to Seattle ‚Äì by then the state's largest city. Epiphany weathered the Great Depression of the 1930s with continuing congregational growth and financial stability that bypassed its nearby sponsoring parish, St. Mark's Church. An ambitious effort by St. Mark's to build the diocesan cathedral collapsed, not to be revived until after World War II. In 1939, Epiphany's popular rector, the Rev. Wieland, was called to become director of Home Missions for the Episcopal Church‚Äôs national office in New York City, but the Epiphany congregation was again fortunate in calling an energetic young cleric, Philadelphia-born Elmer B. Christie, who had been serving in the Southwest Washington lumber town of Hoquiam, and then at St. John's Church at state's capital, Olympia. On the eve of World War II, in 1940, the Rev. Dr. Christie inspired his parishioners to embark on a successful fund-raising campaign to construct a large brick parish hall adjacent to the church, with classrooms, office and assembly room. Whitehouse and Price of Spokane were the architects. The Rev. Dr. Christie's efforts then led Epiphany to purchase adjoining property where a much larger main church, also designed by Whitehouse, was constructed in 1951, as a World War II war memorial. During the 1950s and 1960s, a distinctive ensemble of stained glass windows, created by the Charles J. Connick Studios of Boston, MA were commissioned and installed. The entire campus underwent a significant renovation in 2015 under the direction of LMN Architects and Lease-Crutcher-Lewis, Seattle firms whose principals are members of the congregation. In 1958, after Seattle's voters declined to support funding for kindergartens, Dr. Christie organized an elementary school as part of his church, utilizing its Sunday school classrooms and other facilities on the campus. Epiphany School continued under the auspices of the congregation as a sectarian institution until 1969, when it was reorganized as an independent school, with its campus expanded into the neighboring blocks. Also in 1958 Epiphany again entered missionary work, supporting a new congregation founded in Edmonds, WA, St. David of Wales, in the fast-growing suburbs north of Seattle. Dr. Christie saw this as a fitting way to mark Epiphany Church's 50th anniversary. Epiphany's associate clergyman, the Rev. John Huston, son of Bishop Simeon Arthur Huston was called as the first vicar of St. David's. =Epiphany Church and the Era of Racial Violence in Seattle= During the 1960s and 1970s Epiphany Church and its Madrona-Denny- Blaine neighborhoods found itself on the front lines of racial conflict in Seattle. In 1948, racial and anti-Semitic exclusionary codes in the deeds of most of the homes around Epiphany were ruled unconstitutional, but that had not prevented local banks and real estate agents from redlining Madrona, primarily to exclude African-Americans by refusing to make home loans in areas where residents were not all whites. ‚ÄúWhite flight‚Äù disinvestment followed and growing black militancy impacted the church. In 1968, a Seattle branch of the Black Panther Party was organized by two Madrona brothers, Aaron and Elmer Dixon, in a small storefront office next to the Epiphany Parish thrift shop, Trinkets and Treasures several blocks from the church. When the young Panthers began military-style drills at Madrona Park, Epiphany's volunteers were frightened, and the shop relocated to a small business district on nearby Capitol Hill. In his 2012 memoir, Aaron Dixon described his attitude at that time in the Madrona of his youth as ‚Äúget Whitey,‚Äù acknowledging this clashed with his middle-class parents. In the early 1960s, the Diocese of Olympia attempted to encourage its congregations to welcome African-Americans, closing Church of the Advent, its Central Area mission to Black Seattleites, located not far from Epiphany. Those communicants were urged to join nearby Episcopal congregations, some more welcoming than others. Several of its members transferred to Epiphany, and other people of color soon followed, beginning a new era of multiculturalism within the congregation. In 1968, the Seattle-area struggle to end racial discrimination in housing claimed the life of Edwin Pratt, an African American who was executive director of the Seattle Urban League, where Episcopal Bishop, the Right Rev. Steven F. Bayne was a board member. Pratt and his family, working with a multiracial advocacy group, had moved to a white suburb north of Seattle. He was a communicant at Epiphany's Edmonds mission, St. David of Wales. On a dark night in January, 1969, Pratt answered a call at his residence's door and was fatally shot. His assailant has never been found. The only residential fire-bombings in Seattle during this era occurred within blocks of Epiphany, at the Madrona homes of two high profile, politically-liberal, white men: the area's state senator, and one of its two state representatives, insurance executive, David Sprague, a member of Epiphany's congregation. There were no injuries, but some structural damage to their homes. Both men decided to retire from representing their increasingly non-white district in the state legislature, clearing the way for the election of African-Americans. While the state senator immediately moved to the white suburbs, Sprague and his family remained in Madrona and continued to be inspiring members of the Epiphany congregation. In its determination to foster a spirit of multiculturalism, Epiphany organized a ‚Äúdrop-in‚Äù center for the neighborhood's teens, predominantly African-Americans, staffed by the Central Area Motivation Program, a social service agency located about a mile from Epiphany. =Arson Fire at Epiphany Church= During the decade of the 1970s, for the first time in Seattle's history, its population was in decline. There was a sharp drop in employment at the Boeing Company, located in the region, and white families with school-aged children moved away when the city's public school district voluntarily imposed mandatory busing to address racial imbalance in its classrooms. The 1980 census showed that only increases in college-aged individuals living within the city limits prevented the drop in Seattle's population below 500,000 from being even worse. Despite many strategies, racial segregation in Seattle schools continued, with Madrona's public elementary school's student body having becoming almost entirely black in the 1970s, with the headquarters for the Black Panther Party located a block away. Epiphany neighbor and captain of Seattle's Black Panther chapter, Aaron Dixon, welcomed the declining white population in the neighborhood at that time as politically empowering to the black community. Dixon's 2012 memoir recounted national news magazines Time Magazine and Newsweek in 1969 ranked Seattle as number one for racially-motivated fire bombings among U.S. cities. In spring of 1975, under cover of darkness, arsonists broke in to Epiphany's main sanctuary and set it on fire. A passenger on a passing city bus spotted individuals fleeing, and the fire department was quickly called. No suspects were ever identified. Arson intimidation did not daunt the Epiphany congregation in its determination to remain in what had become a majority non-white neighborhood. Its young rector, the Rev. John ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Gorsuch, Colorado-born, Yale University-educated, had been called to the church upon the retirement of the Rev. Christie in 1968, and continued to lead his congregation forward into multiculturalism. Epiphany's insurance largely funded repairs that were quickly made and services soon resumed in the restored church. =Epiphany Leads in the Ordination of Female Clergy= The growing movement within the Episcopal Church to allow women to be ordained to the priesthood came to a national vote at its General Convention in the summer of 1976 in Los Angeles, CA [link]. The Diocese of Olympia was divided, with its then-bishop, the Right Rev. Robert Hume Cochrane voting against the proposal to allow, but not require bishops to ordain women. The previous year, Epiphany's rector, Father Gorsuch had invited Dr. Laura Fraser, who held a theology doctorate as well as degrees in sociology and philosophy, to join Epiphany's clergy staff. With the national vote, the congregation prepared for her ordination, although it was by no means certain Bishop Cochrane would agree. Although a protest service was conducted at a conservative Episcopal congregation elsewhere in Seattle, Dr. Fraser's high-profile ordination at Epiphany, a subject of extensive news media attention, was conducted at the church, Bishop Cochrane presiding, on February 3, 1977. This was the first female ordination in the Episcopal Church in western Washington and one of the first in the Episcopal Church nationally. =New Directions ‚Äì Social Outreach and Campus Renewal= Father Gorsuch's decision to retire in 1986 was followed by the calling of the Rev. Philip Compton, who due to ill health, soon resigned, and the subsequent arrival of the Rev. Don Goodhart to serve as rector in 1988. He was assisted by two female clergy, both mothers of young children, the Rev. Dorian McGlannan and the Rev. Whitney J. DeVine, who ‚Äújob shared‚Äù ‚Äì a new concept for the congregation. In subsequent years, clergywomen have been integral to the life of Epiphany Parish. Social outreach programs also were developed serving the poor and homeless in Seattle and missions to Central America. Recognizing the need for structural and physical upgrades, the congregation conducted a significant capital campaign in 1997, financing the installation of a new Noak pipe organ, seismic retrofit, construction of columbarium and garden renovations. When an earthquake struck the region in 2001, there was great thankfulness for the seismic improvements that prevented serious damage. Epiphany Today The current rector, the Rev. Doyt Conn, Jr., was called to Epiphany in 2008, and under his leadership there has been significant parish revitalization and expansion. Currently four Sunday services are offered. A preschool was opened and after-school daycare provided, as well a concert series and pilgrimages to sites considered holy in the Christian world.

The Finals featured the top seeded Washington Mystics facing off against the second seed Connecticut Sun. The Washington Mystics defeated the Connecticut Sun through five turbulent games, with the Mystics winning the odd-numbered games and the Sun emerging victorious through the even-numbered games, exploiting a temporary absence of Elena Delle Donne and drawing upon unrelenting resolve to keep the series going, to make their bid for a championship that ultimately failed after the Mystics resurged in Game 5's final quarter. This was the first-ever Finals win for the Washington Mystics, as well as the Connecticut Sun's third Finals appearance. Road to the Finals =Standings= =Playoffs= Summary This finals was the third time in the four years since the WNBA switched playoff formats in 2016 that two teams from the same conference met in the WNBA Finals. In 2016 and 2017, two teams from the Western Conference met. This would be the first time two teams from the Eastern Conference met in the Finals. This Finals is also the third time that the top two seeds have made it to the finals since the WNBA switched playoff formats in 2016. The lone non-top two seed to make the finals was the third seeded Washington Mystics in 2018. The Mystic's home court advantage figured to play a critical role in these finals. The Mystics had a 14‚Äì3 home record during the regular season and the Connecticut Sun had a 15‚Äì2 regular season home record. However, the Mystics had and regular season away record advantage 12‚Äì5 vs. 8‚Äì9. The Sun won the regular season series 2‚Äì1, with the home team winning each game. =Game 1= Ariel Atkins turned around her recent poor form to lead the Mystics to a win in Game 1 of the Finals. Atkins was 5‚Äì21 during the Mystic's semifinal series, but scored 21 points in Game 1 of the Finals on 6‚Äì7 shooting. Additionally, Elena Delle Donne and Emma Meesseman played for the Mystics. This was a change from the regular season series, where both players did not play. Delle Donne in particular made her presence felt, leading the Mystics with twenty-two points and ten rebounds. The Sun got a big performance from Courtney Williams, who scored a game high twenty-six points. However, the Sun's bench contributed only eight total points, while the Mystic's bench scored sixteen. =Game 2= Elena Delle Donne only played 3:20 of the first quarter before experiencing back spasms that saw her miss the remainder of the game. The Sun took advantage of the League MVP's absence and won Game Two by twelve points. The Sun were led by Jonquel Jones who achieved the WNBA Finals' first ever thirty point and fifteen rebound game. Jones finished with thirty-two points and eighteen rebounds. The Mystics were able to tie the score at seventy-six, with eight minutes remaining, but Jones re-entered the game after sitting on the bench with four fouls. She returned to the game and helped the Sun finish off the win. With the series tied at one game apiece, the series heads to Connecticut for the next two games. The Sun now have home court advantage in the series. =Game 3= Elena Delle Donne played through her herniated disk and contributed 13 points in the Mystics road win. Washington got out to a hot start, going up fifteen points in the first quarter. They then took a five point lead into halftime and never looked back, winning by thirteen points. Their road win brings them within one game of the WNBA Championship. The Mystics had four players score in double figures, with two reaching over twenty points. The Sun also had four players score in double figures, but none reached the twenty point mark. =Game 4= The Sun stormed out to a fifteen point lead in the first quarter and held off a late Mystics charge to win Game 4, and force a deciding Game 5. The Mystics made a run after halftime, winning the third quarter by sixteen points, and tying the game going into the fourth quarter, but it was not enough to overcome the Sun. Alyssa Thomas starred for the Sun, coming within two rebounds of the first WNBA Finals triple double. Jonquel Jones also recorded a double double for the Sun. The Mystics lead by five at one point in the fourth, but the Sun hit two three pointers to gain the lead for good with 2:22 left. Connecticut went four for four on free throws in the last minute to seal the game. =Game 5= Game five was a tight affair in the first half, with the Sun taking a one point lead into half time. The game continued to be close in the third quarter. The Sun took a two point lead into the final period. However, season MVP Elena Delle Donne scored four of her twenty-one points during an 8‚Äì0 run with three minutes left to seal the win for the Mystics. The Mystics won the fourth quarter by thirteen points, and the game by eleven. The win secured the Mystic's their first title in franchise history, and leaves the Sun still looking for their franchise's first title. Emma Meesseman lead the Mystics in scoring, with twenty two points. She was named the Finals MVP and became the first bench player to win the award. Jonquel Jones lead the Sun with twenty-five points and Alyssa Thomas had twenty-one points and twelve rebounds, but it was not enough to overcome the Mystics.

It was set up to increase the number of women in employment which would release men to join the armed forces. It also had a \\"semi-military\\" section that trained women in marksmanship and military drill for home defence purposes. The corps was supported by the Board of Agriculture for a period, though it would be eclipsed by the more successful Women's Land Army.  Foundation  The Women's Defence Relief Corps was founded by Mrs Dawson Scott in September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. It was initially intended to increase the employment of women, which would release men to join the British armed forces (which did not introduce conscription until 1916). The organisation was supported by Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener (Secretary of State for War) and Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts (president of the Women's Rifle Associations). It expanded to two divisions: the civil section which focused on the original aim of women's employment and a \\"Semi-Military or good-citizen section\\". The latter division was a paramilitary of women who wanted to \\"defend not only herself, but also those dear to her\\". The semi-military section was set up after women were refused training by the official home defence units. The section drilled along military lines and trained women in marching, scouting and marksmanship. An official handbook for the corps was produced under the editorship of Mrs Scott; its 3rd edition was published in 1915. Women of the corps were issued a brown cloth brassard marked with a red letter H.  War work  The corps mobilised to carry our agricultural work in spring 1915. It would go on to play a key role in putting farmers in touch with casual female labour. The corps advertised the available posts as suitable vacation work for women and stipulated a minimum wage of 18 shillings per week. The Women's Land Army developed from the corps in 1915, as a means of alleviating food shortages. By the war's end the land army would have sent out 9,022 female labourers and was instrumental in saving the 1918 British flax harvest. The Women's Defence Relief Corps was a more modest organisation which by 1916 was sending out work teams totalling just 465 women. These focused on light agricultural work such as fruit picking, hop harvesting and hay making. Whilst the corps was viewed as unsuccessful in making a significant impact the Board of Agriculture took an interest, as it was keen to use it to increase the use of middle-class women in supervisory agricultural positions. By the end of 1916 the number of women in the corps had been increased to 2,000. The Board of Agriculture decided that a widespread reorganisation of female volunteer labour was needed and from March 1917 directed its efforts solely on the Women's Land Army.

In spite of her lack of formal schooling, she was accepted to study at Newnham Hall (now Newnham College), Cambridge, in 1879 becoming the first woman to pass the moral sciences tripos examination with first class honours. She lectured at the college, and remained associated with it for many years. She was a strong campaigner for women's access to university education on equal terms to men, and for women's suffrage generally, and was an active member of the Ladies Dining Society, a select group of Cambridge women of similar views. From 1905 she acted as honorary secretary for the Cambridge branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and its successor the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship. Her 1908 play Man and Woman became a popular fundraiser with local suffrage societies. Her husband was James Ward, Cambridge Professor of Mental Philosophy and Logic. Early life Mary Martin, the third of twelve children of a Congregationalist minister, was born in Armagh, Ireland, on 6 June 1851. She was educated at home by her mother, there being little money for a girl's schooling since her mother's family wealth had been entailed to the male heirs. When she was fifteen the family moved to Royston in Hertfordshire, and Mary became a pupil-teacher for a year at a school in Hampstead, after which she continued to educate herself while working as a governess. In the mid-1870s her older brother the Cambridge physiologist Henry Newell Martin offered to support her studies at Cambridge if she could win a scholarship in the Higher Local Examination, which she did. In 1876, as Newell moved to take up the first chair of physiology at Johns Hopkins University, Mary began her studies at the newly-founded Newnham Hall (later Newnham College). At age 25 ‚ÄòMinnie‚Äô, as she was known to her friends, was described as looking young for her age, delicately pretty, gay, eager and shy. Cambridge As a Cambridge student, Martin involved herself in issues of female education, campaigning for women to have access to university education on equal terms to men, and to be admitted as of right to the university's tripos examinations. In 1879 she took her final examinations in the moral sciences tripos, passing with first class honours, the first woman ever to do so. From 1880 she became resident lecturer in moral sciences at Newnham College. During the early 1880s, Martin attended a series of lectures given by James Ward, a fellow of Trinity College (later to become Professor of Mental Philosophy and Logic) who was also a strong supporter of women's education. Mary and James married in Nottingham on 31 July 1884 and they settled in Cambridge, in a house built for them by JJ Stevenson. They went on to have two daughters and a son. It was said of Mary Ward (as she then became) that her \\"quick Irish speech bubbled out when she was excited. Life was full of the urge of things to fight for\\".Quoted in Kennedy Smith 2018a She was an enthusiast for the equality of the sexes, devoting much time to her work for the suffrage movement. She had clear-cut opinions on many subjects, which she could express trenchantly, especially on the suffering of human and animal life. From 1890 until its dissolution in 1914 she was a member of the Ladies Dining Society, an exclusive women's activist discussion group that had been established by Kathleen Lyttelton and Louise Creighton, both of whom were also wives of Cambridge academics. She continued her association with Newnham College after her marriage, becoming a member of the college council from 1890. She also contributed political sketches to Punch and short articles on metaphysics to the philosophy journal Mind. In 1905 Ward became Honorary Secretary of the Cambridge Women's Suffrage Association (CWSA) ‚Äì an affiliate organisation to the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) ‚Äì a role she held until 1915. By 1909 meetings were being held at her home. In April 1908 her two-act play Man and Woman was performed in a hall in Shepherd's Bush, London, the suffrage newspaper Votes for Women noting that it was \\"sometimes quite lively and amusing\\". Ward had the play printed in 1911, and supplied copies to suffragist societies on a sale or return basis, with royalties and profits going to the suffragist cause. It became popular over the next few years, a single 1911 performance making a profit of ¬£10 for an organisation that Ward helped to found: the Eastern Counties Federation of the NUWSS. The play featured an idealistic protagonist, Helen Chester, who persuades a doubting woman that voting is worthwhile. Ward disagreed with the violent tactics that were being introduced by the suffragettes, and in May 1913 she co-signed a letter with Margaret Heitland protesting against the continuing emphasis in the popular press on the militant actions of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), noting that the Union \\"has always condemned every form of violence\\". She also disapproved of the way in which the government was treating militant female prisoners, and she resigned her membership of the Liberal Party in protest. In 1913 she joined the NUWSS Great Pilgrimage, leading a Cambridge group on the march to London. Ward ran a soup kitchen in Cambridge during the Great War. Noting the large number of unemployed Belgian refugees, she devised, ran, and raised funds for a project known as the 'Belgian Soldiers' Comfort Fund' whereby Belgian refugee women would make garments for the troops. It was reported that some 6500 garments were despatched from her own house, each of them bearing a woven tape to say it was a gift from England made by Belgian refugee women. In 1918 Ward became honorary secretary to the Cambridge branch of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, the successor to the NUWSS, a position she held until 1923. Liverpool After the death of her husband in 1925, Ward left Cambridge and moved to live with her daughter in Caldy near Liverpool. There she wrote Memories of Kenneth Martin Ward to commemorate her son, professor of physics at University College, Rangoon, who died in 1927 aged 39. Death Ward died on 14 March 1933 at her daughter's home in Caldy, aged 81. Select publications * \\"On the birth of Olwen\\" (poem, 1890).
