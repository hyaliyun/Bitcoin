It is called thus because the water generally seeps into the sand, and is stored below, sometimes as part of an ephemeral river or creek. Aboriginal water source Soakages were traditionally important sources of water for Aboriginal Australians in the desert, being the most dependable source in times of drought in Australia. Aboriginal peoples would scoop out the sand or mud using a coolamon or woomera, often to a depth of several metres, until clean water gathered in the base of the hole. Knowing the precise location of each soakage was extremely valuable knowledge. It is also sometimes called a native well. Anthropologist Donald Thomson wrote: :For a white man the difficulty in this country is that there is no way in which he can find the wells and soaks unless he does so by chance, and certainly nothing to indicate that the well is there, nor as a rule, even when the terrain and at least its superficial geological formation, the lie of the country, is examined, is there anything to explain the presence of water when he does find it ... :A lifetime of experience, backed by the traditional knowledge that is handed down from generation to generation, enables these people [the Pintupi in this instance] to judge, without having to visit a well that they know, whether it will still contain water and whether, if dry, with the sides fallen in and the well full of debris, it is worth cleaning out.Thomson, Donald, Bindibu Country, Nelson Publishing, Melbourne, 1975. =Cleaning and maintaining the well= Wells were covered to keep them free from fouling by animals. This involved blocking the well with dead branches and uprooted trees. When the wells fell into disrepair, people would bail the well, using the coolamon to throw slush against the wall. This would set like a cement wash and help to hold loose sand, preventing it from falling into the water. Wells could be up to fifteen feet deep, with small toe holds cut into the walls. Recording well locations Donald Thomson writes: :Just before we left, the old men recited to me the names of more than fifty waters ‚Äì wells, rockholes and claypans ... this, in an area that the early explorers believed to be almost waterless, and where all but a few were, in 1957, still unknown to the white man. And on the eve of our going, Tjappanongo (Tjapanangka) produced spear-throwers, on the backs of which were designs deeply incised, more or less geometric in form. Sometimes with a stick, or with his finger, he would point to each well or rock hole in turn and recite its name, waiting for me to repeat it after him. Each time, the group of old men listened intently and grunted in approval ‚Äì \\"Eh!\\" ‚Äì or repeated the name again and listened once more. This process continued with the name of each water until they were satisfied with my pronunciation, when they would pass on to the next. :I realized that here was the most important discovery of the expedition ‚Äì that what Tjappanongo and the old men had shown me was really a map, highly conventionalized, like the works on a \\"message\\" or \\"letter\\" stick of the Aborigines, of the waters of the vast terrain over which the Bindibu hunted.Thomson, Donald F., \\"The Bindibu Expedition: exploration among the desert Aborigines of Western Australia\\", The Geographical Journal, vol. 128, part 1 (March 1962), pp. 1‚Äì14, [143]‚Äì157, 262-278. [Q 306.0899915 THO] White explorers and the wells In the nineteenth century, both Warburton and Carnegie recorded that they had run down Aboriginal residents with camels and captured and chained them to compel them to reveal their secret sources of water. This action left a lasting impression on Aboriginal residents of desert regions, who would have handed accounts of this down through successive generations. In the 1930s, when H. H. Finlayson made his journeys through the desert by camel, he noted that a gelded male camel, after a hard three-and-a-half-day journey in intense heat without water, drank by actual measure without stopping, and fifteen minutes later, another . This sheds light on the resentment built up among the Aboriginal population against explorers for the exploitation and, by enlarging well entrances and digging out springs, the devastation of their precious water supplies to satisfy camel teams. Don McLeod also tells a story of clashes over soak water at the time of the gold rushes in Western Australia: :During the time of the Laverton rush, the Blackfellows tried to keep their meager water supplies hidden from the knowledge of white prospectors since their horses and camels quickly exhausted the limited soaks. McLeod relates a story told to him by an old prospector by the name of Long, observing an Aboriginal man and woman: :The man took the throwing stick he was carrying and worked it into the sand. He then broke off a hollow reed and, placing it in the hole he had thus developed, lay down on his stomach and appeared to suck up something through the reed. His companion repeated his movements before they quietly moved on... :Without delay Long, with the aid of a shovel, proved the existence of a soak of sweet water, from which he replenished his supplies...Only a few days later in the same place, another prospector had the same Blackfellow bailed up, threatening to shoot him unless he revealed a source of water. This was certainly not an untypical bush encounter. However, [they were] interrupted by yet another prospector riding a camel. The Blackfellow took advantage of the confusion and threw a spear into the bush and escaped. :On the diggings, a hue and cry was raised over this alleged murderous attack and a party was quickly organised to set out and teach the Blackfellows a lesson - for daring to protect their water. Mustering what guns they could, the punitive party went out to what later became known as Skull Creek, and shot every Blackfellow they could find. The bodies were buried in shallow graves.Don McLeod, How the West was Lost, self-published, Port Hedland, 1984, pp27-28 See also * Bindibu Expedition * Canning Stock Route * Claypan * Groundwater * Waterhole * Soak dike References External links * Us Mob - Finding water in the desert Category:Geography of Australia Category:History of Indigenous Australians Category:Australian Aboriginal bushcraft Category:Australian English Category:Water Category:Hydrology Category:Aquifers Category:Water wells Category:Exploration of Western Australia Category:Agriculture in Australia Category:Water supply and sanitation in Australia ","title":"Soakage (source of water)"},{"id":"7685679","title":"Guo Wei"},{"id":"7685690","text":"Fullers Group Limited, trading as Fullers360, is a ferry and tourism company in Auckland, New Zealand. It operates in the Hauraki Gulf and Waitemata Harbour. Fullers Group is the latest in a long line of almost continuous harbour and gulf ferry operations based in Auckland since the 1870s. History George Hudson, and his son, Douglas, conceived an idea for an improved ferry operator to replace the neglected Auckland ferry services during a sailing trip on Waitemata Harbour in 1981. By the end of that year, the Hudson family acquired North Shore Ferries (from Leo Dromgoole), another ferry company in Auckland and renaming it the Devonport Steam Ferry Group (which Gulf Ferries Ltd was a part of) (To celebrate the name of the company founded by Ewen W.Allison nearly 100 years before). However, the difficulties and hardships of rejuvenating a failing fleet became apparent almost immediately, as within six weeks of the takeover, every vessel was out of service, except for the Glen Rosa, a small Launch (boat). The transition to a modern operation began in 1987 with the arrival of the Quickcat, Gulf Ferries first catamaran. Creating a faster, more efficient ferry service to Waiheke Island and other destinations. This was continued with the Kea (Built by WECO in Whangarei) being introduced in 1988 to operate the Auckland City to Devonport service. For the tourism services, two new catamaran ferries from World Heritage Cruises, Adventurer and Wanderer, were purchased in 2006 and 2007 for NZ$3 million and NZ$2 million respectively. These vessels will also assist on the company's main ferry routes during peak hours. In 1988, South Pacific Travel Holdings Ltd became shareholders before the publicly listed Fullers Corporation Ltd went into receivership. Recognizing the value of the \\"Fullers\\" brand, the company amalgamated its operations and changed its name to Fullers Group Limited. Stagecoach New Zealand became the major shareholder of Fullers Group Limited but kept George Hudson as chairman until 2007 where his son, Douglas Hudson became the CEO until 2017 when Mike Horne took over the position. In 2009, Brian Souter acquired the company as well as another ferry company, 360 Discovery Limited. Both are now part of the InMotion Group. In 2018 Fullers and 360 Discovery decided to merge brands to become a more cohesive and consumer-friendly ferry operator creating Fullers360.

He succeeded his uncle-in-law Guo Wei, whose surname he had adopted. Emperor Shizong is considered a highly successful emperor of the Five Dynasties period. He centralized military power by his reforms, and proved his military prowess by a series of victories against Northern Han, Later Shu, Southern Tang, and the Liao Dynasty. Although his accomplishments were limited due to his premature death, they paved way for Chinese reunification later completed by the Song Dynasty, founded by his trusted general Zhao Kuangyin. Early life Chai Rong was born in Xingzhou (ÈÇ¢Â∑û; modern Xingtai, Hebei). As a child he came to live with his aunt ‚Äî a younger sister of his father Chai Shouli () ‚Äî and her husband Guo Wei, an official in the Later Tang military. The Guos had no sons, so they adopted the quiet nephew as their own. The youngster grew up into a muscular young man skilled at mounted archery, while also possessing a basic understanding of Chinese classics, history, and the Huang-Lao philosophy. Career under Later Han After the establishment of the Later Han in 947, the Guo family's condition improved dramatically. Guo Wei became the commissioner of military affairs () in 948, and his adopted son became the left commandant for palace-gate security (). On 4 May 950, Guo was promoted to military governor of Tianxiong Command () and delegated to garrison at Weizhou (È≠èÂ∑û; modern Linzhang County, Hebei) at the Later Han-Liao Dynasty border to prevent a possible Liao incursion. Ten days later, his adopted son was appointed Tianxiong Command's chief director of military headquarters () to follow him in Weizhou. Chai Rong ‚Äî by now known as Guo Rong ‚Äî was also given a nominal post of prefect of Guizhou ().Guizhou (Ë≤¥Â∑û; modern Guigang, Guangxi) was then under Southern Han's and not Later Han's direct control. In 950, the Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou unexpectedly killed the entire family of Guo Wei as a plot to liquidate the most powerful ministers in his nation. Guo Wei decided to rebel. As Guo Rong's wife Lady Liu () and children including 3 young sons also remained in the capital Bianzhou (Ê±¥Â∑û; today's Kaifeng, Henan), they were all slaughtered as well. Guo Wei asked Guo Rong to stay behind at the frontier as he led his main army southbound towards Bianzhou. Career under Emperor Taizu of Later Zhou In a few months, Liu Chengyou was killed, Later Han was terminated, as Guo Wei founded the Later Zhou. Guo Rong became the military governor of Zhenning Command () and went to Chanzhou (Êæ∂Â∑û; today's Qingfeng County, Henan). At Chanzhou, he quickly eradicated militarized outlaws in the region and promoted literati to enforce laws more effectively, winning the support of the people. He also initiated projects to tear down dilapidated street walls and build new public office buildings and residential housings. Chancellor Wang Jun, the most powerful minister, did not see eye-to-eye with Guo Rong on some issues and prevented him from visiting the capital on more than one occasion. In 952, Guo Rong requested permission to lead an army to quell a rebellion, but Wang Jun vetoed it for fear that Guo Rong would hold too much military power. At the end, Guo Wei had to personally lead the troops as an emperor. It was not until Wang's banishment in early 953 that Guo Rong finally got a chance to come back to the capital, when in April 953 he was named Prince of Jin (). By this time he was again married, to a Lady Fu, a widowed daughter of general Fu Yanqing. His son Chai Zongxun was born in late 953 in Chanzhou. Emperor of Later Zhou Guo Rong (posthumously known as Shizong of Later Zhou) became emperor in 954 upon his adoptive father‚Äôs death. Like his father, he was considered an able ruler. He continued reforms introduced by his father. More importantly, he began putting pressure on the Northern Han and even the Liao Dynasty, though nothing substantial came of it. More success was met in the south as some minor successes were made against the Southern Tang and Later Shu, paving the way to eventual unification by the Song Dynasty. = Campaign against Liu Chong = One month after Chai Rong took the throne, Liu Chong, Emperor of Northern Han, colluded with Liao Dynasty to launch an assault on Later Zhou. Against the advice of Minister Feng Dao, Chai Rong decided to lead the army to fight against the incursion. When Chai Rong engaged Liu Chong at Gao Ping (in modern Jincheng), two of Chai's general Fan Aineng, He Hui fled from battlefield along with their troops. At this critical moment, Chai Rong risked his life to break through the defense and crushed Liu‚Äôs forces. After this campaign, Chai Rong consolidated his power. He suffered an early death at the age of 38 when he died from illness while out on the field in 959. He left behind him a six-year-old heir to succeed him. This led to the fall of the dynasty and the rise of the Song Dynasty, which eventually succeeded in reunifying China.

Doyle managed Shels from the end of the 1956/57 season, having taken over from Eddie Gannon, to October 1965. He managed Shels again from the start of the 1967/68 season to September 1975 and was succeeded by Tommy Carroll. Doyle's first spell as Shels manager was a successful one. He promoted a number of the club's 1959 FAI Youth Cup winning team to the first team and his decision was rewarded the following season as Shels claimed the FAI Cup for the second time. The league title would be won in a play-off against Cork Hibernians in 1962 and the FAI Cup was won again in 1963. Doyle also took the first ever Shels team into Europe when they played Sporting Clube de Portugal in the European Cup in 1962/63. It was a huge step up for Shels as was the following year's clash in the Cup Winners' Cup against Barcelona, but the experience was to stand Doyle's team in good stead and they knocked Portuguese side Belenenses out of the Fairs Cup in 1964. He became Dundalk F.C. manager in April 1965 . After one season at Oriel Park he moved to St Patrick's Athletic in June 1966 .

Born in Bishop Auckland, Smith studied at the University of Durham and the University of London,The Labour Who's Who 1927, p.201 then trained as a school teacher, and later worked as a tutor for the Workers' Educational Association. During World War I, he served in The Royal Army Medical Corps as a Stretcher Bearer and received the Military Medal. During World War II Smith taught history at Huntingdon Grammar School. Smith was a Labour Party and Independent Labour Party (ILP) parliamentary candidate for Dulwich in 1924 and 1929 and in New Forest and Christchurch in 1932. In 1933, he attended a conference of left socialists, organised by the ILP. Following its conclusion, Smith and John Paton travelled to meet Trotsky. After this meeting, he argued broadly in favour of the Fourth International until at least 1935. In 1939, he succeeded James Maxton as Chairman of the ILP. World War II began the same year, and the ILP opposed it, but in 1941 Smith surprised the party by announcing that he supported the prosecution of the war. As such, he resigned both from the ILP and his role as chair. Shortly afterwards, he joined the Common Wealth Party as its Research Officer, and in 1944 he succeeded Kim Mackay as the party chairman. With the onset of the Cold War, Smith became increasingly anti-communist, and increasingly a proponent of Zionism. Unable to gain support in Common Wealth for his ideas, he left in 1948. Smith began working with a range of anti-communists, including Jack Tanner of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Duchess of Atholl (founder of the British League for European Freedom) and Conservative Party MP Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton, founding Common Cause in 1951, which aimed to combat communism in the trade unions. He soon became its general secretary, but the group dissolved itself into Industrial Research and Information Services in 1956.

It is named after German mathematician Herbert Gr√∂tzsch. The Gr√∂tzsch graph is a member of an infinite sequence of triangle-free graphs, each the Mycielskian of the previous graph in the sequence, starting from the null graph; this sequence of graphs was used by to show that there exist triangle- free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number. Therefore, the Gr√∂tzsch graph is sometimes also called the Mycielski graph or the Mycielski‚ÄìGr√∂tzsch graph. Unlike later graphs in this sequence, the Gr√∂tzsch graph is the smallest triangle-free graph with its chromatic number . Properties The full automorphism group of the Gr√∂tzsch graph is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5 of order 10, the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon, including both rotations and reflections. The characteristic polynomial of the Gr√∂tzsch graph is :-(x-1)^5 (x^2-x-10) (x^2+3 x+1)^2.\\\\ Applications The existence of the Gr√∂tzsch graph demonstrates that the assumption of planarity is necessary in Gr√∂tzsch's theorem that every triangle-free planar graph is 3-colorable. used a modified version of the Gr√∂tzsch graph to disprove a conjecture of on the chromatic number of triangle-free graphs with high degree. H√§ggkvist's modification consists of replacing each of the five degree-four vertices of the Gr√∂tzsch graph by a set of three vertices, replacing each of the five degree-three vertices of the Gr√∂tzsch graph by a set of two vertices, and replacing the remaining degree-five vertex of the Gr√∂tzsch graph by a set of four vertices. Two vertices in this expanded graph are connected by an edge if they correspond to vertices connected by an edge in the Gr√∂tzsch graph. The result of H√§ggkvist's construction is a 10-regular triangle-free graph with 29 vertices and chromatic number 4, disproving the conjecture that there is no 4-chromatic triangle-free n-vertex graph in which each vertex has more than n/3 neighbours. Related graphs The Gr√∂tzsch graph shares several properties with the Clebsch graph, a distance-transitive graph with 16 vertices and 40 edges: both the Gr√∂tzsch graph and the Clebsch graph are triangle-free and four-chromatic, and neither of them has any six- vertex induced paths. These properties are close to being enough to characterize these graphs: the Gr√∂tzsch graph is an induced subgraph of the Clebsch graph, and every triangle-free four-chromatic P_6-free graph is likewise an induced subgraph of the Clebsch graph that in turn contains the Gr√∂tzsch graph as an induced subgraph . The Chv√°tal graph is another small triangle-free 4-chromatic graph. However, unlike the Gr√∂tzsch graph and the Clebsch graph, the Chv√°tal graph has a six-vertex induced path.

A sequel, Spookley and the Christmas Kittens, was released in December 6, 2019 on Disney Junior. Plot Two bats who live at Holiday Hill Farm, bug-eating Boris and bug-loving vegetarian Bella, discover an unusual sight in the pumpkin patch and rush to inform the farm's scarecrow, Jack, of their find: a young, innocent and square pumpkin, who identifies himself as Spookley. Jack takes a liking to Spookley, but Little Tom, a small pumpkin attached by a vine to the much larger Big Tom, immediately begins bullying Spookley and says only round pumpkins are real pumpkins. Jack quickly puts a stop to Little Tom's teasing. Jack organizes the pumpkins in the patch to compete in the 'Jack-a-Lympics' contest, an athletic competition (\\"not affiliated in any way, shape or form with... those other games\\") designed to determine the \\"Pick of the Patch.\\" Three spiders, who show sympathy for Spookley, decide to help him in the Jack-a-Lympics just so they can help themselves to the prize, a crown made of candy corn. Throughout the competition, Big Tom and Little Tom are repeatedly disqualified for using their vine to give them an unfair advantage, leaving third-place finisher Bobo, a vain female pumpkin, to win most of the events. Spookley turns out to be a total failure at all the events, leaving him discouraged. As Bobo is crowned the winner and the spiders abandon Spookley to help themselves to her crown, a severe wind storm hits the pumpkin patch, pushing the pumpkins all over and pinning Jack under a flaming tree branch. Spookley, because he is square, does not roll away when the wind hits him (unlike the other pumpkins) and, through some moments of ingenuity, rescues Jack from being burned alive and his fellow pumpkins from being washed away in the river. The other pumpkins show gratitude for saving them. After the storm, the farmer goes into the patch to assess the damage and discovers Spookley. The farmer is charmed by Spookley's square shape and decides to make the square pumpkin his own personal jack-o'-lantern. The Honeydoos, three singing honeydews who sing in the style of The Pointer Sisters, are also featured. Bobby Pickett makes a brief cameo near the end of the film; his hit song \\"Monster Mash\\" is mentioned in one of the musical numbers \\"Transylvania Twist\\" (with a continuity error in that the latter claims the two dances are not the same, whereas \\"Monster Mash\\" claimed they were the same).

A low flow VFS is used as a signal level devices for transmission line pressure control or application of clutches. A high flow VFS controls line pressure directly or are used for direct shift clutch control. A VFS is a type of Transmission Solenoid. One or more VFS can be used in an automatic transmission or installed in an automatic transmission valve body. Theory of operation A variable force solenoid includes: *Actuator shaft that is aligned with the central axis of the valve and solenoid *A electrical conducting wire core *A cylindrical core through which the wire is wound that causes an induced magnetic flux flow *An actuator that actuates a shaft spaced by a non- functional (fixed) air gap from the case and moves axially from the edge of the core *Fixed bearings at the opposite ends of the actuator shaft and compressed spring *A valve spool that controls output flow and pressure In the steady-state condition, the typical VFS design intent is to control pressure by balancing three axial forces: *A spring force due to spring compression by valve position *A magnetic force primarily due to regulated current through the solenoid coil *A pressure force due controlled flow areas and supply pressure, often called line pressure The VFS can be designed such that any of these forces act in either axial direction. If the magnetic force acts opposes the pressure force, then increasing current through the solenoid coil will, at steady-state, cause an increase in VFS output pressure. This is commonly called a \\"proportional\\" VFS since controlled output pressure increases with controlled current. In the absence of current, this design produces low pressure, so it can also be called a \\"normally low\\" solenoid. If magnetic force acts in the same direction as the pressure force, then increasing current will cause a decrease in controlled pressure. This can be called an \\"inversely proportional\\" or \\"normally high\\" solenoid. Other forces can modify the resulting controlled pressure output from the VFS. These include *friction due to hydraulic or magnetic side loading *friction due to debris *steady- state and dynamic flow forces A typical design error for variable pressure controlled electrohydraulic devices involves a poorly controlled minimum working air gap. When this occurs, the magnetic circuit reluctance drops rapidly at high current & small working air gaps, and magnetic force rises rapidly. This is observed as a \\"stuck\\" valve where pressure follows the design intent until a specific point of operation - typically the highest pressure for a normally high or the lowest pressure for a normally low solenoid - at which point a small reversal of current does not cause the expected change in pressure. Magnetic circuit A typical magnetic circuit is driven by a coil winding with controlled current in order to develop a magnetic flux across a working air gap. Out of necessity there is a circular air gap that can only provide radial force (also known as side loading). These two air gaps dominate the magnetic circuit reluctance. The rate of change of the working air gap stored energy provides the axial magnetic force.

(ed.), Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Companionage, Kelly's Directories Ltd, Kingston-upon-Thames, 1968, p.798), one in the Baronetage of England and one in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. As of 2014, both creations are extant. Origins The family derived its surname from the manor of Trevelyan in the parish of St Veep, Cornwall, situated in the ancient hundred of West Wivel, called Trewellen in the Domesday Book of 1086, and shown in the British Ordnance Survey map of 1890 as located about one mile east of Penpoll.0.9 miles east of Penpoll on the south side of the intersection of Route B3389 with an east-west road. A different manor named Trevelien in 1086 (now named Trevillyn) is in the adjacent hundred of Powder. The Trevilian, later Trevelyan Baronetcy, of Nettlecombe in the County of Somerset, was created in the Baronetage of England on 24 January 1662 for George Trevilian. He was the son of George Trevilian, a member of the Somerset gentry and a supporter of the Royalist cause in the Civil War. The 2nd Baronet sat as a Member of Parliament for Somerset and for Minehead. He changed the spelling of the family surname to Trevelyan. The 4th Baronet was a Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne and for Somerset. The 8th Baronet served as High Sheriff of Cornwall for 1906-7. As of 28 February 2014 the present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 1976. Prominent members of the senior branch included: The Venerable George Trevelyan (third son of the 4th Baronet), Archdeacon of Taunton in Somerset. His third son Henry Willoughby Trevelyan was a Major-General in the British Army. His younger son Sir Ernest John Trevelyan (1850‚Äì1929) was a Judge of the High Court of Calcutta, a writer on legal matters and a member of the Oxford Town Council. Humphrey Trevelyan, Baron Trevelyan, son of the Reverend George Philip Trevelyan, son of the Reverend William Pitt Trevelyan, sixth son of the aforementioned the Venerable George Trevelyan, was a diplomat and author. See below. The Trevelyan Baronetcy, of Wallington in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 13 March 1874 for the civil servant and colonial administrator Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet. The estate of Wallington was inherited by Sir George Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet (1707‚Äì1768) from his wife Julia Calverley, daughter of Sir Walter Calverley, 1st Baronet, and his wife Julia Blackett, heiress of Wallington Castle, rebuilt by the Blacketts in the 1689s, who purchased it from the Fenwick family.Laura Trevelyan The 1st Baronet was the son of the aforementioned Venerable George Trevelyan, third son of the fourth Baronet of the 1662 creation (see above). The 2nd Baronet, George Otto Trevelyan, was a prominent historian and Liberal politician. The 3rd Baronet, Charles Phillips Trevelyan, was a Liberal, and later Labour politician. The 4th Baronet, George Lowthian Trevelyan, was a teacher, craftsman in wood and New Age thinker. Three other members of this branch of the family may also be mentioned. R. C. Trevelyan, second son of the 2nd Baronet, was a poet and dramatist. His son Julian Trevelyan is a painter. G. M. Trevelyan, third son of the 2nd Baronet, was a distinguished historian. The family seat is Wallington Hall, near Cambo in Northumberland.

Known for quirky stage antics, such as exploding ukuleles, as well as songs with funny lyrics, The Fabulous Poodles toured with Meat Loaf, Sha Na Na, Tom Petty, Bill Bruford and Chuck Berry (as backing band). They appeared on the Old Grey Whistle Test and for a long time were music critic John Peel's favourite group. The band released three albums between 1977 and 1979 on Pye Records.  History  The Fabulous Poodles started out just as The Poodles. The original Fabulous Poodles consisted of Tony de Meur on lead vocals and guitar, Richie Robertson on bass and vocals, Bobby Valentino on violin, mandolin and vocals, Bryn Burrows on drums and Bob Suffolk on piano. Many of the band's lyrics were written by John Parsons, an artist/poet, who wrote \\"Chicago Boxcar\\", about a hair cut, for deMeur to put music to. Suffolk recognised a possible hit and asked de Meur to join the band. The song was taken to Private Stock Records who released it as a single in connection with Dave Woods. The Poodles began touring England and the continent. Bob Suffolk left the band and went on to design recording studios (Suffolk Studio Design) while the final line up settled down to life on the road with Parsons as van driver, road manager and warm-up act as the Blue Poodle on a unicycle, often with his Jack Russell dog, Nipper, who howled to the harmonica. Parsons designed all the promotional material and merchandise. In 1979 the Fabulous Poodles embarked on an American tour supporting such notable acts as the Ramones and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The Fabulous Poodles were very heavily influenced by such British 1960s acts as The Who and The Kinks. Their first album, Fabulous Poodles, was produced by John Entwistle, bassist for The Who, who also played eight-string bass on a few songs. Their second LP, Unsuitable, featured their two best known songs, \\"Mirror Star\\" and \\"Chicago Boxcar (Boston Back)\\" and was produced by Muff Winwood.

It was one of the first attempts to fully catalogue the existing varieties of English fruit and has been called \\"a classic of late Victorian natural history\\". Only 600 copies were ever printed and originals now fetch high prices whenever they are sold. Over a period of about ten years in the late 19th century, the Pomona Committee of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club of Hereford held an annual autumn show featuring the local varieties of apples and pears. The club members were worried that although Herefordshire was famous for its orchards \\"it was very remarkable that so few of the best varieties of apples should appear in the markets, or the fruit shops\\". At the behest of the committee, Dr Robert Hogg, at the time Vice-President of the Royal Horticultural Society, author of The Fruit Manual, and editor of the RHS Journal; and local doctor and former president of the Woolhope club, Dr Henry Graves Bull, catalogued and described the fruit displayed at the shows. The descriptions were painstakingly illustrated over a period of eight years by Alice Blanche Ellis and Edith Elizabeth Bull, the latter of whom was Robert's daughter. The book originally appeared in seven issues, the first part appearing in 1878 and the last in 1884, and included the 441 original watercolours produced by Alice and Edith of the different fruits, buds, blossoms of the cultivars and the blights which attacked them. The hand-coloured lithographs were done by the Belgian firm of G.

It is beside Dublin City University. Most St. Aidan's students have progressed from the local primary schools such as Larkhill Boys National School; Our Lady of Victories, Ballymun; St. Patrick's National School, Drumcondra; and St. Fiachra's School, Beaumont. History of the school =Early years= The school was opened in 1964 in two classrooms of Larkhill Boys National School under the invitation of Fr. Brady, parish priest of Whitehall. Br. Paul Hayes was the school's first principal. In 1965 the expansion of the school began. Around this time Albert College was moving to the Lyons Estate in Celbridge, leaving a site available for another school, of which St. Aidan's was quick to avail. The government were providing 90% capitation grants to schools to build and expand in addition to Donogh O'Malley providing free education for all, leading to increased numbers. Phase One of the new school was completed in January 1968 and phase 2 was completed by September of that same year. =First extension= During the 1970s the school building began to undergo serious deterioration causing massive amounts of money to be spent on maintenance. The Department of Education was informed of the situation. An application was made to the Department in 1982 for a new building. The main building continued to weaken. In 1986 the school was offered a Schedule of Accommodation stating the rooms and facilities allowed in the building. A preliminary planning briefing meeting between the school's planning team and that of the department took place and a site feasibility report was drawn up in 1987. But no more progress was made. Whether to rebuild the school or not was brought up in the D√°il. The Minister for state re ‚Äì examined the question of rebuilding the school in 1988. In 1989 the school manager, parents and teachers met with the minister for education who promised a reply within 8 weeks. hit or miss In May 1990 there was still no reply. Eventually, after much hard work from Br. Cashel, then principal of the school a new building was ready for students in September 1995. Although the new school building was ready for students in September 1995, the official opening ceremony didn't take place until the 18th of the following October. The opening was attended by Minister for Education and Science Niamh Bhreathnach T.D., Archbishop of Dublin Dr. Desmond Connell and past pupil Bertie Ahern, T.D. In honour of the occasion the Archbishop said mass in the hall. Presently there is more development underway in the form of two extra classrooms which will lead to the provision of a lunch room in the main building. =Second extension= Work began on Phase Two in September 2007. This expansion comprised a second building consisting of two classrooms, a small office, kitchenette and a WC although the layout is subject to change. The extension is currently facilitates the school library and a classroom which features an Interactive Whiteboard. The building, complemented by new paving, was opened by past pupil the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in September 2008. The project, undertaken by then principal Mr. James Reynolds is expected to be followed by further improvements to the school's infrastructure. =North/South Schools link= On 26 November 1998, the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited St. Aidan's as part of the launch of the North- South schools link, which included schools in Limavady, Omagh and Cork.St. Aidan's CBS Website Facilities =Library= The school also has a library fully stocked with books of a variety of types and classifications. These range from classic and modern literature to books which aid students in studying their special topic for Leaving Certificate history. The library is also used for special themed readings in which students are invited to recite or read a favourite work or something of their own composition. =Computer rooms= There are two computer rooms in the school. They are used for many things including Transition Year projects such as the English Speaking Exam which requires a speech and a PowerPoint presentation; career guidance projects like curricula vitae and CAO applications as well as history research for special topics =Sporting facilities= There is a gym, the Edmund Rice Hall, in addition to two full outdoor pitches and two basketball courts. The facilities within the school are complemented by the use of the pool in DCU. There is also the new hall that was opened in 2014. The school is also currently replacing one of their outdoor pitches with an astro pitch which is expected to be ready by the 2016‚Äì17 school year. The other pitch was also renovated and flattened out and it is currently unknown when it will be ready to use. Academia =Junior Certificate= St. Aidan's offers Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate courses and the Transition Year Programme. In addition to the mandatory English, Irish and Maths, for Junior Certificate, St. Aidan's offers Business Studies, History, Geography, Science, C.S.P.E., S.P.H.E., French, and Religious Education. There is also the choice of practical subjects: Woodwork, Technology, Technical Graphics, Music and Art. =Transition Year Programme= The Transition Year Programme that St. Aidan's offer contains a wide variety of subjects and activities. It contains all of the subjects that appear on the Junior Certificate Syllabus including all practical subjects. However the manner in which they are taught differs to the Junior Certificate with much emphasis placed on research and presentation. The activities undertaken by Transition Year students include learning to dance in preparation for a competition and numerous trips throughout the year including Connemara, Newgrange, the National Museum of Ireland and Barcelona. Students also take part in a student ‚Äì run mini company which is then brought to a trade fair. Another option is the YSI (Young Social Innovators) or Formula 1 in which students construct a gas powered car and enter it in races. =Leaving Certificate= For the Leaving Certificate, students must continue to study English, Irish, Maths and Religion with most opting to study French. Students may also choose to study Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Business, Accounting, Economics, History, Geography, Construction Studies, Technology, Art, Music as well as the LCVP Programme. In 2009 93% of Leaving Certificate students went on to study at third level. This is the best performance of any non fee-paying boys secondary school in North Dublin. Extra curricular activities =Sport= There are two PE classes per week along with extra curricular sports. The school has known particular success with athletics and water polo, both coached by Alan O'Neill. In athletics St. Aidan's has won best school in all competitions so far this year. In water polo St. Aidan's won the All Ireland Cup in 2007 and retained it in 2008. Hurling has also known successes including the senior team, coached by James Carmody narrowly missing out on winning the All Ireland ‚ÄòB‚Äô competition. In 2009 the U-16 basketball team, coached by Ms. Peoples, won the All-Ireland Title for the first time led by top scorers Paul Caffrey and Mark Blanchfield. In 2007, St. Aidan's re-entered a soccer team at Under 19 level for the first time in many years. In 2008, they reached the final of the competition, only to be beaten by St. David's CBS Artane on a scoreline of 2‚Äì3. The game was played in Home Farm FC in front of a large crowd. The team was run by league of Ireland footballer/teacher Michael Kelly and Actor/Teacher Darragh Humphries. =Debating and public speaking= Public speaking mainly takes place in each of the junior years, there is a competition within each; every class selects its best speaker by way of a semi final. The final then has a representative from each class. Students, in general, choose their own topic on which to speak. St. Aidan's has known significant success in debating competitions in recent years. Students David Doyle, Karl Elliott, Ben Griffin, and Anthony Madden have all reached the quarter finals of the All-Ireland Schools' Debating Competition; a feat unmatched by nearby schools. Success has also been marked in the AIB Phil Speaks Competition, where in recent years Andrew Linn won the junior competition and David Doyle came second in the senior competition in a grand final where half of the debaters were St. Aidan's students. In 2008 the competition saw its greatest numbers with over 1,000 students taking part and St Aidan's was well represented by Linn, and Elliott taking second and fourth place, respectively. In 2007 Transition Year students Elliot, Andrew Salter and Craig O'Hare reached the Leinster finals of the European Parliament Schools Debating Competition and received a special commendation from adjudicator Eileen Dunne. The students are aided in their endeavours by former staff member and coach Tim O'Connor. =Robocup= In 2006 and 2007 St. Aidan's Students Andrew Jordan, Kevin Reilly, Eoin McCormac and Aaron Kennedy won the Irish Robocup competition. In 2006 this allowed them to proceed to the international competition in Germany and in 2007 Atlanta in the United States. The RoboCup was held in Bremen in Germany in 2006 and Atlanta in 2007.Robocup - Official Website =Immersion Programme= In 2009 a group of ten students from fifth year and transition year spent almost two weeks in Tanzania as part of the Third World Immersion programme. Raising over ‚Ç¨30,000, Mark Blanchfield, Niall Farrell, Niall O'Donnell, Kevin Hogan, Paul McCarthy, Oisin Mulhall, Kevin Reilly, Kevin Ashton, Ronan Noonan and Robert Keenan, accompanied by Ms. Ruane and Ms. Walsh, spent their time in various activities including experiencing the Tanzanian schooling system in the Edmund Rice Sinon School. They visited and took part in activities in an orphanage, youth detention centre and eco-village. They students came back all the richer for the experience and deemed it a success. A trip was organised for a new group of students in 2011; the pupils involved raised 16,000 euro. This Programme has since become bi-annual, with the last Immersion Programme to Tanzania taking place at the end of October 2019 to November 7, 2019, with a layover in Amsterdam. = Euroscola = In March 2017, 4th and 5th year students from the school partook in the European Parliament's Euroscola programme. This came following a national art contest won by Rodrigo Soberon Pena under the theme of European cities outside Ireland during 1916.

He was a high-ranking member of the Atlantean military. Publication history Warlord Krang first appeared in Fantastic Four Annual #1 (1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Warlord Krang was born in Atlantis City, Atlantis. He became a leader of the Atlantean military and warlord of Atlantis who rose to prominence during the time in which Namor, the Prince of Atlantis was missing. Upon Namor's return, Krang's bride-to-be, the Lady Dorma, deserted him for Namor, bringing a great hatred for Namor from Krang. Shortly thereafter, when Namor attempted to conquer New York City, he made Krang his second in command. However, the Fantastic Four fought off the first attack and Namor stopped the invasion in order to save Sue Storm of the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four Annual #1. Marvel Comics. Feeling that Namor had betrayed his own people to save an enemy, Krang was even more angered and after the Atlanteans left Atlantis he seized control and usurped the throne of Atlantis from Namor.Daredevil #7. Marvel Comics. Krang imprisoned Namor, and forced the Prince to prove himself on a quest to find Neptune's trident, made additionally difficult by traps set by Krang. Meanwhile, Krang plotted a conquest of the surface world, ruled Atlantis as a despot, and put down a revolt against his rule. When Namor returned, he defeated Krang in personal combat. Krang was dethroned and exiled.Tales to Astonish #70-76. Marvel Comics. Krang, now a professional criminal, through the Puppet Master, set the Behemoth against Namor. While Namor was busy, Krang returned to Atlantis and tricked Lady Dorma into renewing their engagement and accompanying him to the surface world, as well as tricking Namor into believing that she had betrayed him and left willingly. Fleeing to the surface world with Dorma he would come into conflict with the armored avenger Iron Man, and fomented a battle between Namor and Iron Man.Tales to Astonish #79-82; Tales of Suspense #79-80. Marvel Comics. In a battle with Krang, Namor was inflicted with temporary amnesia. Krang used Atlantean technology to create a tidal wave in Manhattan. However Namor finally recovered, capturing Krang and defeating him in personal combat. Namor imprisoned him, exiling him once more.Tales to Astonish #83-87. Marvel Comics. When Namor's evil cousin Byrrah seized the throne of Atlantis and invited Krang back to enjoy his former position, Krang formed an alliance with Byrrah and Attuma. This however was short-lived and soon Krang was forced to flee yet again when Byrrah's scheme failed.Tales to Astonish #91. Marvel Comics. After this he would attempt to steal the Serpent Crown, a powerful object, which would make him nearly invincible. These efforts however were thwarted by Namor and Captain America (who called himself Nomad at the time). Krang was driven fully insane. When Namor spent much time on the surface world allied with Doctor Doom, Krang once more seized control of Atlantis. Stealing the Trumpet Horn of Namor, he summoned the great beast Gargantus, to defeat the returning Namor, but it was soundly defeated by the Prince, while his ally, Dr. Doom, beat Krang within an inch of his life with a neuro-shock blade. Somewhat after altering his physiology through the technological means of Wundagore Mountain,The Last Defenders #1. Marvel Comics. Krang has been recruited as a member of the Defenders.The Last Defenders #6. Marvel Comics. Warlord Krang later appears as one of the Atlanteans living on the X-Men's base Utopia.Uncanny X-Men #528. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Krang has all the powers inherent to members of the Atlantean race, including superhuman strength. He is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow him to breathe underwater, he can swim at high speeds and his body is resistant against the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans. His specially developed vision allows him to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean. Originally he could survive only for 9 minutes out of water, unless he uses a special serum that gives him the ability to breathe air, which changes his skin from blue to pink. This chemical allowed him to breathe surface air through his lungs (although when using this he temporarily loses his ability to breathe beneath the waves). He often wore a water-filled breathing helmet for operating on land. His stamina, agility, and reflexes were reduced when out of the water. Krang later changed his own physiology through technological means to allow himself to breathe in water as well as on air indefinitely. This procedure also seems to have removed the limitation of his physical abilities when outside water and somewhat fortified his personal strength to an yet unknown degree.The Last Defenders #1 He is a master of all forms of Atlantean armed and unarmed combat, and has achieved mastery of most Atlantean weapons. Krang is a master planner and strategist, and a skilled leader. He possesses a diabolic cunning and is an expert fencer. Krang wears conventional Atlantean military attire over body armor of an unspecified composition. He wields an electrically charged sword known as a neuro-shock blade, and a standard Atlantean pistol firing bursts of concussive force. He wears a specially-designed battle helmet, and body armor over an electro-repellent chest-shield, and forged steel gauntlets equipped with electronic knuckles. He sometimes uses various other items which he has usually stolen such as the trumpet horn, and the serpent crown. In his exile he controls an army made up of remnants of Byrrah's and Attuma's armies, as well as a few surface men.

Salt and Light is a network of neocharismatic Evangelical Christian churches that is part of the British New Church Movement. Coombs was received apostolically by many Charismatic churches in North America, Africa, India, Europe, the UK and New Zealand, and was seen as the 'father' of the Salt and Light family of churches.Salt and Light Ministries International :: Barney Coombs He was married to Janette until his death in 2018 and they had three children and eight grandchildren. Early life Coombs was born in 1937 in Whitstable, England. After leaving school he entered the police force before becoming a Christian and responding to a call to full-time Christian ministry. He studied at Capernwray Bible School, where he graduated with honours. Career =Pastoral ministry= Coombs was ordained as pastor of Basingstoke Baptist Church (later becoming Basingstoke Community Churches) in 1966. He later moved to Canada to be based at West Coast Christian Fellowship in Vancouver. Coombs has written a number of books including A Guide to Practical Pastoring, Apostles Today, God‚Äôs Plan for Himself, Finding Your Purpose in God's Plan and Dealing with What Life Throws At You: How Life's Ups and Downs Can Lead Us to a Greater Intimacy with Jesus. =British New Church Movement= In the mid-late 1960s Coombs became involved in the restoration movement that grew around key charismatic figures such as Arthur Wallis, David Lillie and Cecil Cousen. The main thrust of this group was that a return of the 'charismatic gifts' (i.e. prophecy and speaking in tongues) to the traditional denominations was not sufficient, and that the church needed to be restored to the New Testament forms of church government as described in St. Paul's epistle to the Ephesians - Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist and Pastor/Teacher (Eph 4:11). This became known as the fivefold ministries, and the group saw the fulfillment of these offices as essential to the reviving of the worldwide Christian Church. In Finding Your Purpose In God's Plan Coombs credits DeVern Fromke as a significant influence on the theology he and the wider group were developing at this time. In the early 1970s Coombs became part of the \\"fabulous fourteen\\",Scott, J. (1997). The Theology of the so- called New Church Movement: An Analysis of the Eschatology. Master of Theology. Brunel University. a group of leaders who sought to develop a theology and ecclesiology that would guide the restoration of the Church. Later that decade, however, leaders of the restoration movement diverged into two separate streams. \\"Restoration 1\\" followed the more conservative teachings of Arthur Wallis and Bryn Jones, while \\"Restoration 2\\" took a more relaxed view of cinema, popular music, and ‚Äòsecular‚Äô culture, were generally less separatist in ecclesiology (contributing significantly to the resurgence of the Evangelical Alliance), and encouraged the leadership ministries of women. Coombs identified more closely with the \\"Restoration 1\\" stream which included the ministries of Terry Virgo, Bryn Jones and Tony Morton. =Salt and Light Ministries= Driven by the conviction that the body of Christ is in essence relational and would eventually come to fullness of stature, and influenced by the ideas of British restorationism, Coombs began to gather around him a number of other pastors and leaders with the same vision. =Theology= Central to the theology of Coombs was that the body of Christ is essentially relational and will eventually come to fullness of stature. The priesthood of all believers, the cross-centred gospel, the Kingdom of God, a victorious eschatology, and the summing up of all things in Christ are all important doctrines to Coombs and the Salt and Light network.

Gilbert enrolled in the School of Fine Arts in Santiago de Chile in 1936, studying under Jorge Caballero and Hern√°n Gazmurri, well- known encouragers of the Chilean plastic rebellion that later transformed into the Montparnasse group. In 1942, Gilbert returned to Guayaquil to study under Hans Michaelson. Through Michaelson Gilbert learned about European Expressionism and her work from this period was mostly figurative. At this time Gilbert was also part of an intellectual group from Guayaquil known as the Society of Independent Writers and Artists. In 1943 Gilbert finished her dissertation in Painting, Sculpture and Art History from the School of Fine Arts in Guayaquil. Shortly thereafter, Gilbert moved to New York, where she studied at the Ozenfant Art School as a disciple of Am√©d√©e Ozenfant, one of the fathers of post-cubist purism and takes an important step towards the development of her own style. In 1946, at the end of World War II, Araceli returned to Ecuador and moved to the capital city, Quito. In 1950 she traveled to Paris and contacted Auguste Herbin, who in 1931 had created the Abstraction-Cr√©ation Group. With the guidance of Herbin, Gilbert learned to combine the geometrical and abstract concepts, subjecting them to mathematical rigor. Gilbert participated in the Spanish American Anti-biennial organized by Picasso, as well as several group shows such as the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles. In 1953, Gilbert took a painting technology course with abstract artist Jean Dewasne. In 1954, she presented a solo show at the Arnaud Gallery in Paris with an album of lithographs, including a prologue by Le√≥n D√©gand. In 1955, Gilbert returned from Paris and married the Swedish writer, photographer and explorer Rolf Blomberg. In 1960, she won the Second Prize at the IV October Salon in Guayaquil. The next year she won the First Prize for painting at the Mariano Aguilera Salon in Quito. By this point Araceli had consolidated her style, which was reaching its splendor. She mounted several solo shows and participated in the most important group shows of the country. She also represented Ecuador in the Biennial of S√£o Paulo in Brazil, Biennial of La Havana in Cuba and Biennial of Colt√©jer in Medell√≠n, Colombia.

Background Tanganyika and Zanzibar, the two constituents of modern Tanzania, had come under German rule in by the 1880s. The territory was inhabited by a large number of ethnic groups speaking different languages. The German colonial government decided to use Kiswahili as the language of administration after becoming fearful that use of German would introduce the local population to subversive Marxist texts. The British, who took over after the defeat of Germany in World War 1 continued this policy. Swahili has 17 dialects. The Interterritorial Language Committee in 1930 under British colonial rule in East Africa tasked with creating a standardized form of the language. The Kiunjuga dialect spoken in Zanzibar was chosen as the base. The committee was also involved in standardizing the spelling as well as coining new words. The committee was reorganized into a purely academic institution as Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili (TATAKI) in 1964 and integrated into the University of Dar es Salaam in 1970. Meanwhile, the Tanganyika African National Union, fighting for freedom from colonial rule, had adopted Kiswahili as a language of mass organization and political revolution. After coming to power, Kiswahili was made the national language and was seen as a tool for national integration and social development. Since Taasisi ya Uchunguzi was Kiswahili had transitioned into a purely academic institution, there was a void with respect to its standardization functions. Baraza la Kiswahili la Taifa was founded to fill this void. Foundation and activities BAKITA was founded by a parliamentary act in 1967 as organization dedicated to the development and advocacy of Kiswahili as a means of national integration in Tanzania. Its mission was laid down in this act and further expanded in an amendment passed in 1983. Key activities mandated for the organization include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Kiswahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organizations involved with Kiswahili, standardizing the language BAKITA cooperates with organizations like TATAKI in creation, standardization and dissemination of specialized terminologies Other institutions can propose new vocabulary to respond to emerging needs but only BAKITA can approve usage. By the end of the 1970s, terminologies had been published in Tafsisru Sanifu, a BAKITA journal, for economics and business, administration and government, mathematics, science, social science and engineering among other fields. BAKITA coordinates its activities with similar bodies in Kenya and Uganda to aid in the development of Kiswahili.

In 1913, it was the first hospital in the United States to have air conditioning in its surgical suites, and it was the site of milestone medical research that developed sulfonamide drug treatment for meningitis in the 1940s. The hospital developed a relationship with LSU Health Sciences Center in the 1970s and 1980s. It was purchased by the Louisiana State University System in 1991, renamed and converted into a teaching hospital for the adjacent medical school, which it also oversaw. Like its sister hospital, Charity Hospital, University Hospital sustained severe flood damage during Hurricane Katrina, and its patients were evacuated by boat and helicopter after the storm. In addition to the flood damage to the structure itself, the significant flooding caused the emergency generators to become submerged (as a result of being on the first floor), eventually becoming inundated with floodwater and failing. Another substantial impact caused by the overwhelming flood waters was the devastation to the sewage system. As those employed by the hospital attempted to successfully care for patients while dealing with limited supplies and manpower, the sewage system eventually failed, exposing all occupants of the hospital to potential diseases and illnesses. However, the hospital was extensively renovated and reopened November 20, 2006. Although staff shortages and other limitations originally only allowed for a capacity of 85 out of 575 beds, the reopening was seen by many as a turning point for New Orleans, having had a severe shortage of emergency care since Katrina. In October 2009, University, with the closure of Charity Hospital, was designated the city's new Level I trauma center, named \\"Spirit of Charity\\", and alleviated West Jefferson Medical Center and East Jefferson General Hospital, which had been serving as the trauma centers up until then. As of 2014 the hospital is operating at 235 staffed beds. The successor of Charity Hospital following Hurricane Katrina, Interim LSU Hospital was the main teaching hospital for LSU Health Sciences Center and was the only hospital in south Louisiana certified as a Level I Trauma Center by the American College of Surgeons. Interim LSU Hospital was closed on August 1, 2015, with all patients and services being moved to the newly built University Medical Center New Orleans.

Definition  A. Rao, N. Thorberry and J. Weintraub define autonomous teamwork as \\"groups of independent workers, who regulate much of their own task behaviour around relatively whole tasks. This kind of groups are also generally allowed to select and train new members, set their own work pace, supervise most of their own activities and often trade jobs among themselves\\" We can distinguish semi- autonomous and autonomous teams, the deference depends of the degree of autonomy of the group. Nowadays, more and more companies are employing (semi)autonomous work groups, such as car‚Äôs industry, mass distribution sector and currently starts ‚Äòup. To succeed and be performant in its tasks a (semi)autonomous team needs: * Communication and coordination: team members have to transmit all the information to another in a common language, a well coordination between team members permits to obtain those information when needed and move easily from one task to another; * Cohesion: brings in the team a stability, a feeling of unity, a satisfaction and permits to respond positively to each other and to communicate well; * Decision making and taking responsibilities: to succeed the team must collect information, discuss, evaluate alternatives and most importantly decide collaboratively on the appropriate way of action.  Autonomous Teamwork and Psychological Well-being  There is an ongoing phenomenon that autonomous teamwork supposedly has a positive influence on the psychological well-being of employees. A study conducted by two universities of Netherland focuses on the influences of the perceived group autonomy and individual autonomy, respectively on the individual tasks and psychological well-being. Through a poll conducted on employees in a supermarket chain, which targets different aspects of team work, (i.e. individual autonomy, social relationships with colleagues or even individual workload). It was found that there is no strong relationship between psychological fatigue and individual task variety, also between motivation to learn and quality of social relationships. There is still a positive impact of the individual aspects of the work on the motivation. It shows indeed that autonomous work increases variety, decreases individual workload and overall improves the quality of social relationships.

This is accomplished by developing metrics to quantify and qualify basic business processes that can then be used to streamline and improve those processes. Typical PSA functions include project management and documentation, time recording, billing, reporting, and labor utilization. These features are often integrated with accounting, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, and payroll systems in order to improve efficiency of overall operations. As a result, in addition to better managing client projects, independent contractors can prevent lost revenue and slow billing cycles. Ultimately PSA software suites allow users to integrate industry-appropriate metrics in order to better understand operations and, in turn, improve efficiency and profitability. As businesses grow, the size and complexity of their projects tend to increase as well. PSA software is used to provide visibility into mid-project profitability.  Types of PSA software  In its simplest form, PSA software may offer only timesheet systems (including expense reporting and project management). However, in their most robust incarnation they can also include customer relationship management (CRM), resource management, opportunity and knowledge management.  Impact of PSA software  PSA software is designed to improve the performance and profitability of professional services firms. A recent end-user survey conducted by SPI Research showed significant improvement in key performance indicators such as: * Faster staffing and invoicing workflows * Lower project cancellation rates * Improved on-time, under-budget project delivery rates * Lower revenue leakage * Higher resource utilization rates * Improved project margins The study concluded with a return on investment (ROI) model for an average 172-person professional services firm. According to the research, over a five-year horizon, the firm could expect to invest just under $200,000 in implementation and software license costs. The return, however, was estimated at nearly $23 million in increased revenue and reduced costs.

He later wrote for The Baltimore Sun and The Philadelphia Inquirer before moving to the athletic departments at Saint Joseph's University and then Penn State. He served as Penn State's Assistant Sports Publicity Director in the late 1960s. Accorsi began his NFL career in 1970 with the Baltimore Colts as its Public Relations Director, and worked on then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle's staff in the league office from 1975 before rejoining the Colts two years later as Assistant General Manager. Baltimore Colts Accorsi was promoted to General Manager of the Colts in 1982. The Colts finished 0‚Äì8‚Äì1 in the strike-shortened 1982 season, thereby earning the right to select Stanford University quarterback John Elway with the first overall pick. Elway, however, refused to play for Baltimore, and using leverage as a draftee of the New York Yankees baseball club, forced a trade to the Denver Broncos. The team finished 7‚Äì9 in 1983, but that would be their last season in Baltimore. Accorsi resigned as GM after the 1983 season, just before the team's move to Indianapolis. Cleveland Browns In 1985, Accorsi was hired by then Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell to serve as the team's new General Manager and Executive Vice President of Football Operations, serving for seven seasons. Accorsi was responsible for the acquisition of quarterback Bernie Kosar in the 1985 supplemental draft. During his tenure the Browns made five playoff appearances and got to the AFC Championship Game three times, but lost each time to Elway's Broncos. Accorsi resigned in 1992. New York Giants Accorsi joined the Giants in 1994 and served as an assistant to the general manager, legendary George Young, until he succeeded Young in 1998. The Giants made one Super Bowl appearance under Accorsi in Super Bowl XXXV, which they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 34-7. They won two NFC East division titles (2000 and 2005) while making the playoffs four times (2000, 2002, 2005, and 2006). Accorsi's highest profile personnel move came at the 2004 NFL Draft, where he traded Giants first-round draft choice quarterback Philip Rivers and three draft picks (a third-round pick in 2004 and first-round and 5th-round picks in 2005) to the San Diego Chargers for Number 1 overall draft choice quarterback Eli Manning, giving the Giants a young franchise quarterback. The move met with the approval of Giants fans, who cheered loudly when the trade was announced by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Manning then led the Giants to playoff appearances in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, Manning led the Giants to three straight road playoff victories, culminating in a victory over the then- undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Following the 2011 season, Manning would capture the Super Bowl XLVI title. Manning was named MVP of both Super Bowl XLII and XLVI, validating Accorsi's belief that Manning was a star talent. Accorsi was also responsible for drafting Osi Umenyiora, Chris Snee, Justin Tuck, Mathias Kiwanuka, and Brandon Jacobs, as well as signing Antonio Pierce, Kareem McKenzie, Plaxico Burress, and Fred Robbins as free agents. He hired former head coach Tom Coughlin after the dismissal of Jim Fassel following the 2003 season. Accorsi retired in early 2007. Consultant work On November 9, 2012, Accorsi was hired by the Carolina Panthers as a consultant after general manager Marty Hurney was fired.

Life  He was born in Weimar, the eldest son of Johann Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and Princess Christine Elisabeth of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. When his father died in 1683, he succeeded him as duke; however, he was compelled to rule jointly with his younger brother Johann Ernst III. Because John Ernest III was alcoholic, William Ernest took full control of the government of the duchy and permitted John Ernest the nominal title of co-duke (Mitherr) until his death in 1707. After the death of his brother he made John Ernest's son, Ernest August I, co-duke, but with no real power. Six months after the death of his father (2 November 1683), William Ernest married in Eisenach with Charlotte Marie, his cousin and eldest surviving daughter of his uncle Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Jena, in order to secure the family lands. At that time, the guardian of Charlotte and his younger brother, the duke Johann William of Saxe-Jena, was the duke John George I of Saxe-Eisenach, their only surviving uncle. When he died in 1686, the guardianship of the duke of Saxe-Jena was taken by William Ernest, his cousin and brother-in-law. William Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Weimar William Ernest was a strict Lutheran and commanded that only men who could read and comment on Lutheran theological writings be admitted to his armed forces. The composer Johann Sebastian Bach worked for the duke from 1708, first as organist, then as Konzertmeister (leader of the orchestra) in Weimar. When Johann Samuel Drese died in 1716, Bach solicited his post of Kapellmeister (head of the court musical establishment), but William Ernest appointed Drese's incompetent son for the post instead; furious, Bach solicited his dismissal from the Duke's service. Annoyed at Bach's impertinence, William Ernest had Bach jailed for four weeks in a fortress before he accepted his dismissal. On 23 August 1690, William Ernest and Charlotte Marie were divorced after seven years of childless and extremely unhappy union. Two months later, on 4 November, duke John William of Saxe-Jena (Charlotte Marie's brother), died without heirs, and Wilhelm Ernst took possession of part of his duchy after a treaty was signed with the Saxe-Eisenach branch of his family. William Ernest never remarried and died at Weimar without heirs; his nephew Ernest August I became his successor.  Ancestors   References  * G. L√§mmerhirt: Wilhelm Ernst.

The term is frequently used in Judaism to describe God, and worldly items can also have holy status. \\"Kedushah\\" is also the name of a prayer in Judaism which describes God's holiness.  Holiness in Judaism  The Hebrew word , transliterated as , is used in the Torah to mean 'set-apartness' and 'separateness', as well as 'holiness' and 'sacredness'. The Torah describes the Aaronite priests and the Levites as being selected by God to perform the Temple services; they, as well, are called \\"holy.\\" Holiness is not a single state, but contains a broad spectrum. The Mishnah lists concentric circles of holiness surrounding the Temple in Jerusalem: Holy of Holies, Temple Sanctuary, Temple Vestibule, Court of Priests, Court of Israelites, Court of Women, Temple Mount, the walled city of Jerusalem, all the walled cities of Israel, and the borders of the Land of Israel.Mishnah Kelim, chapter 1 Distinctions are made as to who and what are permitted in each area. Likewise, the Jewish holidays and the Shabbat are considered to be holy in time; the Torah calls them \\"holy [days of] gathering\\". Work is not allowed on those days, and rabbinic tradition lists 39 categories of activity that are specifically prohibited.Mishna, Shabbat 7:2 Beyond the intrinsically holy, objects can become sacred through consecration. Any personal possession may be dedicated to the Temple of God, after which its misappropriation is considered among the gravest of sins. The various sacrifices are holy. Those that may be eaten have very specific rules concerning who may eat which of their parts, and time limits on when the consumption must be completed. Most sacrifices contain a part to be consumed by the priests ‚Äì a portion of the holy to be consumed by God's holy devotees. The encounter with the holy is seen as eminently desirable, and at the same time fearful and awesome. For the strongest penalties are applied to one who transgresses in this area ‚Äì one could in theory receive either the death penalty or the heavenly punishment of kareth, spiritual excision, for mis- stepping in his close approach to God's domain. Jewish kabbalistic tradition expresses holiness as possible perception of the soul, above all united to the body: hence the repeated allusion to the involvement of the supernal worlds in relation to the world of Assiah, so-called \\"material world\\". \\"Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am God your Lord\\": Sanctify yourselves‚Äî these are the \\"first waters\\" And be holy‚Äî these are the \\"last waters\\".Talmud, Berakhot 53b (\\"Bereshit\\" and \\"Tzimtzum\\": Avir (Judaism)) \\"Sanctify yourselves\\" means to take the initiative and work to become holy. Afterwards, \\"be holy\\"‚Äî strengthen yourself to maintain your level of holiness.Likutey Halakhot II, p. 69a  The Kedushah prayer  Kedushah is the name of several prayers recited during Jewish prayer services. They have in common the recitation of two Biblical verses - and . These verses come from prophetic visions in which angels sing the verses as praises to God. There exist several variations of the Kedushah, which appear in different contexts and have different laws. The best-known Kedushah is recited in the Amidah. Another is recited in the Yotzer ohr blessing, and a third (known as Kedushah d'sidra) is recited on various occasions including the conclusion of weekday Shacharit. In some versions of the kedushah, additional Biblical verses are added in the same format as the verses from Isaiah and Ezekiel.On the origins of the Kedushah, see David Flusser, ‚ÄúSanctus und Gloria,‚Äù in Abraham Unser Vater: Juden und Christen im Gespr√§ch √úber die Bibel Festschrift f√ºr Otto Michael (ed. Otto Betz, Martin Hengel, and Peter Schmidt; Leiden: Brill, 1963), 129-152; repr. in David Flusser, Entdeckungen im Neuen Testament (2 vols.; Neukirchener, 1987-1999), 1:226-244.

In the silent Amidah it is a short prayer, but in the repetition, which requires a minyan, it is considerably lengthier. The liturgy varies among different communities and during different services, but they all hold in common three Bible verses (though translations vary): : :Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh Adonai Tz'vaot M'lo Khol Ha'aretz K'vodo :\\"Holy, Holy, Holy, The Lord of Hosts, The entire world is filled with His Glory.\\" : :Baruch K'vod Adonai Mim'komo :\\"Blessed is the Glory of the Lord in Its Place\\" : :Yimloch Adonai L'Olam, Elohayich Tziyon L'dor Vador Hall'luyah :\\"The Lord shall reign forever, Your God, O Zion, from generation to generation, Hallelujah\\" All three of the verses cited above are recited as part of the congregational response to the cantor. For the first verse, , it is traditional for everyone to rise to their toes with each recitation of the word ('holy').Scott-Martin Kosofsky, The Book of Customs, Harper San Francisco, 2004; page 33. In the morning and Musaf services of Shabbat and Festivals, an enhanced version of the Kedushah is recited, with additional praises in between the biblical verses. In the Mussaf service of Shabbat and Festivals, as well as all of the Kedushahs of Yom Kippur, a fourth verse is recited responsively: the opening line of the Shema. During the Kedushah of the Amidah, prayer participants are expected to stand. Kedushah is recited whenever the Amidah is repeated - that is to say, in Shacharit, Mincha, Mussaf, and Neilah, but not Maariv. = Kedushah in Yotzer Ohr = A second Kedushah is recited as part of the Yotzer ohr blessing, before the Shema. The only two verses recited here are Isaiah 6:3 and Ezekiel 3:12. Early sources dispute whether this kedushah may be recited by individuals praying without a minyan. The Shulchan Aruch records this dispute, and permits individuals to recite it even alone, but recommends that they recite it in the Torah reading chant, so that it is akin to Torah study rather than a kedushah recitation. The Rema, recording Ashkenazi practice, permits individuals to recite the kedushah without the Shulchan Aruch's recommendation.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 59:3 = Kedushah d'sidra = There is also a text called the Kedushah D'Sidra () which is recited at the conclusion of weekday morning services, at the beginning of the afternoon services of Shabbat and Festivals, the conclusion of the evening service of Saturday night, and the beginning of the Neilah service at the end of Yom Kippur. This Kedushah contains three verses. The first two are the usual Isaiah 6:3 and Ezekiel 3:12. The third verse is (which is similar but not identical to Psalms 146:10, recited in the Amidah Kedushah). After each Biblical verse is recited in Hebrew, its Aramaic translation (Targum) is recited. This Kedushah does not require a minyan. = Sources and history = Kedushah is mentioned in several sources from the Talmudic period. The earliest source is the Tosefta, which says: :Rabbi Yehudah would answer with the blesser: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the entire world is full of His honor' and 'Blessed is the honor of the Lord from His place'.Tosefta Brachot 1:11 The Talmud states that the Great Assembly established \\"blessings, prayers, kedushot, and havdalot\\",Brachot 33a but Rashi argues that the word \\"kedushot\\" here refers to kiddush rather than to Kedushah. Hekhalot Rabbati describes the angels praising God using the verses Isaiah 6:3, Ezekiel 3:12, Psalms 146:10; and the Jewish people reciting the verses \\"in Shacharit and Mincha\\".Hekhalot Rabbati 10:5 Similarly, the Talmud describes the angels reciting Isaiah 6:3 and Ezekiel 3:12, and Jews reciting at least the first of those verses: :Three groups of ministering angels say song each day; one says 'Holy', one says 'Holy', one says 'Holy is the Lord of hosts'. ... The ministering angels do not say song above until Israel says it below ... But there is [also the verse] 'Blessed'! - It is [a different group of angels, the] ofanim, who say [that verse]...Chullin 91b The accepted custom was to recite Kedushah in every Shacharit and Mincha Amidah repetition. However, Jews of the Land of Israel in this period only recited the Kedushah of the Amidah on special days - either Shabbat,Tosafot Sanhedrin 37b (s.v. mikanaf) in the name of the geonim or on any day Mussaf is recited as well as Hanukkah.Soferim 20:5; Kobetz Hitzei Giborim - Pleitat Sofrim 10 (Nisan 2017), p. 263, text: ◊ú◊§◊ô ◊©◊ë◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ë◊ñ◊û◊ü ◊î◊ß◊ì◊ï◊ù ◊ú◊ê ◊î◊ô◊ï ◊ê◊ï◊û◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ß◊ì◊ï◊©◊î ◊ë◊ô◊û◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ó◊ï◊ú, ◊ê◊ú◊ê ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™ ◊ï◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊ò◊ï◊ë ◊ï◊®\\"◊ó ◊ï◊ó◊†◊ï◊õ◊î ◊ë◊ú◊ë◊ì, see also footnote 4 Similarly, they recited the Kedushah of Yotzer Ohr only on such special occasions,Ezra Fleischer, HaYotzrot beHithavyutan veHitpatchutan (Jerusalem, 1984), p. 7 and some communities may not have recited it at all.Ezra Fleischer, ◊ú◊™◊§◊ï◊¶◊™◊ü ◊©◊ú ◊ß◊ì◊ï◊©◊™ ◊î◊¢◊û◊ô◊ì◊î ◊ï◊î◊ô◊ï◊¶◊® ◊ë◊û◊†◊î◊í◊ï◊™ ◊î◊™◊§◊ô◊ú◊î ◊©◊ú ◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, Tarbitz 38:266 = In other religions = The first Biblical verse in the Kedushah, Isaiah 6:3, is also found in the Sanctus of some Christian liturgical ordinaries.

The biology, distribution and conservation of this species are dealt with in the following paragraphs with a main focus on Australia as it was here it first became protected. Biology The grey nurse shark, Carcharias taurus, also called the your dad or ragged-tooth shark, is an elasmobranch and belongs to the odontaspididae (ragged-tooth) shark family. It can easily be recognized by its characteristic conical snout and under hung jaw. Both jaws are laden with sharp, long and pointed teeth. The head is flattened and it has a large and stout body which ranges up to 12.2m and may weigh up to 300 kg. The body is grey to grey-brown dorsally and off-white on the belly. The juveniles (young sharks) usually have dark spots on the upper two thirds of the body. The first and second dorsal fins are of similar size and the caudal fin is asymmetric. Once believed to be a man-eater it is now known that this shark rarely attacks humans and if it does it is only in defense; or if it is baited. Sharks are the top predators in our oceans, and as such they are important for the marine ecosystems as important regulators of other species. They eat the weak, the old and the dead animals. The grey nurse sharks eat mainly lobsters, crabs, smaller sharks, fish, rays and squid. Distribution The grey nurse sharks live near the coast in sub-tropical to cool-temperate waters near most continental land masses (not found in the eastern Pacific Ocean off North and South America). They have a preference for some places resulting in an uneven distribution. For example, there are few grey nurse sharks found in north Australia while they are relatively abundant in the southern part of the eastern and western Australian waters. They are usually found swimming slowly, just above the sea floor, in sandy-bottomed gutters or in rocky underwater caves near inshore rocky reefs and islands. They can be found at depths ranging from 10m (near the coastline) to 200m (on the continental shelf). They are generally solitary but at times small schools of grey nurse sharks are found swimming and feeding together. Conservation status in Australia The grey nurse shark is one of the most critically endangered shark species and believed to be the first protected shark in the world. It was declared ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô in the waters of New South Wales (Australia) in 1984 and later throughout the world. In 1996 the species was listed globally ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and declared ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô in Commonwealth waters of Australia. According to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act 1999) it is believed that there are two separate populations of Grey nurse shark in Australia. The population in the east coast is listed as ‚Äòcritically endangered‚Äô whereas the west coast population is listed as ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô under the EPBC Act (1999) The grey nurse sharks are also protected under the Fisheries Legislation in New South Wales, Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland. In the Northern Territory the species is classified as ‚Äòdata deficient‚Äô by the Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act (2000)NTG. Current status The population has declined dramatically in recent decades, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. After 20 years of protection the population is still declining and there are approximately 1000-1500 grey nurse sharks left in Eastern Australia. Causes for decline Every year, millions of sharks are killed by drift-nets, by- catch, revenge actions, beach protective shark meshing, commercial-, recreational- and spear-fishing. The main risk is from by-catch of indirect methods of line fishing and particularly bottom-set commercial fishing lines targeting wobbegong sharks. The grey nurse sharks are particularly vulnerable to these threats due to their late maturation and low breeding success. They reach sexual maturity at the age of 3 months and give birth to 1 or 2 young every second year, thus the population grows very slowly. Furthermore, their limited distribution and specific habitats make it difficult for them to migrate to ght in the nets and cannot escape. This also occurs in trawling and fishing nets. Another threat for the sharks is finning. Conservation efforts The increased public awareness has led to the development of methods that reduce the unintentional killing of elasmobranch (sharks and rays), turtles and marine mammals. An inexpensive method to reduce by-catch is by using tunnel excluders. These enable sharks, turtles and rays to escape and survive. A prototype used by the Dutch achieved a 40-100% reduction of the by- catch of the most vulnerable species. The size and texture of nets are also of great importance for the survival of larger vulnerable species. Often smaller nets have been shown to catch the same amount of target fish and reduce the by-catch greatly, especially of the mature sharks. Foundation of protected marine areas is particularly valuable for protecting sharksGarla, R.C., Chapman, D.D, Wetherbee, B.M. and Shivji, M. (2006) \\"Movement pattern of young Caribbean reef sharks, Carcharhinus perezi, at Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil: the potential of marine protected areas for conservation of nursery ground.\\" Marine Biology 149, pp. 189-199. and a new method, taggingCSIRO, can reveal their preferred forage and breeding areas. A good example of managed marine areas is to be found in Jervis Bay, NSW.Lynch, T.P., Melling, L., Hamilton, R., Macready, A. and Feary, S. (2004) \\"Conflict and Impacts of Divers and Anglers in a Marine Park.\\" Environmental Management Vol. 33, No. 2, pp. 196-211. Jervis Bay has been divided into time zones, some for fishing and some for diving, and the strategy has been approved by both fishermen and divers. However, ‚ÄúDivers that regularly dive at places like South West Rocks in New South Wales will tell you that up to 70 per cent of the sharks there are trailing hooks from line fishing.‚Äù says Nicola Beynon from the Humane Society International (HSI). Another widely used method for preserving sharks is eco-tourism such as scuba diving,Libosada, C. M. (1998) Ecotourism in the Philippines. Makati City, Bookmark. cage-diving and feeding of sharks. However, it is crucial that this is strictly managed, and that the sharks‚Äô behaviour is monitored. Feeding and touching of marine animals should be strictly discouraged since it can alter their behaviour, and result in long lasting and severe stress to the animals. Divers have noticed sharks altering their behaviour due to increased hierarchy behaviour around killing areas. The lowest in the hierarchy become stressed and exhibit unpredictable behaviour, which could result in attacks on humans.

It borders the village of Veenoord, the twin village of Nieuw-Amsterdam. Since 1998 Nieuw- Amsterdam and Veenoord are part of the municipality of Emmen. History In 1850, a group of investors from Amsterdam bought a tract of peatland and named it after their own city: Amsterdamscheveld (\\"field of Amsterdam\\"). A settlement, that was built near these lands several years later, was called Nieuw-Amsterdam. The settlement developed itself quickly because of the peat trade. Drenthe therefore acquired the nickname Drents California. The only difference was that there was no gold in the ground, but peat. Important for the development of the village was that it is situated along the canal called the Verlengde Hoogeveensevaart. The \\"Hervormde kerk\\" was erected in 1873 by the architect H. C. Winters. The \\"gereformeerde kerk\\" with its paraboloidal roof was built in 1925, based on the design by architect W. van Straten. The names of both churches can be translated in English as \\"Reformed Church\\" =Vincent van Gogh= Most of the time Vincent van Gogh spent in Drenthe, in autumn 1883, he lodged with Scholte in Nieuw-Amsterdam. Today, Scholte's lodging house is known as the Van Gogh House (Van Gogh Huis). Recently, the municipality of Emmen planned to demolish the building, but at the last moment this decision was reversed. Today, it houses a restaurant and a museum. The Drawbridge in Nieuw-Amsterdam is probably the most popular work Van Gogh executed during his stay in Nieuw-Amsterdam. Even more popular is the oral tradition concerning Van Gogh at whatever place he stayed for a while. Thus, in Nieuw-Amsterdam he is said to have paid the rent with his paintings, but the landlord could not estimate their value and burnt them. Transportation Railway station: Nieuw Amsterdam The village is located at the train track from Zwolle to Emmen. This track was opened in 1905 and was constructed by the NOLS. Before the train, Nieuw-Amsterdam already had two steam tram connections: the DSM station was opened in 1899 and the EDS station in 1903.

The team included a number of players who had jumped from the National League's Pittsburgh Alleghenys (now the Pittsburgh Pirates), including Hall of Famers Pud Galvin, Ned Hanlon, and Jake Beckley. Hanlon served as the team's manager. Meanwhile, John Tener, who would go on to represent Pittsburgh in the United States Congress and be elected the 25th Governor of Pennsylvania, finished his pitching career with the Burghers in 1890. Later Tener would become the president of the National League, and a director of the Philadelphia Phillies. In its only season, the Burghers finished in 6th place with a 60-68 record. Hall Of Fame first baseman Jake Beckley was a powerhouse slugger for the Burghers. He hit .324 with 10 home runs and 120 RBIs. In addition, he led the PL by hitting 22 triples. But even Beckley's fine work could not overcome the weak hitting of the Pittsburgh team in general. The Burghers finished tied for the worst batting average in the loop with a .260 mark. The team played at the Alleghenies' former home, Exposition Park. The stadium and the team was located in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, which was not incorporated into the city of Pittsburgh until 1907. The area is currently known today as the North Side of Pittsburgh, and the site of Exposition Park was later used for Three Rivers Stadium. In an indirect way, it can be argued that the Burghers, alone among the old Players' League franchises, still exist today. Nearly all of the Alleghenys' stars had jumped to the upstart league. The remains of the Alleghenys made a wretched showing, finishing with what is still the worst record in franchise history (and the second-worst in National League history). The resulting drain on attendance led Alleghenys owner Dennis McKnight to return his franchise to the National League. He then joined the Burghers' ownership group as a minority owner. This group repurchased the Pittsburgh National League franchise under a different corporate name, thus allowing them to legally regain title to most of the players who had bolted to the Players' League a year earlier. It is this franchise that forms the current ownership lineage of today's Pirates. In fact, the Pirates nickname can also be traced back to this Burgher episode. On reacquiring the National League franchise, the new owners scooped up Lou Bierbauer, a second baseman from the Brooklyn Ward's Wonders of the defunct Players' League, inadvertently left off the roster of the American Association's Philadelphia Athletics, who as his prior team claimed his rights. This led an AA official to denounce the Alleghenys' actions as \\"piratical\\"‚Äîan accusation that led the Alleghenys to rename themselves the Pirates for the next season.

Born in Edinburgh, Wagstaff originally studied German language and politics, and graduated from the University of Reading in 1993. Wagstaff worked as a translator and interpreter in the German language before turning to music as a profession in the late 1990s. His interest in language and political history continues to be reflected in much of his music and in his theatre libretti. He came to public attention with the musical John Paul Jones (2001), based on the life of the Scots-born sailor and hero of the American Revolution.The Scotsman, 11 July 2001 Premiered in Edinburgh in 2001, this was the first of the composer's works to reach a significant audience. In it, Wagstaff's eclectic compositional style (which frequently involves the integration of several different styles within one work) began to emerge.The Scotsman S2, 7 July 2001 John Paul Jones was revived as a concert version in 2010 in association with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. The composer began to study musical composition at the University of Edinburgh with Professor Nigel Osborne in 2001, earning a master's degree in music in 2002 and a PhD in 2008. Wagstaff's specific interest in German history, particularly the history of the former German Democratic Republic,The Stage (Festival Supplement), August 2007 is reflected in Treptow for string orchestra (2005), his most-performed work. This piece, which won the 2005 Emre Araci Prize, was inspired by the Soviet War Memorial in Treptow Park in east Berlin. In August 2007, Wagstaff presented his hour-long chamber opera The Turing Test on the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The opera takes its name from the test proposed by the English mathematician Alan Turing for human level intelligence in a machine.The Daily Telegraph (Review of the Year), 15 December 2007 A recording of his Piano Quintet was released in the same year on an album by the Edinburgh Quartet recorded by Calum Malcolm entitled Frontiers and Bridges. In 2011, Wagstaff was commissioned by the Royal Society of Chemistry to compose a new work to celebrate International Year of Chemistry 2011. The trio for clarinet, cello and piano is entitled A Persistent Illusion and was premiered by Hebrides Ensemble on 12 December 2011. In 2013, the composer was commissioned by the University of Edinburgh to write and produce a short opera to celebrate the Tercentenary of its School of Chemistry which fell that year. The resulting work, entitled Breathe Freely, is set during the Second World War and premiered in the Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh) on 24 October 2013 in a production supported by Scottish Opera. A CD recording of the opera was released on the Linn Records label in October 2015. Wagstaff lives and works in his native city. His works are widely performed throughout Scotland and beyond. Wagstaff writes and performs rock music under the name Jules Reed. His cousin is the writer Rich Johnston.

The organization states that its goals (among others) are to \\"promote, diffuse and defend our human, territorial, economic, social, political and cultural rights, as communities and as individuals\\", which are to be accomplished through non- violent community-based action. Decisions within the organization are made through assemblies in which the participants work towards reaching a consensus.New International article, 2002. Their namesake and inspiration is the late early 20th century Mexican anarchist Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, upon whose legacy and principles the organization is based. The CIPO advocates autonomous communities, ending private property and common ownership of land.  Community Organizing  The CIPO-RFM has organised around twenty-six rural communities into small anarchist communities where common ownership and participatory democracy are practiced. If a village expresses interest in the group a delegate from the CIPO-RFM comes to the village and explains how they work before it is put to a vote. In an effort to protect the local environment, the CIPO-RFM has engaged in the sabotage and direct action against wind farms, shrimp farms, eucalyptus plantations and the timber industry. They have also set up corn and coffee worker cooperatives and built schools and hospitals to help the local populations. They have also created a network of autonomous community radio stations to educate people about dangers to the environment and inform the surrounding communities about new industrial projects that would destroy more land. In 2001, the CIPO-RFM defeated the construction of a highway that was part of Plan Puebla Panama. During the Zapatista rebellion of 1994, they shut down transportation lines to slow down the movement of troops, and they also blocked highways and shut down government offices to support the 2006 rebellion throughout Oaxaca.  Alleged harassment  Since its inception in the 1980s the CIPO-RFM has reported experiencing varying levels of harassment and persecution by officials within Oaxaca government and by paramilitaries they suspect of being associated with the Oaxacan state government.Nodo50.org article Members of CIPO-RFM have by their own account faced public defamation, ransacked homes and threats of death.Zmag.org article Several high-profile members of CIPO-RFM now live abroad as political refugees, after having to flee Mexico due to persecution, including allegations of death threats and assassination attempts against them. Exiles include Ra√∫l Gatica, one of the original founding members of CIPO-RFM. Gatica fled Mexico following persecution, including threats upon his life, and has been living in Canada since 2005.Amnesty International Horizons.ca article The Mexican government has also tried to deny resources to CIPO-RFM communities in the hope of starving them out.  Current status  As of September 2006 the membership of CIPO-RFM involves representation from 26 different, mainly indigenous, communities including Chatino, Mixtec, Chinantec, Cuicatec, Zapotec, Mixe, and Trique peoples, and membership numbers total approximately 2000 activists. Though most of the membership of CIPO-RFM is of indigenous origin the organization is also open to non-indigenous people, both from Mexico and abroad, and is supportive of broader grassroots progressive social movements and struggles throughout the world.Zmag.org article from May 2006 The ideas of Ricardo Flores Magon See also * Magonism * Anarchism * Green Anarchism * Anarchism in Mexico * 2006 Oaxaca Protests * Rebel Autonomous Zapatista Municipalities * Libertarian Socialism * Zaachila  References  External links *CIPO-RFM Official site. *An account of reported harassment of the CIPO-RFM in Oaxaca: Sta.

He was one of the prime supporters for a national system of public parks. Life and career Hubbard was taught by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. at Harvard University. He was the first person to earn a degree in landscape architecture. He later joined the Olmsted Brothers Firm in Brookline, Massachusetts. While working for their firm, Hubbard went back to Harvard in 1906 to teach landscape architecture. During his thirty-three years of teaching, he focused on developing the profession of landscape architecture along with regional and city planning. Hubbard used real design problems in his classes, unlike the other professors. He also started a separate school in Harvard for city planning in 1929. The Park von Muskau, officially F√ºrst- P√ºckler-Park. In 1917, Hubbard wrote one of his own textbooks, An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design. Co-authored by Theodora Kimball (his wife and colleague), this book became the standard text for landscape architecture for many years. It was considered the \\"bible\\" at Harvard for landscape architecture students. In his book, Hubbard divides the history of landscape architecture into humanized (formal) and naturalized (informal) styles. It also discusses the changes in European precedents and the use of \\"classical formulae,\\" and emphasizes that modern design is based on a typological and pictorial approach, called the Beaux Arts approach. Many landscape designers started to view this approach as confining and sometimes oblivious to the conditions of society and spatial context. One of Hubbard's main influences was the German prince Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau, and his estate of Muskau. In An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design, Hubbard states that P√ºckler is important not only because of his extensive amount of work as a designer, but also because of his considerable amount of ideological writing on the topic of landscape design. Because of Hubbard's book, P√ºckler's work became known to later generations of American landscape architects. Hubbard was a member of the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 1910, he founded and became the chief editor of their magazine, Landscape Architecture He also founded and became the chief editor of another magazine, City Planning Quarterly, in 1925. Hubbard became the president of the ASLA from 1931 to 1935. He spent twenty years as a planning consultant for the National Park Service, the Federal Housing Authority, and several cities. Hubbard was also an active member of the National Capitol Park and Planning Commission, the President's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership, and the American Academy in Rome. =The Book, An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design= In this book, the Hubbards teach people how to completely understand the landscape design styles. The way is to study the history and the characteristics of the designers and to figure out the influence of their objects, circumstances, and sources. Those conditions really play an important part in landscape design and help to create the designers‚Äô individual styles. In addition to that, the authors generalized about three factors of development of individual styles which are their surroundings, designers‚Äô characters and usages. Those lead the directions and reveal on their designs. Moreover, a strong individual style gives people an impressive image and usually becomes the core of that era. The Hubbards discussed the various styles of landscape design in this book. The Moorish style in Spain‚Äîthe gardens are filled with fruit trees, flowers and water features and encircled by buildings which protect people from outside. The vegetation makes shadows and water can cool the temperature down. Those are necessary for the hot and dry weather in the Moorish gardens. The garden of the Alhambra and the Generaliffe at Granada are the examples of the Moorish style in Spain. The style of the Italian Renaissance and Baroque villas‚Äî the villas were designed for aristocrats and built on the hills with great view. This style is recognized by the adornment of sculptures, water features and complicated axial arrangement. The style of Le N√¥tre‚Äî the buildings and gardens were also designed for great nobles and changed into a large scale. The ornate decorations, symmetry and complicated geometric figures are the main elements of the Le N√¥tre‚Äôs style. Everything in the gardens is formal and ordered. The style of architecture and landscape design reveals the grand power and economy of kings and nobles. In 17th century of Europe, the style of Le N√¥tre led a new stream and was imitated by many countries. For example, Versailles. The Romantic landscape style‚Äî this style is not as formal as the formers been discussed and uses less geometrical shapes and axes. The design shows a simple and natural form. The English cottage style‚Äî this style is much different than others. No beautiful decoration, grand buildings and ornate water fountains, instead of those were small gardens, low buildings and natural environment. The Modern German formal style‚Äî the style also designed in the natural and simple way. The Japanese styles‚Äî the Japanese garden contains more natural materials into its design. Everything in the gardens has its own meaning and combines to create beautiful scenery. It expresses harmonious and peaceful for people to relax and enlighten themselves. =Other books= * Hubbard, Theodora K. (1929).

Mission USCGC Tampa - undergoing refit. As part of the \\"Legacy Fleet\\", Tampa recently underwent a nine-month Mission Effectiveness Project (MEP) at the United States Coast Guard Yard. MEP is designed to extend Tampa's operational life until the deployment of a new line of cutters from the Coast Guard's Deepwater Program. With current and future updates of Deepwater electronics systems, a unique computer system and a modern array of weapons, Tampa is dramatically different from the half-century old vessels it replaced.United States Coast Guard. General info. Tampa is a multi-mission ship with five primary missions: maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, homeland security, national defense and international engagement. SCCS-270 is a computer system that aids in controlling shipboard operations and reduces manning requirements. SCCS-270 receives information from multiple sources and displays it on several monitors on the bridge and in CIC (Combat Information Center). Operators use the displayed information primarily for navigation and to track other vessels and aircraft. This system also allows for the sharing of information with other vessels and commands via a satellite link. Tampa operates primarily in the littoral waters of the United States and throughout the Caribbean to ensure homeland security and enforce immigration, fisheries, customs, and environmental laws, along with the more visible drug interdiction laws. Tampa is a front-line unit in the nation's \\"War on Drugs\\" and has seized numerous drug smuggling vessels. In 1994, Tampa was involved with the rescue and return of several thousand Haitians and Cubans during mass migrations from these nations. In September 2005, following the devastating landfall of Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast of the United States, The crew of the Tampa (on board the Harriet Lane) acted as gatekeeper to the mouth of the Mississippi ensuring the safety and movement of commerce from offshore. Tampa later moved upriver to ensure the safety and security of ports and waterways, and support rescue and recovery operations in downtown New Orleans. Tampa is able to launch, land, and service the Coast Guard's HH-65 Dolphin and MH-68 Stingray helicopters. Safety of shipboard helicopter operations is enhanced with the use of Tampa's dynamic fin stabilizing system, which reduces the roll of the ship. To maintain military readiness, Tampa conducts exercises with the U.S. Navy. This training, which includes ship's weapons exercises, damage control drills, and navigation exercises, ensures that Tampa remains a fully capable naval combatant in a time of war or other hostilities. In 2000, Tampa deployed to South America in support of U.S. Southern Command and participated in UNITAS 41-00, an annual naval exercise between U.S. and South American Forces. In 2004, Tampa deployed to the Mediterranean and Black Sea in support of U.S. European Command and conducted training with numerous friends and allies in the region. In March 2014 the Tampa and the USCGC Richard Etheridge participated in Operation Martillo, an operation to seize illicit drugs.

They have released four studio albums, Heathen Songs (August 2004), The Drought (October 2006), Man, You Should Explode (September 2009) and In on Under near Water (March 2016).  History  The Kill Devil Hills were formed in Fremantle in early 2003 by Brendan Humphries on lead vocals and guitars, Lachlan Gurr on mandolin and banjo, and Steve Joines on vocals and guitar. Initially the trio played \\"bushranger rock\\" and \\"cowpunk\\". The name of the band is derived from the title of a chapter, written by Harry Smith in a book, Invisible Republic: Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes by US music critic Greil Marcus, about Bob Dylan and The Band. In the late 1990s Humphries had been a member of Gutterville Splendour Six, alongside Gareth Liddiard and Rui Pereira of the Drones, which issued a self-titled extended play in 1998. The Kill Devil Hills were soon joined by Steve Gibson on percussion and drums. The Kill Devil Hills released their debut album, Heathen Songs, in August 2004 and nationally in February 2005 on the Reverberation label. Michael Inglis of FasterLouder felt that \\"While the album has its dull moments, the Kill Devil Hills have come up with a coherant debut album that asserts the band's identity. At the same time, there are enough standout tracks to make this disc worth your hard-earned dollars.\\" In the same month they were nominated for six WAMi Awards, taking home \\"Best Blues/Roots Act\\" and \\"Best Country Music Act\\". National youth radio station, Triple J, picked up the album, with Heathen Songs receiving a lot of airplay on a variety of shows. They were chosen as one of their 'fresh Crop' Artists of 2005. The group featured on Triple J's \\"Like a Version\\" segment and its JTV. They appeared on the Lonely Planet documentary series, \\"Six Degrees\\", broadcast on SBS. The band performed at The West Coast Blues & Roots Festival 2005. Also that year they appeared at Bridgetown Blues Festival, where they played on stages supporting The Black Keys, The Mountain Goats, The Living End, Dallas Crane, The Mess Hall, Kim Salmon, Jebediah, The Panics and The Drones. The band undertook a short tour of the east coast in May and were invited back to Sydney for shows in November the same year. 2006 saw the band taking time to record a new album, spending most of this year in the studio, with plans to release the new record in October. They were also nominated for another 4 WAMi Awards (winning for the second year in a row - \\"Best Blues/Roots Act\\" and \\"Best Country Music Act\\"), they performed on the local stage at The Big Day Out, were asked to record a live set for Triple J's 'Home and Hosed', and were invited back to The Bridgetown Blues Festival , where they played with The Beasts of Bourbon and Dirty Three. The band's second album, The Drought was released 7 October 2006 and was followed by a national tour. The Kill Devil Hills also released a limited edition vinyl import version of Heathen Songs through Spanish record label Bang! Records (a Spanish label which has many other underground Australian bands on its roster). The Kill Devil Hills returned to the studio in early 2009 to record their third studio album, Man, You Should Explode, produced by Burke Reid. It was released nationally on 5 September 2009 on Torn and Frayed (distributed by Shock). The album was given a four-star review in Rolling Stone magazine, where it was described as \\"a new flawless record\\" and \\"one of the best of 2010\\". The band also embarked on a two-month European tour in late 2010 with the European release of Man, You Should Explode on vinyl through the Spanish label, Bang! Records. In October 2013 the band released its first live album, Past and Future Ghosts, which was recorded in March that year at the Fremantle Arts Centre. The album contained songs from their first three albums, together with two previously unreleased songs. In March 2016, they issued their fourth studio album, In on Under near Water, which Kate Hennessy of The Guardian listed as one of ten \\"essential releases from the Australian underground\\". She described it as \\"a brilliant showcase of what the Devils do best...

He also wrote numerous books, including A Vision of the Aquarian Age (1977), Operation Redemption (1981), Summons to a High Crusade (1985) and finally Exploration into God (1991). He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1982 for \\"educating the adult spirit to a new non-materialistic vision of human nature.\\" Early life and education Trevelyan was the eldest child of Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet, and Mary Katherine Bell, a younger half-sister of Gertrude Bell and the daughter of Sir Thomas Bell, 2nd Baronet. He was proud of this ancestry, which he imagined linked him to Sir Trevillian, one of King Arthur's knights, who swam ashore on horseback when Lyonesse finally sank. Legend says that Sir Trevillian emerged with a mighty effort from the waves and landed safely on the dry land of Cornwall. He grew up in his family's Northumberland home, Wallington Hall, which his father gave to the National Trust, effectively disinheriting Trevelyan. He studied at Sidcot School, a Quaker school in Somerset.George Trevelyan, Baronet, 89; Eclectic Proponent of 'New Age', Eric Pace, The New York Times, February 18, 1996 In 1925, he went to read history at Trinity College, Cambridge, in accordance with family tradition. Whilst there he began his 42-year-long association with the famous 'Trevelyan Man Hunt', an extraordinary annual event which involved a chase on foot over the wild Lakeland fells, with human 'hunters' hunting after human 'hares'. This energetic event was started in 1898 by Trevlyan's historian uncle G. M. Trevelyan and the Wynthrop Youngs, and still continues today, as a kind of hide and seek game without dogs or weapons. Career After leaving Cambridge, Trevelyan went on to teach at Gordonstoun, which at that time was a school pioneering a radical education. Later, he became involved as a teacher of the Alexander Technique for postural integration, and apprenticed himself to a furniture designer and master craftsman in wood, Peter Waals, working at Waals' workshop in the Cotswold hills. Trevelyan himself made many fine pieces of furniture, including a bed in which he finally died, as he wished. In 1931, Trevelyan took the first class F. Matthias Alexander gave for future teachers of the Alexander Technique. In 1942, after hearing a lecture given by Dr Walter Stein, a student of Rudolf Steiner, Trevelyan discovered a spiritual world-view.B J Nesfield-Cookson, \\"Rudolf Steiner\\" from Sir George Trevelyan: thoughts and writings During his lifetime he explored beliefs in angels, the calming effects of crystals and the power of ley lines, alongside organic farming and communal living. In 1947, after his wartime military service, Trevelyan was appointed Warden and Principal of Attingham Park, an adult training college in Shropshire, where he carried out his pioneering work in the teaching of spiritual knowledge as adult education. The courses ranged from chamber music and drama onto esoteric subjects such as 'Finding the Inner Teacher' and 'Holistic Vision'. The latter attracting large numbers of participants, many of them from other countries as well as Britain. The college was jointly sponsored by the local authority and the University of Birmingham, both of whom looked askance at Trevelyan's attraction towards the mystical; and so it took immense moral courage, for instance, for him to present a course on 'Death and Becoming', a subject that was in those days virtually taboo. He was involved in the establishment of the Findhorn Foundation, the Gatekeeper Trust, and through his friendship with Wellesley Tudor Pole, the Chalice Well and the Lamplighter Movement. In 1971, he set up the Wrekin Trust to promote spiritual education and knowledge In 1982, he was a recipient of the Right Livelihood Award. Personal life He married Helen Lindsay-Smith (died 1994) in 1940, and the couple had an adopted daughter.

It is a subspecies of the black rhinoceros. Its numbers are very low due to poaching for its horn and it is listed as critically endangered.  Description  The eastern black rhino is distinguishable from the southern subspecies as it has a longer, leaner, and more curved horn. Its skin is also very grooved. Diceros bicornis michaeli is also reportedly more aggressive than the other three subspecies of black rhino. They are browsers and are usually found in highland forest and savanna habitat.  Population and threats  Once located in Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, and Kenya, as of 2017 they can only be found in Kenya (594 animals), Rwanda and in northern Tanzania (80 animals). A population of currently 60 animals is kept outside its natural range in South Africa (Addo Elephant National Park). The population has declined 90% in the last three generations. In 2010 their total numbers were estimated at 740 animals, with an increasing trend. They are threatened mainly from illegal poaching for their horns. The IUCN figures for Diceros bicornis michaeli also include those for black rhinos from South Sudan, Uganda, southwestern Ethiopia, and western Kenya. These are referred to a separate subspecies (Diceros bicornis ladoensis) by some authorities. As the black rhino is extirpated in most of these areas, the status of the latter subspecies is unclear. Some animals of the Kenyan population may belong to it. Only found in Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania, the Eastern Black Rhino faces a struggle with evolutionary characteristics of its being. The Rhino was examined by Benson and others through the Kenya Wildlife Service and had an article published by the African Journal of Ecology (Benson, 1,791). Each individual Rhino‚Äôs relationship concerning ‚Äúdensity dependence...sex ratio, and underlying growth rates‚Äù was the team‚Äôs main focus. The Rhino began increasing its population growth to the point when growth rate was nonexistent. Rhinos are currently ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù under the Conservation Status for a number of factors but mainly due to illegal poaching. The 90% decline in their population is a hazard as they see mortality rates increase, as well as consistent emigration (Primack, 2002). The reason why the Rhino increases its densities and their birth rate decreases is because of the continuous threat of poaching and emigration. Sex ratio brings about reproduction issues because the male numbers begin to dominate, leaving too low of a number of females to allow positive, consistent birth and growth rates (Benson, 2, 792).

It was written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. This episode is also known as \\"The Existence of Rolf Harris\\" and \\"Pied Piper Goodies versus the Rolf Harris Plague\\". Plot When they lose their main attraction, Tony Blackburn, the Goodies have to come up with another star attraction to replace him in \\"The Goodies *Star* Safari Park\\". After considering and rejecting other big-time show names, they eventually decide on Rolf Harris, with Bill, reading the \\"Observers Book of Stars\\", \\"Rolf Harris -- number of legs, variable\\" (a reference to Harris' song Jake the Peg). According to the book, Rolf Harris is an all-round entertainer whose natural habitat is Australia. The Goodies' arrival in Australia is marked by photos of the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge -- also seen are a kangaroo, koalas and kookaburras. The Goodies go into the \\"Pom's Outfitters\\" shop and reappear with cork hats -- Bill's hat still has the bottles attached to the corks. Noticing headlines in a newspaper stating that Rolf Harris had been seen in the Outback, the Goodies go there in search of their quarry (to the strains of \\"Waltzing Matilda\\"). When they get Rolf Harris back to their safari park in England, he is unhappy. Graeme comments that there used to be thousands of Rolf Harrises all over Australia, but that there were probably only a half dozen left now - \\"it was the beards they were after\\". However, there was another Rolf Harris in captivity, in the Moscow Zoo, which Graeme had arranged to have delivered to the safari park in the hope that they would breed -- and, a year later, in the \\"Rolfus Harriscus\\" enclosure, a baby Rolf Harris can be seen. All goes well until the Rolf Harrises escape from the safari park. The Goodies are upset at losing their latest star attractions, and are also very worried -- Rolf Harrises used to be all over Australia, and they were prolific breeders. Another year has passed, and England is overrun by millions of Rolf Harrises who proceed to make life uncomfortable for other people by their actions -- including frightening small babies in their prams, taking over television broadcasts and completely dominating some sports teams. The Rolf Harrises also constantly splash paint everywhere (even onto people) and sing \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\\", accompanied by wobbleboards. They can lay Ostrich eggs and show one laying an egg inside a gentleman's bowler hat, and then slamming the hat down on the gentleman's head, then slapping the top and crushing the egg, then lifting the hat and splashing him with yolk over his face and suit, and then slamming the hat back down on his yolked head. An anonymous Queen makes a proclamation -- whosoever could rid England of the Rolf Harrises could marry her eldest son (Prince Charles), or receive a thousand OBEs. The Goodies dress like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, and play didgeridoos. It works and soon all of the Rolf Harrises follow the Goodies to the other side, Associated Television, where they are shut in, forever, never to be seen again ... except for one; as in the original children's tale, one \\"crippled boy\\" could not keep up with the other children and avoided their fate, here represented by Rolf Harris' popular children's character Jake the Peg, who has three legs.

However, Rolf Harris has commented that he would have offered to be in this episode, himself, if he had known about it beforehand. DVD and VHS releases This episode has been released on VHS.

It is the only high school in Riverview, and one of four Anglophone high schools in Greater Moncton. History The school was founded in September 1978 starting with two Grade 10 classes. Prior to that date Grades 10 through 12 from the then community of Riverview Heights attended Moncton High School. From its beginnings until 1978, the high school was located at 45 Devere Road, now the site of Riverview Middle School. In 1978 a new facility was opened on an 18-hectare site about two kilometres west of the old school (which became Riverview Middle School). The new school also has a swimming pool, a feature the old school did not possess. In 2006 the auditorium began to operate independently for community use and plays host to many different shows each year, including a Stereos/The Midway State concert in November 2009. The most recent play was a take on Disney's Broadway classics, put on by students at the school.(2018) with the upcoming play being rendition of the Sound of Music.

The highway is a loop connected to M-22 at both ends that allows tourists access to Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive located on a section of sandy forest land between Lake Michigan and Glen Lake. The trunkline traverses an area named the \\"Most Beautiful Place in America\\" by Good Morning America, the morning show on ABC. The highway was designated by 1929 and fully paved in 1939. Route description M-109 starts at an intersection on M-22 north of Empire. The trunkline runs northward along Dune Highway past Maple Grove Cemetery and through woods in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The area was named the \\"Most Beautiful Place in America\\" by Good Morning America in August 2011; the designation came after a social media campaign to capitalize on the show's website poll. Further north, the highway passes the entrance to Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive before running along the western shore of Glen Lake. Near the northwestern corner of the lake, M-109 passes the entrance to the Dune Climb in an area that's predominantly fields. The trunkline makes a 90-degree turn at the intersection with Glen Haven Road, the former M-209, south of Glen Haven, a former logging town on the shores of Lake Michigan. M-109 turns easterly at the intersection to follow Harbor Highway. It runs through another wooded area between Glen Lake and Sleeping Bear Bay. The highway passes the D.H. Day Campground and enters Glen Arbor, following Western Avenue. At the intersection with M-22 (Ray Street), M-109 terminates in the middle of town. M-109 bisects the two bodies of water (Glen Lake) in the foreground, Sleeping Bear Bay of Lake Michigan in the background Like other state highways in Michigan, M-109 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 783 vehicles used the highway daily along Dune Highway and 758 vehicles did so each day along Harbor Highway, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of M-109 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History The first section of roadway to receive the M-109 designation was in place and signed on maps by May 1, 1929. The roadway was a spur from M-22 north of Empire that ended at Glen Haven, just west of the D.H. Day State Park. The highway was extended east along an existing road between Glen Haven and Glen Arbor. This extension was in place by May 1, 1933, completing the modern routing of M-109.

The CRT, ratified by the United States and Canada in 1964, led to the construction of three storage dams in the Basin (the Duncan, Keenleyside and Mica dams) and one in Montana (Libby Dam). The purpose of these dams was flood control and power production in both countries. Most of the benefits of the CRT were enjoyed by areas outside the Basin while most of the negative effects were, and still are, felt by the Basin.\\"The Basin\\" is used locally to refer to the Canadian portion of the Columbia River Basin and not the American portion http://thebasin.ourtrust.org/ There was a lack of prior consultation with the people of the Basin, including the 2,300 residents who were displaced by flooding of their communities and farms. The people of the Basin came together in the early 1990s to press the Province for recognition of the injustice of this situation. Local governments in the Basin coordinated their efforts at the regional district and tribal council level under the Columbia River Treaty Committee, which first met in 1992. The Committee, in partnership with elected officials from the region, negotiated with the Province. They had two objectives: # The creation of a trust governed by a board of Basin residents. # The allocation to the region of funds representing a fair share of the ongoing downstream benefits earned under the CRT, to be managed by the trust. On both counts negotiations were successful and Columbia Basin Trust was formed. Columbia Basin Trust received a $295 million endowment by the Province. # $250 million is committed to finance power project construction. # As directed by Basin residents, $45 million is being reinvested for the benefit of Basin residents through short-term cash investments, business loans, real estate ownership, and venture capital projects. # In addition, Columbia Basin Trust receives $2 million per year from 1996 to 2012. The Province further committed to transfer $250 million to the Columbia Power Corporation (CPC), Columbia Basin Trust's Joint Venture Partner in power projects in the Basin. Fifty per cent of the net profits go to Columbia Basin Trust for the benefit of the people of the Basin. The income from the investments is being spent on social, economic and environmental benefits for the residents of the Basin.

The highway was a spur that provided access from US Highway 31 (US 31) to Orchard Beach State Park. The highway was designated in 1927 and lasted until 2003. Route description The southern terminus of M-110 was at a junction with US 31 near Parkdale on the northern boundary of the city of Manistee. From there, the trunkline traveled north along Lake Shore Road near Lake Michigan. Along the way, the highway passed through the unincorporated community of Parkdale. The landscape contains fields as the roadway approaches the forest at Orchard Beach State Park. M-110 continues past the park and terminated at an intersection with Kott Road. History A highway was first designated along Lakeshore Road in 1927 bearing the M-110 designation. In 2003, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) transferred M-110 to the Manistee County Road Commission. In the last traffic surveys before the transfer, MDOT determined that an average of 2,335 vehicles used M-110 on a daily basis in 2002.

It has a grayish-brown facial disc, edged by narrow white eyebrows and a band of white across the throat.

Native to both the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, it's found in tropical or subtropical moist forests in lowlands and foothills, up to an altitude of above sea level. It is nocturnal, hunting primarily insects and small vertebrates. By day, it roosts either in a cavity or in the main fork of a tree. Although the global population has not been quantified, it's reported to be widespread and common within its restricted range. The population trend appears to be stable, though small numbers of both adults and juveniles are known to be taken from the wild to serve as pets.

The Company was a force behind early electronic organs for the home. It went out of business in 1979 but reopened in 1996. Overview =Founding= Founded by Canadian Edward G. Thomas as the \\"Thomas Organ & Piano Co.\\" in Woodstock, Ontario in 1875, the company's first instruments were pipe organs, moving later to pump organs. In the early 1950s, Thomas George invented the Thomas electronic organ with its single manual and ten stops. Thomas reorganized the company in 1956 into the Thomas Organ Company of Sepulveda, California. =Notability= Unlike later electronic organs with conventional tab stops, early Thomas electronic organs utilized a dial control for their stops, presumably to add a certain familiarity to its users since the dials worked much like those on a radio or television. This may be evidenced by the introduction of the Talking Organ with its \\"Built-In Teacher,\\" a phonograph intended for use with instructional recordings. =Popularity= Chordovox CDX-0652 with Moog synthesizer on upper manual, manufactured by Thomas Organ (1976) Cry Baby (1970), also distributed under Vox brand The 1960s had the Thomas Organ Company at the height of its popularity. The company became the importer of the English-made Vox combo, the electronics of which would turn up in Thomas models. Thomas also took over manufacturing rights of the Moog synthesizer and enjoyed heavy celebrity endorsement from the likes of Lawrence Welk, whose organist Bob Ralston both played a Thomas on The Lawrence Welk Show and on tour at organ and piano shops to demonstrate the greatly improved tonal quality of the new models, and Lucille Ball, who featured a Thomas on at least one episode of The Lucy Show. Welk had a high- end model named after him in 1968, the aforementioned Lawrence Welk spinet model. Joe Benaron was President of Thomas during its heyday. Ennio Unchini was the Italian importer. Features \\"Band Master\\" Polyphonic Synthesizer on Thomas 2001 Like most American furniture of the 1950s, early electronic organs were massive affairs; indeed, the company's largest market was the home market. Thomas' introduction of the \\"streamlined\\" console and the introduction of solid state electronics made Thomas the preeminent manufacturer of home organs. That latter introduction to the Thomas line led to developments much like those found of synthesizers of later years; one later version, the 1973 Monticello, actually incorporated a synthesizer in its upper manual which actually was a moog synthesizer. It was found on the MONTICELLO Models 371 & 372 and also on the CELEBRITY Model 871. *Repeat Percussion - Playable from either manual, Repeat Percussion emulated the sound of percussive instruments such as a marimba or banjo. The repeat rate was easily adjusted via a thumbwheel on most models and rotary control on smaller models such as the AR1 *Vibra-Magic - This innovative feature allowed sustained notes to have gradual vibrato added, again at a setting that could be determined by the organist. Other makers soon followed, giving their variations the more generic name of \\"delayed vibrato\\" or similar name *Leslie speaker - This rapidly spinning speaker, located in its own cabinet within the organ's console, added depth to the otherwise relatively flat sounds generated by the oscillators. Leslie speakers were not an invention of Thomas but were certainly used by them. *Band Box - This predecessor to the modern drum machine recreated rhythms from a simple foxtrot to a bossa nova, with individual percussion instruments added by the organist via rocker switches. These individual instruments had the aforementioned Repeat Percussion feature allowing the sound of a drum roll or maracas. They also had their own individual triggers, allowing the organist to recreate rimshots, cymbal crashes and even the pop and fizz of a champagne bottle either via buttons on the control panel, at the lower manual or at the pedal board =Color-Glo system= Thomas 2001 playing Another innovation during its heyday was Color-Glo, an instructional system which illuminated the keys of the manuals (and therefore their corresponding notes in reverse relief) from behind with fluorescent lights. The lower manual had black, green, and red colored bands behind the notes necessary to play a second- inversion C, a first-inversion F and a root-position G. The C, F and G pedals had colored bands across their tips corresponding to the chords. The idea was that a rank beginner could create music simply by following the very simple music books that featured lettered noteheads and color-coded chords. \\"Matching the colors\\" was sufficient to play full-sounding four-voice chords. Thomas's three-volume course Color-Glo Plus: A Sound For Everyone introduced \\"three simple rules\\" that allowed for more chords, by changing the pedal notes and/or specifying a manual note to raise or lower. The chord's letter name indicated the pedal to play, while as before, the color-coding specified the basic C, F, or G chord shape on the lower manual. Note name stickers were provided for the pedals. These extended rules allowed for chords such as (black) Am7, +A7, and ‚àíCm; (green) Dm7, +D7, and ‚àíFm; and (red) Em7, +E7, and -Gm. The height of any + or - before the chord symbol showed which note to raise or lower. Product lines Thomas Californian 253 (c.1971) These features and others were incorporated across the product line throughout the 1960s, including small, relatively inexpensive spinet models with 37-note manuals (the AR1) and a unique \\"arc\\" 13-note pedal board, another Thomas Organ innovation, although one which was too narrow to allow true heel-toe playing. Thomas however did lengthen the pedals to enable theoretically at least heel and toe playing. Especially remarkable was the fact that the spinets started around US$500. Larger models included the Concert Serenade and the Lawrence Welk, each with two 44-note manuals and a 25-note pedal board. Larger still were the Celebrity with two 61-note manuals and a 32-note pedal board (revised to a 25-note version in later editions), the American Guild of Organists-compliant Impresario theatre organ, the Model 710 church organ and the Model 900-series 3-manual theatre organ. Popular kit versions were made available via Heathkit and fully assembled versions under the Silvertone brand were sold by Sears, Roebuck and Company.

Plot summary The starship Gloria Mundi, built and manned by the United States of Europe, lands on the planet Altair Five in the year 2032. When part of the crew ventures out to explore the region around their touchdown point, their radio communication soon ceases and they do not return. Three of the crew sent to rescue their mates vanish within hours. Of the three remaining, all of whom are captured after they finally leave the ship in search of the missing, only psychiatrist Paul Marlow, the book's protagonist, survives. The planet is inhabited by primeval humanoids. A central theme in the novel is the clash between Marlowe's rational worldview and the indigenous peoples' superstitious and often brutal culture. His name is pronounced Poul Mer Lo by the Bayani tribe he lives amongst; he gains a leading position in the primitive society. Marlow eventually goes on a journey which has the result of demystifying the natives' religion by discovering its factual origin - thereby uncovering that the humans of Altair Five share their ancestry with humans of Earth and of other worlds in the Milky Way. When he returns from this journey, he is raised to the most powerful position within the society. Marlow uses this power to educate the alien race; he introduces them to writing, to transforming Earth inventions such as the wheel, the ball- bearing and the axle, and to better industrial and agricultural methods. While throughout his stay on this world, Marlow has longed to go home, he reaches a point where he adapts to the simplicity and naivety of the Bayani lifestyle, and starts seeing the complexities of Earth as absurd. When, after less than three Altair Five years, he is contacted by a starship and rescue is imminent, he decides to stay in spite of a specific fate which awaits him.

An animal can be awarded the PDSA Gold Medal if it assists in saving human or non-human life when its own life is in danger or through exceptional devotion to duty. The medal can also be awarded to animals in public service, such as police or rescue dogs, if the animal dies or suffers serious injury while carrying out its official duties in the face of armed and violent opposition. The first ceremony, in November 2002, saw the Gold medal awarded to three dogs, including Endal, an assistance dog whose actions helped to save the life of his disabled owner. , the PDSA Gold Medal has been awarded in total 28 times. All recipients were dogs until 2020, when a mine-sniffing rat received the prize. The majority of recipients have been British.

As a player, he scored 144 goals from 221 appearances in the Football League playing for Leeds United, Huddersfield Town, Birmingham, West Ham United, Millwall and Queens Park Rangers. He was manager of Queens Park Rangers for eight years. Football career =Playing career= Born in Wigan, Lancashire, Mangnall was a busy and athletic centre-forward who played for Leeds United between 1927 and 1930. After playing with First Division Huddersfield Town until 1934, he joined Birmingham. He was then signed by West Ham United in 1935 as a replacement for Vic Watson. He scored 25 goals in 35 League appearances for the Hammers and was their top scorer for the 1935‚Äì36 season, but moved to Millwall the following year. Mangnall helped Millwall, who were competing in the Third Division South at the time, into the FA Cup semi-finals in 1937. Millwall's giant-killing feats earned Mangnall the title of, David the Giant Killer as a procession of clubs came to The Old Den and were devoured by The Lions. Following a 6‚Äì1 victory away to Aldershot in which Magnall scored 4 goals, Millwall were drawn at home in every round. After a 7‚Äì0 defeat of Gateshead, it was the turn of Second Division Fulham. Millwall sent them packing 2‚Äì0. First Division Chelsea were the next team to try their luck at The Den. Chelsea were more embarrassed than Fulham when Mangnall's Millwall sent them home 3‚Äì0. Derby County, the First Division runners-up the previous season, were the next team to visit. Millwall's record crowd of 48,672 packed into The Den to watch Mangnall score first, with his striking partner McCartney netting the winner four minutes from time. However, when Millwall drew Manchester City, nobody thought they even had a chance of beating them. Millwall got the better of City's star studded team, with Mangnall scoring a goal in each half, making Millwall the first Third Division team in the history of the competition to reach the semi-final. Millwall's dream was ended when they were paired with Sunderland in the semi-final, played at neutral Leeds Road and although Magnall scored yet again, The Lions went down 2‚Äì1. There was some consolation for Mangnall's Millwall as they won promotion to the Second Division the following season.The Sunday Times Illustrated History of Football Reed International Books Limited 1996 p60. =Management career= On 16 May 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, he joined Queens Park Rangers as a player and on 29 April 1944 was offered the player-manager role. Although initially reluctant to take it on, he did so, and he built a team that in the 1947‚Äì48 season, with George Smith as captain, won the Third Division South championship by four points to give QPR their first-ever promotion. After four tough seasons in the Second Division they were relegated back to the Third Division, where they were to remain for fifteen seasons before Alec Stock led them to promotion again. After relegation in 1951‚Äì52, Mangnall left the club and never managed in the Football League again. He is one of only six QPR managers to achieve a promotion to a higher division, the others being Alec Stock (who managed the feat twice, in successive seasons), Gordon Jago, Terry Venables, Ian Holloway and Neil Warnock.

The national system is mostly operated by the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo, SNCC. Not all rail lines link up, but are generally connected by river transport. The rail systems are listed below.Railways in Southern Africa. This source does not distinguish between operational and non-functioning lines.UNJLC Map number: UNJLC DRC 001 (7 MB) .

Routes * Matadi- Kinshasa Railway: From Matadi Harbour to Kinshasa via Songolo, Kimpese, Mbanza-Ngungu and Kasangulu, operated by ONATRA, gauge, originally constructed as gauge; three trains a week. * In 1928, Congo (Belgium) and Angola (Portugal) did a land exchange to facilitate the new route of the railway to Kinshasa. [Railways Africa 2014 issue 5, p29] This line is a bypass of the Livingstone Falls on the Congo River, known as a portage railway. Upstream from the Kinshasa river port, water transport reaches about two-thirds of the country. The line lost traffic to road transport when the Matadi-Kinshasa road was re-established in 2000, and it is now planned to revitalize it with Chinese help.Le Potentiel, 16 August 2006. An agreement was signed in July 2006 between ONATRA and a Chinese company (CMIC) which will renovate the track, trains, telecommunications, signal system and electric supply. The line reopened in September 2015 after around a decade without regular service. As of April 2016 there was one passenger trip per week along the line and more frequent service was planned. * Vicicongo line: Bumba (Congo river port) - Aketi - Buta - Likati - Isiro - Mungbere, with branch lines to Bondo and Titule; narrow gauge. The line was opened by Chemins de Fer Vicicongo in 1923 and is 1235 km (741 mi) long.Durrant, A.E., A.A. Jorgensen, C.P. Lewis. Steam in Africa, London, 1981, Hamlyn. * Great lakes line first section: Kisangani (Congo River port) to Ubundu (upper Congo River port), .www.bck-kdl.be/Ligne Stanleyville-Ponthierville This line is a bypass (portage railway) of the Stanley Falls on the Congo River. A train runs after arrival at Kisangani of a ship from Kinshasa or before departure of a ship to Kinshasa, which may happen about every 2 to 3 month, no fixed schedule. There is no connecting boat service between Ubundu and Kindu on the Lualaba River (the upper Congo). * Great lakes line second section: Kindu (Lualaba River port) - Kibombo ‚Äì Kongolo ‚Äì Kabalo (Lualaba River port and junction with Katanga line) - Nyunzu ‚Äì Niemba ‚Äì Kalemie (the port on Lake Tanganyika), . This line was gauge like the first section until 1955, when the gauge was changed for the connection with the Katanga line in 1956. Just north of Kongolo, the Lualaba is unnavigable due to the rapids named Portes D'Enfer ('Gates of Hell'). The track between Kalemie and Niemba is described by UNJLC in 2006 as 'very degraded' and may not be operational. Boats to Moba and Kalundu-Uvira on Lake Tanganyika used to connect with trains at Kalemie. In 1917 a train ferry was introduced on the lake operating from Kalemie, but is long gone. * Katanga line: Kabalo (Lualaba River port and junction with Great Lakes line) ‚Äì Kamungu - Katumba ‚Äì Kabongo (or a town 8 km south-east) ‚Äì Kamina (junction with Kasia line) - Bukama (Lualaba River port) ‚Äì Tenke (junction with Benguela Railway) - Likasi ‚Äì Lubumbashi - Sakania - Zambia, . There are a number of short branch lines in the mining areas between Tenke and Kolwezi. The section from near Kabongo to Kamina was described by UNJLC in 2006 as 'very degraded'. Kamina - Lubumbashi section will be straighter, fully grade-separated route to use track gauge in July 2019 and fully electrified with minimum overhead wiring height at 6.75m above top of the rails. However, this will make break-of-gauge (1520mm/1435mm) creation at several junctions (to Kenya, to Mozambique, and to Angola) and northern border region. * Kasai line: Ilebo (Kasai River port) ‚Äì Kananga ‚Äì Mwene Ditu ‚Äì Kaniama - Kamina (junction with Katanga line), . This connects the Katanga line to the river port at Ilebo from where boats can reach Kinshasa. Freight is transferred to river barges, but in 2006 UNJLC reports the river service operates sporadically. On 1 August 2007 a passenger train ran out of control on the line 170 km north-west of Kananga and 7 coaches overturned, killing about 100 people. * Katanga-Benguela line: A branch of the Katanga Railway was built from Tenke junction just north-west of Likasi via Kolwezi to Dilolo at the Angolan border to connect with the Benguela Railway from Luau to the Atlantic port of Lobito. This allowed through passenger trains to run between Lubumbashi and Lobito, and freight trains to carry copper from the Zambian and Katangan Copperbelts to a seaport for the export of copper. It was this purpose which provided the investment for the Benguela Railway. It did not operate through Angola from the 1970s, due to the civil war there. The line between Kolwezi and Dilolo was described by UNJLC in 2006 as 'very degraded'. It reopened in 2018. The following lines have been completely removed and are not listed for future rehabilitation: * Mayumbe line: Boma to Tshela, 1889‚Äì1984, gauge, 137 km long and opened in stages from 1901 to 1913. removed in 1984.Closed \\"owing to its lack of profitability\\" (Inter Rail No. 2/1997); Mobutu also closed the bank branches and industry in this region (Le Potentiel No. 3700/2006). * Kivu Railway: Kalundu-Uvira-Kamaniola (- Bukavu), 1931‚Äì1958, .Blanchart, Charles: Le Rail au Congo Belge 1920‚Äì1945.

This link is currently not operating: * Angola - yes - same gauge - . The link to the ports of Benguela and Lobito was unusable from the 1970s, but has been rehabilitated. The Angolan transport minister Augusto Tom√°s promised the reconstruction up to the border station at Luau in Moxico province by the end of 2012. The focus was then be on the line from Dilolo to Kolwezi. The line reopened in 2018. * In 2012, Angola started plans for a line from Luanda via the Matadi Bridge to the enclave of Cabinda province which necessarily crosses Congo territory, with a junction with Congo's Matadi- Kinshasa Railway. There are boat links to rail lines in these neighbouring countries: * Republic of Congo - no direct link, but ordinary ferries across the Congo River from Kinshasa to Brazzaville can take passengers and freight to the Congo-Ocean Railway (same gauge ) which runs from Brazzaville to the Atlantic port of Pointe Noire. * Tanzania - no direct link but boats take freight between Kalemie and Kigoma, from where Tanzania's Central Line runs to the seaport of Dar es Salaam; there once was a train ferry from Kalemie built in 1917; break of gauge /.

Criticism The rail network in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has experienced numerous accidents due to poor maintenance. The death toll is frequently high, partly due to the practice of train surfing. A major accident in August 2007 lead to the deaths of over 100 people at Benaleka, Kasai- Occidental. In April 2014, 48 people were killed and 160 injured when an SNCC train derailed near Katongola, Katanga Province. 33 were killed in a further incident in November 2017 near Lubudi, Lualaba Province. 32 were killed in an accident in Kasai Province in March 2019. In September 2019 at least 50 persons died as a result of a derailment in Tanganyika.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-accident-idUSKCN1VX19T Locomotives On 3 November 2008, four diesel-electric locomotives were supplied to the DRC from China.

The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by actress Ellen Pompeo. Meredith is the series' protagonist and title character, and was introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital (later Seattle Grace-Mercy West Hospital, and afterwards Grey+Sloan Memorial), eventually obtaining the position of a surgical resident, and later the position of an attending, and in 2015, attaining the Chief of General Surgery position. As the daughter of world-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, Meredith struggles with the everyday life of being in a competitive profession, maintaining the relationship with her one-night stand and eventual husband Derek Shepherd, her motherhood, and her friendships with her colleagues. Meredith is the narrator of the show and serves as the focal point for most episodes. Pompeo's connection with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd) is acclaimed as a high point of the series. Rhimes has characterized Meredith as not believing in good or bad, but instead doing what she thinks is right. Grey has been positively received by television critics, with Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times referring to her as \\"the heroine of Grey's Anatomy\\". Pompeo's performance has been well received throughout the show and the character has gained widespread popularity worldwide. Pompeo has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of the character in the long running ABC medical drama including Satellite Award for Best Actress and multiple nominations at the People's Choice Awards for Best Actress winning at 39th People's Choice Awards in 2013 and again in 2015 at 41st People's Choice Awards, Pompeo has also received a Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series nomination at the 64th Golden Globe Awards.  Storylines and characteristics  Meredith Grey is the daughter of world- renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, and grew up in her shadow. Ellis was a deeply flawed, emotionally and verbally abusive, neglectful mother. Meredith is described as a \\"dark and twisty,\\" damaged person who sees the world in varying shades of gray. Because of this, she is an emotionally complex person. She is capable of empathizing with others when they're at their lowest points, and is a sensitive observer of the people around her. Meredith is a graduate of Dartmouth College. While in college, conflicts with her mother lead Meredith to question her decision to attend medical school. That indecision leads her to make plans to sleep and party her way through Europe once she graduates. However, after a month abroad, Meredith is called back to care for her mother, who has developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. This news drives Meredith's decision to obtain her M.D. The night before Meredith's internship begins, she has a one-night stand with Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), a stranger she meets at Joe's Bar. She discovers the next day that he is a recently hired attending; the new head of neurosurgery at her new workplace, Seattle Grace Hospital. Meredith is assigned to work under resident Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), and befriends her fellow interns, Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) . She is particularly close with Cristina Yang, who becomes her best friend and \\"person\\". Though she initially thinks poorly of him, Alex Karev also evolves into Meredith's \\"person\\" and the two assume a sibling-esque familial relationship. Meredith has a conflicted relationship with Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), the Chief of Surgery at Seattle Grace. Richard was very close to Ellis and even had an affair when Meredith was a child. Due to his relationship with Meredith's mother, he tends to save, mentor and make exceptions for her. Meredith has a habit of \\"collecting strays\\", and allows her friends and coworkers to live in the house her mother left her. Those friends become her pseudo-family. Meredith is endlessly loyal to those she deems her family, and will bend the traditional rules of morality to keep them safe. Having grown up in a hospital, Meredith shows immense natural talent. She possesses a steadfast, calm ease during medical procedures and emergencies, and is a natural observer of people. She exhibits a knack for catching subtle hints and accurately determining difficult-to-catch diagnoses. Her placid, non-judgmental bedside manner often causes people to open up and trust her. Her surgical skills are solidly impressive and she shows a talent and patience for medical research trials and dealing with psychologically damaged patients. Meredith resists Derek's advances throughout her internship, but is eventually charmed into starting a relationship with him despite misgivings about an intern dating an attending. She is, therefore, shocked by the arrival of Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), Derek's wife, unaware that he was married. Derek struggles to choose between the two, but ultimately returns to Addison, despite Meredith begging to be chosen instead. Meredith is devastated and turns to multiple, self-destructive means of coping. Initially she falls on old habits of self-medicating with tequila and sex, and adopts a dog, named Doc. She also tries to resolve some issues by searching for her long-absent father, Thatcher. She learns that her father, who left when she was five and she has not seen since, remarried and had two more daughters. The two do not become close, but Grey becomes fond of her stepmother. Meredith spirals further when Ellis is admitted to the hospital, revealing Ellis' diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's and her verbally abusive tendencies. Meredith self-destructive behavior reaches its most dangerous when she saves a patient with a bomb in their chest by impulsively inserting her hand to hold it until the bomb squad can remove it. Meredith has a series of one-night stands, including one with George, who has long been in love with her. When she cries in the middle of their encounter, their friendship temporarily ends. Meredith swears off her behavior, agrees to be friends only with Shepherd and embarks on a relationship with veterinarian Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell). Derek regrets his decision to return to his wife, and Meredith must decide whether to continue a relationship with Finn, or allow Derek a second chance. When Ellis experiences a rare, completely lucid day, and expresses her immense disappointment at how ordinary Meredith has turned out to be, she becomes depressed and possibly suicidal. During a ferryboat accident, Meredith is knocked into the water and chooses to give up and drown, rather than fight and swim. She flatlines at the hospital, and awakens in an \\"afterlife\\", where she interacts with deceased former acquaintances. Ellis dies in the interim, and Meredith meets with her mother, who tells her that she is anything but ordinary. She undergoes another round of resuscitation at the insistence of Cristina. Derek distances himself from Meredith as the result of her self- recklessness, prompting her to seek therapy to address her problems. Meredith sees a therapist, Dr. Wyatt (Amy Madigan), to seek happiness and begins to successfully tackle her issues. Meredith found her mother's diaries, dredging up old memories and secrets for her to work through. Meanwhile, Meredith nearly fails her intern exam after a drunken Thatcher publicly blames Meredith for the death of his wife, Susan, a distraught Grey sits through her entire test without writing a single answer. Dr. Webber gives her a second chance to do the exam, saving her from destroying her career. After Meredith is promoted to a resident, her younger half-sister Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) begins working at Seattle Grace as an intern. Meredith initially rejects Lexie's attempts to form a relationship, but slowly softens towards her. The sisters are very different people with different childhoods. Lexie had a more idealistic family life and often has difficulty understanding her much darker sister, who does not have the same positive associations with family as Lexie. She later initiates a neurosurgical clinical trial, enlisting Derek as a consulting neurosurgeon. The trial fails repeatedly, but the final patient they treat survives, which leads them to reuniting and moving in together. Their relationship is healthier than before, but still experiences snags as the two attempt to understand each other and navigate what they now look on as a permanent, long-term relationship. Meredith relies heavily on Cristina for emotional support and guidance. Eventually, Derek and Meredith decide to marry, but on their wedding day, the pair give their \\"perfect\\" wedding ceremony to Izzie and Alex, to marry each other during the planned ceremony instead. The development of Grey and Shepherd's relationship, during season three, was disliked among television critics. Meredith and Derek marry by writing their wedding vows on a post-it note. Meredith spends the majority of a season out of commission after donating part of her liver to Thatcher and supporting Cristina's new relationship with Owen Hunt, an army doctor with worrisome PTSD. Meredith experiences another immense trauma after the hospital is put under a lockdown from an active mass-shooter seeking revenge against Derek. Meredith offers her own life in exchange for his and miscarries her baby during the crisis. She goes through this traumatic experience with Cristina, who operates on Derek while threatened at gunpoint. Meredith hides her loss and the trauma psychiatrist refuses to clear neither Cristina nor Meredith for their return to surgery. Meredith is able to work through her issues and become cleared, but Cristina remains deeply traumatized. Meredith covers for and supports her friend through her dark time, but is ultimately unable to fully help her return to surgery. Meredith decides to actively try to become pregnant, but learns that she has a \\"hostile uterus\\", which leads her to consider her other possible genetic flaws. Derek, who is constantly worried about the possibility that she will develop Alzheimer's, initiates a clinical trial hoping to cure the disease. Meredith opts to work on the trial and appears to be leaning towards a neuro specialty. When Webber's wife, Adele, is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, she receives a spot on the trial. Meredith tampers with the drugs so that Adele does not receive the placebo. She and Derek decide to adopt Zola, an orphaned baby from Malawi, and make their marriage legal. When the truth about the tampering comes out, however, a furious Derek tells her he cannot raise a child with her because of her moral ambiguity. Meredith is fired and tries to conceal both this and her marital separation from the adoption counselor in order to keep Zola. Although Dr. Webber steps down as chief of surgery and takes the blame for the trial tampering to protect Meredith, Zola is taken away. She and Derek reconcile. Meredith chooses a general surgery specialty over neuro, and they successfully fight to get Zola back. As her last year of residency is coming to a close, the residents travel around the country, searching for the best jobs in their specialties. In order to finish their residency, the residents must take the medical boards. Meredith takes the exam while sick with the flu. She decides to take a job offer at The Brigham and Women's Hospital as the next step in her career. During a medical flight to undertake a prestigious surgery involving conjoined twins, Meredith, Derek, Cristina, and Lexie, among others, are involved in an aviation accident. The plane crash kills Lexie, and the survivors are trapped in the wooded wilderness for days waiting for help. Following their rescue, Meredith becomes an attending general surgeon at Seattle Grace, now Seattle Grace-Mercy West. While Cristina flees Seattle for her fellowship, Meredith, afraid of flying and change, declines her job offer, and clings to what remains in Seattle. Cristina and Meredith begin calling the hospital Seattle Grace Mercy Death in light of the immense amount of trauma, death, and pain they have experienced there. Meredith's newfound attitude and sarcasm leads to her being dubbed \\"Medusa\\" by the hospital's new batch of interns. In the aftermath of the plane accident, the hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim including Derek, Cristina, Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) and herself must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurance company refuses to pay due to a loophole. The doctors along with Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) buy the hospital with the help of the Harper Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing and become new members of the directing board. Meredith asks Dr. Bailey to perform gene mapping on her to finally know whether she has Alzheimer's genes like her mother. She tests positive for more than one of the genetic markers for the disease. Meredith moves to the completed dream home and sells her house to Alex, who purchases it as the only true home he's ever known. He continues Meredith's tradition of keeping the house open to any \\"strays\\" needing a home. Meredith discovers she is pregnant and gives birth to a son. The baby has face presentation and is consequently delivered via emergency C-section. While stitching Meredith up, the obstetrician who operated on her is called away to another patient and intern Shane Ross completes the stitching. When blood begins to appear from everywhere, Meredith diagnoses herself in as being in DIC. Dr. Bailey performs a spleen removal, which saves her life. In return, Derek and Meredith name their son Bailey. As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited a number times that she did not want to be like either of her parents: her father had followed her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time. Meredith and Derek come to an agreement that he, already established in his career and reputation, would take a step back to take care of the children and allow her to shine. Meredith attempts to regain some ground by starting a promising research trial 3-D printing portal veins. The conflict between Cristina and Meredith widens when Cristina commandeers Meredith's resources for her own trial, ultimately garnering a Harper Avery nomination for Cristina. Cristina and Meredith repair their relationship when Meredith confesses that Cristina was correct, her skills have surpassed Meredith's. Cristina moves to Switzerland take up a job offer from Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), her former attending, mentor and fianc√©, who was looking for a replacement at a research hospital he was running, thus leaving Alex in charge of being Meredith's \\"person\\" in her place, an honor he gladly accepts. Meredith and Derek's marriage becomes strained when Derek goes against his promise and accepts an offer from the U.S. President to participate in the Brain Mapping Initiative, which consumes his time and eclipses Meredith, who is feeling increasingly left behind and mommy-tracked. He receives an offer to head the project itself in Washington D.C., meaning that he would have to be based there permanently. Meredith puts her foot down as she does not want to uproot their young family to move across the country for his career at the sacrifice of her own. They begin a series of on-and-off arguments and \\"cold wars\\" over their careers. Derek accepts the job in the heat of the moment and promptly leaves for Washington. During a phone call with Meredith, they agree to work things out after she tells him that she did not want them to become \\"one of those couples\\" and he reciprocates, saying that he missed her. She privately admits to Alex that she has realized that she could live independently of Derek, but chooses not to. Meredith finds out she has a maternal half-sister named Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) who is now working in Grey Sloan Memorial. Meredith is in denial and rejects Maggie, thinking she would have remembered if her mother was pregnant until she finds a hospital document confirming the revelation. Meredith tries to piece together her relationship with her mother and half-sister by going through old videos of her mother. She eventually recovers her repressed memories of the pregnancy when she views her mother's diary and has a change of heart, choosing to accept Maggie and begin building a relationship. Meredith is widowed when Derek is killed in a car accident and was taken to an understaffed hospital. The doctors failed to recognize his head injury in time and allowed personal conflicts to interfere. Derek is declared brain dead, and Meredith must go to the medical center to consent to remove him from life support, shortly before she's hit with the first waves of morning sickness. She tells Penny, the intern who was assigned to Derek that every doctor has \\"that one\\" patient who dies on their watch and haunts them forever and \\"that one will make you work harder, and they make you better.\\" After Derek's death, Meredith returns to Grey Sloan Memorial to inform the others of his passing. Following the funeral service, Meredith impulsively packs up her belongings and leaves with the children to San Diego. Months pass by while her friends and family are unaware of her whereabouts. Eventually, parallels show similarities in Meredith's and Ellis' lives: Both have lost the love of their life, both run away from Seattle following their loss, and both eventually give birth to a daughter. Meredith names her newborn daughter Ellis after her mother. Although still grieving over Derek, Meredith returns to Seattle with the children and later becomes chief of general surgery. She sells the \\"dream house\\" and moves back to her mother's house, having purchased it back from Alex, and now lives there with Maggie and Amelia Shepherd, her sister-in-law. Meredith hosts a dinner party and at the party Callie brings Penny as a date. Later at the event Meredith finds out Penny will be joining her at Grey Sloan Memorial. Meredith eventually forgives Penny, who becomes her favorite resident over Alex's girlfriend, Jo. Alex and Meredith continue their close, sibling-like relationship of being each other's \\"person\\", despite Jo's displeasure and inability to understand their closeness. He supports her when she is violently attacked by a disoriented patient, and she supports him through his legal difficulties. Alex initiates a weekly family waffle day where he makes waffles for everyone in the house.

Meredith finds herself in another love triangle when Megan rejects Riggs because he is still in love with Meredith, but Meredith pushes them to be together.

Development  = Casting and creation = Pompeo discovered Grey's Anatomy after an extended period of doing nothing in the acting profession. Her agent suggested she audition amongst other projects. While casting actresses for the part of Meredith Grey, series' creator Shonda Rhimes said: \\"I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile, and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from Moonlight Mile.' I spent time with her and got to know her, and then we started casting for the men.\\" She reported that Grey was not an easy role to cast because of the strong verbal possibilities. Rhimes was informed that the actress in question was Pompeo, who had a deal in place with ABC, having previously tested for a pilot on the network. It has been speculated that Pompeo was the first character to be cast, but when asked, she said she did not know of this. When asked of how she created Pompeo's character, Rhimes said: Pompeo was cast as the program's titular character, described by Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times as \\"a prickly, independent sort whose ambition, and ambivalence, is fueled by the fact that her mother was a gifted surgeon and now suffers from Alzheimer's.\\" Grey also serves as the show's narrator, and as such was likened in early reviews to Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), the narrator and protagonist of Sex and the City. After her initial contract with Grey's Anatomy expired, Pompeo negotiated a new one, in which she would be paid US$200,000 per episode, making her and Dempsey the highest-paid cast members on the show. In 2012, Forbes recognized Pompeo as the eighth highest-paid actress on television, with a salary of US$275,000 per episode for her role on Grey's Anatomy. Pompeo's second contract with Grey's Anatomy expired after the eighth season, and speculation arose that she would be leaving subsequently. In September 2011, Pompeo reported that she is open to the idea of extending her contract if invited. She told TV Guide: \\"I would never turn up my nose at [Grey's Anatomy]. As long as the stories are honest and truthful, and Patrick [Dempsey] and I feel there is material for us to be passionate about, it still beats a 9-to-5 job any day. If I hear from the fans that they want us to keep going, then I would continue because we owe them everything.\\" E! Online reported in May 2012, that Pompeo, as well as all original cast members, have signed on for two more years. With the Huffington Post announcement of season nine having officially been renewed, the contract is set into place for Pompeo to return. Pompeo's contract expired again at the end of the twelfth season. She signed a new contract to keep her in the starring role on the series for the thirteenth season. According to a report in Deadline Hollywood, Pompeo was earning $300,000 per episode under the new deal. On January 17, 2018, it was announced by ABC that Ellen Pompeo's contract had been renewed through season 16. Not only does the contract renewal secure Pompeo's return as Meredith Grey, but it also makes her a producer of Grey's Anatomy and a co-executive producer of the spin-off series. The deal will make Pompeo the highest-paid actress currently on a dramatic TV series, with her making $575,000 per episode and over $20 million yearly. On May 10, 2019, Pompeo extended her contract through the seventeenth season after ABC renewed the show for seasons 16 and 17. = Characterization = Grey is the protagonist and focal point of the series. She has been called \\"intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, oftentimes outspoken, easily distracted, and indecisive\\" by Grey's Anatomy executives. Pompeo says she is unaware if her character knows how to have fun, adding: \\"All of my scenes with [Dempsey] are the same‚Äîwe're either breaking up or having sex.\\" Her personality has evolved over the past few seasons from depressed, to happy and \\"fixed\\". Pompeo said to Good Morning America, \\"I am so incredibly lucky to have Patrick [Dempsey], to have the chemistry that we do, we have an amazing relationship, and it's like any other relationship, you have your ups and downs. But we work it out, and we've found a way to do this for this long and still get along, and make it work and believe in what we're doing.\\" Pompeo told Entertainment Weekly: \\"It's awkward with Patrick [Dempsey] because he's like my brother. As soon as the camera is off, I'm like, 'Is your hand on my butt?' But there are millions of girls who have been waiting for this, so I feel an obligation to the fans.\\" Rhimes used the dog \\"Doc\\", which Meredith and Derek shared, as a metaphor for their relationship during the second season. She characterizes Grey as doing what she thinks is right: McKee deemed Grey and O'Malley's sexual encounter irreversible. The character had a one-night stand with George O'Malley, in the second season. Series writer Stacy McKee, said of the sexual encounter: \\"There's no turning back. There's nothing George and Meredith can do. The damage is done ‚Äì things will never be the same. They've just changed something important in their lives FOREVER and...they are freaking out.\\" Grey's character development has also been known as an influence on the creation of her half-sister, Lexie Grey. Particularly, it has been made clear that they both share the same motives. McKee offered her thoughts: \\"Meredith and Lexie both want to succeed. They want to be strong. They want to feel normal. They want, so much, to be whole. But it's a struggle ‚Äì a genuine struggle for them. Being hardcore doesn't come naturally. Sometimes, they have to fake it.\\" Grey's personality has been compared with that of Alex Karev's. Rhimes offered the insight: Pompeo fights for a truthful storyline for her character‚Äîshe wants it to be realistic and says you can't always wrap it up in a neat little package. Referring to Grey's tampering with Shepherd's trial, Pompeo said: \\"Listen, what Meredith did clearly crossed a line. Derek has a right to be pissed.\\" Following the tampering, Rhimes said she believes that Grey and Shepherd are meant to be together and that it in the end, they will end up with each other. Grey's relationship with Cristina Yang, has been looked upon as \\"sisterhood\\", and Yang has repeatedly referred to Grey as \\"her person\\". This led to the two being dubbed \\"the twisted sisters\\". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a \\"honeymoon\\" together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale. Grey has been characterized, by some, as \\"whiny\\". Rhimes offered her insight: Rhimes felt that the 100th episode showed well Meredith's evolution throughout the show from a \\"dark and twisty girl\\" to a \\"happy woman\\". She said: \\"She is the thing her mother wished for her. She is extraordinary. Because, to get past the crap of your past? To move on? To let the past go and change? That is extraordinary. To love? Without fear? Without screwing it up? That is extraordinary. It makes me happy to see her happy.\\" Following the departure of Patrick Dempsey's character, Rhimes was quoted as saying that \\"... Meredith and the entire Grey's Anatomy family are about to enter uncharted territory as we head into this new chapter of her life. The possibilities for what may come are endless.\\" With at least a year left in Pompeo's contract with the show, viewers are sure to witness some of the most difficult times of Meredith's life yet. Reception =Reviews= The character has received both overwhelmingly positive reviews and weary response from television critics throughout the course of the show. The initial response to the character was positive, but as the series progressed Meredith Grey became immensely popular and Pompeo established the character as a critic and fan favorite featuring on a number of Top TV Character lists. The development of the character has been deemed as the highlight of the show. Grey has constantly been defined as \\"the heroine of Grey's Anatomy\\". At the time of inception Newsday's Diane Werts praised the character stating: \\"Like Hugh Laurie's irascible \\"House\\" title character, star Ellen Pompeo's newly minted Dr. Grey conveys such substance that you simply can't stop watching.\\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/greys- anatomy/critic-reviews Ellen A. Kim of After Pompeo not receiving an Emmy nomination for her work as Grey, McNamara of the Los Angeles Times suggested that Pompeo, \\"who has worked very hard and against all narrative odds to make Meredith Grey an interesting character at last\\" should have received a nomination at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Later, during the twelfth season, Western Gazette gave Ellen Pompeo the credit for carrying the show and re-iterated it's \\"time for Pompeo to finally win an Emmy Award.\\" Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly referred to Grey as the \\"trusty voice-over master\\" of Grey's Anatomy. Pompeo's connection with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd) is acclaimed as a high point of the series. Former television columnist for The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season's finale: \\"On those occasions when Meredith's not involved in a plot about her love life, I do kind of like her, but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really, really can't stand her.\\" During the show's third season, the development of the character received negative reviews, with Cristopher Monfette of IGN stating that her storyline has become \\"some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do.\\" Also during the third season, Robert Rorke of the New York Post noted the decline in Meredith's role in the show, expressing disappointment: \\"She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies.\\" Similarly, Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused, \\"This whole 'Oh I need more time,' but 'Oh, I'm jealous if you look at someone else' angst was tired in the second season, frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer. The will-they-or-won't-they plot doesn't work because they've already been in and out of that relationship too many times. Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked.\\" On a more positive note, her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV's list of the \\"Best TV Couples of All Time\\" and in the same list by TV Guide. During the sixth season the development of the character was praised, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that \\"You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy.\\", in addition to praising Pompeo's performance. In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote \\"I felt for Meredith, but after Lexie's heartfelt begging and pleading, I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside. Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first, and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver‚Äîher offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone.\\"http://www.buddytv.com/articles/greys-anatomy/greys-anatomy- episode-64-taint-31787.aspx Reviewing the first part of the eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: \\"this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season.\\" Wit & Fancy praised the transformation of the character and stated, \\"Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola or tampered with the trial, but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty. Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now, I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up, she finally became 'all whole and healed'.\\"http://witandfancy.com/2012/01/22/awesome-female- characters-meredith-grey-and-her-journey-from-dark-and-twisty-to-whole-and- healed/ Maura O'Malley of Bustle also lauded the development of the character ahead of season 12 saying, \\"When the series began, Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life. She had graduated medical school, she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital, and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached, one night stand. What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet ‚Äî but the key is, she wasn't searching for love. Working and learning were ‚Äî and continue to be ‚Äî her priorities, while McDreamy was simply an added perk. Hopefully, the new season of Grey's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone, because Meredith is a strong, independent woman ‚Äî and she will be just fine.\\" Later in the series, Ellen Pompeo received critical acclaim with numerous critics lauding her portrayal of the character. Reviewing the episode She's Leaving Home CarterMatt called her the \\"anchor\\" for Grey's saying, \\"Throughout, this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo, who has done some of her best work ever on the show the past couple of weeks. Tonight, she cried, she fought, and she learned that she was carrying his child.\\" and added that Pompeo is often \\"overlooked\\" saying, \\"Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked.\\" Rick Porter of Zap2it reviewing \\"How to Save a Life\\" wrote, \\"Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, \\"How to Save a Life\\" would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. \\"How to Save a Life\\" may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show.\\"http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/greys_anatomy_ellen_pompeo_saved_how_to_save_a_life-2015-04 USA Today also lauded Pompeo saying, \\" In some ways, the episode (How to Save a Life) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo. She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes, from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life.\\" Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered Meredith's friendship with Cristina (Sandra Oh) to be \\"the secret core of Grey's\\". The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show. Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be \\"the secret core of Grey's\\". Aisha Harris of Slate called their relation The Best Female Friendship on TV adding that \\"With those two characters, showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television.\\" Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because \\"they don't try to be\\". There's nothing fake about them, which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television. She further went on to call them 'soulmates', \\" And even though they'd never dare get sappy enough to say it, they're soul mates. Margaret Lyons of Vulture (magazine) called the friendship \\" dream BFF relationship.\\" and the primary focus of the show, \\"One of the series' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships.\\"https://www.vulture.com/2013/12/meredith-cristina-greys- anatomy-fight.html E! at the time of Sandra Oh's exit wrote, \\"In Grey's Anatomys 10-year history, the doctor duo has been through a lot together: weddings, deaths, plane crashes, bomb threats, shooting, you name it, they've lived (and danced) through it. \\" and added, \\"And with the three words, 'You're my person.Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen's best best friends ever.\\" Marama Whyte of Hypable wrote, \\"Critically, the key relationship in Meredith's life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd, but her passionate, indestructible, absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina. Talk about relationship goals; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person. These two were the real powerhouse, and Shonda Rhimes didn't shy away from making the audience remember this. Derek was the love of her life, but Cristina was her soul mate. More than anyone else, Cristina challenged Meredith, was honest with her and inspired her. For these reasons, it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith's character development, not Derek.\\" Pompeo's character has also been used to define the image a strong woman, Bustle previewing the 12th season wrote, \\"Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own. Grey's Anatomy is about Meredith's journey. Men and romantic interests are a part of her life, but they are not the priority. She doesn't need McDreamy. Grey's Anatomy doesn't need McDreamy. So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey (Martin Henderson, perhaps?), it wouldn't matter. I have faith that the show's writers will do this storyline justice, because TV needs more strong single women ‚Äî and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate.\\" The site added, \\"This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey's Anatomy. When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research, Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career. She didn't chase him. Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man, and I believe that this won't change after Derek's death.\\" =Awards= Pompeo's failure to garner an Emmy Award nomination has been called a \\"snub\\" on multiple occasions. Pompeo has won and has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of Grey. She and the Grey's Anatomy cast won Best Ensemble in a Television Series at the 2006 Satellite Awards. During the following year's ceremony, she was named Best Actress in a Television Drama Series. She was among the Grey's Anatomy cast members awarded the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series accolade at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and received nominations in the same category in 2006 and 2008. Pompeo received a Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series nomination at the 64th Golden Globe Awards ‚Äì the program won Best Drama Series at the same ceremony. Also in 2007, Pompeo and the female cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy received the Women in Film Lucy Award, which honors those \\"whose work in television has positively influenced attitudes toward women.\\" Pompeo's performance has garnered her multiple People's Choice Awards. At the 37th People's Choice Awards, she was nominated against Dempsey and Oh in the Favorite TV Doctor category, and the following year, she was a contender in the Favorite TV Drama Actress category. Since 2012, Pompeo has received a nomination at the People's Choice Awards every year in two categories at 40th People's Choice Awards alongside Patrick Dempsey and Sandra Oh respectively. She won the Best Drama Actress Award at both the 39th People's Choice Awardshttp://www.wetpaint.com/greys-anatomy/articles/ellen-pompeo-and-greys- anatomy-win-big-at-2013-peoples-choice-awards?rand=130121 and the 41st People's Choice Awards. In 2007, show-business awards reporter Tom O'Neil commented that Pompeo was overdue an Emmy Award nomination for her role in Grey's Anatomy. Readers of O'Neil's awards website, The Envelope, included Pompeo in their 2009 nominations for Best Drama Actress in the site's Gold Derby TV Awards. Entertainment Weekly launched the EWwy Awards in 2008, to honor actors who have not received Emmy nominations. Pompeo was nominated in the Best Actress in a Drama Series category, and placed fourth, with 19 percent of readers' votes.

The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by actress Sandra Oh. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to resident level, eventually becoming a cardiothoracic surgical fellow, while her relationships with colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) formed a focal point of the series. Earlier in the series, Yang got engaged to Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), in the past had a relationship with renowned surgeon and mentor Colin Marlowe (Roger Rees), and wed but later divorced Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Oh originally auditioned for the role of Miranda Bailey, although Chandra Wilson was ultimately cast in the part. Oh has received highly positive reviews for her portrayal, with Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considering her friendship with Meredith to be \\"the secret-core of Grey's\\". Oh has also garnered numerous awards and nominations for her role as Yang, including Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award wins in 2006. She was additionally nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series each year, from 2005 to 2009. Characterizing the character, ABC noted her competitiveness, ambition, and intelligence as her main traits, while her aggressive and tactless attitude was highlighted as her main weakness. In May 2012, E! Online reported that Oh had signed on for two more years, along with her fellow cast members. Oh left the show after season 10, and her character Cristina Yang was written out of the storyline as a main cast member.  Storylines and character  Cristina Yang is introduced as a graduate from Smith College and a fellow surgical intern to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T.R. Knight); the five of them working under Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). An atheistic competitive intern of Korean-American ancestry, she first desired to become a doctor after a childhood car accident which killed her biological father. Yang also had dyslexia, and was raised in Beverly Hills, California by her mother and supportive Jewish stepfather. She has a B.A. from Smith College, an MD from Stanford University and a Ph.D. from University of California, Berkeley, making her a \\"double doctor\\". While her emotional pragmatism, competitive perfectionism, and logical nature lead many to view her as a cutthroat \\"robot\\", Cristina hits it off with Meredith on their first day and the pair soon become best-friends and each other's \\"person\\", sharing the same \\"dark and twisty\\" view of life and sense of humor. During her internship, Cristina has an on-off relationship with the chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) that leads to an accidental pregnancy. Yang schedules an abortion without telling him about the pregnancy due to Burke's behavior towards their lack of relationship status. However, Yang experiences an ectopic pregnancy and Burke discovers the pregnancy after Yang collapses from a burst fallopian tube while in the O.R. Burke and Yang resume their relationship in the aftermath of her miscarriage. Burke gets shot after a ‚Äúshooting‚Äù at the hospital and needs surgery. After Burke is shot in the arm and develops a hand tremor, Yang helps him cover it up by forming a covert partnership wherein she performs most of his surgeries. Yang initially denies involvement during a confrontation, but then confesses everything to Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), the chief of surgery. Yang's actions jeopardize Burke's chances of becoming chief, which he views as a huge betrayal. After a short breakup, Yang breaks the silence and Burke proposes marriage, which Yang accepts after eight days of hesitation. When the wedding day comes, Yang has a moment of panic before she is about to walk down the aisle but Burke leaves her because he wasn‚Äôt sure if she was ready to commit. Burke then disappears and isn‚Äôt seen again until later in the series. Yang then proceeds to go on her honeymoon to Hawaii with Meredith to recover, returning to discover that Burke has disappeared from her life and transferred to a different hospital. Burke is replaced by Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, going so far as refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of cardiac surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of cardio (due to a disagreement with Torres). Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals and Burke wins the Harper-Avery award without mentioning her at all, despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is \\"unbearable\\" and that she has turned into a ghost. Yang meets Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), an army trauma surgeon when he patches her up from being stabbed in the stomach by a falling icicle outside the hospital. The pair are immediately attracted to each other and share a brief kiss. Owen Hunt is later honorably discharged, he is hired as Seattle Grace's chief of trauma surgery and he and Yang begin a flirtation. Yang grows emotionally when she decides to support Meredith in her relationship with Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), despite her logical misgivings about their staying power, and begins to be more emotionally open towards Hunt. However, Hunt has repressed memories of his time in Iraq and PTSD which causes Hunt to behave erratically, and even attack and strangle her while asleep. Yang attempts to be emotionally supportive but ends their relationship as she is afraid of sleeping next to him. Cristina loses her shot at being the first resident to perform a solo surgery despite being unanimously chosen by the attending surgeons, having been disciplined from failing to report the irresponsible behavior of the new interns. Meredith and Cristina have a fight during the intern scandal, and Cristina chooses Alex to be her replacement. They eventually reconcile. When Izzie discovers her life-threatening cancer, Yang is the one she confides in over her other friends due to Yang's ability to remain emotionally distant. Yang saves Izzie's life by coming up with a treatment plan and forcing Izzie to tell their friends of her diagnosis. Hunt begins seeing a therapist, and Yang confesses her love for him. The pair begin a tentative relationship, hampered by Hunt's therapeutic progress and his hot and cold professional behavior, wherein he frequently ignores or penalizes Yang to avoid the appearance of favoritism. Hunt hires ex-colleague from the Army, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), to become the chief of cardiothoracic surgery as a \\"gift\\" for Yang, after she breaks down over having no new head of cardio. Yang is unimpressed with Altman, neither published nor famous, but her calm proficiency and belief in Yang's skills win her over. A conflict arises in the trio due to Altman and Hunt's repressed feelings for each other. Altman chooses to resign her place as temporary head of cardio because of her feelings for Hunt. Devastated by the blow to her education and the depressing potential of returning to her previous directionless state, Yang begs Altman to stay and teach her, offering Hunt to Altman in exchange. Altman intellectually understands Yang choosing her gift over a man and their relationship is repaired, but Hunt is deeply hurt that Yang traded him away. Hunt subconsciously tries to sabotage Yang's education and the two break up again after Hunt is unable to decide between the two women. After Derek was shot by Gary Clark, a grieving widower who commits mass murder at the hospital, Cristina operates on Derek at gunpoint, thus saving his life. The shooter injures Hunt as well when he chooses to return for Yang over Altman and Grey treats him as Yang saves Grey's husband. Following the attack on the hospital, Yang and Hunt impulsively decide to get married. Yang suffers from severe PTSD and is unable to bear being alone making marriage to Hunt, who understands what she's going through, attractive. Yang spends the early days of her marriage in shock and hiding at Meredith's. Due to having severe PTSD and being unable to do her job correctly anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally and she ultimately decides to go to work after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton (Scott Foley), Altman's husband, not knowing his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt-stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang to come up with a wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on. Yang and Hunt distance themselves from each other as they keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counseling. Hunt has a one-night stand with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their medical boards and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are involved in an aviation accident while on the way to Boise, Idaho to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, has brief reactive psychosis which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow and goes, as planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas (William Daniels). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker (Steven Culp) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle. Cristina is re-hired and Owen asks for a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the potential conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as he thought she was dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near- bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital with the help of the Harper- Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't. After breaking up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points out the fact that it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgment. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina kisses him, and later begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful, and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family. Cristina is nominated for the Harper Avery award and is a strong candidate, however she is passed over due to her relationship with the Harper-Avery Foundation, that co- owns Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital. Cristina goes to speak at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, orchestrated by Preston Burke who built his own hospital following his winning of the Harper Avery. He offers Cristina his job as the head of the hospital so that he can spend more time with his wife and kids. Cristina accepts the offer and interviews candidates for her replacement position at the hospital, including Maggie Pierce for the new chief of cardio. Cristina transfers her hospital shares to Alex Karev and recommends he take over her seat on the board. At the end of season 10, she says goodbye to her co-workers she has come to know and love including Owen, Derek and Meredith. Cristina and Meredith share special moments reminiscing about all the horrors they went through and dancing it out one last time. Cristina leaves for Zurich with surgical intern Shane Ross, who chooses to leave in order to study under her in Switzerland. Development =Casting & Creation= Sandra Oh's character was not supposed to be of Asian descent. On the creation of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained \\"a little bit of [her] personality\\". Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: \\"Cristina was second, simply because she's the kind of woman I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with.\\" Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: \\"Thank God I did not get that part\\", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: \\"She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say.\\" The character of Yang was not originally supposed to be of Asian descent. Oh said her character was \\"a pert little blonde and the thing is the woman who runs the show, Shonda Rhimes, is a black woman, which makes a big fucking difference.\\" In 2009, when asked why Oh signed on for Grey's Anatomy, Oh said: : \\"I'm very proud of this show and I think it came along at the right time for me. It's a changing time on television because 5 or 10 years ago you wouldn't have a major network show where half of the cast were not white.\\" Oh's original contract with the show expired after season 8, however, E! Online reported in May 2012, that Oh, as well as all original cast members, had signed on for 2 more years. =Characterization= The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) characterized Yang as \\"competitive\\", \\"ambitious\\", and \\"intelligent\\", while also noting her weaknesses: \\"bossy\\", \\"aggressive\\", and \\"tactless\\". Oh said of her character: \\"I've always tried to play Cristina with a tremendous amount of focus and ambition‚Äîwhich is the reality for a female surgeon. I mean, in real life there aren't many of them. But the ones you encounter are at the very top of their game. You have to have a kind of ascetic personality to survive.\\" James Pickens Jr. who portrays Dr. Webber said: \\"That character itself set a bar in terms of how we look at millennial women: independent yet vulnerable, seriously competitive yet caring.\\" Rhimes referred to Yang's relationship with Burke by the portmanteau \\"Burktina\\", citing \\"Losing My Religion\\" as one of her favorite episodes featuring them because it shows their evolution from the beginning of the second season to its end. Kevin McKidd's character was introduced as a love-interest for Yang. Rhimes commented, \\"[We see] her struggle to suppress all of her humanity in pursuit of perfection. And in my mind, what we realize is that she is not cold. She is terrified. Scared that if she lets her emotions out, they will overtake her and she will be hurt. And you can't hate her. Because it's so incredibly human and understandable.\\" Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as \\"sisterhood\\", and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as \\"her person\\". This led to the two being dubbed \\"the twisted sisters\\". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a \\"honeymoon\\" together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale. New York magazine wrote of the character: \\"There's probably no woman on TV right now more single-mindedly dedicated to her career than Cristina. It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established that she would have an abortion in this circumstance.\\" Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because \\"that was so much more interesting, story-wise\\". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: \\"I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [it] would have been hideous. [The abortion] made sense for the character.\\" Discussing his onscreen relationship with Yang, McKidd said: \\"It's not going to be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet.\\" On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: \\"It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting.\\" Oh said of Yang's expressions of emotions during season eight: \\"You see her express her emotions with only two people: her best-friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart and then you have to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season.\\" Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: \\"I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon.\\" Reception =Reviews= Isaiah Washington's character's relationship with Yang was highly acclaimed. The character received positive reviews from critics at the time of its inception and as the series went on the reviews turned to high acclaim and Yang went on the become an iconic character not just for Grey's, but for television itself. Kelli Catana of The Huffington Post named Yang \\"the best damn character\\" of the series. Yang appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters, with the website commenting that she is \\"an engaging yet comedic factor for the prime-time soap Grey's Anatomy.\\" Philadelphia Magazine included Yang in its list of the \\"10 Best Doctors on Television\\". However, the same periodical listed her as one of \\"The 12 Most Annoying Women on TV\\". Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considers her friendship with Meredith to be \\"the secret core of Grey's and perhaps creator Shonda Rhimes' greatest contribution to primetime.\\" The Huffington Post writer Kelli Catana agreed, saying: \\"the Meredith Grey/Cristina Yang relationship is probably the most true friendship on network television.\\" Their friendship was listed in AOL TV's \\"Top 20: TV's Best BFFs\\" and in Entertainment Weekly \\"30 Best TV Bromances/Gal Pals\\". Yahoo! Voices also put Yang on their list of \\"The Most Loyal TV best-friends of All Time\\". Television Without Pity writer Lauren Shotwell claimed Yang is \\"the only one of these five [residents] that regularly acts like an actual doctor\\". Yang's relationship with Burke was highly acclaimed; it was considered as \\"one of the most interesting relationships on the show\\". Similarly, The Orange County Register wrote that their romance became \\"one of the most touching and funny attractions of Grey's Anatomy.\\" Christopher Monfette of IGN was critical of their wedding planning in the third season, saying: \\"The will-they's and won't-they's fly and fall like hobbled pigeons until the season finale when the show solves both its personal and professional problems in the most obvious and least compelling of ways.\\" UGO.com placed their break-up on its list of The Most Horrible TV Breakups. In 2009, Monfette said of Yang's relationship with Owen: \\"[Hunt's] interactions with Cristina were perfectly balanced for optimum drama, never together and never apart for so long that the back-and-forth became frustrating. Viewers could clearly see a softening of the typically hard-edged Cristina, a pleasant change for what had become something of a one-note character.\\" Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly also praised the pairing, especially in \\"Elevator Love Letter\\", saying: \\"As good as they've been at amping up the romance crackling between Cristina and Owen, Sandra Oh and Kevin McKidd brought the Emmy consideration tonight from scene 1.\\" She also added: \\"I loved seeing Cristina at least try to stand by her man.\\" Of Yang and Hunt's wedding, Armstrong said: \\"Glad we made a clean disposal of the Cristina-Owen-Teddy love-triangle, though, when he quipped to Teddy, \\"I heard there's a guy,\\" and she said she was happy for him.\\" She also praised Owen's proposal scene, giving it an \\"A\\". Later, she praised their marriage, saying: \\"I am absolutely loving the stronger-than-ever lady-bond between these two this season. Is it because they're both married now? Just growing up? Whatever, it's the opposite of Blair and Serena's annoyingly fickle frenemy status on Gossip Girl, and I can't get enough.\\" 'New York Magazine praised the abortion storyline, saying that the show \\"was brave enough to do what almost no other series will: show this one particular, totally legal medical procedure on TV\\" and that the abortion was \\"the only plausible resolution\\" for Yang's pregnancy. Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, said of Yang's actions after Owen's affair: \\"It alternately seems silly and not silly, when you really think about it.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Yang's storylines in the eighth season, saying: \\"Their stories are effectively tied into that of a patient whose ability to move forward is complicated by a complex response to a hideous past.\\" HitFix writer Liane Bonin Starr applauded Yang's brief departure from Seattle Grace to Mayo Clinic in the ninth season, which was \\"interesting\\" as \\"it showed us a new side of her‚Äîand after so many seasons, that was some welcome insight.\\" The relationship between Meredith and Cristina has been highly acclaimed and been a highlight of the show. Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be \\"the secret-core of Grey's\\". Aisha Harris of Slate called their relation The Best Female Friendship on TV adding that \\"With those two characters, showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television.\\" Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly called Meredith and Cristina the best female friends on TV because \\"they don't try to be\\". There's nothing fake about them, which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television. She further went on to call them 'soulmate', \\"And even though they'd never dare get sappy enough to say it, they're soulmates. Margaret Lyons of Vulture (magazine) called the friendship \\"dream-BFF-relationship.\\" and the primary focus of the show, \\"One of the series' calling-cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships.\\" E! at the time of Sandra Oh's exit wrote, \\"In Grey's Anatomys 10-year history, the doctor-duo has been through a lot together: weddings, deaths, drownings, plane-crashes, bomb-threats, shootings, you name it, they've lived (and danced) through it.\\" and added, \\"And with the 3 words, \\"You're My Person\\", Meredith Grey and Cristina Yang solidified their status as the small screen's best best-friends ever.\\" =Awards= Oh received 5 straight nominations for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the Primetime Emmy Awards from 2005‚Äì09. Oh has received numerous awards and nominations for her portrayal of Yang. In 2005, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, which she was nominated for every year until 2009. Also in 2005, she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 10th Satellite Awards.

The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and was portrayed by actress Katherine Heigl from 2005 to 2010. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Izzie worked her way up to resident level, while her relationships with her colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) formed a focal point of the series. Heigl garnered high critical acclaim for her performance as Izzie and received numerous awards and nominations for her role, winning the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2007. She was critical of the character's development during the show's fourth season, particularly her romance with her on-screen best- friend George. She declined to pursue a nomination for the 2008 Emmy Awards, citing insufficient material in the role. After speculation that Izzie would be killed off in the fifth season, the character was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic melanoma. She married Alex in the series' 100th episode, and afterwards, her tumor was successfully removed. Izzie made her final appearance in the sixth season, leaving Seattle after Alex refused to resume their marriage. Heigl requested to be released from her contract 18 months early, in order to spend more time with her family. 10 years after her final appearance, the character's fate was revealed in a season 16 episode. Storylines Izzie appears in the first episode of Grey's Anatomy, meeting fellow interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley. She and George move in with Meredith and become best-friends. Izzie's boyfriend, hockey player Hank (Jonathan Scarfe), struggles to accept her new role as a surgeon, and the two break up. Izzie is hurt when Alex exposes her past as a lingerie model. However, the two later go on to begin a friendship, and then a romance. Alex experiences sexual dysfunction with Izzie and cheats on her with nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback). When Izzie finds out, she breaks up with him, though they briefly reunite following a bomb incident at the hospital. Izzie falls in love with cardiothoracic patient Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the two become engaged. When Denny's condition deteriorates, Izzie deliberately worsens his health further by cutting his LVAD wire to move him up the UNOS ddonor register. Although Denny receives a new heart, he has a stroke hours later and dies. Izzie is the sole beneficiary of Denny's will, inheriting $8.7 million. She uses the money to open a free clinic at the hospital: the Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic. Izzie disapproves of George's relationship with and marriage to orthopedic resident Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). She and George sleep together, and attempt to keep their liaison a secret. George and resident Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) are the only people aware that Izzie gave birth to a daughter at the age of 16; ultimately the child was given up for adoption. He supports Izzie when her daughter Hannah (Liv Hutchings), diagnosed with leukemia, arrives at Seattle Grace Hospital in need of a bone marrow transplant from Izzie. Izzie's feelings for George grow, and she reveals that she has fallen in love with him. When Callie discovers George has been unfaithful, the two separate, and George and Izzie embark on a short-lived relationship, only to discover there is no real chemistry between them, and they decide to end their relationship and remain friends. Izzie supports Alex when he discovers his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces him to have her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities. Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny. She discovers she has Stage 4 metastatic melanoma which has spread to her liver, skin and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%. She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain. Izzie spends her time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry in front of all their friends. The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later. The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining. Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work. Izzie makes a treatment error that endangers the life of a patient, and is fired from the hospital's surgical program. Believing Alex is partially to blame, she writes him a Dear John letter and leaves. Izzie later learns that Alex was not responsible for her lost job, and returns to make amends with him, but Meredith informs her that Alex is moving on. Izzie informs Alex that she no longer has cancer. Although he is pleased, Alex officially breaks up with Izzie, telling her that he loves her but deserves better. She leaves Seattle to start fresh. Several episodes later, Alex informs Meredith that Izzie sent divorce papers, which he signs in the season 6 episode \\"How Insensitive\\". In the sixth-season finale, Alex is shot and asks for Izzie. Imagining that Meredith's half-sister Lexie (Chyler Leigh) is Izzie, he apologizes and asks her never to leave him again. In the season 12 episode \\"I Choose You\\", Alex's new partner Jo (Camilla Luddington) finds an invoice from the fertility clinic that housed Izzie and Alex's fertilized embryos from when she had cancer, and ponders the possibility that he has \\"a bunch of Izzie babies\\". In the 300th episode, Alex reveals he never found out what happened to Izzie, but envisions a perfect life for her, always smiling, now that he has moved on and is happy with Jo. While the character was not fully seen in the season 16 episode \\"Leave a Light On\\", it was revealed that Alex left Jo and got back together with Izzie, who is now working as a surgical oncologist. The two of them are revealed to be living on a farm in Kansas raising 5-year- old twins named Alexis and Eli. Development =Casting & Creation= Heigl refused to be considered for the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2008 due to insufficient material on Grey's Anatomy. Izzie was created by Grey's Anatomy producer Shonda Rhimes, with actress Katherine Heigl cast in the role. Heigl originally wanted to play Izzie as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blond for the part. Heigl's comprehension of medical procedures and terminology is slight; the actress explained that while she has an admiration for doctors, she is not as fascinated by medicine as other cast members. When Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery left Grey's Anatomy to launch the spin-off show Private Practice, Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin- off for Izzie. Heigl declined to put her name forward for consideration at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2008, claiming that she had been given insufficient material on the series to warrant a nomination. Following Heigl's statement, speculation arose that her character would suffer a brain tumor and be killed off Grey's Anatomy, substantiated by the announcement Jeffrey Dean Morgan would return to the series as Denny, who died at the end of season 2. ABC's entertainment president Steve McPherson denied the rumor, stating: \\"There is an unbelievable storyline for her this year, which is really central to everything that's going to go on this season\\". Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan returned to the show for a second time in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T. R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic melanoma which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's 100th episode wrap-up party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final 5 episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18 months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted to spend more time with her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, \\"[Katherine] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. \\"Even though there's a part of me that would like to go back and do the quick Izzie farewell, \\" she says, \\"I also think that my last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Please don't go, This is your home,' and Izzie's response was, 'No it‚Äôs not, not anymore it‚Äôs just a place I worked and I can do that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene, I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on.\\" In August 2010, Rhimes stated that she did not feel Izzie's character arc‚Äîspecifically her relationship with Alex‚Äîhad fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the seventh season. She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure. Instead, she concluded: \\"I'm open to seeing Izzie again. So if she [Katherine] were to come back, we would be thrilled to [wrap up her story]. But if she doesn't, we'll just move on.\\" Heigl also went on to say in October 2010 that the character's returning to show looks bleak because, \\"that chapter is closed, and it's sad. And it's hard.\\" She also felt that Izzie coming back to the show would, \\"just feel manipulative.\\"Katherine Heigl On 'Grey's Anatomy': 'That Chapter Is Closed' However, in January 2012, Heigl stated in an interview that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: \\"I've told them I want to [return],\\" she said. \\"I really, really, really want to see where [Izzie] is. I just want to know what happened to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back.\\" She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, \\"Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day... you grow up together, in a way,\\" and again commented on Izzie's possibly returning to the show, \\"I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work... They've got a lot of story lines going on there.\\"Katherine Heigl Regrets Leaving 'Grey's Anatomy' (VIDEO) But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, \\"I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now.\\" 3 years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, \\"I‚Äôm done with that story. I‚Äôve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don‚Äôt think so.\\"Grey's Anatomy Boss Shonda Rhimes Crushes My Katherine Heigl Comeback Dream: 'I'm Done With That Story' TV Line, Retrieved August 6, 2015 =Characterization= Heigl believes that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a \\"super-moral\\" version of herself. The episode \\"Bring the Pain\\", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended to be the final episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came \\"full-circle\\" from her role in the pilot: \\"Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from her sleeve in 'Bring the Pain'.\\" Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is \\"immensely kind and patient\\". When Denny died in the season season finale \\"Losing My Religion\\", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that \\"At the beginning of the [third] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people.\\" In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: \\"I love that Izzie and Mer respond with all the trauma of having viewed a car-crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her a tiny bit about the hand-washing and that made me overjoyed because that‚Äôs the kind of thing people do.\\" Discussing Izzie's relationship with Alex in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that \\"Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her [Izzie], she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over. [...] To go for a guy like that is to say I want to be damaged.'\\" Writer Stacy McKee deemed Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette \\"karma\\", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with \\"the undeniably-handsome-and-totally-charming\\" Denny. Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: \\"I love the way Izzie lights up when she's around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free.\\" Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie \\"seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny.\\" When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: \\"is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the LVAD wire for love, so does that make her action understandable?\\" Heigl was critical of Izzie's relationship with George (T. R. Knight), deeming it \\"a ratings-ploy\\". Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: \\"Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed sombrely. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn‚Äôt know this was coming.\\" Following Denny's death, Heigl approached Rhimes to ask when her character would next have a romantic liaison. Rhimes explained that \\"Izzie doesn't sleep around\\". Heigl expressed a desire for Izzie to reunite with Alex, explaining: \\"I believe on some level, there's a connection between Izzie and Alex. He can do honorable things even though he's cutting and sarcastic. I would like to ultimately see them together, if not this season, then next.\\" Yahoo! Voices wrote that Stevens in the third season \\"has become more condescending and passive-aggressive herself, more than anyone else.\\" Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed \\"a ratings-ploy\\". Heigl explained: \\"They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot.\\" Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: > People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend to be the first to slip > and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of > what she's done, because what‚Äôs interesting is when people make decisions > that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was > capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability. Reception Heigl was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress in a TV Series award at the 2007 and 2008 Golden Globe Awards for her role as Izzie Stevens. She was named \\"Favorite Female TV Star\\" at the 34th People's Choice Awards, and awarded the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the 2007 Emmy Awards, becoming the only star-billed cast member of the show to have received a Primetime Emmy Award. Prior to the ceremony, considering Heigl's chances of winning the Emmy, Variety's Stuart Levine assessed of her performance: \\"Heigl has little difficulty reaching Izzie's highest highs and lowest lows. Showrunner Shonda Rhimes puts a lot of pressure on Heigl to carry many intense storylines, and she's up to the challenge.\\" Levine also noted, however: \\"There are times when Izzie becomes completely irrational during crisis situations, which may bother some.\\" Fox News included Izzie in its list of \\"The Best TV Doctors For Surgeon General\\". The character was listed in Wetpaints \\"10 Hottest Female Doctors on TV\\" and in BuzzFeeds \\"16 Hottest Doctors On Television\\". Heigl at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards where she won the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. During the show's third season, the New York Post Robert Rorke deemed Izzie to be \\"the heart-and-soul\\" of Grey's Anatomy. He deemed her the show's heroine, and wrote that: \\"Izzie is a welcome, calming presence, despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fianc√© Denny Duquette. [...] Besides the formidable Dr. Bailey played by Chandra Wilson, Izzie seems to be the only adult intern at Seattle Grace; the character has achieved a depth lacking in her fellow interns.\\" Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle was critical of Izzie's ethics in cutting Denny's LVAD wire, writing that she \\"should not be practising medicine\\" and stating: \\"That's the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy, anymore, because the super-hot blond chick can make an earth- shattering, fatal decision and she doesn't get canned.\\" The season 4 romance between Izzie and George proved to be highly unpopular with viewers, and resulted in a fan backlash among Izzie and Alex fans. The return of Izzie's deceased fianc√© Denny and the resumption of their romance during the show's fifth season also proved unpopular with fans, and was deemed \\"the world's worst storyline\\" by Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times. McNamara was also critical of the fifth season finale episode \\"Now or Never\\", which saw Izzie flatline following neurosurgery, opining that Izzie ought to die. The episode in which Izzie married long-term love Alex received 15.3 million viewers, the largest television audience of the night. In season 16, Alex explains in a series of lengthy letters to Meredith, Jo, and Bailey (recited via voiceover by Justin Chambers, who did not actually appear in the episode), that he had recently reconnected with Izzie and learned that she, after leaving Seattle, had secretly given birth to their twins, Alexis and Eli. Izzie's cancer storyline received a mixed response from the medical community. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, commented that Izzie's treatment options were unrealistic. Whereas in the show she was offered the drug interleukin-2, in reality the drug is never recommended to patients when melanoma has spread to the brain, as it can cause bleeding and strokes. Brawley explained that such patients would instead be offered radiosurgery. Conversely however, Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, praised Grey's Anatomy for bringing about greater public awareness of melanoma, stating: \\"We welcome the national spotlight Grey's Anatomy has created for melanoma and its efforts to encourage viewers to learn more about the importance of prevention, early detection and research.\\"  References  Specific General *  External links  Category:Grey's Anatomy characters Category:Fictional models Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Fictional characters from Seattle Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional characters with cancer Category:Fictional female doctors Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Izzie Stevens"},{"id":"7687023","text":"Alexander Michael Karev, M.D. is a fictional character on the ABC television series Grey's Anatomy, portrayed by actor Justin Chambers. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Karev eventually obtained the position of resident, later becoming a pediatric surgical fellow. The relationships among colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) formed a focal point of the series. The character is initially disliked by his fellow interns, and is often accused of being brusque and dismissive with his patients and co-workers. As a resident, Karev's negative attitude, temper and rudeness occasionally earned the ire of the attendings. Former neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery requested him on her service as punishment for his rudeness to her and neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd, amongst others, throwing him out of their service for his inappropriate comments about patients. He then demonstrates profound skill for the specialty which prompts praise from Montgomery and contributes to Karev's interest in pediatric surgery for the rest of the series. As the character developed, he displayed more empathy for patients and was shown to have a gift for connecting with young children, despite his repeated claims to dislike them. In the fifteenth season premiere, Alex becomes interim Chief of Surgery after Miranda Bailey takes a sabbatical. In the sixteenth season, Alex leaves Seattle to be with Izzie Stevens and their children, making his final appearance in the season 16 episode \\"Leave a Light On.\\" Storylines Alex's mother had a mental illness, and his father was often absent, as well as often becoming violent towards him and his mother. Alex began wrestling in high school, and eventually physically confronted his father, after which, his father did not return. Alex has a younger brother, Aaron, and a younger sister, Amber; they were all placed in foster care for 5 years. Though Aaron and Amber only had a few foster families, Alex went through 17 foster families in 5 years before he reunited with his siblings. It is revealed in later seasons that Aaron was diagnosed with schizophrenia and tried to kill Amber. Alex was present when Aaron had to be committed to a psychiatric ward. Alex secured a position in the surgical residency program at Seattle Grace Hospital after graduating from the University of Iowa. He initially makes a poor impression meeting his fellow interns Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) and Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) whom he later taunts when he discovers she used to be a lingerie model. After initial disagreements, Alex reveals to Izzie that his father was a heroin addict who used to beat his mother. He became a wrestler so he could defend his mother, and attended university on a wrestling scholarship. He and Izzie begin a friendship. At the end of the first season, George contracts syphilis from Alex through nurse Olivia Harper, causing animosity between the two. Alex asks Izzie out on a date, but he is thrown by the news that he has failed his medical board exams. Izzie is offended since he pays no attention to her during their date and so informs him that she no longer wants to go out with him. He later freezes during an emergency operation, needing George to take over from him. Alex's relationship with Izzie is damaged when he experiences erectile dysfunction with her. He goes on to sleep with Olivia again, and is caught by Izzie and they break up. After retaking his exams, Alex manages a pass, and reunites with Izzie after a bomb scare in the hospital. They break up again, however, when Izzie falls for cardiothoracic patient Denny Duquette. Alex helps Izzie recover from Denny's death and advances Izzie but Izzie backs away since she is still in the process of getting over her loss and they remain friends. Alex spends a period of time working under neonatal surgeon Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), and though he is later released to work for plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), he finds his interest returning to Addison's firm. Addison is attracted to Alex, and the two share a kiss and later sleep together. In the aftermath of a ferry accident, Alex rescues a pregnant woman (Elizabeth Reaser) who awakes with amnesia, and grows close to Alex as he helps her forging an identity for herself, picking out the name Ava. After she gives birth to her daughter, Ava's memory eventually returns, although she tries to hide it from Alex as she had recently left a bad marriage. He convinces her to tell him her true identity, and she reveals herself to be Rebecca Pope. Alex turns her down after realizing she's married, feeling that he is not good enough for her. Rebecca returns and she and Alex sleep together before she goes back to her husband. Alex has a brief relationship with intern Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), but chooses to be with Rebecca when she returns and tells him she is pregnant. After Rebecca attempted suicide, Izzie convinces Alex to admit her for psychiatric help due to Rebecca's hallucinations of her pregnancy. Alex later breaks down in Izzie's arms, and the two kiss. Later in their relationship, Izzie begins hallucinating about Denny, and uncovers the fact she has Stage 4 metastatic melanoma with an estimated chance of 5% survival. It is revealed that Izzie's hallucinations of Denny are, in fact, caused by her tumor. Alex is shocked by the news, but finds the strength to stay by her side. Izzie plans a wedding for Meredith and Derek, but when Derek finds Izzie has another inoperable tumor in her brain, they give the wedding to Izzie and Alex, who marry in front of all their friends. Izzie debates whether or not she should undergo a risky surgery to remove her tumor and Alex supports her, but eventually insists that she should have the surgery. Alex performs CPR on Izzie after she flatlines. Izzie regains a heartbeat but is soon fired for making a treatment error that endangered the life of a patient, leaving Alex a Dear John letter and no clue as to her whereabouts. She later returns to the hospital when she found out Alex wasn‚Äôt the cause of her getting fired and went to make amends with him. She tells him she no longer has cancer and Alex says he is happy for her but he deserved someone who would stay. Izzie then leaves Seattle to start fresh and sends Alex divorce papers a few episodes later. Alex re-kindles an old flame with Lexie. Alex seems to have recently found that his calling is actually Peds and not Plastics as he had decided in the earlier seasons. Seeing Alex's ability to handle child patients, Dr. Arizona Robbins shows an interest in mentoring him for that specialization. Alex's brother Aaron comes to Seattle Grace for surgery, and lots of painful memories resurface because of this. Meredith discovers Alex, along with Aaron and their sister Amber, had been in foster care for five years when their mother could not take care of them. Alex is also served with divorce papers from Izzie. Alex is shot in the hospital by a deceased patient's husband, but survives with the help of Lexie and Mark. While undergoing treatment, he asked for Izzie (Imagine Lexie was Izzie) and told her never to leave again. Following the shooting, Lexie has a mental breakdown in front of Alex and he walks away. Dr. Bailey bars Alex from surgery until he has the bullet removed, which he later allows her to do. Alex realizes that his passion lies in pediatric surgery. He is further shown to be excellent with children, comforting with a young patient while growing her a new trachea. He immediately gets on the wrong side of new Pediatric attending Stark while Arizona is on leave. Alex then attempts to sleep with virgin April Kepner after visiting his mom in Iowa when his brother was diagnosed schizophrenia. Alex and Meredith perform an emergent surgery on a young boy by themselves during the night shift, dealing with the angry fallout from Stark (who would not answer his pager) but gaining the wordless approval of the Chief. Alex is thrilled when Arizona returns from Africa and hopes she will come to work for the hospital again. In the meantime, Alex falls for the new OBGYN attending, Lucy Fields, and they start a relationship after she kisses him. Alex finds out about Meredith sabotaging her Alzheimer's clinical trial and rats her out in attempt to get Chief Resident. The adoption counselor takes away Zola, the child Meredith wanted to adopt. Realizing his mistake, Alex apologizes to Meredith who forgives him shortly after. As the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Alex, prepare for their board exams for the different fellowships they plan on joining. Though Alex is late for his exam because he had to treat a patient, he ends up passing. Dr. Webber tells him that Johns Hopkins Hospital, which has the top program in the country, has been very impressed with him and has decided to create a position in pediatrics surgery for him and accepts the position. After finding out his decision, his current boss, Dr. Arizona Robbins, yells at him and takes his place on a plane that later crashes. Following the rescue of his colleagues, Robbins' health deteriorates and causes her leg to be amputated. He extends his stay at Seattle Grace until a replacement for Robbins is found, but when he learns that the replacement will send the exchange program to UCLA, he decides not to leave. Karev buys Meredith's old house from her, and Cristina becomes his roommate. Karev forms a friendship with a new intern, Jo Wilson that eventually develops into romantic feelings towards each other. Alex admits his love for Jo, and the two kiss and become a couple. Alex's estranged father, Jimmy, who he hasn't seen in 18 years, is admitted to the ER as a patient. After being discharged, Jimmy plays with his band at a bar, and Alex spends several nights watching his father perform onstage. Unknowing that Alex is his son, Jimmy confides in Alex that he had another family that he hasn't seen in years. This made Alex upset and he punched Jimmy at the bar. Once returning home, Alex unleashes his hurt and anger on Jo for having encouraged him to reconnect with his father. His father returns suffering from symptoms of withdrawal and hallucinations of the past where more is revealed about Alex's childhood. Jimmy tells Alex he knows that he is his son and Alex yells at his dad stating that \\"I WAS THE DAD\\". His dad later goes into cardiac arrest and is brought into surgery, fate unknown. Alex kisses Jo at April's wedding wanting to start a family with her. That night his dad died, due to a mistake by intern, Shane Ross, and Alex is upset. He punches Ross and is later comforted by Meredith. Upon the completion of his fellowship in Pediatric Surgery, Alex is given an offer to work at Dr. Oliver Lebackes' private practice office, claiming that he will have more flexible hours and \\"a big fat paycheck\\". Alex takes this offer happily. Robbins is initially angered by this decision and thinks that Alex is choosing money over substance. Eventually she realizes that he has become a wonderful surgeon and that she is happy to see him go. He later discovers that he isn't happy working at the private practice and expresses a desire to return full-time to Grey Sloan. When Cristina leaves for Switzerland, she leaves Alex her share of the board, including her seat. Alex is fired by Dr. Lebackes when Maggie Pierce accidentally reveals to him that Karev was thinking about leaving the job. Webber recommended Bailey to fill Yang's board seat after she left, so Bailey and Alex fight over the chair. They both make presentations to the board and eventually Bailey wins, with a unanimous vote in her favor. He is hired back as an attending Pediatric surgeon and takes over full-time as Arizona pursues a fellowship with Dr. Herman. Alex continues to date Jo and his friendship with Meredith grows stronger than ever, with him taking on the role of her new person. When Derek dies and Meredith runs away, Alex is upset by her leaving without telling him where she went and calls her everyday. Eventually she calls him, tells him she is okay, and to stop calling. When she goes into labor and gives birth to Ellis Shepherd, Alex goes to see her since he is her emergency contact. He brings Meredith and her kids back to her house. She asks to move back in with him in her old house. Alex sells Meredith back the house and he and Jo rent a loft. In the episode ‚ÄúI choose you‚Äù Jo finds an invoice from the fertility clinic housing Izzie and Alex‚Äôs frozen embryos. She then gets jealous of Alex wanting to have babies with Izzie while he asked her if she wanted a dog. Alex then gets mad telling her it is none of her business and storms out. Alex and Jo continue to struggle with their relationship. When Karev proposes to her, Jo tells him she can't marry him, so he breaks up with her. Later, Alex realizes that he misses Jo and gets her back. They seem to be doing well for some time, until Alex brings up marriage again and the two fight, as Jo still continues to argue that she cannot marry him. Alex storms out, leaving their relationship uncertain. Meredith and Alex lie on the grass and talk about love. On Jo rejecting his proposal, Alex then wonders if you get only one soulmate/true love and referred to Izzie. Meredith then told him Izzie wasn‚Äôt his true love and Alex told her Izzie was his Derek. During Owen and Amelia's wedding, Alex realizes that even though she won't marry him, he loves Jo and goes back to her again. However, when he arrives at their loft, he finds Jo highly intoxicated, wearing nothing but her bra and underwear, and surgical intern, Andrew Deluca lying on top of her. Alex assumes that Deluca was attempting to take advantage of Jo while she was inebriated and is filled with rage. He beats Deluca to a pulp with his bare hands. Andrew is badly injured, with his face bruised beyond recognition. He is unconscious and on the verge of dying. Alex realizes what he's done and quickly rushes Deluca to the hospital. There, the doctors call the police as they struggle to save Andrew and discover who did this to him. Alex lies to everyone and says that he found Andrew in this state and brought him to Grey Sloan. However, Ben Warren is suspicious of Karev. Meredith also quickly realizes that Alex was in fact the one who beat Deluca. She covers for him and the two continue to lie to everyone in the hospital about Alex's actions. Soon, Karev learns that Andrew wasn't doing anything wrong and that he had beaten up a good guy. Meredith decides that even though she loves Alex, she needs to turn him in. She goes to Bailey and tells her the truth. But, when the two rush to the police they find Alex being arrested for aggravated assault, as he had turned himself in. He is taken to jail and Meredith bails him out. While they wait for a trial, Bailey suspends Alex as an attending and makes him work in the clinic. Eventually, Jo finally tells Alex that the reason she couldn't marry Alex is because she is already married. Her husband is abusive and so she ran away and changed her name to Jo Wilson so that he wouldn't find her. Alex realizes that when Jo is called to the stand as a witness in the trial, this information about her past and lack of records under the name Jo Wilson may be revealed, and when the information goes public, her husband may find her. To keep her safe, he decides to take the plea deal without a trial, ensuring that he goes to jail for 2 years. However, when Alex tells Meredith this, she begs him not to and tells him that she can't lose him because she's already lost everyone else important in her life. Alex struggles to decide whether or not to take the plea deal. Meredith searches for Alex's case online, to find that the trial had been put off indefinitely. She assumes that he took the plea, and began calling and visiting various local jails to find him. After a full day of searching without finding him, she goes home to sleep, and discovers him sleeping in her bed. He explains he slept there all day. He explains that during his meeting with the D.A. Deluca came in and dropped all charges. Alex was then free to continue being Alex. After returning to work, Alex and Jo try to ignore each other and eventually build up a tolerance of sorts towards each other. Deluca and Alex continue to be at odds, especially when he becomes closer to Jo. However, nothing comes of it and they both keep their distance. At the end of the season, Alex hires an investigator to look for Jo's abusive husband. The investigator finds him and tells Alex that he will be at a conference. Meredith tells him it's a horrible idea and that he shouldn't go, especially considering Jo doesn't know about the situation. Alex flies out to the conference with the intention of telling him to get out of her life, no matter the means. When he meets him, Alex decides against confronting him over Jo, avoiding exposing her current identity and location and potentially stopping himself from assaulting someone yet again. He returns to Seattle, leaving the convention early. At the start of season 14, Alex and Jo start to warm to each other. Jo tells Deluca that she is still in love with Alex. Because Stephanie has left the hospital after an explosion that almost killed her, Jo turns to Warren to confide in. After she tells him her true feelings about the whole situation with Alex, Warren tells him that Jo is scared that he might hurt her. Alex goes to Jo and tells her that he could never abuse her like her husband did because he dealt with the same trauma as a kid as his father was abusive. He then tells her that he found her husband. Jo is taken back by this but when Alex tells her that he didn't kill or injure him in anyway, she is relieved and finally trusts him again. They then restart their relationship and Jo is now encouraged to file for divorce against her abusive husband. In the seventh episode, there was a pregnant Izzie look alike and Alex is taken aback and stammers when he talked to her. At the end of season 15, Alex is fired from his position as the head of Pediatric Surgery. The following season, he and Jo get married for a second time and helps save Meredith from losing her medical license. Midway through season 16, Alex reconnected with Izzie Stevens in the weeks leading up to Meredith's trial seeking her medical license to be reinstated. It was during that process that he chose to reach out to Izzie because he wanted to know if she was alive, okay and willing to be there in person for Meredith's trial. During the call, Alex heard two young voices in the background. It was then he discovered that Izzie had taken the embryos they had frozen during her cancer treatment and moved forward with IVF five to six years earlier and that they were his kids. He ultimately leaves Jo for Izzie, and moves to Kansas to be with her and their children. Development =Casting and creation= On January 10, 2020, Justin Chambers announced that he had departed the series after 15 years, in order to pursue other acting opportunities as well as to focus on his family. His final episode had aired on November 14, 2019. The fate of his character was addressed in the season 16 episode \\"Leave a Light On.\\" =Characterization= The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) characterized Karev as \\"honest\\", \\"always tells it like it is\\", while also citing his mouth, his punctuality and him being a \\"smart-ass\\" as his weaknesses. Shonda Rhimes said of Karev: \\"I love that we have a character who can do something wonderful but still be a selfish cranky ass about it. Alex gets to be complex in ways most characters don't because even though he's got a moral code, his moral code is totally twisted and dark. But he's essentially good ‚Äì deep down inside.\\" Carolina Paiz, one of the writers of the series, wrote: \\"He has so much going on inside... you think you've got him figured out but then he just reveals this whole other side to him.\\" \\"He is superficial sleazeball who turns out to be a nice guy and a talented doctor with an amazing bedside manner, as well as the budding love interest of Katherine Heigl's character Izzie.\\" DVD Verdict wrote of the character's development in the fourth season: \\"Love him, hate him, or both, Karev speaks his mind, rough edges and all. But ultimately his cold heart seems to be softened by his blossoming relationship with Jane Doe/Ava/Rebecca.\\" Rhimes felt that the 100th episode during which Karev marries Stevens showed how he had grown up: \\"Look at him. Standing at the altar and saying those vows like a man. (...) He's become a man who can step up. And I love him for it.\\" =Relationships= Although Karev and Stevens had an on-off romantic history in previous seasons, it was not until the fifth season that the two formed a lasting relationship. Despite Stevens' advanced skin cancer, the two marry. Justin Chambers commented on his character's inability to tell Stevens that he loves her in the beginning of their relationship, saying that Karev has difficulty expressing himself. Though Stevens departs in season 6, series creator Shonda Rhimes has said that she would like the chance to create closure for both Karev and Stevens. Rhimes later retracted her comments and stated that she has no plans to ever re- approach Izzie's storyline again.Grey's Anatomy Boss Shonda Rhimes Crushes My Katherine Heigl Comeback Dream: 'I'm Done With That Story' TV Line, Retrieved August 6, 2015 In the ninth season, Karev befriends intern Jo Wilson. They begin a relationship in the tenth season until their break-up in the twelfth season. However, they get back together again and marry in the fourteenth season. Karev later leaves Jo and gets back together with his ex-wife Izzie Stevens in season 16. Reception Analyzing Alex Karev, Rachel Simon called him \\"underrated;\\" she pointed out that Alex's personal growth never seems to get acknowledged, as \\"Alex begins Grey's as an arrogant, obnoxious intern who pushes away anyone who tries to care about him. He breaks Izzie's heart 1,000 times, and then acts surprised when she falls for someone else. He sleeps with any girl who will have him, insults everyone who doesn't, and generally enjoys being the hospital asshole. Yet, over the course of 10 seasons Alex has evolved, slowly and realistically, into a genuinely good person whose faults don't miraculously disappear, but take a backseat to much better qualities.\\" Former television columnist for The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall disapproved of Karev's flirt with Addison as \\"he should take interest in a woman's speciality and respect his boss without getting in her pants.\\" Reviewing the fifth season, Chris Monfette of IGN wrote: \\"Alex, who'd become simply the cast's angry outcast, was uplifted as his relationship with Izzie became more and more substantial, and his bedside scenes with her toward the end were some of his character's best material yet.\\" On his career path as a pediatric surgeon, Examiner wrote, \\"Despite his rough exterior, Alex has a certain child-like innocence and need for acceptance. He is keen in recognizing these traits in kids, as well. He reaches out to kids on many levels.\\" and added, \\"Alex has major trust issues. Maybe it was the constant beatings from his father. Or, his mother's mental illness. Or, being shuffled through 17 foster homes over a 5-year period. Who wouldn't have issues with a childhood like that?\\"  References  Specific General *  External links  *Grey's Anatomy at ABC.com Category:Grey's Anatomy characters Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Fictional characters from Iowa Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Alex Karev"},{"id":"7687024","text":"George O'Malley, M.D. is a fictional character from the medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which airs on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and was portrayed by actor T. R. Knight from 2005 to 2009. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, O'Malley worked his way up to resident level, while his relationships with his colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) formed a focal point of the series. O'Malley married Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) from whom he later separated to pursue a relationship with Stevens. O'Malley also had entertained romantic interests with Grey and Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback). Knight auditioned for the show, expecting a 1-season run. In 2007, Knight's co-star Isaiah Washington (Preston Burke) insulted him with a homophobic slur, which resulted in the termination of Washington's Grey's Anatomy contract. In 2009, after the conclusion of the fifth season, it was confirmed that Knight would not be returning for the show's sixth season. The actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a \\"breakdown in communication\\" with Rhimes, his character's lack of screen-time, as well as his decision to come out as openly gay. Knight received positive reviews for his performance as O'Malley, and garnered a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. Despite this, his death received mixed feedback from critics and audiences.  Storylines  George O'Malley is introduced as a fellow surgical intern along with Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers); the 5 of them working under Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). O'Malley and Stevens move in with Meredith, for whom he has romantic feelings but did not express them due to his fear of rejection and the fact that she and one of the attendings Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) had a mutual interest in one another. On the first day of internship, O'Malley is selected by chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) as the first intern to perform surgery. He freezes in the operating room, and is mocked by his peers, and earns the nickname \\"007\\" because of almost killing a patient in such a simple operation (referring to James Bond's \\"license to kill\\"). O'Malley dates nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), breaking up with her when he contracts syphilis from her, which she in turn contracted from Karev. His friendship with Karev is further strained when the two become trapped in an elevator with a patient who begins to bleed out. Karev freezes, and O'Malley is able to save the patient single- handedly. He goes on to admit his feelings to Meredith, and the two have a one-night stand. When Meredith tells him that sleeping together was a mistake, O'Malley begins avoiding her and starts dating orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). During a camping trip, O'Malley learns that Torres has slept with chief of plastic surgery Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and also discovers that Burke is experiencing tremors in his hand. When O'Malley's father is diagnosed with esophageal cancer and a leaking aortic valve, he refuses to allow Burke to operate on him, instead contacting Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), Burke's medical school rival. His relationship with Torres is strained when he confronts her about sleeping with Sloan, but he allows her to support him through his father's deteriorating health. Complications from his father's surgery leave him in multi-system organ failure, and his life support is turned off. In an attempt to overcome his grief, O'Malley elopes with Callie to Las Vegas. He later begins to feel that he was mistaken to marry her, and sleeps with Stevens while intoxicated. Stevens confesses that she is in love with him, so O'Malley considers transferring to a different hospital so he can be faithful to his wife. However, he is ineligible to transfer after failing the intern exams. O'Malley decides to repeat his intern year, and confesses to Torres that he slept with Stevens, leading the two to separate. O'Malley and Stevens embark on a short-lived relationship, only to discover there is no real chemistry between them. O'Malley moves in with new intern Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's half-sister. Lexie and O'Malley discover that he failed his exam by only a single point, leading him to confront Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), the chief of surgery, to ask for a chance to retake the exam. He passes the second attempt, and begins to distance himself from Lexie, who has fallen in love with him. O'Malley supports Stevens when she discovers she has melanoma, and walks her down the aisle as she marries Karev. O'Malley begins to display a talent for trauma surgery, and is told by the chief of trauma surgery Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) that it is definitely his specialty. He then abruptly and inexplicably decides to join the U.S. Army in Iraq. While his friends at the hospital prepare an intervention to convince O'Malley to stay, they all work on a severely disfigured John Doe, brought in after a horrible bus accident, in which he pushed a woman out of the way and saved her life. John Doe writes on Meredith's hand \\"007\\" and she realizes it is actually George. She runs to tell the other surgeons and they rush him to surgery. However, he flatlines and is ultimately declared braindead. There is confusion on if John Doe is really George and Callie confirms by a freckle on his hand. His organs are donated after Stevens confirms that it is what O'Malley would have wanted, and he is buried a week later. Development =Casting and creation= T. R.

Knight signed on for the pilot as O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the character was multi-faceted. In October 2006, news reports surfaced that Washington had insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an argument with Patrick Dempsey. Shortly after, the details of the argument became public, and Knight later disclosed that the slur made him come out as gay. \\"I was under no delusions,\\" Knight said at the time. \\"My friends on the set knew. We talked about it. Publicly it's not my thing to call up People magazine and be like, 'Hey, you want to know something about me?'...I could've just let it slide and not said anything, but it became important. It became important to make the statement.\\" The situation seemed somewhat resolved when Washington issued a statement, apologizing for his \\"unfortunate use of words during the recent incident on-set\\". Isaiah Washington insulted T. R. Knight with a homophobic slur. At the 64th Golden Globe Awards, while being interviewed on the red carpet, Washington joked, \\"I love gay. I wanted to be gay. Please let me be gay.\\" Later, Washington claimed he never used the slur, labeling it \\"vile\\". In June 2007, it was reported that the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Shonda Rhimes had chosen not to renew Washington's contract with the show, not immediately specifying a reason. In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that \\"they fired the wrong guy\\" (referring to Knight), and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey's Anatomy.\\"Grey's star says they fired the wrong guy\\", Houston Chronicle. June 21, 2007. Retrieved September 2, 2012. On July 2, 2007, Washington appeared on Larry King Live, to present his side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the \\"F-Word\\" in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument \\"provoked\\" by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a \\"B-word\\", a \\"P-word\\", and the \\"F-word\\", which Washington said conveyed \\"somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back\\".\\"Interview transcript\\" July 2, 2007. Cable News Network. In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: \\"I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience.\\" Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: \\"I remember saying [to fellow executive producer], 'This is our proudest day here. T. R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting.\\" In December 2008, reports speculated that Knight requested to be released from his contract and that \\"they were working out the details\\" at that time. In June 2009, after the conclusion of the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy, it was confirmed that Knight would not be returning for the show's sixth season. The actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a \\"breakdown in communication\\" with Rhimes, O'Malley's lack of screen-time, as well as his decision to be openly gay. Prior to the official announcement of his departure, there was speculation that the role of O'Malley would be recast, but Rhimes labeled it as a \\"hilarious, ridiculous rumor\\". After the confirmation of his exit, Knight told TV Guide: \\"Leaving Grey's Anatomy was not an easy decision for me to make. I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to play this character and will miss my fellow cast and crew very much. I continue to wish them the very best, and wholeheartedly thank all of the fans who have supported me and the show with such passion and enthusiasm.\\" In a statement confirming Knight's departure, Rhimes said: \\"I think I speak for the entire Grey's Anatomy family when I say we wish T. R. Knight the best in his future endeavors. He is an incredibly talented actor and a person whose strength of character is admired by all of us.\\" In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried to talk him out of quitting, explaining: \\"I looked in his face and he was really sure. It felt like the right thing for him.\\" However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: \\"My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [about O'Malley].\\" Knight was \\"at peace\\" with his departure, saying: \\"There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision.\\" However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: \\"I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [glad] for him because he was ready to go.\\" On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: \\"From an outsider's perspective, I get the [impression that] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn't know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work.\\" =Characterization= O'Malley was characterized a \\"hapless naif\\". On the topic of O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: \\"What's going to be very interesting to see is what he's going to do with Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life.\\" After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight said in an interview with Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: \\"George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her.\\" He also added that, \\"I think George has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered.\\" Series writer Stacy McKee said of the sexual encounter: \\"There's no turning back. There's nothing George and Meredith can do. The damage is done ‚Äì things will never be the same. They've just changed something important in their lives forever.\\" When asked if O'Malley was becoming more assertive, Knight said: Knight also commented that the character does not appreciate himself and his positive traits. On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: \\"It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.' The big thing about the open- heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs to be kind of kicked in the (butt) to do these things.\\" Knight felt a parallel to George in that his \\"confidence isn't always at its absolute highest\\", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts to think he is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. \\"I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand.\\" Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: \\"They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it.\\" Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: \\"I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere ‚Äì we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater.\\" When asked what his \\"favorite George moment\\" was, Knight said his relationships with Stevens and Bailey. Reception Callie Torres' relationship with O'Malley was initially criticized. Fans were \\"widely against\\" O'Malley's affair with Meredith in the second season, however certain fans who supported their relationship were critical when Torres was introduced as a love-interest for him. Fans and critics were also against O'Malley's relationship with Stevens in the fourth season; Maclean's said: \\"George must die. He's slept with virtually everyone except the male cast and has been in love with virtually everyone except the male cast. And he's not that great of a doctor. Evolve or die.\\" Christopher Monfette of IGN said O'Malley and Stevens were a \\"mismatch\\", adding: \\"Unfortunately, while it's refreshing to see a plotline driven by activity vs. apathy, the idea of these two ever-affable, best-friend characters suddenly discovering their potential, out-of-nowhere love for each other quickly feels both force-fed and emotionally-incorrect.\\" Similarly, DVD Verdict stated that George and Izzie were \\"one of the strongest 'best-friend' vibes on television\\" for the first 3 seasons, explaining \\"they were perfect as friends [while] George and Callie made a good couple.\\" UGO.com put the two on their list of \\"Character Couples Who Should Have Never Happened\\". Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly said that when O'Malley told Torres about his affair with Stevens, the scene was too \\"melodramatic\\". Laura Burrows, also of IGN, said that the fourth season premiere \\"introduced a new side of George\\". Armstrong said of O'Malley and Stevens' reconciliation: \\"George and Izzie are finally on the old Grey's Anatomy road to ruin. And I admit this is a good lesson in Grey's viewing as well as life: Sit tight if you hate something, as nothing is permanent.\\" Armstrong also commented that the \\"sparkling\\" friendship development between O'Malley and Lexie \\"won her over\\". The following year, Monfette observed of O'Malley's lack of screen-time: \\"His growing interest in trauma surgery at the side of Owen leads to an interesting development in the finale, but the character is virtually sidelined this season.\\" Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times said of the character's death: \\"The time- lapse episode was an interesting choice, and though we sped through six weeks of mourning in 2 hours, it didn't feel rushed to me. I'm not sure the show could have held my attention for another season of crippling sadness.\\" The Huffington Post Michael Pascua commented that O'Malley's funeral did not live up to his expectations, writing that it \\"wasn't as sad as [he] thought it would be\\". In 2006, Knight and the other cast of Grey's Anatomy were nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, at the 12th Screen Actors Guild Awards. Also in 2006, the cast won the award for Best Cast ‚Äì Television Series at the 11th Satellite Awards. The cast won the award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and were nominated again the following year. Knight's performance in season 3 earned him a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.

The character was created by series creator and producer Shonda Rhimes, and has been portrayed by actress Chandra Wilson since the show's inception in 2005. Wilson has reprised her role in the spin- off series Private Practice and Station 19. Introduced as a resident in general surgery at Seattle Grace Hospital, Bailey works her way up to the attending physician level, and is eventually named Chief of Surgery. Her relationship with the five surgical interns she is in charge of - Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) - is a focal point at the beginning of the series. Storyline Miranda Bailey married Tucker Jones in 1995 and is a Wellesley College graduate. She is introduced to the interns as \\"The Nazi\\" in the first season premiere because of her tough personality and blunt attitude. When she was still a resident, Webber once pointed out that she disliked nearly every attending she worked under; the attendings take her seriously due to her formidable reputation as an excellent surgeon. Off the bat she tells her interns to \\"not bother sucking up cause I already hate you and that's not going to change\\"; however, Miranda's more motherly and protective side is exhibited, as she is shown to care about not only her patients, but also her colleagues. She is protective of her interns, as shown when she warns Derek to stay away from Meredith. Miranda stays beside Cristina's side as she recovers from surgery. It is later revealed that she has been married to her husband Tucker Jones (Cress Williams) for ten years and that she is pregnant. Her son is born during a bomb scare at Seattle Grace while her husband is being treated in surgery for injuries from a car crash. George O'Malley helped her through labor, and she thanked him by naming her son William George Bailey Jones (though he is nicknamed \\"Tuck\\"). Bailey adjusts to becoming a parent and reconciling this with her desire to continue her career as a surgeon. Her professional confidence was shaken and questioned by other surgeons when Izzie Stevens cut Denny Duquette's LVAD wire and Denny subsequently died. Christina kept Burke's secret about his disabled hand, and Bailey felt that she wasn't in control of her interns, and that she was ultimately responsible for these incidents. Dr. Richard Webber, Chief of Surgery, comforts her saying \\"You raised them like babies, and some of them turn out just like you\\". Disillusioned by how little she can help patients as a surgeon, Bailey pushes to open a free clinic at Seattle Grace. Izzie helps pay for it from a multi-million dollar bequest from Denny Duquette, whom she had loved. Bailey loses the post of Chief Resident to Callie Torres. Bailey decides to back up Torres, which the Chief observes. He says that he made a mistake in not choosing Bailey in the first place. Miranda helped save the life of a white supremacist paramedic despite his racist treatment of her. When closing his stomach after the surgery, she comments to George that the incision will need to be aligned better, thus ruining the patient's large swastika tattoo on his stomach. Following severe injuries to her son and several arguments over the state of their marriage, Dr. Bailey and her husband separated. Realizing that she cannot perform surgery and direct the clinic, Bailey chooses Izzie Stevens for the position. She has shown both commitment and talent for it. After watching the residents fight after the chance to do a solo surgery, Bailey realizes that she has become somewhat bored with General Surgery and may need a change of specialty. She became drawn to Pediatric surgery after working on a number of pediatric cases and working closely with, (and having many arguments with), Arizona Robbins, a pediatric surgeon. Chief Webber is unhappy with Bailey's decision to leave General Surgery, and discouraged her at every opportunity, giving her an uninspiring letter of recommendation and purchasing a surgical robot to lure her back to General Surgery. Ultimately, Bailey decided to continue to pursue her career in General Surgery because she had a fight with her husband who said that if she accepted a position as a Peds fellow, he would divorce her. She decides to go through with the divorce and states there will be no time to start a new specialty as a single mom. When Izzie Stevens is diagnosed with cancer that has a 5% survival rate, Bailey supports Stevens through her rounds of chemo and cancer treatments. After declining a fellowship in Pediatrics, Bailey starts as an Attending in General Surgery. Bailey is so deeply saddened by the news of George's death and Izzie's near-death that she realizes that she is caring about them like her own children. She begins a relationship with the anesthesiologist from Mercy West, Ben Warren. A gunman enters the hospital, believing that the staff had failed his wife. He shoots several people, including resident Charles Percy, whom Bailey is unable to save because the elevators are shut down during the crisis and she can't get him to an OR. She grows close with a patient, Mary Portman when she fights to save Charles' life. Charles dies in Miranda's lap. As Miranda comforts him, Charles says, \\"You [Bailey] were always my favorite, I thought you should know\\". Distraught by these experiences, Bailey takes time off to visit her parents with her son. On her return, she breaks up with Ben. Mary Portman returns for her surgery, which appears to go well, but she does not wake up. They cannot discover what caused her death. Miranda starts on a quest to cure fistulas and encounters a nurse, Eli, whom she starts dating. Bailey is offended when Meredith violates the rules of the Alzheimer's clinical trial in order to help the Chief's wife. She berates Meredith; the Chief resigns as head of surgery because of Meredith's action. Bailey resumes control of Ellis Grey's Diabetes trial, and Webber pushes her to forgive Meredith and choose her as staff for the trial. Bailey forgives Meredith. She breaks off her relationship with Eli, not wanting to pursue it further, and renews her relationships with Ben the anesthesiologist. She eventually moves in with him, but he gains a surgical internship in California. They become engaged nonetheless, and new interns at SGMW refer to her as BCB (\\"Booty Call Bailey\\"): whenever Ben is in town she is giddy and has sex with him as much as possible. On the way to her wedding, Bailey is pulled in to perform surgery on Richard's wife, Adele. After saving Adele, she returns to the venue and marries Ben. She launches a genome mapping program, and Meredith is the first one to test it. An investigation of Bailey takes place after three of her patients contracted an infection and died. It concludes that Bailey transmitted the infection via permeable gloves, a new brand that the hospital started using. Following that incident, Bailey shuts everyone out for some time, because she feels that she is dirty and contaminated. She blamed Dr. Webber the most for abandoning her and avoids him altogether. Eventually, her husband, Ben, flies to Seattle to get her out of the genome lab. In the first part of the season finale, Bailey returns to work but does not go into the surgical OR. Eventually, with Dr. Webber's stern push, she decides to be on the OR rotation for the upcoming storm along with her intern, Shane Ross. Webber suffers electrical injuries and Bailey takes him as a patient. Bailey's husband Ben returns for Halloween and says that he has dropped out of residency to spend more time with her and Tuck. Bailey is not impressed by this decision, and starts exhibiting some odd behaviors. Ben suggests that Bailey might have developed OCD after what happened with the CDC investigation. Dr Bailey gets very upset when Ben shows interest as a Fire Fighter, after the Fire Incident when Dr Edwards sets fire in Grey Sloan Memorial to defend her from the Rapist (Rings of Fire). He claims to give him \\"The Rush\\". Later that season, Miranda Bailey gets hospitalized due to a heart attack. In Season 16 Bailey fires Meredith after she commits insurance fraud to save one of her patients. Shortly after she is told by Maggie she is both pregnant with her second child and perimenopausal. In the fall finale of Season 16 Bailey suffers a miscarriage.  Development  = Casting and creation = Shonda Rhimes wrote the character of Bailey to be a petite blonde-haired white woman with curls as \\"it would be unexpected to have this sweet-looking person open her mouth and say tough things.\\" However, Wilson's audition went so well that she was offered the part, and the character was rewritten. Sandra Oh was originally going to audition for the part of Dr. Bailey. Of her role, Wilson said: \\"I thought it was endearing; endearing as the word 'Nazi' can be.\\" Wilson explained how she plays Bailey: = Characterization = Bailey has been characterized as \\"straightforward\\", \\"tough\\", and \\"quick-witted\\" by Grey's Anatomy executives. Reflecting on her character, Chandra Wilson said: \\"I think a strength and a weakness for her is her ego. The strength part is great because it really does make her a really good physician. She's really good at her job and she continues to evolve and she continues to look at ways to be 'value added' at the hospital and is incredibly independent. That independence has certainly gotten in the way of her personal relationships. It's gotten in the way of her being a team player on many occasions.\\"  Reception USA Today TV critic wrote in 2006 that Emmy voters could consider Chandra Wilson because she adds \\"warmth and humor to Bailey without making her go all squishy.\\" Reviewing the show's fourth season, Patrick Luce of Monsters and Critics found Bailey \\"one of the most interesting characters to watch\\" as \\"she had to deal with losing a promotion to Sara Ram√≠rez‚Äôs Dr. Torres; her own marriage trouble; and the continued stress of balancing being a mom and being a doctor.\\" He also appreciated the fact that people got to see \\"a softer side\\" of her while she kept \\"all the biting satire and sarcasm that made the character great.\\" Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times deemed Bailey and Sam her favorite pairing of the Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice crossover, praising: \\"The grief he gave her about becoming a pediatric surgeon ‚Ä¶ the grief she gave him for letting ex-wife Naomi go and wind up in the arms of Archer ‚Ä¶ the fist bump. I say again, the fist bump! Together, Chandra Wilson and Taye Diggs are hilarious and touching and all sorts of fabulous. Here‚Äôs hoping this isn‚Äôt the last we ever see of this unexpectedly dynamic duo.\\" Fellow Los Angeles Times critic, Carina MacKenzie, welcomed Bailey's \\"flirtation\\" with Ben (Jason George) because it was \\"nice to see her fun, flirty side\\" presented with a bit of humor after the deterioration of her relationship with Tucker. Margaret Lyons of New York Magazine was happy with the evolution of Bailey and Torres' friendship in the first half of the ninth season, calling it \\"the one bright spot\\": \\"They joke, they tease each other, they offer sage love advice to one another, now that they're both on their second marriages.\\" Entertainment Weekly included Bailey in its list of the \\"30 Great TV Doctors and Nurses\\". AOL TV named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters. Chandra Wilson has received multiple nominations for her portrayal of Dr. Miranda Bailey. She won a 2007 Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance in the show's third season. She has been nominated each year from 2006 to 2009 at the Emmy Awards for \\"Supporting Actress in a Drama Series\\", losing in 2007 to co-star Katherine Heigl in the role of Izzie Stevens for the performance in the episode \\"Oh, the Guilt\\". She has also been praised for her performance in Grey's Anatomy at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, receiving three nominations along with the other cast members for \\"Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series\\" each year from 2006 to 2008, with the 2007 Awards marking a victory.

The character was created by series' producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by Sara Ramirez. She was introduced in season 2, as a senior orthopedic resident, as a love-interest for intern George O'Malley (T. R. Knight). Eventually becoming an attending orthopedic surgeon, the character was originally contracted to appear on a recurring basis, but received star- billing in season 3. Torres was initially conceived as a love-interest, and eventual wife, for O'Malley, and was created to be disliked by her colleagues. Further storylines include relationships between her and plastic surgeon, Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), as well as a marriage to pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw). The character's bisexual storyline with Hahn and Robbins, and her development later in the series has garnered high critical acclaim. She is also the longest-running LGBT character in television history, appearing in 11 seasons and 239 episodes. Ramirez's portrayal of Torres has been widely praised by television critics and the character gained significant popularity as the series progressed. Ramirez was nominated for several awards for her portrayal of Torres, including the Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and the ALMA Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Television Series. The character was ranked at #7 by AfterEllen.com in the list of \\"Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters.\\" At the end of the show's twelfth season, Ramirez departed the show after 10 years, desiring to take a break. Storylines Callie Torres is introduced as an orthopedic surgery resident with a crush on intern George O'Malley (T. R. Knight). The two start a relationship and Torres moves into Meredith's house (Meredith and Izzie Stevens lived there as well). Uneased at the way their relationship is progressing, O'Malley confronts her, which results in her moving into a hotel. In the aftermath of the breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas on the spur of the moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow intern Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces her desire to conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. Though her personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident. However, she soon begins struggling to cope in the role, and is demoted soon thereafter. Torres forms a friendship with Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), the hospital's new chief of cardiothoracic surgery. The two embark on a relationship when Hahn jokingly kisses Torres in an elevator to tease Sloan. Neither has been with another woman before, and Torres struggles with her bisexuality, and cheats on her with Sloan. She is initially forgiven, but after an argument about work, Hahn resigns from Seattle Grace, ending their relationship. New pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) kisses her, and they begin dating. Their relationship is tested when Torres comes out to her father, Carlos, who disowns her, cutting her off both financially and emotionally. When she is not granted a position as an attending, she publicly berates the chief, Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), and resigns from her post. She begins working at the neighboring Mercy West hospital, and when the two hospitals merge, she is promoted to an attending surgeon. Torres' father returns yet again, to condemn her, but ultimately accepts her sexuality. When Torres explains her desire to bear children, Robbins expresses disappointment, and their differing stances on the matter lead them to break up. Soon thereafter, a gunman commits mass murder at the hospital, and, relieved to have survived, Torres and Robbins reconcile, with Robbins agreeing that they should have children together. When Robbins wins a prestigious grant to help treat children in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position will last for three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, and they have a one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s attitude toward the wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony. In the aftermath of a plane accident that killed Sloan and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Torres is forced to make the decision to have Alex Karev amputate Robbins's left leg to keep her alive, which puts strains on their relationship. The hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim, including Robbins, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. These doctors and Torres buy the hospital with the help of the Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Everything seems to go well for Arizona and Callie, until a big storm hits the hospital now named after Mark Sloan and Lexie Grey. In the last episode of the ninth season, Arizona cheats on Callie with Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton). Callie soon discovers Arizona's infidelity by seeing her wedding ring pinned to Dr. Boswell's scrub top. In the aftermath of discovery, both Callie and Arizona share their feelings and it is revealed that Arizona does not forgive Callie for making the call to amputate her leg. Callie is heartbroken and Arizona states that Callie lost nothing in the crash, to which Callie responds that she, apparently, lost Arizona. Callie takes Sofia to live with Meredith and Derek, Zola, and Baby Bailey for a while before kicking Arizona out of their apartment and celebrates by dancing in her underwear. Callie also left Arizona at therapy, telling her that she was the only one that needed to go. After being hit by a lawsuit, her father, Carlos, visits and tells Callie that he cheated on her mother but she took him back and Callie wouldn't be here if her mother didn't give Carlos a second chance. Callie goes to Arizona's apartment and invites her to come back home. Callie finds out during surgery that Arizona was sleeping with Leah, a second year resident, while separated. Although angry at Arizona, Callie still agrees to work things out. After April's failed wedding to Matthew, Callie and Arizona bought a house together, a fresh start, away from the memories of their apartment. They later decided to try again for a second child. However, a trip to the OB/GYN led to the discovery that Callie had developed adhesions in her uterus in the years since Sofia's birth, meaning she could not carry any more babies. After talking about it, the couple agreed to postpone their dream to have another baby until they're on more solid footing as a couple. At the beginning of the eleventh season, Callie and Arizona gave therapy another chance in order to help mend their marriage. They were made to go 30 days living separate lives in the same house with no sexual activity with others or each other. They come close to breaking that rule and had to start over and before the 30 days was up they eventually gave in and connected sexually again. At the end of the 30 days at the final therapy session Arizona realized she couldn't live without Callie; however Callie didn't feel the same and stated she felt suffocated and eventually walked out of therapy, ending their marriage. Callie then goes on to date Penny, who was the resident in charge of Derek Shepherd's case. She comes to a dinner party hosted by Meredith, who recognizes her. It is then discovered that Penny is going to be working at Grey Sloan Memorial. When everyone, including Callie, finds out who Penny actually is, they protest and try to get her off of the Grey Sloan Memorial residency line. She manages to stay on the line despite all the others' pleads and wishes. After Callie discloses her desire to move to New York with Penny and take her and Arizona's daughter, Sofia, with her, Arizona takes Callie to court for sole parental custody. Callie eventually loses custody of her daughter to Arizona and breaks up with Penny, heartbroken, Penny moves to New York. After Arizona decides that both Sofia's moms deserve to be happy, Arizona presents Callie with plane tickets and offers a custody agreement that keeps Sofia in Seattle for the summer and then sharing her every other school year and Christmas. Callie is referenced occasionally by Arizona and Sofia after her departure from the show. At the conclusion of season 14, Arizona departs the show to move to New York and it is implied that the two reconciled after Callie and Penny had broken up. Development =Casting & Creation= Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, and she chose Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know whom to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, \\"Pick a show, any show\\", explaining that it is rare. Shonda Rhimes said: \\"I was looking for a girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so I had no idea what I was looking for.\\" Rhimes built the character around Ramirez after she met her. Ramirez's character was initially given recurring status in the second season and received star billing in the third season, alongside fellow cast member Dane, who portrayed Mark Sloan. Ramirez discusses maintaining relationships with co-stars: =Characterization= The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) characterized Torres as \\"driven\\", \\"determined\\", and \\"outgoing\\", while also noting her weaknesses: \\"defensive\\" and \\"impulsive\\". Ramirez described her character as someone who \\"appears to be a certain way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time.\\" At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her getting in the way of O'Malley and Meredith Grey's (Ellen Pompeo) relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: \\"You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that storyline. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff.\\" The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau \\"Eri-Cal\\" and later \\"Callica\\" by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: \\"Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show ‚Äî it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty.\\" Torres served as the primary vocalist in the show's musical episode, \\"Song Beneath the Song\\", being described as \\"amazing\\" by fellow cast member, Kevin McKidd. She explained that in developing the relationship between the two: \\"we wanted it to be real ‚Äì not some stunt to get people talking. We wanted to see what would happen if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman.\\" The 2 characters shared a kiss at the end of the season 4 finale, with which D. Williams of AfterEllen.com noted: \\"Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that 2 regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship.\\" Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; \\"They were really wanting to be truthful to the 2 characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship\\", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: \\"they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it. ... I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of ‚Äî I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. You could tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry.\\" In the show's fifth season, Torres embarked on a relationship with Arizona Robbins (Capshaw). Fans refer to the relationship between the two by the portmanteau \\"Calzona\\" (for Callie + Arizona). Rhimes praised the chemistry between Callie and Arizona in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Grey and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), and stating: \\"They have that little thing that makes you want to watch them.\\" In \\"An Honest Mistake\\", Torres was initially rejected by Robbins, with Robbins citing Torres' \\"inexperience\\" as a factor. Series writer Peter Nowalk offered the insight: The couple ultimately decided to begin a relationship, however, the two experience difficulties, but eventually reunite. Rhimes commented on their reconciliation: \\"I love [Callie] with Arizona. ... I like that they make me feel hopeful about love.\\" Rhimes has mentioned of their relationship in season 6: \\"I would like to see Callie happily in a long-term relationship. We have so much to explore with them, because we barely know anything about [Arizona].\\" Callie and Arizona have a five-year relationship, ultimately marrying in season 7 and divorcing in season 11. Callie starts a new relationship with Penny Blake and leaves to go to New York with her in the season 12 finale. Shonda Rhimes spoke on Ramirez's abrupt departure, saying, \\"This one was different because it wasn't a big planned thing. I had a different plan going and when Sara came in and said, 'I really need to take this break,' I was lucky that we'd shot the end of the season with her going to New York.\\" Reception Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune was critical about the character's initial development. Reviewing the season 3 premiere, she wrote the writers should give up on Callie explaining they have made her \\"far too obviously the \\"weird girl,\\" but there's nothing underneath her brusque persona.\\" Her marriage to O'Malley was well-received; Staci Krause of IGN wrote: \\"Their relationship has been a roller-coaster and it was nice to see this turn of events, as she really is a perfect contrast to George.\\" Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Hahn, Williams was largely positive, assessing that: \\"The storyline offered both the drama Grey's is known for and a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships.\\" Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: \\"I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. ... [It] was more like a conquest, like he could have [Hahn] too or something.\\" LGBT website AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Sloan's point of view, as though \\"privileging the male-gaze.\\" AfterEllen.com included Torres in their list of the Top 50 Lesbian & Bisexual Characters, ranking her at #6 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. The character was also listed in Wetpaint's \\"10 Hottest TV Doctors on TV\\". Commenting on Hahn's abrupt departure from the show, Dorothy Snarker, writing for AfterEllen.com, observed of Torres and Robbins' relationship: \\"I ... can't help but be wary of how the Grey's writers will handle this relationship. Jessica has proven lovely and likable in her brief screen-time so far. But it's not how the romance starts, but what happens next that really matters.\\" Speaking of the musical episode, Nicole Golden of TV Fanatic called Ramirez's rendition of \\"Chasing Cars\\" \\"amazing\\" and referred to her performance in Kate Havnevik's \\"Grace\\" as \\"beautiful\\". Margaret Lyons of New York Magazine was happy with the evolution of Bailey and Torres' friendship in the first-half of season 9, calling it \\"the one bright-spot\\": \\"They joke, they tease each other, they offer sage love advice to one another, now that they're both on their second marriages.\\" Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Television Series at the Alma Awards, in 2007 and 2008. Also in 2007, at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards, Ramirez and the cast of Grey's Anatomy, were the recipients of the Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. She and the cast were nominated for the same award, in 2008. In 2011, at the 42nd NAACP Image Awards, Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

The character is portrayed by actor James Pickens Jr., and was created by Shonda Rhimes. He was previously the Chief of Surgery at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital for 12 years, and was replaced briefly by Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and later Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Background Richard married his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine) on Valentine's Day. During their residency at Seattle Grace, he had an affair with Meredith's mother, Ellis Grey, although both were married. Although Ellis left her husband, Richard could not bring himself to leave his wife, Adele (he would learn decades later that Adele had known about the affair all along and stayed with him anyway). He confessed in a later episode that he ended the affair because he believed that Ellis deserved better and that he had too much baggage. After completing his residency, Richard left Seattle Grace to complete his fellowship. There are continuity errors regarding where exactly Richard built his career; at one point he states that with the exception of his fellowship, he spent his entire career at Seattle Grace. However, it is also established that he both taught and befriended Addison and Derek, presumably in New York (the majority of references within the show, as well as additional sources, indicate that a good portion of Richard's career was spent in Manhattan, rather than Seattle). He graduated from Northwestern University (as shown in the degree in his office) Storylines The enigmatic Chief of Surgery at Seattle Grace is a leading figure in the show. Always vigilant, seeking and trying new things, his ambition is to see Seattle Grace as the top surgical program in the country. This sometimes leads him to take daring decisions, at the beginning of the first season the Surgical Program is presented as one of the best in the United States. Later in the series his wife Adele asks him to retire, forcing him to choose between his career or their marriage. He tries to skirt around it, but Adele, tired of waiting, makes her choice and leaves him. He moves out and sleeps in his office for a short time. Since learning of Ellis Grey's illness, Richard had been visiting her regularly, but upon deciding to attempt a reconciliation with Adele, he realizes that he can no longer continue his emotional affair with Ellis. He attempts to patch things up with his wife, but is stunned to find out that she has apparently moved on to someone else. In the meantime, Richard makes plans to retire and must name his successor. He first thought of recommending Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) as his successor, but after the secret of Burke's tremor and cover-up came out, that plan is put to a stand-still. Nevertheless, he tells the hospital board of his retirement but has yet to name his successor; Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Preston, Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) and Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) are all eagerly clamoring for the post. Richard eventually chooses Derek, but Derek tells him that Richard should remain chief. Near the end of the third season, Adele is admitted to the hospital and is discovered to be pregnant (at 52 years old). Though he believes the father to be the man Adele insinuated to be seeing months earlier, Richard stays by Adele's side as she is treated. However, due to complications, she loses the baby. Adele later admits to Richard that the baby, which was a boy, was actually his. At the conclusion of the third season, Richard and Adele decide to give their marriage another try. At the beginning of the fourth season, Richard and Adele declare that his work is the reason that their marriage has failed and separate. He consequently moves in with his friend Derek Shepherd in his trailer home and tries to repair his life as a divorc√© for the remainder of the season until, by the end, he reasserts his good reputation to his wife and wins her back. At the start of the fifth season, Richard starts to deal with the fact that Seattle Grace's surgical program ranking has been suffering. Determined to repair his hospital's reputation, he has become determined to enforce a new tougher series of hospital rules. Adding to his new behavior, he seems to becoming more and more agitated by Meredith Grey's (Ellen Pompeo) presence in his life as she is a reminder to him of every mistake he has made over the years. Over the course of the season, he becomes resentful of his mentee in General Surgery, Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s decision to leave the General Surgery program to embark upon a fellowship in Pediatric Surgery and attempts to prevent it in any way possible; he gives her an uninspiring letter of recommendation and buys a surgical robot for General Surgery to \\"lure\\" Dr. Bailey back to the program. However, as he finally comes to terms with Dr. Bailey's choice, she confides to the Chief that her husband has left her with an ultimatum - if she takes the fellowship in Pediatrics, he will divorce her. Dr. Bailey tells the Chief that she has decided that she will leave her husband herself, but that she still cannot take the Pediatrics fellowship, because she will now be a single mother. In the sixth season he has been under a lot of stress. In the episode \\"New History\\" most of the people believe he is having an affair due to his odd decisions and mistakes lately, but it is revealed at the end of the episode that the chief has gone back to drinking again. At first, he tells Meredith, who he has taken under his wing to help out learning new skills, that he wasn't an alcoholic, but rather in a state of depression, and he promised that his eggnog at Christmas would be his last drink. However Meredith discovers him at the bar very drunk, showing that he has indeed relapsed. He was given the choice by Derek and the Board, to retire early or enter a rehab program where he would receive help for his drinking, and possibly gain his job back. Richard contemplated throwing away his career, which caused him and Derek to get in a shouting match. He later handed Derek the papers agreeing to enter Rehab. After rehab, Richard returns as a General Surgery attending and performs awake surgery on Harper Avery. On the day of shooting, he enters the hospital against police orders and convinces Gary Clarke to shoot himself. Following the shooting, Derek impulsively quits as Chief and Richard is re-instated. It appears that his wife Adele is starting to show early symptoms of Alzheimer's and he starts a diabetes clinical trial based on Ellis' diaries. When he asks Meredith to be a part of his trial, she declines and joins Derek's trial on Alzheimer's instead. Adele later receives a spot on Derek's trial. During the trial, Meredith tampers with the drugs so that Adele does not receive the placebo. After the truth is revealed which causes Meredith to lose her job, Richard takes the blame and steps down as chief of surgery to protect her, being replaced by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As Adele's condition deteriorates, Richard is forced to have her placed at Rose Ridge. Catherine Avery (Debbie Allen) comes to Seattle and develops an interest in Richard but he refuses her advances because he is a married man. However, discovering that Adele, who does not recognize him anymore, has started a relationship with a new man at Rose Ridge, he lets her go. In season 8 Richard and Catherine run into each other in the hotel where they are staying while in San Francisco to serve as examiners for the boards and have a one-night stand. However, Catherine's son Jackson (Jesse Williams), who was also there to take his boards and worked under Richard at Seattle Grace Mercy West, is horrified after finding out about the relationship. While on the way to Bailey's wedding, Richard gets a phone call alerting him that Adele has been rushed to the hospital. Bailey and Meredith perform emergency surgery, which was successful. However, it is revealed that Adele died of a heart attack while recovering in the ICU. He later embarks on a relationship with Catherine. A storm hits the hospital and creates a power outage. After operating on a former case of Bailey's, he goes in the electrical room and finds the man who was in charge of the generators lying on the ground. He sends him to an OR and stays in the room to restore the power but is seemingly electrocuted. Richard slowly recovers from his electrical injuries after putting Meredith as his POA. Richard returns to work and is given a retirement package from Hunt on his birthday. Richard accepts to become the head of the residency program mentoring the residents. He continues his relationship with Catherine and plans to propose. Richard chats with Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) after her first day at Grey Sloan Memorial who says that it was surreal to work at a place where, Ellis Grey, her birth mother, has the same name. Maggie bears a striking resemblance to Richard, suggesting that he is her father. As series 11 progresses, it is revealed through moments of flashbacks from Meredith that Maggie is in fact Richard's daughter, and that Ellis gave her up out of shame and suffering from depression. Upon finding out the truth Richard doesn't tell Maggie the news straight away out of fear Maggie will reject and blame him for giving her up. This causes Richard to act strangely around her, causing Miranda Bailey to wonder if he is sleeping with her, Richard correcting her on this mistake causes other members of staff to find out the truth before Maggie. After the truth is revealed Maggie is angry with Richard and ignores and rebuffs him for some time. Later on in the season the pair are seen to have bonded and are now friends, with Richard and Meredith sharing stories with Maggie about Ellis. In the season 13 episode \\"The Room Where It Happens,\\" when a male patient is wheeled into the OR where Meredith, Hunt, and Edwards are waiting, Webber shows up to help having napped all day. Webber wants the patient to be given a name, he picks Gail, a cello player and music teacher. During the episode, each of the doctors has a flashback to a tragic incident from their past. We learn near the end of the episode, Gail was Webber's mother, who had advanced pancreatic cancer and died when he was ten.

Addison is a world-class neonatal surgeon with board certifications in both Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Maternal and Fetal Medicine. Additionally, she is a medical genetics fellow. She works at the Oceanside Wellness Group, a fictional practice located in Santa Monica, California. Addison joined the series in the first season finale as Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey)'s estranged wife. Initially set for a recurring guest stint on Grey's, Walsh's character expanded into a series regular position as Rhimes grew fond of Walsh's portrayal of the character. Once the love-triangle storyline had been resolved, Rhimes created a spin-off based on the character, Private Practice which saw Addison move to Los Angeles to start anew, after two seasons as a series regular. The spin-off lasted six seasons, with Walsh deciding to retire the character after eight years of portraying her.  Storylines  = Backstory = Most of Addison's past is presented in a non-linear fashion, primarily revealed in the second season of Grey's Anatomy and the second and third season of Private Practice. Addison is the daughter of wealthy parents and has a $25 million trust fund. Addison's father is nicknamed \\"The Captain\\" and is a doctor who teaches medicine at a university where Addison would sit and watch as a child. Her father used spending time with his daughter as a pretense for his many affairs. Addison's mother is Beatrice \\"Bizzy\\" Forbes Montgomery and her brother, Archer, is a world-class neurologist and successful author. Addison met her future husband, Derek Shepherd, in medical school. Addison is a Yale University graduate and attended Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City for medical school. She met future colleagues Sam and Naomi Bennett there as well. Addison and Derek each began their practice in New York City, which placed a strain on their marriage. Their marriage was troubled in the years leading to Derek's decision to leave New York as it is eventually revealed in both Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice that Derek's mother did not approve of her (choosing to give her dead husband's ring to Derek's second wife, Meredith Grey) and Addison's brother Archer disliked Derek. Derek later admitted that he was at fault as he was an absent husband. Addison's affair with Derek's best friend Mark Sloan drove the wedge even further and Derek's departure to Seattle. Addison briefly attempted to have a relationship with Mark, which resulted in her becoming pregnant. She had an abortion as she was still in love with Derek, and when Mark cheated on her, she moved to Seattle. = Grey's Anatomy = The character Addison first appears in the season one finale of Grey's Anatomy, arriving at Richard's behest. She tries to reconcile with Derek, despite his relationship with Meredith Grey, but he is still angry with her, and there is a period of antagonism between them. Addison's presence, however, does reinvigorate their relationship, and ultimately leads to Derek choosing Addison over Meredith, despite Derek eventually admitting that he fell in love with Meredith. They attempt to return to their former life, taking residence in his trailer, and Addison becomes the head of a unique surgical service integrating neonatal surgery and obstetrics and gynecology. She realizes that Derek still has feelings for Meredith, and their marriage is tested further when Mark arrives in Seattle looking for Addison. Mark makes Addison realize that Derek is in love with Meredith and that he (Mark) does love her. Derek sleeps with Addison after he sees that Meredith has moved on. When Addison finds out that Derek had sex with Meredith, she gets drunk and sleeps with Mark. He asks for a relationship, but she rejects him. During season two, Addison punishes Alex Karev, by putting him on her service, because he almost got her arrested. However, by season three, she begins to feel an attraction towards Alex and eventually sleeps with him, only to discover that he is not interested in a relationship with her. Feeling alone, Addison decides to have a baby and visits Naomi, who is a fertility specialist. This storyline introduces Addison's transition from Grey's Anatomy to its spin-off, as it serves as the backdoor pilot for Private Practice. Soon after, Addison decides to leave Seattle and move to Los Angeles, joining Oceanside Wellness, led by Sam and Naomi. This marks Addison's departure from Grey's Anatomy as a regular, although she makes later guest appearances. = Private Practice = In the series' first episode, Addison is made to feel unwelcome by the other doctors but stays. Addison is attracted to Pete Wilder, the practice's alternative medicine specialist. When Pete stands her up on a date, Addison decides they should be friends and nothing more and instead accepts a date with Kevin, a police officer she met through work. In a crossover episode, Addison briefly returns to Seattle Grace to help with a patient. Before she leaves, Addison advises Meredith not to let Derek get away. In season two, Addison learns from Naomi that the practice is failing financially. She tells Sam against Naomi's wishes, and, feeling betrayed, Naomi breaks off her friendship with Addison. Addison inadvertently prompts the staff to vote between Sam and Naomi and is surprised when instead, she is elected to lead the practice as its director. Addison's relationship with Kevin is tested when her brother Archer tells Kevin he is not good enough for her. Addison reassures him, but it causes them to break up later. Addison is surprised when Archer begins working for Pacific Wellcare Center, a rival practice. When he experiences multiple seizures and believes he has a brain tumor, Addison asks Derek to treat Archer in another crossover episode with Grey's Anatomy. Derek discovers he has parasites in his brain, and successfully removes them. Naomi and Archer begin dating, which puts some strain on the friendship between Addison and Naomi. Addison also dates a man who is later revealed to be married. Also during this time, it is shown that Addison's mother Bizzy is a lesbian who has been in a long term affair with her best friend. Addison is angry because she always blamed her father for his numerous extra-marital affairs and was angry at how he treated Bizzy, not realizing that her mother was the one in a serious extramarital relationship. Addison's father is aware of her mother's affair, but they decided a long time ago that they would stay married to one another because Bizzy is not comfortable with others knowing about her sexuality. Although the relationship with her parents is strained from this, in the end, they make peace. Addison and Sam start developing feelings for each other. It is revealed that, back in college, Sam wanted to ask Addison out but was too nervous, and he ended up with Naomi. They shared a kiss after a terrifying ordeal when they tried to save a married couple who got into a devastating car accident. They kiss again when Addison decides to sleep over at Sam's. Addison and Sam grow close, but she chooses to put a halt on their developing relationship, worried about the consequences in her friendship with Naomi. Addison revealed that she was in love with Sam and Pete, but she decided to begin a relationship with Pete instead, while Sam was with another doctor. Despite them being with other people, they still show they harbor feelings for each other, including jealousy when they see the other with their current significant others. After Sam becomes single again, he kisses Addison again. Although she was with Pete, she kisses Sam back and Pete catches them. Despite this, they stay together. Naomi ends her friendship with Addison after she finds about Sam and Addison. In the season finale, Addison has to operate on Maya Bennett, her godchild, who got in a car accident on her way to the hospital to give birth. She and Naomi then make up. Addison breaks up with Pete, and she and Sam finally become a couple. Although Addison wants to have children, Sam tells her he's not ready to have more children, as he wants to take time in their romance. Sam and Addison end their relationship and Addison goes on a date with a man named Jake (played by Benjamin Bratt). He invites her to Fiji, and although she initially agrees, in the end she chooses to get back together with Sam. At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final two seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to having feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true, and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.Netflix.com In the beginning of season 6, we find that Addison rejected Sam and is now pursuing a relationship with Jake. Jake and Addison move in together later in the season after she admits to being in love with him. She then proposes marriage. Although initially, he does not give her an answer, over the course of the episode he gains closure with his wife and realizes that Addison is who he wants to spend his life with. When Addison gets home, Jake has lit candles and lined the living room with rose petals, leading to the deck where he is waiting for her in a suit and tie. He tells her to ask him again, and gives her a ring, after which point the two are engaged. In the final episode of Private Practice, Jake and Addison get married and are beginning the rest of their lives with Henry.  Development  = Casting and creation = Kate Walsh first appeared as Addison on Grey's Anatomy. The character was initially planned to appear in several episodes but quickly became a regular on the show before leaving for Private Practice. In June 2012, Kate Walsh announced on Bethenny that the upcoming sixth season of Private Practice would be her last one. \\"It's been an incredible journey and an amazing ride and I'm hugely, hugely grateful. It's bittersweet. It's a huge chapter of my life. It's been eight years,\\" she said. = Characterization = Montgomery was initially described as \\"cold and unforgiving\\". As episodes passed, it was noted that the writers had \\"softened\\" the character. Walsh summarized her as \\"a girl you love to hate\\". She said of Montgomery's transition from the end of Grey's Anatomy first season to the second: \\"She started out so together. Now she's a cat without a whisker ‚Äî a little off balance and leaving a mess all over the hospital. She's a little untethered now, she's coming unraveled.\\" Walsh felt that Montgomery had become \\"stronger\\" and \\"more centered\\" between the first and the second season of Private Practice, \\"Initially she's still getting her footing, still isn't quite sure and a little wobbly, and then you see that she's got her groove back.\\" Additionally, Walsh said of the character that \\"she's flawed and arrogant and really good at what she does. And no matter what happens, she picks herself up and moves on. She keeps trying.\\" Walsh expressed satisfaction with the evolution of Montgomery's love life because \\"the only thing we saw of her in Grey's Anatomy was the ugly side of the Derek/Meredith triangle. And then, of course, Mark Sloan, but there was no real love there.\\" She said the pairing of her character with Kevin Nelson (David Sutcliffe) is different than from what transpires with Pete Wilder (Tim Daly) or Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey); \\"It's really fun to see this total other side of her come out that we never saw. It hit me, this little epiphany of like, 'Oh, we've never seen Addison into someone or someone that likes her back.'\\"  Reception  TV Guide said of Walsh's stint on Grey's Anatomy: \\"Kate Walsh kicks butt as Addison, and I hope she sticks around. She adds spice to an already hot show.\\" Joel Keller of AOL TV was disappointed with the character's evolution from Grey's Anatomy to Private Practice during its first season, saying she \\"went from strong and funny to whimpering and lovelorn.\\" Keller was, however, happy to observe some maturity in the second season's storylines and that what he liked about her, \\"the ability to perform complicated surgical procedures even while everything in her personal life is in chaos\\", was reintroduced. By the time Private Practice ended, Margaret Lyons of New York Magazine deemed the character \\"fun\\" and added: \\"Even when tragedy befell her at every turn on PP, she was still sort of sassy and bright and interesting.\\" Montgomery appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters. Glamour named her one of the 12 Most Stylish TV Characters. She was listed in Wetpaint's \\"10 Hottest Female Doctors on TV\\" and in BuzzFeed's \\"16 Hottest Doctors On Television\\". In 2006, Walsh was among the cast of Grey's Anatomy to win the Satellite Award for Best Ensemble in a Television Series. The cast, including her, was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, which they won in 2007, and were nominated for again the following year. For her work on Private Practice, Walsh earned a nomination for Favorite TV Drama Actress at the 37th People's Choice Awards.

The two office towers in the complex are now separately owned and named ATB Place Tower and TELUShouse. The towers serve as the headquarters of ATB Financial and the main provincial offices for Telus, respectively. The south tower, TELUS House (formerly TELUS Plaza South, and originally the AGT Tower (Alberta Government Telephones Tower)), was completed in 1971, at a cost of C$22 million. It was Edmonton's tallest building until Manulife Place was completed in 1981. It is 134.4 metres (34 storeys) tall. For many years the 33rd floor was home to Vista 33, a telephone and telecommunications museum. There was also an observation deck which afforded panoramic views of Edmonton from what was then the city's tallest building. Vista 33 was closed in 1993. ATB Tower is 90 metres tall (26 storeys, 296 feet) and was completed in 1969. It contains retail space at the ground level and via Edmonton Pedway system to the Edmonton LRT in the concourse of ATB Place. The concourse courtyard was added after TELUS moved in and renovated it. It opened as McCauley Plaza, named after the first mayor of Edmonton, in which a bronze bust was displayed. The location was later renamed TELUS Plaza. After the name change to ATB Place, the bust was removed from public viewing. A third building, the two storey ATB Place annex, is located at the southeast corner of the complex. Originally the home of the (now defunct) Edmonton Club, later the main office of an engineering firm, it is currently occupied by a career college. Prior to the construction of the AGT buildings, this site was the home of the main branch of the Edmonton Public Library, which stood there from 1923 to 1969.Photo Collections  Edmonton Public Library See also *List of tallest buildings in Edmonton References External links *ATB Place Triovest profile *South Emporis profile Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1972 Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Canada Category:Skyscrapers in Edmonton Category:Twin towers Category:Telus ATB ","title":"ATB Place"},{"id":"7687050","text":"is a manga written by Rie Takada, creator of Happy Hustle High.

A coffeehouse in Damascus. Coffee culture is the set of traditions and social behaviors that surround the consumption of coffee, particularly as a social lubricant. The term also refers to the cultural diffusion and adoption of coffee as a widely consumed stimulant. In the late 20th century, espresso became an increasingly dominant drink contributing to coffee culture, particularly in the Western world and other urbanized centers around the globe. The culture surrounding coffee and coffeehouses dates back to 16th century Turkey. Coffeehouses in Western Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean were not only social hubs but also artistic and intellectual centres. Les Deux Magots in Paris, now a popular tourist attraction, was once associated with the intellectuals Jean- Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. In the late 17th and 18th centuries, coffeehouses in London became popular meeting places for artists, writers, and socialites, as well as centres for political and commercial activity. Elements of modern coffeehouses include slow-paced gourmet service, alternative brewing techniques, and inviting decor. In the United States, coffee culture is often used to describe the ubiquitous presence of espresso stands and coffee shops in metropolitan areas, along with the spread of massive, international franchises such as Starbucks. Many coffee shops offer access to free wireless internet for customers, encouraging business or personal work at these locations. Coffee culture varies by country, state, and city. For example, the strength of existing caf√©-style coffee culture in Australia explains Starbucks's negative impact on the continent. In urban centres around the world, it is not unusual to see several espresso shops and stands within walking distance of one another, or on opposite corners of the same intersection. The term coffee culture is also used in popular business media to describe the deep impact of the market penetration of coffee-serving establishments. Coffeehouses Working on a laptop at a caf√©/coffee house A coffeehouse or caf√© is an establishment that primarily serves coffee, as well as other beverages. Historically, caf√©s have been important social gathering places in Europe, and continue to be venues of social interaction today. During the 16th century, coffeehouses were temporarily banned in Mecca due to a fear that they attracted political uprising. In 2016, Albania surpassed Spain as the country with the most coffeehouses per capita in the world. In fact, there are 654 coffeehouses per 100,000 inhabitants in Albania; a country with only 2.5 million inhabitants. Caf√© culture in China has multiplied over the years: Shanghai alone has an estimated 6,500 coffeehouses, including small chains and larger corporations like Starbucks. In addition to coffee, many caf√©s also serve tea, sandwiches, pastries, and other light refreshments. Some caf√©s provide other services, such as wired or wireless internet access (the name, internet caf√©, has carried over to stores that provide internet service without any coffee) for their customers. This has also spread to a type of caf√© known as the LAN Caf√©, which allows users to have access to computers that already have computer games installed. Social aspects New York Les Deux Magots in Paris, once a famous haunt of French intellectuals A coffee caf√® in Melbourne. Many social aspects of coffee can be seen in the modern-day lifestyle. By absolute volume, the United States is the largest market for coffee, followed by Germany and Japan. Canada, Australia, Sweden and New Zealand are also large coffee-consuming countries. The Nordic countries consume the most coffee per capita, with Finland typically occupying the top spot with a per-capita consumption of 12 kg per year, followed by Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and Sweden. Consumption has vastly increased in recent years in the traditionally tea-drinking United Kingdom, but is still below 5 kg per person per year as of 2005. Turkish coffee is popular in Turkey, the Eastern Mediterranean, and southeastern Europe. Coffeehouse culture had a strong cultural penetration in much of the former Ottoman Empire, where Turkish coffee remains the dominant style of preparation. The coffee enjoyed in the Ottoman Middle East was produced in Yemen/Ethiopia, despite multiple attempts to ban the substance for its stimulating qualities. By 1600, coffee and coffeehouses were a prominent feature of Ottoman life. There are various scholarly perspectives on the functions of the Ottoman coffeehouse. Many of these argue that Ottoman coffeehouses were centres of important social ritual, making them as, or more important than, the coffee itself. \\"At the start of the modern age, the coffeehouses were places for renegotiating the social hierarchy and for challenging the social order\\". Coffee has been important in Austrian and French culture since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Vienna's coffeehouses are prominent in Viennese culture and known internationally, while Paris was instrumental in the development of \\"caf√© society\\" in the first half of the 20th century. In France, coffee consumption is often viewed as a social activity and exists largely within the caf√© culture. Espresso based drinks, including but not limited to caf√© au lait and caff√® crema, are most popular within modern French coffee culture. Notably in Northern Europe, coffee parties are a popular form of entertainment. The host or hostess of the coffee party also serves cake and pastries, which are sometimes homemade. In Germany, Netherlands, Austria, and the Nordic countries, strong black coffee is also regularly consumed during or immediately after main meals such as lunch and dinner and several times a day at work or school. In these countries, especially Germany and Sweden, restaurants and caf√©s will often provide free refills of black coffee, especially if customers purchase a sweet treat or pastry with their drink. In the United States, coffee shops are typically used as meeting spots for business, and are frequented as dating spots for young adults. Coffee has played a large role in history and literature because of the effects of the industry on cultures where it is produced and consumed. Coffee is often regarded as one of the primary economic goods used in imperial control of trade. The colonised trade patterns in goods, such as slaves, coffee, and sugar, defined Brazilian trade for centuries. Coffee in culture or trade is a central theme and prominently referenced in poetry, fiction, and regional history. Coffee utensils * Coffee grinder * Coffee pot, for brewing with hot water, made of glass or metal * Coffeemaker * Coffee cup, for drinking coffee, usually smaller than a teacup in North America and Europe *Saucer placed under the coffee cup * Coffee spoon, usually small and used for stirring the coffee in the cup * Coffee service tray, to place the coffee utensils on and to keep the hot water from spilling onto the table * Coffee canister, usually airtight, for storing coffee * Water kettle, or coffee kettle, for heating the water *Sugar bowl, for granular sugar or sugar lumps or cubes * Cream pitcher or jug, also called a creamer, for fresh milk or cream Coffee break Coffee break in Belgrade, Serbia. A coffee break is a routine social gathering for a snack or short downtime by employees in various work industries. Allegedly originating in the late 19th century by the wives of Norwegian immigrants, in Stoughton, Wisconsin, it is celebrated there every year with the Stoughton Coffee Break Festival. In 1951, Time Magazine noted that \\"since the war, the coffee break has been written into union contracts\\". The term subsequently became popular through a 1952 ad campaign of the Pan- American Coffee Bureau which urged consumers to \\"give yourself a Coffee-Break -- and Get What Coffee Gives to You.\\" John B. Watson, a behavioural psychologist who worked with Maxwell House later in his career, helped popularise coffee breaks within American culture. By country =Albania= Caf√©s in central Tirana in 2017 In 2016, Albania surpassed Spain by becoming the country with the most coffeehouses per capita in the world. There are 654 coffeehouses per 100,000 inhabitants in Albania, a country with only 2.5 million inhabitants. This is due to coffeehouses closing down in Spain because of the economic crisis, whereas Albania had an equal amount of caf√©s opening and closing. Also, the fact that it is one of the easiest ways to make a living after the fall of communism in Albania, together with the country's Ottoman legacy, further reinforces the strong dominance of the nation's coffee culture. =Esperantujo= Viennese Coffeehouse In Esperanto culture, a gufujo (plural gufujoj) is a non-alcoholic, non-smoking, makeshift European- style caf√© that opens in the evening. Esperanto speakers meet at a specified location, either a rented space or someone's house, and enjoy live music or readings with tea, coffee, pastries, etc. There may be a cash payment required as expected in an actual caf√©. It is a calm atmosphere in direct contrast to the wild parties that other Esperanto speakers might be having elsewhere. Gufujoj were originally intended for people who dislike crowds, loud noise and partying. =Italy= In Italy, locals drink coffee at the counter, as opposed to taking it to-go. Italians serve espresso as the default coffee, don't flavor espresso, and traditionally never drink cappuccinos after 11 a.m. In fact, dairy-based espresso drinks are usually only enjoyed in the morning. The oldest cafe in Italy is Caffe Florian in Venice. = Japan = In 1888, the first coffeehouse opened in Japan, known as Kahiichakan. Kahiichakan means a caf√© that provides coffee and tea. In the 1970s, many kissaten (coffee-tea shop) appeared around the Tokyo area such as Shinjuku, Ginza, and in the popular student areas such as Kanda. These kissaten were centralized in estate areas around railway stations with around 200 stores in Shinjuku alone. Globalization made the coffee chain stores start appearing in the 1980s. In 1982, the All Japan Coffee Association (AJCA) stated that there were 162,000 stores in Japan. The import volume doubled from 1970 to 1980 from 89,456 to 194,294 tons. =Sweden= Family in S√∂derhamn, Sweden seated for fika around 1916. Swedes have fika (), often with pastries, although coffee can be substituted with tea, juice, lemonade, hot chocolate, or squash for children. The tradition has spread throughout Swedish businesses around the world. Fika is a social institution in Sweden and the practice of taking a break with a beverage and snack is widely accepted as central to Swedish life. As a common mid-morning and mid-afternoon practice at workplaces in Sweden, fika may also function partially as an informal meeting between co-workers and management people, and it may even be considered impolite not to join in.Paulsen, Roland (2014) Empty Labor: Idleness and Workplace Resistance. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. ; p. 90 Fika often takes place in a meeting room or a designated fika room. A sandwich, fruit or a small meal may be called fika as the English concept of afternoon tea. = Hong Kong = In the 1920s, mostly wealthy people or those with higher socioeconomic status could afford to drink coffee whereas ordinary people were rarely able to afford the drink, which was more expensive than traditional beverages. Yuenyeung (coffee with tea) was invented in Hong Kong in 1936.  Education and research  An American college course entitled \\"Design of Coffee\\" is part of the chemical engineering curriculum at University of California, Davis. A research facility devoted to coffee research was under development on the UC Davis campus in early 2017.  In media  Coffee culture frequently appears in comics, television, and film in varied ways. The comic strips Adam and Pearls Before Swine frequently centre the strip around visiting or working at coffee shops. TV shows such as NCIS frequently show characters with espresso in hand or distributing to-go cups to other characters. In the TV show Friends, the main cast gathers at the fictional coffee shop Central Perk in nearly every episode. Gilmore Girls, a popular show from the early 2000s, depicts the central characters Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Rory frequently referencing their need for coffee, as well as enjoying coffee at their local diner, Lukes. In the NBC series Frasier, the characters are often seen drinking coffee at the fictional Caf√© Nervosa, which is said to have been inspired by the real-life Elliott Bay Caf√© in Seattle.

Jedaiah led the second of the 24 priestly divisions. The biblical passage of 1 Chronicles 24 documents the division of the priests during the reign of King David. These priests were all descendants of Aaron, who had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. However, Nadab and Abihu died before Aaron and only Eleazar and Ithamar had sons. One priest, Zadok, from Eleazar's descendants and another priest, Ahimelech, from Ithamar's descendants were designated to help create the various priestly orders. Sixteen of Eleazar's descendants were selected to head priestly orders while only eight of Ithamar's descendants were so chosen. The passage states that this was done because of the greater number of leaders among Eleazar's descendants. Lots were drawn to designate the order of ministering for the heads of the priestly orders when they entered the temple. Since each order was responsible for ministering during a different week, Jedaiah's order was stationed as a watch at the Tabernacle during the second week of the year on the Hebrew calendar. The descendants of Jedaiah were regarded as one of the \\"families of Israel.\\" Another priest named Jedaiah, presumably a descendant, is also named in a genealogy at 1 Chronicles 9:10. Jedaiah, son of Joiarib is mentioned in Nehemiah 11:10 among those who settled in Jerusalem and two priests named Jedaiah are listed in Nehemiah 12:6-7 among the priests who returned from the Babylonian exile.

The public was not amused at a clergyman's being made the subject of ridicule, and the opera was regarded by some as scandalous. An 1892 revival at the Savoy Theatre was more successful, lasting for 143 performances, after public perceptions had changed.Rollins and Witts, p. 13 The opera is based on the character described in a satirical 18th-century English folk song \\"The Vicar of Bray\\", as well as on The History of Sandford and Merton, a series of 18th century moral tales. In the parlour song, the eponymous vicar was the clergyman of the parish of Bray-on-Thames, Berkshire. The most familiar version of the lyrics recounts his adaptability (some would say amorality) over half a century, from the reigns of Charles II to George I. Over this period he embraced whichever form of liturgy, Protestant or Catholic, that was favoured by the monarch of the day to retain his position as vicar of Bray. See the annotated lyrics to \\"The Vicar of Bray\\". The earliest version of the song's lyrics may have been written by \\"an officer in Colonel Fuller's regiment,\\" according to one source. The lyrics exist in various forms. However, the story of the vicar's cheerful reversals of principle remains the same in all circumstances. In the opera, the vicar switches between \\"High\\" and \\"Low\\" Church, that is, from ritualistic Anglo- Catholic ceremonies to austere evangelical forms of worship. Original production The premi√®re was moderately well received by the press. Reynolds's Newspaper said, \\"The music is light and tuneful, the plot is clever, and the dialogue can boast to be of the Gilbertian order of writing.\\"Reynolds's Newspaper, 23 July 1882, p. 8 The influential theatrical newspaper The Era found the plot \\"singularly deficient\\" in interest, but praised \\"the smartness of the dialogue\\" and the \\"easy and fluent\\" music, though judging it as having \\"but little originality.\\"The Era, 29 July 1882, p. 6 The Manchester Guardian reported, \\"The entire work is a close imitation of Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan's method. This is to be regretted, for the peculiar humour of The Sorcerer and Patience cannot be successfully copied.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 24 July 1882, p. 5 The cast, including W. J. Hill, Walter H. Fisher and W. S. Penley, received generally excellent notices. The work was produced in New York in October 1882, under Solomon's direction, but was a failure.The Era, 21 October 1882, p. 4 1892 Savoy Theatre revival Rutland Barrington as the Vicar and Mary Duggan as Nelly Bly When the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership disbanded after the production of The Gondoliers in 1889, impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte was forced to find new works to present at the Savoy Theatre. Solomon's The Nautch Girl was the first non-Gilbert and Sullivan \\"Savoy Opera\\" in 1891. Sullivan was writing a new opera for the Savoy that would become Haddon Hall, but this was delayed because of Sullivan's ill health. In the meantime, when The Nautch Girl closed after a modestly successful run, Carte revived The Vicar of Bray at the Savoy in 1892. During the decade since the piece had been first presented, the public had come to accept clergymen as comic characters. As The Times wrote, \\"The run of [Grundy's] The Private Secretary changed the views even of the most serious playgoers, and it may be remarked in passing that the clerical functions of the Rev. Robert Spalding were judiciously kept altogether out of sight, as indeed they were in the case of [Dr. Daly in] The Sorcerer.... [The piece] was warmly received.\\"The Times, 29 January 1892, p. 3 The revival ran for a respectable 143 performances, with a cast that included Rutland Barrington, Courtice Pounds, W. H. Denny, and Rosina Brandram. The opera was then played by several D'Oyly Carte companies on provincial tours in 1893‚Äì96 and 1898‚Äì99. The title role was played by Henry Lytton in the 1893‚Äì96 tours, with Courtice Pounds repeating his role of the curate. Cox and Box was played as a curtain raiser.Rollins and Witts, pp. 25‚Äì27The Era, 18 May 1895, p. 14 Synopsis Act 1: Low Church. The Village Green. The Rev. William Barlow, the Vicar of Bray, became Low Church to marry his rich wife who, now dead, has left him with a daughter, Dorothy. Dorothy is in love with her father's curate, Henry Sandford, a priggish, pompous and verbose young man. The Vicar prefers that his daughter marry Sandford's old schoolmate, Tommy Merton, son of a wealthy local landowner. To get Sandford out of the way, the Vicar, on the advice of his family solicitor, Mr. Bedford Rowe, turns High Church. Aghast, Sandford flees to become a missionary in the Cassowary Isles. Act 2: High Church. The Vicarage Grounds. Now that the Vicar and all his students have become High Church they are doomed to celibacy, and the chorus of lady Sunday School teachers is distraught at the loss of their matrimonial prospects. So, too, is Mrs. Merton, who has had her eye on the Vicar. Tommy Merton is prepared to marry Dorothy, but suddenly Sandford, who everyone supposed was devoured by cannibals, returns as an improved man ‚Äì no longer pompous. Dorothy returns to her first love, but her father is adamant. The solicitor announces that the Vicar's High Church propensities have displeased his Bishop who has declared him defrocked, his living to be bestowed on Sandford. There is only one way out. The Vicar becomes Low Church again. He is now eligible to wed the wealthy Mrs. Merton, Sandford gets Dorothy, and Tommy goes off with the leading danseuse of the local theatre.

Among his notable posts were those commanding the Air Training Command, the Seventh Air Force during the Vietnam War, and the Tactical Air Command (TAC). During his tour in Southeast Asia, he was concurrently the deputy commander of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) for air operations and thus responsible for Operation Rolling Thunder, the air campaign against North Vietnam, which Momyer executed in the face of micromanagement from President Lyndon B. Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara.Boyne, \\"Momyer\\", pp. 64‚Äì65 Momyer was acknowledged in the Air Force community as \\"a true expert in tactical air warfare.\\" His predecessor as commander of TAC described him as difficult to work for or with because he was \\"much smarter than most people.\\" After his retirement in 1973, he spent five years researching and writing Airpower in Three Wars, his treatise on airpower doctrine, strategy, and tactics.Boyne, \\"Momyer\\", p. 68 Momyer is a controversial figure historically for an incident of racial intolerance during World War II when as a fighter group commander he recommended that the 99th Fighter Squadron, a segregated African American unit then attached to his command, be removed from combat operations. The controversy reached the highest levels of the United States Army Air Forces, was widely reported in the American press, and resulted in an official study that exculpated the \\"Tuskegee Airmen.\\" Early life Momyer was born in 1916, the son of a lawyer in Muskogee, Oklahoma. He was 14 when his father died of a heart attack and he moved with his mother to Seattle, Washington,Megan McDonough, Retired Air Force Gen. William W. Momyer dies at 95, The Washington Post (September 1, 2012). Retrieved 29 October 2013 where he attended Broadway High School and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Washington in 1937. His nickname within the service was \\"Spike\\".Boyne, \\"Momyer\\", p. 64 Momyer entered military service in 1938 as an aviation cadet in the Air Corps, and after successfully completing primary and basic pilot training at Randolph Field, moved on to the advanced training school at Kelly Field, Texas, graduating in February 1939. He received his commission as a second lieutenant and a rating of pilot, assigned to pilot and flight commander duties until February 1941, when be became military observer for air with the military attach√© in Cairo, Egypt. In this capacity, he was technical advisor to the Royal Air Force in equipping the first squadrons of the Western Desert Air Force with Curtiss Tomahawk fighters, which enabled him to fly combat missions.Boyne, \\"Momyer\\", p. 65Boyne notes that one of the units with which Momyer flew was No. 112 Squadron RAF, the first unit to paint the \\"shark's teeth\\" markings associated with P-40s on its aircraft. Service in World War II Early in 1942, at the age of 25, Momyer replaced Col. Elwood R. Quesada as commanding officer of the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk-equipped 33d Fighter Group. In October the group was carried to North Africa aboard the USS Chenango as part of Operation Torch. Launching from the aircraft carrier on November 10, the group attempted to land at the Port Lyautey airfield in French Morocco, which was still under occasional fire from French forces. Several aircraft were disabled in landing accidents and Momyer was awarded the Silver Star for personally extricating a trapped pilot from a P-40 that had flipped onto its back.Boyne, \\"Momyer\\", pp. 65‚Äì66 From Telergma Airfield, Algeria, and Thelepte Airfield, Tunisia, Momyer led the 33rd FG on combat missions in the Tunisia, Sicily and Naples-Foggia campaigns. For his performance during several combat actions of the North African campaign, he received the Distinguished Service Cross and two oak leaf clusters to his Silver Star. In North Africa, while leading his group on a ground attack against German positions near El Guettar, he single-handedly engaged 18 Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka) aircraft escorted by German and Italian fighters on 31 March 1943, and had four confirmed kills.Boyne, \\"Momyer\\", pp. 66‚Äì67 He accrued more than 200 combat flying hours and became an ace with eight credited aerial victories. During the initial campaign to evict the Axis forces from Tunisia in which the Luftwaffe had air superiority, the 33rd FG, in addition to supporting the push to the east, kept half of its operational strength in reserve in the Oran area to help 12AF guard the Strait of Gibraltar and other lines of communication from possible attack from Spain or Spanish Morocco.Mayock (1946), pp. 73 and 81Only two of its three squadrons were forward-based at Thelepte, and both of those were half-strength due to combat losses and the transfer of P-40s on 9 January 1943 to the Free French to equip the first squadron of GCII/5. (Mayock, p. 112) Because of the inadequate training and equipment of the A-20 light bomber complement of the XII Air Support Command and the tactical ineffectiveness of the French P-40 squadron attached, the burden of air support fell primarily on the understrength 33rd FG.Mayock (1946), p. 120 Thus despite cautions from Generals Jimmy Doolittle and Howard Craig to group commanders to conserve strength, Momyer was compelled to commit his aircraft to battle in small increments.Francis (1997), pp. 215‚Äì216 Curtiss P-40Fs similar to those flown by the 33rd FG in 1942‚Äì43 The priority of demands by ground force commanders for \\"umbrellas\\" (defensive air cover from attacks by Stukas) meant that other tactical missions such as close air support and escort were necessarily left to small elements, and without air superiority, attrition was high during the German offensives in central Tunisia of 18 and 30 January 1943.Mortenson (1987), p. 68 On 2 February 1943, during German attacks on Faid Pass, where the Luftwaffe had been reinforced by the remains of the Desert Luftwaffe retreating with Rommel, the group was tasked to provide both an air cover umbrella for Allied ground forces under attack by Stukas and escort for attacking U.S. bombers, losing nine aircraft.Mayock (1946), pp. 125‚Äì126 As a consequence the 33rd Fighter Group was one of four Twelfth Air Force groupsIn addition to the 33rd FG, the 14th Fighter Group (P-38s), 52nd Fighter Group (Spitfire Vs), and 319th Bomb Group (B-26s) also had to be withdrawn because of severe attrition in the month leading up to Kasserine. (Mayock, pp. 156‚Äì157) so debilitated that they were withdrawn from combat to reconstitute losses in pilots and acquisition of better aircraft.Mayock (1946), pp. 156‚Äì157, 159The \\"better equipment\\" for the 33rd FG was the P-40N variant, whose air combat capability was much closer to that of the German Bf 109 Gustav then in use in Tunisia. (Mayock, p. 159) Of the situation, Momyer himself said: Soon after, during the Battle of the Kasserine Pass, Allied tactical airpower was reorganized in North Africa with the activation on 18 February of the Northwest African Tactical Air Force (NATAF) under the command of RAF Air Marshal Arthur Coningham.The reorganization of Allied tactical airpower in North Africa was not a consequence of the Kasserine crisis but the result of decisions handed down from the Casablanca Conference a month before. The 33rd returned to combat on 22 February from Youks-les-Bains Airfield, the last forward field for the Twelfth Air Force.Mayock (1946), p. 173 Coningham, like Momyer, advocated attacks on the Luftwaffe including their airbases to achieve air superiority, which they considered essential before direct air support of ground units could be undertaken. NATAF initiated a counter-air campaign in mid-March that achieved air superiority soon after.Boyne, \\"Momyer\\", p. 66 The 33rd FG, operating from the recaptured Sbeitla Airfield, transitioned at the direction of Coningham to the role of fighter-bomber at the same time and increased its effectiveness while decreasing its losses.Craven and Cate (1949), p. 175, 181 Following the surrender of Axis forces in North Africa on 13 May, the Allied air forces immediately began a campaign of softening up the island of Pantelleria in preparation for Operation Corkscrew, the amphibious landing to seize the island scheduled for 11 June as a preliminary step in the Allied invasion of Sicily. The 33rd FG began fighter-bomber attacks on the island on 29 May, augmented by attachment to the group of the segregated 99th Fighter Squadron (known unofficially as the \\"Tuskegee Airmen\\"), which flew its first combat mission on 2 June.Haulman, \\"Chronology\\", p. 8The 99th FS was a separate squadron unassigned to any group until May 1944. It was assigned directly to XII Air Support Command and temporarily attached to groups for its combat missions. The 99th was twice attached to the 33d FG, in May‚ÄìJune and August‚ÄìOctober 1943. Following the surrender of Pantelleria on 11 June, the 33rd FG maintained patrols over the island and Allied shipping until 26 June, when it moved to the island's airfield to begin attacks on Sicily, invaded in July. The 99th FS was then sent to another group.Craven and Cate (1949), p. 427, 430‚Äì431 =Racial controversy= In September 1943, after the 99th was again attached to his group, Momyer recommended in a memo to Major General Edwin J. House, commanding XII Air Support Command, that it be removed from operations and assigned coastal patrol duties in P-39 Airacobras, alleging that it was ineffective in combat because \\"(in) my opinion... they have failed to display the aggressiveness and desire for combat that are necessary to a first-class fighting organization. It may be expected that we will get less work and less operational time out of the 99th than any squadron in this group.\\"Francis (1997), p. 89 One source claimed that Momyer had blamed the squadron for seeing little air-to-air combat while ignoring both their being awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation and that he had personally ordered them into a ground attack role.Bucholz (2007), pp. 24‚Äì25The 99th FS earned this Distinguished Unit Citation while attached to the 324th Fighter Group and it had not yet been awarded for Momyer to \\"ignore.\\" House forwarded his own memo with a similar recommendation to NAAF Deputy Commander Major General John K. Cannon based partly on Momyer's report, and within four days the memo went up the chain of command to Headquarters AAF in Washington D.C.Haulman, \\"Chronology\\", p. 13 Reports in the press that the AAF was considering downgrading the combat role of the 99th FS, partly based on Momyer's assessment, were followed in October by a review conducted by the War Department‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies, after House's report reached it, in which Colonel Benjamin O. Davis Jr. refuted the allegations and defended his former command. The 99th Fighter Squadron continued in combat, although with different groups, and by July,1944 was reassigned to the African-American 332nd Fighter Group which consisted of the 100th, 301st, and 302nd fighter squadrons.Haulman, \\"Chronology\\", p. 14 An official study was then undertaken to compare the 99th's performance with that of other P-40 units operating in the Mediterranean and reported on 30 March 1944 that the 99th had performed as well as the other Warhawk outfits.Haulman, \\"Misconceptions\\", p. 4The study was conducted by the AAF's Statistical Control Division, Office of Management Control, and examined operations between 3 July 1943 and 31 January 1944. (Haulman \\"Chronology\\", p. 19) Historian Walter J. Boyne wrote: \\"Momyer's illustrious combat record was tarnished by (the) incident of racial intolerance... at a time when such attitudes were still pervasive... Momyer's assessment was wrong.\\"Boyne, \\"Momyer\\", p. 67 Momyer was replaced in command of the 33rd FG in October 1943,33d Operations Group Fact Sheet , AFHRA. Retrieved 26 October 2013. and did not have another combat command during the remainder of the war.Momyer was replaced in command of the 33rd FG on the same date that the 99th FS was attached to the 79th Fighter Group in Italy, and the day after Davis defended his squadron's performance to a War Department inquiry. (Haulman \\"Chronology\\", p. 14) He returned to the United States in 1944 to become chief of the Combined Operations Branch of the Army Air Forces Board, with the mission of devising doctrine for cooperation of air, land, and sea forces in combat operations. From his work came AAF (and later USAF) doctrine that after the first priority of achieving air superiority was successful, the next priority for airpower was isolating an enemy‚Äôs forward forces by destroying his forces in the rear. Post World War II and USAF career Lt. Gen William W. Momyer as Commander, Air Training Command He became the Assistant Chief of Staff (A-5) for Tactical Air Command in 1946 during the formation of TAC headquarters, and continued serving with TAC until he entered the Air War College in 1949. Upon graduation from the Air War College in 1950 he became a member of the faculty. He attended the U.S. Army War College in 1953‚Äì1954 and then went to the Republic of Korea where he commanded the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing. With the redeployment of units from Korea to Japan, the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing moved to Itazuke Air Base. In March 1955 Momyer returned to Korea to establish the 314th Air Division and command all U.S. Air Force units there. Returning to the United States in October 1955, he assumed command of the 312th Fighter-Bomber Wing at Clovis Air Force Base, New Mexico, (subsequently renamed Cannon Air Force Base). Momyer assumed command of the 832d Air Division, Cannon Air Force Base, in May 1957. As commander of the two F-100D Super Sabre fighter wings, he had the distinction of commanding the first units to take top honors for both conventional and special weapons teams during the U.S. Air Force Fighter Weapons Meet at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. Momyer was director of plans, Headquarters TAC, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, from July 1958 to October 1961. He was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force from October 1961 to February 1964 as director of operational requirements, and during the period of February‚ÄìAugust 1964, as assistant deputy chief of staff, programs and requirements. Of this period in his career, Boyne writes: \\"Characteristically, he continued to do as much work as possible himself, earning fame for his reading speed and total recall. This performance masked an important shortfall, though: By failing to use his deputies effectively, he also failed to train a next generation to replace him.\\" Vietnam era commands In August 1964 Momyer became commander of the Air Training Command and held that post until July 1966, when he went to Vietnam to serve as Deputy Commander for Air Operations, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), and concurrently, Commander, Seventh Air Force. He served in this important dual role until August 1968, at which time he assumed command of Tactical Air Command. During Momyer's tour in Southeast Asia, he was a vigorous exponent of an all-jet air force, believing that jet fighter-bombers could outperform the often more accurate but slower (and thus more vulnerable) propeller-driven strike aircraft such as A-1 Skyraiders and T-28 Trojans.Tilford (2009), p. 76 Momyer has been subject to criticisms for his relationship to subordinates and insistence on implementation of his own views. Brigadier General Chuck Yeager, in his autobiography, related that in early 1968 he had been assigned as prospective commander of the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing, a unit at Phan Rang Air Base in Vietnam. While he was awaiting orders, Yeager was advised that Momyer had rejected him because as Seventh Air Force commander, he was entitled to select his own wing commanders and had not been consulted about the assignment. This resulted in Yeager being forced on Momyer by General John D. Ryan, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) commander and a Yeager admirer. Although Momyer prevailed in the subsequent political tug of war, the controversy resulted in Momyer's lasting enmity towards Yeager, whom he had never met, for reasons that Yeager was unable to discern.Yeager (1985), pp. 298‚Äì299 Later that year Momyer became commander of TAC, in which Yeager was now a wing commander, culminating in early 1969 in a showdown in which Momyer purportedly threatened to terminate Yeager's command and possibly career. Yeager instead was promoted to brigadier general when the promotion board requested that Yeager be added to its selection choices after Momyer did not include him as one of his TAC recommendations.Yeager (1985), pp. 303‚Äì305 Boyne stated: \\"(Momyer) brushed off subordinates‚Äô opinions even though he often questioned his superiors‚Äô views when they differed from his own.\\" However, he supported Colonel Jack Broughton in his lobbying of higher echelons to have planning of air missions against North Vietnam determined by local commanders instead of being dictated by the White House, although Momyer later withheld award of decorations earned by Broughton when Ryan, one of the higher echelons opposing the lobbying, made known his intense dislike of Broughton. Momyer also notably brought Colonel Robin Olds to the Seventh Air Force, despite a personal animus, to reduce loss rates in the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing,Sherwood (1999), pp. 27‚Äì28 and implemented the tactical initiative Operation Bolo proposed by Olds even while expressing personal disapproval of Olds' public persona. Momyer retired from the Air Force on September 30, 1973. He and his wife, Marguerite Willson Momyer, were married 69 years until her death in 2004. He died from heart failure on August 10, 2012 at an assisted living center in Merritt Island, Florida, aged 95.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 19 January 2019 Smith was ordained in Rome as a priest in 1592. He obtained his doctorate in theology at the English College, Valladolid, where he also taught philosophy. In 1598 became a professor of controversies at the English College of St Gregory in Seville. In 1603 he went on the English mission at a time when Catholicism was officially banned, and could have faced death if caught and tried. He was well known at the Holy See, not only as a student, but as an agent on behalf of the English clergy.Flanagan, Thomas. History of the Church in England, vol. II, 1857, p. 309 He served as chaplain to Viscountess Montague, wife of Anthony- Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu, at Battle Abbey in Sussex, England. Smith left Sussex in 1613 he became superior of the small body of English secular priests who had rented the Benedictine house in Paris called Arras College, where they devoted themselves to writing controversy. Vicar apostolic In Paris, in January 1625, Smith was consecrated Titular bishop of Chalcedon. and Apostolic Vicar for the whole of England, Wales and Scotland in 1625. He followed William Bishop, who had held the post for less than a year. He arrived in England in April 1625, and stayed in Turvey, Bedfordshire, at the house of Lord Montagu. Unlike his predecessor, Smith claimed authority over Scotland, and asserted that no priest sent to England should exercise their faculties unless approved by him. He created new vicars and archdeacons, and issued a regulation that none of the regular clergy (i.e., priests belonging to religious orders) could hear confessions unless he was approved by Smith. His order that the laity should receive his ministers and officials put them in jeopardy of arrest. Smith had also managed to antagonize the Catholic nobles by arbitrarily assigning confessors, and threatening to make Lord Morley return to live with his wife. The disputes had become so contentious that his residence in London became known and in 1628 a warrant was issued for his arrest. In March 1629, a reward of 100‚Ç§ was offered for his capture.

At a dinner during Lent, King Charles encouraged his pregnant wife to eat some meat, which the queen was reluctant to do without ecclesiastical permission. Whereupon the king turned to the ambassador and requested that he quickly send a servant to obtain the said permission, adding that he knew full well he would find the bishop there. In the meantime, the Pope had the French nuncio remind Smith that he had been consecrated Bishop of Calcedon, not of England, and that his ordinary powers were both limited and revocable, that missionaries sent by the Holy See did not require his approval, and that he should work better with them. Upon receiving the brief through the Queen's chaplain, Smith decided that his position as Apostolic Vicar was untenable and went to France. His resignation was quickly accepted, and although he attempted to rescind it, he was forbidden to return to England Death In Paris Smith lived at first with Cardinal Richelieu until the latter's death in 1642. He held the title of commendatory abbot of Charroux Abbey, resigning that title in 1648.

Learning French is like any other task, it can be difficult at first, but eventually, it becomes subconscious. The earlier the student can be exposed to it, the easier it will be grasped. Students that are in French Immersion schools complete the same curriculum subjects as other schools but have the advantage of learning a new language. The French Immersion program was designed to take benefit of children's capacity to learn freely and smoothly. Also, take advantage of their communicative competence and open perspectives on language and society. Therefore, learning French becomes unconscious, and there is a heavy focus on understanding before pronouncing.

The 151st episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 1, 2006. The episode is the first in a two-part story arc, which concludes with \\"Go God Go XII\\". In \\"Go God Go\\", Cartman is unable to wait the three weeks until the Wii video game console is released, and attempts to freeze himself to get closer to the release date, but accidentally ends up much later in the future, in the atheistic world of 2546. Meanwhile, Ms. Garrison is forced to teach evolution to her students. The episode was written and directed by South Park co-creator Trey Parker. The episode is a satire on atheism and mocks evolutionist Richard Dawkins, as well some arguments against religion. Plot Cartman is unable to wait three weeks until the Nintendo Wii console is released. In an attempt to enter cryonic suspension, he buries himself in the snow at the top of Mount Elbert, with help from Butters. Concurrently, Mrs. Garrison resists being forced to teach the school's evolution curriculum. In response, the school hires evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins to present the evolution lesson. After some initial friction between the creationist Garrison and atheist Dawkins, a romantic interest soon develops. During their date, Dawkins refers to religion as an argument from ignorance, and Garrison announces that she is now an atheist. The two later have sex, and Garrison pushes Dawkins to the realization it is his duty to rid the world of religion and bring about peace with its abolition. Garrison begins to admonish students who express a belief in God, mocking that they likely believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster. By this time, Cartman has frozen to death, and a freak avalanche has buried his body. Cartman ultimately remains frozen for over five centuries, until being discovered and revived by members of the Unified Atheist League (UAL). In the year 2546, the entire world is atheistic and dedicated to rationality and science. Atheism is divided into several denominations. These factions are at war with each other over who has the right answer to \\"the great question\\". Cartman is informed of the possible presence of a Nintendo Wii at the Museum of Technology in New New Hampshire. However, they mention that before they are willing to take him there, they require some information alluding to a person they believe he knew in his time: the founder of the UAL who helped initiate a great event that made the entire world atheist. Suddenly, the UAL comes under attack from a rival group, the United Atheist Alliance (UAA), and Cartman is taken captive aboard a UAA ship. The UAA commander contacts yet another faction, the Allied Atheist Allegiance (AAA), who are made up solely of highly evolved sea otters. The Commander of the UAA boasts to the otters about their possession of Cartman, and of how because of this, they are now the atheists in control. This provokes a threatening response from the AAA. Production Series co- creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone described the production of \\"Go God Go\\" and \\"Go God Go XII\\" as \\"painful\\", mainly because of how it deals with atheism. They spoke about how difficult it is to make such a subject humorous without seeming \\"preachy\\". For a time, the episode actually did end up feeling \\"preachy\\" because too many ideas and statements were present. To rectify this, large portions of the episodes that more reflected Parker and Stone's personal opinions were removed and replaced with less serious material. The decision to do an episode with the theme of atheism was finalized when Penn Jillette emailed Parker and Stone expressing his disappointment in finding out that they are not atheists themselves. Parker and Stone's religion was questioned in an interview, which prompted Jillette's email. It was assumed that they were atheists, so in the interview they clarified that they were not strictly atheists. While this was happening, Parker was anticipating the release of the Nintendo Wii, so it was decided that this scenario would also be a theme in the episode. At the end of \\"Go God Go\\", Cartman is sent to the future; Parker and Stone loved the idea, in-part because it presented the opportunity for easy-to-write material. However, they had essentially forced themselves to create another episode, which they partially disliked because it meant they'd have to write more material that concerns atheism when they felt they had done enough. Several aspects of both \\"Go God Go\\" and \\"Go God Go XII\\" pay homage to Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, a science fiction adventure television series produced by Universal Studios. Richard Dawkins and his book The God Delusion is also parodied. Parker and Stone were very pleased with the work of the animation staff in regards to the designs of the scenes in the future, particularly praising them for accomplishing so much in the short amount of time that a South Park episode is produced. Reception =Critical response= Dan Iverson of IGN gave the episode a positive review, with a score of 9.0 out of 10, writing: \\"Between the shocking Mrs. Garrison story and the hilarious Wii promotion by Cartman, we totally recommend watching this episode.\\" =Nintendo= The week of November 5, 2006, a poll on Nintendo.com asked \\"How bad do you want a Wii?\\". The responses were \\"Bad\\", \\"Way Bad\\", and \\"Worse than Cartman\\", with the third choice receiving 80% of the votes.Nintendo.com Home Page 2006-11-07 At Nintendo's 2007 Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference, a clip of the episode where Cartman tells his mother he must have a Wii was included in a montage of clips about the demand for the Wii. Nintendo also sent the South Park staff several free Wii consoles after the episode first aired. =Richard Dawkins' response= Richard Dawkins was critical of his depiction in the two-parter episodes Richard Dawkins reacted to the two-part episode by saying, \\"I'm buggered if I like being portrayed as a cartoon character buggering a bald transvestite. I wouldn't have minded so much if only it had been in the service of some serious point, but if there was a serious point in there I couldn't discern it.\\" In a Q&A; session at the Free Library of Philadelphia, Dawkins said: \\"I would have thought they could at least have got an actor that could do a proper British accent. Now, if only I could be offered a cameo role in The Simpsons, I could show that actor how to do a real British accent.\\" Dawkins later made a cameo in The Simpsons episode \\"Black-Eyed, Please\\". When asked about the episode in a 2012 interview with Playboy magazine, Dawkins, who said it was the only episode of South Park he had seen, thought the fighting among the different atheist sects had \\"a certain amount of truth in it\\" and harbored a greater potential for satire. It reminded him of the Judean People's Front and the People's Front of Judea from the film Monty Python‚Äôs Life of Brian, but felt that too much of the episode was devoted to ridiculing him by depicting him having sex with Ms. Garrison. He commented, \\"That isn't satire because it has nothing to do with what I stand for. And the scatological part, where they had somebody throwing shit, which stuck to my forehead‚Äîthat‚Äôs not even funny.\\" References External links * \\"Go God Go\\" Full episode at South Park Studios * \\"Go God Go\\" Episode guide at South Park Studios Category:Fiction set in the 26th century Category:Atheism in television Category:Cryonics in fiction Category:Evolution in popular culture Category:LGBT-related South Park episodes Category:Richard Dawkins Category:South Park episodes in multiple parts Category:South Park (season 10) episodes Category:Television episodes about time travel Category:Transgender- related television episodes ","title":"Go God Go"},{"id":"7687360","text":"ChatNow is a mobile phone-like walkie-talkie developed by Hasbro's Tiger Electronics division for the preteen market.

Early life and education DeCosta attended high school at Taunton High School (Taunton, Massachusetts) and played college football at Colby College, where he served as team captain in 1992 under head coach, Tom Austin.. A Dean's List student who graduated with honors, DeCosta earned bachelor of art's degrees in English and Classical Civilizations in 1993. In 1996, DeCosta received a master's degree in English from Trinity College, Hartford. Executive career =Baltimore Ravens= Prior to his stint in the NFL, DeCosta worked at Trinity College (1993‚Äì1996) as a Graduate Fellow, coaching football in the Athletic Department. Named as one of the most powerful people in sports under the age of 35, DeCosta has played a strong role in the drafting of Pro Bowl players like Ed Reed, Terrell Suggs, Jamal Lewis, Bart Scott, Le'Ron McClain, Haloti Ngata, Marshal Yanda, Ben Grubbs, Ray Rice , C. J. Mosley, Brandon Williams, and Kyle Juszczyk along with significant contributors Tony Weaver, Mark Clayton, Chester Taylor, Ed Hartwell, Dawan Landry, Jason Brown, Jared Gaither, Sam Koch, Lardarius Webb, Torrey Smith, Ricky Wagner, Pernell McPhee, and Kelechi Osemele. In April 2008, DeCosta and the Ravens traded the eighth pick in the 2008 Draft to the Jacksonville Jaguars for the 26th pick in the first round and other picks.USA Today report The Ravens then traded the 26th overall pick and their third round pick to the Houston Texans for the 18th pick, where the Ravens then selected 2008 Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Year winner, QB Joe Flacco from the University of Delaware.Baltimore Ravens official website In his first season as Ravens starting quarterback, Flacco led the Ravens to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers. The next year, in April 2009, DeCosta and Newsome traded the 26th pick in the 2009 Draft and another pick to the New England Patriots for the 23rd pick in the first round.\\"OVERALL, A SUCCESSFUL DAY ONE FOR OZ AND THE BALTIMORE RAVENS\\" Bleacher Report. The Ravens then selected 2009 Offensive Rookie of the Year runner-up Michael Oher, OT, from Ole Miss.\\"Training camp-Day 5\\" Baltimore Sun. Oher was featured in Michael Lewis' acclaimed book, The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game which was also made into a movie starring Sandra Bullock.

DeCosta removed his name from consideration prior to interviewing for the post.\\"Schneider, Ross still will interview with Seahawks\\" NFL.com. One year later in March 2011, in an interview at the annual Owners' Meetings in New Orleans, Louisiana, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti referred to DeCosta as General Manager Ozzie Newsome's eventual successor.\\"Q&A; with Steve Bisciotti\\" Baltimore Sun. DeCosta was on the radar for several teams with General Manager openings following the 2011 season including serious interest from the Chicago Bears. However, in January 2012 DeCosta signed a new contract with Baltimore that would make him one of the highest paid executives in football and ensure that he stayed on as Ozzie Newsome's eventual replacement.\\"DeCosta‚Äôs new deal keeps him from leaving Baltimore\\" NBC Sports On February 2, 2018, the Ravens officially announced that DeCosta would take over as General Manager for Ozzie Newsome following the 2018 season. That year, the Ravens made news on draft day by trading their second round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft to the Eagles in exchange for Philadelphia's 2018 first round pick, the last pick of the round. Newsome and DeCosta used that pick to select QB Lamar Jackson from Louisville. Jackson finished the 2018 season as the starting quarterback for the Ravens, leading the Ravens over the last seven games to a 6-1 record and an AFC North championship. The Ravens played a home playoff game vs the Los Angeles Chargers on January 5th, losing to the Chargers and being eliminated from the playoffs in the process. Jackson was the youngest quarterback to ever start a playoff game. DeCosta's first off- season (2019) as General Manager was defined by a series of moves that were controversial at the outset \\"Eric DeCosta Named Sporting News' NFL Executive of the Year\\" Baltimoreravens.com. DeCosta's first move was trading QB Joe Flacco to the Denver Broncos for a 4th round draft pick in the 2019 NFL Draft (later used to select RB Justice Hill). The Ravens reached a long-term contracts with Nick Boyle, from Delaware, regarded as being one of the better blocking tight ends in the league, and Tavon Young, a CB who played at Temple and was a fourth-round pick in 2017. At the start of the new league year, DeCosta allowed four starters from the 2018 Ravens defense to test the free- agency market, Pro Bowl linebacker C.J. Mosley, outside linebacker Za'Darius Smith, Pro Bowl outside linebacker Terrell Suggs, and Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle. All four players subsequently reached lucrative deals with other teams, creating major voids on the Ravens roster. In response, the Ravens and DeCosta surprised the NFL and reached a four-year agreement with All-Pro safety Earl Thomas and a three-year contract with running back Mark Ingram. They also extended Pro Bowl kicker Justin Tucker and selected WR Marquise Brown, OLB Jaylon Ferguson, WR Miles Boykin, RB Justice Hill, and OG Ben Powers among others in the 2019 NFL Selection Draft. DeCosta made three training-camp trades with other teams that fortified the roster and accumulated additional draft picks for the 2020 Draft. The Ravens traded OG Alex Lewis to the NY Jets for a 7th round draft pick (later used to select safety Geno Stone out of Iowa). Also, the Ravens got a 5th round pick from the Minnesota Vikings for Kaare Vedvik, an undrafted punter/kicker who was not going to make the 53-man roster due to Justin Tucker and Sam Koch. Vedvik was cut by the Vikings prior to week 1 of the regular season. Lastly, the Ravens traded OG/OT Jermaine Eluemunor and a 6th round pick to the New England Patriots for their 4th round pick (later used to select LB Malik Harrison from Ohio State in the 2020 NFL Draft). The Ravens started the season 2-2 before winning their remaining twelve regular season games and finishing with the best record in the NFL (14-2) in the 2019 season. Along the way, just before the trade deadline, DeCosta made a season-changing trade by dealing a 5th round pick and LB Kenny Young to the Los Angeles Rams for CB Marcus Peters, a move that seemingly fortified the Ravens defense. DeCosta also reached extensions with Pro Bowl fullback Patrick Ricard and veteran wide receiver Willie Snead during the 2019 campaign. Earning the #1 seed in the AFC and a first-round playoff bye, the Ravens, despite being huge favorites, were beaten in the Divisional Round (January 12, 2020) by the Tennessee Titans at home in Baltimore. Ravens players and coaches accumulated many accolades after the historic 2019 regular season, including thirteen Pro Bowl players (including Ingram, Thomas, and Peters), Coach of the Year John Harbaugh, and NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. On May 28th, 2020, DeCosta was named NFL Executive of the Year by Sporting News for his work throughout the 2019 off-season and regular season. This award, as voted by his peers, dates back to 1955 and features recipients like Dan Reeves, George Halas, Al Davis, Tex Schramm, Bobby Beathard, George Young, Bill Polian, and Ron Wolf, among others.

It is used to study genome structure and organization and has also been used to simplify the sequencing of genomes that contain large amounts of repetitive sequence. Procedure The procedure involves heating a sample of genomic DNA until it denatures into the single stranded-form, and then slowly cooling it, so the strands can pair back together. While the sample is cooling, measurements are taken of how much of the DNA is base paired at each temperature. The amount of single and double- stranded DNA is measured by rapidly diluting the sample, which slows reassociation, and then binding the DNA to a hydroxylapatite column. The column is first washed with a low concentration of sodium phosphate buffer, which elutes the single-stranded DNA, and then with high concentrations of phosphate, which elutes the double stranded DNA. The amount of DNA in these two solutions is then measured using a spectrophotometer. Repetitive DNA sequences renature at lower C0t values than single-copy sequences. Analysis Since a sequence of single-stranded DNA needs to find its complementary strand to reform a double helix, common sequences renature more rapidly than rare sequences. Indeed, the rate at which a sequence will reassociate is proportional to the number of copies of that sequence in the DNA sample. A sample with a highly-repetitive sequence will renature rapidly, while complex sequences will renature slowly. However, instead of simply measuring the percentage of double-stranded DNA versus time, the amount of renaturation is measured relative to a C0t value. The C0t value is the product of C0 (the initial concentration of DNA), t (time in seconds), and a constant that depends on the concentration of cations in the buffer. Repetitive DNA will renature at low C0t values, while complex and unique DNA sequences will renature at high C0t values. The fast renaturation of the repetitive DNA is because of the availability of numerous complementary sequences. Application to genome sequencing C0t filtration is a technique that uses the principles of DNA renaturation kinetics to separate the repetitive DNA sequences that dominate many eukaryotic genomes from \\"gene-rich\\" single/low-copy sequences. This allows DNA sequencing to concentrate on the parts of the genome that are most informative and interesting, which will speed up the discovery of new genes and make the process more efficient.L History It was first developed and utilized by Roy Britten and his colleagues at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the 1960s.Davidson EH, Britten RJ (1973) Organization, transcription, and regulation in the animal genome. Quart. Rev. Biol. 48: 565-613. Of particular note, it was through C0t analysis that the redundant (repetitive) nature of eukaryotic genomes was first discovered. However, it wasn't until the breakthrough DNA reassociation kinetics experiments of Britten and his colleagues that it was shown that not all DNA coded for genes. In fact, their experiments demonstrated that the majority of eukaryotic genomic DNA is composed of repetitive, non-coding elements.

All 37 on board were killed in the accident. Flight 706 began its day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was scheduled to stop at Chicago before travelling to Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami, Florida. It arrived at Chicago in the early morning and left soon afterwards, being cleared for takeoff at 8:55 AM. Takeoff was normal until the aircraft reached the altitude of 100 feet above ground level, when witnesses noticed a slight change in the sound of the Electra's engines. The aircraft began a gentle bank to the right as the starboard wing began to drop. The bank angle increased to 35¬∞; at that point the tower controllers picked up a garbled broadcast believed to be from the pilots. The aircraft climbed to approximately 300 feet but continued to bank, eventually reaching a bank angle of over 50¬∞. At that point, the starboard wing nicked a series of high-tension power lines running along the south boundary of the airport; shortly after that, the aircraft struck an embankment and cartwheeled onto its nose. The forward fuselage broke off, the plane pancaked and skidded, then launched into the air and slammed nose-first into the ground, falling over on its back and exploding into a ball of flame. The accident took less than two minutes from the beginning of takeoff until the final crash. Investigators with the Civil Aeronautics Board determined that the cable physically connecting the first officer's control wheel to the aileron boost unit had disconnected. This had caused the ailerons to put the aircraft in a starboard-wing-down attitude, and had prevented the pilots from being able to correct the bank. The cables attaching the pilots' control wheels to the aileron boost unit had been removed two months before the accident during routine maintenance; a safety cable that held part of the assembly together had not been replaced when the cables were hooked back up. The contact slowly separated, until it completely failed during the takeoff sequence.

These priests were all descendants of Aaron, who had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. However, Nadab and Abihu died before Aaron and only Eleazar and Ithamar had sons. One priest, Zadok, from Eleazar's descendants and another priest, Ahimelech, from Ithamar's descendants were designated to help create the various priestly orders. Sixteen of Eleazar's descendants were selected to head priestly orders while only eight of Ithamar's descendants were so chosen. The passage states that this was done because of the greater number of leaders among Eleazar's descendants. Lots were drawn to designate the order of ministering for the heads of the priestly orders when they entered the temple.

History =Early years= Victory Sportif Club was founded by Augustin R. Viau on 7 March 1945.Haiti - List of Foundation Dates They were affiliated in 1947 by the FHF and assigned to the second division where they won the league promoting themselves to the first division for 1948. Their first win came against Melbourne (Bel Air) by the score of 2‚Äì0.RSSSF - Haiti 1947 On 16 January 1948, Victory played their first match in the top-tier division that ended in defeat to Racing by 1‚Äì0 (by goal of Antoine Tassy). =Golden years (1955‚Äì1965)= During this decade, Victory gained a leading role in the league, national team and even internationally; a credit to a major change in the style of play of Victory led by the technical direction of Michel Alerte (alias \\"Sonson\\"). In 1955, the tenth anniversary of the club, Victory won its first Coupe d'Ha√Øti (Coupe Vincent) by defeating Petit-Go√¢ve (4‚Äì0), Racing (3‚Äì0) and P√©tion-Ville in the final (3‚Äì1). In 1957, Victory played a return match in Cura√ßao with a 0‚Äì0 draw against the Sithoc, after a 1‚Äì0 win in Port-au-Prince. In 1958, Victory played a successful tour in Costa Rica, El Salvador to participate in a tournament of the winners of the cup and placed second with a 3‚Äì2 win over the C.S.D. Comunicaciones with goals by Ren√© Vertus. During 1958‚Äì1962, Victory was one of the strongest clubs in Haitian football and won its first national championship (Coupe Pradel) in 1960. The following year, although reigning champions of the league, a dispute between the FHF and Victory led the club to lose its invitation in a tournament organized for the arrival of Czech club, Red Star Bratislava. The Czech club went on to defeat Racing (3‚Äì1), Aigle Noir (4‚Äì0), and the Haitian national selection (4‚Äì0). In an attempt to save the national honor, Victory was recalled and defeated the Czechs 2‚Äì0. The following season in 1961, Victory continued its surge and won the Coupe d'Ha√Øti (Coupe Vincent) by defeating Petit-Go√¢ve (6‚Äì3) Aigle Noir (3‚Äì2), Racing (3‚Äì1) and Etoile Ha√Øtienne in the final 2‚Äì1. The club's physical condition was a very important ingredient to their success; prepared by General Claude Raymond and his brother Dr. Adrien Raymond, who was club president and administered care to the players, Franck Civil who led in technical preparation and Michel Oreste Alerte in tactical development respectively. =Steady decline (1966‚Äì1976)= As the members who contributed to Victory's early success began to gradually disband, seven to eight of club's next ten years ended in average results and a low in 1971, where Victory was invited to play a quadrangular relegation playoff between Don Bosco, Etoile, Bacardi to determine 1st or 2nd division status for the next season. Victory instead decided to withdraw from the 70‚Äì71 national championship after weighing the arbitrary principle and were absent from national sports for about a year and a half. During this time, the club chose to restructure itself and club members decided to focus on student athletes. The Coll√®ge Canado-Ha√Øtien, where Franck Civil and Frantz Joseph of Victory coached the school's selections, allowed them to recruit the majority of its reserve team consisted of Bernier, Ronald Punn, Gerald Jean, G√©rard Janvier Fils, H√©rold, and Rapha√´l Alexis. With the reconstruction of the senior team, Victory returned to the Pradel Cup in 1975 chaired by Mr. Lionel Leconte, finishing second after losing 0‚Äì1 in the final against the Aigle Noir. =Recent history (2010‚Äì)= Victory won the s√©rie de cl√¥ture in the 2010‚Äì11 season by defeating the Association de Saint-Louis du Nord (1‚Äì0) by a goal scored by Wilfrid Brunache.

Ricardo Charles received the trophy of best scorer with 14 goals. The FHF suspended the club following the 2013 season, for refusing to honor fixtures that included clubs who had not qualified based on merit.

The MailStation is no longer sold by either EarthLink or Amazon. The MailStation was designed to send and receive e-mails via a standard POTS telephone line. It was intended as an alternative to a laptop computer in regards to its messaging capabilities and also as an alternative to a personal computer for those who for whatever reason do not have access to one but who wish to enjoy the benefits of e-mail. The device could hold up to four hundred messages and up to one thousand contacts. Since it was not a personal/laptop computer, the MailStation could not be used to view attachments.  Mailstation models  Since the introduction of Mailstation in 1999 it has been released in 5 different models: *Mivo 100 *Mivo 150 *Mivo 200 *Mivo 250 *Mivo 350 All the models are portable and run on either 3 to 4 AA batteries or with an AC adapter. It has a parallel printer port for printer connection. Though the previous models (Mivo 100, Mivo 150, Mivo 200) didn't have the capability of receiving attachments, later that drawback was rectified with the Mivo 250 and Mivo 350. Mivo 250 and 350 had the capability of receiving attachments (i.e. gif and jpg images) but the size of the mail along with the attachment should be less than 100KB. In addition to receiving attachments, the Mivo 250 and Mivo 350 include a separate wireless modem allowing untethered mobility for short distances. All the models have a full size keyboard and extra features such as calendar and calculator.  Functionality  Mailstation is an e-mail device which can work both by using a power adapter or using batteries. The email can be drafted while offline, and when connected can be sent using a button on the device called get mail/mail. As on PCs, when the button is pressed, the device sends queued emails and receives new emails from the server. Users have a web based account (Similar to Yahoo) which can be accessed through any internet connected PC. Emails are downloaded from the website to the Mailstation for offline viewing. The Mailstation connects to the server for a few seconds to send and receive messages, and disconnects after that.  Extra features  Mailstation can also be used to receive content related to weather, lottery, finance news, astrology and TV Listings. The updates are sent to the users when they are available from the service provider.  Earthlink support dwindling  For a period of time after production of Mailstation hardware ceased and Earthlink discontinued the sale of the devices, the company still allowed new customers to sign up for the Mailstation service. At some point prior to early 2011, Earthlink stopped accepting new Mailstation accounts, and will not transfer an existing Mailstation account to a new device. This implies that while Earthlink continues to provide the service for existing Mailstation customers, the number of Mailstation accounts Earthlink services can only decrease as customers voluntarily cancel their accounts and/or the physical Mailstation devices still being serviced fail.

He also is a former president of the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, United States. Birth and early years Spencer was born near Batesville, Mississippi, the eldest son of Methodist Episcopal minister Reverend Flournoy Poindexter Spencer and Alice Eleanor Manes. Alice was the daughter of Henry Manes of Thomasville, Georgia.Cook, 1946 Matthew had two sisters and one brother: Eleanor Elizabeth (1883‚Äì?), Leslie Louise (1887‚Äì?) and Flournoy Poindexter (1885‚Äì?). Spencer was able to trace his American ancestry to some 55 years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Early career In 1903, Spencer graduated from Kentucky Wesleyan College with an A.B. (bachelor's) degree. Later in 1904, he obtained his A.M. (Master's degree) from the same college. While completing these degrees, he worked as part-time instructor and later professor (1903‚Äì1904) in the college's English department. In 1905, Spencer attended Northwestern University where he received an additional A.M. degree. Between 1905‚Äì1906 and again in 1909‚Äì1910, Spencer also served as fellow of English at the University of Chicago, earning his Ph.D. from the university in 1910. Prior to that, Spencer began teaching at Wofford College (Spartanburg, South Carolina) in 1906, as an assistant professor of English. While teaching at Wofford, Spencer met and married Ms. Lois Hill, the sister of Mrs. Coleman Bailey Waller of Spartanburg. Journalism and Washington Spencer left Woman's College in 1911 to assume a position as English professor at Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin. He stayed at this position for seven years during which time he also served as reporter and copy reader (1913, 1917‚Äì1918) for the Milwaukee Journal. According to Emory Magazine, \\"his purpose [both as writer and professor] was to write a trilogy to separate the teaching of journalism into news writings, copy and editorial writing\\" (Spencer, 1970). In 1917, shortly before leaving the college, Spencer became chief editor of the Milwaukee Journal. This position was short-lived as Spencer felt it his duty, as war raged in Europe, to enlist in the military. During the later part of the First World War (1918), Spencer became a captain in military intelligence for the United States Army. After the war, Lyle maintained his Army ties and in 1929 was appointed lieutenant colonel, in the special reservesCattell, 1941 He retained this rank until his retirement some ten years later. In September, 1919 Spencer resumed teaching, accepting a position as Director of the School of Journalism at the University of Washington. A year later, Spencer married Helen McNaughton, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander McNaughton. Lyle and Helen went on to raise a family which consisted of three children: Orton Flournoy, Judson and Helen (another son, Lyle Manly Spencer was from a previous marriage to Miss Hill). His first marriage had ended, rather bitterly, some years before. The reasons however, remain a mystery as Spencer refused to discuss, even privately, his early life. On January 11, 1926, Spencer was appointed dean of the school of journalism. In September the following year, Spencer accepted the position as president of the university. According to Charles M. Gates' book, The First Century at the University of Washington, the political climate at the university (under Governor Hartley's administration) became so intolerable that the then president of the university, Dr. Suzzallo was forced to resign. The presidency was then passed to Spencer, former dean of the university's college of journalism. Faculty and staff favored the new administration since more attention was given to salary increases and promotion opportunities. Spencer supported the efforts of the administration in providing a higher level in scholarship and standards. During his inaugural address he stated, ‚ÄúWhen the Universities in any country cease to be in close touch with the social life and institutions of the people ... their days of influence are numbered.‚Äù Spencer also advocated admission requirements be stiffened and that elective and so-called \\"sop-courses\\" be dropped. He felt arts and sciences should be the heart of higher education thereby greatly diminishing the role of technical and vocational training. After a short time, opposition to Spencer's programs began to grow. One of the first groups to express dissatisfaction was the Seattle High School Teacher's League. The league felt that the university and especially the president were being biased toward the graduate school, and were preventing new students from enrolling. The university's policy, according to League members, served to be discriminatory toward students who possessed merely average ability.Gates, 1961 Syracuse In 1932, a new governor was elected by the state of Washington. 1932 also marked an important change in university administrative autonomy and student accessibility. With the new direction of state government and university procedure, it became evident that there must be changes on the highest level of the university's administration. For these, and other reasons, Spencer tended his resignation as president of the university. After leaving the University of Washington in April 1933, Spencer traveled to the University of Chicago where he taught one year. In 1934 Spencer organized the school of journalism at Syracuse University, believing journalism was a specialized form of English deserving its own curriculum. That same year, he was appointed the university's first dean of the school of journalism. During this period Spencer wrote several major journalism textbooks, including News Writing and Editorial Writing. Later, while on leave, Spencer traveled to Egypt in 1936 and 1945 and became visiting professor at American University in Egypt.The Jaques Cattell Press, 1964 During his first five-month visit he founded the university's department of journalism.Spencer, 1970 During the war years Spencer also established the War Service College at Syracuse University. The college provided hard core courses in math, science and language for men about to enter military service. It was also during this time that he was instrumental in establishing propaganda as a specialized journalistic form. Death Before retiring from Syracuse in 1951 as dean emeritus, Spencer had also lectured at Oriental Culture Summer College in Tokyo (1940), received the Columbia Scholastic Press Association's Gold Medal (1946), and Syracuse University's Distinguished Service Medal. He also possessed honorary doctorates from Northwestern University (1928), College of Puget Sound (1932), Kentucky Wesleyan College (1942), and Syracuse University (1951). Upon retirement, Spencer moved to Clearwater, Florida where he later died at the age of 87 Kritsberg, 1990Foard, 1990 Legacy During his professional career, Spencer authored several academic works including: William Gilmore Simms's The Yemassee (editor), Corpus Christi Pageants in England, Practical English Punctuation, News Writing, and Editorial Writing. Spencer was also active in various societies including: the American Association of Schools and Journalism Departments, Tau Kappa Alpha, Sigma Delta Chi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Phi Beta Kappa (April 24, 1931), Rotary Club, Sons of the American Revolution, Wisconsin Academy of Science, Arts and Letters, and Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (Eng.).

The village's local newspaper is The Dunoon and District Gazette, with past copies available at the Lismore Library and the Richmond River Historical Society.  Services  Like the other small villages dotted along the ridges in the hills heading north out of Lismore, it is a quiet town, but the community and sports facilities available give it a strong community spirit. There is a post office, primary school, mechanic, herbalist and general store/ bottle shop. Dunoon has a community hall with a variety of activities including the Dunoon Film Club, exercise classes, social events and church services. Many community gatherings occur at the Sports Club. The popular sports are cricket and football, although there are other sports such as Little Athletics and tennis. The Dunoon sports club also has a restaurant, a playground, a tennis court and football fields with lights. Dunoon also has two actively used church buildings; one Catholic and the other Anglican.

The other two former church buildings have been / are being converted to residential use, with both retaining many of the original features.  Development  Dunoon is currently predominantly a unilinear development, but a major land release has expanded off the main ridge. Community concerns over the social impact on the town of a second development were allayed in February 2009 when developers withdrew their application to develop a new subdivision from Lismore City Council.

Designed for general- purpose cryptography, its current use is encryption of high-definition television broadcasts in Japan.  Cipher details  MULTI2 is a symmetric key algorithm with variable number of rounds. It has a block size of 64 bits, and a key size of 64 bits. A 256-bit implementation-dependent substitution box constant is used during key schedule. Scramble and descramble is done by repeating four basic functions (involutions).  History  * 1988 MULTI2 patent applied by Hitachi, Ltd on April 28 * 1989 Algorithm announced to DPS- SIG Information Processing Society of Japan * 1991 Patent number 4982429 granted for MULTI2 algorithm in United States * 1994 Algorithm registered with ISO/IEC 9979 and assigned registration number 9 * 1995 MULTI2 adopted as standard cipher for CS-Digital broadcasting in Japan * 1998 Japanese Patent number 2760799 granted for MULTI2 algorithm  Cryptanalysis  There are a large class of equivalent keys in the Multi2 block cipher. The largest class (so far found) stems from the fact that the Pi3 round function in the key schedule is not bijective. For example, with the following 40-byte input key to the key schedule: 45 ec 86 d8 b6 5e 24 d5 38 fe 1d 90 ce fc a4 22 3e 39 1b e3 da 03 0f cb 9c 9e d7 c6 1c e4 73 61 d0 fa 39 86 58 5d 5b 90 You can perform the following single byte modifications (modification here means XOR against the original key byte): Can mod byte 5 with CF Can mod byte 7 with 77 Can mod byte 20 with 9A Can mod byte 20 with A9 Can mod byte 20 with D7 Can mod byte 21 with 35 Can mod byte 21 with 6A Can mod byte 21 with 9F Can mod byte 21 with CC Can mod byte 22 with 4D Can mod byte 22 with 7A Can mod byte 22 with A7 Can mod byte 23 with 53 Can mod byte 23 with AE In this case there are 15 different keys which will schedule to the same 8 32-bit round keys for the ciphers bulk encryption path. The keys are all different in the first keyword used in the Pi3 round function (keys k[1] and k[5]). The collision occurs because a single byte difference turns into a pattern like 0X0X0000 (rotated by 0, 8, 16, or 24 bits) which then expands to a variation of 0X000X00 and finally in the second last line (with the rotate by 16 and the XOR) the differences cancel out. Turning into a zero-delta. The problem stems from the fact that the function x = ROL(x, y) ^ x Where ROL means rotate left by y bits, is not bijective for any value of y. There are similar problems with the Pi2 and Pi4 functions but they are seemingly harder to exploit because the rotation value is smaller. There are other observations too, for example x = ROL(x, 1) - x Found in Pi3, is an identity function for 50% of the values of x (where the most significant byte is zero). This also means it is possible to have weak keys where instead of forcing single byte differences in the key, they are in the plaintext into Pi3 produces a zero-delta output and possibly leading to a 1R differential.

Broken Angel or the Broken Angel house was a building located at 4/6 Downing Street in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, at the intersection of Downing and Quincy street. The house was featured prominently as a backdrop in the film Dave Chappelle's Block Party and was demolished in 2014.  Design  Artists Arthur and Cynthia Wood built the top part of the structure in the 27 years that they were owners of the building. Arthur had a camera obscura on the top area and a room that looked like it floated in the air. The inside was like a huge cathedral with arches and colorful \\"stained glass windows\\" that were made from the remains of bottles and glass.  History  Brooklyn artist Arthur Wood purchased the 4-story brick tenement building in 1979 for $2,000. He lived in the house with his wife Cynthia and raised their son Christopher who is now a stone carver. The artist explored ideas about design and vernacular architecture with improvised construction to add new floors and rooms to the original building, to the point where the structure reaches 104 feet, or about 9 stories above the sidewalk. The site has been compared to Watts Towers in Los Angeles for the ad hoc construction and is acknowledged for its value as folk art and as part of the cultural heritage. As a result of a fire on October 10, 2006, the New York City Department of Buildings declared the building dangerous, telling Arthur and Cynthia that they had to go. A couple of days later police arrived, cordoned off Downing Street and had battering rams ready to strike down the door. When Arthur defied the vacate order by staying in the building, he was arrested. The police also arrested Cynthia who was outside with their dog Jack. Arthur and Cynthia were taken away in handcuffs and kept at the precinct for many hours. Arthur and his wife and pets lived in a car outside their own building during the cold winter months that followed. On January 11, 2007 it was announced that Arthur Wood had partnered with local real estate developer Shahn Christian Andersen to renovate Broken Angel, build a new addition to its side, and convert the building to residential condominiums and artist space. Despite the Woods' efforts the house was a square box, and the plans to renovate it under the direction of Shahn Christian Andersen were never completed. Faced with a foreclosure from Madison Realty Bank, and Cynthia being diagnosed with cancer, the Woods struggled to fight the foreclosure and get their house back. Cynthia Wood died at the age of 72. =Demolition= In January 2009, the house was put on the market by owner Arthur Wood for $4 million and banks filed for foreclosure on the development loans. The site (including the house), was bought by developer Alex Barrett in January 2014 who paid $4.1 million for the structure; he plans to convert the site into an eight-unit condominium building, with a brand new two-unit building next door at 8 Downing Street. Demolition of the house began in April, 2014. In May, 2014 the structure was completely demolished.  Featured in movies  This building has also a small story segment in movie Dave Chapelle's Block Party. The couple that owns the building shares some of their story with the building and as well as their personal stories.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425598/  References  Category:Folly buildings in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Brooklyn Category:Buildings and structures in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2014 Category:2014 disestablishments in New York (state) ","title":"Broken Angel House"},{"id":"7687767","text":"The Forster‚ÄìDecker method is a series of chemical reactions that transform a primary amine (1) ultimately to a secondary amine (6).Decker, H.; Becker, P.

Epibolic movement is the way in which a layer epithelial cells spreads. This can be achieved in multiple ways. When undergoing epiboly, a monolayer of cells must undergo a physical change in shape in order to spread. Alternatively, multiple layers of cells can also undergo epiboly as the position of cells is changed or the cell layers undergo intercalation. While human embryos do not experience epiboly, this movement can be studied in sea urchins, tunicates, amphibians, and most commonly zebrafish. Epibolic movement of cells during gastrulation Zebrafish =General movements= Epiboly in zebrafish is the first coordinated cell movement, and begins once the embryo has completed the blastula stage. At this point the zebrafish embryo contains three portions: an epithelial monolayer known as the enveloping layer (EVL), a yolk syncytial layer (YSL) which is a membrane-enclosed group of nuclei that lie on top of the yolk cell, and the deep cells (DEL) of the blastoderm which will eventually form the embryo's three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). The EVL, YSL, and DEL all undergo epiboly. 222x222pxCartoon of a 4-hour post fertilization zebrafish embryo, before the initiation of epiboly Radial intercalation occurs in the DEL. Interior cells of the blastoderm move towards the outer cells, thus \\"intercalating\\" with each other. The blastoderm begins to thin as it spreads toward the vegetal pole of the embryo until it has completely engulfed the yolk cell. The EVL also moves vegetally during epiboly, increasing its surface area as it spreads. Work in the ray-finned fish Fundulus has shown that no large rearrangements occur in the EVL; instead, cells at the leading edge of the EVL align and constrict. The YSL also moves towards the vegetal pole, spreading along the surface of the yolk and migrating slightly ahead of the blastomeres. Once epiboly is complete, the DEL, EVL, and YSL have engulfed the yolk cell, forming a closure known as the blastopore. =Molecular mechanisms of epiboly=  Cytoskeletal and cell adhesion components  Completion of epiboly requires the coordination of cytoskeletal changes across the embryo. The YSL appears to play a prominent role in this process. Studies on Fundulus demonstrated that the YSL is capable of undergoing epiboly even when the blastoderm has been removed, however, the blastoderm cannot undergo epiboly in the absence of the YSL. In zebrafish, there is a microtubule array in the yolk that extends from the animal to the vegetal pole of the embryo, and that contracts as epiboly progresses. Treating embryos with the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole completely blocks epiboly of the YSL and partially blocks epiboly of the blastoderm, while treating with the microtubule stabilizing agent taxol blocks epiboly of all cell layers. There is also evidence for the importance of actin-based structures in epiboly. Ring-like structures of filamentous actin have been observed at the leading edge of the enveloping layer, where it contacts the yolk cell. It is thought that a network of filamentous actin in the yolk might constrict in a myosin-II dependent manner to close the blastopore at the end of epiboly, via a \\"purse-string mechanism\\". Treating embryos with the actin destabilizer cytochalasin b results in delayed or arrested epiboly. There is still debate on the extent to which the DEL and EVL epibolic movements are active movements.A. Bruce and R. Winklbauer 03-P005 Zebra fish epiboly as a model of vertebrate cell rearrangement, Mechanisms of Development 126 (2009) The EVL contacts the YSL by means of tight junctions. It is thought that these contacts allow the YSL to \\"tow\\" the EVL towards the vegetal pole. Claudin E is a molecule found in tight junctions that appears to be expressed in the EVL and required for normal zebrafish epiboly, supporting this hypothesis. Additionally, zebrafish embryos that fail to make a fully differentiated EVL show defects in epibolic movements of the DEL, EVL, and YSL, suggesting a requirement for a normal EVL for the epiboly of all three cell layers. The cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin has been shown to be required for the radial intercalation of the deep cells. Many other molecules involved in cell- cell contact are implicated in zebrafish epiboly, including G alpha (12/13) which interacts with E-Cadherin and actin, as well as the cell adhesion molecule EpCam in the EVL, which may modulate adhesion with the underlying deep cells. Signaling The molecule fibronectin has been found to play a role in radial intercalation. Other signaling pathways that appear to function in epiboly include the Wnt/PCP pathway, PDGF-PI3K pathway, Eph-Ephrin signaling, Jak-Stat signaling, and the MAP kinase cascade. Other vertebrates Epibolic movements have been conserved in vertebrates. Though most work on epiboly has been done in fish, there is also a body of work concerning epiboly in the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Comparisons of epiboly in amniotes, teleosts and X. laevis show that the key movement of epiboly in the fish and frog is radial intercalation while in amniotes it would appear to be cell division in the plane of the epithelium. All groups undergo cell shape changes such as the characteristic flattening of cells to increase surface area.

It was designated by the end of 1929 on various streets in adjoining cities and townships. By the 1940s, sections of it on the west and south sides of Grand Rapids were given new designations and the segment along the east side of town was finished. By late 1945 the highway designation was completely decommissioned in favor of other numbers. M-114 split into two branches, one running east‚Äìwest and the other running north‚Äìsouth. The east‚Äìwest spur routing is now local streets while the rest is part of state highways. History The first segments of M-114 were completed by January 1, 1930, and ran along the west side of Grand Rapids, on what is now Wilson Avenue between Lake Michigan Drive and Leonard Street. At the same time, what would become a spur was also finished from the town of Cascade to US Highway 131 (US 131, Division Avenue). By July 1 that same year, the southern segment was extended west to Clyde Park Avenue in Wyoming Township. By the end of 1936 M-114 was a three-legged trunkline around the Grand Rapids area. It started at US 16 in Walker Township and ran south to Grandville where it turned to run eastward to the community of Cascade. The third leg was shown on maps as under construction from a junction in Paris Township north to a junction with US 16 in East Grand Rapids; the trunkline continued north from US 16 to a junction with US 131 in Plainfield Township north of Grand Rapids. By June 15, 1942 the highways in the Grand Rapids area were reconfigured. A Bypass US 16 (Byp. US 16) designation was assigned to the portion of M-114 that traveled around the southwest side of Grand Rapids (now M-11), leaving just the east and unfinished north segments left. The section along the east side of the city was completed as M-114. A northern leg was added along 3 Mile Road at the same time. By 1945, the northern leg of M-114 was turned back to local control and removed from the highway system. The eastern leg was assigned a Byp. US 131 designation, thereby eliminating the last remaining portion of M-114. A Byp. M-21 designation was also used along part of the southern and eastern legs. East Beltline now carries M-37 and M-44. Route description As it existed before the designation was removed, M-114 started at the corner of Byp. US 16 (28th Street) and what is now East Beltline Avenue in Paris Township (now Kentwood) and ran northward. The trunkline intersected the mainline for US 16/M-50 at Cascade Road and the mainline for M-21 at Fulton Street near East Grand Rapids in Grand Rapids Township. Further north, the highway split into two. In Plainfield Township, a leg of M-114 continued west along the modern 3 Mile Road through an intersection with US 131 to terminate at Coit Avenue near the Grand River and the other leg continued north to a terminus with US 131 at Northland Drive and Plainfield Avenue.

Goals The goal of the Hutter Prize is to encourage research in artificial intelligence (AI). The organizers believe that text compression and AI are equivalent problems. Hutter proved that the optimal behavior of a goal-seeking agent in an unknown but computable environment is to guess at each step that the environment is probably controlled by one of the shortest programs consistent with all interaction so far.Marcus Hutter, Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions based on Algorithmic Probability, Springer, Berlin, 2004, http://www.hutter1.net/ai/uaibook.htm However, there is no general solution because Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. Hutter proved that in the restricted case (called AIXItl) where the environment is restricted to time t and space l, a solution can be computed in time O(t2l), which is still intractable. The organizers further believe that compressing natural language text is a hard AI problem, equivalent to passing the Turing test. Thus, progress toward one goal represents progress toward the other.Matt Mahoney, Rationale for a Large Text Compression Benchmark, 2006, http://mattmahoney.net/dc/rationale.html They argue that predicting which characters are most likely to occur next in a text sequence requires vast real-world knowledge. A text compressor must solve the same problem in order to assign the shortest codes to the most likely text sequences. Rules The contest is open-ended. It is open to everyone. To enter, a competitor must submit a compression program and a decompressor that decompresses to the file enwik9. It is also possible to submit a compressed file instead of the compression program. The total size of the compressed file and decompressor (as a Win32 or Linux executable) must not be larger than 99% of the previous prize winning entry. For each one percent improvement, the competitor wins 5,000 euros. The decompression program must also meet execution time and memory constraints, currently 100 hours on 1 core of a 3 GHz CPU with 10 GB memory. These constraints may be relaxed in the future. Submissions must be published in order to allow independent verification. There is a 30-day waiting period for public comment before awarding a prize. The rules do not require the release of source code, unless such release is required by the code's license (as in the case of PAQ, which is licensed under GPL). History The prize was announced on August 6, 2006 with a smaller text file: enwik8 consisting of 100MB. On February 21, 2020 it was expanded by a factor of 10, to enwik9 of 1GB. The original prize baseline was 18,324,887 bytes, achieved by PAQ8F. The expanded prize baseline was 116MB. On August 16, 2006, Rudi Cilibrasi submitted a modified version of PAQ8F called RAQ8G that added parenthesis modeling. However it failed to meet the 1% threshold. On the same day, but a few hours later Dmitry Shkarin submitted a modified version of his DURILCA compressorhttp://www.compression.ru/ds/ called DURILCA 0.5h, which improved compression by 1.5%. However it was disqualified for using 1.75 GB of memory. The decision to disqualify was controversial because the memory limits were not clearly specified in the rules at the time. On August 20, Alexander Ratushnyak submitted PAQ8HKCC, a modified version of PAQ8H, which improved compression by 2.6% over PAQ8F. He continued to improve the compression to 3.0% with PAQ8HP1 on August 21, 4% with PAQ8HP2 on August 28, 4.9% with PAQ8HP3 on September 3, 5.9% with PAQ8HP4 on September 10, and 5.9% with PAQ8HP5 on September 25. At that point he was declared the first winner of the Hutter prize, awarded 3416 euros, and the new baseline was set to 17,073,018 bytes. Ratushnyak has since broken his record multiple times, becoming the second (on May 14, 2007, with PAQ8HP12 compressing enwik8 to 16,481,655 bytes, and winning 1732 euros), third (on May 23, 2009, with decomp8 compressing the file to 15,949,688 bytes, and winning 1614 euros), and fourth (on Nov 4, 2017, with phda compressing the file to 15,284,944 bytes, and winning 2085 euros) winner of the Hutter prize.

He published a number of papers on neuropathological problems and muscle-related disorders. He is credited with the discovery of Plexus myentericus Auerbachi, or Auerbach's plexus, a layer of ganglion cells that provide control of movements of the gastro-intestinal tract, also known as the \\"myenteric plexus\\". \\"Friedreich‚ÄìAuerbach disease\\" is named after Auerbach and pathologist Nikolaus Friedreich (1825-1882). It is a rare disease characterized by hemi- hypertrophy of the facial features, tongue, and tonsils.Friedreich-Auerbach disease @ Who Named It Family Auerbach died in Breslau. His son Felix Auerbach was a renowned physicist.

The western black rhinoceros was believed to have been genetically different from other rhino subspecies. It was once widespread in the savanna of sub-Saharan Africa, but its numbers declined due to poaching. The western black rhinoceros resided primarily in Cameroon, but surveys since 2006 have failed to locate any individuals.  Taxonomy  This subspecies was named Diceros bicornis longipes by Ludwig Zukowsky in 1949. The word ‚Äúlongipes‚Äù is of Latin origin, combining longus (‚Äúfar, long‚Äù) and pƒìs (‚Äúfoot‚Äù). This refers to the subspecies‚Äô long distal limb segment, one of many special characteristics of the subspecies. Other distinct features of the western black rhino included the square based horn, first mandibular premolar retained in the adults, simple formed crochet of the maxillary premolar, and premolars commonly possessed crista. The population was first discovered in Southwest Chad, Central African Republic (CAR), North Cameroon, and Northeast Nigeria. The western black rhinoceros is one of three subspecies of the black rhinoceros to become extinct in historical times, the other two being the southern black rhinoceros and the north-eastern black rhinoceros.  Description  The western black rhinoceros measured long, had a height of , and weighed .Black Rhinoceros , Arkive It had two horns, the first measuring and the second . Like all Black Rhinos, they were browsers, and their common diet included leafy plants and shoots around their habitat. During the morning or evening, they would browse for food. During the hottest parts of the day, they slept or wallowed. They inhabited much of sub-Saharan Africa. Many people believe their horns held medicinal value, which led to heavy poaching. However, this belief has no grounding in scientific fact. Like most black rhinos, they are believed to have been nearsighted and would often rely on local birds, such as the red-billed oxpecker, to help them detect incoming threats.  Distribution  The black rhino, of which the western black rhinoceros is a subspecies, was most commonly located in several countries towards the southeast region of the continent of Africa. The native countries of the black rhino included: Angola, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Chad, Rwanda, Botswana, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zambia. There were several subspecies found in the western and southern countries of Tanzania through Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, to the northern and north-western and north-eastern parts of South Africa. The Black Rhino's most abundant population was found in South Africa and Zimbabwe, with a smaller population found in southern Tanzania. The Western subspecies of the Black Rhino was last recorded in Cameroon but is now considered to be extinct. However, other subspecies were introduced again into Botswana, Malawi, Swaziland and Zambia.  Population and decline  The western black rhinoceros was heavily hunted in the beginning of the 20th century, but the population rose in the 1930s after preservation actions were taken. As protection efforts declined over the years, so did the number of western black rhinos. By 1980 the population was in the hundreds. No animals are known to be held in captivity, however, it was believed in 1988 that approximately 20‚Äì30 were being kept for breeding purposes. Poaching continued and by 2000 only an estimated 10 survived. In 2001, this number dwindled to only five. While it was believed that around thirty still existed in 2004, this was later found to be based upon falsified data. The western black rhino emerged about 7 to 8 million years ago. It was a sub-species of the black rhino. For much of the 1900s, its population was the highest out of all the rhino species at almost 850,000 individuals. There was a 96% population decline in black rhinos, including the western black rhino, between 1970 and 1992. Widespread poaching is concluded to be partly responsible for bringing the species close to extinction, along with farmers killing rhinos to defend their crops in areas close to rhino territories,. The sub-species was declared officially extinct in 2011, with its last sighting reported in 2006 in Cameroon's Northern Province. In 2006, for six months, the NGO Symbiose and veterinarians Isabelle and Jean-Fran√ßois Lagrot with their local teams examined the common roaming ground of Diceros bicornis longipes in the northern province of Cameroon to assess the status of the last population of the western black rhino subspecies. For this experiment, 2,500 km of patrol effort resulted in no sign of rhino presence over the course of six months. The teams had concluded that the rhino was extinct approximately five years before it was officially declared so by the IUCN. =Protection attempts= There were many attempts to revive Western Black and Northern White. Rhino sperm was conserved in order to artificially fertilize females to produce offspring. Some attempts were successful, but most experiments failed due to different reasons, including stress and reduced time in the wild. In 1999, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) published a report called \\"African Rhino: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan.\\" This report recommended that all surviving specimens of the Western Black Rhino should be captured and placed in a specific region of modern Cameroon, in order to facilitate monitoring and reduce the attack rates of poachers. This experiment failed due to corruption. It demanded a large amount of money, and the risk of failure was very high. Western Black Rhinos were conserved in National Conservative parks, which did not halt their extinction. To monitor and protect white rhinos, WWF focuses on better-integrated intelligence gathering networks on rhino poaching and trade, more antipoaching patrols and better-equipped conservation law enforcement officers. WWF is setting up an Africa-wide rhino database using rhino horn DNA analysis (RhoDIS), which contributes to forensic investigations at the scene of the crime and for court evidence to greatly strengthen prosecution cases. WWF supports accredited training in environmental and crime courses, some of which have been adopted by South Africa Wildlife College. Special prosecutors have been appointed in countries like Kenya and South Africa to prosecute rhino crimes in a bid to deal with the mounting arrests and bring criminals to face swift justice with commensurate penalties.  Traditional Chinese medicine  In the 1950s, Mao Zedong effectively encouraged traditional Chinese medicine in an attempt to counter Western influences. While attempting to modernize this industry, several species were hunted. According to the official data published by the SATCM, 11,146 botanical and 1,581 zoological species, as well as 80 minerals were used. The Western Black Rhino was also hunted due to the value of its horn, which was believed to have the power to cure specific ailments and to be effective at detecting poisons (due to its high alkaline content). Price for horns could be high, for example 1 kg of horn could cost more than 50,000 US dollars, and the extinction of the species only increases the rarity and value of the horn.  Other uses for the horn  Rhino horns were used in making ceremonial knife handles called \\"Janbiya\\". The hilt type known as saifani uses rhinoceros horn as material and is a symbol of wealth and status due to its cost. In modern times, horns of other rhinoceros species are very valuable and can cost up to $100,000 per kg in places of high demand (e.g. Vietnam). An average horn may weigh between 1 and 3 kg. While locally respected doctors in Vietnam vouch for the rhino horns' cancer-curing properties, there is no scientific evidence for this or any other imputed medical property of the horns.

Biography Born in Buenos Aires, he initially studied law, but abandoned his studies in favor of politics. In 1839, no sooner had he begun to make a name for himself than he was arrested for his opposition to Argentina's conservative caudillo, Juan Manuel de Rosas. He was held in irons for six days. A year and a half later, the political climate spurred him, as it had many other Argentine dissenters, to flee the country. He found passage to Montevideo on a French schooner. He was welcomed by other exiles, among them Juan Bautista Alberdi, Florencio Varela, Esteban Echeverr√≠a, Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez, and Miguel Can√©. Three years later, the siege of Montevideo by Rosas's ally Manuel Oribe led M√°rmol to flee yet again, this time to Rio de Janeiro. Here he remained until February 1843, at which point he boarded a ship for Chile. The ship encountered fierce storms and was eventually forced to return to Rio de Janeiro. He remained in the city another two years before returning to Montevideo, where he spent the next seven years. The fall of Rosas after his defeat at the Battle of Caseros (1852) allowed M√°rmol to return to Argentina. After an exile that had lasted thirteen years, he was elected a senator and later a national deputy from the province of Buenos Aires. The secession of Buenos Aires from the Argentine Confederation prevented him from serving as plenipotentiary to Chile, a post to which he had been appointed. However, he later served as plenipotentiary to Brazil. In 1858Biblioteca Nacional he became director of the Biblioteca Nacional de la Rep√∫blica Argentina, until blindness forced him to retire. He died in Buenos Aires in 1871. By coincidence, his two most notable successors in the office of chief librarian, Paul Groussac and Jorge Luis Borges, also suffered from blindness in their old age.  Work  During his time in Montevideo, M√°rmol founded three journals, most notable among them being La Semana, and he contributed to many others. He earned a reputation as a passionate critic of Rosas and his supporters, and the sobriquet el verdugo po√©tico de Rosas (\\"the poetic hangman of Rosas\\"). In fact, his best known poem, A Rosas, el 25 de Mayo de 1843 (To Rosas, 25 May 1843), composed of alexandrine lines, is a vivid, fierce invective against the dictator. Abusive political content is indeed not absent from his work, whatever the genre. Also characteristic of M√°rmol are his unique descriptive sensibility and his treatment of love. In Uruguay in 1847 he published six of what would eventually be twelve cantos of El Peregrino (\\"The Pilgrim\\"), a long autobiographical poem set to the rhythm of his changing fortunes, which drew heavily from Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. His lyric poems were collected into Armon√≠as (Montevideo, 1851). In 1844 he published the first part of his semi-autobiographical Costumbrist novel Amalia, whose second part would not appear until his return to Buenos Aires years later. In 1914, Amalia was adapted into the first full-length Argentine film. M√°rmol's works for the stage were El Poeta (1847) and El Cruzado (1851). His style shows the influence of many Romanticists, not only Byron but also Chateaubriand, Jos√© de Espronceda, and Jos√© Zorrilla.

The building at 13th and Ohio was completely torn down in July 2013. History Brazil, Indiana's first radio station went on the air in 1958 as WITE, with a 3-tower directional antenna. In 1972, the AM station reverted to a daytime-only station with one tower, and the call letters, WWCM. This coincided with the construction of FM station WWCM at 97.7 that same year. The FM station originally operated with 3,000 watts at 97.7 MHz when it signed on in 1972 as WWCM-FM, playing country music. The format changed to album rock in 1979 as WBDJ. However, both WBDJ and its AM sister (1130 WWCM, now WAMB) went silent in 1983 after their owners declared bankruptcy. The stations were sold in 1985 to Mark Lange of Vincennes, Indiana, and returned to the air with new call letters and formats. 97.7 FM adopted the WSDM calls and an adult contemporary format, which was soon dropped to simulcast with the country format of its AM sister (by then known as WBZL; it became WSDM in 1990 and WSDX in 2000). The FM's power was doubled to 6,000 watts in 1989. WBZL and WSDM were sold in 1990 to Dan Lacy and Mike Petersen (under the name Equity One Media Partners), and on Halloween of that year, WSDM-FM switched format to oldies, utilizing ABC/SMN's Pure Gold satellite service. The WSDM stations were destroyed by a deliberately set fire on November 22, 1996; the arsonist was immediately apprehended and later sentenced to 18 years in prison. Wisdom 98 was back on the air by the end of the month, although WSDM (AM) remained off the air until the following April. 1998 brought more changes for WSDM-AM-FM, as Dan Lacy and Mike Petersen bought out their fellow shareholders in Equity One Media Partners, creating Crossroads Communications, Inc., and the stations' main offices were moved from Brazil to Terre Haute.

The victory was July's third OSL title, which won him the Golden Mouse, a prestigious achievement held previously only by Lee Yun-Yeol (NaDa). As of September 10, 2010 he has not renewed his contract with STX_SouL and has announced that he will be moving to the StarCraft 2 scene in a new team and will continue to play as Zerg.July officially announces his move to Starcraft 2 And on November 10, July has qualified for the GSL Pre-Season 3.  Starcraft II  Sung-joon in 2011 On September 15, 2010, the name of this new team has been revealed as STARTALE. Park Sung-joon qualified for Code A during GSL season 3 after making it to the RO16, but there losing to oGsMC (Jang Min-Chul, that season's GSL winner). GSL January was a successful season for ST_July, as he was able to make it past OdinMVP as well as \`Slayers\`Yugioh, only to lose to ZenexByun during the Code A Ro8. As a result of this success, he was a participant in the up and down matches following the end of the tournament. The up and down matches allow deserving Code A players the chance to be promoted to Code S, and allows undeserving Code S players to be demoted back down to Code A. Park Sung-joon initially faltered in his performance against ZenexKyrix (ZvZ), but rallied back in his second match against TSL_Rain (ZvT), which allowed him entry into Code S. Following the up and down matches, players from Code S were allowed, based on performance, to choose their grouping for GSL March (GSL February was dedicated to the team league). ST_July somewhat controversially chose to be in Group A (the group of death as it was later dubbed), calling out Season 3 winner oGsMC for having been defeated by him in previously mentioned Season 3 Ro8. In the process, he managed to put himself in the same group as two previous GSL winners. oGsHyperDub was also in this group. On February 22, at 18:45, ST_July faced oGsMC in the Code S round of 32 for Group A. ST_July was defeated, and as per schedule, immediately faced IMMvp, widely accepted as the best Starcraft II player in the world because he has the highest win percentage in every matchup (TvT, TvZ, TvP). IMMvP was also the winner of the most recent GSL season, further solidifying his position as the best in the world. A loss to IMMvP would remove him from the tournament, and risk his Code S status. ST_July defeated IMMvP, improving his record to 1-1 for the series and guaranteeing that, although he might not advance, he would not be subject to the up and down matches (which would jeopardize his position in Code S). The next match between oGsMC (the winner of match 2) and oGsHyperDub (the loser of match 1) would determine whether or ST_July would rematch IMMvP to determine who advances, or whether everyone would be tied 1-1 and July would be playing oGsHyperDub. oGsMC went on to defeat HyperDub to knock him into up and down/matches, and himself advance, thus setting up a rematch with IMMvP and ST_July. ST_July defeated IMMvP a second time, improving his record to 2-1 for the series, advancing to the Ro16, and putting IMMvP's status as the best current Starcraft 2 player in jeopardy. He went on to face Lee Yun-Yeol (aka oGsNada), in the Round of 8, defeating him 3-2 and advancing to the semi- finals. ST_July took the first two games really convincingly, lost the next two due to oGsNada's impressive defense, to finally win the fifth one thanks to amazing mutalisk micro and constant aggression. ST_July reached the Code S finals of the GSL season March. He was defeated by former Code S champion oGsMC in a best of seven format, losing 4-1.

Norworth was heard on the Acousticon Hour in March 1928. Acousticon Hour was a \\"musicale\\" radio program aired during 1927 and 1928 on NBC. It offered selections from classical music, orchestral favorites, operas and operettas. History The show was sponsored by the company that marketed the Acousticon brand hearing aid, invented by Miller Reese Hutchison. As broadcast historian Elizabeth McLeod has noted, in the 1920s a product name used in a show's title was considered a more acceptable form of advertising than the use of intrusive commercial messages: :The most popular program format of the late twenties was the sponsored musical feature. It could be a large symphonic group, a dance orchestra, or a song-and-patter team ‚Äî and it would usually carry the sponsor's name. The A&P; Gypsies, for example ‚Äî a large, genre-crossing orchestra conducted by Harry Horlick. The Ipana Troubadors ‚Äî a hot dance band directed by Sam Lanin. The Goodrich Zippers ‚Äî a banjo-driven orchestra conducted by Harry Reser, when he wasn't leading the same group under the name of The Clicquot Club Eskimos. Everyone remembers The Happiness Boys, Billy Jones and Ernie Hare -- but what about Scrappy Lambert and Billy Hillpot, who performed exactly the same sort of material as Trade and Mark, The Smith Brothers. The list is endless: The Silvertown Cord Orchestra, featuring the Silver Masked Tenor. The Sylvania Foresters. The Flit Soldiers -- yet another Harry Reser group. The Champion Sparkers. The Fox Fur Trappers. The Ingram Shavers, who were the Ipana Troubadours on alternate Wednesdays. The Yeast Foamers. The Planters Pickers. And, the magnificently named Freed-Eisemann Orchestradians. All playing pretty much the same sorts of music, all announced by Phillips Carlin or John S. Young or Alwyn Bach or Milton Cross in pretty much the same sort of stiffly formal style.McLeod, Elizabeth. \\"Radio's Forgotten Years\\" The Acousticon Hour was not a 60-minute show as the title suggests. It was a 30-minute program which NBC broadcast from 5:30 to 6 p.m. on Sunday afternoons. In 1928, the Acousticon male quartet sang \\"The Palms\\" in recognition of Palm Sunday. The singer-songwriter Jack Norworth was a guest in March 1928, and the pianist- songwriter Jean Schwartz appeared as a guest the following month. Selections from the operas Carmen and La Gioconda were included in the April 1928 schedule. Jack Burton was the program's announcer, director, and writer. Performers who made their network premieres on the show included Lina Abarbanell, Donald Brian, Shelton Brooks, Victor Moore, Jack Norworth, Blanche Ring, Julia Sanderson, Jean Schwartz, Six Brown Brothers, and Sophie Tucker.

He was portrayed by actor Michael Park from April 1, 1997 until the final episode on September 17, 2010. Character history Jack Snyder came to Oakdale in 1997 to investigate James Stenbeck. After helping to put Stenbeck behind bars, he decided to stay in town and got a job at the Oakdale PD. Jack also got reacquainted with his family and helped his cousin, Holden Snyder, in the search for his daughter. Not long after arriving in town, Jack went with Holden to Montana. There he met his rival, Carly Tenney. Jack and Carly didn't get along at first; in fact they couldn't stand each other. However, despite all their arguing, there was much chemistry between them. Their true feelings for each other became apparent when they investigated arsonist/dirty cop Teague. During the investigation, Jack and Carly got trapped in a cabin where they grew closer and discovered that they had feelings for one another. After returning to Oakdale, Jack wanted to continue the relationship slowly; however Carly was desperate to get married and she dumped Jack to marry Hal Munson. Reeling from his breakup with Carly, Jack was all set to leave town when he met Julia Lindsey. While helping Julia escape from her controlling fianc√©, he fell in love with her. In the meantime, Jack found out the truth about Carly's marriage to Hal‚Äîshe would inherit a huge trust fund from her sister, Rosanna Cabot, if she married a man and had a baby by him by the time the year was out. Disgusted, Jack told Carly to come clean with Hal or he'd completely walk out of her life. In the end, Hal learned the truth himself and divorced her. Luckily for Carly, she got Dr. John Dixon (who she thought impregnated her with donated sperm) to marry her and, soon after, with the assistance of Jack and Julia, she gave birth to a son, Parker in December 1998. Soon after, Jack's relationship with Julia ended when he learned that she lied to him about killing David Stenbeck, and also because of interference from Carly. Even though Jack tried to avoid Carly and deny his feelings for her, something about her kept pulling him back. Eventually, long buried feelings rose to the surface and they made love. He dumped Carly again, soon after, when he found out that she lied about her son's paternity, Hal not John was the baby's father. On one occasion, Carly was kidnapped and taken to another country. Jack fought to find her and get her back. She was given a serum that would age her quickly, so by the time she was rescued she had aged quite a bit. But that didn't stop Jack, who held a reluctant Carly in his arms, caring for what was inside more than out. Carly wasn't so embarrassed and let Jack love her. Eventually, Carly was given a reverse serum that brought her looks back to where they were when she left. Jack treated her no different, and she felt safe and secure in his arms. The night before Jack and Carly were going to get married, they had a huge argument over her relationship with Craig Montgomery. Jack didn't approve of them spending so much time together. Carly was angry when she left, and went to her office and started drinking to calm herself. Mike Kasnoff showed up while Carly was drinking. As they sat there and talked, Carly found comfort in Mike's arms. They made love. The next day, Jack and Carly made up but she never told him about the affair - until she had to. Carly found herself pregnant, but she wasn't sure if it was Mike's baby or Jack's. She went to Montana to get away. Jack followed her, just in time to help with the birth. Carly had a little girl who she named Sage. They renewed their vows and found out later that Sage was Jack's. Carly's cousin Molly Conlan was in town. She had a mobster chasing her. When he was caught at Jack and Carly's house, Jack came to arrest him. He called for back up, but Molly was so upset at his presence that she insisted that Jack take him out of the house. Jack decided to take him in his car. Carly begged him not to, but he couldn't bear to see Molly upset. On the way to the police department, Jack's car went over the bridge. Jack's body was not in the car. Everyone gave up on the search eventually, but not Carly. She searched until she found Jack. He had amnesia and was married to a woman who was the nurse who took care of him in the hospital. Julia had a son named JJ and they were one big happy family. Carly got Jack to come back to Oakdale, and once he was there, she had him court ordered to live with her instead of Julia. Jack was torn. He finally got his memory back and let Julia down easy. She sought comfort in his cousin, Holden. Carly and Jack were glad to have things back to normal. Tragically, Julia was killed by her ex-husband and JJ was awarded to Jack, since he was the only \\"real dad\\" he knew. Jack and Carly finally divorced in 2006, and after grieving for a while, Carly found herself falling in love with Simon Frasier. The two got into trouble and Jack had to arrest them both. After a struggle, Simon and Carly got away, and Jack took the kids to the farm to stay. Jack and Katie began dating and he quickly fell for the bubbly blonde. Carly returned to town, putting a wrench in the works and then JJ was kidnapped. Together, Jack and Carly tracked down JJ and brought him home; along the way, Jack began having feelings for Carly again. Nearly unconscious after an explosion, he said, \\"I love you, Carly,\\" within Katie's hearing (Carly wasn't there). When they returned to Oakdale, Jack decided to put the past behind him and proposed to Katie! Katie accepted and Jack rushed the wedding forward and they were married in a few days. Just after the wedding, Jack got devastating news: Carly was dying from a brain lesion! He put his life - and his honeymoon - on hold to care for her! Jack was falling for Carly again and asked her to marry him. On the day of their wedding, Carly told him that she was misdiagnosed and had lied about it. He left her at the altar but it was too late to save his relationship with Katie. He took the kids from Carly and tried to leave her in his past. Janet Ciccone arrived in town and began an affair with Jack. The closer they got, though, the more Jack realized his feelings for Carly weren't in the past. Around this time he learned of Carly's affair with Holden and was livid. Rather than focus on Carly, though, Jack tried to save Parker from a bad relationship with Liberty Ciccone - and a livid Brad! When Brad accused Parker of raping Liberty, Jack and Carly pulled together to clear their son. At Alison and Aaron's wedding, Jack and Carly talked about the past but neither could admit they still had feelings for one another. Janet realized that Jack's feelings weren't in the past and moved out of the farm.

It was invented by Ralphe Wiggins and produced by the Ryan Corp, later Information Harvesting Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts.Marc Myers, \\"For Information Harvesting, the Future is Now\\" Network World May 22, 1995. p.42 Accessed Dec. 4, 2019. Wiggins had a background in genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic. IH sought to infer rules from sets of data. It did this first by classifying various input variables into one of a number of bins, thereby putting some structure on the continuous variables in the input. IH then proceeds to generate rules, trading off generalization against memorization, that will infer the value of the prediction variable, possibly creating many levels of rules in the process. It included strategies for checking if overfitting took place and, if so, correcting for it. Because of its strategies for correcting for overfitting by considering more data, and refining the rules based on that data, IH might also be considered to be a form of machine learning. The advantage of IH, as compared with other data mining products of its time and even later, was that it provided a mechanism for finding multiple rules that would classify the data and determining, according to set criteria, the best rules to use.

It has been identified as related, though in some cases distinct, to Canadian nationalism.Eva Gruber. Thomas King: Works and Impact. Pp. 143-144. In contemporary times, this patriotism has commonly emphasized Canada as a multicultural cosmopolitan society.\\"Cosmopolitanism and Patriotism\\" by Kok-Chor Tan. Will Kymlicka, Kathryn Walker. Rooted Cosmopolitanism: Canada and the World. UBC Press, 2012. Pp. 44. History Canada's first Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald worked with George-√âtienne Cartier and other representatives, in founding the country, in which Canada was recognized as having been created by 'two founding races' which the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism later defined as 'Canadians of British and French origin' apart from 'the other ethnic groups' to the explicit exclusion of 'the Indians and the Eskimos' in its Book I. General Introduction, Paragraph 21, often referred to today as English Canadians and French Canadians.Alan Ware. Democracy and North America. Routledge, 1996. Pp. 32. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier in his 1911 electoral defeat speech, responded to various accusations by asserting his support for Canadianism, saying: Canadianism was especially important within the Liberal Party of Canada, Liberal Party figures such as O. D. Skelton neither rejected ties between Canada and United Kingdom, nor claimed that Canadians composed a unitary nation - taking into account rejections of this by French Canadian supporters of a Canadian patriotism, such as Henri Bourassa.Remaking Liberalism: The Intellectual Legacy of Adam Shortt, O.D. Skelton, W.C. Clark, and W.A. Mackintosh, 1890-1925. McGill-Queens, 1993. Pp. 152. Pierre Elliot Trudeau, as Prime Minister of Canada sought to develop a common Canadianism across cultural boundaries through advancing a Canadian society based upon civic rights, as manifested with the adoption of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Paul R. Magocsi, Multicultural History Society of Ontario. Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples. Toronto, Ontario, Canada: University of Toronto Press, 1999. Pp. 322. Trudeau emphasized Canada as being a multicultural society, his vision of multiculturalism was individualist in associating cultural identity with individual choice.Shall We Dance?: A Patriotic Politics for Canada. McGill-Queen's University Press. Pp. 52. The version of patriotism promoted by the Liberal Party that sought to distance Canada from the United Kingdom was initially strongly opposed by the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC). Prime Minister John Diefenbaker of the PC Party, emphasized Canadian nationalism, asserting that there was \\"One Canada, One Nation\\", believing that the goal of Macdonald and Cartier of unifying the people of Canada could be achieved.Christopher MacLennan. Toward the Charter: Canadians and the Demand for a National Bill of Rights, 1929-1960. McGill-Queen's University Press P. 122. Prior to becoming Prime Minister, Diefenbaker emphasized the need for Canadian identity to be reconcile unity and diversity, saying in 1946 during a debate in the House of Commons on citizenship: \\"Canada must develop, now that we achieve this citizenship, unity out of diversity...\\". In 1964, Diefenbaker rejected the then-proposed maple leaf flag for Canada by the Liberal government, because it held no reference to Britain and he claimed that did it honour the \\"founding races\\" of Canada, and demanded that any new flag have the British Union Jack and the emblems of the \\"founding races\\".Arthur Slade. John Diefenbaker. XYZ Publishing, 2001. Pp. 169. The PCs later accepted the current Canadian flag, with the red maple leaf appearing on the party's logo in the 1970s. In 1980, PC leader Joe Clark, during his short tenure as Prime Minister, added a new element to the description of Canada's identity, describing Canada as a \\"community of communities\\" - in that Canadians could express multiple identities within a Canadian identity. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Clark as Constitutional Affairs Minister attempted to resolve political disagreement with Quebec over the Constitution Act of 1982 through propositions of constitutional reform in the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. The successor to the PC Party, the Conservative Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper recognized the Qu√©b√©cois as a nation within a united Canada.Michael M. Brescia, John C. Super. North America: an introduction. Toronto, Ontario, Canada: University of Toronto Press, 2009. Pp. 72. Harper later elaborated that the motion's definition of Qu√©b√©cois relies on personal decisions to self-identify as Qu√©b√©cois, and therefore is a personal choice. The New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP) has influenced Canadian identity, particularly via former NDP leader and Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas who was identified in a major public opinion poll by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) as the \\"Greatest Canadian\\", largely due to his advocacy for publicly funded universal health care for medically necessary services that was eventually adopted by Canada.Vincent Lam. Extraordinary Canadians Tommy Douglas. Toronto, Ontario, Canada: Penguin Canada, 2011. P. 1.

In 2016, the town had a population of 640 people.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. It is on the Pacific Highway. The history of Broadwater has largely revolved around its sugar mill. In 1863 Henry Cook and Alexander MacDonald became the first people to select land in the area. To begin with, sugar was grown and crushed on the small private farms in the region. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) opened the town's sugar mill in 1880. In the early days sugar cane was grown as far up the Richmond River as the town of Bexhill and was carried to the mill on punts. In 1978 CSR sold the mill to the newly formed New South Wales Sugar Milling Cooperative, which established its head office at Broadwater. Today Broadwater is the centre of the region's highly mechanised sugar industry, which is still a major employer. In recent years the area has also seen an influx of new settlers, attracted by its peaceful rural lifestyle. The nearby Riley's Hill Dock began operation in the late 19th century and many punts, river boats and larger vessels were built in the dry dock there. One of its last major jobs was the restoration of the Sydney Harbour ferry South Steyne in the 1980s. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 640 people in Broadwater. 86.4% of people were born in Australia and 91.2% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.4%, Catholic 23.8% and Anglican 19.2%.

She was originally portrayed by Alexandra Chando, who portrayed the role from July 27, 2005, to October 26, 2007, and by Kelli Barrett from December 22, 2008, to January 5, 2009. Alexandra Chando returned to the show as Maddie on September 23, 2009. She is the youngest in a family of eight children. Her older brother Henry Coleman is her best friend and was the only person who paid attention to her while she was growing up. Character history Maddie has no friends at the summer of 2005. Henry picks her up, assuming she's only there for one night. However, Maddie makes it clear that she intends to stay in Oakdale for a while and asks if she can stay with him and his wife Katie. However, Maddie does not know that Henry's marriage to Katie wasn't out of love and he didn't tell her yet that Katie and him got divorced. Maddie soon meets Mike Kasnoff, Katie's new boyfriend and the reason she and Henry got married in the first place; to make Mike jealous. Maddie doesn't like Mike and intends on bringing her brother and Katie back together again. Katie tries to find a place for Maddie to stay, because Katie now lives with Mike and doesn't want Maddie around. She asks her sister, Margo and she agrees, Maddie can stay with her. Maddie meets with Margo's son Casey and the two take an instant dislike to each other. They're not happy on living under the same roof and try to undo the decision. Meanwhile, Maddie discovers a man named Byron Glass on Katie's old high school picture, and tries to get in touch with him, so he can break up Katie and Mike. At the same time, Katie's new boss BJ starts showing an interest in Katie and Maddie wonders if she should stop contacting Byron, since BJ is now in the picture. Henry discovers Maddie's plan and makes her break the contact with Byron. Not much later, BJ becomes obsessed with Katie and Maddie begins to put some pieces together and realizes BJ is actually Byron. Henry discovers it at the same time and confronts BJ, who locks him up in his cellar. Maddie worries over her brother, who she hasn't seen for a while and Casey starts to pick up on that. When she confides in him, he decides to help her and the two sniffle around in BJ's office to find prove of his lies. The two start to get deeper into their investigation, until BJ realizes what they're doing and he sets a trap, a bomb in the WOAK station, where a contest is going on at the time. Henry is able to free himself in the meantime and he hurries to the station, where the bomb goes off. Everyone gets out alright, but BJ escapes. Margo sets up an investigation and swears to hunt down the person who ever got BJ to Oakdale, who in fact was Maddie. She once again asks Casey for help and the two steal evidence and plant fake ones, and the investigation is eventually closed. Maddie does go over to Katie to confess what she has done, but Katie forgives her. Because of the whole event, Maddie and Casey have gotten closer, now building a close friendship which is often confused with more by other people. When Casey's one-night stand Gwen and his ex-best friend Will Munson go on the run, he tries to help his mother in finding them, still angry with them because of everything that happened between them. Maddie, at the same time, stumbles on the pair and decides to help them and hides them in the closed nightclub Metro. When she hears that Gwen is falsely accused by Will's mother Barbara Ryan, she plants fake evidence so the cops won't look at Metro. Casey soon discovers what Maddie is up to and intends to go to the cops. Maddie convinces him not to and he helps Gwen and Will being safe. However, the cops still find out soon and Margo brings Gwen and Will downtown, where Gwen is charged with assault on Barbara. Maddie and Casey find evidence that Gwen didn't do it and Gwen is cleared. This has brought Maddie and Casey even closer and the two start a tumultuous relationship, which isn't approved by Margo. She eventually kicks Maddie out, unable to let her son live under the same roof as his girlfriend, afraid he will once again knock someone up. Maddie and Casey continue to see each other and both Gwen and Will are surprised several times by how Casey has changed for Maddie. One night, Maddie and Casey prepare to sleep with each other for the first time, when both Margo and Tom are out of town. When Maddie arrives at Casey's, she runs into a new cop, Dallas Griffin. The two seem to know each other, but only share a brief conversation, after which Maddie is spooked. She is unable to make love to Casey and breaks up with him. In the days after, she starts having flashbacks to something that happened to her in the past, something she can't clearly remember. She tries to confide in Henry, but they're cut off several times. She is hurt when Casey gets a new girlfriend, though she doesn't know Casey only does that so he won't have to deal with the pain of losing Maddie. Maddie becomes violent towards Lia, Casey's girlfriend and shows this by threatening Lia. When Lia is found dead a few days later, people point to Maddie as the prime suspect and Maddie is arrested. Her sister Eve has come to Oakdale and Maddie remembers what happened to her; she was raped by Louis, Eve's husband. Maddie confides in Henry, Eve, Margo and Dallas, who was the paroling officer the night Maddie was raped, but she leaves out the part that Louis raped her, and she makes up a story about a frat party and a senior student. When another student is murdered later that week, Maddie is once again the prime suspect. However, when later Gwen is attacked, Maddie is released and she is attacked herself. Oakdale now deals with a serial killer and the cops have no idea who it is. Casey, Will and Gwen decide to take a road trip, away from all the things that are going on in Oakdale. Maddie follows them to Raven Lake, and so do a few other teenagers. Their trip proves to be a horrible and fatal mistake when the Slasher follows them and starts killing the teenagers one by one at night. Having no contact with their parents, who have no idea what's going on, the teenagers are cut from the outside world and have to survive on their own. Maddie finally tells Casey what happened to her and he keeps her with him, trying to protect her against the Slasher, only to be killed himself. Maddie continues her way in an attempt to find her friends. When she runs into Louis, who was the next prime suspect, she's convinced he's the killer. However, he tries to confess something to her, but is stabbed and killed from behind by the real Slasher. In Oakdale, the parents and cops have realized what is going on at Raven Lake and they head over, stumbling over the many bodies that are left behind. Maddie faces her attacker and is about to be killed when Casey rescues her, showing he didn't actually die. He knocks the Slasher unconscious and Maddie takes of his mask, revealing that the Slasher in no other than her sister Eve. The teenagers who survived are found by the cops and Eve is arrested. Her motive for killing the teenagers and blaming Maddie for it was the fact that Louis raped Maddie. Eve turned it around and saw it as Maddie seducing Louis. After a few sessions of therapy and long conversations, Maddie and Casey make up and start their relationship again. With his help, she is slowly able to give everything a place and move on with her life. She is surprised when Casey starts buying her expensive gifts and wonders where he got the money from. He claims to have gotten a better job and at first, Maddie believes him. However, she soon starts to recognize the sign that Henry and her own mother had and she realizes that Casey, just like Henry and her mother, is gambling. She confronts him and he tells her he will stop gambling. He doesn't though, and Maddie once again begs him to stop. Suddenly, Will's trust fund is stolen and Will himself is blamed for it. Maddie puts the pieces together and discovers that Casey stole the bonds, but Adam, his brother, set Will up, in order to get Will's wife Gwen. Casey is arrested and Adam flees town. Angry that he won't help Casey out, Maddie follows Gwen to the woods, who was asked by Adam to come there. When she sees Adam trying to kiss Gwen, she panics, getting flashbacks to her own rape. She grabs a branch and hits Adam on the back of his head, after which he falls down and doesn't breathe anymore. Gwen decides to bury Adam, because Margo will never forgive Maddie if she finds out what she did to her son. However, Gwen starts to get anonymous gifts and even finds the branch in her bed one time. Convinced that Adam might still be alive, she fills in Will and they want to escape Oakdale with Maddie. Maddie breaks things off with Casey, unable to lie to him after what she has done to his brother. She and Will and Gwen are about to leave town when Casey shows up, who finds out what they did. He assures Maddie he isn't mad and they make up. They're soon attacked by Adam, who is still alive, and wants revenge on the girls. Maddie knocked out and the boys are locked up. They break free in time to help Maddie and stop Adam from raping Gwen. They make Adam leave town and the four return home. However, Maddie and Casey both know what will happen now. Casey left town on bail and is now also charged with attempt to escape. He is convicted to six months prison. He and Maddie try to make the best of the little time they have, and finally make love to each other. A few days later, it is time and Casey leaves for prison. Maddie keeps in touch with him and sends him video messages and updates of everything. However, three months after being sent to jail, Casey sends Maddie a letter where he breaks up with her. He feels unworthy of being her boyfriend and also explains he won't come back to Oakdale after being released. Maddie is heartbroken and confides in Luke Snyder, a new friend with whom she is interns at WOAK. They meet Noah, another intern, and along with Will and Gwen, they decide to go to Branson for the weekend. Maddie confides in Noah about her heartache and the two end up in bed together. Back in Oakdale, they decide to start a relationship, often rushed by Noah when he tries to prove to his father that he loves Maddie. Maddie soon finds out that Noah is actually in love with Luke, who is also gay. Though she feels betrayed, she wishes them the best and even stands up to Noah's homophobic father. Before he was sentenced to prison, Casey secretly submitted an application to Wesleyan University on Maddie's behalf. A few weeks later, Maddie receives her acceptance letter from Wesleyan. She had planned to attend the University ‚Äî because it had been \\"a dream of mine since I knew what college was.\\" Maddie now has doubts about going off to Wesleyan, but eventually comes to the decision to move on with her life and become the collegiate straight A student Casey always told her she would become. She says goodbye to her brother and friends, and leaves Oakdale to start at Wesleyan. On December 22, 2008, Maddie returns to Oakdale just in time for Christmas, surprising Casey at the Hughes family home. Despite Casey's insistence that she is far better off without him in her life, Maddie refuses to listen to him. However, when Alison arrives, Maddie becomes uncomfortable and runs off. Later on, Maddie comes across Noah and Luke, to whom she explains that she's returned to town after breaking things off with her boyfriend at Wesleyan. Maddie and Noah continue to talk, deeply upsetting Luke. Meanwhile, Alison attempts to convince Casey that Maddie's return may be destiny, but he refuses to listen to Alison, out of fear he may hurt Maddie again. When Ali and Margo finally manage to convince Casey to ask Maddie as his date on New Year's Eve, Casey can't keep his mind off of Alison, and leaves Maddie to sleep with Ali. Maddie, hurt by his betrayal, leaves Oakdale not much later. On September 23, 2009, Alison calls Maddie and asks her to return to Oakdale to help out Adam, who has returned as well and will go to jail for assaulting Gwen and Maddie, unless Maddie testifies and drops the charges. Maddie agrees and comes back, and Casey becomes furious when he sees Adam and Maddie in the same room and warns his brother to stay away from Maddie. A few days later, Alison breaks up with Casey, believing it's for the best, and Maddie and Casey pick up their close bond from years ago. She's there to support Casey when his uncle Brad dies and joins him at the funeral. When Maddie asks Casey if they're getting back together, and if so, should she take a leave of absence at Wesleyan, Casey agrees they are a couple again. Excited, Maddie starts making plans, not knowing Casey is partly using their newfound love to make Alison jealous. Maddie soon realizes whats happened, but she and Casey remain friends, although not as close. Maddie starts writing a blog and starts a friendship with Hunter, although she gets frustrated with him at first, they become closer. She spends her last days in Oakdale helping Noah. She plans to be roommates with him on her last day onscreen. On March 3, 2010, it was mentioned that Maddie returned to Wesleyan messing up plans with being roommates with Noah.

The primary work done in the area is the manufacturing of steel, and the port area is dominated by steel mills. The port is divided between the municipalities of Burns Harbor and Portage. Construction of the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor was extremely controversial, with conservationists fighting to preserve a segment of the Indiana Dunes that occupied the site of the future port.Smith, S. & Mark, S. (2009). The Historical Roots of the Nature Conservancy in the Northwest Indiana/Chicagoland Region: From Science to Preservation. The South Shore Journal, 3. Smith, S. & Mark, S. (2006).

The port and its steel mills were constructed on top of what was once the Central Dunes region of the Indiana Dunes and site of some of the hanggliding experiments carried out by a crew led by pioneer aviator Octave Chanute. Authorization of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, which borders the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor on three sides, was part of a political compromise that also involved the construction of the port. Port economy The Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor, as of 2015, is dominated by three extensive industrial plants: * Gary Works-Midwest Plant, a unit of the U.S. Steel Corporation. * The Burns Harbor works of ArcelorMittal, originally constructed by the former Bethlehem Steel Corporation. not to be confused with ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor works, located in East Chicago. * The Northern Indiana Public Service Bailly coal-fired power plant owned by NiSource. Port history When Bethlehem Steel and advocates for preservation of the Central Dunes crossed swords in Congress in the early 1960s, the steel company won. Two key arguments used by Bethlehem in their successful campaign were increased national security from the production of American steel, and the creation of well-paid jobs in a field that was then dominated by the United Steelworkers union. Two arguments advanced by the people opposed to the project were that the mill could have easily been located directly east of Gary, in a less sensitive and strategic ecological zone, and that large infrastructure projects, which would amount to a tax subsidy, were needed to construct a mill in this area. Making steel in the Burns Harbor area required support from the federal government because of the shallow waters of Lake Michigan offshore from the sand dunes. In order to make it possible for lake freighters to bring iron ore, coal, and limestone to the steel mills, extensive dredging and engineering work was necessary. This work linked the Little Calumet River to Lake Michigan via Burns Ditch. Congress, as part of the River and Harbor Act of 1965, instructed the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out the necessary work to create and maintain the artificial harbor that would become the Port of Indiana. In line with overall Great Lakes standards, the docking areas are dredged to a depth of at least 27 feet (8 m). The port is protected by 8,230 feet (2,510 m) of steel and rubblemound breakwaters. In addition to the federal help, the state of Indiana showed its support for the Port of Indiana project by constructing two roads, Indiana 149 and Indiana 249, to serve the new industrial area. Port recreational use The Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor also contains the Burns Waterway Small Boat Harbor, a -long canal, dredged to a depth of 6 feet (1.8 m), extending inland from Lake Michigan to south of U.S. Highway 12. It is located west of Burns Waterway Harbor, at . This boat harbor provides access to the inland Portage Marina and Marina Shores, a private, 300-boat marina/condominium complex under development as of 2011. The marina is successful, but the housing development failed in the early stages of development. Other than the small boat harbor, much of the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor is a \\"restricted area\\" as of 2019, and the public is not admitted within most of the port area. Port incidents The joint use of the Port of Indiana for industrial and recreational purposes has led to incidents. In August 2019, ArcelorMittal inadvertently vented elevated levels of ammonia and cyanide from a Burns Harbor blast furnace into the Little Calumet River. Hundreds of fish were killed. Elements of the Port of Indiana public infrastructure, including the river and adjacent boardwalk, were temporarily closed to the public.

In 1983 he was convicted of poisoning 22 patients and sentenced to 21 years in prison. He served 12 years and 10 years supervision, and is thought to be living under an assumed name. Early life Born in Tr√∏ndelag, Norway in 1936 out of wedlock, Nesset was raised by his mother and remained with her throughout his upbringing and adulthood, living at her childhood home. His father was absent from his life and he never established contact with him. He was educated as a registered nurse and by 1977 he was hired as a head nurse at a larger nursing home in Orkdal municipality. Crimes During the summer and autumn of 1981, a series of suspicious deaths was uncovered at the nursing home in Orkdal, S√∏r- Tr√∏ndelag where Nesset was working as manager. When questioned by police, Arnfinn Nesset initially confessed to the murders of 27 patients who he claimed to have killed by injecting them with suxamethonium chloride, a muscle relaxing drug. He was charged with 25 counts of homicide, but later retracted his confession and denied all charges throughout the rest of his five-month- long trial. Nesset was convicted in March 1983 of poisoning 22 patients with suxamethonium chloride. He was also convicted of one count of attempted murder and acquitted on two other counts. Nesset may have killed as many as 138 of his patients. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum term available under Norwegian law at the time, to be followed by ten years of preventative detention. However he was released after serving 12 years of this sentence for good behaviour and 10 years supervision, is now reported to be living in an undisclosed location under an assumed name. The chief prosecutor at his trial, Olaf Jakhelln described Nesset as \\"an ambitious man, who wanted complete control over life and death [of his victims].\\" See also *Dr. John Bodkin Adams *Dr. Harold Shipman *Stephan Letter *List of serial killers by country References Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian nurses Category:Norwegian serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Poisoners Category:Nurses convicted of killing patients Category:Norwegian people convicted of murder Category:Norwegian criminals Category:People convicted of murder by Norway ","title":"Arnfinn Nesset"},{"id":"7688435","text":"NHNZ logo NHNZ, formerly Natural History New Zealand is a New Zealand-based factual television production house creating original content for global broadcasters. NHNZ has filmed above and below every ocean and every continent, including Antarctica ‚Äì where it has produced 19 documentary films in total. The company has earned more than 300 international awards, among them two Emmy Awards, the television industry's highest accolade, and a prestigious Wildscreen Panda Award. In addition to its base in Dunedin, New Zealand, NHNZ has offices in Beijing and Washington DC and, majority ownership of Singapore- based production company Beach House Pictures and Aquavision Wildlife Filmmakers in South Africa. It works and co-produces with multiple major global broadcasters: Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, Discovery Science, A&E; Television Networks, National Geographic Channel, Travel Channel, NHK (Japan), France 5 and ZDF (Germany). As a result, NHNZ's programmes are seen in more than 180 countries by millions of viewers. History = The early years = NHNZ was originally formed as the Natural History Unit of TVNZ. The unit was created in 1977, with the aim of telling stories of New Zealand's most iconic and endangered species. In 2008, NHNZ celebrated 30 years of television production making it one of the world's longest standing production companies. The unit's first documentaries made were a series of six 15-minute programmes called Hidden Places which featured various New Zealand habitats, notably Okarito, White Island, Fiordland, Mackenzie Country and Sinclair Wetlands, near Dunedin. The first programme that captured international attention was the story of Don Merton's rescue of the New Zealand black robin from the brink of extinction. Several programmes were made chronicling this success story ‚Äì Seven Black Robins, The Robins Return and finally Chatham Island a Black Robin Story. For more detail about the origins of these early programmes see Morris & Smith.Wild South, Saving New Zealand‚Äôs Endangered Birds. Rod Morris & Hal Smith, TVNZ & Century Hutchinson NZ Ltd, Auckland. 1988 A focus on New Zealand stories continued during the 1980s and early 1990s, with children's series Wild Track and the series Wild South becoming cultural icons, still replayed in New Zealand today. In 1990 the company produced a series presented by David Bellamy, in association with the New Zealand Heritage Foundation, called Moa's Ark.Moa's Ark the Voyage of New Zealand. David Bellamy & Brian Springett. Penguin Books (Viking), Auckland. 1990 This was the first time NHNZ had worked with an international 'star'. In 1997 it was sold, and became a subsidiary of Fox International Channels.and an incorporated New Zealand Limited Company (New Zealand Companies Office registration number 884648) In October 2012, former Fox executive David Haslingden acquired 100% of NHNZ. =Focus areas=  Antarctica  NHNZ has been making documentaries in Antarctica for more than 25 years. The first, in 1982, featured the private life of Adelie penguins, paved the way for a further 18 titles. Icebird and Under the Ice were early offshore successes for the company, and were both produced by Neil Harraway. The pair of documentaries, Emperors of Antarctica and The Longest Night, chronicled the over-wintering activities of scientists from Antarctica New Zealand, produced by Max Quinn in 1992, were joined by a third Solid Water Liquid Rock produced by Mike Single. This trilogy helped to establish a relationship with Discovery Channel. Throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s, a string of documentaries were made by both Quinn and Single, while an exceptional icy dive team was led by Jeanie Ackley and Ed Jowett. Single won an Emmy for outstanding cinematography for The Crystal Ocean and Quinn completed his trilogy, Ice Worlds, cementing NHNZ's place as a leading documentary film maker in the inhospitable Antarctic. Underwater Filming A second area of expertise lies in underwater filming. Two major marine based series Deep Blue, and Shark Gordon were filmed at locations throughout the Pacific. Shark Gordon was made for Animal Planet, and featured shark specialist Ian Gordon. Whales Whales have also featured in many documentaries including The Lost Whales about the rejuvenation of the population of southern right whales in New Zealand's subantarctic islands, and Killers I Have Known about Dr Ingrid Visser's investigations into the life and habits of New Zealand orca. 3D In 2010 NHNZ started producing 3D factual programming. NHNZ's first 3D documentary China Revealed: The Great Wall of China debuted on one of the world's first full-time 3D networks -3net. In 2012, NHNZ announced it was taking a lead role in the development of cost- effective 2D to 3D conversion technology, in partnership with Korean company ETRI. ETRI will use NHNZ's HD documentaries as test subjects for trialling the new technology. =Successful series= NHNZ has made several successful series of programmes. Working with Animal Planet, the company made The Most Extreme, a series produced by Ian McGee. NHNZ produced 65 episodes of this series from 2002 to 2007. The show counted down the top ten animals on any given theme. The forerunner to The Most Extreme was Twisted Tales, two series produced in 1999 and 2000 which took a single animal group like The Frog or The Bat and focused on their relationship with people through time, and around the world. Twisted Tales: The Bat earned Ian McGee NHNZ's second Emmy Award in 1999 for Outstanding Achievement in a Craft in News and Documentary Programming ‚Äì Writers. The following year, Ian and co-writer Quinn Berentson were again nominated for an Emmy Award in the same category for Twisted Tales: The Rat. In 2008, NHNZ began a new series, I Survived..., which airs on the Biography Channel. The series is now up to episode 86, and has its own spinoff series, I Survived: Beyond and Back, which features people who have died and returned to life. Other successful series include Orangutan Island and Life Force. = Diversification = Over the years, NHNZ diversified its programming away from just natural history. It gradually expanded its genres to cover health (Kill or Cure series); science (X=Force the Science of ... series; Mega Disaster series); adventure (Adventure Central series); and people (Tribal Life series; The Diva Mummy). In Tuna Wranglers, NHNZ tested the waters of the current popularity of reality shows about the daily lives of blue-collar workers pitting themselves against nature in extreme environments. Engineering programmes have also proven popular with the company making a string of shows from Asia and China under the Man Made Marvels and MegaStructures banners. Archive footage ‚Äì NHNZ Moving Images In 2007 NHNZ established an Emerging Media team to maximise opportunities for either selling or re-versioning the company's footage for broadcast via a variety of platforms, including mobile phone clips and online video (Streaming media). Several years later it created NHNZ Moving Images, NHNZ's footage archive unit, and the company now sells footage from NHNZ programmes as well as outtakes and represents the work of about 30 internationally renowned filmmakers including storm shooter Geoff Mackley and Yusuf Thakur. In 2011 the unit signed a deal to represent National Geographic Channel's worldwide library of more than 20 years of accumulated footage from its blue-chip factual programming library, including hundreds of hours of HD footage. Other media In 2009, NHNZ started up a gaming division, Runaway, which has developed several video games, both for social media (Facebook), and mobile. Its successes include Flutter, a popular Facebook game that involved breeding butterflies and is associated with the World Wildlife Fund. It grew quickly to have more than 600,000 online players after being accredited by Facebook. Play online ceased in December 2011 to allow for new game development and Runaway announced in September 2012 on its blog that it had a mobile version of the game being tested and almost ready to be released. Runaway has also produced Howling Mouse, which has received positive reviews and Puzzle Planet, both in association with National Geographic Channel and available on the Apple App Store. Education In 2002, NHNZ entered into a partnership with the University of Otago, in Dunedin, New Zealand, to create a Masters in Science Communication, in Science and Natural History Film-making. The two-year course takes up to 12 students a year, and is based on a year of course work, and a year making a commercial-length documentary, in association with NHNZ. =China and Asia= NHNZ established an office in Beijing, China, in 2002, and is now the biggest outside producer of documentaries about the country.\\"Enter the dragon\\", Rebecca Macfie, 31 July 2010, The Listener Its relationship with China was recognised when it received a Business Excellence Award at the 2011 Cathay Pacific NZCTA China Trade Awards. =Michael Stedman= Michael Stedman is credited with saving the company, which was close to being shut down when he became Managing Director in 1991 after having been Head of Training at the Australian Film and Television School, Head of Features for ABC in Australia, Consultant to the United Nations and Director of Production for TVNZ. Michael was created an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to television, and awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Otago. In 2009 he was named the Screen Producers and Development Association's (SPADA) Industry Champion of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award.

Nannita Regina H. Daisey was born in Pennsylvania in 1855. After the deaths of her parents she lived and was educated at the Sisters of the Good Shepherd Convent in St. Louis, Missouri. Moving east to work as a teacher, she lived in Kentucky where she also began a career in journalism, fighting the gender discrimination common at that time against women who sought professional careers. Moving to Oklahoma, she participated in four land runs, where predominantly white settlers were allowed by the US government to claim lands that had previously been allotted in perpetuity to Native Americans. In addition to teaching and journalism, Daisey was active in the Guthrie, Oklahoma community where she made her home, helping other women to claim homesteads, and helping initiate schools in the new towns. By 1890 she had married Scandinavian immigrant and US Army soldier Andreas E. J. Ueland Svegeborg; the couple had no children. Daisey died in 1903. Daisey is, and was, most known for exaggerated accounts of her activities. Dramatically, in the first (1889) land run, she jumped from the front of one of the first trains into the Territory, staked her land claim, and reboarded the train before it passed her by. That feat gained her local notoriety, and the tale was reported in local, regional, and national newspapers. After her death, an obituary reported that she had leapt from the train's cowcatcher, a claim not supported by any contemporary accounts of her actions, nor by her own accounts in published interviews. Nevertheless, that version of the tale has been passed on in printed histories of Oklahoma, the Land Run of 1889, and the town of Edmond (where Daisey's homestead site lies). On Independence Day (July 4) 2007 the town of Edmond unveiled a statue of Daisey, leaping from the cowcatcher at the front of a train. The statue is named \\"Leaping into History\\" and was sculpted by local artist Mary Lou Gresham. Estimated cost for the project was $160,000 by funded by the Edmond Parks Foundation, Inc. as well as private donations. Thus, Daisey, along with even more famous westerners such as Calamity Jane, has become most known for a mythologized version of her life and its events. These larger than life exploits were depicted in an episode of the Comedy Central show Drunk History, where she was played by Kat Dennings.

It formed the basis of the Showtime television series Dexter and won the 2005 Dilys Award and the 2007 Book to TV award. Plot The novel's protagonist, Dexter Morgan, works for the Miami-Dade Police Department as a forensic blood spatter analyst. In his spare time, Dexter is a serial killer who kills murderers, rapists, child molesters & other undesirables that he believes the legal system has failed to stop. Dexter's murders are directed by an inner voice that he refers to as \\"The Dark Passenger\\", which keeps prodding Dexter to satisfy his homicidal urges on a regular basis. Once he has done so, the voice is placated for a while, but it always eventually comes back. Flashbacks reveal that his foster father, an esteemed police detective named Harry Morgan, recognized early on that Dexter was a violent sociopath with an innate need to kill, & taught him how to kill people who had gotten away with horrific crimes as a way to channel his homicidal urges in a \\"positive\\" direction. Harry also taught the boy to be a careful & meticulous killer, to leave no clues, & to be absolutely sure that his victims were guilty before killing them. Dexter calls these rules \\"The Code of Harry.\\" Dexter succeeds in managing his double life until he investigates the \\"Tamiami Slasher,\\" who has murdered 3 prostitutes. Dexter's adoptive sister, Debra, who's also on the force & wants to be promoted to Homicide -- & knowing that her brother has eerie \\"hunches\\" -- asks him for help in solving the case. Dexter eventually decides to help Deborah due to his moral code, but still feels a compelling pull to the killer, due to similar desires. After a lucid dream, Dexter drives around Miami & spots a refrigerated truck. When he follows the truck, the killer throws a severed head in his car. The killer begins sending messages to Dexter, who finds the crimes fascinating. Dexter is torn between helping Debra & allowing the killer to continue his spree. Meanwhile, due to his strange dreams, Dexter wants to kill somebody, so he follows a man whom he suspects of raping & killing 5 teenage girls & kills that man after confirming his guilt. The killer kidnaps Debra & brings Dexter to the scene, revealing that his sister is being held in the same shipping container that Dexter's mother Laura was held in. The killer is Dexter's biological brother, Brian, who was separated from Dexter after their mother's murder at the hands of a drug dealer. As Debra's spiteful colleague, Migdia LaGuerta, arrives on the scene, Brian is disappointed that Dexter refuses to kill Debra. Dexter allows Brian to kill LaGuerta & helps him escape, out of a sense of familial loyalty. In the epilogue, Dexter stands at LaGuerta's funeral & feels sad, but cannot bring himself to cry. Award Darkly Dreaming Dexter won the 2005 Dilys Award presented by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Television series adaptation The novel is the basis for a TV series on the cable network Showtime. Whereas the first season largely followed the plot of the original book, subsequent seasons featured original storylines not directly based on subsequent \\"Dexter\\" novels. Darkly Dreaming Dexter was also featured on an episode of Booked, a Canadian television series that investigates crime fiction novels through the eyes of real forensic science experts.\\"Booked.TV\\". In popular culture In Episode 2 of the fifth season of the TV series Billions, Charles ‚ÄúChuck‚Äù Rhoades, is in a session with a therapist. When prompted by the therapist to choose a 'wise person', Rhoades, an avid reader of crime fiction, nominates Dexter's father, Harry Morgan, for guidance.

Cyriacus was born in Nordhausen. As a student, he was a fellow tenant of Martin Luther in Wittenberg, later became a minister in Eisleben, and in 1559 the General Dean of the Grafschaft Mansfeld. In January 1575, he lost his place at Mansfeld because in the Flacian controversy he sided with Matthias Flacius. Along with Flacius, he taught that through original sin some of the substantial faculties of men were also corrupted. This contradicted the doctrine of his opponents that only accidental faculties were depraved. He served as a pastor at Schlitz, Hesse from 1580 until getting expelled in 1590. After getting expelled, he went on a short retreat to Vacha before moving to Strassburg, where his youngest son, , a celebrated poet, lived, and where he died. Among the last pupils of Luther, Spangenberg is the most prominent. He wrote about 150 works. As a historian he wrote Mansfeldi Chronica, Saxonian Chronica, and other publications. His Adelsspiegel is probably the most important early-modern aristocracy treatise. Also he wrote How Husbands Ought to Behave and What every Christian should make...Confession of Faith.

Biography  Menahem's father Aaron, forced to leave France in 1306 through the expulsion of the Jews, went to Spain and settled in Estella, where Menahem passed his youth. In the massacre which took place in Estella on the 5th and 6th of March 1328, Menahem's parents and his four younger brothers were slain. Menahem himself was stricken to the ground, and lay all but dead from his wounds, when he was saved through the compassion of a knight, a friend of his father's. He then studied two years under Joshua ibn Shuaib, after which he went to Alcal√° to join Joseph ibn al-'Aish, with whom he studied the Talmud and Tosafot. His chief teacher was Judah ben Asher, who went through the whole of the Talmud with him, with the exception of the third and fourth orders. In 1361 Menahem succeeded Joseph ibn al'Aish as rabbi in Alcala, and held office for eight years, during which time he also taught the Talmud. In consequence of the civil war which broke out in 1368, Menahem lost all his property, and he then went to Toledo, where Don Samuel Abravanel took him under his protection, and enabled him to continue his studies during the rest of his life. Menahem died at Toledo in July 1385.  Zedah la-Derek  In honor and for the benefit of Abravanel, Menahem wrote Zedah la-Derek (Ferrara, 1554). This work occupies a peculiar position among law codes, and is in a certain sense unique. As the author states in the introduction (ed. Sabbionetta, p. 166), it is intended mainly for rich Jews who associate with princes and who, on account of their high station and their intercourse with the non-Jewish world, are not over-rigorous in regard to Jewish regulations. For such a class of readers a law-codex must not be too voluminous, but must contain the most essential laws, especially those that the higher classes would be inclined to overstep. The ·∫íedah la-Derek is divided into five parts (comprising altogether 372 sections), which may be summarized as follows: *Part i.: The ritual and all that is related to it, as, for example, the regulations concerning phylacteries, zizit, etc. * Part ii.: Laws concerning forbidden foods. * Part iii.: Marriage laws. * Part iv.: Sabbath and feast- days. * Part v.: Fast-days and laws for mourning. As a supplement to the last part is a treatise on the Messiah and on the resurrection of the dead. Menahem sought to emphasize the ethical side of the Law in his work. He was not satisfied with merely stating the regulations like other religious codifiers: he tried also to give a reason for them. Deficient as the ·∫íedah la-Derek is as a code, its author has succeeded remarkably well in bringing to light the religious element in the Jewish ceremonial. At the same time he is far removed from mysticism (comp. ib. ed. Sabbionetta, iv. 4, 1, p. 187), possessing an unusually wide mental horizon. Although his parents and brothers fell victim to religious hatred, he still maintained that the superiority of Israel as the \\"chosen people\\" is based upon their fulfilling God's word, and \\"that a non-Jew who lives in accordance with God's will is more worthy than a Jew who does not perform it\\" (ib. i. 1, 33, p. 39). In dogmatical questions Menahem was more inclined to a strictly Orthodox point of view than to a philosophical one, although he believed that the Biblical stories of the Creation and the Bible's teaching about the resurrection contained mysteries, which he did not venture to solve. In a Turin manuscript (A. iv. 37) are given laws by him on shehitah and bedikah, perhaps excerpted from his larger work.

The prizes are named in honor of Henry Pierre Heineken, son of founder Gerard Adriaan Heineken, Alfred Heineken, former chairman of Heineken Holdings, and Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, current chair of the Heineken Prizes Foundations, which fund all Heineken Prizes for Arts and Sciences. Thirteen winners of the Dr H. P. Heineken Prize for Biochemistry and Biophysics or the Dr A. H. Heineken Prize for Medicine have gone on to win a Nobel Prize. Organization The five science prizes ($200,000 each) are: 1\\\\. Dr H. P. Heineken Prize for Biochemistry and Biophysics 2‚Äì4. Dr A. H. Heineken Prizes for History, Medicine and Environmental Sciences 5\\\\. C. L. de Carvalho-Heineken Prize for Cognitive Sciences In 1988, the Dr A. H. Heineken Prize for Art was established to be awarded to an outstanding artist working in the Netherlands. The prize is ‚Ç¨100,000, half of which is to be spent on a publication and/or exhibit. Since 2010, Heineken Young Scientists Awards are given to young talent in similar research fields as the Dr H. P. Heineken, Dr A. H. Heineken and C. L. de Carvalho-Heineken Prizes. Selection The selection system of the Heineken Prizes can be compared to that of the Nobel Prizes. Scientists from all over the world are invited to nominate fellow scientists for the Heineken Prizes. The Royal Netherlands Academy appoints special committees consisting of eminent scientists and chaired by a member of the board of one of the academy‚Äôs two divisions. Both members and nonmembers of the academy are eligible for membership of these committees. An independent jury of members of the academy, acting in a personal capacity, chooses the winners of the Dr A. H. Heineken Prize for Art. The Heineken Prizes are awarded in a special session of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, which takes place every even year at the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam. In 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 the Prizes were presented by the Prince of Orange.  List of laureates =Dr H. P.

Maher was born in Hillingdon in West London, and is of Irish extraction. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper who played first-class cricket for Derbyshire from 1981 and 1995. Maher played Under 16 and 18 age-group cricket for Middlesex County Cricket Club. His senior cricketing debut came in 1977, when he played for the first time for Middlesex's Second XI. against Yorkshire at Hornsey. and a further game versus the Combined Services, before pursuing his academic studies. He began reading Economics and Accountancy at Loughborough University in 1978 graduating with a BSc in 1981. Captaining Loughborough University, against Derbyshire in 1981, Maher's talent was spotted by Philip Russell, the then Derbyshire coach, and was asked to play a series of 2nd team games. Maher's debut was against Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 1981, taking 5 catches and a stumping on debut, and Derbyshire signed him on a two-year contract. His batting skills matured at the County Ground, and Derbyshire's new pace attack, headed West Indies paceman Michael Holding and Devon Malcolm, Maher was promoted to the role of opening batsman. Maher was described in 'The Cricketer Magazine', as a very courageous batsman, used a foil against opposition bowling attacks, on Derbyshire's green, bowler friendly wickets'. Against the New Zealand's tourists in 1986, Maher scored 126, and there were other hundreds against Leicestershire County Cricket Club, Surrey County Cricket Club, and Cambridge University. After a number of years in the role of Wicketkeeper Opening /Batsman in 1990 Maher was replaced as a regular by Karl Krikken. Maher took on the role of Derbyshire second team coach in 1990, but he was on call for the first team, and played a large part of the 1993 season for the first team due to injuries, his final game being against Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1993. Maher stayed as player-coach until 1995 when a lower back injury forced his retirement. Gerald Mortimer a ' Derbyshire Evening Telegraph' journalist, in an article in 1995, described Maher, 'as a man who you would want on your side, as he would never let you down'. After his retirement from cricket, Maher continued commentating for BBC Radio and, after his cricketing days came to a close, worked as a Financial Consultant, and a Fly-Fishing instructor. Maher is a current England fly- fishing international, and was national English fly-fishing champion in 2005/6. He also has 5 Commonwealth team medals, in championships in Devon, England 2014, Tasmania 2012, Rhayader Wales 2010, Islay Scotland 2009, and New Zealand 2008. He is the owner of 'Press Manor Fishing Lakes' in Ashover, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire, where he operates a day-ticket fishing business. He holds coaching and instructor qualifications for the Association of Advanced Professional Game Angling Instructors (AAPGAI), the American Federation of Fly Fishers (FFF) and Advanced Professional Game Angling Qualifications (APGAI) in Trout and Salmon.

It was originally hosted by Michel Robbe, with other hosts being Christophe Dechavanne and Victoria Silvstedt and then by Benjamin Castaldi and 2008's Miss France, Val√©rie B√®gue in early 2012. Silvstedt was also a co-host for the Italian version called La Ruota Della Fortuna (The Wheel of Fortune) that aired on Italia 1 From 2007 until 2009. The show aired on French television network TF1. The first episode aired on 5 January 1987, running until 1997. The modern incarnation of the show began in 2006, and ended in March 2012. History When the show was originally produced in France, an attempt was made to copy the American version of the show exactly, even to the point where host Michel Robbe copied the mannerisms of the American host. Producer Marc Gurnaud said that in order to retain its American aspects, the show had to move along quickly with no pauses or attempts at conversation between the hosts. By May 1987, the show had a viewership of approximately 10 million. Hosts * Michel Robbe (1987) * Christian Morin (September 1987-December 1992) * Alexandre Debanne (January 1993-December 1994) * Olivier Chiabodo (January 1995-April 1997) * Christophe Dechavanne (7 August 2006 - 1 January 2012) * Benjamin Castaldi (2 January 2012 - 23 March 2012) Hostesses * Annie Pujol (1987 - December 1994) * Sandra Rossi (January 1995) * Frederique Calvez (February 1995 - April 1997) * Victoria Silvstedt (7 August 2006 ‚Äì 1 January 2012) * Val√©rie B√®gue (2 January 2012 - 23 March 2012) Gameplay The wheel had 24 spaces. These represented cash values, penalty spaces, and strategic elements for use in the game. A player who did not land on a penalty space asked for a consonant. If it was not in the puzzle, play proceeded to the next player. If the letter appeared in the puzzle, the hostess revealed all instances of it, and the player was credited with cash. All descriptions of players being credited in the remainder of this article assume that the player called a consonant which appeared in the puzzle. From 1987 to 1997, the wheel's colour scheme was similar to the US version's round 1 wheel used from 1986-1996. Game notes =The Wheel= When the franc was in use, the minimum cash value on the wheel was 500‚Ç£ and the top values went as high as 10,000‚Ç£. Since adopting the euro, values ranged from ‚Ç¨0 - ‚Ç¨500 with top values of ‚Ç¨1,000, ‚Ç¨1,500, and ‚Ç¨2,000. Since 2012, the values are ranged from ‚Ç¨0 - ‚Ç¨300. The ‚Ç¨0 space meant a contestant had to guess a letter correctly to continue but won nothing. =French Terms for Special Wheel Wedges= *Relance/Joker: Free Spin (used only in the original versions). *Passe: Lose a Turn. *Banqueroute: Bankrupt. Note that the Bankrupt/$10,000/Bankrupt wedge was only used in the 2006 version in Round 4. In January 2012, this was replaced by a ‚Ç¨60,000 wedge which worked the same way as the Million Dollar Wedge in the current US version. *Jackpot: The Jackpot was administered differently from the US version. The value was ‚Ç¨0 at the beginning of the game and increased with every spin of the wheel but did not become available until round three. Starting with the third round, the Jackpot wedge was added and administered like a regular prize wedge in that a player must land on the wedge and call a letter in the puzzle to acquire the special wedge. The player must not hit Bankrupt for the remainder of the round and solve the puzzle to win the Jackpot. *Mystfre: Mystery. Used in Round 2 from October 26 to December 18, 2009 and in Round 1 in the 2012 version, these wedges offered ‚Ç¨300 (‚Ç¨50 in 2012) per letter or a chance to flip it. It could be ‚Ç¨2,500 (‚Ç¨500 in 2012) or Bankrupt. Having first appeared on the French version on 31 August 2009, the Jackpot wedge was similar to the US Jackpot wedge used in Season 26. The wedge had a 3D design which made it stand out above the rest of the wheel. =Unique to European Versions (not used in the US version)= Two different wedges Hold up: Used in Round 4, anyone who landed on this wedge and correctly guessed a letter could steal the earnings of the leading opponent in that round, just like the \\"Power\\" wedge from the Philippine ABS-CBN version of Wheel of Fortune. In the Dutch version, this is called \\"Overhaul.\\" Caverne: Used in Round 2, a player who landed on this wedge would have the opportunity to win small prizes, such as electronics, bicycles, etc. They had 15 seconds to select as many prizes from the Cave as possible. However, if the total value of the chosen prizes exceeded a set limit they lost all the prizes. In the original version, the limit was 15,000‚Ç£. It then became ‚Ç¨2,500 in round two and ‚Ç¨2,000 in round three. After the premiere of the Jackpot round on 31 August 2009, the value of the Caverne space was worth ‚Ç¨2,000 in both rounds two and three. In the 2012 version, the time limit was 30 seconds with a ‚Ç¨1,500 limit. The Caverne space was similar to a blend of the classic shopping for prizes segment combined with the physical game action of the US children's version Wheel 2000. Zero Euro Wedge: A player who landed on this wedge needed to correctly guess a letter on the board to remain in control of the wheel but collected nothing. Note the US version of Wheel of Fortune had a $0 wedge, but this existed only during the first pilot in 1973 (named \\"Shopper's Bazaar\\"). Flash Cash: This existed in Round 3 only in the 2012 version. If a player landed on this, he or she had 10 seconds to solve the puzzle for a bonus up to ‚Ç¨1,000, decreasing by ‚Ç¨100 for each second spent trying to guess the puzzle. It is likely unknown whether or not the turn was lost if the 10 seconds ran out. =Buying a vowel= Vowels cost 2,000‚Ç£ (1,000‚Ç£ by 1994), but were later worth ‚Ç¨200 beginning in 2006 and ‚Ç¨100 in 2012. Like the US version, if a player had enough money to buy a vowel, they could do so at a flat rate, and not at a multiplied rate like consonants. Unlike the US version, the fee is not levied if the called vowel is not in the puzzle. =Shopping= The original French version used the pre-1987 US version element of shopping, which worked exactly the same way. However, the more recent incarnations offered for cash (as has been the case since 1987 in the US version). =Toss- Up Puzzles= A major difference with the US version was the toss-up puzzle. In this version, every round started with such a puzzle (in the US version, they are played before contestant interviews, and before the first and fourth rounds). However, like the US version, there was a toss-up before the contestant interviews to determine who would be introduced first. Furthermore, they were worth ‚Ç¨500 and the right to start the round with the ‚Ç¨500 that could be lost if a player spins Bankrupt. The regular puzzle must be solved to keep the money. (The 2007-09 Italian version of the show would repeat this concept.) =Bonus Round= The more recent versions used the US version's 2001 rules with a 24-space Bonus Wheel, with the top winner of the day spinning it. In 2006, the prizes could be cash amounts from ‚Ç¨5,000, ‚Ç¨7,500, ‚Ç¨10,000, ‚Ç¨15,000, ‚Ç¨20,000, and ‚Ç¨25,000, two cars, or the top prize of ‚Ç¨100,000. In the daily version from 2012, the envelopes contained one car, ‚Ç¨2,000, ‚Ç¨2,500, ‚Ç¨3,000, ‚Ç¨4,000, ‚Ç¨5,000, ‚Ç¨10,000, and the top prize was ‚Ç¨30,000 unless the ‚Ç¨60,000 wedge was brought into the bonus round. The contestant was then shown a puzzle and then all of the instances of R, S, T, L, N and E which appeared in that puzzle. The contestant then chose three more consonants and an additional vowel. After all the letters were chosen, they were revealed if they appear in the puzzle. The player then had 10 seconds to solve the puzzle. As is the case in the US version, the player's prize they were playing for was not revealed until after the round ends. In the original run, the player chose five consonants and a vowel. From 1994 until 1997, the winning player touched one of 24 panels at his or her podium, each of which concealed two different consonants which would light up when touched, and the player called three more consonants and then a vowel. Studio The 2006 French studio was somewhat identical to the US version, with the French puzzle board exactly like the US one. The only major difference was that the studio audience was directly behind the contestants, unlike the US version, where the video wall stands behind the contestants. There was also a light display around the puzzle board that alternates between red, yellow, and blue, to indicate what player's turn it was. The board used from 1995 to 1997 also had this feature. Other countries that had their sets similar, although not exactly the same, to the French version include Italy (La Ruota Della Fortuna) until 2009, Turkey (√áarkƒ±felek) until about 2010, Poland (Ko≈Ço Fortuny) until 2009, and Portugal (A Roda da Sorte) until 2009. Of these four specific versions, only Turkey's version is still on the air. (Poland would eventually get a new version in 2017; like the 2009 set, this one has the audience directly behind the contestants.) Categories The French version of Wheel of Fortune had categories that are slightly variated from the U.S. version. * CHOSE, MACHIN, TRUC - THING. The name of the category comes from the different ways to say \\"thing\\" in French. ** EN VOITURE - THING related to an automobile. ** BRICOLAGE ET JARDINAGE - THING related with DIY and gardening. * EXPRESSION FAMILI√àRE - Roughly equivalent to PHRASE. * PERSONNAGE - FICTIONAL CHARACTER. * ENIGME √Ä DOUBLE SENS - A hybrid category of FILL IN THE BLANK and BEFORE & AFTER. The puzzle consists of two words or expressions linked together by a common word, of which the solving player can win ‚Ç¨500 for correctly identifying. * 7ME ART - SHOW BIZ. The category comes from the French expression for film and cinema. * LOISIRS & JEUX - FUN & GAMES. A related \\"subcategory\\" also exists. ** SPORT - FUN & GAMES related to sports. * VIE QUOTIDIENNE - Deals with activities in one's daily life. Roughly similar to WHAT ARE YOU DOING? or EVENT. ** EN HIVER - Like EVENT, but deals with activities exclusively done in the winter. Usually it is only used during the winter episodes. * LIEU OU MONUMENT - PLACE or LANDMARK in the U.S. version. ** SUR LA PLAN√àTE - ON THE MAP, however it is often interchanged with LIEU OU MONUMENT. * ARTS References Roue de la Fortune Roue de la Fortune Category:Roulette and wheel games Category:1987 French television series debuts Category:1997 French television series endings Category:2006 French television series debuts Category:2012 French television series endings Category:1980s French television series Category:French television series based on American television series ","title":"La Roue de la fortune"},{"id":"7688617","text":"Panteleimon Kondratyevich Ponomarenko (, ; 18 January 1984) was one of the leaders of Soviet partisan resistance in Belarus.

He fought in the Russian civil war and became a member of the Communist party in 1925.  Career  =As the head of Belarus= From 1938 to 1947, Ponomarenko was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Belorussia, and from 1944 to 1948, also the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Belarus. During the Great Purge he successfully defended Belarusian-language poets Yanka Kupala and Yakub Kolas from repressions, personally travelling to Stalin to appeal for their protection. The two poets were later awarded the Order of Lenin. During this time he also assisted the National Jazz Orchestra in Minsk, inviting Eddie Rosner to lead it.Ponomarenko during World War II =During World War II= During World War II, he was one of the leaders of the Communist partisan units within Nazi-occupied Belarus. He was granted the rank of Lieutenant general in March 1943. According to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, during that time he also clashed with the Polish underground and gave orders for his troops to disarm them and execute their officers. In this aspect, the institute claims, the forces under Ponomarenko's command initiated a limited collaboration with the Nazi occupation forces informing on members of the Polish underground. =After the war= From 16 October 1952 until 6 March 1953, Ponomarenko was a member of the Politburo (called Presidium at the time) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was made First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR in 1954 before becoming the Soviet ambassador to Poland between 1955 and 1957.Brown, Archie (1990) \\"Ponomarenko, Pantaleimon Kondrat'evich (1902‚Äì1984)\\" The Soviet Union: A biographical dictionary Macmillan Publishing Co., New York, ;Vronskaya, Jeanne and Chuguev, Vladimir (1988) \\"Ponomarenko, Panteleimon Kondrat'evich (1902‚Äì1984)\\" A Biographical Dictionary of the Soviet Union, 1917‚Äì1988 K.G. Saur, London, ; From 26 October 1957 to 22 April 1959 Ponomarenko was the Soviet ambassador to India and Nepal, and from 30 June 1959 to 21 June 1962 to the Netherlands. In his later years, Ponomarenko was a professor at the between 1964 and 1974.  In popular culture  In the video game Hearts of Iron IV by Paradox Interactive, Panteleimon Ponomarenko became a meme due to his name being the generic name of a communist leader in one of the numerous mods for the game. The generic leader portrait is wrongly believed to be based on him, even though it in fact depicts John Adams, 1st Baron Adams.

A geodesic grid is a spatial grid based on a geodesic polyhedron or Goldberg polyhedron. Construction Volume rendering of Geodesic grid applied in atmosphere simulation using Global Cloud Resolving Model (GCRM). The combination of grid illustration and volume rendering of vorticity (yellow tubes) . Note that for the purpose of clear illustration in the image, the grid is coarser than the actual one used to generate the vorticity.The icosahedron A highly divided geodesic polyhedron based on the icosahedron A highly divided Goldberg polyhedron: the dual of the above image. A geodesic grid is a global Earth reference that uses triangular tiles based on the subdivision of a polyhedron (usually the icosahedron, and usually a Class I subdivision) to subdivide the surface of the Earth. Such a grid does not have a straightforward relationship to latitude and longitude, but conforms to many of the main criteria for a statistically valid discrete global grid. Primarily, the cells' area and shape are generally similar, especially near the poles where many other spatial grids have singularities or heavy distortion. The popular Quaternary Triangular Mesh (QTM) falls into this category. Geodesic grids may use the dual polyhedron of the geodesic polyhedron, which is the Goldberg polyhedron. Goldberg polyhedra are made up of hexagons and (if based on the icosahedron) 12 pentagons. One implementation that uses an icosahedron as the base polyhedron, hexagonal cells, and the Snyder equal-area projection is known as the Icosahedron Snyder Equal Area (ISEA) grid. Applications In biodiversity science, geodesic grids are a global extension of local discrete grids that are staked out in field studies to ensure appropriate statistical sampling and larger multi-use grids deployed at regional and national levels to develop an aggregated understanding of biodiversity. These grids translate environmental and ecological monitoring data from multiple spatial and temporal scales into assessments of current ecological condition and forecasts of risks to our natural resources. A geodesic grid allows local to global assimilation of ecologically significant information at its own level of granularity. When modeling the weather, ocean circulation, or the climate, partial differential equations are used to describe the evolution of these systems over time. Because computer programs are used to build and work with these complex models, approximations need to be formulated into easily computable forms. Some of these numerical analysis techniques (such as finite differences) require the area of interest to be subdivided into a grid ‚Äî in this case, over the shape of the Earth. Geodesic grids can be used in video game development to model fictional worlds instead of the Earth. They are a natural analog of the hex map to a spherical surface. Pros and cons Pros: *Largely isotropic. *Resolution can be easily increased by binary division. *Does not suffer from over sampling near the poles like more traditional rectangular longitude‚Äìlatitude square grids. *Does not result in dense linear systems like spectral methods do (see also Gaussian grid). *No single points of contact between neighboring grid cells. Square grids and isometric grids suffer from the ambiguous problem of how to handle neighbors that only touch at a single point. *Cells can be both minimally distorted and near-equal-area. In contrast, square grids are not equal area, while equal-area rectangular grids vary in shape from equator to poles. Cons: *More complicated to implement than rectangular longitude‚Äìlatitude grids in computers History The earliest use of the (icosahedral) geodesic grid in geophysical modeling dates back to 1968 and the work by Sadourny, Arakawa, and Mintz and Williamson.Williamson, 1969 Later work expanded on this base.Cullen and Hall, 1979.Randall et al., 2000; Randall et al., 2002.

It is one of the hard fruit crop found in India all over the plains of southern Maharastra, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The fruit is not under regular orcharding, however along the border of fields, roads, railways lines and as a roadside tree, near villages and banks of river are the most common places where the plants are found as stray plant. Plant seed are important unconventional sources of proteins which when incorporated in food products would improve the functional properties such as absorption of water or oil and also in the formation of stable foam. They are also good nutritional supplements. The fruit is amazingly hard rind which can be difficult to crack, security rind about 6mm thick, greyish-white, pulp is brown, odorous, mealy, resinous, astringent, acid or sweetish with numerous small, white seeds scattered through it. There are two forms, one with large sweet fruits and the other with small, acid fruits. Propagation is done by seed used and vegetative method. But high rate of seeding mortality and out breeding nature of this plant account for the poor regeneration and inferior germplasm. To overcome this, in vitro propagation through axillary bud proliferation has been developed. It is a climacteric fruit, ripening may also take place after fruit is harvested. It is well known for its quality and storage life, which helps avoiding the waste of raw material.

India's second oldest publicly quoted company, BBTC was established to engage in the Burmese tea business through the initial step of taking over the Burmese assets of William Wallace. The company‚Äôs founding occurred when the six Wallace Brothers, originally members of a Scottish merchant house in Edinburgh, first arrived in Bombay (now Mumbai) in the 1840s. A Bombay partnership was formed in 1848 as ‚ÄúWallace Bros & Co‚Äù. In the mid-1850s the Wallaces set up a business in Rangoon, shipping tea to Bombay. In 1863 the business was floated as ‚ÄúThe Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation‚Äù. Its equity was held by both Indian merchants along with the Wallace Brothers, who had the controlling interests. By the 1870s the company was a leading producer of teak in Burma and Siam, as well as having interests in cotton, oil exploration and shipping. British motivations for the third Anglo-Burmese War were partly influenced by concerns of the BBTC. The Burmese state's conflict with the BBTC furnished British leaders with a pretext for conquest. By the 1880s Wallace Brothers had become a leading financial house in London. This firm was able to affect the intelligence about Burma and, more critically, about the growing French influence in the country. The Vissanji family purchased the company from the Wallace brothers around the time of Indian independence. In 1992, the BBTC acquired and merged in BCL Springs. Later, BBTC was acquired by the Wadia group based in Bombay.

Plot summary Archer is hired by escaped mental patient Carl Hallman to investigate the deaths of his wealthy and influential parents. His mother died in a drowning several years earlier, and his father, a Senator, died more recently. Carl claims to have been sent to a mental hospital by his older brother to prevent him from exposing the family's dark secrets, and escaped to contact Archer. Carl's brother dies in a shooting that is blamed on Carl, and a manhunt for Carl ensues across the family's vast orange orchards and surrounding property. The more Archer investigates, the more suspects he finds for the trio of deaths that haunt the Hallman family. The title is taken from the poem To an Unborn Pauper Child, by Thomas Hardy: :Breathe not, hid Heart: cease silently, / And though thy birth- hour beckons thee, / Sleep the long sleep: The Doomsters heap / Travails and teens around us here / And Time-Wraiths turn our songsingings to fear. http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/to-an-unborn-pauper-child/ The poem reflects on the difficulty of escaping the lot to which we are born, an underlying theme of Macdonald's book. Reception Many sources agree that this book marked a turning point in the series, wherein Macdonald abandoned his imitations of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett and found his own voice. It also marks Lew Archer as a man more interested in understanding the criminal than in catching him.

Fr. Nicholas Salamis () (August 13, 1897 - October 15, 2005) was a Greek Orthodox priest of the Eastern Orthodox faith who witnessed almost a century of Greek emigration into Canada. Early life Salamis was born on the Greek island of Samos. When he was five, his father died, leaving the family destitute. His mother raised her two sons and one daughter on money earned by renting out a mule for conveyance to local villagers. Salamis' mother was determined to educate her sons. She enrolled both her boys in the high school on the other side of the island where Nicholas received his training in commerce. Seventeen years old and armed with his certificate, Nicholas first immigrated to America (see Greek American), then settled in the Greek community of Montr√©al in 1919. The Greek community in Montr√©al, following World War I, had a population of 2,000 Greeks, and 500 Greek-owned businesses. It was not long before Salamis was the bookkeeper for the whole community. Despite this supportive community and the prospect of continued success, Salamis felt something lacking in his life. Study At 35, Salamis returned to Athens to study theology. He had decided to become an Orthodox priest. In 1938, he became Father Nicholas Salamis and spent the first seven years of his priesthood at St. George Greek Orthodox Church parish in Toronto. In 1945 he was transferred back to Montr√©al. Return to Canada The Orthodox Church is vital to any Greek community--it serves as a link to the past and the glue that binds the various factions of a Greek community often divided by political beliefs and opinions. Salamis arrived in Montr√©al just before a great change took place in the Greek community. Towards the end of the 1940s, over 100,000 Greeks immigrated to Canada. They were largely uneducated, unskilled, with little or no knowledge of either official language of Canada. They fled to Canada to escape the horrors that had plagued Greece for the better part of the century: war, oppression, and economic collapse. Salamis not only administered to their spiritual needs with baptisms, weddings, and funerals, he also eased the frictions which developed between the established Greek community and the new immigrants, who were referred to as \\"displaced persons\\" (see Greek Diaspora). Pastoral work By his own count, Salamis performed over 10,000 religious ceremonies during his service to the Greek Orthodox community of Canada. Salamis became the rock of the community over the next forty years, watching over his flock from the time they arrived as desperate new immigrants, scared and clinging to the safety of their community. He shepherded the children of these immigrants as they became members of the greater Canadian society, learning the official languages, getting the education that their parents so desperately wished for them. Salamis died at the age of 108 on October 15, 2005.

The plot features Bugs' conflict with a red-haired hound dog, whom the rabbit sets out to evade and make a fool of using one-liners, reverse psychology, disguises and other tricks. It was released in theaters by Warner Bros. on June 24, 1944. The title is a pun on \\"hair ribbon\\". It is also the first Warner Bros. cartoon to include Bugs' head in the opening title sequence.  Plot  The short opens with a dog with a Russian accent (a la Bert Gordon's \\"Mad Russian\\") hunting for a rabbit by sniffing a trail. He happens upon Bugs who begins to torment the dog. This prompts a chase, which leads to a nearby lake where the rest of the story continues. The rest of the action takes place underwater. Eventually, after a few gags, with Bugs dressed up as a mermaid, playing tag with the dog and throwing the dog into a rock, leaving his feet sticking out and Bugs disguising himself as Elmer Fudd, the dog corners Bugs and demands he gives him a rabbit sandwich. Bugs obliges, and the rabbit places himself between two giant slices of loaf bread with his legs curled next to his body. The dog takes a bite and Bugs screams and fakes his death. The dog becomes instantly grief-stricken and sobs, declaring that he should be the one to die. With this statement, Bugs springs back to life asking, \\"Ehhhh...do you mean it?\\", and obliges the dog's death wish (see Censorship and alternative endings below). The dog falls to the ground, Bugs plants a flower on his chest and dances away into the distance. As the cartoon is about to \\"iris out\\" the dog sits up (revealing that he is still alive), holds the iris before it closes, and declares \\"This shouldn't even happen to a dog!\\".Cohen (2004), p. 36-37 He then lets the iris go, but it closes on his nose in the process, making him yelp in pain. Cast * Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Russian Dog speaking like Elmer Fudd * Sam Wolfe as Russian Dog (uncredited)  Analysis  Michael S. Shull and David E. Wilt consider it ambiguous if this cartoon contain a World War II-related reference. While underwater, Bugs disguises himself as a mermaid. The dog transforms into a torpedo to pursue \\"her\\".Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 216 The two alternate versions of the ending were based on the perception of someone that Bugs could not be seen killing another animal. This someone was perhaps a studio administrator.Cohen (2004), p. 36-37 The opening gag of this cartoon in which the dog sniffs around Bugs' armpits and then exclaims \\"B.O!\\" (body odor) in a voice similar to that of a foghorn is a parody of a then popular radio ad for Life Buoy Soap. Curiously, part of the speech from one of the Japanese soldiers from the episode Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips is also heard in the background, when Bugs faked being a waiter asking for a rabbit sandwich. Several scenes from the cartoon are reanimated scenes from Tex Avery's The Heckling Hare. Scenes include opening shot of the dog sniffing for a rabbit and the scene of Bugs and the dog jumping into the lake. An additional scene of Bugs hopping cycle from Tortoise Beats Hare, and an animation from A Corny Concerto was reused as well.  Censorship and alternative endings  The two alternate endings to Hare Ribbin'. Each depicts the dog's death via gun violence, which is today considered too harsh for family audience. This cartoon short holds the distinction of having two endings, both of which are too violent by today's standards to be shown on children/family-friendly television. In both endings, the Russian Dog, distraught over Bugs' \\"death\\" and guilt-ridden, wishes he were dead too. Bugs then quotes the Mad Russian, saying, \\"eh, do you mean it?\\" After that scene comes one of two different scenarios: The original theatrical ending: Bugs gives the dog a gun so he can commit suicide by shooting himself in the headCohen (2004), p. 36-37‚Äîonce played in theaters to a general audience, is now commonly cut from television versions on network and cable TV, although it has aired uncensored (as recently as 2015) on the Canadian cable channel Teletoon Retro. It has also aired on May 1, 2020 on Australian Foxtel cable channel, Boomerang. This ending was also aired uncensored on an episode of Cartoon Network's The Bob Clampett Show, as well as the Cartoon Network's New Year's Day Looney Tunes marathons in 2009 and 2010. The edit occurs between the scene where Bugs says \\"Do you mean it?\\" and the dog laying down, making it seem as if the dog had dropped dead out of guilt without shooting himself. The \\"director's cut\\" ending: Bugs pulls out a gun, shooting the dog through the mouth. Bugs then dances away, and the dog gets up to deliver the last line: \\"This shouldn't happen to a dog.\\"Cohen (2004), p. 36-37 was never shown in theaters or on television, despite that the episode of Cartoon Network's The Bob Clampett Show that aired \\"Hare Ribbin'\\" with its general release ending mentioned that \\"Hare Ribbin'\\" had an alternate ending (this one) that was never shown, and due to its violence, never will be. The director's cut version was first discovered on the fifth volume of the laserdisc set of \\"The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 5\\" and the entire cartoon with the director's cut part is now on the fifth volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD set as a special feature. Other scenes included in the director's cut is an extended scene of the Dog sniffing for Bugs in the beginning of the film. Also when the dog turns around and sees Bugs in his mermaid costume, in the original cut the Dog turns into a torpedo right when Bugs whistles at him. The director's cut adds a scene where the dog starts heavy breathing before turning into a torpedo, with an extended version of them playing tag. One scene that is not used in the director's cut is when we see Bugs move his body up in the bread so he's not actually eaten by the dog. Based on the slight difference in animation style from the rest of the film, both this and the scene when Bugs hands him the gun appear to be re-shoots, added before the theatrical release.

Born in Cremona, he moved to Bologna, where he was a pupil of Lorenzo Pasinelli. He is described by Wittkower as the \\"Bolognese Marco Benefial\\", in that his style was less decorative and edged into a more formal neoclassical style. It is an academicized grand style, that crystallizes into a manneristic neoclassicism, with crisp and frigid modeling of the figures. Among his followers were Aureliano Milani, Francesco Monti, and Ercole Graziani the Younger. Two other pupils were Domenico Maria Fratta and Giuseppe Peroni. Astronomical canvases One memorable conceit in Creti's output is a series of small canvases depicting celestial bodies, disproportionately sized and illuminated, above nocturnal landscapes. The paintings, commissioned in 1711 by the Bolognese count Luigi Marsili and intended as a gift to Pope Clement XI, were meant to accentuate the need for the Papal States to sponsor an astronomical observatory. With the support of Clement XI, the first public astronomical observatory in Italy was opened in Bologna a short time later. The eight small canvases display the sun, moon, a comet, and the then-known five planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. His Jupiter depicts the Great Red Spot (first reported in 1665) and at least two moons .

In order to pass from a level to the next it is necessary to kill the enemies that are present in the current level, until one of them drops a key card that will enable the access to the next level. In Summer of 2005, this game was ported to mobile phones as Duke Nukem Mobile 3D and enhanced to include a mode where the enemies are rendered as polygonal models. In spring of 2007, the game was re-released for mobile phones again, under the title Duke Nukem Arena. It added a new survival mode and up to 4-player multiplayer Deathmatch. In April 2020, a Nintendo DS development cartridge containing a port of Duke Nukem Mobile 3D called \\"Duke Nukem DS\\" was sold on eBay.

It has a columnar habit, with a lime-green cylindrical body with 1‚Äì2 cm long golden spines. Description Echinopsis spachiana grows as a cactus with a columnar habit, reaching 2 m (7 ft) high, with a diameter of . Vertical branches arise from the base of the plant. Each column has 10‚Äì15 rounded ribs. The large areoles are around 1 cm apart, and have wavy yellow hairs. The straight spines are red-yellow initially, fading to white as they age. The central spine is around long, and is surrounded by 8 to 10 smaller radial spines that are in length. The white flowers are 15 cm (6 in) across and long, part of which is an 8 cm long tube. In their native habitat, the flowers appear in June‚ÄìJuly and open at night. Taxonomy French botanist Charles Antoine Lemaire described the species as Cereus spachianus in 1839, in honour of his countryman √âdouard Spach. The type specimen was collected in Argentina, though where in the country is unclear. Alwin Berger erected the subgenus Trichocereus in 1905, incorporating this species. Vincenzo Riccobono elevated Trichocereus to genus status in 1909, and hence it was for many years known as Trichocereus spachianus. The genus encompassed a number of columnar cacti, before being subsumed into Echinopsis. However, a 2012 genetic analysis of chloroplast DNA indicates Echinopsis is made up of several divergent lineages. E. spachiana was not included in the study but is thought to be related to a Helianthocereus clade. Distribution and habitat Echinopsis spachiana is native to western Argentina.

It premiered March 7, 2007 at Omaha, Nebraska's Orpheum. It is about a contemporary Ponca family and the spiritual journey of their son, who is deeply connected to a noted chief, Standing Bear, and an 1879 trial he won in a United States court. Several well-known people in the world of opera and other musical and theatrical works have been involved in its production. Directed by Rhoda Levine, the cast included Eugene Perry, Patrick Kilcoyne, Arnold Rawls, William Ferguson, Kristopher Irmiter, Mara Bonde, Phyllis Pancella, Joe Fitzgerald, Earl Howard and several other opera veterans.  Story  Wakonda‚Äôs Dream is about a contemporary Native American family, affected by the historical events and court case of 1879 in Nebraska, in which American Indians were recognized as ‚Äúhuman beings under the law‚Äù for the first time in U.S. history. The opera is the story of parents Delores (Ponca) and Justin Labelle, and their son Jason, struggling to find their place as American Indians in contemporary society. Young Jason ‚Äúsees things, feels things, knows things,‚Äù which terrifies his mother. Jason is also constantly for being an Indian by Sonny, an older white boy, and his brother Jimmy. Proud of her Ponca heritage, Delores keeps the history of their people alive for her son. Jason feels a ghostly connection to the long-dead Chief Standing Bear, whose legacy is revealed in a choral rendering of the famous 1879 trial. As Jason grows from childhood to manhood, Standing Bear remains his spiritual guide. His father Justin dismisses his sense of Indian birthright, leading to tragedy and, ultimately, redemption.  Evolution of the opera  As Anthony Davis was researching American Indian music and history, he attended the annual Ponca pow-wow in the Niobrara region of Nebraska. Among the thousands of attendees, one evening he met a woman and her son who inspired the characters of Delores and Jason. This woman told Davis that she lived on land where Standing Bear was buried. She said her five-year-old son saw and spoke to the spirit of the Ponca chief. In collaboration with writer Yusef Komunyakaa, the two developed a libretto in which Standing Bear serves as Jason's guide as the boy grows from childhood (in act 1) to adulthood (in act 2). Mainstream society and alcoholism serve as his chief antagonists, although he is harassed by some children when young. The history of the removal of the Ponca to a reservation in Indian Territory, and the subsequent internment and trial of Standing Bear after he led his people back to their homelands, are revealed through the boy's spiritual communion and through a choral reenactment of the famous trial. Davis says, > \\"I didn‚Äôt want to create a historical narrative or an account of the trial. > That could be more easily accomplished in other media like television or > film. In opera you have to find a way into the story. In this gifted child > we found an artistic prism to look at history and not just present history. > Having a character who can envision the past enables you to realize the past > in the present. [In Wakonda‚Äôs Dream] the past has a concrete effect on > everyone in the opera.\\" The opera's stage director, Rhoda Levine, had suggested Komunyakaa as librettist. She had experience working with him on a project through Northwestern University. The composer and poet immediately agreed to collaborate at an introductory meeting held in the offices of New York City Opera in December 2002. Komunyakaa knew of Anthony Davis‚Äô work before the meeting, and was intrigued by the potential partnership. Of his writing process for this project, Komunyakaa says, \\"I knew I wanted to stay very close to poetry in writing the libretto.\\" He notes that his work \\"has always embraced aspects of history as well as the imagination.\\" He learned much about Native American history when writing a libretto based on events related to the Standing Bear trial. He did not realize that American Indians in the late 1870s were excluded from coverage under the Constitution as equal subjects of the law, that they were prohibited from owning fee simple property if members of tribes, and could not appear in a court of law. Those who belonged to tribes were not considered citizens of the United States, but members of different nations. Rhoda Levine, who also served as creative consultant during the opera development, had previously worked with Davis. She served as both director and dramaturge with Davis on his opera X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X when it premiered at New York City Opera in 1986. During the development of Wakonda‚Äôs Dream, Levine frequently referred to herself as the \\"audience advocate,\\" a term she prefers to dramaturge. Levine describes the role of history in the opera: > \\"If one denies one's past, one's future is in some way impaired because your > past informs your sense of the future. If you deny your roots, you lose a > sense of your own identity. If one feels punished not by what they do but > because of who they are ‚Äì which is how Justin [the father] feels in our > story ‚Äì there is a sense of disconnect. He wants nothing to do with his > native past. He feels it has limited his opportunities. But our past will > always enrich who we are. That is the theme of Wakonda‚Äôs Dream, and it is a > universal theme.\\"  Music  Anthony Davis describes the score for Wakonda‚Äôs Dream: > Generally, what I‚Äôm doing is a synthesis. I have created something new from > many diverse sources. My background draws on the African American tradition, > jazz particularly. I developed my own voice as an opera composer that > hopefully is not imitative or derivative. My work has a rhythmic quality to > it, with rhythmic structure as its foundation. Even in my choral writing, > the choir is like a drum.\\" He includes known songs, as well as blues, jazz and gospel-inflected music, and underlying Native American rhythms.  Vision for production  Levine describes the stage setting as \\"very simple. The action takes place on a raked surface surrounded by the chorus and a company of American Indian dancers. They are on stage throughout the entire performance, like spirits.\\" Set designer Peter Harrison says, ‚ÄúThe scenic design for Wakonda‚Äôs Dream approaches the piece on several levels to reflect the psychological and spiritual realities which co-exist musically and in the libretto. The unmoored world of Justin and his family is a floating raked earthen plain, littered with the detritus of contemporary Native American existence ‚Äì nature that has been drained of the life and fertility it once held for native people ‚Äì and filled with the trash of civilization: a broken motorcycle, old tires, crates, abandoned rusty oil drum, etc.\\" He continues, \\"The plain is also, on another level, the place where past ancestors have seen the Spirit of the earth, danced their shaman dances, and buried their dead to find a peace the modern world begrudges them.

(Jr); The African American Electorate; p. 347 Florida (1902),Farris, Charles D.; ‚ÄòThe Re-Enfranchisement of Negroes in Florida‚Äô; The Journal of Negro History; volume 39, no. 4 (October 1954), pp. 259-283 Mississippi and Alabama (also 1902), Texas (1905),Perman, Michael; Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888-1908, p. 297 Louisiana and Arkansas (1906),Gordon, Fon Louise; Caste and Class: The Black Experience in Arkansas, 1880-1920, pp. 51-52 and Georgia (1908). The white primary was one method used by white Democrats to disenfranchise most black and other minority voters. They also passed laws and constitutions with provisions to raise barriers to voter registration, completing disenfranchisement from 1890 to 1908 in all states of the former Confederacy. The Texas Legislature passed a law in 1923 that allowed political parties to make their own rules for their primaries. The dominant Democratic Party banned black and Hispanic minorities from participating. The Supreme Court, in 1927, 1932, and 1935, heard three Texas cases related to white primaries. In the 1927 and 1932 cases, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, saying that state laws establishing a white primary violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Later in 1927 Texas changed its law in response,‚ÄòNixon v. Condon. Disfranchisement of the Negro in Texas‚Äô, The Yale Law Journal, volume 41, No. 8, (June 1932), p. 1212 delegating authority to political parties to establish their own rules for primaries. In Grovey v. Townsend (1935), the Supreme Court ruled that this practice was constitutional, as it was administered by the Democratic Party, which was a private institution, not a state. In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled 8‚Äì1 against the Texas white primary system in Smith v. Allwright.Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944) In that case, the Court ruled that the 1923 Texas state law was unconstitutional, because it allowed the state Democratic Party to racially discriminate. After the case, most Southern states ended their selectively inclusive white primaries. They retained other devices of disenfranchisement, particularly in terms of barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes and literacy tests. These generally survived legal challenges as they applied to all potential voters, but in practice they were administered in a discriminatory manner by white officials. Although the proportion of Southern blacks registered to vote steadily increased from less than 3 percent in 1940 to 29 percent in 1960 and over 40 percent in 1964,Beyerlein, Kraig and Andrews, Kenneth T.; ‚ÄòBlack Voting during the Civil Rights Movement: A Micro-Level Analysis‚Äô; Social Forces, volume 87, No. 1 (September 2008), pp. 65-93 gains were minimal in Mississippi, Alabama, North Louisiana and southern parts of Georgia before the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Establishment and significance of white primaries Southern Democratic party chapters started to use white primaries in the late 19th century, as part of efforts to suppress black voting and weaken the Republican Party in the South. In an effort to maintain white supremacy, Democratic activists had often used violence and fraud at elections to suppress black voting. Following the temporary loss of power to the biracial coalition of Populists and Republicans in the 1890s, when Democrats regained control of state legislatures (often on campaigns based on white supremacy), they systematically adopted electoral rules in new constitutions or specific laws to disenfranchise black voters by making voter registration and voting more difficult. A number of devices were used, including poll taxes, residency requirements, record-keeping requirements and literacy tests, all administered by white officials. The Democrats sometimes protected illiterate or poor white voters by such devices as grandfather clauses, which provided exemptions to men who had ancestors who have voted or resided in certain areas as of a date that excluded blacks. Application of these measures was done in such a discriminatory way that not even educated, middle-class blacks managed to stay on the voter rolls. The Democratic Party achieved a dramatic drop in black voting across the South, with related weakening of the Republican Party in the region. White Democrats were successful in establishing and maintaining a one- party system in most southern states. They thus developed great power in Congress, controlling all seats allocated to their states, establishing seniority, and gaining critical chairmanships of important committees, which extended their power. Black citizens excluded from voting were also shut out of running for local offices, serving on juries, or in other civil offices, and were forced into second-class status. To strengthen the exclusion of minorities from the political system, Texas, Georgia and some other states established white primaries, a ‚Äúselectively inclusive‚Äù system that permitted only whites to vote in the primaries. By legally considering the general election as the only state-held election, they gave white members of the Democratic Party control of the decision-making process within the party and the state. Because the Democratic Party dominated the political systems of all the Southern states after Reconstruction, its state and local primary elections usually determined which candidate would ultimately win office in the general election. Texas cases Beginning in the early 20th century, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed numerous lawsuits in efforts to overturn discriminatory electoral and voter registration practices by Southern states. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also participated in such cases. The ACLU filed suit based on the state's having passed discriminatory legislation in violation of Constitutional amendments.Texas Politics - Smith v. Allwright (1944) - White Primaries In 1923 Texas enacted the Statute of Texas, which provided that ‚Äúin no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election held in the State of Texas.‚Äù The law was challenged by Dr. L. A. Nixon, a black member of the Democratic Party, in Nixon v. Herndon (1927). Nixon was denied a ballot in a Democratic Party primary election in Texas on the basis of the law and sued for damages under federal civil rights laws. The Court found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees ‚Äúequal protection under the law,‚Äù while not discussing his Fifteenth Amendment claim to the franchise. Following the ruling, Texas amended the statute to allow the Democratic Party's state executive committee to set voting qualifications for its primaries. The new law provided that every political party would henceforth ‚Äúin its own way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party.‚Äù Nixon sued again, in Nixon v. Condon (1932). The Supreme Court again found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Democratic Party of Texas state convention then adopted a rule banning black voting in primary elections. This revised scheme was upheld in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), where the Supreme Court held that this basis for a white primary was constitutional,Grovey v. Townsend, 295 U.S. 45 (1935) on the grounds that the political party was a private entity. Another challenge to the Texas white primaries was Smith v. Allwright (1944), which overturned Grovey v. Townsend. In that case the Supreme Court ruled that white primaries as established by Texas were unconstitutional. Though Smith v. Allwright applied directly only to the Texas law, following this ruling, most southern states ended their selectively inclusive white primaries. Activists gained the voter registration of tens of thousands of African Americans after the end of white primaries, but many were still excluded from voting as states used other discriminatory practices, including poll taxes and literacy tests (administered subjectively by white registrars) to keep African Americans from voting. 1964 Democratic National Convention African Americans continued to work to have their constitutional rights as citizens enforced. During the civil rights era of the 1960s, voter registration drives were held in southern states in efforts to work within the system. In some cases activists were assaulted or murdered, and African Americans made little progress against white determination to exclude most blacks from voting. The 1964 Democratic National Convention was controversial because of the dispute as to which delegates from Mississippi were entitled to be present and to vote. At the national convention, the integrated Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) claimed the seats for delegates for Mississippi, on the grounds that the official Mississippi delegation had been elected in violation of the party's rules, as it excluded blacks from voting. Blacks were still systematically excluded by discriminatory provisions from registering and voting in the primaries, and participating in the precinct and county caucuses and the state convention. Nevertheless, the MFDP delegates had all been elected in strict compliance with party rules. The party‚Äôs liberal leaders supported an even division of the seats between the two delegations. However, President Lyndon B. Johnson was concerned that, while the regular Democrats of Mississippi would probably vote for conservative Republican Barry Goldwater anyway, rejecting them at that time would cost Johnson the South in the presidential election. Eventually, Hubert Humphrey, Walter Reuther and black civil rights leaders, including Roy Wilkins and Bayard Rustin, worked out a compromise: two of the 68 MFDP delegates chosen by Johnson would be made at-large delegates and the remainder would be non-voting guests of the convention. The regular Mississippi delegation was required to pledge to support the national party ticket; and the Democratic Party committed to accepting in the future only those delegations chosen by non-discriminatory methods. Although Joseph Rauh, the MFDP‚Äôs lawyer, initially refused this deal, he eventually urged the MFDP to accept it. However, the MFDP delegates refused. They believed that the national party, by accepting the official all-white Mississippi delegation, had validated a process in which blacks had been denied their constitutional right for many decades to vote and participate in the political process. They believed that, because the MFDP had conducted their delegate selection process according to the party's own national rules, they should be seated as the official Mississippi delegation, not just a token two as at-large delegates. Many civil rights activists were deeply offended by the convention‚Äôs outcome. As leader (and later Representative) John Lewis said, Many white delegates from Mississippi and Alabama refused to sign any pledge, and left the convention.Unger and Unger, LBJ; a Life (1999) pp. 325-6; Dallek, Flawed Giant: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1960-1973 (1998), p. 164; In all, The next year Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, authorizing the federal government to oversee voter registration and other political practices and enforce rights in states with a history of under-representation of minority voters. Work began to register African Americans across the South, and they began to be elected to office again after decades of exclusion. By this time, nearly 6.5 million African Americans had left the South in the Great Migration to escape its oppression and seek work opportunities in the North, Midwest and West, changing the demographics of numerous cities and regions.

It was released for Amiga and DOS; the DOS release retained the Amiga 32-color palette rather than 256-color VGA graphics. In 2009, it was re-released on GOG using DOSBox with compatibility for macOS and Windows. This was the last game made by Horror Soft before they became Adventure Soft, the company known for the Simon the Sorcerer series. Waxworks inspired by the 1988 film Waxwork. Gameplay Waxworks is a first-person dungeon crawl role-playing video game. The game is divided into five different time periods: Ancient Egypt, Medieval Transylvania, Victorian England, an industrial mine period and Ixona's period. Three of those time periods have a mixture of puzzle-solving and combat, while the Victorian England and Ixona ones are more puzzle-solving oriented. The levels may be completed in any order, except for Ixona's period, which must be done last. Once a time period is completed, the player is reset to level one and loses all items and weapons, which do not transfer to other levels. The player levels up in each time period by defeating enemies, solving puzzles and exploring new areas, which increases maximum health and psychic power, the latter of which can be used to contact Uncle Boris. The player can use Uncle Boris' crystal ball to get hints and healing: the reagents needed for the healing spell depend on the level. In each time period, the player moves through a series of tight corridors using a bitmap sprite-based point-and- click interface picking up items, solving puzzles, avoiding traps and engaging in combat with various opponents. During combat, players can target their opponent's individual body parts, such as the head or arms. The main objective is to collect a special item from each of the evil twin ancestors before venturing into the Ixona period to undo the family curse. Plot Long ago, the witch Ixona stole a chicken from the player character's ancestor, who chopped off her hand as punishment. In retaliation, Ixona placed a curse on the ancestor. Whenever twins were born into his family line, one would grow up to be good while the other would become evil. At present day, the protagonist learns that his twin brother, Alex, is going to suffer the curse. Boris, their uncle, has died and left them with his eponymous waxworks in his will, as well a crystal ball, through which his spirit communicates with his nephew. The protagonist learns that he must rid the family of Ixona's curse to save Alex. He must use the waxworks to travel through four locations in different time periods: Ancient Egypt, a zombie-infested cemetery, Victorian era London and a mine overrun with plant-like mutants. Within each location, he is to defeat his evil twin who takes the shape of a villain. Eventually, the protagonist learns that the only way to break the curse is to prevent it from being cast in the first place. After defeating the evil twin four times, the protagonist is given four artifacts: the High Priest's amulet, the Necromancer's ring, Jack the Ripper's knife, and a vial of the Plant Monster's poison. The final level is unlocked, and takes the protagonist back in time to confront Ixona. Following Boris' instructions, the protagonist uses the artifacts to kill Ixona before she can place the curse. As a result, the curse is erased from existence for every afflicted generation of the protagonist's family line. After the curse is undone, the protagonist finds Alex unconscious in a corner of the Waxworks and revives him. Upon waking, Alex recalls a strange dream he had, in which he witnessed Ixona's death. However, in the dream, right before she died, Ixona muttered another curse which transformed the protagonist into a demon. The dream's meaning is never made clear, possibly hinting at a potential sequel. The game ends with the brothers leaving the museum. Development Waxworks was in development over the course of two years. In a 1992 interview with Zero magazine, designer Michael Woodroffe: \\"With the system we use, which we also invented and developed, we're able to complete a massive game such as Waxworks in about seven, eight or, at the most, nine months ... we can do everything with a small amount of people. Just three artists ... Waxworks has been put together by a team, essentially, of five.\\" In response to being asked if any of the gore had to be censored in the game due to objection from the publisher, Woodroffe responded \\"Not really, no ... [the artists are] given a total brief - which they hardly ever stick to ... but they're kept within fairly strict guidelines.\\" The game uses the AGOS engine, which is a modified version of the AberMUD 5 engine. The story for Waxworks was developed by Rick Moran. Original music was composed by Jezz Woodroffe who worked with John Canfield for the sound design. Producers Todd Thorson and Mark Wallace worked with the help of David Friedland and Tricia Woodroffe, who managed the technical resources.Waxworks (1992). Horror Soft. Accolade. Scene: Credits. Woodroffe also stated that the game was heavily inspired by the 1988 film Waxwork. Furthermore, a fight with the Marquis de Sade, who was a major character in the film, was cut from the game. Similarities between the game and the movie include time travel using waxwork displays and the artifacts belonging to those within the displays having magical properties. Woodroffe stated that there will be \\"numerous kings and queens ... There'll also be triffids\\" and that there will be a devil worship scene with \\"chanting and leaping about.\\" Some of the plant mutant traps in the finished game bear a close resemblance to Triffids. Kings and queens are absent from the game entirely, however in the Egypt level the player takes the role of a prince saving a princess from being sacrificed by a cult, but there is no chanting or outright worship depicted and the cult does not worship the devil: it is a cult of Anubis.Waxworks (1992). Horror Soft. Accolade. Scene: Egypt.Waxworks (1992). Horror Soft. Accolade. Scene: Plant Mutant Mine. In a pre-release blurb for Waxworks in Amiga Action, the introduction, particularly surrounding Uncle Boris, is different than what is in the final game. The introduction outlined in Amiga Action begins in a graveyard, rather than at Uncle Boris' waxworks, and Uncle Boris is stated to contact the protagonist telepathically, rather than with a crystal ball as in the final game. Upon visiting Boris' tomb, it is \\"blown open and the coffin disappears. Looking into the tomb, [the protagonist] sees images of himself and his brother Alex lying dead at the bottom.\\" The backstory represented in the manual and The Curse of the Twins booklet included with the game also has nothing related to this pre-release introduction, possibly indicating it was scrapped and the story was reworked before release.(1992).

Accolade. =Copy protection= At the beginning of the game, the player is prompted to enter a 4-digit code which requires the use of a 3-ply code wheel to determine the answer. The wheel has a symbol, a monster and a place on the three rings, the third ring having two different words and two different codes on several of the answers. If the player fails to enter the correct answer three times, the game closes itself and suggests that the player refer to the manual.Waxworks (1992). Horror Soft. Accolade. Scene: Introduction. Reception Many reviewers noted the game's gore, with Amiga Joker calling it \\"pretty horrible, horribly pretty\\" and \\"shocking\\", and PC Games saying \\"Waxworks is definitely only for enthusiastic horrorfreaks.\\" The One refers to Waxworks' gore as \\"very gruesome ... a lot of this stuff is genuinely stomach-turning\\". In addition, the store page for the GOG release refers to it as \\"A dungeon crawler known for its gore and death scenes.\\" Computer Gaming World criticized the small game maps, overemphasis on combat, and the IBM PC version's use of an Amiga-like 32-color palette instead of 256-color VGA graphics, but liked the \\"very atmospheric\\" soundtrack. The magazine concluded that despite flaws, the game was \\"better than most\\" CRPGs, and that \\"for those who revel in the macabre\\" ... Waxworks continues to satisfy the bent toward the supernatural\\". Computer Gaming World nominated Waxworks for game of the year under the role-playing category. The One gave the Amiga version of Waxworks an overall score of 78%, stating they \\"like the game's episodic nature - the way it's broken down into separate mini- adventures is far more suited to my tastes ... it adds variety to the fun, and as a result the game's much fresher than most run-of-the-mill RPGs\\", and complimented the game's atmosphere and express that \\"The moody graphics and soundtrack combine to create a strong sense of tension\\". The One criticized the game's gratuitous gore.

The Coast Starlight runs once daily in each direction between Los Angeles and Seattle, Washington. The Pacific Surfliner trains serving this station run ten times daily (five in each direction) between San Diego and the Santa Barbara suburb of Goleta, with two of those running in each direction to/from San Luis Obispo further to the north. The station is fully staffed with ticketing and checked- baggage services. History Santa Barbara station in a 1910 postcard The station in 2007 after renovation in 2000 The station was built in 1902 by the Southern Pacific Railroad in the Spanish Mission Revival Style. Design work was by Santa Barbara architect Francis W. Wilson. It is located within walking distance of Santa Barbara Harbor, Stearns Wharf and State Street, Santa Barbara's main thoroughfare. The historic depot was renovated in 2000; the project included the restoration of the ticket office and upgrades to the plumbing, electrical and heating and cooling systems.Great American Stations. Accessed February 20, 2013. For most of the first decade of the Amtrak era, the station was only served by the Coast Starlight, which ran southbound during the evening rush and northbound at lunchtime. In 1988, Amtrak and Caltrans extended the San Diegan, previously a Los Angeles-San Diego service, to Santa Barbara, providing an additional round trip between the Central Coast and Los Angeles. Eventually, service was extended to nearby Goleta and later all the way to San Luis Obispo, resulting in the route being rebranded as the Pacific Surfliner in 2000. Due to the length of the platform, when Amtrak's Coast Starlight train is stopped, it blocks the two streets to the north and south of the depot. Of the 74 California stations served by Amtrak, Santa Barbara was the 15th-busiest in FY2012, boarding or detraining an average of approximately 834 passengers daily, and serving a total of 304,382 passengers in FY2012.

Terminal symbols are the elementary symbols of the language defined by a formal grammar. Nonterminal symbols (or syntactic variables) are replaced by groups of terminal symbols according to the production rules. The terminals and nonterminals of a particular grammar are two disjoint sets.  Terminal symbols  Terminal symbols are literal symbols which may appear in the outputs of the production rules of a formal grammar and which cannot be changed using the rules of the grammar. Applying the rules recursively to a source string of symbols will usually terminate in a final output string consisting only of terminal symbols. Consider a grammar defined by two rules. Using pictoric marks interacting with each other: # The symbol \`◊®\` can become \`–¥–∏\` # The symbol \`◊®\` can become \`–¥\` Here \`–¥\` is a terminal symbol because no rule exists which would change it into something else. On the other hand, \`◊®\` has two rules that can change it, thus it is nonterminal. A formal language defined or generated by a particular grammar is the set of strings that can be produced by the grammar and that consist only of terminal symbols.  Nonterminal symbols  Nonterminal symbols are those symbols which can be replaced. They may also be called simply syntactic variables. A formal grammar includes a start symbol, a designated member of the set of nonterminals from which all the strings in the language may be derived by successive applications of the production rules. In fact, the language defined by a grammar is precisely the set of terminal strings that can be so derived. Context-free grammars are those grammars in which the left-hand side of each production rule consists of only a single nonterminal symbol. This restriction is non-trivial; not all languages can be generated by context-free grammars. Those that can are called context-free languages. These are exactly the languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic push down automaton. Context-free languages are the theoretical basis for the syntax of most programming languages.  Production rules  A grammar is defined by production rules (or just 'productions') that specify which symbols may replace which other symbols; these rules may be used to generate strings, or to parse them. Each such rule has a head, or left-hand side, which consists of the string that may be replaced, and a body, or right-hand side, which consists of a string that may replace it. Rules are often written in the form head ‚Üí body; e.g., the rule a ‚Üí b specifies that a can be replaced by b. In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by Noam Chomsky in the 1950s, a grammar G consists of the following components: * A finite set N of nonterminal symbols. * A finite set \\\\Sigma of terminal symbols that is disjoint from N. * A finite set P of production rules, each rule of the form :: (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^{*} N (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^{*} \\\\rightarrow (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^{*} :where {}^{*} is the Kleene star operator and \\\\cup denotes set union, so (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup N)^{*} represents zero or more symbols, and N means one nonterminal symbol. That is, each production rule maps from one string of symbols to another, where the first string contains at least one nonterminal symbol. In the case that the body consists solely of the empty string--i.e., that it contains no symbols at all--it may be denoted with a special notation (often \\\\Lambda, e or \\\\epsilon) in order to avoid confusion. * A distinguished symbol S \\\\in N that is the start symbol. A grammar is formally defined as the ordered quadruple . Such a formal grammar is often called a rewriting system or a phrase structure grammar in the literature.  Example  For instance, the following represents an integer (which may be signed) expressed in a variant of Backus‚ÄìNaur form: ::= '0'  '1'  '2'  '3'  '4'  '5'  '6'  '7'  '8'  '9' ::= ['-'] {} In this example, the symbols (-,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) are terminal symbols and and are nonterminal symbols. Note: This example supports strings with leading zeroes like \\"0056\\" or \\"0000\\", as well as negative zero strings like \\"-0\\" and \\"-00000\\". Another example is: S -> cAd A -> a  ab In this example, the symbols a,b,c,d are terminal symbols and S,A are nonterminal symbols.

It collects information similar to that collected by radiosondes carried aloft by weather balloons. It was developed by AirDat LLC, which was acquired by Panasonic Avionics Corporation in April 2013 and operated until October 2018 under the name Panasonic Weather Solutions. It is now owned by FLYHT Aerospace Solutions Ltd.  History  In response to a government aviation safety initiative in the early 2000s, NASA, in partnership with the FAA, NOAA, and private industry, sponsored the early development and evaluation of a proprietary multifunction in situ atmospheric sensor for aircraft. The predecessor to Panasonic Weather Solutions, AirDat (formerly ODS of Rapid City, SD), located in Morrisville, North Carolina and Lakewood, Colorado, was formed in 2003 to develop and deploy the Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting (TAMDAR) system based on requirements provided by the Global Systems Division (GSD) of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL), the FAA, and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The TAMDAR sensor was originally deployed in December 2004 on a fleet of 63 Saab SF340 aircraft operated by Mesaba Airlines in the Great Lakes region of the United States as a part of the NASA-sponsored Great Lakes Fleet Experiment (GLFE). Over the last twelve years, equipage of the sensors has expanded beyond the continental US to include Alaska, Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Europe, and Asia. Airlines flying the system include Icelandair, Horizon (Alaska Air Group), Chautauqua (Republic Airways), Piedmont (American Airlines), AeroM√©xico, Ravn Alaska, Hageland, PenAir, Silver Airways, and Flybe, as well as a few research aircraft including the UK Met Office BAe-146 FAAM aircraft. Recently, an installation agreement has been reached with a large Southeast Asian airline as well. The TAMDAR system has been in continuous operation since initial deployment in December 2004. In 2014 TAMDAR data began being implemented in the national mesonet program consisting of NOAA and its partners. In October 2018, Panasonic Weather Solutions was acquired by FLYHT Aerospace Solutions, which has integrated TAMDAR with its AFIRs hardware package for airplanes (providing real-time data transmission via satellite connection).  System capabilities  TAMDAR observations include temperature, pressure, winds aloft, relative humidity (RH), icing, and turbulence that are critical to both aviation safety and the operational efficiency of the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) and other world airspace management systems as well as other weather-dependent operational environments such as maritime, defense, and energy. Additionally, each observation includes GPS-derived horizontal and vertical (altitude) coordinates, as well as a time stamp to the nearest second. With a continuous stream of observations, TAMDAR provides higher spatial and temporal resolution compared to the Radiosonde (RAOB) network, as well as better geographic coverage, and a more complete data set than sent over Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which lacks RH, icing, and turbulence. Upper air observing systems are normally subject to latency based on the communication networks used and quality assurance protocol. TAMDAR observations are typically received, processed, quality controlled, and available for distribution or model assimilation in less than one minute from the sampling time. The sensor requires no flight crew involvement; it operates automatically and sampling rates and calibration constants can be adjusted by remote command from a US- based operations center. TAMDAR sensors continuously transmit atmospheric observations via a global satellite network in real-time as the aircraft climbs, cruises, and descends. The system is normally installed on fixed-wing airframes ranging from small, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to long-range wide-bodies such as the Boeing 777 or Airbus A380. Upon completion of the installations scheduled for 2015, more than 6,000 daily soundings will be produced in North America, Europe, and Asia at more than 400 locations. Emphasis has been placed on equipping regional carriers as these flights tend to (i) fly into more remote and diverse locations and (ii) be of shorter duration thereby producing more daily vertical profiles while remaining in the boundary layer for longer durations. = Icing observations = TAMDAR icing data provides the first high volume, objective icing data available to the airline industry. Ice reporting is normally available via pilot reports (PIREPs); while helpful, these subjective reports do not provide objective accuracy and density. High-density, real-time TAMDAR icing reports provide accurate spatial and temporal distribution of icing hazards, as well as real- time observations where icing is not occurring. The icing data can be made available in raw observation form, or it can be used to improve icing potential model forecasts. = Turbulence observations = The TAMDAR sensor provides objective, high-resolution eddy dissipation rate (EDR) turbulence observations. These data are collected for both median and peak turbulence measurements and are capable of being sorted on a finer (7-point) scale than current subjective pilot reports (PIREPs), which are reported as light, moderate, or severe. The EDR turbulence algorithm is aircraft-configuration and flight-condition independent, thus it does not depend on the type of plane, nor does it depend on load and flight capacity. This high-density real- time in situ turbulence data can be used to alter flight arrival and departure routes. It also can be assimilated into models to improve predictions of threatening turbulence conditions, as well as being used as a verification tool for longer-range numerical weather prediction (NWP)-based turbulence forecasts. As with the icing observations, potential utility of this data in air traffic control decision making for avoidance and mitigation of severe turbulence encounters can be significant.  Forecast models and validation  Third-party studies have been conducted by NOAA-GSD, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and various universities and government agencies to verify the accuracy of TAMDAR data against that of weather balloons and aircraft test instrumentation, as well as quantifying the TAMDAR-related impacts on NWP. Ongoing data denial experiments show that the inclusion of TAMDAR data can significantly improve forecast model accuracy with the greatest gains realized during more dynamic and severe weather events. Upper air observations are the single most important data set driving a forecast model. Fine-scale regional forecast accuracy is dependent on a representation of the mid and upper-level atmospheric flow, moisture, and wave patterns. If these features are properly analyzed during the model initialization period, then an accurate forecast will ensue. TAMDAR data has been shown to increase forecast accuracy over the U.S. on the order of 30- to 50-percent for a monthly average, even for 3D-Var (GSI) models. The FAA funded a four-year TAMDAR impact study that was concluded in January 2009. The study was conducted by the Global Systems Division (GSD) of NOAA under an FAA contract to ascertain the potential benefits of including TAMDAR data to the 3D-Var Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model, which was the current operational aviation- centric model run by National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Two parallel versions of the model were run with the control withholding the TAMDAR data. The results of this study concluded that significant gains in forecast skill were achieved with the inclusion of the data despite using 3D-Var assimilation methods. The reduction in 30-day running mean RMS error averaged throughout the contiguous United States within the boundary layer for model state variables were: * Up to 50% reduction in RH error * 35% reduction in temperature error * 15% reduction in wind error This study was conducted using a 3D-Var model on a horizontal grid. Likewise, the nature of the 30-day mean statistics dilutes the actual impact provided by TAMDAR's higher resolution data during critical weather events. The forecast skill gain during dynamic events is typically much greater than what is expressed in a monthly average covering the Lower 48. In other words, the increase in model accuracy is greatest during dynamic weather events where air traffic and other operational impacts are greatest. The Panasonic Weather Solutions RT-FDDA-WRF forecast runs on a North America domain with grid spacing and can include multiple nested domains. A four-year collaborative study with NCAR using the same data as in the studies referenced above has shown that the FDDA/4D-Var assimilation methodology can nearly double the improvement in forecast skill over an identical model running a 3D-Var configuration. Results from this study are summarized below using the same 30-day running mean verification statistics as employed by NOAA. TAMDAR impact using FDDA/4D-Var resulted in: * Reduction in humidity forecast error of 74% * Reduction in temperature forecast error of 58% * Reduction in wind forecast error of 63% Forecast skill, like the example presented above, is made possible by having (i) an asynoptic in situ observing system like TAMDAR that streams continuous real- time observations to (ii) a forecast model (deterministic or probabilistic) that has the ability to assimilate asynoptic data in four dimensions. = Skew-T profiles = TAMDAR sensors are currently set to sample at intervals on ascent and descent. This resolution can be adjusted in real-time to whatever interval is desired for the receiving forecasting model. The satellite connection to the sensor is a two-way connection so sampling rates, calibration constants, variables and parameters, and reporting frequencies can all be changed remotely from a ground-based location. The sampling rate in cruise is time-based. The soundings, or vertical profiles, are built as each observation is received. All of the profile-based variable calculations (e.g., CAPE, CIN, etc.) are calculated when an aircraft enters cruise or touches down. When an airport is selected, successive soundings can be displayed within a certain time window. This enables the user to view the evolution of the profile.

History The race was first held on Thanksgiving Day, 27 November 1969 and was fittingly named for Pocahontas, the daughter of Native-American chief Powhatan, who aided the early American settlers and the same named Pocahontas, the 19th century British-bred thoroughbred mare, who had a great influence on the breed. The stakes race remained as a Thanksgiving Day event until 1982 when it was moved to the early weeks of the Fall Meet. The event was first classified as Grade III in 2005 and a Grade II race in 2010. In 2020 the event was downgraded back to Grade III. The distance of the race originated at 7 furlongs and was run at that distance for the first 13 years from 1969 to 1981. The distance was changed to one mile beginning in 1982 and continued at that distance through 2012. In 2013, the distance was increased to miles. In 2020 the event was decreased back to 1 mile. The event was split into divisions eight times with the last occurrence in 1983. The new scheduling allowed the Pocahontas to become a major prep for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. It is a \\"Win and You're In\\" race in the Breeders' Cup Challenge series.

Development started in 1955 and the vehicle was first deployed in April 1961. The type number follows the year of deployment. A total of 560 Type 61s were manufactured between 1961 and 1975, when production ceased. It was succeeded by the Type 74. History The Empire of Japan had produced a wide range of armoured fighting vehicles. After the Surrender of Japan, however, all AFV development and construction had ceased, and Japan had lost the technology needed to build and manufacture tanks and armored vehicles. However, due to the Korean War, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers ordered Japan to re-militarize, forming an armed police force (initially the National Police Reserve, later called the National Security Force, and finally renamed the Japan Ground Self Defense Force) and provided M4A3E8 Sherman medium tanks and M24 Chaffee light tanks. These tanks had seen heavy use during World War II, and after their handover to Japan they required total mechanical overhauls in only a few years. Since a large amount of parts were being consumed on the Korean peninsula, it was necessary to produce the spares used in Japan domestically, and procedural knowledge of American style tank design and maintenance began to accumulate. Another problem shared by the Sherman and Chaffee in Japanese use was that the average Japanese crewmember was of shorter stature than American soldiers, and the tanks were considered spacious by Japanese standards. Based on this experience, the Director General of the Defense Agency ordered the to develop a new domestic tank in 1955. During the Korean War, the performance of the T-34 and M26 Pershing had made it clear that new Japanese tanks would require 90mm main guns. Among the tank officers of the JGSDF there were two design plans for the new tanks. One was a 25-ton tank, to match the difficult terrain of Japan, with its paddy fields and weak ground. The other was a 35-ton tank, more than big enough to carry a 90mm gun. Both plans had advantages and disadvantages, but after intense discussion, the 35-ton design was adopted. From 1956 to 1960, a series of four prototypes, numbered STA1 to STA4, were produced, and testing began in 1957. STA3/4 were satisfactory for JGSDF and introduced into service in April 1961. Design Type 61 tanks on the move in 1985 as part of a joint US/Japanese exercise. The Type 61 is conventionally laid out, with a central turret and the engine located at the rear of the hull. The tank has a crew of four: a commander, driver, gunner and loader. The hull is welded steel, with a cast steel turret. The maximum armour thickness is quoted as 64 millimeters. The driver sits at the front right of the hull, with a hatch immediately above him, and three vision periscopes covering the forward arc. To the driver's left is the transmission, which can be accessed for servicing by removing a large panel on the front of the hull. The commander and gunner sit in the turret on the right side, with the commander provided with a large domed cupola with a hatch on the rear of it. The gunner does not have a hatch and is seated forward of the commander. A tool storage box was normally mounted externally on the rear of the bustle, and three smoke grenade launchers were mounted on each side of the turret. Two large radio antenna were also attached to the rear of the bustle. =Engine and drive= The tank was powered by a 570 horsepower Mitsubishi HM21 WT V12 turbocharged diesel mounted at the rear of the hull and exhausting through pipes on either side of the rear of the hull. The engine is coupled to a Mitsubishi manual transmission system which uses a controlled differential steering system. The track is driven from the front, and has six rubber road wheels on each side along with three return rollers. The suspension is a torsion bar system with the first, second and sixth road wheel fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers. At the beginning, Japanese engineers intended to adopt the cross drive system studied by observing the repair work of the M47 Patton of the American military which was done in Japan, but did not realize it. =Armaments= A M36 tank destroyer was rented around 1955 and was used as a reference material for the mounting method of 90mm gun. During this period, tanks armed with 100 mm high-caliber cannons began to appear outside Japan, so using a similarly large calibre gun in the new domestically produced tanks was considered. But after examining the M36, 90mm ammunition was felt to be the upper limit of what an average Japanese tanker could handle effectively. Additionally, due to the mountainous landscape of Japan, it was unlikely that long range engagements would occur frequently and it was thought that a 90 millimeter gun would be sufficient. Based on this decision, a Type 61 90 millimeter calibre rifled gun was adopted as its main gun. The gun is fitted with a t-shaped muzzle brake, which diverts firing gases sideways, and reduces the amount of dust kicked up by firing. Its breech uses a horizontally sliding breechblock for loading the fixed cartridge cases. The loader is provided with a small hatch, which has a small flap in it for ejecting spent shell cases by hand. Storage is provided for eighteen rounds in the bustle at the rear of the turret, with additional rounds being distributed in various positions inside the tank. The commander's cupola has four vision blocks, which are angled upward, and a one-meter base stereoscopic rangefinder with x7 magnification. The gunner has a x6 magnification periscope, as well as a √ó6 magnification sight. A M1919A4 7.62 mm machine gun is mounted next to the gun as a coaxial machine gun, and a M2 12.7 mm machine gun is normally mounted on the commander's cupola for anti-aircraft use. Deployment history The initial production rate was low, with only ten tanks produced in 1961 and 1962, increasing to twenty in 1964 and thirty in 1965 and 1966. A total of 250 had been produced by 1970, with production continuing at an increased pace until 1975, when it was terminated. A total of 560 were produced. The tanks were phased out of service in the 1990s, with 400 in service in 1990, and 190 in service in 1995. All were decommissioned by 2000, 39 years after their original deployment. During this period, the Type 61 received minor upgrades in the form of infra red searchlights and/or smoke dischargers. From 1980, Type 61's began to be supplemented by the more modern Type 74 MBT. =Operators= * ‚Äì 560 in service between 1961 and 2000 =Variants= * Type 67 AVLB (Armored vehicle launch bridge) (67ÂºèÊà¶ËªäÊ©ã) * Type 70 ARV (Armored Recovery Vehicle) (70ÂºèÊà¶ËªäÂõûÂèéËªä) See also * Type 74 * Type 90 * Type 10 Notes References = Books =  External links * The history of Type61 JGSDF MANIACS Category:Main battle tanks of the Cold War Category:Main battle tanks of Japan Category:Cold War military equipment of Japan Category:Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Category:Mitsubishi Heavy Industries armored vehicles Category:History of the tank ","title":"Type 61 (tank)"},{"id":"7689148","text":"Chinese Marine Corps may refer to: *Republic of China Marine Corps *People's Liberation Army Marine Corps ","title":"Chinese Marine Corps"},{"id":"7689158","text":"Quine may refer to: * Quine (surname), people with the surname Quine * Willard Van Orman Quine, the philosopher, or things named after him: ** Quine (computing), a program that produces its source code as output ** Quine‚ÄìMcCluskey algorithm, an algorithm used for logic minimization ** Quine's paradox, in logic ** Duhem‚ÄìQuine thesis, in philosophy of science ","title":"Quine"},{"id":"7689167","text":"Frederick H. Evans (born November 6, 1983) is an American football defensive tackle who is currently a free agent. He was drafted by the Dolphins in the seventh round (212th overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. He played college football at College of DuPage for two years before transferring to Texas State. Early years Evans was a two-way starting lineman at Chicago's Morgan Park High School, which is generally recognized as one of the top five high schools in the Chicago Public School system.Fred Evans , Texas State University-San Marcos. Accessed August 30, 2007. While there he played alongside future NFL linebacker Corey Mays. College career =Dupage= Evans played two seasons for the Chaparrals at College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. He earned Second-Team All-North Central Community College Conference (N4C) honors as well as All-Region IV at the school known as the Midwest's largest single campus community college. He played on the offensive line as a sophomore after being moved from defensive line where he played his rookie year. =Texas State= At Texas State in 2004, Evans was moved back to the defensive line during the first week of spring practices. He registered 33 total tackles for the Bobcats, including 17.5 for losses to account for -61 yards. He had 26 solo stops and 14 assists in his first season for the Bobcats and led the team with 6.5 quarterback sacks for 35 lost yards. He also had a pass breakup and officially was credited with five quarterback hurries. He forced a fumble in the Bobcats' game against Division I-A Florida Atlantic. He was credited with at least a share of a quarterback sack in each of Texas State's first three games. He registered 4.5 tackles, including four solo hits, in the Bobcats' game at Baylor and had two tackles for loss against the Big 12 Conference school, including a quarterback sack and was credited with a quarterback hurry. As a senior in 2005, Evans earned a First-Team All- Southland Conference selection for the second straight year. He registered 55 total tackles, 24 solo stops and 31 assists during the year. He led the Southland Conference with five quarterback sacks for 35 lost yards and 18 tackles for 72 lost yards. He had at least one tackle for loss in the Bobcats' first five games. He participated in the Hula Bowl after the season. Professional career =Miami Dolphins= Evans was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the seventh round (212th overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft and signed a four-year contract on July 26, 2006. He had a fairly impressive preseason as a rookie, but was active for only one of the 16 regular season contests. He made his NFL debut in the season finale against the Indianapolis Colts on December 31 and had two tackles. In the early morning of 2007-06-23 Evans was arrested in Miami Beach. According to the police report, Evans was in a dispute with a taxi driver, and refused to leave the cab at the request of the officers called to the scene. Evans reportedly engaged in a physical struggle with the officers when they tried to handcuff him, with one officer being bitten on his left wrist. The officers then used tasers to subdue Evans. He was charged with battery on a police officer, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and trespassing. Complicating matters could be the fact that Evans is already on probation in Colorado County, Texas, for possession of marijuana. In a team-released statement, Dolphins head coach Cam Cameron said: \\"We are aware that Fred Evans was arrested this morning. We will not condone this type of behavior. I assure everyone it will be dealt with seriously\\". Cameron made good on his word a few days later, as Evans was waived by the team on June 28. =Minnesota Vikings= Evans then signed with the Minnesota Vikings. However, he had limited playing time as a backup for the Vikings premier lineman Pat Williams. Evans played in 11 games and finished the year with 3 tackles and 1 sack. In 2008, Fred Evans played in all 16 games. December 21 in a week sixteen game against the Atlanta Falcons, Evans made his first NFL start due to Williams injuring his shoulder the week before. Evans would go to start the following week and in the wild card playoff game.(where he recovered a fumble after Jared Allen stripped the ball from Donovan McNabb) A restricted free agent in the 2009 offseason, Evans re-signed with the Vikings on April 6. On March 13, 2014, Evans re-signed with the Vikings on a one-year deal.

Corner is a professionally registered landscape architect and the principal of James Corner Field Operations, a landscape architecture and urban design practice based in New York City.  Life and career  Born in 1961, Corner received a Bachelor's degree with first class honors in 1983 at Manchester Metropolitan University in England. He then received a Master's Degree in Landscape Architecture and Urban Design Certificate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1986. He was employed by Wallace, Roberts and Todd on the New Jersey Hudson River Waterfront Development; for Richard Rogers and Partners on the redevelopment of the Royal Docks in London; and for William Gillespie and Partners on the design and implementation of the International Garden Festival Park in Liverpool. Corner began teaching at the University of Pennsylvania in 1988 where he taught courses in media and theory, as well as design studios. He was elected Chair of the Landscape Architecture Department in 2000. As a professor, Corner's landscape design and environmental research and teaching interests are based upon \\"developing innovative approaches toward landscape architectural design and urbanism.\\" He has also served as a visiting professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1998 and at the KTH School of Architecture in Stockholm, Sweden in 1999. Corner's practice, Field Operations, was initially formed in collaboration with architect Stan Allen, but the partners chose to focus on their individual practices in 2005. The firm is at the forefront of the landscape urbanism movement, an interdisciplinary approach that, in theory, amalgamates a wide range of disciplines including landscape architecture, urban design, landscape ecology, and engineering, among other subjects. Corner argues that it is an approach that focuses on process rather than a style and that it marks a productive attitude toward indeterminacy, open-endedness, inter-mixing, and cross-disciplinarity.Livesey, G. (2009) \\"A Look at Landscape Urbanism\\". Canadian Architect (November 2009), pg 45-47  Works  Corner's designs bring back the open spaces of the natural wild with a rough, natural, and ecologically sound approach; this could be compared to the works of Frederick Law Olmsted, except more unbridled. *The High Line is a -long stretch of abandoned railroad viaduct that runs from the Meatpacking district to Hell's Kitchen. The proposed design by Field Operations is meant to transform it into a -long park. Corner envisioned \\"fantastic, mixed perennial landscape\\" interspersed by \\"event spaces.\\" Since its completion,it has made an impact on the surrounding blocks with the addition of 27 new residential towers, hotels, offices, and museums. *Corner's Field Operations headed up a team that won the international design competition with its \\"Lifescape\\" design for the redesign of Fresh Kills Park, a project intended to salvage a massive landfill on Staten Island. The landfill is the largest in the country at , or three times the size of Central Park in Manhattan. Today, it is one of the largest publics work projects in the world. The winning design incorporates a World Trade Center memorial, because the landfill was temporarily reopened to accommodate the remains of the towers, as well as a strong, central focus on programs, habitat, and circulation throughout the new park. Fresh Kills Park is reminiscent of Olmsted's massive design for Central Park as far as work load, scale, and project purpose and design. Fresh Kills Park is said to be \\"one of the most ambitious public works projects in the world,\\" considering 45% of the area is landfill and the remaining land is wetlands and lowlands. The goal of Fresh Kills Park is to create a world class large-scale park which restores the ecological systems, yet allows New York to optimize its local and regional access while reducing traffic congestion. The park will be developed as a setting for a range of outdoor activities, programs, and recreation that are unique to New York. *Cornell NYC Tech campus - Landscape design for the new high tech college campus on the site of the Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital on Roosevelt Islandhttps://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/10/silicon-valley- comes-to-roosevelt-island.html *The Underline, a similar concept to the High Line, a linear park that would run for from Brickell to Dadeland in Miami, Florida. *Cleveland Public Square is a 10 acre civic space in the heart of downtown Cleveland originally conceived in 1796.

Books  A new aspect of Corner's approach, one that was responsible for his receiving the Chrysler Design Institute Award in 2000, is his plan of working with graphic artists, photographers, and other artists from various fields. An example of this is the project Corner and photographer Alex MacLean completed when they published their Taking Measures Across the American Landscape which is a journey to explore the types of landscapes in the United States through essays and map drawings by Corner and aerial photos taken by McLean. * (with Alex McLean) Taking Measures Across the American Landscape (Yale, 1996) Received the AIA International Book of the Year Award and the ASLA Award of Honor. * Recovering Landscape: Essays in Contemporary Landscape Architecture (Princeton Architectural Press, 1999) , a book focused on the revitalization of landscape architecture as a critical cultural practice, it offers insight on how contemporary landscapes are \\"designed, constructed and culturally valued\\". * (editor with Lynn Margulis and Brian Hawthorne) Ian McHarg: conversations with students: dwelling in nature (Princeton Architectural Press, 2006) * (with Michael Spens and Peter Latz) Landscapes Transformed (Academy Editions, 1996), 112 pages. .

Holmes Perkins Award for \\"distinguished and innovative teachings and methods of instruction in design\\". The following year, in 1997, he was the first recipient of the Jens Jensen Professorship in Landscape Architecture and Urbanism at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Architecture and in 2000 he was the second landscape architect, after Achva Benzinberg Stein, to be chosen for the Daimler-Chrysler Award, which recognizes and promotes innovative design. In 2018, as the first landscape architect ever, James Corner received the honorary doctorate degree (Dr.-Ing. e.h.) from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, Department of Architecture. In 2019, he received an honorary Doctorate of Design (DDes) from Manchester Metropolitan University https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/about-us/honorary- graduates/2019/.

This law was a continuation of a 1947 temporary law. The old law was a proposal by Willem Drees, while the new one came about when he was prime minister. It is the one thing he is remembered for most and his name is immortalised in the expression 'van Drees trekken' (literally 'drawing from Drees' after the Dutch word 'steuntrekken' for receiving social security). The law provides a pension from an AOW age which increases with time for everyone who has lived in the Netherlands during the 50 years before his age catches up with the AOW age (2016: 65 years and 6 months; 2017: 65 years and 9 months). For those who have not lived in the Netherlands for a full 50 years, the amount is proportional. If a pensioner has a common household with someone else (for example in the case of marriage or cohabitation), whether also a pensioner or not, the monthly amount is lower than if he or she lives alone.

The school was founded as Lott Road Christian Grade School in 1969, and was located in Eight Mile, Alabama for nineteen years until moving to its current location in 1988. The school changed its name during the 1971-1972 school year to reflect its emphasis on faith. School history Faith Academy was first envisioned in early 1967 at a men's prayer meeting of Lott Road Baptist Church in Eight Mile, Alabama. Desiring to provide quality Christian education for white only children at a time when school desegregation was occurring in Alabama, they opened Lott Road Christian Grade School. The school was begun in a single, two-story building located behind the church in 1969. The school had 170 students in grades one through six and eight teachers. The name was changed to Faith Academy during the 1971-1972 school year. The school grew rapidly; by the school year 1972-1973, enrollment increased to 547 students in grades one through twelve. Kindergarten was added in the 1975-1976 school year. Faith Academy remained in Eight Mile for nineteen years, but moved to the present site on Tanner Williams Road in Mobile, Alabama, in the summer of 1988. The enrollment remained at approximately 500 students in grades kindergarten through twelve. During the 1990-1991 school year, the school was accredited by the Alabama Independent School Association. Extracurricular activities Athletics The Boys Basketball team has won five consecutive regionals, won three consecutive regional titles and three consecutive state semifinals. In 2015, the team won USA Today Best Boys Basketball Program contest with over 568,000 votes. In 2014 and 2015, they have been ranked No. 1 in Class 5A. The school's baseball team was coached by Lloyd Skoda for 29 non-consecutive years, who continues to teach other classes at the school. Skoda, who retired in 2013 after celebrating his 900th win, won 11 AISA state tiles at Faith and was inducted into the Alabama Baseball Association Hall of Fame in 2003. With a 2.2 million dollar baseball/softball facility, Faith has the top baseball facility in southeast Alabama. Football is led by Lance Lawley, who took the reins after Gary Caldwell and Rusty Mason both stepped down. Faith football proved very successful in the AISA but has struggled since moving to the AHSAA. In 2003, Caldwell alongside head coach Robby James \\"helped transform the program from an AISA doormat into a state title contender,\\" compiling 72-22 record in eight seasons under James. The Rams fell to 3-7 in 2008 in the first season as part of the AHSAA ranks, and James resigned in 2009. Caldwell was promoted to head coach but resigned after three consecutive losing seasons. Missions In 2014, after ten years of planning, Faith Academy opened a school in Ghana, West Africa. Notable alumni * P.J.

It was then expanded and redecorated by Ange-Jacques Gabriel for Madame du Barry in the 18th century, and the music (or reception) pavilion was constructed by Claude Nicolas Ledoux (1770‚Äì71). The pavilion sits in the middle of a park that was designed in the 19th century. The Ch√¢teau The ch√¢teau is an approximately cubic construction, of average size and modest appearance, which borders the chemin de la Machine (n¬∞ 6), a favourite subject of the Impressionists Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley. =History= In 1684, Louis XIV ordered the construction of a ch√¢teau in the proximity of an aqueduct built to bring water drawn from the Seine by the Machine de Marly to the Ch√¢teau de Marly. The king gave the building to Baron Arnold de Ville, the engineer of Li√®ge who had conceived the hydraulic installation. The building was later given to Louise-Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, the eldest legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and his mistress Fran√ßoise-Ath√©na√Øs, marquise de Montespan. At Louise's death in 1743, the ch√¢teau passed to her daughter, the Princesse de Conti, who introduced Madame de Pompadour to court. At some point, the building reverted to the crown. It was then used by the Prince de Lamballe. Lamballe was heir to the vast wealth of the House of Bourbon- Penthi√®vre; he was brother-in-law to Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orl√©ans (later Philippe √âgalit√©) and the husband of Marie-Th√©r√®se Louise de Savoie. He died at the ch√¢teau in 1768 of a venereal disease. In 1769, Louis XV offered the ch√¢teau to his new favourite, Madame du Barry. She probably called upon Ange- Jacques Gabriel, Premier Architecte du Roi, to enlarge and redecorate the building. Gabriel added the adjoining eastern wing, as well as the decoration of carved woodwork. Louis XV often visited the ch√¢teau that had become known as the Ch√¢teau de Madame du Barry. It is there that, 22 September 1793, Madame du Barry was arrested during the French Revolution. In the 1980s, the ch√¢teau was acquired by a Japanese heiress, Nakahara Kiiko, from \\"Dogs and Demons: Tales From the Dark Side of Modern Japan\\" and her Marseillais-born French- American husband illegally using the name of her family's company Nippon Sangyo, as a commercial asset. The couple sold all the furniture and left the building abandoned. They were sued by the company later. Occupied by squatters, the ch√¢teau underwent various degradations. In 1994, an attempt to remove the joinery and a chimneypiece was thwarted by the police. The owner then put the property up for sale, and it was bought by a French investor who carefully restored it. =Gallery of Residents= Image:Louis XIV of France.jpgLouis XIV Image:The Duchess of Maine depicted as Cleopatra by Fran√ßois de Troy.jpgLouise-Fran√ßoise de Bourbon Image:Madame la princesse de Lamballe by Antoine-Fran√ßois Callet (circa 1776, Callet).jpgPrincesse de Lamballe Image:Madame Dubarry1.jpgMadame du Barry by Vig√©e Le Brun 1783 The Pavilion \\"Pavillon de Louveciennes in 2009 The ch√¢teau was disadvantaged by its lack of a view of the Seine. Moreover, Madame du Barry considered the reception areas to be inadequate. She thus decided to build, surveying the valley of the Seine, a small separate house that would include reception rooms, the famous Pavillon de Louveciennes. =History= Proposals were requested of Charles de Wailly and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. In spite of the negative opinions given by several of her circle, notably Gabriel, Mme du Barry decided to retain the project of Ledoux, then at the beginning of his career. The design was completed in 1770 and construction was carried out in 1771. The inauguration took place on 2 September 1771 in the presence of the King. A play by Charles Coll√© was performed, La partie de chasse de Henri IV,\\"The hunting-party of Henri IV\\". and dinner was served with music (the musicians complained about the exiguity of the platforms of the dining room, now shut off by mirrors) followed by a display of fireworks. In 1773, Mme du Barry, obviously satisfied with the pavilion, ordered from Ledoux the plans for a large ch√¢teau which was to incorporate the small building. The death of Louis XV in 1774 put an end to this project before it was begun. The pavilion thus remained in its original state until the second half of the 19th century. On an unspecified date, it was disfigured by the addition of a Mansard roof and shutters to the windows. Pavillon de Louveciennes: ground floor plan shows the rich variety of shapes When it was acquired in 1923 by the perfumer Fran√ßois Coty from the politician and industrial Louis Loucheur, the house was found to be subject to a grave disorder because of the sinking slope on which it was built. Fran√ßois Coty called upon the architect Charles √âdouard Mew√®s, son of Charles Mew√®s (1860‚Äì1914) to displace it several meters. This radical solution saved the building from erosion of the slope, which would have entirely destroyed it within the next few years. The move was accompanied by profound transformations: the mansard roof was converted into an attic sheltering five bedrooms, while vast dependences were created in the basement to arrange a perfume laboratory, an electric generator, kitchens and a swimming pool. In 1959, the house was bought by the American School of Paris, which then settled there. In cleaning the building some Nazi materials were found. The story was that while the Germans occupied the building in World War II, the French Resistance was active in the tunnels of the old stone quarries under the building. These quarries had provided some of the stone used to build Paris. The school wanted to expand by putting up new buildings but the underlying tunnels made the ground unstable. A project was initiated to pump cement into the tunnels but this was abandoned, and the American School moved to another site in Saint Cloud. =Architecture= The pavilion of Louveciennes is one of the most successful achievements of Ledoux and a prototype for neoclassical architecture. The entry, in the form of an open semi-circular apse, with a coffered half-dome ceiling simply closed by a screen of Ionic columns, has a disposition already used by Ledoux in the house of Marie-Madeleine Guimard on the roadway of Antin. The coffered domes would have been an astonishing feature to Parisians, Eriksen has observed. It leads to a room which has the form of a square with apsidal ends, intended as a dining room, where the inaugural dinner took place. Behind this room is an enfilade of three living rooms, the central salon du Roi flanked by salons that are each of a different plan, opening onto the view of the Seine below. Various services and the kitchen were established in the rusticated half- basement. Pavillon de Louveciennes ‚Äì View on the side of the Seine River. The side towards the Seine is known from a drawing made by the British neoclassicist Sir William Chambers:Now in the Royal Institute of British Architects; it is Eriksen's plate 79. Chambers also made a careful pen-and-ink drawing of Ledoux's contemporaneous house for Mlle Guimard (Eriksen's plate 77). in Chambers' drawing, unlike Ledoux's commemorative engraving (illustration, right), its three central bays project in the accustomed Gabriel manner, with attached Ionic columns and bas-relief panels above the severely plain window openings; in the flanking single bays the windows have plain entablatures surmounted by low plinths of concave profile. Ledoux's commemorative engraving of 1804The engravings were published by Ledoux in De 'l'architecture consid√©r√©e sous le rapport des arts, des m≈ìurs et de la l√©gislation, Paris, 1804 (noted in Eriksen 1974:62). carries the severe fa√ßade right across, unbroken; Ledoux's drawings, executed long afterwards, cannot be trusted to represent the original appearance, according to Svend Eriksen (Eriksen 1974:62, 66), because the architect was in the habit of furnishing his drawings \\"with impossibly advanced features retrospectively.\\" In either version the elevation reflects \\"Ledoux's efforts to accentuate the cuboidal structure of a building and to handle the Classical motifs with such precision and economy that the large, reticent wall-surfaces against which they are seen are rendered doubly significant and effective\\" (Eriksen 1974:66). =Interior decoration= Cross-section of the entry and the salon du roi The interiors were finished and furnished with exceptional elegance. They had gilt-bronze wall-lights and other ornaments, designed by Ledoux in an advanced neoclassical taste and executed by Pierre Gouthi√®reTo the astonishing sum of 100,000 livres (Eriksen 1974: 188) and straight-legged chairs by the prominent menuisier Louis Delanois, in the neoclassical style we know as \\"Louis Seize\\". There are some surviving chairs of the suite, which was already in production in 1769 and must at first have been intended for the ch√¢teau, though they were used in the pavilion and are seen in Moreau le Jeune's drawing (illustration, left). The original state of the interiors is known by way of a drawing by Moreau the Younger representing the dinner offered to Louis XV by Mme du Barry for the inauguration of the house, which can be compared with an engraving by Ledoux. The pilasters were of gray scagliola with gilt-bronze capitals supplied by Gouthi√®re. The girandole lights suspended in front of the mirrors between the pilasters were semi-circular, so that with their reflection in the mirrors they appeared to be circular chandeliers hanging in space, a useful trompe l'≈ìil to enlarge the somewhat cramped space, which was essentially an enlarged vestibule between the entrance and the Salon du Roi. Mme du Barry commissioned from Jean-Honor√© Fragonard a suite of four large paintings for Louveciennes. The painter, who attached much importance to this commission, represented The Progress of Love. However, his masterpieces displeased the commissioner, the reason for the displeasure is still argued by art historians. A 19th century reading claimed that the \\"lovers\\" in the series bore too close a resemblance to du Barry and the King. A later theory was that the paintings were in the Rococo style and du Barry's pavilion was decidedly Neo Classical, thus clashing terribly. After du Barry refused the paintings, Fragonard stored them at his studio in the Louvre. In 1790 Fragonard, his wife and son found themselves living with a cousin, Alexandre Maubert, in Grasse. As part of their room and board, Fragonard sold his cousin the four panels and painted two more large panels (Reverie and The Triumph of Love), four over- door images of cupids and two long hollyhock panels. The works stayed in the family until the mid-1880s when they were sold to the industrialist J. P. Morgan. Since 1915, they have been one of the gems of the Frick Collection in New York.

Vien's neoclassical manner was gaining in popularity at the time and appeared particularly appropriate for the decor she had created in Louveciennes. The Park La Baigneuse by Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain stood in the park (Louvre Museum) In 1772, to decorate the park, Louis XV gave Mme du Barry the Bather, which Christophe- Gabriel Allegrain had exhibited in the Salon of 1767 (illustration, right). In 1776 Mme du Barry commissioned from Allegrain a pendant bather, completed in 1778; as V√©nus and Diane they offered an allegory of sensuous and of chaste love. Both are now conserved in the Louvre Museum. In 1852, the property was expanded to the banks of the Seine, but was divided into two lots. The first, including the ch√¢teau, was acquired by the banker Solomon Goldschmidt, whose heirs had it built upon by the architect Henri Goury, in 1898. The entry was in the Louis XV style, flanking the two houses, located at n¬∞ 6 chemin de la Machine. The same architect also built the stables. The second lot included the pavilion by Ledoux, equipped with two entries built by the architect Pasquier (one, located n¬∞ 28 route de la Princesse and the other in Rennequin- Sualem quay in Bougival); it was acquired by a rich American from Baltimore, Alice Thal de Lancey, mistress of the banker Nissim de Camondo, who had met her through Arthur Meyer. Edmond de Goncourt made fun of \\"the ironic interior of Louveciennes, where Mme du Barry lived and where lives today Mme de Lancey and where the banker Camondo replaces Louis XV.\\"Edmond de Goncourt, Journal, 3 June 1882. The park contains two small temples: * One, of the Ionic order, dates undoubtedly from the 18th century and is sometimes attributed without proof to Ledoux or to Richard Mique; * The other, of the Doric order, was built by the architect Henri Goury at the end of the 19th century. =See also= Paintings by Joseph-Marie Vien for the Ch√¢teau de Mme du Barry (at the official site of the Mus√©e du Louvre): * Amant couronnant sa ma√Ætresse, 1773, 3,35 m x 2,02 m. * Jeunes Grecques parant de fleurs l'Amour endormi, 1773, 3,35 m x 1,94 m.

History Qasimabad Town/City is named after the Arab Invader Muhammad Bin Qasim who invaded Sindh and Multan. It was formed as an extension to the city of Hyderabad after the arrival of migrants from across the border after the 1947 independence of Pakistan, along with the town of Latifabad. The locals that lived in the town at its inception were ethnically of a mixed population but as the city experienced ethnic riots between Sindhis and Muhajir in the late 1980s. Widespread target killings and acts of ethnic cleansing were committed, the city got divided between the Sindhis and Muhajir with the former mainly settling in Qasimabad while the latter settling in Latifabad. Smaller scale hostilities still continue in the city. Settlement Qasimabad has main concentration of Sindhi-speaking people that make more than 99% of the population of the town/City, known as the Sindhis based . Although it was formed after the town of Latifabad, it does not follow the numbered unit system for that town, but instead based on the block system. Every year thousands of Sindhi speaking from rural settle to the Qasimabad town/City. The town/City consists of the western part of the Hyderabad city and houses three of the most popular and biggest schools in the city: St Bonaventure's High School, The City School and Beaconhouse School System Universal Science College & Academy, along with other popular schools such as: BAHRIA Foundation College, Agha Taj Muhammad High School, one of oldest schools in Qasimabad town, Eden Grammar School and Sindh Academy High School, St Mary's convent school, Khan Muhammad High School. Anna English School is also running successfully from 15 years and it is located in the heart of Qasimabad town/City. Culture and society With people, mostly Sindhi, occupying this region, the practice of Sindhology or the study of Sindh is more pronounced in this region than others. There is a museum celebrating the treasures of its Sindhi cultural values and traditions present in this town, the Sindh Museum.

Geography  The municipality is located in southern Burgenland, on the border with Hungary, near Bozsok and Szombathely. The highest mountain in Burgenland, the Geschriebenstein, and the most eastern foothills of the Alps are partially located within the municipality.  History  Until 1920/21, the village was a part of Hungary, as was the entire state of Burgenland. Ever since 1898 the Hungarian name Rohonc had to be used, due to the policies of the Budapest government. In 1919, after the end of World War I, Burgenland was awarded to Austria through the treaties of St. Germain and Trianon. Since 1921, the village has been a part of the Austrian state of Burgenland. Rechnitz Massacre Near the end of World War II, some 200 Hungarian Jews were murdered near Rechnitz. In 2007, British journalist David Litchfield published an essay in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung alleging that the murders were carried out by a group of locals who had gathered for a party at the castle of the Countess of Batthyany, born Margit Thyssen-Bornemisza. Litchfield wrote that the party and the killing were organized by Nazi commander Hans Joachim Oldenburg, her lover, and that at some point during the evening of 24‚Äì25 March 1945, guns were handed out to party guests and 200 Jewish forced laborers who were being housed at the manor were hunted down and killed as entertainment. Afterwards the guests returned to the castle to continue the party. A number of notable historians have disputed Litchfield's version of the massacre, among them anti-Semitism researcher Wolfgang Benz and Winfried Garscha of the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance. Garscha states that the Nazis had already made plans to murder the 200 Jewish prisoners, who were considered too weak and sick to march on ahead of the rapidly-advancing Soviet army, before the Countess's party, and that the killings were in fact carried out by Nazi soldiers under orders from their superiors and not by civilian party guests: \\"It was indisputably a mass murder but it didn't arise from a party whim. People incapable of marching were murdered everywhere at the time.\\" Sources differ as to the evidence. Some say that at the end of the 1960s, some of the bodies of the victims were found by accident ‚Äì 18 corpses were exhumed and moved to a Jewish cemetery in Graz. Then the trail died for another 30 years, finally revived by a documentary film Stecken, Stab und Stangl, by Erne/Heinrich, the essay by Litchfield, and the play Rechnitz (der W√ºrgeengel) by Elfriede Jelinek. , the bodies of the remaining victims have still not been found.Historians Dispute Journalist's Claims: Mass Murder as Party Entertainment?, Der Spiegel The incident was followed five days later by the nearby Deutsch Sch√ºtzen massacre.

It was designed in 1769 by architect Claude Nicolas Ledoux and built in 1770-74 and 1776-80 at the request of Hyppolite-Fran√ßois Sanguin, marquis of Livry (1715‚Äì1789) and his marquise Th√©r√®se Bonne Gillain de B√©nouville, heiress of the property. The interior was under construction from 1778 to 1780 under the direction of Jean-Fran√ßois-√âtienne Gilet, the architect of Caen. In 1792, it was purchased from the widowed marquise by a fermier g√©n√©ral (tax collector) who was guillotined in 1794. His daughter inherited the property which remained in that family until 1927. It then became the property of the general council of Calvados which turned it into a maternity hospital (singer G√©rard Lenorman was born there). In 1980, it was rehabilitated and restored, opening its doors to the public in 1990. coffered coves This ch√¢teau is one of the best preserved works of Ledoux, making it a major monument of neoclassical architecture at the end of the eighteenth century. Its monumental staircase (illustrated, left) and its somewhat severe exterior architecture were very modern for the time. The ch√¢teau is located on the west side of the Canal de Caen √† la Mer, on the southeast edge of the town of B√©nouville, and just southwest of the Pegasus Bridge, made memorable on D-Day, 1944. During WW II the ch√¢teau/maternity hospital was run since 1935 by Madame Lea Vion surnamed 'la comtesse', director (from 1947-1953 she was even mayor of Benouville) who also led a resistance group of the GMO belonging to the r√©seau 'Centurie'. The maternity hospital became a hearth of resistance for the region: fugitive allied pilots and French youngsters unwilling to work for the Germans found a safe haven here. Weapons and a maquis-wireless transmitter were hidden here. Vion was in frequent contact with resistance activists Leonard Gille, Rene Duchez and Henri Leveille. One of her informants was Georges Gondr√©e, the caf√© owner near the bridge over the Caen Canal, who secretly collected information on German defences there for the benefit of D Company 2nd Ox and Bucks under Major John Howard who would storm the bridge successfully in the night before D-Day. Via Madame Vion this important information from Gondree was sent through to England. On D-Day morning soldier Wally Parr, a sniper from the Ox and Bucks, fired some grenades from a German 3.7 cm anti tank-gun towards and over the ch√¢teau, because he erroneously thought German snipers to be present upon the roof of the building after he had seen 'something flickering'(most probably the fieldbinoculars of an observing German Lieutenant). Major Howard made him stop this dangerous activity. Howard told Parr there were women in labour inside the chateau. At this very same moment, however, German Lieutenant Hans Hoeller, artillery officer from 8. Kompanie (Schwere Waffen), 192. Panzergrenadierregiment, Kampfgruppe Rauch, 21st Panzerdivision was standing on top of the ch√¢teau together with a sergeant and soldier in order to observe the canal bridge. Earlier Hans Hoeller had frustratingly found that his anti-tank troop could not pass through Benouville, because of too heavy resistance from British parachutists belonging to A Company, 7th Para Battalion under command of Nigel Taylor. He sought a suitable place to set up his batteries. Madame Vion had tried in vain to stop Lt. Hoeller from entering the \\"chateau\\". Hoeller and his colleagues were subsequently forced by Wally Parr's grenades to retreat downstairs immediately before opening their own fire on the Ox and Bucks defending the canal bridge nearby.

The property lies along State Route 1 and consists of a number of named beaches including Arched Rock Beach, Gleason Beach and Goat Rock Beach. The ecosystem consists of alternating sandy beaches and rocky shoreline, with a marine terrace extending above the entire extent with an upland California coastal prairie habitat. Geology This strip of coastal property is subject to continuing marine erosion as well as windborne erosion, thus creating a situation where an average of one to three feet (30 to 90 cm) per year of land mass is lost. Obviously in years of heavy storms this value can be higher, whereas, in a less stormy year the land erosion can be lower. Over the last geologic epoch the land has been subject to uplift, a process which has created a marine terrace of the entire extent of the property. This marine terrace is elevated approximately 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 meters) above mean sea level, which results in a steep bluff directly above the littoral zone. Vertical rock formations are a geological hallmark of this site, and have weathered far less than the bulk of the soils. These features are known as sea stacks, and they appear standing out of the water or on the beach as though as sculptures placed decoratively along the shoreline. Occasionally these stacks appear as adornments on the marine terrace, indicating their ancient origin on the sea floor prior to uplift. These rock formations are composed of sandstone with layers of quartz. Coastal prairie in the Sonoma Coast State Park north of Jenner The active San Andreas Fault runs roughly parallel and near to the coastline of Sonoma Coast State Park. Soils within the site are classified as coastal beach sands (where rocky shoreline is not evident) and marine escarpment group soils on the marine terrace; typically soils above the marine terrace are in the Rohnerville loam group.Soil Survey, Sonoma County, California, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Government Printing Office, Washington DC, May 1972 Most of the beach sands consist of a medium coarse brown to gray sandy materials, reflecting the high rate of erosion of escarpment soils into the ocean; however, there are patches of smooth pebble beach such as the approximately one hundred meter stretch lying immediately north of Goat Rock. Ecology The habitats include marine, littoral and coastal prairie. In the marine environment are found gray whales, harbor seals and California sea lions as well as a multitude of fish species and other marine organisms. There are also modest kelp beds and other marine vegetation. The littoral beach environment has fewer organisms than more southerly zones, because of the colder temperatures; however, there are tidepools which are abundant with marine flora and fauna. Russian River State Marine Reserve and Russian River State Marine Conservation Area and Bodega Head State Marine Reserve & Bodega Head State Marine Conservation Area protect area resources. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean and freshwater wildlife and marine ecosystems. The coastal prairie soils are moderately well drained and granular in nature with moderate soil permeability; these features lead to slight erosion potential and moderately high bio-productivity. Acidity of these loamy soils is medium to high, and thus some vegetative stunting and hospitality to rare plants is offered. The upland environment on the coastal prairie offers a variety of grasses and wildflowers including varieties of lupine, thistle and wild oats. The typical annual plant productivity is approximately per acre (3700 kg/ha) of air-dried yield per annum in an abundant moisture year, and about half that amount in a very dry year. A variety of birds and mammals thrive on the coastal prairie including numerous California Mule Deer, Odocoileus hemionus californicus. History Some of the oldest natural history of this area related to mammals are a rock formation about one mile (1.6 km) south of the Russian River. There is found a sea stack formation with prominent rubbing marks about two to four meters in elevation, a height too high to have been caused by modern bovids. Mammoths are believed to have roamed here as recently as 40,000 years ago, and they are thought to have created these severe rubbing marks.E. Breck Parkman, Mammoth Rocks: Part 1, Where Pleistocene Giants got Good Rub, Center for the Study of the First Americans, Mammoths Series, Volume 18, Number 1, December 2002 Mammoth fossil remains have been found at Bodega Head at the south end of Sonoma Coast State Park. Earliest known human settlement of this site was by the Native American Coast Miwok and Pomo tribes. As early as 1849 archaeological finds were recorded on this property, and to date dozens of prehistorical kitchen middens and other types of tribal habitation finds have been made. The property is part of the Mexican land grant Rancho Bodega. The Russians are thought to have begun logging the old- growth forests directly above the coastal prairie in the early 19th century. Duncans Point in 2009 The underwater delineation of the property is considered to extend to from the shoreline. While no shipwrecks have been discovered, the literature indicates that there are 17 vessels which may have been lost in these waters. There are remains of numerous historic barns and other agricultural buildings on the coastal prairie indicating 19th century settlement by Europeans; at Duncans Point there are iron pins embedded in the sandstone bluffs as evidence of the active shipping industry here in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

His credits include the Juno Award winning album Love at the End of the World by Sam Roberts and albums by The High Dials, and The Dears. He is currently guitarist with the Montreal band Receivers, an offshoot of his now defunct band Marlowe (1996‚Äì2005). Early career In 1996 songwriters Joseph Donovan and Alex Olsen's careers came to fruition upon forming the band Marlowe. Marlowe consisted of Donovan on Guitar, Olsen on vocals and keyboard, Jason Thomas, George Donoso and Eric Fares. The band received positive reviews and support but ultimately struggled through member changes and lack of album support. This forced Donovan and Olsen to chart their own course and caused the development of Donovan's music production career with Stock Market Audio, co- owned by Adrian Popovich. In addition to his studio work, Donovan also took time as The Dears' tour manager and guitarist. Recent career In addition to his production company, Donovan continues his music career with the band Receivers. The Receivers have shared the stage with Sam Roberts Band, Beach House, The Clientele, The Black Heart Procession, Fleet Foxes, and They Are Nocturnal. Donovan now works out of Mountain City Studios (co-owned by Popovich) and continues to produce award-winning acts, most recently the Sam Roberts Band, whose gold certified album Love at the End of the World garnered national success and won Donovan a Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year.

The role was originated by Joan Van Ark on April 6, 2004, who portrayed the role until 2005, with Judith Chapman assuming the role on January 17, 2005. She is the mother of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). She is known for attracting troublesome men, and being quite troublesome herself. Gloria can be naive at times, always taking things to the extreme. Known for her over-the-top personality, she owned and operated Gloworm, the hottest Genoa City club, until it burned down. Casting  In March 2004, it was reported that former Knots Landing star Joan Van Ark would join The Young and the Restless as Gloria Fisher, mother of Michael Baldwin and Kevin Fisher. CBS reportedly wanted a \\"big name\\" star to tackle the role of Gloria. Van Ark debuted on April 6, 2004. By December, news broke that Van Ark had decided to leave The Young and the Restless because she was unaccustomed to the rigors of daytime television, including the long work days and the fast turnaround on scripts and production. Within weeks, the role was recast with Judith Chapman; Van Ark was last seen on January 7, 2005, and Chapman assumed the role on January 17, 2005. In March 2011, it was announced that Chapman had been taken off her contract and bumped to a recurring status. In October 2014, it was announced that Chapman would appear as Gloria on the soap opera's sister series, The Bold and the Beautiful, with her scenes airing the following month. In September 2015, Chapman stated on her Facebook page that she had \\"no idea\\" whether or not she would ever be asked back to The Young and the Restless, writing that she personally believed she would never return. In November 2016, however, upon the installation of Sally Sussman as co-executive producer and head writer, Chapman was announced to be returning to The Young and the Restless the following month for an unspecified amount of time. Upon her return, the actress stated: \\"This is all such a nice surprise. I had truly made peace with the idea that I would never be called back to the show.\\" She last appeared on October 1, 2018.. In September 2020, it was announced that Judith Chapman will reprise the role of Gloria Bardwell, starting appearing again on the show from October 2020 .  Development  Gloria is known for her larger-than-life personality. According to Chapman, \\"She makes gallons of lemonade when the world gives her lemons!\\" Chapman also admires Gloria's resilience: \\"Somehow she just keeps finding the bright things. She gets very depressed of course, but the universe keeps throwing her a bone. I love that about her; that she's willing to pick herself up by the boot straps. Even though her intentions and her judgments are often times misguided. Gloria is not a malicious person, but she will certainly take every opportunity to improve her lot in life!\\" On October 21, 2014, Michael Logan from TV Guide reported that Chapman would cross over to The Young and the Restless' sister soap The Bold and the Beautiful on November 20. Gloria will attend a Forrester fashion show, where she makes \\"a beeline\\" for Eric Forrester (John McCook), whom she previously met at Victor (Eric Braeden) and Nikki Newman's (Melody Thomas Scott) wedding in 2013. A show spokesperson commented, \\"expect some business talk and a little flirting.\\" Storylines =Backstory= In the 1960s, Gloria Simmons was a naive 16-year-old girl living in Detroit, Michigan. She met the charming River Baldwin (Michael Gross) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and he dropped out of college to live in a hippie commune with Gloria. Then, Gloria got pregnant, and she gave birth to their son, Michael Baldwin (now played by Christian LeBlanc). River and Gloria became Vietnam War protesters, and River was accused of a bomb conspiracy that killed a janitor. In reality, River tried to stop the bomb threat, but he was forced to flee to Canada in order to protect Gloria and Michael. Thus, Gloria was left alone to raise her son for 10 years. In the 1970s, Gloria still lived in Detroit with Michael, and she worked as a waitress at a diner. There, she met Tom Fisher. Gloria and Tom got married, and their son, Kevin Fisher, was born. Terrible Tom, as he soon became known, was an alcoholic who often took out his anger on the boys. When Michael was a teenager, he left home to escape Tom's wrath. Gloria was too afraid to stop her husband, and Kevin was often beaten and locked in closets by his father. When Kevin was old enough, he ran away from Tom, and he moved in with Michael. Both brothers ended up in Genoa City; Michael became a prominent lawyer, but both boys got into their fair share of troubles. Eventually, Kevin fled Genoa City, and he found Gloria in Detroit, living in the same apartment as before. Kevin's criminal activity followed him there, and Gloria accompanied him back to Genoa City when he was found with her. Reluctantly, Michael agreed to let Kevin and Gloria live with him. =2004‚Äì2018= Gloria arrived in Genoa City in April 2004. Soon Gloria enchanted the much older owner of Jabot Cosmetics, John Abbott, Sr. Gloria and John went on a cruise together, and they returned as a married couple. John's children, Ashley and Jack Abbott, disapproved of their new stepmother. The following year, Tom arrived in Genoa City. While investigating, Michael found out that Gloria never officially divorced Tom as Gloria believed he had died, invalidating her marriage to John. Tom blackmailed Gloria into stealing money from John, while she led him to believe that she was using the money for Michael's wedding to Lauren Fenmore. Tom and Gloria legally ended their marriage and she and John remarried in an official ceremony. Gloria went along with Tom's lie in order to prevent herself from being outed by him to John. Tom teamed up with an old accomplice, Sheila Carter, to take down Michael and Lauren on their wedding day. Eventually, John gunned down Tom in an alley after Tom and Sheila took Lauren hostage. During a struggle, Tom was killed and John later got into a car accident, where he lost his memory. Though Ashley falsely confessed, John soon remembered what he had done and after confessing, was sentenced to seven years in prison for killing Tom. While John was incarcerated, Gloria, hoping to endear herself to her stepchildren, obtained a sample of \\"GloAgain,\\" Jabot's latest skincare product, from Ashley. She tainted it, planning on catching the \\"mishap\\" just in time, before the product went out to the market, hoping she'd look like the hero. Unbeknownst to Gloria, however, Jack sent the samples of product out early to select Jabot customers, and a woman died from using the tainted skin cream. Katherine Chancellor, who was running Jabot in John's absence, blamed Jack for the tragedy, firing him from the company. Gloria became friends with Katherine and John's ex-wife, Jill Abbott. She moved Kevin into the Abbott Mansion, and both she and Kevin got jobs at Jabot. While John was in prison, Jack, Ashley, and Gloria found out that he was being over-medicated. While his father was not in his right mind, Jack convinced him to write a letter that wrote Gloria out of his will. Six months after his incarceration, John was due to be pardoned by the governor. Before he was released, he suffered a massive stroke, and he was left in a vegetative state. Before his health decline, John signed a DNR, and he died with his family and friends surrounding him in 2006. Jack, still resentful over the circumstances that led to his father's incarceration, intentionally lied to Gloria about the time of the service, causing her to miss John's funeral. When Gloria, Michael, Kevin, and Lauren arrived and discovered that they'd missed the funeral, they held their own memorial, where Gloria eulogized John. Jack and Ashley were stunned to discover that Gloria received 50% of their father's fortune through his will. A prison chaplain came forward, and he gave a judge John's handwritten letter that wrote Gloria out of the will. Appalled, Gloria did not receive any of John's fortune through his final modification and she discovered that her divorce from Tom was never finalized, yet again invalidating their second marriage. Jack kicked Gloria and Kevin out of the Abbott Mansion and they were forced to move in with Michael and Lauren. Still, Gloria wasted no time moving on. She romanced district attorney William Bardwell, who recently inherited a fortune from his uncle's death. William was also recently widowed and he and Gloria met at a grief counseling session. Jill Abbott also pursued William, but Gloria schemed in order to win his heart. She then discovered that William was investigating the Jabot skin cream scandal and she quickly married him to throw him off in 2007. William soon admitted that he didn't receive his inheritance yet due to legality issues. When William discovered that Gloria tainted the skin cream, he loved her too much to turn her in. The stress of his decision affected his health. Suddenly, he had a stroke and Gloria went to turn herself in. William stopped her from throwing her life away but his condition worsened and he later died in 2007. After his death, Gloria received a letter that William's inheritance was finalized and she received $50 million. The truth about John's \\"modification\\" to his own will was revealed, and the judge's previous decision was overruled. Gloria received half of John's billion dollar fortune and she quickly went from rags to riches in no time at all. She threw an extravagant memorial service for William at the Genoa City Athletic Club, and William's twin brother, Jeffrey Bardwell (also played by Ted Shackelford), arrived for the service. Jeffrey came to Genoa City, intent on getting his brother's money. When he discovered Gloria's secret about the skin cream scandal, he blackmailed her into marrying him. Gloria and Jeffrey moved back into the Abbott Mansion, but Jack and his then-wife, Sharon Abbott (Sharon Case), were also living there. The two couples shared the mansion but both intended on keeping it for themselves. With Jeffrey's help, Jack hired Alistair Wallingford (Jerry Douglas) to haunt Gloria due to his uncanny resemblance to John Abbott. In the end, Jack felt guilty and he and Sharon moved out of the mansion. Gloria felt guilty and she gave the mansion back to Jack. Gloria and Jeffrey moved into the Abbott pool house. While there, they admitted their feelings for each other and they made love. Suddenly, Jeffrey filed for divorce, including half of Gloria's net worth, because they couldn't agree on her finances. Meanwhile, Gloria decided to donate half of her net worth to the Marksalogria Charitable Foundation. \\"Marksalogria\\" was an anagram for \\"Gloria's Karma.\\" When she and Jeffrey were divorced in 2008, he received the other half of her fortune. Gloria was then left without a penny to her name. Gloria tried to find a stable job, but when Jeffrey saw how his ex-wife was living, he reconciled with her. Jeffrey also felt guilty about stealing Gloria's diamonds before their divorce. Jill Abbott wanted Jeffrey, but when he chose Gloria, she made Gloria her slave at Jabot, where Gloria was a receptionist. Jeffrey and Gloria eloped in Las Vegas, Nevada with Little Richard officiating the ceremony in 2008. Upon their return, Jill fired Gloria from Jabot. Kevin and his fianc√©e, Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), decided to get married at an ashram in Malibu, California. In a turn of events, the guru who officiated the ceremony was Michael's father, Lowell Baldwin. While living on the run, Lowell changed his name to River Baldwin. Michael investigated his father in the past and he knew that he was a wanted criminal. Still, he and Gloria vowed not to turn him in. When River came to Genoa City to apologize, Gloria and Michael forgave him but Jeffrey turned him in to the FBI out of jealousy. Michael worked to clear his father's name but Gloria's damage from the past was coming back to haunt her. She pretended to be someone else and she called Lowell the \\"ringleader\\" of their activist group. When Michael found out that Gloria incriminated Lowell, she confessed and she apologized to Lowell, stating that she was only trying to protect baby Michael. Gloria testified for Lowell, against Jeffrey's wishes. Lowell was then released from prison, which infuriated Jeffrey. Shortly after, Gloria and Jeffrey wanted to take over Jabot. She conned Katherine Chancellor into giving her shares of Jabot stock in her will. Gloria and Jeffrey set up a company called Agreeing Lovers, to buy more shares. Agreeing Lovers was an anagram for \\"Gloria's Revenge.\\" The four Abbott children united with Gloria and when Katherine Chancellor suddenly died, Gloria and the Abbotts once again had controlling interest in Jabot. Jeffrey was still angry that Gloria testified for River and he burned himself with the tainted skin cream in order to incriminate Gloria. She was sent to jail and she met Marge Cotrooke, Katherine's doppelganger. Marge was really Katherine and she tried to convince Gloria about her true identity had actually died. Katherine was in jail and everyone thought that she was Marge. Kevin discovered the truth and soon everyone found out that Katherine was really alive. Everyone began to focus on Gloria's shares of Jabot. Jeffrey visited Gloria in jail to tell her that he wanted a divorce. In the end, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) bought Gloria's shares and he transferred her payment into an offshore account. Michael cleared Gloria's name when he proved that the woman who supposedly died from the skin cream had a previous medical condition. Gloria was released from jail and she found Jeffrey in bed with Jill. She signed off on their divorce papers and she never wanted to see him again. To make matters worse, River left town when Michael discovered that he stole millions of dollars from a bank located near the bombing in the 1960s, and Kevin was admitted to a mental institution. Still, Gloria was not off the hook. She was sued in a civil suit against Jabot for the financial damage of her skin cream tainting. Jabot received a large sum of money in the settlement and Jeffrey revealed that he only divorced Gloria to protect her assets. Katherine and Jill joined forces with Gloria and Jeffrey against Victor Newman. When Gloria and Jill discovered that the bank holding the money from the sale of the Jabot stock had gone under, they rushed to the bank to get their money. Victor sped up the demolition process, and Gloria, Jill, and Jeffrey were trapped inside. Fortunately, Jack rescued them in time, but Gloria and Jeffrey came home without a penny to their name. They moved out of the Genoa City Athletic Club into Phyllis Newman's (Michelle Stafford) penthouse apartment suite. Gloria and Jeffrey wanted Victor to pay them back for stealing their money and they exploited Colleen Carlton (Tammin Sursok) as part of Victor's dirty work. Gloria and Jeffrey used Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) to further sabotage Victor. They took Patty hostage in order to receive a ransom payment from Victor and Jack Abbott. In the end, Gloria and Jeffrey opened two suitcases that they believed had millions of dollars inside, but instead, blue dye exploded in their faces. Intent on giving up her life of trickery, Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) offered Gloria $5 million if she retrieved an original Terroni painting for him. He used Gloria because \\"Terrible Tom\\" stole the original painting and it was in his safety deposit box. In the end, Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei) returned the painting to the museum. Gloria's luck finally turned around when Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) exposed Victor Newman in his magazine, Restless Style, regarding the death of his niece, Colleen Carlton. The SEC discovered Victor's involvement in the destruction of the bank that held Gloria's money. She and Jeffrey were then repaid the money that they made from the sale of their Jabot stocks and the Bardwells were rolling in the dough once again. Gloria then teamed up with Jack to maintain control of Jabot but Victor Newman bought the company from them. He hired Gloria as Jabot Ambassadress to spite Jack. Phyllis kicked Gloria and Jeffrey out of her penthouse apartment and Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John) decided to sell his nightclub Indigo to Jeffrey. He gave the club to Gloria as an anniversary gift, even though they were still divorced. Gloria renamed the club Gloworm, and she held its grand opening in 2010 with Jeffrey as her date. Soon after, Gloria found out that Jeffrey was laundering money out of Gloworm to run his own gambling operation. Gloria forced Jeffrey to work to pay back Gloworm, but she forgave him. She bought him the title of Count for Valentine's Day in 2010. Gloria became upset when Kevin's ex-wife, Jana, began stalking her son. She teamed up with Kevin's friend, Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson), and they broke into Jana's apartment. They were arrested for trespassing, but the charges were soon dropped. In addition, Gloria became a real estate agent and she sold her first house to her former stepson, Billy Abbott, and his new wife, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle). Still, Jeffrey was stressed because he had no way to pay back the people involved in his gambling business. Eventually, mobster Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr) began to threaten Jeffrey. Soon after, Jeffrey scrounged up enough money to pay the mob by draining Gloworm's bank account. He left Gloria for Las Vegas, Nevada in 2011. With no money to run her beloved club, Gloria began to romance Angelo to keep her business afloat. He gave Gloria money in exchange for becoming a business partner for Gloworm. Angelo's daughter, Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo), began to pursue Kevin, but he was engaged to Chloe Mitchell. In 2012, Kevin left Chloe at the altar when he was tricked by Angelina. While \\"on the run,\\" Angelo hired one of his henchmen to kill Kevin, and Gloria believed that he was leading the search to find him. Kevin and Angelina returned to Genoa City as a married couple, and at the same time, Jeffrey returned from \\"Las Vegas.\\" He had amnesia and he could not remember who Gloria was. Gloria was furious with Jeffrey for stealing all of her money and she ran into Angelo's arms, having no idea that he almost murdered Kevin. However, Jeffrey later regains his memory but is later bound and gagged in an alley outside of Gloworm no thanks to Angelo, who intends to run off and marry Gloria. With some help from Jill, Jeffrey is freed and goes on to crash Angelo and Gloria's wedding, explaining to her that not only did Angelo kidnap him but that he was the one who stole her money. Jeffrey and Gloria married; however, during the wedding, Chelsea Lawson stormed into the room and announced Jeffrey as her father. Jeffrey denied it as Anita snuck out. On December 21, 2016, after over a year offscreen, Gloria returned to celebrate Christmas with her family. It didn't take long for Gloria to lash out at Chloe for dating her son Kevin again. She also offended Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) as she tried to defend her daughter. Michael and Kevin try to keep her in check. Gloria reveals that she has once again left Jeffrey and never wants to hear his name again. It is revealed that Jeffrey spent all of Gloria's money and she is now broke. As a result of this, Gloria asks Lauren for a job at Fenmores, which is struggling. After Lauren refuses, Gloria betrays her by telling Jack that she'll help him gain control of Fenmores, with the stipulation that she gains a \\"small role\\" in running the company. She then tricks multiple investors into not investing in Fenmores so that Jack will be Lauren's only option. Jack ends up acquiring 49% of Fenmores. Gloria then goes to Jack to cash in the job promise, but is turned away and told she cannot and will not be offered a position. Gloria and Jack later end up drinking together, eventually sleeping together. Gloria attempts to disguise this incident as sexual assault on gossip show GC Buzz and tries using it to blackmail Jack into giving her some sort of compensation. Jack ends up giving Gloria a job as his executive assistant, which Gloria accepts reluctantly, as she had hoped for a more important job title. Jack and Gloria soon become friends with benefits but Jack calls it off after it begins to interfere with their working relationship and his personal life. Jack and Gloria still remain friends and often get involved in each other's personal business. Gloria continues to work as Jabots executive assistant when former son in-law Billy Abbott becomes CEO. However Gloria is replaced by newcomer Ted when Ashley Abbott takes over in mid October.

From 1946 through 1954, he was First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR. He was born to a poor peasant family in a small village in Borisov County (okrug), which in 1924 was incorporated as one of the nine rural areas in the Sherbakulsky District of the Omsk Oblast. In 1915, he went to the two-year Kazakh-Russian school in what is now the Poltava Raion, graduating in 1917. He attended the Narimanov Institute in Moscow, but did not complete his first year. In 1919, he got a job as a school teacher in a rural school, but the school closed due to the civil war and he returned to his home. From 1919 to 1926, Shayakhmetov was the secretary of the Turkoman Rural District executive committee of the GPU. By 1923, he was already a first-rate agent, solving crimes in the Cherlaksky District, Omsk Oblast. From 1926 to 1928, Shayakhmetov taught office management (official documentation) as the political instructor in a rural organization called \\"Koschi\\" in the Petropavl Okrug. From 1928 to 1938, he worked for the NKVD, first as Deputy Department Chief for the North Kazakhstan Oblast, then as the Deputy Department Chief for the Alma Ata Oblast. From 1938 to 1946, Shayakhmetov worked his way up from Third Secretary to First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR. He was the first ethnic Kazakh to hold that post.Zardykhan, Zharmukhamed (2004) \\"Russians in Kazakhstan and demographic change: imperial legacy and the Kazakh way of nation building\\" Asian Ethnicity 5(1): pp. 61‚Äì79, p. 65 In March 1954, Shayakhmetov was replaced as First Secretary by Panteleimon Kondratyevich Ponomarenko, a Russian, as part of Khrushchev's post-Stalin reorganization. For about a year, well into 1955, he was the First Secretary of the South Kazakhstan provincial committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, before he was removed from that post as well. He served as Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities (1950‚Äì1954).

Wild Pumpkins at Midnight and Europe In 1993 Nick Larkins re-joined Wild Pumpkins at Midnight and moved to The Netherlands. Until the end of 1998 Wild Pumpkins were based in the Netherlands, returning to Australia for brief periods, touring and releasing 6 CDs in Australia, Europe and Brazil. Roughly half their recorded output was produced with award winning studio engineer Tony Cohen. (Birthday Party, Nick Cave, The Beasts of Bourbon, The Cruel Sea, Hunters & Collectors). WPAM albums and concerts featured guest appearances by other influential Australian musicians including Chris Wilson, members of Weddings Parties Anything, Joe Geia and Tiddas. Larkins and other members of WPAM performed with Aboriginal songwriter Joe Geia on and off for years. In 1995 Larkins and Dan Tuffy from WPAM toured Europe with Geia for several months during a break in WPAM commitments. On that tour they performed live on German radio station WDR to a Friday night drive-time audience of over 3 million listeners. With Wild Pumpkins Nick performed at the prestigious Montreaux Jazz Festival (Switzerland); shared billing with Santana, Bj√∂rk, Nick Cave, Dirty Three, Tricky, Rage Against the Machine, Porno 4 Pyros, Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones), David Crosby (Crosby, Stills & Nash), Link Wray and others. They toured extensively in former Eastern Bloc countries, including the Former Yugoslavia in 1994 during the war, and also played festivals and clubs all over Europe. Larkins also lived and performed in Czech Republic in 1997. Return to Melbourne Wild Pumpkins At Midnight ended as a band at the close of the 1998 European tour. In 1999 and 2000 Larkins performed with Native American, Tibetan and Australian Aboriginal musicians on a project called 'Stories And Songs'. An album was released in 2000 and two documentary films, shown on the ABC television show Message Stick, and at the various film festivals. Since 2000 Larkins has appeared on Australian television series The Secret Life of Us, the 2006 Melbourne Music documentary Sticky Carpet, and the Australian surf music documentary/album 'Delightful Rain'. Larkins lived in Barcelona, Spain, in 2004, performing solo, and also in the UK. He returned to Melbourne at the end of that year and from early 2005 began performing with his own band 'Nick Larkins and The Bones'. From early 2005 Nick also played hammond organ and guitar for Cruel Sea guitarist Dan Rumour, in the Dan Rumour Band. The instrumental combo changed its name to Dan Rumour & The Drift in 2007 with the release of their first, self-titled, album. Dan Rumour & The Drift also included Cruel Sea drummer Jim Elliot and fellow ex-WPAM member Michael Turner on bass guitar. Larkins and Rumour co-produced and mixed the band's first album. From late 2010 until 2016 Larkins performed with fellow Tasmanian musician Monique Brumby as a guitarist, bass player, and engineer on her self titled album released in 2014. In 2011 Larkins began working as a songwriter- producer with Melbourne musician Catherine Sheahan on a project called 'twentyfive'. twentyfive aimed to write, record and release a new song every two weeks, with twenty five different singers primarily from the Melbourne independent band scene. Their studio was located in a restored 1957 train carriage called the Hobsons Bay, in Melbourne's historic Newport Rail Workshop, where the train was originally built. The site is also the home of Melbourne's Railway Museum operated by the Australian Railway Historical Society. The project ran out of funding before it was complete, but it was filmed by documentary crew F-Reel and director Fiona Cochrane. The documentary film was released in 2016 and toured international film festivals, picking up several awards.http://www.f-reel.com/25_Tracks.html From 2005 Larkins played as a guest musician on Hammond Organ for Indigenous lead Melbourne band The Grenadines, appearing on their first album 'Story of Woe'. In 2008 he became their bass player and in 2011 the band changed their name to The Deans, focusing on a modern soul sound, and released a self titled album in 2012 recorded and produced by Larkins. In 2014 the band released a second self titled album, also recorded and produced by Larkins, for which they won The Age/Music Victoria Best Indigenous Act award 2014. The Deans continue to perform regularly at festivals and clubs with Larkins on bass and producing their releases.https://www.thedeansofsoul.com In 2016 Larkins joined blues band Hurricane Hearn on electric guitar. Also in 2016 Larkins formed an improvised instrumental soundtrack band with electric violin and mandolin player Jodi Moore from Dirty Lucy and Nick Larkins & The Bones. Larkins plays theremin, bass VI and electric guitars in the band. In 2017 EchoZilla released their first 3 albums as 24 instrumental tracks available on Youtube. Live and studio engineer Wild Pumpkins At Midnight co-produced their own recordings, even when working with experienced producers like Tony Cohen. Often the whole band would be involved in mixing a song, with three or four people working the mixing desk at the same time. Each member of the band learnt recording skills and techniques in this way. Larkins began mixing live sound for friends' bands in Melbourne around 1999 and has since worked as a live and studio engineer for many acts and projects. These include: Dan Rumour and The Drift, Dandelion Wine, Duckdive, Wons P Phreeley, Even, Catnip, Renee Geyer (studio assistant), Paul Kelly, Chris Wilson, Lunars, The Winter Migration, Autumn Gray, Man Bites God, James Hazelden, I Dream in Transit, Slow Human Escape, The Triangles, Digger and The Pussycats, Immigrant Union, Brillig, The Shambelles, Stories and Songs of The People, Joe Geia, Big Low (Netherlands), Monique Brumby, twentyfive.

His relationship to Judah ibn Verga cannot be determined; it is certain, however, that he was not the son of the latter, for he never refers to Judah as his father. Schudt (1718)J√ºdische Merkw√ºrdigkeiten, i. 131. was apparently misled by the title of the Shebe·π≠ Yehudah when he called its author \\"Solomon ben Schefet.\\" Shevet Yehudah Ibn Verga himself says that he was sent by the Spanish communities to collect money for the ransom of the prisoners of M√°laga (Shebe·π≠ Yehudah, ¬ß 64.), but he lived also at Lisbon as a marrano, and was an eyewitness of the massacre there in 1506 (ibid ¬ß 60). Later he escaped to Turkey, probably to Adrianople, where he wrote the Shebe·π≠ Yehudah (Shevet Yehudah) an account of the persecutions of the Jews in different countries and epochs. In a short preface he says that he found an account of some persecutions at the end of a work of Judah ibn Verga, which he copied; to this he added a narration of the persecutions of his own time, the compilation being afterward completed and edited by his son, Joseph ibn Verga. The title \\"Shebe·π≠ Yehudah\\", which is an allusion to Judah ibn Verga (\\"shebe·π≠\\" in Hebrew being the equivalent of the Spanish \\"verga\\", \\"staff\\"), refers to Gen. 49:10. The work contains an account of 64 persecutions, besides narratives of many disputations and an account of Jewish customs in different countries. Ibn Verga endeavored to solve the problem why the Jews, particularly the Spanish Jews, suffered from persecutions more than any other people. He gives various reasons, among them being the superiority of the Jews (\\"whom the Lord loves He chastens\\": Proverbs 3:12), and chiefly their separation from the Christians in matters of food; their troubles were also a punishment for their sins. In general, Ibn Verga does not endeavor to conceal the faults of the Jews; he sometimes even exaggerates them. As this work is the compilation of three authors, it is not arranged in chronological order. There is no connection between the narratives, but the Hebrew style is clear. Ibn Verga knew Latin, and derived many narratives from Latin sources. This work contains also a treatise on the form of the Temple of Solomon. Leopold Zunz (1840)Notes on the Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, ed. Asher, ii. 268. points out the importance of the work from the geographical point of view, as it contains a considerable number of names of places, as well as a description of customs. =Printed editions and translations= The Shebe·π≠ Yehudah was first printed in Turkey c. 1550; since then it has been reprinted several times. It has been four times translated into Jud√¶o-German, first at Cracow, 1591. It has been translated into Spanish by Meir de Leon, Amsterdam, 1640; into Latin by Gentius, Amsterdam 1651; Hebrew printing by Bunfat Schneur and co-partners in F√ºrth, 1724; into German by M. Wiener, Hanover, 1856, Leipzig 1858. Fragments of it have been translated by Eisenmenger,Das Entdecte Judenthum, ii. Schudt,J√ºdische Merk-w√ºrdigkeiten, i. Menahem Man ha-Levi,She'erit Yisrael and Joseph Zedner.Auswahl, pp. 96 et seq. At the end of paragraph 64 Ibn Verga says that he wrote a work entitled Shebe·π≠ 'Ebrato, containing persecution narratives and some rabbinical treatises, now lost. =Influence= The historical value of the data contained in the Shebe·π≠ Yehudah has been seriously questioned by Isidore Loeb (1892).\\"Le folk-lore juif dans la chronique du Schebet Iehuda d'Ibn Verga\\", REJ 24 (1892),Revue des √©tudes juives 24.1 et seq. Loeb holds that, though an original writer, Ibn Verga is not always trustworthy, and that some of his material belongs really in the domain of legend. Ibn Verga was especially interested in the religious controversies held between Jews and Christians; and the fullest account of these controversies is given in his work. But even these seem to be fictitious‚Äîwith the exception, perhaps, of that of the one at Tortosa (¬ß 40). The Shebe·π≠ Yehudah is valuable, however, for the Jewish folk-lore and the popular traditions which it contains. The only one of Verga's contemporaries that made use of his work seems to be Samuel Usque, in his Consola√ß√£o.REJ xvii. 270. The Latin translation of Gentius contains two peculiar mistakes on the title-page: the word is written, and is translated \\"tribe\\" instead of \\"rod\\". A Yiddish translation, with additions (Shebe·π≠ Yehudah ha-Shalem), was published in Wilna, 1900. Corrections to the text of M. Wiener are given by Loeb in Revue des √©tudes juives 17 p87.

It ran from 1909 until 1948 and its route included the famous and arduous Rimutaka Incline.  Introduction  From the 1897 completion of the Wairarapa Line until 1908, the route through the Wairarapa was NZR's primary means of accessing Wellington as the western line through the Kapiti Coast and Horowhenua was privately owned by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company. The Napier Express passenger train operated from Napier to Wellington via the Wairarapa, but on 7 December 1908, the Wellington and Manawatu Railway was purchased, and in early 1909, the Napier Express was diverted to the quicker western route. Accordingly, the Wairarapa Mail was introduced to provide Wairarapa residents with connections to Wellington, Manawatu, and the Hawkes Bay.  Operation  After the WMR was acquired, most of NZR's long-distance trains used the WMR's Thorndon station as their Wellington terminus. The Wairarapa Mail was the only long-distance train to run out of NZR's Lambton Quay station, which primarily served commuter traffic from the Hutt Valley. Between the Hutt Valley and the Wairarapa, the train had to travel over the Rimutaka Incline over the Rimutaka Range, and at its terminus in Woodville, its carriages were attached to a slow mixed train from Dannevirke that continued through the Manawatu Gorge to terminate in Palmerston North. Passengers could also connect with the northbound Napier Express in Woodville. The Wairarapa Mail was hauled by a diverse range of motive power. Until World War II, WW class steam locomotives were typical motive power between Wellington and Summit at the western end of the Rimutaka Incline, while H class Fell engines handled the train over the Incline, and from Cross Creek at the eastern end through to Woodville, A class locomotives were normal. Passenger carriages were often older wooden mainline carriages displaced from premier services by new rolling stock; some of these carriages were gas-lit into the 1930s and even later. Dramatic changes took place in the later half of the 1930s. In 1936, railcars of the RM class Wairarapa type were introduced on the Wellington to Woodville route, and their ability to run over the Rimutaka Incline at speed allowed a quicker timetable. The railcars became quite popular, but the Mail continued to run daily, and in 1937, the Wellington railway station was opened, replacing the Thorndon and Lambton Quay termini and allowing the Mail to operate from the same station as the other mainline expresses. The timetable in 1939 allowed for a 7:50 am departure from Wellington for the northbound service, reaching Masterton at 11:17 am and Woodville at 1:22 pm before progressing on as part of a mixed train to Palmerston North, arriving at 2:53 pm. The southbound service left Woodville at 12:13 pm after the arrival of a mixed that had left Palmerston North at 11:04 am, and it passed through Masterton at 1:59 pm before terminating in Wellington at 5:44 pm. Allowances were made for refreshment stops in Masterton and Woodville as the Mail was never fitted with dining cars.  Demise  The Wairarapa Mails demise was primarily due to the introduction of the railcars and would have likely come about sooner were it not for the traffic boom associated with World War II. After the war, AB class locomotives were introduced in both the Hutt Valley and Wairarapa and this modernised the train, but coal shortages in 1944 had led to the service's reduction to running thrice weekly. From this point, the railcars came to be dominant and they fully replaced the Mail in 1948.  After the Wairarapa Mail  Despite the Mails demise, carriage trains were sometimes operated to cater for demand at holiday times, as the railcars could not run in multiple and there were only six of them. In 1955, the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened, eliminating the Incline, and by December 1963, peak hour passenger demand exceeded the capacity of the 88 seater railcars that had taken over from the Wairarapa railcars. Accordingly, a permanent carriage train was re-introduced, from 16 December 1963, to the Wairarapa; this service was the forerunner to the still- operational Wairarapa Connection. An additional morning peak service was added in 1971, still using an 88-seat railcar. This service was in turn, replaced by a passenger train in 1976. As the 88 seat railcars wore out, they were rebuilt as AC class carriages. These were used on the still running Wellington- Masterton-Palmerston North service from 1978 until 1982, when they, in turn, were replaced with ordinary carriages. The service, which was the last vestige of the Wairarapa Mail, ceased running in 1988.

Magicians are common figures in works of fantasy, such as fantasy literature and role-playing games, and enjoy a rich history in mythology, legends, fiction, and folklore. Character archetypes The Enchanter Merlin, by Howard Pyle, from The Story of King Arthur and His Knights (1903) In medieval chivalric romance, the wizard often appears as a wise old man and acts as a mentor, with Merlin from the King Arthur stories being a prime example. Wizards such as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and Albus Dumbledore from Harry Potter are also featured as mentors, and Merlin remains prominent as both an educative force and mentor in modern works of Arthuriana. Other magicians, such as Saruman from The Lord of the Rings or Lord Voldemort from Harry Potter, can appear as hostile villains. Villainous sorcerers were so crucial to pulp fantasy that the genre in which they appeared was dubbed sword and sorcery. Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea explored the question of how wizards learned their art, introducing to modern fantasy the role of the wizard as protagonist. This theme has been further developed in modern fantasy, often leading to wizards as heroes on their own quests. Such heroes may have their own mentor, a wizard as well. Wizards can be cast similarly to the absent-minded professor: being foolish and prone to misconjuring. They can also be capable of great magic, both good or evil. Even comical wizards are often capable of great feats, such as those of Miracle Max in The Princess Bride; although he is a washed-up wizard fired by the villain, he saves the dying hero. =Appearance= Wizards are often depicted as old, white-haired, and with long white beards majestic enough to occasionally host lurking woodland creatures. This depiction predates the modern fantasy genre, being derived from the traditional image of wizards such as Merlin. A famous magician who noticeably entered popular culture is Yen Sid from the Walt Disney Pictures film Fantasia. In the Dragonlance campaign setting of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, wizards show their moral alignment by their robes. Terry Pratchett described robes as a magician's way of establishing to those they meet that they are capable of practicing magic. =Limits= To introduce conflict, writers of fantasy fiction often place limits on the magical abilities of wizards to prevent them from solving problems too easily. In Larry Niven's The Magic Goes Away, once an area's mana is exhausted, no one can use magic. A common limit invented by Jack Vance in his The Dying Earth series, and later popularized in role-playing games is that a wizard can only cast a specific number of spells in a day. Magic can also require various sacrifices or the use of certain materials, such as gemstones, blood, or a live sacrifice. Even if the magician lacks scruples, obtaining the material may be difficult. A. K. Moonfire combines these limits in his book The Aubrey Stalking Portal. The magician expends power to fuel his spells, but does not replenish that power naturally; therefore, he must make sacrifices to generate more magical power. The extent of a wizard's knowledge is limited to which spells a wizard knows and can cast. Magic may also be limited by its danger; if a powerful spell can cause grave harm if miscast, wizards are likely to be wary of using it. Other forms of magic are limited by consequences that, while not inherently dangerous, are at least undesirable. In A Wizard of Earthsea, every act of magic distorts the equilibrium of the world, which in turn has far-reaching consequences that can affect the entire world and everything in it. As a result, competent wizards do not use their magic frivolously. In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, the Law of Conservation of Reality is a principle imposed by forces wanting wizards to not destroy the world, and works to limit how much power it is humanly possible to wield. Whatever your means, the effort put into reaching the ends stays the same. For example, when the wizards of Unseen University are chasing the hapless wizard Rincewind in the forest of Skund, the wizards send out search teams to go and find him on foot. The Archchancellor beats them to it by using a powerful spell from his own office, and while he gets there first by clever use of his spell, he has used no less effort than the others. Names and terminology People who work magic are called by several names in fantasy works, and terminology differs widely from one fantasy world to another. While derived from real-world vocabulary, the terms wizard, witch, warlock, enchanter/enchantress, sorcerer(ess), druid(ess), magician, mage, and magus have different meanings depending upon context and the story in question. The term archmage is used in fantasy works as a title for a powerful magician or a leader of magicians. =Reasons for distinguishing magicians= The Love Potion by Evelyn De Morgan (1903) In the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, Patricia Wrede depicts wizards who use magic based on their staves and magicians who practice several kinds of magic, including wizard magic; in the Regency fantasies, she and Caroline Stevermer depict magicians as identical to wizards, though inferior in skill and training. Steve Pemberton's The Times & Life of Lucifer Jones describes the distinction thus: \\"The difference between a wizard and a sorcerer is comparable to that between, say, a lion and a tiger, but wizards are acutely status-conscious, and to them, it's more like the difference between a lion and a dead kitten.\\" In David Eddings's The Belgariad and The Malloreon series, several protagonists refer to their abilities powered by sheer will as \\"sorcery\\" and look down on the term \\"magician\\", which specifically refers to summoners of demonic agents. In role- playing games, the types of magic-users are more delineated and are named so that the players and game masters can know which rules apply. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson introduced the term \\"magic-user\\" in the original Dungeons & Dragons as a generic term for a practitioner of magic (in order to avoid the connotations of terms such as wizard or warlock); this lasted until the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, where it was replaced with mage (later to become wizard). The exact rules vary from game to game. The wizard or mage, as a character class, is distinguished by the ability to cast certain kinds of magic but being weak in combat; subclasses are distinguished by strengths in some areas of magic and weakness in others. Sorcerers are distinguished from wizards as having an innate gift with magic, as well as having mystical or magical ancestry. Warlocks are distinguished from wizards as creating forbidden \\"pacts\\" with powerful creatures to harness their innate magical gifts. Enchanters often practice a type of magic that produces no physical effects on objects or people, but rather deceives the observer or target through the use of illusions. Enchantresses in particular practice this form of magic, often to seduce. For instance, the Lady of the Green Kirtle in C.S. Lewis's The Silver Chair enchants Rilian into forgetting his father and Narnia; when that enchantment is broken, she attempts further enchantments with a sweet-smelling smoke and a thrumming musical instrument to baffle him and his rescuers into forgetting them again. The term sorcerer is more frequently used when the magician in question is evil. This may derive from its use in sword and sorcery, where the hero would be the sword-wielder, leaving the sorcery for his opponent. Witch also carries evil connotations. L. Frank Baum named Glinda the \\"Good Witch of the South\\" in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In The Marvelous Land of Oz, he dubbed her \\"Glinda the Good,\\" and from that point forward and in subsequent books, Baum referred to her as a sorceress rather than a witch to avoid the term that was more regarded as evil. =Gender-based titles= Wizard usually refers to a male, while witch usually refers to a female. In Harry Potter, a man who anomalously showed the same abilities as a witch was called a wizard. The term wizard is sometimes used as a male counterpart of witch in fiction. However, either term may be used in a unisex manner, in which case there will be members of both sexes bearing that title. If both terms are used in the same setting, this can indicate a gender-based title for practitioners of identical magic, such as in Harry Potter, or it can indicate that there are people who practice different types of magic, as in Discworld. Although technically, the gender-specific term used for a male witch is actually Warlock. Traits of magicians hat A common motif in fiction is that the ability to use magic is innate and often rare, or gained through a large amount of study and practice. In J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, it is mostly limited to non-humans, though some people gain small amounts and become known as sorcerers (wizards being powerful spirits). In many writers' works, it is reserved for a select group of humans, such as in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, Katherine Kurtz's Deryni novels, or Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy universe. Education The Alchemist by William Fettes Douglas (1853): studying for arcane knowledge Magicians normally learn spells by reading ancient tomes called grimoires, which may have magical properties of their own. Sorcerers in Conan the Barbarian often gained powers from such books, which are demarcated by their strange bindings. In worlds where magic is not an innate trait, the scarcity of these strange books may be a facet of the story; in Poul Anderson's A Midsummer Tempest, Prince Rupert seeks out the books of the magician Prospero to learn magic. The same occurs in the Dungeons and Dragons-based novel series Dragonlance Chronicles, wherein Raistlin Majere seeks out the books of the sorcerer Fistandantilus. Some magicians, even after training, continue their education by learning more spells, inventing new ones (and new magical objects), or rediscovering ancient spells, beings, or objects. For example, Dr. Strange from the Marvel Universe continues to learn about magic even after being named Sorcerer Supreme. He often encounters creatures that haven't been seen for centuries or more. In the same universe, Dr. Doom continues to pursue magical knowledge after mastering it by combining magic with science. Fred and George Weasley from Harry Potter invent new magical items and sell them as legitimate defense items. Magical materials The Crystal Ball by John William Waterhouse (1902): using material for magical purposes; the crystal, a book, a skull, and a wand Historically, many self-proclaimed magicians have required rare and precious materials, such as crystal balls, rare herbs (often picked by prescribed rituals), and elements such as mercury. This is less common in fantasy. Many magicians require no materials at all; those that do may require only simple and easily obtained materials. Role-playing games are more likely to require such materials for at least some spells to prevent characters from casting them too easily. Wands and staves have long been used as requirements for the magician. The first magical wand was featured in the Odyssey, used by Circe to transform Odysseus's men into animals. Italian fairy tales put wands into the hands of powerful fairies by the late Middle Ages. Today, magical wands are widespread and are used from Witch World to Harry Potter. In The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf refuses to surrender his own staff, breaking Saruman's, which strips the latter of his power. This dependency on a particular magical item is common, and necessary to limit the magician's power for the story's sake ‚Äì without it, the magician's powers may be weakened or absent entirely. In the Harry Potter universe, a wizard must expend much greater effort and concentration to use magic without a wand, and only a few can control magic without one; taking away a wizard's wand in battle essentially disarms him. Use of magic Nevertheless, many magicians live in pseudo-medieval settings in which their magic is not put to practical use in society; they may serve as mentors, act as quest companions, or even go on a quest themselves, but their magic does not build roads or buildings, provide immunizations, construct indoor plumbing, or do any of the other functions served by machinery; their worlds remain at a medieval level of technology. Sometimes this is justified by having the negative effects of magic outweigh the positive possibilities. In Barbara Hambley's Windrose Chronicles, wizards are precisely pledged not to interfere because of the terrible damage they can do. In Discworld, the importance of wizards is that they actively do not do magic, because when wizards have access to sufficient \\"thaumaturgic energy\\", they develop many psychotic attributes and may eventually destroy the world. This may be a direct effect or the result of a miscast spell wreaking terrible havoc. In other works, developing magic is difficult. In Rick Cook's Wizardry series, the extreme danger presented by magic and the difficulty of analyzing the magic have stymied magic and left humanity at the mercy of the dangerous elves until a wizard summons a computer programmer from a parallel world ‚Äî ours ‚Äî to apply the skills he learned in our world to magic. At other times, magic and technology do develop in tandem; this is most common in the alternate history genre. Patricia Wrede's Regency fantasies include a Royal Society of Wizards and a technological level equivalent to the actual Regency; Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy series, Robert A. Heinlein's Magic, Incorporated, and Poul Anderson's Operation Chaos all depict modern societies with magic equivalent to twentieth-century technology. In Harry Potter, wizards have magical equivalents to non-magical inventions; sometimes they duplicate them, as with the Hogwarts Express train. The powers ascribed to magicians often affect their roles in society. In practical terms, their powers may give them authority; magicians may advise kings, such as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and Belgarath and Polgara the Sorceress in David Eddings's The Belgariad. They may be rulers themselves, as in E.R. Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros, where both the heroes and the villains, although kings and lords, supplement their physical power with magical knowledge, or as in Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus Trilogy, where magicians are the governing class. On the other hand, magicians often live like hermits, isolated in their towers and often in the wilderness, bringing no change to society. In some works, such as many of Barbara Hambly's, they are despised and outcast specifically because of their knowledge and powers. In the magic-noir world of the Dresden Files, wizards generally keep a low profile, though there is no explicit prohibition against interacting openly with non-magical humanity. The protagonist of the series, Harry Dresden, openly advertises in the Yellow Pages under the heading \\"Wizard\\" and maintains a business office, though other wizards tend to resent him for practicing his craft openly. Dresden primarily uses his magic to make a living finding lost items and people, performing exorcisms, and providing protection against the supernatural. In the series Sorcerous Stabber Orphen human forms of life should have only been capable of acquiring divine magic powers through individual spiritual development, whereas the race of human magicians with inborn magical ability ended in conflict with pureblood human society, because this race appeared as a result of an experiment of mixing humans with non-human sentient Heavenly Beings that acquired magic powers not through spiritual development, but through deep studying of laws of nature and by falsely causing the world‚Äôs laws to react to actions of the Heavenly Beings as to actions of Divinities.

Before partition in 1947, Hirabad was a thriving township of wealthy Hindu Sindwork merchants and traders who generally belonged to the Amil and Bhaiband castes of Hindu Lohanas. When the town was settled in the 1920s and 1930s, these Hindu merchants build extravagant palatial houses for themselves. Following Partition, Hindu elites left their homeland leaving behind their properties to be taken over by Muslim refugees who had fled from India.  History  Tombs of Talpur Mirs (or cubbas; c. 1900), a few decades before the development of Hirabad. Before its development and eventual occupation, the geography of Hirabad mainly consisted dry field plains with a sparse distribution of hillocks. The Talpur dynasty of Sindh saw it as a favourable place to erect magnificent mausoleums for their family, not much farther from the Sindh‚Äôs capital Hyderabad. For some time, these were the only structures in the area until the land was used to develop a new residential locality. = Late 19th and early 20th century = The Hyderabad taluka was a mofussil (small town) and had a large population of Sindhi Hindu Lohanas, an Indian caste of merchants and traders. Chiefly amongst these were the Amils and Bhaibands. The Amils were a well-educated and travelled people who occupied the uppermost rung of the social ladder, whilst the Bhaibands were considered slightly less polished. There was a lesser population of Muslims who had been converted, after Muhammad bin Qasim's conquest of Sindh, principally from Bhaibands and had adopted Memon or Khatri (derived from Kshatriya) as their defining identity; these were mostly landowning zamindars. The Amils and Bhaibands lived in the oldest part of the city, occupying whole streets in the bazaar area (now Shahi Bazaar) of Hyderabad, and were mostly Sindwork merchants and traders who spent much of their time abroad. In the mid-1930s, growing tensions following the Spanish Civil War adversely affected the operations of these merchants and they started returning to Hyderabad. This contributed to a sudden growth in the population of the town which resulted in ‚Äúa considerable physical expansion‚Äù. = Development of Hirabad = The Hyderabad Municipality, having already drafted plans for town expansion since its constitution in 1853, started developing a new residential neighbourhood, north of the old city bazaar, in order to accommodate the growing numbers of people. Finally settled in the 1920s and 1930s, this new residential area started being called Hirabad (lit. \\"town of diamonds\\"), known so for its inhabitants who were mainly bankers, clerks and jewellers. Seeing this as an opportunity to set themselves apart, the Amils relocated to this newly developed neighbourhood. Some Bhaibands and wealthier merchant firms followed, but still considered the older town a more favourable location even when Hirabad boasted better drainage facilities and electricity. As these rich merchants moved into the locality, they had ‚Äúpalatial mansions‚Äù built for themselves. It was because of this extravagance that the Hyderabadis were considered ‚Äú‚Äòtownies‚Äô with ‚Äòrefined taste‚Äô‚Äù. = Post-partition migration = Following the Partition of British India, Sindhi Hindus migrated from their homeland to the Hindu majority areas of India, barely escaping the violent attacks of the Muslim refugees who fled anti-Muslim violence India and settled in Hyderabad. In doing so, the Hindus evicted and abandoned their palatial houses which were then immediately occupied by the Muslim migrants. The new impoverished refugee occupants who had themselves been forced to abandon their property in India had little to no regard for the architectural values of these buildings and, soon after, these buildings fell into disrepair. The Hindu Sindworkis of Hyderabad liquidated whatever assets they had and left their homeland with all the belongings, losing all their immovable properties in Hyderabad. It was easier for these families to move from one place to another as their livelihood remained intact and ‚Äú[Sindh] was not at all an essential part of their business operations‚Äù.

Yates (born 1946) is an economist and a labor educator, and editorial director of the socialist publishing house Monthly Review Press. He advocates a socialist view of economics.Stevenson, Labour/Le Travail, #55 (Spring 2005). Early life and education Yates was born in a small coal mining town about 40 miles north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His grandmother worked on a barge boat as a cook and a servant for families in Manhattan, Newport and other wealthy enclaves. His immediate family had a long history working at dangerous, unhealthy jobs in the coal mines. At the age of 14, his mother took a job unloading dynamite at the entrance of the coal mines. His mother, uncle and grandmother all suffered from severe asthma from the dust generated by the mines. His father suffered emphysema from inhaling asbestos and silica dust at work.Seidman, Counterpunch, Nov. 26, 2003. Life for the Yates family was a difficult one, as it was for most working people. Yates' father worked in a large glass factory several miles away. The first Yates home did not have hot running water or an indoor toilet, and was owned by the mining company. When Michael was one year old, his parents moved the family to an old house on the farm of a family friend. There was now hot water but still no indoor plumbing. A few years later, the family moved again, to a newly built house closer to the glass factory. Nearly every relative, neighbor and friend Yates knew, from the mining village to the factory town, was in the working class. He describes in this way in his book, Can the Working Class Change the World? :BY ANY IMAGINABLE DEFINITION of the working class, I was born into it. Almost every member of my extended family‚Äîparents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins‚Äîwere wage laborers. They mined coal, hauled steel, made plate glass, labored on construction sites and as office secretaries, served the wealthy as domestic workers, clerked in company stores, cleaned offices and homes, took in laundry, cooked on tugboats, even unloaded trucks laden with dynamite. I joined the labor force at twelve and have been in it ever since, delivering newspapers, serving as a night watchman at a state park, doing clerical work in a factory, grading papers for a professor, selling life insurance, teaching in colleges and universities, arbitrating labor disputes, consulting for attorneys, desk clerking at a hotel, editing a magazine and books. I have spearheaded union organizing campaigns and helped in others. For more than thirty years, I taught workers in several labor studies programs, people in every imaginable occupation, from plumbers, bricklayers, postal employees, chemical workers, garment workers, and elevator operators to librarians, nurses, airline pilots, firefighters, and teachers. I once worked for the United Farm Workers Union, meeting campesinos and campesinas and helping them in legal disputes and collective bargaining. These experiences had a deep impact on Yates, radicalizing him. As the Vietnam War intensified while he was a graduate student, his leftist tendencies strengthened: :I am sure that the experience of growing up in the heart of the working class and learning from my parents, and especially from my grandmother ... that life was not especially fair and always full of bad possibilities, helped shape my future take on life. Then what really transformed my thinking was the war in Vietnam and trying to be a good teacher. The war was so obviously evil and bore down most heavily upon working class youth that it made me think about things more deeply than I had before. It disillusioned me completely and forever about the government. And it made me aware that the media and the government lied almost as a matter of course. But it also opened my eyes to what was really going on in this country. Yates attended graduate school at the University of Pittsburgh (UP) from 1967 to 1973, although only the first two years were full-time. Teaching and later career In the summer of 1968, Yates received his induction notice. With the encouragement of an academic advisor, he applied for a teaching position at UP's satellite campus in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. He was appointed an assistant professor in 1969. He worked part-time on his degree while teaching. Teaching deepened his radicalism, and he abandoned once and for all the neoclassical economics he had been taught. He also participated in union organizing activities, first with the maintenance and custodial workers on campus and then with the teachers. Yates received his Ph.D. in economics from UP in 1976. He was given tenure by UP shortly after completing his doctorate. During a sabbatical leave in 1977, he served as director of research for the United Farm Workers Union at union headquarters in Keene, California. He left during a purge of union staff by union president Cesar Chavez. Although Yates continued to teach at UP-Johnstown, in 1980 he began to teach workers and labor activists as well. He traveled all over the state of Pennsylvania and into West Virginia and Ohio, educating workers about labor unions, their right to form a union, and economics. He taught for many years in the Labor Center at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, where his students were union officers and members. Yates began a long-time relationship with Monthly Review in the mid-1970s. He has published many articles in the publication over the years. The relationship between Yates and MR's editorial staff grew close. Monthly Review Press eventually agreed to publish Yates' first book, Longer Hours, Fewer Jobs: Employment and Unemployment in the United States. Three more books and a co-edited volume followed. He also began to perform some editing work for the magazine. During the mid-1980s Yates divorced his first wife and several years later married a second time. He has four children. In 2001, Yates retired from his position at UP-Johnstown. He and his wife began to live an itinerant existence, spending significant amounts of time in Yellowstone National Park, Manhattan, Miami Beach and Portland, Oregon. In between, they have lived on the road, staying in motels, hotels, hostels, and short-term furnished housing. These travels were documented in the book Cheap Motels and a Hotplate. As of 2019, he and his wife have been on the road for eighteen years. After his retirement, Yates became in 2001 associate editor at Monthly Review. In 2006, he became the editorial director of Monthly Review Press. As director, he has edited more than fifty titles. In 2018, he retired as associate editor of Monthly Review.

A later concert in Moscow, on 5 September 1942, was delayed by a Nazi air raid and started late. Prokofiev thought it \\"an extremely turbulent success.\\" The string quartet, lasting for 20‚Äì25 minutes, is in three movements. Background Prokofiev, along with other Soviet artists, was evacuated from the major cities when the Nazis broke their non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. On August 8, 1941, Prokofiev traveled to Nalchik with other artists, among them his friend, musician Nikolai Myaskovsky, actors, such as Anton Chekhov's widow, and others. Prokofiev stayed in the town of Nalchik, the provincial capital of the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous SSR, in the North Caucasus, about 900 miles south of Moscow (bordered by the European Russia, Turkey, and the Black and Caspian Seas). During this stay, Prokofiev was told by a government official to write a quartet using Kabardino-Balkar folk themesBaron, John H. (1998). , p. 401 and wrote this string quartet, with themes based on folk tunes, rhythms and textures. This quartet, along with the first, has entered the repertory of many string quartets. Movements #Allegro sostenuto #Adagio #Allegro Analysis Prokofiev utilized Kabardino- Balkar folk themes in his string quartet, while at the same retaining his unique style of harmonization. The folk music character is made evident by the string quartet's imitation of oriental plucked and percussion instruments, combined with resourceful use of sonic effects. The background accompaniment in the second movement attempts to imitate the playing of a Caucasian stringed instrument, the kjamantchi. Nikolai Myaskovsky, Prokofiev's close friend, wrote two works on Kabardino-Balkar themes, his 23rd symphony and 7th string quartet. The symphony shares a theme with the finale of Prokofiev's quartet.

Early life and family estate The son of Oliver Ingraham Lay, a professional painter, and Hester Marian Wait Lay, Charles Downing Lay was born in Newburgh, New York. At age 7, Lay began spending summers with his grandmother in Stratford, Connecticut. Her house was located at 95 Chapel Street, which is approximately away from the banks of the Housatonic River. Lay spent much of his childhood in Stratford fishing, sailing, and swimming and developed a great appreciation for nature. The Housatonic, along with the Long Island Sound, would greatly influence the course of Lay's career. Lay inherited his grandmother's estate, the land he first fell in love with, in 1900 and he remained there until his death in 1956. The property was not extensive and although the landscape was informal, there was little to suggest a truly naturalistic landscape. Walls, ramps, and steps with planting occupied the slope between houses, with interesting plants planted in a casual manner. There was little space between the houses and the country road to the north; the outdoor living areas were focused on the south view toward Long Island. These areas were bounded by old stone walls with large lawns and perennial borders surrounding the grounds. Always planning further improvements, he often experimented in growing new plants. In 1947, shortly before retirement, Lay bought in Lyme, Connecticut, near Selden Creek, where he spent time with his wife and family during the summers. He described this land as \\"farm grown to woods which I subconsciously had been longing for.\\" Education and career Lay attended the School of Architecture at Columbia University from 1896 to 1900 before transferring to Harvard University's School of Landscape Architecture, from which he graduated in 1902, the second man to achieve a Bachelor of Science degree in the field. The first, Henry Hubbard, had been Lay's teacher when Lay was working on his M.L.A. in 1906-1908 and in 1910, Hubbard and Lay, in partnership with Robert Wheelwright, opened a landscape architecture firm in New York City. They practiced under the name Lay, Hubbard, and Wheelwright and began publishing the professional journal Landscape Architecture in October 1910. In 1911, the journal was named the official publication of the American Society of Landscape Architects, a title it still holds today. Lay served as an editor and manager until 1921. Aware of significant population growth in American cities during the early 20th-century, Lay became increasingly concerned with the availability of urban outdoor space. He worked for New York City's Parks Department from 1913‚Äì1914 and proposed improvements to Albany, New York. During World War I, Lay was a planner for the United States Housing Corporation and served as a consultant on the planning and development of Navy air and service stations during World War II. In addition to a wide variety of commissions from private clients, Lay designed public parks in New York City; Albany; Troy, New York; Schenectady, New York; Brooklyn; Washington, D.C.; and Stratford, Connecticut; well as for the United States Housing Corporation in Erie, Pennsylvania and Butler, Pennsylvania. Building on his interest in urban planning, he developed some of the first subdivisions in suburban New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Interested in providing greater access to outdoor space for citizens of New York City, Lay also completed a study for a Nassau County, New York, park system, which now numbers 83 parks. In addition to his other accomplishments, Lay received a silver medal from the 1936 Berlin Olympics for his work on Marine Park in Brooklyn. Projects Charles Downing Lay designed or contributed to the design of countless parks, subdivisions, private estates, and gardens throughout the United States, although his influence was most apparent on the East Coast. Some of his major projects include: *Marine Park, Brooklyn *Battery Park, New York City *Bryant Park, New York City *John Jay Park, New York City *Madison Square Park, New York City *Initial design of the grounds for the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C. Legacy In his professional writings and landscape practice, Lay frequently advocated for a closer relationship between man and nature and argued that natural resources could be beneficial for society if not misused. His lifelong love for the landscape around Statford, Connecticut, led Lay to found the Housatonic Valley Conference in 1937, later renamed the Housatonic Valley Association. The HVA now protects all of the tri-state region known as the Housatonic River Valley.

He believed that research should be used to develop knowledge that could be applied to policies in support of public interest and the disenfranchised in the face of private capital. He focused his research on mass media and telecommunications. Some of his main ideas included the \\"invisible triangle\\" (broadcasters, advertisers and audience members), and the \\"audience commodity\\". Much of his efforts were the result of his attempts to differentiate between Administrative and Critical Communications research.  Background and education  Dallas Walker Smythe was born in 1907 in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. His father ran a hardware store in Regina, and his mother was a nurse from Caledonia. His parents married in 1906. His father was a Presbyterian, and his mother followed the Church of England. Religion was important in his early childhood. The family didn't follow any particular church, but often read the passages in the New Testament that discussed the ethical principles of Christianity, which held ideas of primitive socialism. As a child, he almost died of the flu, and subsequently his family moved to Pasadena, California, in search of a healthier climate. Encouraged by his junior college economics teacher, Smythe wrote an essay for a national contest and won $100. This encouraged him to pursue economics and become a teacher. Smythe was shy in junior college and didn't date much. He eventually married Beatrice Bell, the first woman he fell in love with. After studying at the University of California, Los Angeles, in his third year of junior college, he finished his degree at the University of California, Berkeley, achieving his A.B. in Economics in 1928. Later that year, he entered the Ph.D. Economics program at Berkeley, where he undertook a seven-year thesis on the East San Francisco transit system.  Government career and impetus for applied social science research  After finishing his Ph.D., Dallas W. Smythe worked for 14 years in various government departments as an economist: the Department of Agriculture (1934‚Äì1947), Central Statistics Board (1937‚Äì1938), the Department of Labor (1938‚Äì1941), the Federal Communications Commission (1943‚Äì1948). During his time at the F.C.C, Smythe helped create the Blue Book, which administered telecommunications policy until the 1960s. During his time working with the government, his ideas about social justice, social science research and the media were shaped by a number of events. The shooting of picketers by the National Guard at the San Francisco Longshore Strike, and the plight of drought-driven farmers of Midwest during the Depression demonstrated to Smythe the vagaries of class struggle. However, it was his concern for the Spanish Civil War and the citizens' struggle against fascism that led him to being involved with the American League for Peace and Democracy, which promoted education and political action to help lift the arms embargo. Later, when he applied for position as Economics Professor at University of Illinois, Urbana, his appointment was attacked with fallacies about his former activities. J. Edgar Hoover refused to give his FBI files to the university administration. However, the attorney general intervened and Smythe was duly appointed to the University of Illinois, where he taught Communications and Economics until 1963. During the period of McCarthyism, Smythe found it difficult to get articles published or to get money to fund research. He left the US after the Cuban Missile Crisis, because he feared for his family's welfare in the US. The Smythe family moved to Canada in 1963, and Dallas found a job teaching Communication and Economics at the University of Saskatchewan for the next 10 years. Later, he became professor in the Communication Department at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, from 1974 until his death in 1992 at age of 85. Smythe died in Langley, British Columbia.  Major works   In G. Gerbner (Ed.) Ferment in the Field  School of thought  Smythe applied social science methodologies against the flows of the capitalist system. He believed that a researcher must be engaged with the social processes studied. Overall, Smythe wanted to expose political and economic power relations that were reproduced in institutional relations, embedded in technology and represented in communications. His theoretical approach was social realism, which acknowledged that institutions and policies mediate cultural realism. He also used Critical Marxist theory, which he posited did not have to be explicitly Marxist, but must be critical of phenomena in their systemic context.  Key concepts  Probably one of his most influential ideas was that of the 'audience-commodity'. In \\"Communications: Blindspot of Western Marxism\\", Smythe writes about monopoly capitalism's dissolution of the boundary between an individual's role as worker and buyer. Smythe believed that all non-sleeping time is work time. Work time is devoted to the production of commodities, producing and reproducing labour power. Time away from work, but not asleep is sold as a commodity to advertisers. This is the audience commodity, which perform marketing functions and work at the production and reproduction of labour power. Smythe cites that media produces audiences and then they sold to advertisers. After that, advertisers have to create media content which can attract audiences' attention and when audiences actually focus or pay attention to something, they are selling their time and consciousness to advertisers. This time and consciousness can be referred to as \\"watching power\\". Besides, Smythe also mentions about \\"consumption as problem-solving\\", \\"customers don't buy things. They buy tools to solve problems\\" . From this definition, we can understand the general idea is that if people want to be a part of community, they must purchase for the stuffs which symbolize that community. A contemporary mention of Smythes concept of \\"audience commodity\\" is to find in a 2012 event and discussion between Jacob Appelbaum and Dmytri Kleiner about ‚ÄúResisting the Surveillance State and its network effects‚Äù at the 2012 re-publica in Berlin. Kleiner introduces Smythes ideas in order to re-contextualize the controversies about Social Media and privacy. To regain an understanding of the ways media is funded by ways of commoditizing their audience means to build a better understanding how the economic fundamentals of the media business conflicts with privacy concerns. \\"Audience commodity\\" is here a key concept, translated into the contemporary debate about Social Media, post-privacy and surveillance. Other ideas include \\"cultural screens\\", which denote a struggle over the terms of national development with regard to which class it would serve, \\"audience power\\", whereby the consciousness industry is resisted by people and older institutions and \\"cultural realism\\", where the central values of a system are expressed in artifacts, practices and institutions. Smythe also believed that technology is the result of social systems values and policies, which it reproduces regardless of judicial issues, and that science and technique are political, involving choice of problems to study and knowledge to practice.

It originally aired on TNT on January 22, 2001. Plot The story reunites the entire cast from the series, effectively picking up where the season four cliffhanger ended. Jarod Sur Venom (Michael T. Weiss), Ethan, and Miss Parker (Andrea Parker) are alive after the bomb explosion on the train. Jarod is now posing as an agent of the National Security Agency; he is part of a task force assembled to find the \\"Chameleon\\", a killer who displays all the adaptive traits of a Pretender. The Centre is forced to put its hunt for Jarod on hold after its administrator, Mr. Parker (Harve Presnell) is abducted. Miss Parker discovers that William Raines (Richard Marcus) is still alive, despite allegedly being shot dead by her father. Her brother, Mr. Lyle (James Denton), attempts to finish Raines off, but Miss Parker manages to spirit him away and hide him in her house. In return, Raines agrees to shed light on who might have kidnapped her father. Jarod begins receiving taunting clues from the Chameleon, which leads him to believe that the killer holds a grudge against him personally. This revelation takes Jarod back to the days leading up to his escape from the Centre; he did not originally plan to leave alone. Jarod hatched a plan with two fellow Pretenders, including a man named Alex (Peter Outerbridge), to escape from the facility together. Unfortunately, Alex was captured during their escape. He was swiftly sent out of the country and endured hideous torture by his captors; Alex now wants revenge on Jarod as a result. Observing that Jarod's search for his biological family has allowed the Centre to continue to dominate him, Alex took the opposite path by finding his own family and then murdering them. From his perspective, this has 'freed' him from the Centre's control; however, he is still not satisfied and kidnaps Mr. Parker with the intent of killing him too. After incriminating evidence that points to Jarod is left behind by Alex, Jarod's partners at the NSA suspect him of being the \\"Chameleon.\\" The Centre's programmer, Broots (Jon Gries), is on Jarod's trail when he is swept up in the NSA investigation and thrown into an interrogation room. Jarod immediately recognizes Broots, but decides to cover up for him rather than risk exposing them both. As Jarod is escorting Broots out of the NSA building, Jarod's partners move in to arrest them both. Jarod flees in a vehicle with Broots in tow, then later ditches him by the side of the road. At the climax, Jarod thwarts Alex's next assassination and helps free Mr. Parker. Before he commits suicide, Alex gloats that the truth of Jarod's true identity will die with him. Mr. Parker is injured during the struggle and rendered catatonic. As Jarod and Miss Parker exchange words over the phone, both of them receive an anonymous email simultaneously; the message contains an image of two women, the mothers of Miss Parker and Jarod, standing together. The email is revealed to have been sent by Mr. Raines himself, apparently as a show of thanks for rescuing him.  Cast  *Michael T.

Three weeks after the events of Hurricane Katrina, then Governor Kathleen Blanco said that Charity Hospital would not reopen as a functioning hospital. The Louisiana State University System, which owns the building, stated that it had no plans to reopen the hospital in its original location. It chose to incorporate Charity Hospital into the city's new medical center in the lower Mid-City neighborhood. The new hospital completed in August 2015 was named University Medical Center New Orleans. Organization Charity Hospital was one of several public hospitals around the state of Louisiana administered by the Louisiana State University System at the time of Hurricane Katrina. Charity Hospital and the nearby University Hospital were both teaching hospitals affiliated with the LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO). University Hospital, later called Interim LSU Hospital, closed in 2015. Prior to Katrina, Charity Hospital operated in the New Orleans Hospital District at 1532 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112-1352. The building is approximately six-tenths of a mile on the opposite side of I-10 from Interim LSU Hospital. History Ambulance, 1912 Charity Hospital was founded on May 10, 1736, by a grant from Jean Louis, a French sailor and shipbuilder, who died in New Orleans the year before. His last will and testament was to finance a hospital for the indigent in the colony of New Orleans from his estate. Charity Hospital was originally named the Hospital of Saint John or L‚ÄôH√¥pital des Pauvres de la Charit√© (The Charity Hospital for the Poor). The first Charity Hospital was located on the intersection of Chartres Street and Bienville Street in what is now the French Quarter. The hospital was founded 18 years after the city was founded by France in 1718. It was the second oldest continuously operated public hospital in the United States. Only Bellevue Hospital in New York City is older, having been founded a month earlier, on March 31, 1736. Charity Hospital quickly outgrew its original facility, and a second hospital was built at the edge of the colony on Basin Street in 1743. A third hospital was built nearby in 1785. It was renamed the San Carlos Hospital in honor of King Charles III, King of Spain, after New Orleans was ceded to Spain in 1763. The old Charity Hospital building at the start of the 20th century A fire destroyed this hospital in 1809. Without a building, a temporary hospital was established at the Cabildo for a month, then at the Jourdan residence in the Faubourg Marigny for six months, then the dilapidated De La Vergne plantation for 5 years while a fourth hospital was built. This new hospital was built at the edge of the city on Canal Street where The Roosevelt New Orleans Hotel is currently located. The hospital was completed in 1815, but this hospital was widely criticized as inadequate and underfunded. In 1832, a fifth hospital was built on Common Street (modern Tulane Avenue) between Howard Street (modern LaSalle Street), Robertson Street, and Gravier Street, on the edge of the Faubourg St. Marie.Campanella, Richard. Lost New Orleans, p. 52-53. London, United Kingdom: Pavilion Books, 2015 This hospital came under the administration of the Sisters of Charity in 1834,Daughters of Charity Foundation of New Orleans website. http://dcsno.org/foundation/inside.php?page=history who would run the hospital for the next century. Under their care, Charity Hospital, partnered with the Medical College of the University of Louisiana. During the yellow fever epidemic of 1858, 2727 patients were admitted and of them 1382 died of the disease. Total patient admission that year was 11,337, being 9135 males and 2202 females.September 3, 1859 Harper's Weekly article titled The New Orleans Charity Hospital on pages 569 and 570. https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027985541;view=1up;seq=549 By the 20th century, the city of New Orleans was rapidly expanding, and the demand for indigent medical services again exceeded Charity Hospital capacity. A sixth hospital was built on Tulane Avenue in 1939. At the time it was the second largest hospital in the United States with 2,680 beds. Main entry of Charity Hospital The building's cornerstone lists the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works (later called the Public Works Administration) as the building authority. The architects were Weiss, Dreyfous & Seiferth, who were also responsible for the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. The hospital features two stone bas-reliefs and a cast-aluminum screen called Louisiana at Work and Play, all by artist Enrique Alf√©rez. The LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) was built adjacent to Charity Hospital in 1931 under the aegis of Louisiana Governor Huey Pierce Long.Long established the LSU School of Medicine after the adjacent Tulane University School of Medicine demonstrated its independence from the governor's control. See Alton Ochsner. Serving one of the largest populations of uninsured citizens, Charity Hospital also boasted the #2 Level I Trauma Center in the nation, with the #1 rank belonging to Cook County Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. In 1968, the hospital lost a malpractice case before the U.S. Supreme Court. In Louise Levy, Administratrix v. Louisiana through the Charity Hospital of Louisiana at New Orleans Board of Administrators, et al., the court ruled that a child born out of wedlock could not be prevented from suing on behalf of a deceased parent. The Louisiana Department of Health and Human Resources (DHH) took control of Charity Hospital in 1970. The hospital was transferred to the Louisiana Health Care Authority (LHCA) in 1991 and to the LSU System in 1997. =Hurricane Katrina= Like its sister hospital, University Hospital, Charity Hospital sustained severe flood damage during Hurricane Katrina. The evacuation of patients from the flooded hospital made national headlines. After the storm, a temporary clinic named the Spirit of Charity was established at the Convention Center. The temporary Spirit of Charity Clinic was later relocated to the New Orleans Centre building adjacent to the Superdome. In February 2007, a renovated University Hospital had taken over interim responsibilities of emergency care to the city which Charity originally provided.CNN. Patients finally rescued from Charity Hospital. In August 2015, the LSU Health Sciences Center completed the new $1.1 billion medical center named University Medical Center New Orleans. The hospital consolidated the functions of both the already closed Charity Hospital and University Hospital. =Failed campaign to rebuild Charity Hospital= The Foundation for Historical Louisiana, as charged in HCR 89 of the 2006 Louisiana Legislature, hired the internationally renowned architectural firm, RMJM Hillier, to \\"‚Ä¶examine and evaluate the entire Big Charity structure to determine the advisability of repairing or restructuring the entire facility.\\" RMJM Hillier determined the art deco building to be structurally sound‚Äîwith its original design being architecturally exceptional and \\"ahead of its time.\\" Rehabilitation into a 21st-century, state-of-the-art facility would be the fastest, most cost-effective way to return quality healthcare and a teaching hospital to New Orleans. This idea was scrubbed in favor of using University Hospital as an interim hospital and building University Medical Center New Orleans and a new Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System Medical Center in the adjacent neighborhood of lower Mid-City.  Plans to re-develop the site  There have been several efforts to renovate or restore Charity Hospital. In October 2019, LSU, the organization that has owned the structure since the 2005 evacuation and subsequent closure of the hospital, approved a re-development project to turn the former hospital into a mix of homes, retail space and other facilities. The redevelopment project has been long awaited by city leaders hoping to revitalize the former \\"booming\\" central business district that has been suffering since the closure of Charity and surrounding buildings due to Hurricane Katrina. The contract was awarded to a group called 1532 Tulane Partners, a joint venture between New Orleans-based CCNO and Israeli development company El-Ad Group. Work is expected to begin on the giant building in fall 2019 and construction should take 3 years. The redevelopment project is expected to cost $300 million that will be partly funded by tax credits, and the building will not be subject to property tax as the building will still be owned by LSU. The structure will include about 390 residential units plus retail shops and restaurants. Tulane University will serve as the main tenant of the building as they will use it for student housing and offices. The main entrance to Charity Hospital from Tulane Ave. The fire escape stairway view from Tulane Ave. Television Charity Hospital was featured in the TLC documentary series, Code Blue. The series documented the lives of the hospital physicians and their patients. The episodes often illustrated the rate of violence in New Orleans by chronicling the high volume of patients who were treated in the emergency department with gunshot or stab wounds. Charity Hospital was also featured in two episodes of TLC's Trauma: Life in the ER, which focused on Charity's emergency department,. Charity Hospital was also in an episode of NY Med, where a doctor reminisces of his time spent at the hospital.

The novel was intended as an indictment of what Burgess saw as the degradation of contemporary Western education and culture. Burgess deliberately toned down his trademark love of vocabulary for the novel, which among other things lampoons the British television host Hughie Green. The entire vocabulary in One Hand Clapping amounts to approximately 800 words. Title The line, \\"Two hands clap and there is a sound; what is the sound of one hand?\\" is a traditional Zen koan, and the novel takes its title from this. Burgess explained the title as follows: \\"The clasped hands of marriage have been reduced [by the novel's end] to a single hand. Yet it claps.\\" The phrase One Hand Clapping if translated literally into the Malay language means \\"Bertepuk sebelah tangan\\", which usually means unrequited love (when used in context of a relationship or romantic feelings). The English saying \\"It takes two to tango\\" gives the same connotation as \\"Bertepuk sebelah tangan\\". Another Anthony Burgess novel, The Enemy in The Blanket, is also a literal translation of a Malay proverb (\\"Musuh Dalam Selimut\\"). Plot Howard has an unusual talent: he has a photographic memory. He uses his talent to enter, and win, a mega-money TV quiz show. He then discloses another gift: he is clairvoyant and can predict racing results. He gambles his winnings on race horses and the couple become extremely wealthy and travel the world, staying in luxury hotels. On their return, however, Howard, disgusted by the corruption of the world they have seen - and troubled by prophetic glimpses of a coming decline in civilisation - declares that they must commit suicide together by barbiturates. Janet resists, killing Howard with a coal hammer. Janet flees with the remainder of their money, to begin a new life abroad, taking her husband with her in a chest. Characters Janet Shirley - The narrator and point of view through which the reader sees the novel. She introduces herself as \\"Janet Shirley, n√©e Barnes ... just gone twenty-three.\\" Burgess portrays her voice using a spartan vocabulary. Howard Shirley - Aged 27 and the husband of Janet. At the novel's opening, he is working at a used car dealership. He is an average man living an average life in Britain.

It is a municipal council situated in Daman district of the union territory. Daman Ganga River divides Daman into two parts ‚Äî Nani-Daman (nani meaning \\"small\\") and Moti-Daman (Moti meaning \\"big\\"). Despite its name, Nani-Daman is the larger of the two parts, while the old city is mainly in Moti-Daman. This holds most of the important entities like the major hospitals, supermarkets and major residential areas. Vapi, Gujarat is the nearest city to Daman.  History  The Portuguese Diogo de Melo arrived at the spot by chance in 1523, when heading towards Ormuz. He was caught in a violent storm and had his boat blown towards the coast of Daman. Soon after, it was settled as a Portuguese colony which lasted for over 400 years. A larger fort was built in Moti Daman in the 16th century to guard against the Mughals who ruled the area until the Portuguese arrived. It stands today, most of it preserved in its original form. Today the majority of the municipal government offices are inside the fort. Daman was incorporated into the Republic of India in December 1961 after a battle between the Portuguese and the Indians. The battle left four Indians dead and 14 wounded; Portuguese casualties were 10 dead and two wounded.Chakravorty, Dr. B.C. (2008). \\"Operation Vijay\\" . Bharat Rakshak. Retrieved 12/18/2010.

The individual chapters were collected and published in tank≈çbon volumes; by Biblos, from 2002 until 2005, when the company went out of business. In 2007, Libre picked up the series, reprinting the first three volumes before continuing its release. In 2007, Biblos licensed the series for English language release to Central Park Media, which began publishing the series under its Be Beautiful Manga imprint. In 2006, Biblos filed for bankruptcy and some of its properties were acquired by Libre Publishing. Libre later accused Central Park Media of infringing on its copyright of the transferred Biblos properties, stating that all foreign license holders needed to negotiate new licenses with Libre as those Biblos had sold ended with the company's bankruptcy. In a letter posted to its website, it asked readers not to purchase any Be Beautiful releases, calling them \\"illegal\\". John O'Donnell, then manager of Central Park Media refused Libre's claims and felt that Biblos's original license agreements were still valid. In 2009, the company filed for bankruptcy and its assets, including licenses, were liquidated. Finder Series was not listed among the assets, indicating Central Park Media no longer held the license. In March 2010, Digital Manga Publishing announced that it had acquired the English license to the Finder Series and published under their yaoi-oriented line, Jun√©.

Finder Series has been released in several other languages too, including Chinese, Korean, French, Polish and Italian. On June 18, 2016, Digital Media announced that its licensing agreement with Libre Publishing was going to terminate at the end of the month. Thus, all of Libre's titles, including the \\"Finder Series,\\" were no longer going to be published with Digital Media Publishing. Digital Media president Hikaru Sasahara said the company was \\"stunned\\" at Libre's decision, and called the move \\"unjust.\\" In response, while Libre expressed surprise at Digital Media's decision, they noted that the agreement had been \\"terminated some time ago under just cause due to a breach of contract.\\" It was announced on July 7, 2016 that Viz Media had acquired the licensing arrangements to publish the series under its Boys Love label \\"SuBLime.\\" Since Volume 8 was released in Japan in May 2016, SubLime stated that they would publish Volume 8 first by March 2017, and then republish the first seven volumes every other month beginning in May 2017.

The entire municipality extends along a valley surrounded by woods. The ancient village of the village is completely surrounded by mountains, among which there are peaks over 1,000 meters above sea level. Surrounded by mountains, the village itself leans at the foot of a mountain, Mount Guadagnolo (1218 meters above sea level). The top of the mountain has a rather unique appearance, so much so that it is called the alpine cliff of the Guadagnolo or cliff of the Guadagnolo, it is a mountain of calcareous composition, like the whole area. Guadagnolo is part of the municipality of Capranica Prenestina, which is about 10 km. Main sights In its history, however, it has also been linked to the fate of Poli: in fact, in the twelfth century, were possessions of Odo III, who then ceded them to the family of the Counts, who ruled these territories for six centuries, after which the possessions passed into the hands of other houses. The connection of the two territories was made official in 1826, a connection that lasted until 1930, when Guadagnolo passed under the municipality of Capranica Prenestina, of which it is still part. The two villages, since their foundation more than a thousand years ago, have always been linked by a common fate and for about 800 years they were part of the same fief. Since 2010, a panoramic road has been opened, which can also be accessed by cars, which connects Poli directly to Guadagnolo. There are, however, nature trails that lead from the cliff of Guadagnolo to different destinations, including Poli.

The huge edifice in gothic architecture was built in 1598. A part of it has been converted into a museum - an archaeological treasure house. The artifacts displayed date back to the 16th century and beyond. In evening, multicolored fountains and special lighting of the imposing building fascinate everyone. Forts =Diu Fort= Diu Fort Diu The Diu Fort, is located on the west coast of India in Diu, a Union Territory, administered by the Government of India. The fort was built by the Portuguese during their colonial rule of the Diu island. The Diu town is located to the west of the fort. The fort was built in 1535 subsequent to a defense alliance forged by Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat and the Portuguese when Humayun, the Mughal Emperor, waged war to annex this territory. Some additions made in 1541 and the fort was strengthened over the years, till 1546. Portuguese ruled over this territory from 1537 (from the year they took control of the fort and also the Diu town fully) until 1961. They were forced to quit only in December 1961 (even though India became an independent country in 1947) during a military action called the Operation Vijay launched by the Government of India, and thereafter Diu was annexed by India as a centrally administered Union Territory. This massive, fairly well-preserved Portuguese fort with its double moat must once have been impregnable. But years of sea erosion and neglect are leading to its slow collapse. Cannonballs litter the place, and the ramparts have a superb array of cannons. The lighthouse is Diu's highest point, with a beam that reaches 32 km in every direction. There are several small chapels, one holding engraved tombstone fragments. Part of the fort also serves as the island's jail. =Fortim do Mar= Built right at the mouth of the creek, the fortress of Fortim do Mar (Sea Fort or Pani-Kotha) is a magnificent stone structure in the sea. Approximately one nautical mile (1.852 km) from the Diu jetty, it also has a light house and a small chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Sea. The fortress creates a beautiful view whether seen from the jetty, from the villages of Ghoghla or from Diu proper, or from the Fort itself. Again, special light effects at night give it mesmerizing beauty.

He is credited with originating the concept of the structurally integrated casino resort complex in Las Vegas. High-rising Las Vegas Las Vegas transformed by high-rises Martin Stern Jr. designed the International Hotel, which later became the Las Vegas Hilton, and the first MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, two pivotal Martin Stern Jr. projects with entrepreneur Kirk Kerkorian in 1969 and 1973, set the pace for the transformation of Las Vegas from a low-rise sprawl of motels, clubs and parking lots into an extravagant high-rise metropolis. The Daily Telegraph (London) wrote of the first Stern and Kerkorian project in its September 2001 eulogy to Stern: \\"The International, whose tri-form 30-floor tower contained 1,519 rooms and became the most imitated building on the Las Vegas Strip, provided the model for the Bellagio, Treasure Island, Mirage and Mandalay Bay, among other hotels.\\" When it was completed, the International was the largest hotel in the world. The first MGM Grand, larger than the Empire State Building and in its turn the largest hotel in the world, burned in 1980 in what is considered the worst disaster in Nevada state history. As the Telegraph observed, this loss only seven years after the hotel was completed was devastating to Stern. The MGM Grand was nonetheless rebuilt within eight months and reopened. It was sold in 1985 and is now Bally's Las Vegas. Construction magnate Del Webb was another major client with whom Stern worked on many projects, including twenty years of elaborate stages of expansion of the Sahara Hotel and Casino between 1963 and 1983. Commissions The extensive Lied Library and Architecture Studies Library inventories of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Department of Special Collections document more than one hundred Martin Stern Jr. projects between 1951 and 1989, several of which ‚Äî including the near-legendary Xanadu envisioned in 1975 ‚Äî were never built. Dreaming the Skyline: Resort Architecture and the New Urban Space is an online collection from UNLV Libraries Digital Collections that includes several hundred images of Stern's work, including architectural plans and photographs. Nearly half of Martin Stern Jr.'s projects were in Nevada while another quarter were in California. The rest were in other states including Arizona, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Utah and in at least three other countries: Australia, Japan, and Slovenia, which was then part of Yugoslavia.

Specifically, it catalyses synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template. This is in contrast to typical DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which all organisms use to catalyze the transcription of RNA from a DNA template. RdRP is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of all RNA-containing viruses with no DNA stage, i.e. of the RNA viruses. Some eukaryotes also contain RdRP.  History  Viral RdRPs were discovered in the early 1960s from studies on mengovirus and polio virus when it was observed that these viruses were not sensitive to actinomycin D, a drug that inhibits cellular DNA-directed RNA synthesis. This lack of sensitivity suggested that there is a virus-specific enzyme that could copy RNA from an RNA template and not from a DNA template.  Distribution  RdRPs are highly conserved throughout viruses and is even related to telomerase, though the reason for this is an ongoing question as of 2009. The similarity has led to speculation that viral RdRps are ancestral to human telomerase. The most famous example of RdRP is that of the polio virus. The viral genome is composed of RNA, which enters the cell through receptor- mediated endocytosis. From there, the RNA is able to act as a template for complementary RNA synthesis, immediately. The complementary strand is then, itself, able to act as a template for the production of new viral genomes that are further packaged and released from the cell ready to infect more host cells. The advantage of this method of replication is that there is no DNA stage; replication is quick and easy. The disadvantage is that there is no 'back-up' DNA copy. Many RdRPs are associated tightly with membranes and are, therefore, difficult to study. The best-known RdRPs are polioviral 3Dpol, vesicular stomatitis virus L, and hepatitis C virus NS5B protein. Many eukaryotes also have RdRPs involved in RNA interference; these amplify microRNAs and small temporal RNAs and produce double-stranded RNA using small interfering RNAs as primers. In fact these same RdRPs that are used in the defense mechanisms can be usurped by RNA viruses for their benefit. Their evolutionary history has been reviewed.  Replication process  RdRP catalyses synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template. The RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of RNA synthesis begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a primer-independent (de novo), or a primer-dependent mechanism that utilizes a viral protein genome-linked (VPg) primer. The de novo initiation consists in the addition of a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to the 3'-OH of the first initiating NTP. During the following so-called elongation phase, this nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the complementary RNA product.  Structure  Overview of the flavivirus RdRp structure based on West Nile Virus (WNV) NS5Pol Viral/prokaryotic RNA-directed RNA polymerases, along with many single-subunit DNA-directed polymerases, employ a fold whose organization has been likened to the shape of a right hand with three subdomains termed fingers, palm, and thumb. Only the palm subdomain, composed of a four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet with two alpha helices, is well conserved among all of these enzymes. In RdRP, the palm subdomain comprises three well-conserved motifs (A, B, and C). Motif A (D-x(4,5)-D) and motif C (GDD) are spatially juxtaposed; the aspartic acid residues of these motifs are implied in the binding of Mg2+ and/or Mn2+. The asparagine residue of motif B is involved in selection of ribonucleoside triphosphates over dNTPs and, thus, determines whether RNA rather than DNA is synthesized. The domain organization and the 3D structure of the catalytic centre of a wide range of RdRPs, even those with a low overall sequence homology, are conserved. The catalytic centre is formed by several motifs containing a number of conserved amino acid residues. Eukaryotic RNA interference requires a cellular RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (cRdRP). Unlike the \\"hand\\" polymerases, they resemble simplified multi-subunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (DdRPs), specifically in the catalytic Œ≤/Œ≤' subunits, in that they use two sets of double-psi Œ≤-barrels in the active site. QDE1 () in Neurospora crassa, which forms a homodimer, is an example of such an enzyme. Bacteriophage homologs, including the homodimeric DdRp yonO, appear to be closer to cRdRPs than DdRPs are. In viruses Structure and evolution of RdRp in RNA viruses and their superfamilies There are 4 superfamilies of viruses that cover all RNA-containing viruses with no DNA stage: * Viruses containing positive-strand RNA or double-strand RNA, except retroviruses and Birnaviridae ** All positive-strand RNA eukaryotic viruses with no DNA stage ** All RNA-containing bacteriophages; there are two families of RNA-containing bacteriophages: Leviviridae (positive ssRNA phages) and Cystoviridae (dsRNA phages) ** dsRNA virus family Reoviridae, Totiviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae *Mononegavirales (negative-strand RNA viruses with non- segmented genomes; ) * Negative-strand RNA viruses with segmented genomes (), such as orthomyxoviruses and bunyaviruses * dsRNA virus family Birnaviridae () RNA transcription is similar to but not the same as DNA replication. Flaviviruses produce a polyprotein from the ssRNA genome. The polyprotein is cleaved to a number of products, one of which is NS5, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This RNA-directed RNA polymerase possesses a number of short regions and motifs homologous to other RNA-directed RNA polymerases. RNA replicase found in positive-strand ssRNA viruses are related to each other, forming three large superfamilies. Birnaviral RNA replicase is unique in that it lacks motif C (GDD) in the palm. Mononegaviral RdRP (PDB 5A22) has been automatically classified as similar to (+)-ssRNA RdRPs, specifically one from Pestivirus and one from Leviviridae.Structural Similarities for the Entities in PDB 5A22. Bunyaviral RdRP monomer (PDB 5AMQ) resembles the heterotrimeric complex of Orthomyxoviral (Influenza; PDB 4WSB) RdRP. Since it is a protein universal to RNA-containing viruses, RdRP is a useful marker for understanding their evolution. The overall structural evolution of viral RdRPs has been reviewed. =Recombination= When replicating its (+)ssRNA genome, the poliovirus RdRP is able to carry out recombination. Recombination appears to occur by a copy choice mechanism in which the RdRP switches (+)ssRNA templates during negative strand synthesis. Recombination frequency is determined in part by the fidelity of RdRP replication. RdRP variants with high replication fidelity show reduced recombination, and low fidelity RdRps exhibit increased recombination. Recombination by RdRP strand switching also occurs frequently during replication in the (+)ssRNA plant carmoviruses and tombusviruses. =Intragenic complementation= Sendai virus (family Paramyxoviridae) has a linear, single stranded, negative-sense, nonsegmented RNA genome. The viral RdRP consists of two virus-encoded subunits, a smaller one P and a larger one L. When different inactive RdRP mutants with defects throughout the length of the L subunit where tested in pairwise combinations, restoration of viral RNA synthesis was observed in some combinations.Smallwood S, Cevik B, Moyer SA. Intragenic complementation and oligomerization of the L subunit of the sendai virus RNA polymerase. Virology. 2002;304(2):235-245. doi:10.1006/viro.2002.1720 This positive L-L interaction is referred to as intragenic complementation and indicates that the L protein is an oligomer in the viral RNA polymerase complex.

Some orchids and strobilanthes in the upper hills. The area is rich in medicinal plants. Fauna The area is rich in wild mammals including Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, sloth bear, Ussuri dhole, Indian jackal, striped hyena, chausinga, sambar (largest Deer on earth) gaur, barking deer, ratel, flying squirrel, cheetal (type of deer), nilgai, wild boar, langur, rhesus monkey, and macaque. Also found here are 25 types of fishes and many varieties of butterflies. Crocodiles were re-introduced in a systematic manner in March 1990 and February 1991 in Siddu Kund in Gadga river near Dhakna and Hathikund in the Dolar river in the Gugamal National Park.

A revival of the art and craft of stained-glass window manufacture took place in early 19th-century Britain, beginning with an armorial window created by Thomas Willement in 1811‚Äì12. The revival led to stained glass windows becoming such a common and popular form of coloured pictorial representation that many thousands of people, most of whom would never commission or purchase a painting, contributed to the commission and purchase of stained-glass windows for their parish church. Within 50 years of the beginnings of commercial manufacture in the 1830s, British stained glass grew into an enormous and specialised industry, with important centres in Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham, Whitechapel in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Norwich and Dublin. The industry also flourished in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. By 1900 British windows had been installed in Copenhagen, Venice, Athens, Bangalore, Nagasaki, Manila and Wellington.e.g. St Alban's Copenhagen; Basilica of Ss Giovanni and Paolo, Venice; St Paul's Church, Athens; All Saints' Church, Bangalore; the original Nagasaki Cathedral; Manila Cathedral; St John's Presbyterian Church, Wellington. After the Great War from 1914 to 1918, stained glass design was to change radically. Painton Cowen, A guide to stained Glass in Britain; Sarah Brown, Stained Glass, an Illustrated history. Background The Bishop's Eye, (1320) at Lincoln Cathedral, is filled with salvaged fragments. Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, many churches, abbeys and cathedrals were built, initially in the Norman or Romanesque style, then in the increasingly elaborate and decorative Gothic style. In these churches the windows were generally either large or in multiples so that the light within the building was maximised. The windows were glazed, frequently with coloured glass held in place by strips of lead. Because flat glass could only be manufactured in small pieces, the method of glazing lent itself to patterning. The pictorial representation of biblical characters and narratives was a feature of Christian churches, often taking the form of murals. By the 12th century stained glass was well adapted to serve this purpose. For 500 years the art flourished and adapted to changing architectural styles.Lee, Seddon and Stephens, Stained Glass The vast majority of English glass was smashed by Puritans under Oliver Cromwell. Churches which retain a substantial amount of early glass are rare. Very few of England's large windows are intact. Those that contain a large amount of Medieval glass are usually reconstructed from salvaged fragments. The east, west and south transept windows of York Minster and the west and north Transept windows of Canterbury give an idea of the splendours that have been mostly lost.Lees, Seddon and Stephens, Stained Glass In Scotland, which never manufactured its own stained glass but bought from the south, they lost much of their glass not because it was smashed but because the monasteries were disbanded. These monasteries had monks with skills in repairing. When they went, windows gradually fell apart. Influences on the revival of stained glass The 14th-century glass of west window of York Minster has figures set beneath brightly coloured canopies, adopted by 19th-century designers such as Clayton and Bell =Historic= Medieval windows and drawings of them provided the source and inspiration for nearly all the earlier 19th-century designers. Canterbury Cathedral retains more ancient glass than any other English cathedral except York. Much of it appears to be imported from France and some is very early, dating from the 11th century. Much of the glass is in the style of Chartres Cathedral with deep blue featuring as the background colour in most windows. There are wide borders of stylised floral motifs and small pictorial panels of round, square or diaper shape. Other windows contain rows of apostles, saints and prophets. These windows, including the large west window have a predominance of red, pink, brown and green in the colours, with smaller areas of blue. Most of the glass in this remarkable window is older than the 15th-century stone tracery that contains it, the figure of Adam being part of a series of Ancestors of Christ that are among the oldest surviving panels in England. 13th-century glass at Canterbury Cathedral is full of lively narratives set in roundels surrounded by foliate scrolls, adopted by many 19th-century designers including Clutterbuck, William Wailes and Ward and Hughes York Minster also contains much of its original glass including important narrative windows of the Norman period, the famous \\"Five Sister\\" windows, the 14th-century west window and 15th-century east window. The \\"Five Sisters\\", although repaired countless times so that they now contain a spider's web of lead, still reveal their delicate pattern of simple geometric shapes enhanced by grisaille painting. They were the style of window which was most easily imitated by early 19th-century plumber-glaziers. The east and west windows of York are outstanding examples because in each case they are huge, intact, at their original location and by a known craftsman. The west window, designed in about 1340 by Master Robert, contains tiers of saints and stories of Christ and the Virgin Mary, each surmounted by a delicate Gothic canopy in white and yellow- stain, against a red background. The highly ornate tracery lights are filled with floral motifs. White glass stone borders surround each panel, making it appear to float in its frame. The east window of 1405 was glazed by John Thornton and is the largest intact medieval window in the world. It presents a narrative in sequential panels of the Creation, the Fall of Man, the Redemption, the Apocalypse, the Last Judgment and the Glory of God. York also has windows with small diaper-shaped quarries painted with little birds and other motifs which were much reproduced in the 19th century. Between them, the windows of York and Canterbury cathedrals provided the examples for different styles of windows‚Äîgeometric patterns, floral motifs and borders, narratives set in small panels, rows of figures, major thematic schemes. Scattered all over England, sometimes in remote churches, is similar evidence of the designs, motifs and techniques used in the past. Two churches, St Neot's in Cornwall and Fairford in Gloucestershire, are of particular interest. Fairford escaped the depredations of the Puritan era and, uniquely in England, retained its complete medieval cycle of glass. The theme is that of the east window of York, the Salvation of Mankind, but in this case the theme is spread across all the windows of the church, large and small. The west window, of seven lights, shows a single narrative incident, the Last Judgment. This scheme and these particular windows provided a rare source for the designers of narrative windows for parish churches.Painton Cowen, Sarah Brown; Lee, Seddon and Stephens Newstead Abbey as it was in the late 19th century =Philosophic= Romanticism In the 18th century there was a growing trend for philosophers, writers and painters to commune with nature. Nature was seen as all the more attractive if it contained signs of the grand aspirations, ideals and follies of humankind. Few things were considered more romantic than a medieval ruin which conjured up images of the traditional \\"romances\\" or idealistic sagas of the Middle Ages. England contained a great number of large Medieval ruins. These were chiefly castles destroyed by the Civil War in the 17th century and, even more significantly, vast abbey churches ruined at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. These ruined abbey churches suffered three long-term fates. Some were used as quarries for their building materials. The more remote abbeys were simply left to slowly decay. Those that were conveniently placed were awarded, with their associated lands, to favourites of King Henry VIII and his heirs. Thus it was that many of England's nobility grew up in homes that included within their structure part the Gothic remains of an ancient church or its associated monastic buildings. Some of these houses, such as the poet Byron's home, Newstead Abbey, contain reference to their origin within their name. In the 18th century the owning of such a pile became fashionable. Those of noble lineage who did not have a ruin or a battlemented tower or an interior with pointed arcades promptly built one. Among the earliest of these creations was the novelist Horace Walpole's refurbishing of his London villa, which gave its name to the pretty and somewhat superficial style of architectural decoration known as Strawberry Hill Gothick. The movement gained impetus- Sir Walter Scott built himself a Scottish Baronial mansion, Abbotsford; the castles of Warwick, Arundel and Windsor were refurbished by their owners. The movement was just as strong in Germany where \\"Mad\\" King Ludwig II of Bavaria indulged his medievalism by building the Disneyland icon of Neuschwanstein. All over Europe, those who could afford to do so began the restoration and refurbishment of Medieval buildings. The last great Romantic flourish was the building of Castle Drogo by Sir Edwin Lutyens between 1910 and 1930. St John's College Chapel, Cambridge, by George Gilbert Scott, photograph 1870 The Oxford Movement Begun in Oxford in 1833 by the theologian John Keble and supported by John Henry Newman, the Oxford Movement stressed the universality or \\"catholic\\" nature of the Christian Church and urged priests of the Church of England to reconsider their pre-Reformation traditions in both Doctrine and Liturgy. While reinforcing the concept of direct descent from the Apostles through the Church of Rome, the movement did not advocate a return to Roman Catholicism. In practice, however, several hundred Anglican priests, including Newman, became Roman Catholic. The long-term effects of the Oxford Movement were the rapid expansion of the Roman Catholic Church in Britain and the establishment of Anglo-Catholic liturgical styles in many Anglican churches. The emphasis on liturgical rites brought about an artistic revolution in church building and decoration. The Cambridge Camden Society Formed in 1839 as a society of Cambridge undergraduates with an interest in Medieval architecture, this group developed into a powerful movement for the recording, study preservation of England's ancient churches, the analysis and definition of architectural style and the dissemination of such information through its publications, chiefly a monthly journal The Ecclesiologist (1841‚Äì1869). The Cambridge Camden Society did much to bring about a revival of medieval styles in the design and appointments of 19th-century churches, as well as in the restoration of older ones. Their notions were often highly prescriptive, inflexible and intolerant of diversity within the church. They were insistent upon revival rather than originality. Self-portrait of John Ruskin, advocate of the Gothic Revival. John Ruskin John Ruskin (1819‚Äì1900), an art critic, wrote two books that were highly influential in Art Philosophy. In The Seven Lamps of Architecture (1849) and The Stones of Venice (1851‚Äì1853), he discussed the moral, social and religious implications of buildings, emphasising the desirability of an ethical approach to the practice of the arts. His thinking influenced the Pre-Raphaelites, whose artistic style Ruskin defended against criticism. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, 1849‚Äì1853 This group of artists, of whom Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt were the central figures, rejected the indulgent classicism, the materialism and the lack of social responsibility that they perceived in the artistic trends of mid-19th-century painting. They sought to recreate in their works the simple forms, bright colours, religious devotion and artistic anonymity of the period of art that preceded the rise of the great and famous individuals of the Renaissance period. They initially exhibited their works signed only with the initials PRB, Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Morris, designer, craftsman and teacher, portrait by George Frederic Watts, 1870 The Arts and Crafts Movement William Morris (1834‚Äì1896) was for a time a member of the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood and was influenced by their ideals and those of John Ruskin. As a precociously diverse designer, he saw the creation of arts in terms of social responsibility. He rejected, as Ruskin did, the mass- production of ornate and decorative wares of all sorts, such as those products of industry that were displayed in the 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition. Morris advocated a return to cottage crafts and the revival and promulgation of old skills. To this end he formed a business partnership with Marshall and Faulkner, employing Ford Madox Brown, another highly creative and dynamic artist and thus began what is termed \\"the Arts and Crafts Movement\\". Stained glass was just one of many products of their studio. Morris and Brown saw themselves as original artists working in the spirit of their antecedents. They did not reproduce earlier forms exactly, and because of disagreements with the philosophy of the Cambridge Camden Society, rarely created stained glass windows for ancient churches. William Morris's success as an entrepreneur was such that he was able to keep Rossetti, Burne-Jones and others in regular employment as designers. Through their teaching at the Working Men's College in London the group had enormous influence on many designers of all sorts. The Aesthetic Movement The Aesthetic Movement was a reaction against both the works of industry and the influential Socialist and Christian idealism of Morris and Ruskin who both saw art as directly linked to morality. Followers of the Aesthetic Movement, who included Burne-Jones and other stained glass designers such as Henry Holiday, propounded a philosophy of \\"Art for Art's sake\\". The style that evolved was sensuous and luxurious, linked with the rise of Art Nouveau. A. W. N. Pugin, architect and designer. =Architectural= Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin A. W. N. Pugin (1812‚Äì1852) was the son of the Neo-Gothic architect Augustus Charles Pugin and was a convert to Roman Catholicism in 1835. He built his first church in 1837. He was an enormously productive and meticulous church architect and designer of interiors. With the growth of Roman Catholicism in England, and the development of large industrial centres there was much scope for his talents. He worked with and employed other designers and was instrumental in encouraging the firm of John Hardman and Co. of Birmingham to turn their attention to the production of glass. Pugin's most renowned designs are the interiors, particularly the House of Lords, that he designed for the architect Sir Charles Barry, (1795‚Äì1860) at the Houses of Parliament in London. After the destruction by fire of the Houses of Parliament in 1834, Barry had won the commission for their rebuilding, the stipulation being that they should be in the Gothic style, as the most significant part of the Medieval complex, the Great Hall of Westminster, remained standing. The rebuilding, which took up the rest of Barry's life, included a vast array of arts and crafts of all kinds, not the least of which was stained glass windows, both pictorial and armorial. The knowledge, elegance and sophistication of Pugin's designs imbue and unite the interiors. As an ecclesiastical designer, his influence upon every medium is hard to overstate. George G. Scott, architect and restorer of cathedrals. Sir George Gilbert Scott As an architect Scott, (1811‚Äì1878), was persuaded by Pugin to turn his creativity towards Gothic Revival. Scott was an Anglican, his first significant commission being the design of the Martyrs' Memorial in Oxford, a powerful and highly visible architectural statement against the Oxford Movement. To Sir Gilbert fell the task of restoration of many of England's finest Medieval structures including Salisbury, Worcester, Chester, Ely and Durham Cathedrals. In the restorations, he was to employ and influence a great number of designers, including major stained glass firms. John Loughborough Pearson Pearson (1817‚Äì1897) was, like Scott, chiefly a restorer of churches. His major work was the creation of the new cathedral at Truro in Cornwall. Greek Thomson Alexander Thomson, nicknamed \\"Greek\\", (1817‚Äì1875), was one of the best known Scottish architects of his day and had a profound effect on later architects, particularly Charles Rennie MacIntosh. His building designs are curious and eclectic combinations of elements from the Classical, the Italian Renaissance, the Egyptian and the Exotic. He designed a number of churches with richly decorated interiors and employed several stained glass firms to furnish them with glass in the appropriate style. Armorial window with Willement's motto, from his home, Davington Priory =Manufacturing= Industrial Revolution With the growth of industry in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and in particular the growth of those industries associated with commercial glass production, metal trades, metallurgy and the associated technical advancements, the scene was set for the revival of stained glass manufacture and the development of that industry on an unprecedented scale. Thomas Willement, a plumber and glazier, produced his first armorial window in 1811, and is known as the father of the 19th- century stained glass industry. Because of the prevalence of leadlight windows, many glaziers had the required skills for making windows in geometric patterns using coloured glass for chapels and churches. Between 1820 and 1840 some 40 different glass painters appear in the London trades directories. At the time of the showcase of Victorian enterprise, the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851, stained glass manufacture had reached a point where 25 firms were able to display their works, including John Hardman of Birmingham, William Wailes of Newcastle, Ballantine and Allen of Edinburgh, Betton and Evans of Shrewsbury and William Holland of Warwick. Charles Winston Charles Winston was a 19th-century lawyer whose hobby was the study of Medieval glass. In 1847 he published an influential book on its styles and production, including a translation from Theophilus' On Diverse Arts, the foremost Medieval treatise on painting, stained glass and metalwork, written in the early 12th century. Winston's interest in the technicalities of coloured glass production led him to take shards of medieval glass to James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars for analyses and reproduction. Winston observed that windows of medieval glass appeared more luminous than those of early 19th-century production, and set his mind to discovering why this was the case. Winston observed that light streaming through a 19th-century window generally made a coloured pattern on the floor. This was rarely the case with medieval glass. He concluded that the reason that 19th-century glass lacked brilliance was because it was too flat and regular, allowing the light to pass through directly. He recommended a return to the manufacture of hand-made crown and cylinder glass with all their inherent refractive irregularities for the specific purpose of creating stained glass windows. Stylistic developments in 19th-century stained-glass windows The stylistic trends below did not necessarily follow each other consecutively. Rather, they overlapped and co-existed. Some stained glass studios were essentially a one- man show in which a single craftsmen designed and made windows of a particular style. Other firms were managed with considerable entrepreneurial skills, employing a number of designers. Some designers freelanced- their work can be seen in windows by a number of firms. Some firms changed with changing tastes and survived well into the 20th century. John Hardman & Co. is still in business. (For Glossary of Terms, see below.) Window with hand-painted quarries. =Armorial windows= These contain precisely painted shields and heraldic decoration utilising painterly skills that had remained in use during the 17th and 18th centuries. Thomas Willement was an armorial painter of windows. =Geometric patterns= These windows are simple and decorative, frequently utilising the skills of the provincial plumber/glazier. Many of these windows are among the earliest use of coloured glass but comparatively few have survived because later Victorians have replaced them with more elaborate pictorial windows. Some of these windows date from the 1820s. =Quarries= These windows are usually patterned with fleur de lys and other floral motifs that were suited to the shape of the diamond panes. They added a pleasant glowing ambience to an interior and in many churches in the early 19th century made up the entire glazing. They could be painted or stencilled with designs and are sometimes mould-cast or have impressed motifs. They were systematically replaced one by one when more elaborate windows were donated. These windows generally date from 1830 to 1860. Powell was a major supplier of impressed and stencilled quarries. Medieval foliage and Classical Figures. =Medieval foliate windows= From studying Medieval windows, particularly those at Canterbury Cathedral, many stained glass artists became adept at designing foliage and decorative borders that reproduce archaeological originals. There are windows of this type in which the foliate design is overlaid with banners bearing scriptural texts. In those windows that are set with figurative rondels, the style within them is often Classical (see below) but sometimes Medievalising and sometimes seeks to reproduce the original style so accurately that to they casual eye they have the appearance of ancient windows. Ancient windows in Canterbury Cathedral were removed in the 19th century and replaced with copies. There is a very fine Jesse Tree (the Ancestors of Christ) window of this nature at the eastern end. Two panels of the original have since been returned. =Classical figures= Although often striving for an exotic appearance, the figures in many early 19th-century windows are classicising in style. Set against a background of geometry, quarries or foliage, the small painted incidents within rondels and quatrefoils are nearly always conservatively academic in their appearance, with figures based on those in engravings of works by admired painters, Raphael, Titian, Andrea del Sarto and Perugino. Often in the case of windows with ornate foliage, the archaeologically correct surrounds are at variance with the style of the rondels which make no attempt to reproduce the medieval. William Wailes and Charles Edmund Clutterbuck were among the important firms. Gothic forms and pure colour. =Gothic Revival= Inspired by Ruskin, Pugin and the Gothic Revival, some artists sought to reproduce the style of figures that they saw in ancient glass, illuminated manuscripts and the few remaining English wall paintings of the Gothic period. A major source was provided by the Biblia Pauperum or so-called \\"Poor Man's Bible\\". The resulting figures are elongated, curvilinear and stylised rather than naturalistic. The drapery folds and scrolls are exaggerated and the gestures are expansive. The painted details are highly linear, crisply defined and elegant. The style lent itself to narrative, to pure colour and to highly decorative effects. While the figures may seem quaint or even na√Øve, the quality of design of many of these windows is often highly sophisticated and the detailing exquisite. The masters of Gothic revival were John Hardman and Co. of Birmingham and Clayton and Bell. Asymmetric design with bold colours =Arts and Crafts Movement= The group that surrounded and were influenced by William Morris passed through a series of trends, initially Pre-Raphaelite, which, although espousing the Medieval, was not Gothic Revival in the archaeological sense, being an esoteric mix of Medieval, Early Renaissance and deeply personal influences. The Arts and Crafts style lent itself to the depiction of solidly working- class apostles and virtues set against backgrounds of quarries that resemble glazed earthenware tiles. The botanically accurate and semi-realistic grapevines, sunflowers and other growing things were more prominent than Gothic canopies. Narratives that emphasised hard labour, human decency and charitable love were the themes that lent themselves to enthusiastic treatment by Morris and Ford Madox Brown. Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti were to become philosophic traitors to the Arts and Crafts Movement by their association with the Aesthetic Movement. Human interest and tertiary colours. =Naturalism= The 1870s was a time of rich ornamentation and eclecticism in the arts. The treatment of Gothic canopies which were a feature of so many windows began to change from the brightly coloured, two-dimensional, playful appearance of the 1850s and 60s to an appearance of having been carved from fine white limestone. Tudor and Renaissance architectural details made an appearance and were often used without reference to the nature of the real architecture that enclosed the window. The art of painting canopies in this manner was diligently maintained until after World War I. The Gothic style of figure painting began to give way to a more naturalistic style in which the figures seem more three-dimensional and portrait-like. An important source at this time was German wood engravings and etchings. These were available in a number of forms. Bibles and Bible picture books were available with several different series of such engravings. The works of Albrecht D√ºrer were much admired. One of the advantages of using engravings as a source was that the essentially linear techniques that were employed by the engraver to define forms could be easily interpreted in lead and the fine linear treatment of shadows was likewise easy for the stained glass artist to achieve using the monochrome paint technique. There were also windows imported into England at this time from the studios of Mayer of Munich which influenced English designers towards this style. In the late 19th century there is often a great richness in the colouration of the windows, marked by a use of tertiary colours including rich purple, salmon pink, olive green, claret red, saffron and brown. Flashed glass was skillfully employed to enhance deep folds in robes. With this interest in colour, many windows depict atmospheric effects. Sunsets, glowering storm clouds and blazing glories appear behind the figures. In line with the naturalistic drafting of the figures, there is a pictorial emphasis on depicting human interaction and response, often with detailed facial expressions and rather flamboyant gestures. Large scenes with large figures were popular. Among the major exponents were Lavers, Barraud and Westlake; and Heaton, Butler and Bayne. These trends continued, taking two basic directions until World War I. The notable exceptions to the general trend were a large number of the windows made by Clayton and Bell who produced a diverse range of styles and continued to supply cheerfully coloured Gothic- style windows with a proliferation of bright red and yellow to catch the morning sun in church chancels. Elegant figures in subdued colours. =Refinement= A somewhat more reserved style emerged in which the vibrant colouration is toned down in favour of backgrounds that are basically white, discreetly enhanced with yellow-stain. The clothing of the figures is often of the darker shades, royal blue, wine red and dark green and is lined or bordered with intricately decorated yellow-stained glass. The painting of canopies and draperies was taken to a new height. The monochrome painting of faces is intensely detailed. The style lent itself to the depiction of saints and prophets, bishops and admirals, and Christ (or Queen Victoria) enthroned. The most influential firm in this style was Burlison and Grylls. There are many windows by Charles Eamer Kempe of this type. Individual. Much use of opalescent glass. Aestheticism The Aesthetic Movement included Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Burne-Jones, the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and writer Oscar Wilde. They propounded \\"Art for Art's sake\\", claiming that Beauty was an end in itself and that the creation of art should not be bound to any social or moral ideals. The Aesthetic artists were primarily concerned with the creation of that which was beautiful. Because of this, windows created by these artists are often stylistically diverse from each other and from other styles, yet are highly recognisable as the work of a particular designer, rather than of a particular workshop. These windows rarely pay homage to Medieval origins. They are closely associated with Art Nouveau. The designs are often sinuous, luscious and richly textured, making highly creative use of flashed glass and repetitive forms. Drifting clouds, sweeping draperies and angel's wings lent themselves to the art of the Aesthetes. The idiosyncrasies of Burne-Jones‚Äô style make his windows particularly easy to recognise. While Charles Eamer Kempe made many windows that were traditional and \\"safe\\", he designed others that are clearly aesthetic. Christopher Whall and, in America, Tiffany were Aesthetic designers. Luxurious drapery, pearl borders. =Opulence= In the last days of the Empire, the technical proficiency and artistic excesses of the traditional stained glass artists reached their height. The great windows of this period demonstrate a mastery over figure drawing and stained glass painting. The artists had developed ways of achieving every possible textural effect through the expert application of ground-glass paint and yellow-stain:- babies‚Äô ringlets, old men's beards, silk brocade, dove's feather, ripe grapes, gold braid, glowing pearls and greasy sheep's wool could all be painted to realistic perfection by any number of studios. Many windows of the Edwardian period are the most opulent creations of the stained glass industry. The youthful Virgin of the Annunciation, Peter the fisherman, John the itinerant preacher and Joseph the carpenter are all depicted in robes of the most sumptuous nature, lined with cloth of gold and lavishly decorated at the edges with rubies and pearls. In the years immediately following World War I, many of these windows were created by the more conservative studios as memorials to fallen soldiers. Hence there are countless two-light windows of St George and St Michael and even more lancets of the Good Shepherd gathering his lost sheep to the fold. These are the last product of the second Golden Age of stained glass window production.The example illustrated commemorates a 21-year-old soldier who died in the Great War. His brothers, who also died aged 17 and 19, are commemorated in the adjacent window of Christ with the Children. =Gallery= File:Chapel glass ca1900 b.jpgStencilled quarries of cathedral glass, c. 1900 File:St Mildred, Tenterden, Kent - Window - geograph.org.uk - 324270.jpgLavers and Barraud, 1864, St Mildred, Tenterden File:Winchester cathedral 026 brighter.JPGBurne-Jones window Winchester Cathedral File:Window, Chester Cathedral detail of east window Heaton Butler & Bayne.JPGHeaton Butler and Bayne at Chester Cathedral Common types of 19th-century windows based on content (For Glossary of terms', see below.

Born in K≈çchi Prefecture, Japan; in his youth, he was a sumo wrestler. He was captain of the sumo club at Kobe Business School (now Kobe University) and won the All-Kansai Student Sumo Championship. He later became the director of General Affairs at the Asahi News in Osaka. He was advised to learn the technique of Daito-ryu aiki- jujutsu for self-defense and was introduced to Ueshiba, becoming one of his early prewar students. Later (in 1936) he studied directly under Takeda when the latter came teaching at the Asahi News dojo. He received the Kyoju Dairi (teaching certification) a year later and was awarded the Menkyo kaiden rank in 1939, directly from Takeda. He later became one of the most prominent teachers of Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu. In 1959, he established the Kansai Aikido Club to teach the techniques of Ueshiba and Takeda. Hisa is also remembered for compiling a catalogue of techniques from photographs taken at the Asahi News dojo featuring both Ueshiba and Takeda.

Written by William F. Zorzi from a story by Ed Burns & William F. Zorzi, and directed by Anthony Hemingway, it originally aired on October 29, 2006. Plot summary =Omar= Omar Little is attacked in prison, and stabs his assailant as a warning to the others who might try to kill him. Butchie's men tell Omar that the bounty on his head was placed by Marlo Stanfield. Omar gets a cell phone when he asks if they can help him make a call. He tells his bodyguards that he is phoning the police because he is owed a favor. =Homicide= Detectives Ed Norris and Kima Greggs bring in a jailhouse informant who has offered them information on the Braddock murder case. Sergeant Jay Landsman observes the informant's arrival; when he remarks on their progress, Greggs angrily reminds him that their investigation has been slowed by political interference. Lester Freamon makes miniature furniture at his desk and Landsman is impressed with the money he makes from his hobby. Later, Freamon discusses the case with Greggs and convinces her to interview their main suspect Wardell ‚Äî the man that Braddock was set to witness against. Back at headquarters, Bunk tries to convince Detectives Crutchfield and Vernon Holley to reopen Omar's case based on his claims of innocence. Crutchfield refuses to entertain the possibility that Omar is innocent and is angry that Bunk is interfering. Maurice Levy is Anthony Wardell's attorney. He allows his client to undergo the polygraph, knowing that it is a sign of desperation from the investigators. When the polygraph technician tells Greggs outside the room that he could make it go either way, she is disgusted. Her partner explains that it is an open secret that the polygraph is unreliable and is used as an interrogation and coercion tool by the police. On returning to the room, Levy explains his rationale behind subjecting Wardell to the polygraph: his client is innocent. Wardell tells Greggs that he would not have killed Braddock because he is a relative. After the polygraph test, Bunk approaches Ilene Nathan with Omar's card. She is uninterested, saying that she offered help on a light felony at most. Bunk convinces her to move him to a safer facility, and she tells Bunk she now considers the debt paid. Greggs reviews the Braddock case and picks out a detail: no one in the canvas noticed the gunshot. This prompts her to revisit the scene of the shooting, where she identifies a ricochet that she traces back down the alley to other signs of gunfire, eventually finding broken bottles outside a backyard. She finds a bullet lodged in a discarded chest of drawers and finally some potatoes that have been shot through in the back yard. Greggs draws her weapon and enters the house. Greggs later tells Norris she has solved the case and shows him the murder weapon pulled out of the house. Apparently, Braddock was killed by a stray bullet while someone was attempting target practice, using the potatoes as suppressors. =Politics= Tommy Carcetti meets with a former mayor, Tony, for advice on beginning his term. Tony tells him a story of being forced to \\"eat shit\\" from the various constituent interests of the city, a pattern that continued throughout his term and eventually led him to forgo standing for re-election. Carcetti and Norman Wilson have an amicable meeting with Mayor Clarence Royce and his Chief of Staff Coleman Parker. They discuss the ins and outs of their campaigns. Carcetti mentions that Theresa D'Agostino has a new role with the DCCC. Carcetti claims the last-second move with the slumlord pamphlets was ingenious; however, Royce and Parker laughingly point out that the pamphlets were not officially endorsed by anyone on Royce's campaign team. Rhonda Pearlman meets with the new state's attorney, Rupert Bond. Thinking she will likely be replaced by an African American attorney, she is surprised when he offers her the Violent Crimes Unit post. Bond states that he is impressed with her record and courage and wants the right prosecutors to help run the States' Attorney for Baltimore office. The post has opened as he is promoting Ilene Nathan to second deputy state's attorney. From the looks of it, Bond appears more interested in criminal prosecutions than his predecessor, Steven Demper, who was most interested in his elected position ‚Äî often dismissing cases to maintain a favorable conviction rate. Western District commander Cedric Daniels attends a COMSTAT meeting chaired by commissioner Ervin Burrell and his deputy William Rawls. Daniels tells his commanders that the homicide rate has dropped while other felony rates have risen, but refuses to take credit. Carcetti arrives to observe the meeting and opts to sit next to Rawls rather than Burrell, to the latter's dismay. Daniels tells them of his strategy of putting two-man cars on the worst drug corners while devoting his resources as much as possible to pursuing good felony cases. Burrell becomes angered when Daniels claims that he refuses to force street level arrests. He is further affronted when Daniels tells them that many of his officers are insufficiently trained to pursue quality cases. Carcetti meets with Wilson, State Delegate Watkins and Gerry to discuss their first move in office. Carcetti and Watkins agree Ervin Burrell should be replaced as Commissioner. but Watkins and Wilson point out the negative optics of a white mayor firing an African American Police Commissioner. Carcetti notes that the pay, location, and talent pool is not sufficient to replace Burrell with another African American and concludes that he is stuck with Burrell. Carcetti takes a ride along with Southern District officers. Major Cantrell is surprised when he declines to travel with shift lieutenant Grayson, but impressed that Carcetti is interested in understanding the day-to-day of the district. Grayson assigns him to officers Macfarlane and Ginter. They are called to a shooting where they view Daniels as the duty officer. Carcetti is impressed with Daniels' professionalism and is told that Daniels is \\"not as bad as some\\" by the Southern District officers. =Marlo= Marlo Stanfield tells Proposition Joe of his failed efforts to flush out whoever has been investigating him. Joe recommends that Marlo steal the surveillance camera that he knows has been set up on him: federal agents have enough funding to let the camera go if they had set it up, but local police will come looking for it. =Major Case Unit= Sergeant Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk and Detective Leander Sydnor realise that the surveillance camera has been stolen. Herc worries that Lieutenant Charlie Marimow will use the theft to end his career. Ellis Carver remembers Randy and his plan to phone Bunk about it. He offers Herc a chance to talk to Randy before he passes him on. Carver phones Bunk and leaves a message with Crutchfield who, angry at Bunk for interfering in Omar's murder case, promptly throws it away. Carver later presents Randy to Herc and Sydnor and urges them to look after him. Herc takes Randy to an interview room and buys him food. Despite Carver telling him that Randy knows about a murder, Herc's first question is about the security camera. Randy recounts the events leading up to Lex's murder. He gives them Little Kevin's name and tells them that Chris and Snoop killed Lex. Herc becomes frustrated as he realizes that Randy's information is second-hand and tries to intimidate him into saying he was present when Lex was killed. Sydnor is dismayed at Herc's aggressive approach. Herc gives up and returns Randy home. Randy asks them to drop him off down the block so he isn't seen with the police. Afterward Herc complains to Sydnor that Carver was mistaken when he said Randy could give them a murder. He decides to attack Marlo head-on to retrieve the camera. =Cutty= Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise finally tracks his absentee welterweight Spider down and finds him selling drugs on a corner with Jamal. Spider initially tries to walk away, but becomes confrontational when Cutty tries to apologize for sleeping with Spider's mother. Later, Cutty apologizes to his budding boxers for his recent womanizing and the effect it may have on them. =School= Michael Lee and Karim Williams play poker during their lunch break. Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski notices Karim playing with money and tells the boys that he doesn't mind them eating in his classroom as long as they don't gamble. Michael wins the hand and Prez tells Karim about betting based on the odds. Michael is intrigued and asks for more information. Realizing that the children are interested, Prez visits Donnelly to ask if the school has any board games. She directs him to their book storage room and gives him the key along with a firm reminder to stay on curriculum. Prez takes Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems with him to the store room and raids the board game boxes for dice. Prez makes several other discoveries, including brand new math text books and unopened computers. After school Michael visits Namond Brice, who has set himself up as a crew chief selling drugs at his mother's urging. Namond's workers include Donut and Kenard. Michael notices members of a rival drug crew who are unhappy with Namond moving in on their territory, but Namond does not believe they will be a problem. The rival crew chief tells his dealers, who include Sherrod and Shaun Williams, to follow Namond when he leaves and give him a beating. They follow Namond to Cutty's gym, taking cocaine to get them ready for the task. Sherrod approaches Namond as he leaves the gym and warns him to stay away from their spot. They begin to fight before Cutty breaks them up. Cutty angrily questions Namond about what happened and then sends him home. He asks Michael what Namond has gotten into, but Michael tells him it is not either of their business. Assistant Principal Marcia Donnelly visits Prez's math class to update him about a rape allegation made by a female student, Tiff. She has admitted that she had consensual sex with two boys, thus clearing them of any law-breaking and allowing Randy Wagstaff to return to school after being suspended for acting as a lookout for the others. When Donnelly leaves Prez begins to teach; he has set up a computer for a special class project and has the new textbooks for his students. Namond attends his separate class, part of a University of Maryland-funded investigation targeting prevention of repeat violent offender behavior at the school level. Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin oversees the class with Dr. David Parenti. Two specialist teachers try to control the children. One girl, Chandra, will not stop brushing her hair, so she is removed from the class. When she returns, Namond repeatedly acts out and tries to get himself suspended. The class has a no-suspension policy and he is simply removed from the class temporarily instead. Later, Namond convenes with Donut, Byron and Kenard on a new corner. He tells them they are starting late because his plan to get out of school early failed. Namond puts Byron in charge of the stash. Kenard complains about their change in location. Cutty visits the school to meet with Donnelly about her program to secure funding by having him round up truant children for a day in September and October. He hoped to be doing something more meaningful and decides to quit. He meets with his old flame Grace Sampson on his way out and learns that she moved to Edward Tilghman. He wishes her well before leaving. Namond is removed from class again and refuses to talk to Colvin or the specialist teacher, instead swearing every time he is spoken to. Back in class, Albert acts out after being asked to read a book. Colvin is dismayed at the difficulty of the task they have taken on, while Parenti is fascinated by the clinical aspects of the behavior exhibited. A different picture unfolds in Prez's math class. The children are enjoying his lesson plan of playing dice games to learn probability. Randy has missed earlier lessons so his bets are less informed than Michael's, but he learns quickly when he loses a round. Sampson observes the lesson and Prez explains his thinking: trick them into thinking they aren't learning and they do. =Bubbles= Bubbles finds himself missing Sherrod and visits Edward Tilghman Middle School hoping to find Sherrod. He talks to Donnelly, still posing as Sherrod's uncle. Donnelly tells him that Sherrod is on the truant list. Bubbles bumps into Prez on his way out and jokes that he will keep his undercover identity secret. Bubbles continues his search for Sherrod as he plies his mobile depot trade. He has added unlicensed DVDs to his stock. He is accosted by the same drug addict that robbed him before; the man takes his money and his drugs as well as stealing from his cart. Bubbles waves down a passing squad car for assistance. The officer, Eddie Walker, notices Bubbles' DVDs and threatens him with fines for copyright infringement as well as selling on the street without a license, but instead takes some of the DVDs and Bubbles' merchandise and drives off as Bubbles accuses him of stealing. Bubbles is robbed by the same man a third time shortly afterwards and takes another beating. Bubbles finally tracks Sherrod down to the corner where he is working and asks him to come home. He notices that Sherrod has begun using drugs. When Bubbles gets home, Sherrod has not come back. Production This episode marks the first time Bubbles's real name is used when Marcia Donnelly calls him \\"Mr. Cousins\\". This is the second time the Italian film L'ultimo bacio appears on the show, when a bootleg DVD is taken by Officer Walker it appears to be a copy of this film. The first appearance was in the third season, in the episode \\"All Due Respect\\". In the episode's opening scene, Omar is shown reading Ghettoheat by Hickson. In the second scene, over the radio at Bubbles', a columnist can be heard describing his job as reminiscent to the one of David Simon. =Title reference= The reference is from the proverb \\"Do unto others as you would have done to yourself\\". This ties into the golden rule Bunk mentions to Omar, who is facing retribution from many of his former victims in prison. It also references Bunk's interference in Holley's and Crutchfield's homicide case, after which Crutchfield threatens to interfere with the next case Bunk catches. =Epigraph= Bunk says this to Omar during their interrogation. =Credits= Starring cast Although credited Dominic West does not appear in this episode.

It was directed by Michael Anderson and written by Emeric Pressburger, under the pseudonym \\"Richard Imrie\\", Derry Quinn and Ray Rigby from a story from Duilio Coletti and Vittoriano Petrilli. It was filmed at MGM-British Studios.\\"Film review:Operation Crossbow.\\" Variety, 7 April 1965, p. 6. The film is a highly fictionalised account of the real-life Operation Crossbow, made with a large cast of popular film stars of the time. It does touch on the main aspects of the operation, which embraced all tactics used to thwart the German long-range weapons programme in the last years of World War II. The scenes alternate between Nazi Germany‚Äôs development of the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket, and the efforts of British Intelligence and its agents to defend against the threats. All characters speak in the appropriate language, with English subtitles for those speaking German or Dutch. Plot In 1943, Nazi Germany is developing terror weapons, the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket. Technical problems with the V-1 lead them to create a manned version to investigate them, but the test pilots die flying it. Eventually, Aviator Hanna Reitsch (Barbara R√ºtting) successfully flies the prototype, discovering the problem (mechanical shifting of the rocket's weight and change of speed) and determining a solution. Winston Churchill (Patrick Wymark) is concerned about a rumoured flying bomb and orders Duncan Sandys (Richard Johnson) his son-in-law and a minister, to investigate. Sandys is convinced by intelligence and photo-reconnaissance reports that they exist, but sceptical scientific advisor Professor Lindemann (Trevor Howard) dismisses the reports. (He is proved wrong when V-1s start falling on London a year later.) Bomber Command launches a raid on Peenem√ºnde on 17/18 August 1943 to destroy the complex producing them. The Germans move production underground in Southern Germany and progress development of the more deadly V-2. The head of British intelligence (John Mills) learns that engineers are being recruited across occupied Europe for the new weapon and decides to infiltrate the factory. He finds three volunteers, American, Dutch and British, all experienced engineers with fluent German and Dutch. They are hastily trained and sent to Germany. Amongst the volunteers interviewed but not selected is a British officer named Bamford (Anthony Quayle), who is a German undercover agent. After the agents are parachuted into occupied Europe, British Intelligence learns that one, Robert Henshaw (Tom Courtenay), has been given the identity of a Dutch sailor wanted for murder. He is arrested but agrees to becoming an engineer to act as an informer for the Germans. However, he is recognised by Bamford, who has returned to Germany as a security officer. Refusing to reveal his mission, he is tortured by the Gestapo and then shot after refusing to co-operate. A further complication occurs when Nora (Sophia Loren), the wife of the man whom USAAF Lieutenant John Curtis (George Peppard) is impersonating, visits her husband to obtain child custody. Curtis and Phil Bradley (Jeremy Kemp) infiltrate the factory. Bradley is assigned as a porter/cleaner while his papers are checked, but Curtis joins the heart of the project, assigned to fix the vibration delaying the V-2's development. V-1 flying bombs are shown destroying London housing, while others are destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. Then the more devastating V-2 assault begins. Launched from undetectable mobile platforms, the only way to fight them is to destroy the factory. The agents learn that the Royal Air Force is mounting a nighttime bombing raid, but the protective launch doors covering the ready-to-launch large A9/A10 \\"New York Rocket\\", must be opened to expose the plant and provide a visible target. Bradley takes on the task of discovering which switch in the powerhouse opens the doors. Meanwhile, Bamford arrives and reviews the photos of the important staff, searching for a familiar face. He recognized no one, and orders that all employee records be checked. This includes receiving photos by Telex. The face of the man Curtis is impersonating appears and Bamford realizes he is a spy. He sounds the alarm just as the agents are heading for the powerhouse. Bradley is captured, but Curtis‚Äîwho does not know which switch to pull‚Äî shoots his way inside and seals himself in, holding staff hostage. Overhead, bombers are searching for a sign. Bamford demands Curtis surrenders, using Bradley as a bargaining chip but, as the air raid siren sounds, Bradley lunges for the microphone and tells Curtis which switch to pull; he is then shot by Bamford. The powerhouse workers attack Curtis, but he shoots them. One shoots Curtis as he pulls the lever opening the launch door. The Germans try to launch the missile but, as it lifts off, bombs hit, obliterating the facility. Churchill congratulates Sandys, who observes that some of the agents will never be known. Churchill adds that, without the RAF‚Äôs courageous raid on Peenem√ºnde, London would have been devastated. He makes Sandys Minister of Works and speaks of rebuilding.

Sophia Loren and George Peppard were cast early on. To help the box office, Sophia Loren appears, courtesy of her husband and producer of the film Carlo Ponti, in a cameo role. Despite getting lead billing, she has only a modest role in the hotel sequence. She plays the Italian wife of engineer Erik van Ostamgen, a dead man whose identity has been appropriated by Curtis, Peppard's character. He provides her with a travel document, but she is killed to maintain secrecy. Peppard was chosen for his role because of contract difficulties. MGM held his contract and insisted on a movie before he gained his release and cast him in this film.Atkins, David. User review: \\"George Peppard's Great War Movie.\\" Turner Classic Movies, 8 May 2008. He signed a new agreement with MGM for which Crossbow was the first ‚Äì one a year for three years. Filming started July 1964. Said Peppard, \\"Mikey Anderson is one of those gifted directors who let you play it your own way and only when you see your own rushes do you realise you've been doing it his way all along.\\" Said Anderson during filming: > I like working in the extremes of either sheer fantasy - that's what made > Around the World in 80 Days such a joy - or sheer reality. Crossbow falls > into this second class and has given me a wonderful opportunity to dig into > the past and into the truth. I researched Crossbow like an FBI man on a > murder case, flying to the States, France, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and > Germany because the story concentrates just as much on the Nazis' efforts to > get their V rockets into the air as on the Allies' efforts to bring them > down. This isn't going to be one of those films where all the German > soldiers are square-headed idiots repeating 'Donner und Blitzen'. The > Crossbow mission was a vital mission and had it not come off we might well > have all been doing the goosestep now. The sets were the largest ever built at MGM British studios. Stages 6 and 7 were combined into one large set of 30,000 square feet. Some scenes of the bombing of the factory at the end of the film were later used in Battlestar Galactica to show the inside of the spacecraft burning. The scenes are obvious because a railway oil tank wagon is clearly visible. Ponti and the production company worried that the authentic name chosen for the film was confusing and led to a poor initial showing. This reappraisal led to new names, Code Name: Operation Crossbow and The Great Spy Mission, the name chosen for a re-release in North America. The film was also known as Operazione Crossbow in Italy.Erickson, Hal. \\"Synopsis: Operation Crossbow.\\" AllRovi. Retrieved: 21 September 2011. Realistic props and detailed sets added to the look of authenticity in recreating the German secret weapons projects. The now-defunct St. Pancras power station in London was used as a filming location for the power house scenes. The Norfolk town of Kings Lynn was also used as a filming location. =Dialogue= An unusual aspect of Operation Crossbow is that all the German characters, and the disguised Allied characters in their roles, speak (subtitled) German instead of accented English. The same was true of the 1962 film The Longest Day. According to Turner Classic Movies' commentary,Ben Mankiewicz, TCM, commentary after Operation Crossbow, 6:00‚Äì8:00pm, September 1, 2018 actor Paul Henreid argued the German would not work well, and that they should use English with a heavy German accent. Director Michael Anderson insisted on staying with the idea. However, it did not come across well, apparently leading to many of Henreid's scenes being cut. =Historical accuracy= Some real people were portrayed quite accurately in the film: * Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell, universally known as \\"Prof\\", served as the British government's leading scientific adviser in the Second World War, when Churchill became Prime Minister.Fort 2004, p. 237. * Duncan Sandys was the son-in-law of Winston Churchill. He was wounded in action in Norway in 1941, giving him a permanent limp, as he is portrayed in the film. Sandys was Chairman of a War Cabinet Committee for defence against German flying bombs and rockets.King and Kutta 2003, pp. 176, 184. (As Minister of Defence in 1957 he produced the 1957 Defence White Paper, that proposed a radical shift in the Royal Air Force by ending the use of fighter aircraft in favour of missile technology.) * Hanna Reitsch was a German aviator and well- known test pilot.Piszkiewicz 1987, p. 86. * Constance Babington Smith was a British WAAF officer who interpreted aerial photographs of Peenem√ºnde.Kreis, John F. et al.

The New York Times designated Operation Crossbow a Critic's Pick by film reviewer Bosley Crowther, who noted the film was a complex mix of fiction and fact that was a \\"grandly engrossing and exciting melodrama of wartime espionage, done with stunning documentary touches in a tight, tense, heroic story line.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Review: Operation Crossbow (1965).\\" The New York Times, 2 April 1965.Variety reviewers had a similar evaluation, praising the \\"suspenseful war melodrama\\" that boasted ambitious production values but also commented that \\"what the Carlo Ponti production lacks primarily is a cohesive story line.\\" A later review by Alun Evans reinforces the more prevalent view that a \\"starry cast add to the attractive vista but a tighter script would have been appreciated.\\"Evans 2000, p. 145.

Ground was broken to build the mall in 1976. It was completed in 1978, making it the youngest of the four self-branded \\"fashion centres\\" operated by Cadillac Fairview. Les Promenades St-Bruno is the largest mall in the Mont√©r√©gie and part of its consumer base come from cities as far as Saint-Hyacinthe and Sorel-Tracy. The anchor tenants are The Bay and Simons. The Bay is the only one left among the five initial anchors, although it moved into the space that was vacated by Simpsons in 1989, with its original location being converted into a mall expansion in 1991. Aside from The Bay, the 1978 anchors were Simpsons, Miracle Mart, Steinberg's and Eaton's. History A Steinberg's supermarket was there between 1978 and 1992, around . Steinberg's, through Ivanhoe, had owned 25% of the mall and also operated a Miracle Mart/M store side by side to the supermarket.http://collections.banq.qc.ca/retrieve/5852367 Both businesses closed in 1992. The following year, Zellers took over all of the space used by Steinberg's and the vast majority of the M store. Zellers left the mall in 2012 and American giant retailer Target occupied its space from 2013 to 2015. After fours years of unoccupancy, the former Target location is being transformed in 2019 to welcome a grocery store as well as a public market and a relocated SAQ. This new food-oriented section is expected to be operational in the fall of 2020. Hudson's Bay Company closed its Simpsons location at Promenades St-Bruno in early March 1989. The existing The Bay store relocated into Simpsons' vacant space on June 22, 1989. The Bay's original location stayed vacant for over a year. Through The Bay's former anchor space, a new mall wing was created with 57 boutiques and a Sears, which opened during the spring of 1991. The new section with the boutiques inaugurated on March 20, 1991, while Sears itself opened on April 3. This increased the size of the mall to nearly . The Sears at Promenades Saint-Bruno was notable for being the first to dedicate 60% of its space for fashion apparels and the other 40% for housewares and durable goods; taking an opposite proportion of the chain's other stores at the time. Sears closed on January 14, 2018. The space that Sears occupied was dismantled to welcome a relocating Sports Experts, Winners, Imaginaire, with the possibility to add in the future three restaurants. On May 1, 2019, Sports Expers/Atmosphere left its previous location above Simons to relocate on the second floor of the former Sears store. Winners opened on September 10, 2019 in the first floor of Sears. Imaginaire, a retail chain from Quebec City, opened its first Greater Montreal location during the fall of 2019, using 15,000 square feet of the former Sears. Former Sears store from 1991 to 2018 (now the site of Winners, Sports Experts and Imaginaire). During the 1990s, big box stores arrived around the mall, which continued well into the 2000s. While some of these stores (e.g., Best Buy, Old Navy) are tenants of Promenades St-Bruno, the majority of them have no relation to the mall. Simons picked the first floor of former Eaton's on August 9, 2001. Sport Experts/Atmosphere and five boutiques took over the second floor of Eaton's. Simons is slated to double its size in 2021 by expanding on the second floor formerly occupied by Sports Experts which relocated in 2019 to Sears' former location. The renovated Simons will be modelled after the chain's existing store at Galeries d'Anjou which has two floors. The exterior of Simons at Promenades Saint-Bruno, whose facade has always been two-story high since the store's inauguration in 2001, is expected to stay the same after the expansion. Les Promenades St-Bruno was the first shopping centre in Canada to house at the same time the three traditional upscale department stores: Simpsons, The Bay and Eaton's. It is also one of the first shopping centres in Quebec with a food court, having been part of the mall since its inauguration in 1978. Although now wholly owned by Cadillac Fairview, Les Promenades Saint- Bruno was originally the joint property at 51% of the aforementioned company, 24.5% of Ivanhoe Corporation and 24.5% of Eaton's. A mid-air collision occurred above the mall on March 17, 2017, with the wreckage of both planes landing on the parking lot of the mall.

The NZAC is the national climbing organisation in New Zealand and is a member of the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme. It has over 4000 members who are spread across twelve sections, eleven in New Zealand and one in Australia, plus members in other countries. It runs a national office based in Christchurch. History The NZAC was founded on 28 July 1891 at Warner's Commercial Hotel in Christchurch. Leonard Harper (Christchurch) was voted as the inaugural chairman in absentia; he had left for England on 25 July (and while away, it was discovered that he had embezzled money; hence he did not return). Frederick Hutton (Christchurch), Edward Sealy (Timaru), Malcolm Ross (Dunedin), and John Holland Baker (Wellington) were the inaugural vice- presidents. Arthur Paul Harper, Leonard Hutton's son, was the inaugural secretary and treasurer. Description The club actively promotes climbing in New Zealand and overseas. It publishes guidebooks to New Zealand mountains and to selected rock climbing areas, and also makes this information accessible online. It publishes a quarterly magazine The Climber (which is also online), and the annual New Zealand Alpine Journal. NZAC owns 17 lodges and huts that are available for use by club members and other climbers. Most sections provide instruction courses for beginning climbers and the club also provides instruction for intermediate and advanced skills. NZAC sponsors the annual national bouldering series held during the summer at four locations, as well as other local and national competitive climbing events. The visibility of mountaineering in New Zealand was boosted by the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest by Sir Edmund HillaryHillary, Edmund, High Adventure: The True Story of the First Ascent of Everest and Tenzing Norgay. Hillary is amongst the best known and most revered New Zealanders and was a life member of the NZAC. Other NZAC members have completed first ascents in many mountain areas, including in the Himalayas, Antarctica and the Andes.Colin Monteath, Hall and Ball: Kiwi mountaineers, Hedgehog HousePhilip Temple, The world at their feet, Whitcombe and Tombs New Zealand is a very mountainous country, and mountaineering has long been popular in New Zealand.Graeme Dingle, Dingle: Discovering the sense in adventure, Craig Potton PublishingNorman Hardie, On my own two feet, Canterbury University Press The mountaineering opportunities focus particularly on the Southern Alps which run the length of the South Island, but also include other ranges such as the Kaikouras, Arrowsmiths and the North Island volcanoes Mount Taranaki and Mounts Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe and Tongariro. Rock climbing attracts many participants in New Zealand and the varied topography and rock types provide opportunities for rock climbing within some cities such as Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin, and within an hours drive of most cities in New Zealand. Ice climbing, bouldering, sport climbing and trad climbing are all well established.

Plot summary Government officials of the Terrestrial Federation negotiate to sell the planet Jupiter to an energy-based alien race. The beings refuse to reveal their plans for its use and whether or not they are at war with other similar beings. Eventually, the aliens reveal that they wish to suspend letters in Jupiter's atmosphere as an advertising slogan (i.e. Jupiter is to be used as an advertising billboard), to be seen by passing spacecraft.

The player controls an upgradable fighter that must battle its way through thousands of enemy ships before it confronts the final boss, Emperor Hades. There are fifteen levels. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot Enemies are face-like ships or bug-like ships that materialise at certain points in the game. Upon appearance they immediately seek out the player's ship and collide with it unless evasive action is taken. Also, every one or two levels or so, 'mother ship' bosses are encountered that take a considerable amount of bullet dodging and incisive shots to destroy. There are two sound options while playing the game; either sound effects or the musical soundtrack by Ben Daglish. The latter is the default mode, and changes depending on whether you are fighting a boss or charging through a level. Development Hades Nebula was developed by Nexus Information Systems. Ben Daglish provided the music for the Commodore 64 version, while John Brozovski made the sound effects for the Atari ST. Reception A review of the Commodore 64 version in Zzap!64 criticized the game's immense difficulty, citing the unwieldy ship as the primary factor. Although the graphics and presentation were considered well done, the game was considered unplayable, receiving a rating of 55% from the magazine.

It allows any stem cell research and therapy in the U.S. state of Missouri that is legal under federal law, including somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce human embryos for stem cell production. It prohibits cloning or attempting to clone a human being, which is defined to mean \\"to implant in a uterus or attempt to implant in a uterus anything other than the product of fertilisation of an egg of a human female by a sperm of a human male for the purpose of initiating a pregnancy that could result in the creation of a human fetus, or the birth of a human being\\". Commercials supporting and opposing the amendment aired during the 2006 World Series, in which the St. Louis Cardinals participated. The issue became especially intertwined with the 2006 U.S. Senate election in Missouri, with the Republican and Democratic candidates on opposite sides of the issue. Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 appeared on the ballot for the November 2006 general election and passed with 51% of the vote.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/10/us/10stemcell.html Support The organization that led the movement to get the initiative on the ballot and later supported its adoption was called the Missouri Coalition for Lifesaving Cures. The measure was proposed to stop repeated attempts by the Missouri Legislature to ban certain types of stem cell research, namely SCNT. Claire McCaskill, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, supported the measure. During the 2006 World Series, which was partially held in St. Louis, a television ad featuring actor Michael J. Fox aired. The ad was paid for by McCaskill's campaign, and the primary reason Fox gave for his support for McCaskill was her stance in favor of stem cell research. The advertisement was controversial because Fox was visibly suffering tremors, which were side effects of the medications used to treat Parkinson's Syndrome. Rush Limbaugh, a conservative radio host, criticized Fox for allowing himself to have been used by special interests supporting the measure. Limbaugh criticized the uncontrollable movements that Fox made in the commercial, and claimed that it was Fox had either deliberately stopped taking his medication or was feigning his tremors. Opposition The coalition that initially led the opposition to the amendment was called Missourians Against Human Cloning. Later in the effort, when the coalition was unable to raise the money for the \\"Vote No\\" ads, Life Communications Fund took the lead in doing so. They created a series of \\"Vote No\\" ads for television, radio and print. Earlier in the campaign, the Vitae Foundation ran a series of educational ads, a \\"prophetic voice campaign,\\" on the differences between adult and embryonic stem cell research, which was a major gain for those opposed to the Amendment, because, according to them, the \\"cures\\" were only occurring as a result of adult stem cell treatments, not via embryonic stem cells. Drawing awareness to the differences between adult and embryonic stem cell research was critical to their strategy. That was the goal of the first ad created in the series. Each ad then slowly moved the target audience (Catholics, Protestants and Evangelicals) to oppose the amendment. The final ad attempted to link embryonic stem cell research to human cloning. A majority of Missourians were opposed to human cloning, especially their target audience. The prophetic voice campaign ran for about 6 months. The \\"Vote No\\" ads ran for roughly 3 months. Jim Talent, an incumbent Republican U.S. Senator facing re-election, was one of several candidates opposed to the amendment. In rebuttal to the Michael J. Fox advertisement (which never directly mentioned Amendment 2), a Life Communications television ad with several celebrities appeared in opposition to the measure. At least three of the celebrities opposed the measure for religious reasons: Kurt Warner, former St. Louis Rams quarterback; Kansas City Royals baseball player Mike Sweeney, and James Caviezel, who played Jesus in The Passion of the Christ. Patricia Heaton from Everybody Loves Raymond opposed the amendment on the grounds that low-income women would be exploited for their eggs. Jeff Suppan, a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, also appeared in opposition to the amendment. Polling As election day drew near, public support seemed to be shifting away from Amendment 2. Polls had shown support as high as 68% in favor of the Amendment in December 2005. By October 29, 2006, support had fallen to 51%, with 35% opposed.October 2006: McCaskill and Talent deadlocked Results and aftermath On November 7, 2006, Amendment 2 passed by a margin of 2.4% (or 50,800 votes). The final tally of votes ended in 51.2% for yes and 48.8% for no. The measure failed in 97 of the 114 counties in the state, but picked up enough votes in St. Louis, Kansas City, and Columbia (and their surrounding counties) to pass statewide. Democrat Claire McCaskill (an amendment supporter) unseated Republican incumbent U.S. Senator Jim Talent (an amendment opponent) the same night that the amendment passed. The very expensive campaigns for and against the amendment broke every record on political spending on statewide races in Missouri.[St.Louis Post Dispatch 10/17/06] Following the passage of the amendment, Stowers Institute for Medical Research canceled plans for a major expansion in Kansas City. Because of the very close vote, the Institute asserted that the political climate in Missouri was too hostile for investment in stem cell research.

Spring attended Lewis and Clark High School then both Gonzaga University in 1951 and Washington State University in 1952. At these schools, he played college baseball for the Bulldogs and Cougars, respectively. Spring pitched in a total of six major league games for three clubs before being acquired by the expansion Los Angeles Angels in 1961. He started four games for L.A. and won three of them in September, then pitched exclusively in relief beginning in 1962. That season, his 57 appearances ranked third in the American League. He, along with Art Fowler, Tom Morgan, and later Julio Navarro, were the Angels' most reliable pitchers out of the bullpen during their second and third seasons. Spring's combined record for 1962 and 1963 was 7-2 with 8 saves and a 3.66 ERA in 102 games. He was traded by the Angels on May 15, 1964 and pitched for three more clubs before making his last major league appearance on August 31, 1965. Career totals include a 12‚Äì5 record in 155 games pitched, five games started, 51 games finished, eight saves, and an ERA of 4.26. In 186 total innings pitched, Spring allowed 195 hits and 78 bases on balls; he fanned 86. He was part of one of the most infamous trades in MLB history, when on June 15, 1964, he accompanied Lou Brock in moving from the Cubs to the Cardinals in the Brock for Broglio deal; Brock led the Cardinals to the 1964 pennant and World Series championship, but Spring appeared in only two games for the Cardinals before being sent to the minor leagues. Spring once went 19 consecutive outings without recording a strikeout, which is the longest such streak since 1957. He was inducted into the Inland Northwest Sports Hall of Fame in 2005 alongside former Utah Jazz basketball player John Stockton at a ceremony in Spokane, WA.

Early life and education  Victor Noble Rainbird was born on 12 December 1887 in North Shields United Kingdom, son of James William Rainbird (b. Ireland 1856, m. 1884) and Rosabella Foubister (b. 1859). Victor had an elder brother William Stewart Rainbird, born in early 1886 in North Shields. Victor attended King's College (now Newcastle University), Newcastle upon Tyne, where he distinguished himself and won several prizes. His pictures were included in a government exhibition which toured Australia, New Zealand and Canada. He later attended the Royal Academy Schools where he twice won Silver Medals as well as the Landseer Scholarship.  Career  Watercolor painting of a fish market by Rainbird On 15 July 1916, Rainbird married Elizabeth Kirkley at York Registry Office, whilst he was a Lance Corporal (38539) in the 6th Northumberland Fusiliers. After the war he left as Corporal in the Durham Light Infantry (46585) and practised as a professional artist in North Shields and exhibited works at the Artists of the Northern Counties exhibitions at the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and also at the Royal Academy. Victor made several trips to France, Belgium and the Netherlands, and a large proportion of his work is of continental subjects. Common works that Rainbird executed many times are of Dutch fisherfolk, the sea and seafront at and around North Shields, and impressions of Rouen and Amiens, Dieppe & Tyne Harbours, Old Ropery Stairs, and North Shields. Rarer subjects include stained glass window images, portraits and still life (flowers). It appears that Rainbird used his paintings to pay his way through life and often seemed to have done paintings to 'pay for his supper'. His work often appears at auctions worldwide, but most commonly at the Newcastle upon Tyne auction house Anderson and Garland, where an average watercolor work of 10 x 14 inches would make around GBP 85.00 (2015) in their quarterly auctions of Fine Art. Plaque on the wall of 71 West Percy Street It was thought that the only surviving example of stained glass work by the artist can be found in Papa Stour Kirk, on the island of Papa Stour in Shetland. It was commissioned to commemorate six Papa men who were lost in World War I and was fitted in 1921. The window depicts Jesus calming a storm. However, in 2014 a fan of Victor Noble Rainbird found two of his missing stained glass windows in Trinity Methodist Church in Allendale Northumberland. They depicts an image of Jesus and a soldier. After being lost for over 94 years, Rainbird's stained glass windows had been found again. Between 1917 and 1933, Victor Noble Rainbird lived at 71 West Percy Street, North Shields. The house still has a blue commemorative plaque marking his residence.

The plot expresses the author's unabashed support of the British Whig Party: she criticises the Tories, religious hypocrisy, and the greed of capitalism. Synopsis Set in 18th-century England, the play tells the story of a military officer who wants to marry a young woman. His obstacles are the four guardians who watch over Anne Lovely. Each of the four has his own idea of the ideal husband. The catch is that each is disagreeable in his own way, and they can't possibly see eye to eye on a man for Anne. To gain Lovely's hand in marriage, soldier Colonel Fainwell must convince the four guardians that he will make an ideal husband. Fainwell takes the bold stroke of wearing elaborate disguises, four of which mimic the personalities and occupations of each of the guardians in turn: an antiquarian, an old beau, a Quaker, and an exchange broker. In all, Fainwell dons the guise of a preening fop, a mysterious world traveler, a shuffling country steward, a dimwitted Dutchman and a fire-and-brimstone preacher in turn. The fire-and-brimstone Quaker character impersonated by Fainwell is Simon Pure, and one point of the plot is to discover the \\"real\\" Simon Pure. Fainwell gets her guardian's permission to wed Lovely but before the marriage can take place, the real Simon Pure shows up at the end to prove his identity. Characters =Main= :Colonel Fainwell is the protagonist in this play, going after the consent of the four guardians to receive Anne Lovely's hand in marriage. His friend Freeman helps him achieve his goals in any way possible. He resorts to impersonations and deceitful behaviours to gain the consent of the four guardians by transforming himself into the ideal husband each guardian seeks. :Anne Lovely is the damsel in distress held hostage by the four guardians. She seeks out an exit from them and relies on Fainwell to obtain consent from her guardians to gain her freedom. She has a massive amount of money that comes with her when she marries after the guardians give consent. She changes her life style and attitude for each guardian she stays with, as she has to stay with a different guardian every three months per year. =Guardians= *Periwinkle is described as an antique collector, his wardrobe collection is made up of clothes of fashion from the last century, and he follows the words of the author of a collection of travellers' tales Sir John Mandeville more than the words of the Bible. Deception to obtain his consent fails the first time, but is successful the second time when tricked into signing the consent when presented with the false Lease for Pillage. *Tradelove is described as a stickler for trade, hates anything that comes with a sword, and a great admirer of Dutch traders believing they understand trade better than any other nation. It is also noted that he is devilish in his dealings, as he cheated his father for the advantage of stock to get a bargain. He is encouraged to offer his consent to marry Anne Lovely to the Dutch trader in lieu of the payment of two thousand pounds wagered. *Sir Philip Modelove is described as a \\"beau\\", an old fashionable man, dresses fancy by keeping with the new fashions, and is the most cheap of the whole company on birthdays. He admires the French and enjoys the French operas, balls, and masquerades. Approved Colonel Fainwell's French behaviours and high class appearance and gave his consent to marry Anne Lovely. He introduces Fainwell to the rest of the guardians. *Obadiah Prim is a very rigid Quaker. At the start of the play Anne Lovely is seen entering Prim's house to start her three-month stay with him. He believes those who are not Quakers are impure. He is deceived by Colonel Fainwell when he impersonates Simon Pure and gives consent to marry Anne Lovely when he is convinced Colonel Fainwell had converted Lovely. =Other= :Mrs. Prim is Obadiah's wife. She is seen to interact with Anne Lovely and constantly gives her a tough time for not being a Quaker and her choice of appearance in clothes. :Betty is Anne Lovely's maid and only friend. :Simon Pure is a Quaker preacher from Pennsylvania who comes to visit Obadiah Prim. His visit creates an entrance for Colonel Fainwell and is impersonated by him. :Freeman is Colonel Fainwell's friend and dedicates himself to help Fainwell achieve his goals with Anne Lovely. He initially introduces Fainwell to his difficult task and directly helps obtain consent from Tradelove by convincing Tradelove to give up consent to Fainwell since he couldn't pay the wager amount he lost. Freeman also keeps an eye out for Colonel Fainwell during his impersonation as Simon Pure and sends in a false letter to help. :Sackbut is the tavern keeper featured often in this play. He describes each guardian to Colonel Fainwell and also helps Fainwell with his goal of obtaining consent from Anne Lovely's guardians. Sackbut acts as a witness to the signing of consent by Tradelove. Summary =Act 1= The act starts with Colonel Fainwell and Freeman at the local tavern as Colonel Fainwell is talking of love. He had seen Anne Lovely earlier in the day and inquires about her to his friend Freeman, who calls upon the Tavern owner Sackbut to tell Fainwell about the four guardians who were left with taking care of Lovely along with more information on Lovely. It is revealed that her father wished Lovely dead a thousand times because he wished the world would end with his passing. Since fortune had to be passed down to Lovely, the father had arranged it so that in order for Lovely to marry, she had to get the consent of all four guardians. Each of the guardians had their own view of the ideal husband in ways that contradicted each other making it impossible for a universal agreement between the four men. Lovely spends three months of each year at each of the guardian's residences with her going to Prim's house at the beginning of the play. With promises of help from Freeman and Sackbut, Fainwell plans on obtaining the consent of the guardians, beginning with Sir Phillip Modelove. During Fainwell's meeting with his friends, Lovely and her assistant Betty discusses Lovely's situation with the guardians. Lovely is sick and tired of being condemned of being the \\"preposterous humours\\" of people in town and being pointed at. Lovely brings up that Colonel Fainwell had promised her freedom from her situation and mentions that she likes the Colonel out of all the men she had ever seen. Key points Fainwell's method of obtaining consent turns out to be the ideal gentleman to each other guardians. Since he has no chance in obtaining consent as himself from all four guardians simultaneously, he is forced to get consent individually. The Colonel only needs to deceive each guardian long enough to receive consent to marry Anne Lovely while disguised as the guardian's ideal husband. =Act 2= Colonel Fainwell shows up at the park dressed nicely to impress Sir Phillip with a few footmen to show off. Fainwell is supposedly dressed in a French style which attracts the attention of Sir Phillip as Colonel approaches him. Once they begin to \\"praise one another\\", the woman sitting with Sir Phillip leaves and the Colonel says everything that Sir Philip wants to hear. Sir Philip gives the consent to the Colonel to marry Anne Lovely, Fainwell is arranged to be introduced personally to the other three guardians. At Obadiah's Prim's house, Mrs. Prim and Anne Lovely are seen arguing about Lovely's choice of dress with Mrs. Prim saying it is too revealing. Lovely argues back saying Mrs. Prim is a prude and a believer of Quaker to Quaker relations. Mr. Prim enters and states that Lovely's breasts are too exposed and that she should hide them with a handkerchief, also stating that it inflames desire in other men. Lovely is upset and declares that her father never meant the tyranny of guardianship controlling her life, while Mr. Prim only defends himself stating all he meant was to prevent her from wearing temping attire and provoking others to sin. Sir Philip and Fainwell arrive at Prim's house and Fainwell is introduced to Mr. Prim formally for the first time. Then he is introduced to Lovely and as he goes to kiss her hand, he attempts to give her a letter which she drops and Prim picks up. After Fainwell reveals to Lovely who he really is, Lovely realises she had made a mistake refusing his letter. She snatches the letter away from Prim and shreds it before anyone can take it back from her. The other guardians arrive and Fainwell is introduced to Periwinkle and Tradelove. Both guardians question Colonel Fainwell, determine that they disapprove of Sir Philip's suggestion, and leave after voicing they would only consent if all of their personal qualifications were met. Key Points We see in this act that Sir Philip is a French admiring fop. He has very big interests in Fashion and is made to believe the Colonel is a higher figure than who he really is to appeal Sir Philip's senses. The Colonel plays every card he knows to mirror Sir Philip's personality to make it seem to \\"‚Ä¶appear to have but one soul, for our ideas and conceptions are the same.\\"(Act 2, Scene 1, 83‚Äì85). In the next scene, we see how Lovely disapproves of the Quaker styles to be forced upon her by covering up any and all tempting features on her body. Mr. and Mrs. Prim's characteristics are revealed even more when the point about romance between Quakers is accepted even with temptation being involved, but if they are not Quakers it is evil and is looked down upon. It is reconfirmed that the disapproval of the other guardians is unanimous, as each fail to see the Colonel as one of their own kind. =Act 3= Act three starts with Sackbut congratulating Colonel Fainwell for the consent of at least one of the guardians. The Colonel is in an Egyptian dress to meet Periwinkle, disguised as a foreigner. Periwinkle is intrigued by not only the foreign appearance of Fainwell, but also the antique \\"habits\\" the Colonel displays. Periwinkle asks Fainwell if he has collected any rarities, as odd trinkets capture his interest including asking if he's had a crocodile. Fainwell plays it off saying that there are more worthy knowledge that he possesses rather than spending it on such petite items. He claims that he knows great knowledge of the sun, more than what Descartes had claimed to discover and find out. With Periwinkle astonished, jealous, and admiring Fainwell, he finishes off with a slew of more items with claims of outrageous things it can do. He finishes off the items with a typical girdle claiming it has the power to make the wearer invisible and able to teleport instantaneously. Fainwell explains that in order for the girdle to work, the others in the room must face east for it to work. After the explanation Periwinkle tries on the girdle, Fainwell and Sackbut turn towards the East, turns back and pretends that Periwinkle had indeed disappeared. Not convinced, Periwinkle requests that the Colonel try the girdle on. Fainwell agrees and when Periwinkle and Sackbut turn East, Fainwell hides underneath a trap door so that when Periwinkle turns back, the illusion of invisibility is played out. After the demonstration, Sackbut raises a point saying that if Periwinkle would purchase the girdle and use, he would be able to travel as he always wanted to. Colonel says that the girdle would never change ownership for money and reveals that the point of the trip was to find the guardians of Lovely for consent of marriage. The first guardian to give consent would receive the girdle and Periwinkle declares that he is one of the four guardians of Lovely. Right when the agreement is to be signed and finalised, a drawer of the tailor reveals to Periwinkle that the foreigner is actually Colonel Fainwell, ruining the Fainwell's plans. Fainwell flees immediately and Freeman enters to set forth the backup plan since the scheme was ruined. Freeman informs that Periwinkle's uncle is dying and suggests that Periwinkle make a trip to the estate despite it being far away. Periwinkle thanks Freeman, leaves, and Colonel and Sackbut re-enters with the plans of going after the next guardian, Tradelove. Key Points Fainwell in this act is dressed up as a foreigner armed with a \\"unique\\" item that is so intriguing to Periwinkle it is to the point Fainwell can demand anything and he will likely receive it. Strangely enough, the item name Fainwell uses is called \\"moros musphonon\\", meaning mousetrap for a fool in Greek. Periwinkle is indeed a fool and is easily manipulated into believing the girdle's abilities. He is also a fool for easily believing the disguised Fainwell was the nephew of his admirer John Tradescant. The plan b for just in case Colonel Fainwell isn‚Äôt able to successfully get the consent of Periwinkle synced very well to set up the stage for the Fainwell's next entrance. =Act 4= Act four opens at the Exchange Alley where all the stock action takes place with Tradelove looking busy. Freeman enters with Fainwell disguised as a Dutch trader with news saying the Spanish had raised their siege from before Cagliari. The note states that no one would know right now, but in a few hours it will go public and this would be the perfect opportunity to make money. Tradelove and Freeman both make transactions that they think will bear fruit, and Freeman mentions to Tradelove that the Colonel has no idea of the potential opportunity present. Tradelove insists that the siege has been raised while Fainwell holds his end saying it hasn‚Äôt resulting in Tradelove betting money. With the bet made, Fainwell and Freeman make it back to Sackbut's Tavern to plan for Periwinkle's opening with his dying uncle. Before they get started, Sackbut enters with a letter addressed for Prim introducing him to a Simon Pure, a leader Quaker. Fainwell plans on impersonating Simon Pure to try to secure consent from Mr. Prim. As Sackbut prepares the Quaker clothes, Sackbut brings in the country dress and boots for Colonel Fainwell to wear as the steward of Periwinkle's uncle. As the Colonel is ready to go, Tradelove shows up at the tavern seeking Freeman's audience. Fainwell disguised as the steward sneaks out, Freeman meets with Tradelove who immediately brings up that the letter Freeman received earlier was a fake. Tradelove loses the bet he made with Colonel Fainwell at the exchange and is unable to pay it. Freeman suggests that Tradelove offer his consent to marry off Anne Lovely without mentioning to the Colonel that he would still require the consent of the other three guardians. Tradelove agrees to this proposal and tells Freeman to ask the \\"Dutch Trader\\" this proposal instead of paying up the two thousand pounds wagered. The scene shifts to the Colonel disguised as the steward at Periwinkle's house informing him of his uncle's death. The Colonel Fainwell now as \\"Pillage\\" sobs in between lines to make it seem like the uncle's death was greatly impacting his life to convince the legitimacy of the situation. Colonel Fainwell brings up the contents of the uncle's will and lastly discusses \\"his\\" lease needs to be renewed with the approval of Periwinkle. Periwinkle approves and as he is inspecting the pen Fainwell hands him, Fainwell switches the lease for the consent contract and Periwinkle signs the consent form unknowingly. With the form in hand, Fainwell leaves Periwinkle's house and returns to the tavern where Freeman and Tradelove are waiting. Before the Colonel has a chance to make an appearance, Tradelove is praising the generosity of the Dutch trader for accepting the proposal of his consent for marriage in lieu of the payment of two thousand pounds. The Colonel now dressed as the Dutch trader enters and secures the deal for consent by the signing of a paper with the agreement with Sackbut and Freeman as witnesses. Tradelove leaves claiming he will put in a good word with the other guardians as he made the Dutch trader believe he was the main man in charge of the marriage of Anne Lovely. On Periwinkle's way out he is smiling thinking that he had the good fortune of relieving his debt for his consent on an impossible marriage situation for the Dutch trader. Key Points Tradelove is seen to admire Dutch traders claiming they know stocks and trade best of all nations and yet he makes a wager with confidence against the Colonel based on the letter Freeman shows him. His cocky behaviour to finally outwit a Dutch trader and his trust in Freeman with the letter of information. Since the \\"Dutch\\" would naturally know better according to the stereotype of Tradelove, Colonel would confidently wage against Tradelove, thus trapping him to make a payment he doesn‚Äôt have forcing Tradelove to give up consent to marry Anne Lovely. After Tradelove finds out about his ruin, he proposes with Freeman's suggestion that he offer consent to the trader of Lovely in lieu of the payment of the money. He emphasises that he is the leader of all the guardians in charge of Lovely's marriage plans, saying that he wouldn‚Äôt give up the consent easily, and other means necessary to make Lovely a better offer than the doomed reality is. The deceit is played out and accepted by the Colonel, making Tradelove feel like a winner when he's the biggest loser. At Periwinkle's house, all goes according to plan as Colonel Fainwell acts as if that death is a true tragedy to help prove that the situation is real. He brings up the lease signing to get a signature one way or another, switching it with the consent contract to secure Anne Lovely from Periwinkle's end. The arrival of Simon Pure's letter was not originally in the plans and represents a godsend for Colonel Fainwell to act as an entrance and opportunity to win Prim's consent to marry Anne Lovely. =Act 5= The act starts at Prim's house with Mrs. Prim and Anne Lovely arguing over Lovely's choice in dress. Lovely declares that she wishes to dress in whatever fashion she desires and claims that Mrs. Prim would have never attracted any man with the way she dresses, even if she did bait them. Mrs. Prim counters, saying that she did indeed attract as much men while properly dressed as Lovely did, claiming that Lovely is all too familiar with wicked people. The guardians all enter and mention that they have found a husband for Lovely, and, as they do, a different guardian shoots the candidate down, despite the fact that the candidate is the same for all three of them. Prim is the only one without a candidate to marry Lovely, which changes quickly when a servant announces that the Colonel, disguised as Simon Pure, has arrived. The Colonel enters in a Quaker's outfit as Lovely and Mrs. Prim re-enter to greet the \\"guest\\". As Lovely enters, Fainwell cannot help but stare at her. Prim notices this and asks why Fainwell stares, which he responds saying that he had a dream and saw Lovely in it. Prim interprets this as Lovely being converted and leaves with Mrs. Prim to have Fainwell convert Lovely so she will become a faithful Quaker. Lovely does not recognise Fainwell in his Quaker disguise and shrieks when he approaches her initially, but Fainwell reveals his identity to calm her down. Due to the shriek, Prim investigates, but Lovely explains she shrieked because of Fainwell's non-stop blabber about converting into a Quaker. Convinced by the situation, Prim exits once again to leave Fainwell and Lovely alone together. Fainwell explains to Lovely that he has the consent of the other three guardians and only needs Prim's to marry her. Lovely understands the situation and plays along with Fainwell, faking that she has indeed converted to being a Quaker. Prim is convinced that Lovely is converted as a servant enters and informs that the real Simon Pure has arrived. Once Simon Pure has arrived, Fainwell's deception holds and a counterfeit letter is brought in stating that there would be an imposter dressed as a Quaker with a mob to rob and kill Prim. Fainwell accuses Simon of being the imposter and Lovely adds on saying that she saw Simon with said mob, convincing Prim to dismiss the real Simon Pure. Fainwell realises his time under cover is short, so he acts quickly and explains that Lovely would not be left alone by the Sathan and Lovely displays attitudes as if the spirits have filled her. With this behavior, Prim gives consent to Fainwell to marry Lovely and signs the consent before Simon returns with proof. Since Fainwell has obtained the consent, he no longer has any reason to deceive anyone anymore and admits that he was the false Simon Pure. All the guardians enter with Freeman and realise that they have all been deceived as Fainwell exposes his many identities to them. Key Points Colonel Fainwell's disguise as a Quaker admits him to the household of Prim and acceptance from him and his wife. After Lovely discovers his disguise, her acting helps persuade Prim into believing Lovely has converted and requires the magic of \\"Simon's\\" convincing to remain a Quaker, hence the speedy consent approval. The fake letter that accuses the fake Simon Pure could have gone both ways. With Fainwell's aggression and Lovely's assistance, Simon is forced to leave long enough for Fainwell to obtain the consent form from Prim. The letter is not planned from Fainwell's knowledge, but he recognises it instantly as Freeman's handwriting, which suggests that Freeman has been keeping watch this entire time in case of Simon's arrival. Analysis Centlivre made fun of all the stereotypes of her time, fearlessly sending up the marriage mart, fashion, commerce, academia and even religion.Kistler, Julie. (15 April 2005) Pantagraph (Bloomington, IL). Illinois Wesleyan theater takes a 'Bold' step forward. Pg. D. History William Hogarth's ticket to the play A Bold Stroke for a Wife was first performed at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, on 3 February 1718, where it ran six nights, which was considered a substantial success. The original cast included James Spiller as Periwinkle, William Bullock as Tradelove, Robert Pack as Obadiah, Christopher Bullock as Colonel Fainwell, John Ogden as Freeman, Jane Rogers as Mrs Lovely and Mary Kent as Mrs Prim. During its long life the play became very popular in the United States. It was produced as early as 1782 (in Baltimore). In 1786 a Charleston, South Carolina, journalist commented that \\"The Bold Stroke for a Wife . . . is one of the few comedies that has stood the test of time -- it is full of business and intrigue and abounds with such a variety as always arrests and keeps up the attention of the audience until it ends.\\"Charleston[SC]Morning Post 10 October 1786 The play continued to find American audiences into the nineteenth century, and was billed as a \\"fine old comedy\\" when it was presented at Wallack's Theatre on Broadway in 1863. In 1960, this play was adapted as the film 'Ek Phool Chaar Kaante' (A Rose and Four Thorns) starring Sunil Dutt and Waheeda Rehman. The four guardians were portrayed by the then four most famous character actors of contemporary Bollywood- David, Dhumal, Rashid Khan and Johnny Walker. In a 1985 production by Double Edge TheatreDouble Edge Theatre of Boston, MA, was founded in 1982, and tries to incorporate 'living culture' into all of its productions. In some ways this can be compared to the concept of 'third theatre.' See Miller, David. (June 1995). TDR (Cambridge, Mass.), MIT Press. Songs at the well: Double Edge Theatre. (Boston, Massachusetts). Pg. 115. the play was set in the androgynous cabaret world of the 1920s as an ironic look at \\"the marriage game\\" written by an 18th-century male impersonator to underscore its cross-gender casting and the wry implications such an approach has in contemporary society.McLaughlin , Jeff. Boston Globe. N.E. Life to Sponsor Performance Series. Section: Arts and Film. Pg. 58. Contribution to language Cast list from first printing, 1718 =Simon Pure= Like the character of Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's play The Rivals, the name Simon Pure soon became a noun for a quality in a person. In Mrs. Malaprop's case, that quality was incorrect usage of a word by substituting a similar-sounding word with different meaning, usually with comic effect. In Simon's case, that quality was authenticity and in Simon's impersonator's case, that quality was hypocrisy.Safire, William. (3 June 1984). The New York Times. On Language; Taint So. Section 6; Pg. 614. In adjectival use, the compound quickly gained a hyphen and lost its capitals when, in 1894, William Dean Howells wrote glowingly of \\"American individuality, the real, simon-pure article.\\" As in boycott from Captain Boycott and bloomer from Amelia Bloomer, names turn into words and lose their capital letters in eponymy. As a noun, Simon Pure is two words; as an adjective, it is lowercase and still holds the hyphen. That keeps the adjectival form untainted. The fact that there were two Simon Pures on stage is probably the reason the term became a confusing one. Depending on how it's used, it can mean either an honest man or a hypocrite who makes a great show of virtue.Miami Herald. (12 July 1985). Front Section. Pg. 25D. In modern usage, Simon Pure has become the source of two expressions: the phrase \\"The real Simon Pure\\", meaning \\"the real man\\"; and the adjective \\"simon-pure\\", meaning either # of genuine, untainted purity or integrity; or # pretentiously, superficially or hypocritically virtuous. In 1984, the term \\"simon-pure\\" received some publicity when Ambassador Robert Morris at the United States State Department conceded that the United States had taken some steps toward economic protectionism, but insisted, \\"If we are not simon-pure, we remain fairly credible.\\"Safire, William. (3 June 1984). The New York Times. On Language; Taint So. Section 6; Pg. 614. As reported by then-The New York Times columnist William Safire, the phrase simon-pure means \\"untainted.\\" In this context, delegates to conventions who are unencumbered by charges of being the creatures of ill-gotten fundsThat is to say, their presence at the convention is not the direct or indirect result of bribes are simon-pure delegates.

Suicide rate in Hong Kong (1981‚Äì2005) According to the figures of World Health Organization, the suicide rate of Hong Kong has been increasing in the recent years. .\\" World Health Organization, 2005. Retrieved 1 November 2006. Between 1981 and 2001, the Hong Kong annual suicide rate rose from 9.6 to 15 per 100,000 people.Community-wide effort needed to tackle suicide:South China Morning Post, 11 January 2006. It even reached a high record in 2002 when 16.4 of every 100,000 people chose to commit suicide. This exceeded the global average of 14.5 suicides per 100,000.STELLA LEE:Suicide prevention gets boost,Hong Kong:South China Morning Post, 10 September 2003. The relatively high suicide rate in 2002 may be due to that year's economic depression. However, SBHK chairman Wong Yao-wing articulated that the problem lies in whether there is enough support for the people in need of help.DONALD ASPREY:More seeking help from suicide hotline,Hong Kong:South China Morning Post, 9 July 2006. Nevertheless, the suicide rate dropped to the global average in the past few years. There were about 1053 and 960 people committing suicide in 2004 and 2005 respectively which brought the suicide rate down from a peak of 18.6 per 100,000 people in 2003 to 14. Such a relatively dramatic decline could be attributed to greater awareness of suicide problems. The director of the center for Suicide Research and Prevention, Dr. Yip Siu-fai believed that there was a need to extend the support services available to those who are contemplating suicide.RAYMOND MA:HK suicide rate drops to global average:South China Morning Post,10 September 2006. Dr. Yip also stated that the decrease of suicide rate had not been seen in Hong Kong before, which shows that suicide is preventable and people can help to improve the situation. He suggested that, to help those with potentially suicide-triggering illness, the government should add suicide prevention in the public issue of health policy.SIMON PARRY:Suicide rate dips to lowest in two decades:South China Morning Post, 28 April 2006. The hotline centre of SBHK revealed that there were 14,688 help-seeking calls in 2005, which was 10.81% more than in 2004. Correspondingly, the suicide rate dropped by 18.5% from 2004 to 2005. It implies that Hong Kong people are becoming more willing to share their problems. Thus, the achievement of SBHK is generally recognised by the public.ÊííÁë™Âà©‰∫ûÊúÉÂπ¥Êé•1.4Ëê¨ÂÆóÊ±ÇÂä© ÂÖÉÊúóÂ±ØÈñÄÂ§©Ê∞¥ÂúçÂ±ÖÈ¶ñ Ë≤°ÁµÄ ÊÉÖÂõ∞ ÊÇ≤ÊÉÖ3ÂçÄÊúÄÂ§ö‰∫∫Ëá™ÊÆ∫ :Wen Wei Po, 9 July 2006. Background The Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong is named after the Good Samaritan, who is a biblical character who was generous and benevolent to help people in difficulty described in the Bible. To set the Good Samaritan as a model, therefore SBHK borrowed the symbolic meaning of Good Samaritan as its organizational name. Although SBHK adopts the word from the Christian Bible as their name, according to their reports, it is a non- religious organisation and doesn't inculcate any religious stance to help seekers. The SBHK is a member of the Samaritan's international network, Befrienders Worldwide Logo The SBHK logo was a modified logo, which was adopted in 1981. In the logo, there are two people standing face to face and holding each other's hands. Between them, the name of SBHK forms a question mark. This is a metaphor of helping, encouraging, and loving each other as SBHK's stated goal. The previous logo, which had been in use for twenty years till 1981, looks like a life buoy surrounding a seven-storied tower representing the Chinese idiom that \\"saving a life is worth more than building a tower of seven storeys\\".(Êïë‰∫∫‰∏ÄÂëΩÂãùÈÄ†‰∏ÉÁ¥ö ÊµÆÂúñ) History In 1960, SBHK was established under the name \\"Suicide Prevention Society\\", which was a local agency run by volunteer workers. The service was the first of its kind in Asia. In 1963, SBHK was registered as a society in Hong Kong and changed its name to \\"The Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong\\". In 1964, there was a significant increase in suicide rate among secondary 5 students because of their setback in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, which greatly alarmed the public. Thus, in the next year, SBHK started a Summer Hotline Service for the Form 5 graduates in Hong Kong, and the service has been running since then. In the 1970s, SBHK offered its services by two units: one operated in Cantonese, the other in English. However, the latter was dissolved in 1982 and developed into a new organisation called \\"The Samaritans\\" which provided 24-hour multilingual hotline service of suicide prevention. In 1994, SBHK was incorporated as a limited company. Recent developments Besides the Hotline service, two centres were established to enable SBHK to reach other service areas and provide a more comprehensive suicide prevention service for the community. A Life Education Center and a Suicidal Crisis Intervention Center were established in 2002. With the support of Mrs. Carrie Lam, JP, Director of Social Welfare and the financial support from both The Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Lotteries Fund, these two centres have been in operation since April 2002. The two new centres together with the existing Hotline Center, though having unique service nature and different objectives, share the common spirit and mission of SBHK. Services = Hotline Center = Telephone Booth Another name of the Hotline Center is \\"TOUCH\\" (ÁîüÊ©üËôïËôï), which stands for \\"Contact\\", \\"Understanding\\" and \\"Sensitivity\\". SBHK's 24-hour Hotline Centre, which has served Hong Kong for almost 40 years, mainly provides immediate emotional support to people who are suffering from depression or have suicidal tendency. The centre has 4 telephone lines (telephone booths) run by nearly 200 volunteers on shift. Usually there are 2 to 3 volunteers on duty and 10 calls can be received at one time. Besides, the Hotline Centre also concentrates on the promotion of suicide prevention in the community. The details of the conversations between SBHK's volunteers and callers are kept confidential, including the brief content of the conversation and the past telephone records, however, valuable and special cases might be shared within SBHK's volunteers for case studying. = Life Education Center = Meeting room Another name of Life Education Center is \\"GROW\\" (ÁÜ±ÊÑõÁîüÂëΩ), which stands for growth by means of Life Education. The life education center mainly promotes suicide prevention by community services, seminars and public reports, and also offers resources to public for researches and information of international suicide prevention conferences. = Suicide Crisis Intervention Center = ALIVE (Ë∑®Ë∂äÊòéÂ§©) is another name of Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre (SCIC), which provides crisis intervention and intensive counselling service to those who are in emergency situations and at moderate or high suicide risk.  Other works and programmes  Caring Fund was set up in 1994 to support the project aiming at promoting the importance of active listening to the people around. Part of the Caring Fund is spent on developing community education and fund raising. SBHK also provided Education Programme and Courses and Joint programmes for the purpose of educating the public. Working method The SBHK operates a 24-hour hotline, provides crisis intervention, life education and interview services, and answers mails from help seekers. The telephone operators of the 24-hour Hotline service are willing to listen to help seekers' problems and understand how they feel. It provides an Interview Service. Help seekers could make appointment for the personal interview or write to the SBHK via letter or e-mail. Besides, some social workers of the SBHK hold talks with parents, teachers, nurses and government officials. Topics mainly focus on emotional problems, pressure, depression and suicide; how to assess emotional changes, how to deal with emotional persecution and how to treasure life . Three Stages of Service: * First stage: Prevention. Its aim is to convey the idea of \\"invaluable life\\" to people who have a little tendency of suicide. This will prevent them from developing suicidal behaviour. * Second stage: Intervention. SBHK's volunteers or employed social workers will be ready to provide counselling service to people with suicidal behaviour. * Third stage: Postvention. People with unsuccessful suicidal behaviour will be tracked by experts who are experienced in this area. This system is the commonly used method, although the center can provide targeted suicide prevention to different groups of people. Volunteers Samaritan volunteers come from different social classes, including teachers, students, housewives and retired people. Volunteers are selected under the screening of \\"Volunteer Selection\\" section. Those who pass the screening section will take a one-year training course before they become a volunteer of SBHK. Besides providing hotline service, volunteers also work to arouse the social awareness of the issue about depression and suicide. Money is needed for all these activities. Therefore, the other duty of volunteers is to raise funds to maintain SBHK services. =Volunteer information= (Statistics at the end of 2004) *The organisation had a total of 218 hotline volunteers ‚Äì 30% male and 70% female *All the volunteers were over 20 years old *The majority (40%) were in the age range of 35 and 44 years old *62.4% of the total had received a tertiary or university education *19.7% came from the white collar *2.8% came from the social service sector *11.9% came from the medical field and education sector SBHK: Annual Report 2004, pp.9. Donation The Community Chest of Hong Kong, The Hong Kong Jockey Club, and Social Welfare funding are the main sources of funds for the Hotline Center (TOUCH), Life Education Center (GROW) and Suicide Crisis Intervention Center (ALIVE). Commercial organisations like PCCW and MTR Corporation also help to donate to the SBHK. Publications SBHK library The publications of SBHK include their annual reports, articles, books and promotional videos, most of which are stored in SBHK's library. * to see more of SBHK's Annual reports * to see more of SBHK's articles * to see more of SBHK's books * to see more of SBHK's promotional videos Performance According to SBHK's 2004 Annual Report, there were 14,315 calls received during 2004. Among them, 9,439 (66%) calls were from the real help seekers, who are emotionally depressed callers. The remaining 4,876 (34%) were \\"fake\\" calls, which are enquiry calls, frivolous calls and silent calls. As compared to the figures of 1994, there was a rise of 8,728 calls received. The rate of \\"real\\" calls enjoyed an increase of 9% as well. Criticism =High rate of missed calls= According to Yahoo News (2006), during the HKCEE result release period, which is also a peak time of teenagers' suicide, Ming Pao reporter found that there were 10 missed calls within 2 hours and the calls were not even transferred to a message box. SBHK announced that during the peak time, Hotline Centre might be overloaded due to the limitation of resources and space, but they promised there would be an increase in the number of Hotline Volunteers accordingly to improve the current situation. On the other hand, according to the interview on 11 February 2006, Mr. Kan, the Vice-chairman of SBHK, pointed out that to avoid overlapping the resources, the number of volunteers would not be increased during the HKCEE period. As SBHK's past records noted, most of the calls made by Form 5 graduates were asking information rather than really seeking emotional support. Since there already exist some other services providing informative guidance to Form 5 graduates, like Hok Yau Club (Â≠∏ÂèãÁ§æ), 1878668 (‰∫∫Èñì‰∫íÂä©Á§æËÅØÁÜ±Á∑ö), etc., SBHK indicated that they would keep the number of Hotline Center volunteers during HKCEE as usual. =Phone number mistake= There was another news report in Apple Daily on 1 July 2006 that a help seeker, Mr. So, phoned the hotline center and asked for an appointment with a social worker. The hotline volunteer jotted down the ID and phone number of Mr. So and told him to wait for the call back in seconds, but it turned out that Mr. So had been waiting for up to 9 hours. The reason of the late call as claimed was the mistaken phone number. SBHK stated that the hotline volunteer transferred Mr. So's case to the Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre shortly after his call and phoned him twice, but Mr So did not answer the phone. After leaving a message and making five phone calls, the social worker still could not get through to Mr. So until someone answered the call and said that he had dialed the wrong number. The centre then checked the number and found that they had mistaken the '3' for '5'. At last, the correct phone call was made at 8:37 p.m. SBHK apologised for the mistake and promised to check the information more carefully in the future.Ëá™ÊÆ∫ÁÜ±Á∑öÁæ©Â∑•ÂØ´ÈåØÈõªË©±ÊãõÊÄ®: Apple Daily, 1 July 2006. = Deficiency of service = According to another news report of Ming Pao on 14 May 2004, a help seeker tried several times to call the SBHK hotline, but there was no one receiving his call. The help seeker also blamed that there was no service for him to leave a message, which made him feel more depressed. SBHK admits that they haven't yet introduced a message recording service. However, as there is not enough volunteers working at late night hours, even if there is a message recording service, workers may not be able to phone back immediately during these periods.

Emerson's produces eight year-round beers and three seasonal beers. In November 2012 the brewery was purchased by Australasian company Lion, which in turn is owned by Japanese brewing giant Kirin. Richard Emerson When Richard Emerson travelled to Scotland with his parents in 1983 he was first introduced to European style beers. After spending a year in Edinburgh, he returned to New Zealand and became disillusioned with New Zealand beers. This lead him to brew for himself. Brewing Emerson‚Äôs beers are not pasteurised like most mainstream New Zealand beers. The yeast is left alive in the beer to mature and enhance the flavour of the beer. Emerson‚Äôs ales are produced from malted barley, hops, yeast and water. They do not have preservatives, added sugar, artificial colouring, have not been pasteurised and some are not filtered. Some Emerson‚Äôs beers are presented in French oak barrels. Pints are sometimes available on hand pump, ensuring that the beer is served at the correct level of carbonation, eliminating gassy beer. Beers Emerson's Brewery beers include London Porter, 1812 India Pale Ale, Weissbier, Pilsner, Bookbinder Bitter, Old 95, Maris Gold and Oatmeal Stout. =Seasonal brews= Taieri George, a 6.8% Belgian-inspired spiced ale, is released every year on 6 March, the birthday of Richard Emerson's father George. It is a bottle-conditioned ale that includes nutmeg, cinnamon and an unnamed spice in its ingredients. The JP is a Belgian ale introduced as a commemorative tribute to University of Otago food scientist Jean-Pierre Dufour. Sales from the beer assist in funding an Otago University student scholarship established by Emerson's in February 2007. JP is produced annually in June and each vintage reflects a different Belgian beer style. Southern Clam Stout is a stout brewed with the additional of locally-sourced littleneck hard clams. The company also produces several beers in the American Pale Ale style. =Other releases= Whiskey Porter is an infusion of dark ale and whisky, achieved by maturing a batch of London Porter in whisky over the course of three to four months. Dunkelweizen is another release. Reception The quality of Emerson's beers was praised by English beer critic Michael Jackson,Michael Jackson Column who rated the 1812 India Pale Ale as one of the best 500 beers in the world.Real Beer New Zealand :: Beer Writer - Neil Miller Emerson's has won numerous beer awards in AustraliaResults - The Australian International Beer Awards - Melbourne, Australia,alcohol,beer,brewers,brewing, competition, beer festival,beverage,drinking,premium,lager,ale,light ale,dark ale,stout,low strength alcohol,mid strength alcohol,wheat beer,specialty ales,bottled beer,canned beer and New Zealand.
