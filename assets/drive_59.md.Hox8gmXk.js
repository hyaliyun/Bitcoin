According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. History The suburb of East York was developed in 1903 with the foresight that industrial expansion would attract a great increase in population. John H. Longstreet's vision foresaw the pathway of expansion. Many beautiful homes were soon built and more building lots awaited new owners. Known to many as the Keesey Tract, the East York area was listed as \\"fronting, for two-thirds of a mile, on both sides of Market Street, York‚Äôs main thoroughfare, and part of the Great Lincoln Highway.\\" Only an eleven-minute ride from Center Square in York, it featured high ground with perfect natural drainage, cement walks and curbs, macadamized streets, pure filtered water, electric lights, and a complete sewer system. The York Railways Company lines ran the entire length of Market Street through the center of the tract and to adjoining boroughs. For a single carfare, one could ride the entire length of Market Street. The East York area offered its members all the privileges of an up-to-date club. Any resident could be member and enjoy its privileges, including dining services, games, lawn tennis, and the entire social advantages attendant thereto. The club's privileges were also open to members‚Äô families. On East Market Street and nearby stood the area residences of George L. Stallman, Charles E. Tucker, Mahlon N. Haines, Congressman E.S. Brooks, Professor C.B. Heinly, Cleaver and Merrihew, William J. Gribben, E. P. Minnich, Dr. J.E. Barrick, and Sarah J. Mitzel. The East York Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hiestand School upright=1.4 In 1912, the John S. Hiestand School was built in the area on land donated by John S. Longstreet. This school was built in what was then the Independent School District. A graded school, managed by a progressive Board of Directors, its students were taught by competent teachers in all grades from first to eighth and prepared for entrance into York High School. There, tuition was paid for by the Independent School District under an agreement with the city school board. The first consideration in designing and erecting the building was the children's welfare. The building was located in the center of ample playgrounds, had two classrooms, boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô cloakrooms, functional toilets, and large basement playrooms for use in bad weather. The school, where all students and residents could obtain free use of well-selected books, also maintained a public library. The original two classrooms were doubled to four in 1927 and there were six rooms by 1937. The Hiestand School was closed in June 1978 for financial reasons and due to declining enrollment, and has been used subsequently by various community organizations.

In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would be devoured by Ammit. Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade through a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin . A damned human \\"in damnation\\" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor. Following the religious meaning, the words damn and goddamn are a common form of religious profanity, in modern times often semantically weakened to the status of mere interjections. Etymology Classical Latin damnum means \\"damage, cost, expense; penalty, fine\\", ultimately from a PIE root *dap-. The verb damnare in Roman law acquired a legal meaning of \\"to pronounce judgement upon\\". The word entered Middle English usage from Old French in the early 14th century. The secular meaning survives in English \\"to condemn\\" (in a court of law), or \\"damning criticism\\". The noun damnation itself is mostly reserved for the religious sense in Modern English, while condemnation remains common in secular usage. During the 18th century and until about 1930, the use of damn as an expletive was considered a severe profanity and was mostly avoided in print. The expression \\"not worth a damn\\" was recorded in 1802. The use of damn as an adjective, short for damned, was recorded in 1775. Damn Yankee (a Southern US term for \\"Northerner\\") dates back to 1812. Christianity In most forms of Western Christian belief, damnation to hell is what humanity deserves for its sins. Catholic and many Protestant denominations hold that human sin is the product of the fall of man of Adam and Eve in the book of Genesis. In some Christian denominations, only the sins that the Ten Commandments describe cause damnation, but others apply more strict terms. The reasons for being damned have varied widely through the centuries, with little consistency between different forms of Christianity (i.e., Catholic or Protestant). \\"Sins\\" ranging from murder to dancing have been said to lead to damnation. Christian denominations have differing views on soteriology, but a mainstream view is that believers can only escape damnation by salvation from Jesus Christ. One conception is of suffering and denial of entrance to Heaven, often described in the book of Revelation as burning in a Lake of Fire. Another conception, derived from the scripture about Gehenna is simply that people will be discarded (burned), as being unworthy of preservation by God. Eastern Christian traditions (Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy) differ drastically from their western counterparts on the subject matter, viewing sin in less legalistic sense, but more as a spiritual illness that needs to be cured and purged.Thus it is the Church's spiritual teaching that God does not punish man by some material fire or physical torment. God simply reveals Himself in the risen Lord Jesus in such a glorious way that no man can fail to behold His glory. It is the presence of God's splendid glory and love that is the scourge of those who reject its radiant power and light. ... those who find themselves in hell will be chastised by the scourge of love. How cruel and bitter this torment of love will be! For those who understand that they have sinned against love, undergo no greater suffering than those produced by the most fearful tortures. The sorrow which takes hold of the heart, which has sinned against love, is more piercing than any other pain. It is not right to say that the sinners in hell are deprived of the love of God ... But love acts in two ways, as suffering of the reproved, and as joy in the blessed! (St. Isaac of Syria, Mystic Treatises) The Orthodox Church of America website it is seen as a state of opposition to the love of God, a state into which all humans are born but against which Jesus Christ is the Mediator and Redeemer. Eastern traditions have established their views on Paradise and Gehenna from theologians like Isaac of Nineveh and Basil of Caesarea and the Fathers of the Church. According to Orthodoxy, Heaven and Hell are relations to or experiences of God's just and loving presence, with often used analogy being how Sun melts wax and hardens the clay, with different reactions to sunlight depending not on sun but the matter that reacts to it. Similarly, Saints enjoy the loving presence of God, while the damned are enraged by it.Man has a malfunctioning or non-functioning noetic faculty in the heart, and it is the task especially of the clergy to apply the cure of unceasing memory of God, otherwise called unceasing prayer or illumination. \\"Those who have selfless love and are friends of God see God in light‚ÄîDivine light, while the selfish and impure see God the judge as fire‚Äîdarkness\\". \\"Those who have selfless love and are friends of God see God in light‚Äîdivine light, while the selfish and impure see God the judge as fire‚Äîdarkness\\". Proper preparation for vision of God takes place in two stages: purification, and illumination of the noetic faculty. Without this, it is impossible for man's selfish love to be transformed into selfless love. This transformation takes place during the higher level of the stage of illumination called theoria, literally meaning vision-in this case vision by means of unceasing and uninterrupted memory of God. Those who remain selfish and self-centered with a hardened heart, closed to God's love, will not see the glory of God in this life. However, they will see God's glory eventually, but as an eternal and consuming fire and outer darkness. From FRANKS, ROMANS, FEUDALISM, AND DOCTRINE/Diagnosis and Therapy Father John S. Romanides Diagnosis and Therapy In the Eastern Orthodox tradition theologians can describe God by presenting negative descriptions of what God is not, and describe Gehenna in similar ways. Hinduism In Hinduism, one of the three main acharyas, Acharya Madhva or Madhvacharya differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes. One class of souls, mukti- yogyas, qualifies for liberation, another, the nitya-samsarins, subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class, tamo-yogyas, who are condemned to eternal hell (Andhatamas), since their guilt cannot be obliterated according to him. No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs.Helmuth von Glasenapp: Der Hinduismus. Religion und Gesellschaft im heutigen Indien, Hildesheim 1978, p. 248. In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation, that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if after millions of rebirths. As profanity \\"Damn\\" is nowadays a mildly profane word in English, although \\"God damn\\" (or \\"Goddamn\\") may be considered blasphemous by religious people, who regard it as a violation of the commandment against taking God's name in vain. \\"Dang\\" (mainly US) or \\"darn\\" are common euphemisms, specifically minced oaths, for \\"damn\\". The profanity of \\"damn\\" and its derivatives (e.g. \\"damned\\", \\"damnation\\") is effectively limited to cases where the word is not used in its literal meaning, e.g., \\"The damned dog won't stop barking!\\" (but the line of Arthur Miller's character John Proctor to his servant, \\"God damns all liars\\" uses the word in its literal sense and has not been seen as objectionable). Use of the word or its derivatives in their figurative forms may impact on the ratings of movies and television programmes. In Indian English, there is an incorrect etymology connecting \\"I don't give a damn\\" with the dam, a 16th-century copper coin. Salman Rushdie, in a 1985 essay on the dictionary of Anglo-Indian terms 'Hobson-Jobson', ends with this: :\\"'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a small copper coin weighing one tolah, eight mashas and seven surkhs, being the fortieth part of a rupee.'

History Originally settled by the English Quakers from Chester County as early as 1730, and German immigrants from the York and Hanover areas in the late 18th century, much of the land now encompassed by Fairview Township was part of Pennsborough Township, Lancaster County. York County, when separated from Lancaster in 1749, had no definitely established northern boundary. In 1751, after the formation of Cumberland from Lancaster County, the Provincial Assembly passed a special act making Yellow Breeches Creek the official boundary between counties. At that time, the lands in this area were annexed to Newberry Township, where they remained until February 1803, when the York County Court approved petitions of area citizens to create the Township of Fairview. In the mid-18th century, the area known as New Market was owned by John Harris, founding father of Harrisburg and a trader with the large Shawnee Indian settlement at the mouth of Yellow Breeches Creek. By 1806, the area boasted several churches, stores, a working forge, and a distillery. The growth of this particular portion of the township was due, in large part, to the establishment of a ferry across the Susquehanna River and the York-Harrisburg Road, which passed through the area. In 1807, a 120-lot village was laid out, and lots were sold by lottery drawing held at the local tavern. The owner of the New Market Forge, Jacob Haldeman Sr., who also had a working forge in Lisburn (thus, Forge Road), was responsible for laying out the town of New Cumberland in 1814, and selling the lots with the same lottery method used for New Market. Fairview Township began as an agricultural area, with only a small amount of industry and trade. Because of its primary agricultural base, township population growth was very slow after the initial settlement. The first census count in 1820 was 1,764. Eighty years later, in 1900, the number reached 2,042, an increase of only 278. By 1950, it had more than doubled to 5,514, and 1990 figures showed the township population at 13,258. The development of better highway systems and the suburban growth of the Harrisburg area have greatly changed portions of the township over the last 50 years. The Ashton-Hursh House and Etters Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Infrastructure Capital City Airport (currently used by general aviation; formerly Harrisburg's principal airport) and the New Cumberland Army Depot both lie in Fairview Township.

The population was 952 at the 2010 census. For historical reasons, the post office in Goldsboro is named \\"Etters\\" even though there is no incorporated place known by that name, and the United States Postal Service (USPS) states that the name \\"Etters\\" is preferred over \\"Goldsboro\\" for addressing mail to ZIP code 17319. History In 1738 Nathan Hussey, a Quaker, from New Castle County, Delaware, obtained a grant for land on which the Village of Goldsboro now stands. In 1743 a road from Walnut Bottom, now in Cumberland County, to Hussey's ferry was built. The turnpike was completed in 1816 from York to Harrisburg. Along the turnpike, near the site of Hussey's Ferry (now Middletown Ferry) Henry Etter established Etter's Tavern, which included Etter's Post Office by 1838. Goldsboro was founded in 1850 upon completion of a railroad from York Haven to Harrisburg. Prior to completion of the railroad the 20 or so houses that made up Goldsboro were affectionately referred to as Martinsville, for Martin P. Burger who owned a store near the village. When the railway was completed in 1850, the village was named Goldsborough in honor of J.M. Goldsborough, the civil engineer of the railway. Dr. Alexander Small in 1849 surveyed Goldsborough and officially advertised lots for sale in the village of Goldsborough as early as November 19, 1850. The Borough of Goldsborough was incorporated in 1864. A historical association was founded in 1976. The Goldsboro Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Source of the name \\"Etters\\" The name \\"Etters\\", used by the USPS to refer to the post office in Goldsboro, comes from the establishment in 1838 of a post office inside a tavern owned by Henry Etter, a former Revolutionary War soldier, about a mile north of the current location of Goldsboro. The post office was moved to Goldsboro in 1850, at which time it retained the name \\"Etter's\\" to avoid confusion with the already established post office in Gouldsboro, Wayne County, PA.

In 1739, the Provincial Assembly passed a special act to empower Lancaster County to establish townships west of the river. Hellam Township was created and included most of what is now York, Adams and Cumberland counties.

The town is situated in a productive agricultural region. The population was 15,289 at the 2010 census. The borough is served by the 717 area code and the ZIP Codes of 17331-34. Hanover is named after the German city of Hannover. The site of the final encounter between the Union and Confederate States armies before they fought against each other in the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War, this borough has since become known as the \\"Snack Food Capital of the World\\" due to the establishment of multiple food manufacturing businesses there during the 20th century.Parks, Shoshi. \\"How the Pennsylvania Dutch Turned a Rural Town into a Snack Food Empire.\\" Washington, D.C.: NPR, April 29, 2019. History In 1727, John Digges, an Irish nobleman of Prince George's County, Maryland, obtained a grant of of land where Hanover is now located from Charles Calvert, the fourth Lord Baltimore. The area was called Digges Choice, and in 1730, a group of Catholics started the settlement that became known as the Conewego Settlement. Settlers from both Maryland and Pennsylvania began moving into the area in the 1730s. At this time, Maryland and Pennsylvania did not agree on the northern border of Maryland and the southern border of Pennsylvania, and the area that is now Hanover was in the disputed area claimed by both states. This led to numerous disputes about property ownership from the 1730s until 1760. The dispute was settled when Maryland and Pennsylvania hired British experts Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to survey what became known as the Mason‚ÄìDixon Line. This line was surveyed between 1763 and 1767, and put an end to decades of disputes over rights and ownership. In 1745, a Scot-Irishman named Richard McAllister purchased the tract of land upon which the original town of Hanover was built. McAllister was a Presbyterian who had recently migrated from the Cumberland Valley. Hanover at that time was covered with a dense forest of hickory, walnut, and oak trees. McAllister erected a log house at what is now the corner of Baltimore and Middle streets, and opened a store and tavern. In 1763, McAllister divided his farm into lots and founded the town of Hanover. German settlers nicknamed the settlement \\"Hickory Town\\" after the thick groves of hickory trees that grew in the area. The name Hanover was suggested by Michael Tanner, who was one of the commissioners who laid out York County in 1749 and owned large tracts of land southeast of the town. Tanner's choice of the name came from the fact that he was a native of Hannover, Germany. The town's founders, who wanted to please the German settlers, agreed to the name. Hanover was also sometimes referred to as \\"McAllister's Town\\" in its early years. Hanover and the American Revolution Thomas Jefferson spent the night of April 12, 1776 at the Sign of the Horse, an inn, owned by Caspar Reinecker on Frederick Street. Records indicate that Jefferson paid \\"Rhenegher\\" 11 shillings, 6 pence for dinner and lodging. He was on his way from Monticello to Philadelphia to attend the first meeting of the Continental Congress, where on June 10 he would begin the draft the Declaration of Independence. At the time, Hanover was located at the crossing of two well- traveled roads, one from the port of Baltimore to points north and west and the other between Philadelphia and the Valley of Virginia. When Jefferson returned from Philadelphia to Monticello, he again dined and spent the night of September 5 at Reinecker's inn.\\"Monticello Research Report\\", J.R. McGrew, May 1991. At the start of the Revolutionary War, Hanover consisted of about 500 homes, most of which were built out of logs. After the war, the population increased steadily until the War of 1812. At the time of the advance of the British on Baltimore in 1814, Hanover and vicinity furnished two companies of infantry commanded by Captain Frederick Metzgar and John Bair. These two companies left Hanover on foot Sunday morning, August 28, 1814, and reached the city of Baltimore at 9 A.M., Tuesday. September 11, where they were marched to North Point, spending that night on their arms, and next day, the memorable September 12, 1814, they took part in the engagement with the British, who retreated soon after. The Hanover Companies together with other companies from York County, returned home after two weeks' service, not being needed longer. After the War of 1812, the town experienced only minor growth until 1852, when construction of the Hanover Branch Railroad to Hanover Junction was completed. In 1858 the Gettysburg Railroad opened a railroad link westward to Gettysburg. The Hanover and York Railroad completed a rail line to York in 1876. Civil War era The sculpture Sentry, erected in Center Square in 1904, shows a Union cavalry soldier on sentry duty. During the American Civil War, the Battle of Hanover was fought on June 30, 1863. Union cavalry under Judson Kilpatrick encountered Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart and a sharp fight ensued in the town and in farm fields to the south, particularly along Frederick Street. The final encounter between Union and Confederate forces prior to the Battle of Gettysburg, this inconclusive engagement delayed the Confederate cavalry on their way to the Battle of Gettysburg.Parks, \\"How the Pennsylvania Dutch Turned a Rural Town into a Snack Food Empire,\\" NPR. Three days before the battle, another detachment of Virginia cavalry had briefly occupied Hanover, \\"collecting\\" supplies and horses from local citizens. Over the years, its industries have included the making of cigars, gloves, silks, flavine, water wheels, flour, shirts, shoes, machine-shop products, furniture, wire cloth, and ironstone grinders. The town has lent its name to a brand of canned vegetables, and a mail-order gift company based there. Hanover's first newspaper, Die Pennsylvania Wochenschrift, was published in German in 1797. In 1805, the \\"Hanover Gazette\\" followed suit, also published in German.

History Codorus Furnace Codorus Forge and Furnace Historic District, which dates to 1765, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The Mifflin House, an Underground Railroad site in the township dating to the 1700s, was used by the Mifflin family in the 19th century to \\"hide freedom-seekers and ferry them across the Susquehanna River on their way to Philadelphia.\\" The house was sold into the Huber family in 1856, who sold it to the Blessing family in 1959. As of May 2017, the property was at risk of demolition for development of a business park. By December 2017, a funding campaign was started to help pay for a legal challenge to save the property, reportedly eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In July 2018, a York County Court of Common Pleas judge ruled in favor of a township zoning officer's decision (and zoning hearing board's support) to deny a demolition permit for the house. The developer appealed the decision to the Commonwealth Court. In February 2019, township supervisors approved unanimously a subdivision plan that includes a two-year moratorium on development of more than surrounding Mifflin House, to give preservationists time to raise enough money to save it.

The population was 362 at the 2010 census. Geography Lewisberry is located at (40.135300, -76.860504). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. Ski Roundtop is located southwest of Lewisberry. History=Early settlement The lands in and around the borough of Lewisberry were under control of the Susquehannock people until the first Quaker settlements in the 1730s. These settlements were among the first Quaker settlements in America west of the Susquehanna River. Among the group of original titleholders along the small creek that would become known as Bennett Run were Ellis Lewis, Joseph Bennett, John Rankin, John Heald, and John Hall. At this time, the area that would become York County was still almost entirely populated by the Susquehannock Indians. Yet there are few recorded conflicts between these early settlers and the native population. In this area that would later become majority Pennsylvania German, the first and second waves of settlers were almost entirely English speakers and included the Kirks, Rankins, Huttons, Garetsons, Nebingers, Eppleys, Starrs, Fosters, Clines, Stromingers, Moores, Frankelbergers, Suttons, Wickershams, Prowells, Millers, and Hammonds. While most were Quakers, a significant minority were Anglicans. The Quaker meeting house at the intersection of Old Quaker and Lewisberry roads (PA 382) is the original Quaker meeting house in the area. Founding of borough Lewisberry's Keystone Marker The borough's founder, Eli Lewis, was born nearby in 1750, the son of one of the original settlers, Ellis Lewis. On the eve of the American Revolution, Eli opened a store on the site of the current borough. Lewis and members of other prominent families in the area served in the Pennsylvania militia, and Eli rose to the rank of major. Over the course of the war, the town became known for producing guns, and the Committee of Safety for York County contracted with area gunsmiths to supply the Continental Army; guns made in Lewisberry were in use by the US Army as late as the Siege of Veracruz during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846. Following the Revolutionary War, Lewis' fortune grew (and he eventually owned 850 acres in the area) and his store was the center of commerce in the Redland Valley. In 1798, Issac Kirk surveyed twelve acres of land and laid out lots for Lewis, who wanted a town to exist on the site. While all of the lots were not immediately sold, many were, and the town began a modest growth. Between 1790 and 1798, Major Lewis had lived in Harrisburg, where he took up printing and published the first Harrisburg newspaper, The Advertiser, which was then sold to John Wyeth, who renamed it The Oracle of Dauphin. While living in Harrisburg, Lewis also published the popular poem, \\"St. Clair's Defeat,\\" which described the defeat of Arthur St. Clair by the tribes of the Western Confederacy during the Battle of the Wabash. Incorporation and growth Lewisberry was not incorporated until 1832, fifty years later, and the first census figures of 1840 show a population of 220. In 1800, Henry Ensminger opened a large tannery just south of town that was later owned and operated by Samuel Grove. More significant for the town's growth was John Herman, who built a large flour mill on the west side of the borough. But the town's most successful operator was Andrew Cline, who ran a large and successful milling business during the second half of the 19th century. The mill and house are still standing just outside the borough beside Silver Lake, which was created to power the mill. One of Lewisberry's most important small industries during the 19th and early 20th centuries was the manufacture of block brimstone matches, and the families of Lyman Lewis, Herman Kirk, Moses Magrew, Rt. Starr, and Lyman Shettle became prosperous through this industry. In the early 19th century, Joseph Potts manufactured the area's first coffee mills out of his home. This industry grew under his children, and by the middle of the century, Lewisberry was producing large numbers of coffee grinders in a small factory near the Quaker meeting house. In 1835, William Smith started a newspaper in the bustling town. In 1837, Lewisberry native Hervey Hammond began manufacture of the patented Hammond window sash spring, and in 1838, President Martin Van Buren installed Hammond springs in all of the White House's windows.Prowell, George R.

It was a condition of debt bondage and indentured servitude with similarities to slavery, which developed during the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages in Europe and lasted in some countries until the mid-19th century. As with slaves, serfs could be bought, sold, or traded, with some limitations: they generally could be sold only together with land (with the exception of the kholops in Russia and villeins in gross in England who could be traded like regular slaves), could be abused with no rights over their own bodies, could not leave the land they were bound to, and could marry only with their lord's permission. Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the lord of the manor who owned that land. In return, they were entitled to protection, justice, and the right to cultivate certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also in his mines and forests and to labor to maintain roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society, and the lord of the manor and the villeins, and to a certain extent the serfs, were bound legally: by taxation in the case of the former, and economically and socially in the latter. The decline of serfdom in Western Europe has sometimes been attributed to the widespread plague epidemic of the Black Death, which reached Europe in 1347 and caused massive fatalities, disrupting society. The decline, however, had begun before that date. Serfdom became increasingly rare in most of Western Europe after the medieval renaissance at the outset of the High Middle Ages. But, conversely, it grew stronger in Central and Eastern Europe, where it had previously been less common (this phenomenon was known as \\"later serfdom\\"). In Eastern Europe, the institution persisted until the mid-19th century. In the Austrian Empire, serfdom was abolished by the 1781 Serfdom Patent; corv√©e continued to exist until 1848. Serfdom was abolished in Russia in the 1860s. Prussia declared serfdom unacceptable in its General State Laws for the Prussian States and finally abolished it in October 1807, in the wake of the Prussian Reform Movement.Edikt den erleichterten Besitz und den freien Gebrauch des Grundeigentums so wie die pers√∂nlichen Verh√§ltnisse der Land-Bewohner betreffend In Finland, Norway, and Sweden, feudalism was never fully established, and serfdom did not exist; however, serfdom-like institutions did exist in both Denmark (the stavnsb√•nd, from 1733 to 1788) and its vassal Iceland (the more restrictive vistarband, from 1490 until 1894). According to medievalist historian Joseph R. Strayer, the concept of feudalism can also be applied to the societies of ancient Persia, ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt (Sixth to Twelfth dynasty), Islamic-ruled Northern and Central India, China (Zhou dynasty and end of Han dynasty) and Japan during the Shogunate. However, Wu Ta-k'un argued that the Shang-Zhou fengjian were kinship estates, quite distinct from feudalism. James Lee and Cameron Campbell describe the Chinese Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) as also maintaining a form of serfdom. Melvyn Goldstein described Tibet as having had serfdom until 1959, but whether or not the Tibetan form of peasant tenancy that qualified as serfdom was widespread is contested by other scholars.Barnett, Robert (2008) \\"What were the conditions regarding human rights in Tibet before democratic reform?\\" in: Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China‚Äôs 100 Questions, pp. 81‚Äì83.

DoF, MoA The United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery also prohibits serfdom as a practice similar to slavery. History Galician slaughter in 1846 was a revolt against serfdom, directed against manorial property and oppression. Social institutions similar to serfdom were known in ancient times. The status of the helots in the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta resembled that of the medieval serfs. By the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire faced a labour shortage. Large Roman landowners increasingly relied on Roman freemen, acting as tenant farmers, instead of slaves to provide labour. These tenant farmers, eventually known as coloni, saw their condition steadily erode. Because the tax system implemented by Diocletian assessed taxes based on both land and the inhabitants of that land, it became administratively inconvenient for peasants to leave the land where they were counted in the census. However, medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century. During this period, powerful feudal lords encouraged the establishment of serfdom as a source of agricultural labor. Serfdom, indeed, was an institution that reflected a fairly common practice whereby great landlords were assured that others worked to feed them and were held down, legally and economically, while doing so. This arrangement provided most of the agricultural labour throughout the Middle Ages. Slavery persisted right through the Middle Ages, but it was rare. In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to disappear west of the Rhine even as it spread through eastern Europe. Serfdom reached Eastern Europe centuries later than Western Europeit became dominant around the 15th century. In many of these countries serfdom was abolished during the Napoleonic invasions of the early 19th century, though in some it persisted until mid- or late- 19th century. Russia Serfdom became the dominant form of relation between Russian peasants and nobility in the 17th century. Serfdom only existed in central and southern areas of the Russian Empire. It was never established in the North, in the Urals, and in Siberia. According to the Encyclopedia of Human Rights: :In 1649 up to three- quarters of Muscovy's peasants, or 13 to 14 million people, were serfs whose material lives were barely distinguishable from slaves. Perhaps another 1.5 million were formally enslaved, with Russian slaves serving Russian masters. Russia's over 23 million privately held serfs were freed from their lords by an edict of Alexander II in 1861. The owners were compensated through taxes on the freed serfs. State serfs were emancipated in 1866.David Moon, Abolition of Serfdom in Russia: 1762‚Äì1907 (2002) Etymology Costumes of slaves or serfs, from the sixth to the twelfth centuries, collected by H. de Vielcastel from original documents in European libraries The word serf originated from the Middle French serf and was derived from the Latin (\\"slave\\"). In Late Antiquity and most of the Middle Ages, what are now called serfs were usually designated in Latin as coloni. As slavery gradually disappeared and the legal status of servi became nearly identical to that of the coloni, the term changed meaning into the modern concept of \\"serf\\". The word \\"serf\\" is first recorded in English in the late 15th century, and came to its current definition in the 17th century. Serfdom was coined in 1850. Dependency and the lower orders Serfs had a specific place in feudal society, as did barons and knights: in return for protection, a serf would reside upon and work a parcel of land within the manor of his lord. Thus, the manorial system exhibited a degree of reciprocity. One rationale held that serfs and freemen \\"worked for all\\" while a knight or baron \\"fought for all\\" and a churchman \\"prayed for all\\"; thus everyone had a place. The serf was the worst fed and rewarded, but at least he had his place and, unlike slaves, had certain rights in land and property. A lord of the manor could not sell his serfs as a Roman might sell his slaves. On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord; simply speaking, they were implicitly sold in mass and as a part of a lot. This unified system preserved for the lord long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission, nor did he possess a saleable title in them. Becoming a serf A freeman became a serf usually through force or necessity. Sometimes the greater physical and legal force of a local magnate intimidated freeholders or allodial owners into dependency. Often a few years of crop failure, a war, or brigandage might leave a person unable to make his own way. In such a case he could strike a bargain with a lord of a manor. In exchange for gaining protection, his service was required: in labour, produce, or cash, or a combination of all. These bargains became formalized in a ceremony known as \\"bondage\\", in which a serf placed his head in the lord's hands, akin to the ceremony of homage where a vassal placed his hands between those of his overlord. These oaths bound the lord and his new serf in a feudal contract and defined the terms of their agreement.Marc Bloch, Feudal Society: The Growth of the Ties of Dependence. Often these bargains were severe. A 7th-century Anglo Saxon \\"Oath of Fealty\\" states: To become a serf was a commitment that encompassed all aspects of the serf's life. Moreover, the children born to a serf inherited the status of the parent, and were considered born into serfdom at birth. By taking on the duties of serfdom, individuals bound not only themselves but their future progeny. Class system The social class of the peasantry can be differentiated into smaller categories. These distinctions were often less clear than suggested by their different names. Most often, there were two types of peasants: # freemen, workers whose tenure within the manor was freehold # villein Lower classes of peasants, known as cottars or bordars, generally comprising the younger sons of villeins; Studies of field systems in the British Isles By Alan R. H. Baker, Robin Alan Butlin An Economic History of the British Isles By Arthur Birnie. P. 218 vagabonds; and slaves, made up the lower class of workers. =Coloni= Colonus system used in the late Roman Empire can be considered as predecessor of Western European feudal serfdom. =Freemen= Freemen, or free tenants held their land by one of a variety of contracts of feudal land-tenure and were essentially rent-paying tenant farmers who owed little or no service to the lord, and had a good degree of security of tenure and independence. In parts of 11th-century England freemen made up only 10% of the peasant population, and in most of the rest of Europe their numbers were also small. =Ministeriales= Ministeriales were hereditary unfree knights tied to their lord, that formed the lowest rung of nobility in the Holy Roman Empire. =Villeins= A villein (or villain) represented the most common type of serf in the Middle Ages. Villeins had more rights and higher status than the lowest serf, but existed under a number of legal restrictions that differentiated them from freemen. Villeins generally rented small homes, with a patch of land. As part of the contract with the landlord, the lord of the manor, they were expected to spend some of their time working on the lord's fields. The requirement often was not greatly onerous, contrary to popular belief, and was often only seasonal, for example the duty to help at harvest- time. The rest of their time was spent farming their own land for their own profit. Villeins were tied to their lord's land and couldn't leave it without his permission. Their lord also often decided whom they could marry. Like other types of serfs, villeins had to provide other services, possibly in addition to paying rent of money or produce. Villeins were somehow retained on their land and by unmentioned manners could not move away without their lord's consent and the acceptance of the lord to whose manor they proposed to migrate to. Villeins were generally able to hold their own property, unlike slaves. Villeinage, as opposed to other forms of serfdom, was most common in Continental European feudalism, where land ownership had developed from roots in Roman law. A variety of kinds of villeinage existed in Europe in the Middle Ages. Half-villeins received only half as many strips of land for their own use and owed a full complement of labour to the lord, often forcing them to rent out their services to other serfs to make up for this hardship. Villeinage was not, however, a purely uni-directional exploitative relationship. In the Middle Ages, land within a lord's manor provided sustenance and survival, and being a villein guaranteed access to land, and crops secure from theft by marauding robbers. Landlords, even where legally entitled to do so, rarely evicted villeins because of the value of their labour. Villeinage was much preferable to being a vagabond, a slave, or an unlanded labourer. In many medieval countries, a villein could gain freedom by escaping from a manor to a city or borough and living there for more than a year; but this action involved the loss of land rights and agricultural livelihood, a prohibitive price unless the landlord was especially tyrannical or conditions in the village were unusually difficult. In medieval England, two types of villleins existed-villleins regardant that were tied to land villleins in gross that could be traded separately from land. =Bordars and cottagers= In England, the Domesday Book, of 1086, uses bordarii (bordar) and cottarii (cottar) as interchangeable terms, \\"cottar\\" deriving from the native Anglo-Saxon tongue whereas \\"bordar\\" derived from the French. Punishment with a knout. Whipping was a common punishment for Russian serfs.Chapman, Tim (2001). Imperial Russia, 1801‚Äì1905. Routledge. p.83. Status-wise, the bordar or cottar ranked below a serf in the social hierarchy of a manor, holding a cottage, garden and just enough land to feed a family. In England, at the time of the Domesday Survey, this would have comprised between about .Daniel D. McGarry, Medieval history and civilization (1976) p 242 Under an Elizabethan statute, the Erection of Cottages Act 1588, the cottage had to be built with at least of land. However, the later Enclosures Acts (1604 onwards) removed the cottars' right to any land: \\"before the Enclosures Act the cottager was a farm labourer with land and after the Enclosures Act the cottager was a farm labourer without land\\". The bordars and cottars did not own their draught oxen or horses. The Domesday Book showed that England comprised 12% freeholders, 35% serfs or villeins, 30% cotters and bordars, and 9% slaves. =Smerd= Smerdy were a type of serfs above kholops in Medieval Poland and Kievan Rus'. =Kholops= Kholops were the lowest class of serfs in the medieval and early modern Russia. They had status similar to slaves, and could be freely traded. =Gaelic Ireland= In Gaelic Ireland, a political and social system existing in Ireland from the prehistoric period (500 BC or earlier) up until the Norman conquest (12th century AD), the bothach (\\"hut-dweller\\"), fuidir (perhaps linked to fot, \\"soil\\") and sencl√©ithe (\\"old dwelling-house\\") were low-ranked semi-free tenants similar to serfs. According to Laurence Ginnell, the sencl√©ithe and bothach \\"were not free to leave the territory except with permission, and in practice they usually served the flaith [prince]. They had no political or clan rights, could neither sue nor appear as witnesses, and were not free in the matter of entering into contracts. They could appear in a court of justice only in the name of the flaith or other person to whom they belonged, or whom they served, or by obtaining from an aire of the tuath to which they belonged permission to sue in his name.\\" A fuidir was defined by D. A. Binchy as \\"a \`tenant at will,' settled by the lord (flaith) on a portion of the latter's land; his services to the lord are always undefined. Although his condition is semi-servile, he retains the right to abandon his holding on giving due notice to the lord and surrendering to him two thirds of the products of his husbandry.\\" = Slaves = The last type of serf was the slave. Slaves had the fewest rights and benefits from the manor. They owned no tenancy in land, worked for the lord exclusively and survived on donations from the landlord. It was always in the interest of the lord to prove that a servile arrangement existed, as this provided him with greater rights to fees and taxes. The status of a man was a primary issue in determining a person's rights and obligations in many of the manorial court-cases of the period. Also, runaway slaves could be beaten if caught. The United States had approximately 4 million slaves by 1860, and the British Empire had 776,000 slaves when it abolished slavery in 1834.Historical survey > Ways of ending slavery. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The largest and longest lasting slave society in the Americas was Brazil, which in 1888 became the last American country to outlaw slavery. Duties Reeve and serfs in feudal England, c. 1310 The usual serf (not including slaves or cottars) paid his fees and taxes in the form of seasonally appropriate labour. Usually a portion of the week was devoted to ploughing his lord's fields held in demesne, harvesting crops, digging ditches, repairing fences, and often working in the manor house. The remainder of the serf's time he spent tending his own fields, crops and animals in order to provide for his family. Most manorial work was segregated by gender during the regular times of the year; however, during the harvest, the whole family was expected to work the fields. A major difficulty of a serf's life was that his work for his lord coincided with, and took precedence over, the work he had to perform on his own lands: when the lord's crops were ready to be harvested, so were his own. On the other hand, the serf of a benign lord could look forward to being well fed during his service; it was a lord without foresight who did not provide a substantial meal for his serfs during the harvest and planting times. In exchange for this work on the lord's demesne, the serfs had certain privileges and rights, including for example the right to gather deadwood ‚Äì an essential source of fuel ‚Äì from their lord's forests. In addition to service, a serf was required to pay certain taxes and fees. Taxes were based on the assessed value of his lands and holdings. Fees were usually paid in the form of agricultural produce rather than cash. The best ration of wheat from the serf's harvest often went to the landlord. Generally hunting and trapping of wild game by the serfs on the lord's property was prohibited. On Easter Sunday the peasant family perhaps might owe an extra dozen eggs, and at Christmas a goose was perhaps required too. When a family member died, extra taxes were paid to the lord as a form of feudal relief to enable the heir to keep the right to till what land he had. Any young woman who wished to marry a serf outside of her manor was forced to pay a fee for the right to leave her lord, and in compensation for her lost labour. Often there were arbitrary tests to judge the worthiness of their tax payments. A chicken, for example, might be required to be able to jump over a fence of a given height to be considered old enough or well enough to be valued for tax purposes. The restraints of serfdom on personal and economic choice were enforced through various forms of manorial customary law and the manorial administration and court baron. It was also a matter of discussion whether serfs could be required by law in times of war or conflict to fight for their lord's land and property. In the case of their lord's defeat, their own fate might be uncertain, so the serf certainly had an interest in supporting his lord. Rights Within his constraints, a serf had some freedoms. Though the common wisdom is that a serf owned \\"only his belly\\"even his clothes were the property, in law, of his lorda serf might still accumulate personal property and wealth, and some serfs became wealthier than their free neighbours, although this happened rarely. A well-to-do serf might even be able to buy his freedom. A serf could grow what crop he saw fit on his lands, although a serf's taxes often had to be paid in wheat. The surplus he would sell at market. The landlord could not dispossess his serfs without legal cause and was supposed to protect them from the depredations of robbers or other lords, and he was expected to support them by charity in times of famine. Many such rights were enforceable by the serf in the manorial court. Variations Forms of serfdom varied greatly through time and regions. In some places serfdom was merged with or exchanged for various forms of taxation. The amount of labour required varied. In Poland, for example, it was commonly a few days per year per household in the 13th century. One day per week per household in the 14th century. Four days per week per household in the 17th century. Six days per week per household in the 18th century. Early serfdom in Poland was mostly limited on the royal territories (kr√≥lewszczyzny). \\"Per household\\" means that every dwelling had to give a worker for the required number of days.Maria Bogucka, Bia≈Çog≈Çowa w dawnej Polsce, Warsaw, 1998, , p. 72 For example, in the 18th century, six people: a peasant, his wife, three children and a hired worker might be required to work for their lord one day a week, which would be counted as six days of labour. Serfs served on occasion as soldiers in the event of conflict and could earn freedom or even ennoblement for valour in combat. Serfs could purchase their freedom, be manumitted by generous owners, or flee to towns or to newly settled land where few questions were asked. Laws varied from country to country: in England a serf who made his way to a chartered town (i.e. a borough) and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom and became a burgher of the town.

The population was 15,285 at the 2010 census. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.91%, is water. The township is located in northern York County in south-central Pennsylvania. The Susquehanna River forms the eastern border of the township, and the western part of the township entirely surrounds the borough of Lewisberry. History Prior to the coming of the first settlers in 1736, Newberry Township was inhabited by the Susquehannock Indians. Before 1736, all settlement in Pennsylvania was kept east of the Susquehanna River, but the Indian Treaty of 1736 extended Lancaster County's boundary westward indefinitely. Quaker families from Lancaster and Chester counties immediately set out across the Susquehanna to find new land. These settlers utilized the Middletown Ferry to access the west bank of the river, and once they reached what is now Newberry Township, settled throughout the Fishing Creek and Bennetts Run valleys. Newberry Township was organized in 1742 and included what is now Fairview Township. Prior to the start of the Revolutionary War, the early Quaker settlers became dissatisfied with the quality of the farmland within Newberry Township and began moving out of it. German families from central York County, and Berks and Lancaster counties, soon arrived to take over the vacant farmland. By the late 18th century, several towns had sprung up throughout the township. Lewisberry and Newberrytown were early Quaker settlements. Newberrytown began as a tract of Quaker meeting land, with a log meetinghouse built in 1745. Later, a new meetinghouse was built halfway between Lewisberry and the Newberrytown meeting land, and the tract was developed as a town in 1791. Newberrytown was situated on the road from Lancaster to Carlisle (which crossed the Susquehanna River at the York Haven Ferry) and became an important stopping place along the way. Lewisberry was also surveyed and platted in the 1790s. Its stores became busy and prosperous. Schools were operated in both communities. Early settlers were also attracted to the vicinity of Yocumtown because of the water power of Fishing Creek. Along its banks they built fulling mills that carded wool for area farmers, woolen cloth mills, and grist mills. By the mid-1820s, the village of Yocumtown had established itself with a log schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, and a tannery. Goldsboro and York Haven prospered due to their location on the Susquehanna River and adjoining canal route. A ferry was also established at the site of Goldsboro in 1738. Both Goldsboro and the village of Cly were located along the important stagecoach route between York and Harrisburg, where a turnpike was completed between the two towns in 1816. The railroad, built in the late 1830s, also ran through Goldsboro. However, the village remained small through the first half of the 19th century. Hammersly- Strominger House built 1790 York Haven, also a ferry point, began as a flour milling town. In 1814, the York Haven Company, which built four large mills, prepared the town plan. Large hotels, dry goods and hardware stores, copper shops that manufactured flour barrels, and a sawmill all became part of the town‚Äôs healthy economy. Large keelboats of wheat were brought down the river to the mills in York Haven, then the flour was sent by wagon or canal to Baltimore. The town became a popular resort, with city boarders in the summer and gambling at the hotel. Early prosperity began to decline during the 1830s, when the Codorus Canal was completed into the town of York, luring business away from York Haven. The flour mills closed down but were later replaced with a paper mill. In 1803, Fairview Township was formed from the northern half of the original Newberry Township.

Local Venues  Former Opera House Red Lion, Pennsylvania has a rich musical heritage. It is the home of the Red Lion Felton band which was first started in 1932 as the Red Lion Concert Band and then later joined with the Felton Band in 1972. The band is composed of local musicians of all ages and performs at many community events. The Red Lion Area School District has also been awarded the NAMM Foundation's ‚ÄúBest Community for Music Education‚Äù from 2012 to 2018 which considers the quality of programs and availability of music education within the schools and community. Red Lion is also home to an extensive array of local underground bands and independent local artists, perhaps the most popular being Halestorm, who reached the top ten on the US Mainstream Rock charts and receives extensive local radio play. Red Lion also had a fully functional opera house and a downtown movie theater until the mid-1960s. The opera house has since been converted to housing, and the movie theater was demolished and is now a parking lot. Red Lion has many talented veteran and up and coming artists and musical talents of all genres (including funk, blues, jazz, bluegrass and country). The Guitar Spot USA and Tom's Music Trade are part of what's now known as a \\"Musician's Row\\" of sorts to local musicians and artists. Red Lion also has many housing developments that have sprung up over the last 15 years but none as famous (or infamous) as the Sage Hill development. The Sage Hill development prides itself on many things, one of which is the fact that the neighborhood drinks more beer in one weekend than most small towns do in a year! The neighborhood is also proud to be the home of the OMDT organization, a social club that now has over 20 members.

The population was 517 at the 2010 census. History The Seven Valleys basin was settled by forty families of the German Lutheran and Reformed faiths. They originated in the Hunsruck Mountains of the Rhineland Palatinate and arrived in this valley of the Codorus during the early fall of 1738. The lush meadows and gently rolling hills here reminded them of their homeland, even to the presence of seven valleys in the vicinity, and they called it Das Siebenthal, which in German means Seven Valleys. By 1752 these religious hardworking farmers had organized churches and parochial schools, and holding fast to their German heritage, worshipped God and taught their children in the Pfalzer dialect of the German language for nearly 150 years. Friedensaal Church about two miles south of town With the coming of the railroad in 1838 and the opportunity to trade commercially with the outside world, the use of the English language gradually crept into the culture and by the end of the Civil War the use of German slowly began fading into the background. In 1854 iron ore was discovered here and a great wave of prosperity swept the people of the valley : hell-bent-for-leather\\" on into their golden age of the late 19th and early 20th century. During the American Civil War, Seven Valleys served as an important stop along the North Central Railroad, and witnessed President Abraham Lincoln's funeral train pass by en route to Harrisburg.

The population was 2,167 at the 2010 census. The town is known for a strong smell associated with its paper mill. History The site of Spring Grove was laid out in 1747 on the banks of Codorus Creek, midway between York and Hanover, by a surveyor for the Penns. Its growth since that time falls into two periods, each lasting approximately 100 years. The first witnessed development of the borough as an iron-making center. The second, which extends to the present day, is as a papermaking center. The businesses of both periods have relied on certain natural resources of the area. Originally, Spring Grove was a part of Paradise Township and was contained within the boundaries of Lancaster County. York County was formed in 1749 and Jackson Township, including Spring Grove, in 1853. The residents of the community petitioned the County Court in 1882 for incorporation as a borough, and in August of that year their petition was granted. Since that time, the borough has grown in area as a result of annexation of the surrounding land, the largest annexation having taken place in 1953. In the 1770s, attracted by the presence of water, iron ore and wood for charcoal in the Pigeon Hills, an iron manufacturer established a forge at \\"Spring Forge\\". It is known as Spring Grove. The early German and English woodchoppers who flocked to this first Pennsylvania iron industry west of the Susquehanna River were the forebears of today's community. By the mid-19th century, the manufacturing of iron had grown to a point where almost of iron bar were produced locally each year. By 1851, however, the iron business had been suspended, and its buildings were converted to the manufacturing of paper. Once again local resources, wood and water, were largely responsible for the location of this industry in the Spring Grove area. Thirteen years later, the plant was purchased by P. H. Glatfelter for $14,000. Other basic industries, such as brick-making and the manufacture of explosives, have from time to time established themselves in the borough. None, however, have remained as long nor have been as successful as the paper mill. Since 1865, the growth of the borough has reflected growth of the Glatfelter Paper Mill. In August 2018, Glatfelder announced an agreement to sell its Specialty Papers division, which includes the Spring Grove mill, to private investment firm Lindsay Goldberg for $360 million, with the sale to close before 2019. Mill operations are expected to continue. The Spring Grove Borough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

The population was 2,089 at the 2010 census. History There were settlers in the Stewartstown area as early as 1750. This part of southern York County was claimed by both Maryland and Pennsylvania, and the boundary dispute was settled by the surveying of the Mason‚ÄìDixon Line in 1767. By 1777, a road had been well established between York and Baltimore, and Stewartstown's main street of today lies along a portion of the road. Around 1812, a group of farmers set out to establish a town in south central Hopewell Township. The earliest buildings were several houses, a workshop for making furniture and wheels, a store, and a tavern. Anthony Stewart, owner of the workshop, served as the village clerk, and his shop became the main meeting place. The village was first known as Meadstown, after Benedict Meads, owner of the tavern and the store. Later it became known as Mechanicsburg because of a large amount of tradesmen who lived in the community. By 1828, the town had its own post office, and Stewart was appointed the first postmaster. There was already another Pennsylvania town named Mechanicsburg, so postal officials assigned the name \\"Guilford\\" to the community. Through the efforts of Anthony Stewart, with the help of Judge Adam Ebaugh, the Post Office Department changed the town's postmark to \\"Stewartstown\\" on March 24, 1832.

History Windsor Township was originally a part of Hellam Township, which was the original township of York County laid out by authority of the Provincial court at Lancaster in 1739. Windsor remained a part of Hellam Township until 1753 when a petition was presented to the court at York, signed by John Wright, Jr. asking that ‚ÄúHallam Township be divided by a line on Stony Ridge, running across the valley to the next ridge of hills on the south side of Grist (Kreutz) Creek Valley, and also eastward along the last named ridge to the river Susquehanna.‚Äù This new township, York, included the current townships of Windsor, Lower Windsor, York and a portion of Spring Garden. Five years later, Windsor Township (which included Lower Windsor Township) formed out of York Township. In April 1758, the following petition was presented at the April session of court: ‚ÄúWe, your humble petitioners, hereby state that when the Townships of York and Hallam were in one, a division line was obtained which did not prove convenient or satisfactory; therefore we request that commissioners be appointed by your worshipfuls to lay off the new township.‚Äù The presiding justice, Thomas Armor, then appointed John Shultz, John Schyrack, Christian Shank and Michael Bart, to view and run the boundary line which was as follows: : Beginning at the plantation of Peter Peterman, thence with the road to David Hunter‚Äôs, thence with the same to Shrewsbury Township (now Springfield and Hopewell), thence with the same township and the township of Chanceford to the Susquehanna, and up the same to Hallam Township, thence along the middle of that ridge of hills to Peter Peterman‚Äôs plantation and place of beginning, which last described township is to be called by the name of Windsor.Gibson, John, Editor.

History  Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge in 2014 (foreground) According to a plaque at Samuel S. Lewis State Park, which overlooks Wrightsville and the Susquehanna River, Wrightsville was among George Washington's choices as the location of the capital of the United States. The world's longest covered bridge, at , once spanned the Susquehanna from Wrightsville to neighboring Columbia in Lancaster County. Built in 1814, it was destroyed by high water and ice in 1832. A replacement bridge was burned the night of June 28, 1863, by state militia during the Gettysburg Campaign in the American Civil War. Confederate troops under John Brown Gordon formed a bucket brigade to save the town from fire. Yet another replacement covered bridge was destroyed by a windstorm a few years later. The final bridge, the Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge, was a steel open-air bridge constructed in 1896. It was razed in the early 1960s because of obsolescence and restructuring of the railroad industry. Wrightsville was the northern terminus of the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal, which extended to Havre de Grace, Maryland. In 2007, Wrightsville was the chosen location for the rekindling of the War of the Roses between the York Revolution and the Lancaster Barnstormers baseball teams.

The population was 5,405 at the 2010 census. Jamestown is situated almost entirely on Conanicut Island, the second largest island in Narragansett Bay. It also includes the uninhabited Dutch Island and Gould Island. Jamestown is ranked as the 444th wealthiest place to live in the United States as of 2016, with a median home sale price of $1,229,039. Geography Newport Bridge connects Jamestown with Newport, a city on Aquidneck Island According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which is land and is water. The total area is 72.55% water. Rhode Island Route 138 is the only state highway in Jamestown, connecting the town and island to North Kingstown to the west (over the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge) and Newport to the east (over the Newport Bridge). History In 1524, Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano and his crew visited Narragansett Bay. Dutch Island was used by fur traders , and English colonists made arrangements to use Conanicut Island for grazing sheep in 1638. The original Jamestown Bridge, which connected Jamestown with North Kingstown, Rhode Island from 1940 until its demolition in 2006 Ferries were in operation between Conanicut Island and Newport by 1675. In 1678, Conanicut Island was incorporated as the town of Jamestown, when there were about 150 residents. It was named for James, Duke of York, who became King James II in 1685. By 1710, many of Conanicut Island's current roads were in place. In 1728, the town of Jamestown built a windmill for grinding corn, which used the sea breeze for power since there was no source of running water to turn a waterwheel. American Revolution Two hundred British and Hessian troops, commanded by James Wallace, landed at East Ferry on Conanicut Island on December 10, 1775. They then marched to West Ferry where they burned the ferry house. As they returned to East Ferry, they destroyed many buildings, including 14 homes, which caused more than 200 of Conanicut Island's 556 residents to flee to the mainland. In December 1776, a British fleet arrived in Narragansett Bay and occupied Newport. The British took over the colonial militia batteries at Fort Dumpling (now part of Fort Wetherill) and the Conanicut Battery at Beavertail, just south of Fort Getty at the end of Battery Lane. They left Narragansett Bay in October 1779; as they departed, they destroyed the fortifications which they had occupied and burned down the Beavertail Lighthouse. 18th and 19th centuries Beavertail Lighthouse was back in operation by 1784, and Jamestown rebuilt the Jamestown Windmill and Quaker Meetinghouse in 1787 that had been destroyed during the occupation. In 1800, Fort Dumpling was established on the site of previous fortifications overlooking East Passage. A tall stone tower atop the highest cliff could hold eight guns. The town of Jamestown commissioned a steam-powered ferryboat in 1872 and initiated service between Jamestown and Newport in May 1873. The availability of reliable and comfortable ferry service to and from Newport had a significant impact on agricultural Conanicut Island, and Jamestown became a destination for both day trips and summer vacations. The 1880s and 1890s saw a construction boom, with hotels, private summer homes, and municipal buildings going up. The island's population tripled between 1870 and 1900. 20th century to the present There was a burst of military fortification activity from 1890 to the end of World War I. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was a catalyst, beginning in 1898, and work began on Dutch Island's Fort Greble. The War Department bought for Fort Getty, and fortifications were quickly erected. Summer homes were condemned near Fort Dumpling to establish Fort Wetherill. More land was acquired at Prospect Hill near the Conanicut Battery site for an observation and fire control station, and the government established a torpedo station and test facility on Gould Island. Then, at the end of the First World War, the Conanicut Island fortifications fell into disuse. World War II brought establishment or reactivation of military bases around Narragansett Bay, including Forts Getty, Burnside, and Wetherill on Conanicut Island, Fort Greble on Dutch Island, a torpedo factory on Goat Island, and a torpedo station on Gould Island. The Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge, constructed in 1992, connects Jamestown with mainland Rhode Island Jamestown was a bustling summer destination in the early 1900s, and it had nine hotels in 1903. The golden age of large resort hotels was brief, however, in Jamestown and elsewhere, and patronage rapidly declined in the 1920s. The Thorndike Hotel was demolished in 1938. The Gardner House was one of the larger hotels, but it was taken down in 1941 after being idle for several years, and a USO building was built on its site. After the war, the town purchased the building and it is now known as the community center. It was extensively landscaped and remodeled in 2002. The Bay View Hotel closed in the 1960s, the last of the very large hotels. The building was demolished in 1985, and the Bay View Condominiums opened for occupancy four years later. The building exterior was designed to resemble the hotel. The Bay Voyage Hotel is the only survivor of the many hotels that once lined Jamestown's eastern harbor, now operating as a time share resort. In 1938, a major hurricane caused much property damage and the loss of more than 300 lives in the Narragansett Bay region. It swept away much of the sand from the Mackerel Cove beach, destroyed its popular beach pavilion, and destroyed the West Ferry docks‚Äîwhich actually speeded approvals for a bridge to Saunderstown. The first Jamestown Bridge opened in the summer of 1940, replacing West Ferry service with a continuously available link to the west. In 1969, the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge was completed, establishing Route 138 as a continuous highway from South County to Newport. With its completion, traditional ferry service was eliminated. The bridge is pictured on the Rhode Island commemorative quarters. In 1992, the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge replaced the narrow steel bridge erected in 1940. It was accompanied by construction of a new western-end access road and a cross-Conanicut Island highway.

History Little Compton was originally inhabited by the Sakonnet Indians. The name has been interpreted in a variety of ways including \\"where the water pours forth\\". The first Colonial settlers in Little Compton were from Duxbury, Massachusetts in the Plymouth Colony, which granted them their charter. They divided the land into standard-sized lots and settled there. Among these 29 original proprietors was Colonel Benjamin Church, who would become well known for his role in the late 17th-century conflicts with surrounding Indian tribes, initially the Wampanoags and later, the Narragansetts. In 1675, Church built a house in Little Compton, just prior to King Philip's War. Today, a plaque marks the location on West Main Road. In 1682, Sakonnet was incorporated by the Plymouth Colony and was renamed Little Compton, probably in reference to Cullompton, Devon, England. After the \\"Old Colony\\" was merged into the Massachusetts Bay Colony to the north, a local colonial representative to the General Court in Boston boasted that all the stone walls in Little Compton would stretch to the State House and back, if laid end to end. A Royal commission changed the state border in 1747, and Little Compton along with Tiverton and Bristol became part of Rhode Island. All probate and land records prior to 1746 are kept in Taunton and New Bedford, Massachusetts. Beginning in the late Victorian era, the town became a destination for summer visitors drawn to its beaches and farms seemingly untouched by modernity, and for its relatively cool, maritime climate. Wilbor House, built in 1692, is now a museum Sites of historic interest in Little Compton include the Wilbor House, built in 1692 by Samuel Wilbore and now the home of the Little Compton Historical Society. The entire town commons is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. There are about 57 historic cemeteries in the town. Benjamin Church and his family are buried in the Little Compton Commons cemetery, as is Elizabeth Pabodie, the eldest daughter of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins of Mayflower fame. The stones in the cemetery reflect a style of carving similar to that found both in Newport and in Boston during the same time period. Little Compton is home to one of only three town commons in Rhode Island. The others are in Bristol and Warren. Land for the common was designated in August 1677 and has been used ever since as both a religious and civic center, the location of churches, a school, the town hall, town library, and other government buildings and civic institutions. The Commons contain a large cemetery. The Commons and other town owned properties are described in the essay, \\"In Search of the Commons\\" by Steven Lubar of The Little Compton Historical Society.In Search of The Commons, part of A National Conversation Hosted by the Smithsonian and Arizona State University, Zoloco Public Square. Another distinctive feature of the town is the circa 1905 \\"Spite Tower\\" found in the hamlet of Adamsville. Built as a water tower, local lore claims that it was constructed to obscure the sightlines of a rival abutting neighbor. Fort Church was built near Sakonnet Point during World War II and was named for Benjamin Church. The largest of the four batteries was Battery Gray with two 16-inch guns, an area that became the Sakonnet Golf Club.

Agricultural Conservancy Trust Little Compton is unique for its real estate transfer tax, which was enabled by state statute in 1985 to preserve farmland in town and protect limited drinking water resources from overdevelopment.Little Compton Agricultural Conservancy Trust: History, Structure and How We Are Financed Effective July 1, 2016, real estate property transfers are taxed at a 4% rate (the first $300,000 is exempted), paid by the buyer in the transaction to the town's Agricultural Conservancy Trust. Education There is only one school in Little Compton, the Wilbur and McMahon school. It was originally known as the Josephine Wilbur (or central) school. It had 12 classrooms and housed the town's K-12 facilities. It was renamed after additions were built in the mid 1900s. Approximately 350 students attend classes in Kindergarten through 8th grade. Located in the center of town, the residents simply refer to it as \\"Wilbur School.\\" High school students usually attend Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, RI. Rhode Island Red The Rhode Island Red is a native breed of poultry first bred in Adamsville, a hamlet that is part of Little Compton. According to The Livestock Conservancy, \\"The Rhode Island Red is not only America's best known breed, but is perhaps the world's best known fowl. It is the most successful dual purpose bird [raised for both eggs and meat], and remains an excellent farm chicken [or non-industrial breed].\\"Rhode Island Red The Livestock Conservancy In 1925, the Rhode Island Red Club of America donated funds for a monument to the Rhode Island Red in Adamsville, at the intersection of Main Street and Westport River Road. A competing monument to the Rhode Island Red was erected by the state in 1954, south of Adamsville. The two memorials reflect the dispute between poultry fanciers and farmers over who should have received credit for the breed's success.

The population was 16,150 at the 2010 census. It lies to the south of Portsmouth and to the north of Newport on Aquidneck Island, hence the name \\"Middletown\\". History Various issues including unjust taxation and a growing population caused the freeholders living in the northern section of Newport to petition the general assembly for independence. As a result of the petition, the land that Middletown occupies was set apart in 1731. The town was incorporated in 1743. During the 1980s, large sections of East Main Road and West Main Road running through Middletown began to be commercialized, and by the late 1990s, the area had become Aquidneck Island's central business district.

The population was 47,037 at the 2010 census, making it the fifth-largest city in the state. Geography East Providence is located between the Providence and Seekonk Rivers on the west and the Seekonk area of Massachusetts on the east. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (19.33%) is water. The following villages are located in East Providence:RIGIS Villages data layer * East Providence Center * Riverside * Rumford  History  In 1641, the Plymouth Colony purchased from the Indians a large tract of land which today includes the northern half of East Providence (from Watchemoket to Rumford), Rehoboth, Massachusetts, Seekonk, Massachusetts, and part of Pawtucket. Four years later, John Brown of Plymouth bought a considerably smaller piece of land from the Indians, which today comprises the southern part of East Providence (Riverside), Barrington, and a small part of Swansea. Finally, in 1661, Plymouth completed the \\"North Purchase\\" from which Attleboro, North Attleboro, and Cumberland were later formed. Over the whole the authorities gave the name \\"Rehoboth\\". The center of this large settlement, which is sometimes referred to as \\"Old Rehoboth\\", is within the borders of modern East Providence. In 1812, the western half of Old Rehoboth was set off as a separate township called Seekonk, Massachusetts. Old Rehoboth's town center now became the heart of Old Seekonk. Finally, in 1862, the western part of Old Seekonk was ceded to Rhode Island and incorporated as East Providence. Portuguese immigration A Portuguese restaurant in East Providence Beginning around 1900 and continuing until the onset of the Great Depression in 1930, large numbers of Portuguese immigrants and descendants from Providence, Fall River, New Bedford, and Portugal settled in East Providence. By 1905, there were over 400 Portuguese in the town, the third-highest in the state. The Portuguese, like other ethnic groups, were drawn to East Providence primarily by the lure of jobs. Many employment opportunities were available in the Watchemoket area, where numerous immigrants settled. Watchemoket Square Former Industrial National Bank building at Watchemoket Square Oddfellows Hall in Watchemoket Square In decades preceding the Civil War, Watchemoket Point was little more than a farming and fishing area with perhaps a few hundred residents. Watchemoket was situated directly across from the thriving city of Providence and thus benefited from the expansion of that community. More importantly, two bridges across the Seekonk River gave easy access to Watchmemoket. By the 1860s, tolls were no longer being charged to cross the Washington and Central Bridges, giving further stimulus to the growth of Watchemoket and the transformation of the village from a sleepy fishing area to the vital core of East Providence in 1862. Perhaps the first businesses to come to Watchemoket were inns built to service the large numbers of people coming through. The residents of Watchemoket also had their own library by the early 1870s. At first the organizers named it Ladies Library Association, but in 1885 they changed the named to Watchemoket Free Public Library. Already the commercial and population center of East Providence, by the mid-1880s, Watchemoket next became the political center as well. The town hall was moved from Rumford to the heart of the community, so it was more accessible. They purchased a lot on Taunton Avenue for $11,500 and erected a two-story brick building which opened in 1889. That same year the East Providence Police Department opened its headquarters in the town hall. By 1922, Watchemoket Square was the heart of downtown East Providence, supporting over 100 businesses including two department stores, two restaurants, five barber shops, bakeries, and blacksmith shops. Ingraham Hall was village's centerpiece, featuring a concert hall on the second floor and shopping on the first. Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show performed at Ingraham Hall when it came to Rhode Island. An Industrial National Bank branch opened in 1923 with much publicity. Piers lined Narragansett Bay; in 1880, 473 ships docked at Watchemoket unloading 256,000 tons of coal. However, the neighborhood began a decline when the Washington Bridge drew traffic south of the area in 1927. Then the Hurricane of 1938 demolished the local oyster population. In 1955 Interstate 195 was built through the heart of Watchemoket, resulting in the northern half of the square to be demolished. Buildings which remain include the bank (now a comedy club), St. Mary's Episcopal Church, and Oddfellows' Hall. Rumford For some time after the incorporation of the town in 1862, the area around the old \\"Ring of the Green\\" was referred to as East Providence Center. The official town hall was located here until 1889, as were several churches. Moreover, the village was the population center of East Providence, containing many farms and mills along the Ten Mile River. Many people migrated from East Providence Center to the new center at Watchemoket. Riverside The old Riverside station on the East Bay Bike Path From the time of the Wannamoisett purchase in 1645 to the Civil War, the shore land from Watchemoket to Bullocks Point had remained a sparsely settled fishing and farming area. When East Providence was incorporated, no more than a few hundred of its residents made the coastal village their home. The white settlers had first learned of the plentiful supply of shellfish in the area from the Wampanoag Indians. More than two centuries later, the waters of Narragansett Bay, which washed the shores of Wannamoisett, still contained an abundant supply of edible sea treasures. Clams, quahogs, and oysters were harvested by Wannamoisett residents and sold in Providence. Arnold Medberry, for instance, brought his plow to the shoreline and began picking up clams by the handful. He loaded the shellfish on a cart and easily sold his entire day's catch in Providence. At that time, Medberry and his neighbors were referred to as \\"clamdiggers\\", a derogatory term comparable to the pejorative hayseed. Already, by the early nineteenth century, individuals had begun to build summer homes, causing the population to double to about 500‚Äì600. During that time period, Cedar Grove, Lewis Station, Chimney Corners, Peck's Corner, Pleasant Bluffs, Sabin's Point, Sherman's Station, and Pomham were developed. New resort facilities were built, such as the Pomham House. Numbers of roads were lined with trees and houses, Christian churches were formed, a library was built, and the Narragansett Engine Company was formed in 1878. By that time, the residents were no longer dismissed as \\"clamdiggers\\", but regarded as townspeople. Charles Looff and family at the Crescent Park Looff Carousel, c. 1905 While many transactions were taking place, Charles I. D. Looff came to Riverside. He was a wood carver for a furniture business in New York, and spent spare time in his basement carving wooden horses as a hobby. After long years of hard work, he produced the first steam-powered carousel and sold it to Crescent Park. He operated the carousel and designed a summer recreation area. By the early 1900s, New Englanders recognized Crescent Park as the leading amusement park in the region. Looff accomplished fantastic achievements and, after his death, his family continued to operate Crescent Park. The park closed in the 1970s and the land was used for condominiums, apartments and single-family homes. The Crescent Park Looff Carousel still remains.

The population was 4,606 at the 2010 census.  History  Foster was originally settled in the 17th century by British colonists as a farming community. In the year 1662, William Vaughan, Zachariah Rhodes, and Robert Wescott, purchased of the Indians a large tract of land called West Quanaug, bordering on Providence. The 'West Quanaug purchase', consisted of nearly the whole southern half of the town of Foster. The first settler was allegedly Ezekiel Hopkins. Many settlers from Newport were active in the town in the 18th century. Shortly before the incorporation of the town, Foster's first church, a Calvinist Baptist congregation was founded. Shortly afterwards, Six Principle Baptist and Free Will Baptist congregations were founded. Foster was incorporated with Scituate, Rhode Island in 1730, forming the western section of that township, and remained part of Scituate until 1781, when it was split off as a distinct and separate township. Foster derived its name, from U.S. Senator Theodore Foster. Mr. Foster presented the town with a library. Some of the library's original books and town records are still preserved. U.S. Senator Nelson Aldrich was born in Foster in 1841. Senator Aldrich was instrumental in starting the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. In the 1920s the Ku Klux Klan was active in the area, and one of the largest Klan rallies in the state was held in Foster on the Old Home Day grounds in 1924 with 8,000 in attendance and U.S. Senator J.

The population was 4,577 at the 2010 census. Pascoag is one of eight villages that make up the town of Burrillville. Geography Pascoag is located at (41.957401, -71.705957). The village is centered on the Pascoag River at its outlet from the Pascoag Reservoir. The river drops through the village, providing ample power for industry in the village's early days. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 5.5 square miles; 5 square miles is land and 0.4 square miles (7.88%) is water. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 4,742 people, 1,642 households, and 1,175 families residing in the village. The racial makeup was 98.33% White, 0.36% African American, 0.32% American Indian, 0.27% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.17% from other races, and 0.53% from two or more races.

The median income for a household was $48,778, and the median income for a family was $54,391. History The name of Burrillville's principal village, Pascoag, named after the stream upon which it is located, probably derives from an Algonquian Indian root. The Nipmuc word for snake was rendered \\"askug\\" by Roger Williams in his A Key Into the Language of America, and \\"askoog\\" by the Reverend John Eliot in his Algonquian translation of the Bible. Wallum Lake station in Pascoag in 1909 Pascoag can trace its origins back to the first half of the 18th century, when a saw mill and other businesses were built in what is now the village center. In the 19th century, Pascoag became a textile manufacturing town, an industry that continued until after World War II. From 1891 until the 1930s the Woonsocket and Pascoag Railroad operated trains to Pascoag, but the line (currently operated by the Providence and Worcester Railroad) now terminates in Slatersville. The horror author H. P. Lovecraft set part of his story \\"The Horror at Red Hook\\" (1925) in Pascoag. Recent history includes an incident involving groundwater contamination. A test of the groundwater conducted on September 14, 2001, showed that the water contained the ether MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) at levels of over 350 ppb (parts per billion). This was the first public statement concerning the presence of MTBE in Pascoag drinking water, though residents claim to have detected it as early as May 2001. MTBE is a gasoline additive intended to enhance octane levels. It is believed to have come from leaking tanks at a local Exxon Mobil gas station. As the situation was resolved over the following months, nearly 1,500 residents of Pascoag responded by filing a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil through the law offices of Napoli, Kaiser, and Bern and Houston attorney Armistead Easterby. Exxon Mobil signed off on a $7 million settlement with residents of Pascoag in May 2012, to cover the cost of having the Pascoag Public Utility District bore new wells.

The population was 71,148 at the 2010 census. It is the fourth largest city in the state. Pawtucket borders Providence, Central Falls, North Providence, Lincoln, and East Providence in Rhode Island and Seekonk and Attleboro in the state of Massachusetts. Name The name \\"Pawtucket\\" comes from the Algonquian word for \\"river fall.\\" History The Pawtucket region was said to have been one of the most populous places in New England prior to the arrival of European settlers. Native Americans would gather here to take advantage of the salmon and smaller fish which gathered at the falls. The first European settler here was Joseph Jenks, who came to the region from Lynn, Massachusetts. He purchased about 60 acres near Pawtucket Falls in 1671. He established a sawmill and forge. These, along with the entire town, were later destroyed during King Philip's War. Other settlers followed Jenks, and by 1775 the area was home to manufacturers of muskets, linseed oil, potash, and ship building. Also around this time Oziel Wilkinson and his family set up an iron forge making anchors, nails, screws, farm implements, and even cannons. Panoramic map of Pawtucket and Central Falls (1877) Pawtucket was an early and important center of cotton textiles during the American Industrial Revolution. Slater Mill, built in 1793 by Samuel Slater on the Blackstone River falls in downtown Pawtucket, was the first fully mechanized cotton-spinning mill in America. Slater Mill is known for developing a commercially successful production process not reliant on earlier horse-drawn processes developed in America. Slater constructed and operated machines for producing yarn. Other manufacturers continued, transforming Pawtucket into a center for textiles, iron working, and other products. By the 1920s, Pawtucket was a prosperous mill town. The city had over a half-dozen movie theaters, two dozen hotels, and an impressive collection of fine commercial and residential architecture. Perhaps the most impressive public building in Pawtucket was the Leroy Theatre, an ornate movie palace that was called \\"Pawtucket's Million Dollar Theater\\". Many wealthy mill owners such as Darius Goff built their mansions in the area. The textile business in New England declined during the Great Depression with many manufacturers closing or moving their facilities South where operations and labor were cheaper. Later in the 20th Century, Pawtucket began to lose some of its architectural heritage to the wrecking ball, including the Leroy Theatre. But unlike numerous older mill towns in the region, Pawtucket retained much of its industrial base. Today, goods produced in the city include lace, non-woven and elastic woven materials, jewelry, silverware, metals, and textiles. Hasbro, one of the world's largest manufacturers of toys and games, is headquartered in Pawtucket.

East of the Blackstone River was originally settled as part of the Massachusetts town of Rehoboth. The first Pawtucket to be incorporated was in 1828 when Rehoboth gave up their land and Pawtucket became a new town in Massachusetts. In 1862 the eastern portion was absorbed into Providence County, Rhode Island. On March 1, 1862, after a nearly 225-year border dispute between Rhode Island and Plymouth/Massachusetts, the area of Pawtucket and East Providence was shifted into Rhode Island, and the new border remains to this day. In 1874, the land west of the river was taken from North Providence and added to the town of Pawtucket, but acted as two different towns. Finally in 1886, West and East Pawtucket were merged and the city was incorporated. Geography Pawtucket is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (2.89%) is water. Pawtucket lies within three drainage basins. These include the Blackstone River (including the Seekonk River), the Moshassuck River and the Ten Mile River. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 71,141 people, 32,055 households, and 18,508 families residing in the city.

Like nearby cities Providence, R.I., Fall River, Mass., and New Bedford, Mass., Pawtucket hosts a significant population from across the former Portuguese Empire (11.6%) plus an extremely significant Cape Verdean population. The segment from Cape Verde Islands was featured in this Zip Code USA article from National Geographic magazine. Pawtucket is also one of the few areas of the United States with a significant Liberian population, mostly refugees from Charles Taylor's regime. Rhode Island has the highest per capita Liberian population in the country. Pawtucket has a high concentration of West Africans. Arts and culture Pawtucket Armory Center for the Arts (former Pawtucket Armory), with The Sandra Feinstein-Gamm Theatre in annex The City of Pawtucket has been supportive of the Arts Community since 1975. On September 2, 1977, The Beach Boys performed a concert at Narragansett Park attended by 40,000 people, the largest concert audience in Rhode Island history. In 2017, music historians Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise were successful in getting the street where the concert stage stood (the corner of 455 Narragansett Park Drive) officially renamed as \\"Beach Boys Way\\". The American- French Genealogical Society was founded in Pawtucket in 1978. In 1998, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a law creating a 307-acre Arts and Entertainment District in the City's historic downtown . Over the past decades various organizations have been active in continuing that support of the local arts community and beyond. In January, 1999, Herb Weiss, of the Planning Department, was hired to oversee the City's newly created Arts District. Through the support of then Mayor James E. Doyle and Planning Department Michael Cassidy, Weiss brought significant recognition for Pawtucket-Arts oriented development strategy . Mayor Doyle and Arts Czar Weiss hired researcher Ann Galligan, of Northeastern University, to create an arts and cultural plan. Over the years Pawtucket has become known as a center for arts and culture . Several experimental/indie rock bands have recorded albums at Machines with Magnets, a recording studio and art gallery in Downtown Pawtucket. Bands that have performed or recorded here include Battles, Lightning Bolt, Brown Bird, and Fang Island. The success of the works was seen in nationwide publicity in publications such as New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , Christian Scientist Monitor . Pawtucket even found itself named in Art Calendar's \\"Ten Great Towns for Working Arts.\\"Pawtucket‚Äôs transformation into an arts community is chronicled in a 53 minute documentary in 2008, Pawtucket Rising, produced by Jason Caminiti, a Fall River film maker, documenting the City‚Äôs successful efforts in bringing artist and cultural activities to blighted areas Pawtucket Rising.

The \\"Saints and Lady Saints\\" are very successful in sports including baseball, football, basketball, and softball. St. Raphael Academy is a rival of William E. Tolman. They took part in a Thanksgiving Day football game that was played in McCoy Stadium for over 70 years. This game is no longer played, as William E. Tolman now competes annually against its fellow Pawtucket public high school Charles E. Shea, rather than against St. Raphael Academy, a private Catholic high school. Pawtucket was home to Bishop Keough High School, a small all-girls catholic high school in the Fairlawn neighborhood. The city also has three Catholic elementary schools: St. Cecilia School, St. Teresa School and Woodlawn Catholic Regional School. Infrastructure The Old Post Office, Pawtucket Transportation Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and the MBTA's Providence/Stoughton Line run through Pawtucket, though there is no stop for either in the city. Train service at the Pawtucket/Central Falls train station terminated in 1959. Recently there have been discussions to have the \\"T\\" stop in Pawtucket at the old train station (which would be substantially refurbished) or at a platform elsewhere on the line. Federal funding has been provided for preliminary planning of a MBTA station in the city, with a request for proposals expected in early 2011. Commuters can board MBTA trains at the South Attleboro stop, off Newport Avenue just over the state line. The MBTA operates a layover facility in Pawtucket for trains on the Providence/Stoughton Line where the trains are kept overnight. The closest Amtrak station to Pawtucket is Providence Station. Public bus transportation is available in the city. RIPTA operates a hub in downtown Pawtucket with routes to various parts of the city and to parts of nearby towns. Riders can also access RIPTA buses to Providence at the downtown hub on the Smithfield Avenue (#53) and Beverage Hill (#78) routes; as well as on either the R-Line (Broad-North Main) Rapid Service route or #1 (Hope/Eddy) Key Corridor route. The # 1 (Hope/Eddy) Key Corridor route provides service from the Downtown Pawtucket hub north to the MBTA Station at South Attleboro, Mass. and south to T.F. Green Airport in Warwick. At Kennedy Plaza, Providence's hub, riders can access routes to most parts of the state. Highways and roads Interstate 95 and U.S. 1 also traverse the western part of Pawtucket. Some of the slowest posted speeds on I-95 are in the city due to the \\"S-curves\\" near downtown. To preserve certain buildings in the city, planners snaked I-95, creating sharp bends in the highway. Downtown Circulator Pawtucket's Downtown Circulator was a one-way loop through downtown; it is similar to British concepts of ring roads. A similar concept was also tried in Providence. The circulator used East Avenue, High Street, Summer Street, Goff Avenue, Dexter Street and Park Place West. Each half of the Circulator carried one direction of U.S. 1; sections also carried westbound RI 15 and northbound RI 114. It was signed with a big \\"C\\" on overhead signs. The circulator is no longer signed, though the road configuration remains. Providence's Downtown Ring Roads have suffered a similar fate.

Many Healthcare, Retail and Insurance companies are headquartered in Pawtucket. Fox Point Pickles, a pickling company, is headquartered in Pawtucket.  Notable people In popular culture * Pawtucket has been frequently referenced in the cartoon series Family Guy, specifically the \\"Pawtucket Brewery\\", Peter Griffin's place of work from Season 4 onwards, the character \\"Pawtucket Pat\\" and the beer \\"Pawtucket Patriot\\", though no brewery existed in the real Pawtucket when the show first made references to them. The toy company Peter Griffin worked for early in the series was called the Happy-Go- Lucky Toy Co, the name a loose parody based on the name of the Hasbro toy company based in Pawtucket. In general, there is a strong argument Pawtucket is the basis for the town of Quahog on the show. *In the 1999 film Outside Providence, the movie's main character, Tim Dunphy, grew up in Pawtucket. Many different Pawtucket locations are seen in the movie, including the police station. * American Buffalo, a 1996 film, was filmed in Pawtucket. * In December 1993, a character on the NBC sitcom Nurses called Pawtucket a pit.

The population was 10,329 at the 2010 census. History Scituate was first settled in 1710 by emigrants from Scituate, Massachusetts. The original spelling of the town's name was \\"Satuit\\", a native Indian word meaning \\"cold brook\\" or \\"cold river.\\" The town was a part of Providence until 1731. Scituate's first town meeting was held at the Angell Tavern in South Scituate, with Stephen Hopkins elected as the first moderator and Joseph Brown as clerk. Stephen Hopkins later became a governor of Rhode Island and was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His brother, Esek Hopkins, was Commander in Chief of the Continental Navy beginning in 1776. In 1788 Scituate representative, militia general and Supreme Court Justice William West led an armed anti-federalist mob of farmers into Providence to protest the U.S. Constitution. The Vernon family and arms, by Harrison Ellery, with additions and corrections by Thomas Vernon In 1791 the U.S. Supreme Court decided its first case, West v. Barnes, regarding a farm in Scituate. Scituate was once made up of a multitude of small villages, including North Scituate, Hope, Ashland, Clayville, Elmdale, Fiskeville, Glenn Rock, Harrisdale, Jackson, Kent, Ponaganset, Potterville, Richmond, Rockland, Saundersville, and South Scituate. Foster was incorporated as a separate town in 1781, taking the western half of Scituate. In 1915, the Rhode Island General Assembly voted to take of land in Scituate (38% of the town) to create a reservoir to supply fresh water to greater Providence. This project resulted in the condemnation of \\"1,195 buildings, including 375 houses, seven schools, six churches, six mills, thirty dairy farms, eleven ice houses, post offices, and an electric railway system, the Providence and Danielson Railway system\\". (2) The hamlets of Kent, Richmond, Rockland, South Scituate, Ashland, Saundersville, Ponaganset and parts of North Scituate and Clayville disappeared forever. Scituate has played an important role in many of the United States wars. During the Revolutionary War, 76 cannons were forged at the Hope Furnace in the village of Hope in southern Scituate. During World War II, a Federal Communications Commission Radio Intelligence Division monitoring facility on Darby Road near Chopmist Hill () intercepted German HF communications. Because of this, in 1946, the Chopmist Hill area was considered as a candidate for the location of the headquarters of the United Nations.BBC On This Day  24 October 1945: United Nations Organisation is bornhttp://www.quahog.org/factsfolklore/index.php?id=5 Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 54.8 square miles (141.9 km2), of which, 48.7 square miles (126.1 km2) of it is land and 6.1 square miles (15.8 km2) of it (11.15%) is water. Scituate Reservoir The Hope Dam on the Pawtuxet River One of the most prominent features of the town is the Scituate Reservoir. The large reservoir spans a large portion of Scituate and has forever changed the face of the town. During construction of the reservoir, numerous villages were flooded along the former banks of the Pawtuxet River. Some foundations of the old structures are still visible today during times of drought. The reservoir, and a large portion of land surrounding, it is owned and maintained by the Providence Water Supply Board. The main Scituate reservoir was formed by the construction of a dam across the Pawtuxet River at the former village of Kent. The dam, principally of earth, is about long and high. Water storage in the reservoir began on November 10, 1925. An aqueduct from the dam feeds the nearby treatment plant which was placed in operation on September 30, 1926. The Scituate Reservoir is the largest artificial freshwater body of water in the state of Rhode Island. It has an aggregate capacity of and a surface area of . It and its six tributary reservoirs‚Äîwhich make up a total surface area of ‚Äîsupply drinking water to more than 60 percent of the state population. The surrounding drainage basin that provides water to the reservoir system covers an area of about , which includes most of the town of Scituate and parts of Foster, Glocester, Johnston, and Cranston. The Scituate Reservoir is operated by Providence Water Supply Board. The original treatment plant was state-of-the-art at the time of its construction. The plant was considered to be among the most technologically advanced of its day, and for many years the filtration system was the only plant of its type in New England. As demand continued to grow, the treatment plant underwent major expansions and renovations in the 1940s and again in the 60s. Today, the plant has a maximum treatment capacity of of water per day and still remains the largest treatment facility in New England. Politics Scituate is the most Republican town in Rhode Island.

The population was 41,186 at the 2010 census, making it the sixth largest city in the state. Being Rhode Island‚Äôs northernmost city, Woonsocket lies directly south of the Massachusetts state line and constitutes part of both the Providence metropolitan area and the larger Greater Boston Combined Statistical Area. The city is the corporate headquarters of CVS Health, a pharmacy services provider. It is home to Landmark Medical Center, the Museum of Work and Culture, and the American-French Genealogical Society. History Before the arrival of European settlers in northern Rhode Island during the 17th century, today's Woonsocket region was inhabited by three Native American tribes: the Nipmuc (Cowesett), Wampanoag, and Narragansett. In 1661, the English theologian Roger Williams purchased the area from the \\"Coweset and Nipmucks\\", and in a letter referred to modern day Woonsocket as Niswosakit.Walter Nebiker, The History of North Smithfield (New England History Press: Somersworth, NH: 1976), 12‚Äì13. Other possible derivations of the name include several Nipmuc geographic names from nearby Massachusetts. These include Woonksechocksett, from Worcester County meaning \\"fox country\\", and Wannashowatuckqut, also from Worcester County, meaning \\"at the fork of the river\\". Another theory proposes that the city was named after Woonsocket Hill in neighboring North Smithfield.\\"Historic and Architectural Resources of North Smithfield, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report,\\" North Smithfield - Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage ..., pg. 63, http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/survey_pdfs/north_smithfield.pdf Woonsocket Falls Village was founded in the 1820s. Its fortunes expanded as the Industrial Revolution developed in nearby Pawtucket. With the Blackstone River providing ample water power, the region became a prime location for textile mills. In 1831 Edward Harris built his first textile mill in Woonsocket. The town of Woonsocket was not established until 1867, when three villages in the town of Cumberland, namely Woonsocket Falls, Social and Jenckesville, officially became the town of Woonsocket. In 1871, three additional industrial villages from Smithfield‚Äì Hamlet, Bernon, and Globe, were added to the town, establishing its present boundaries. Woonsocket was incorporated as city in 1888. The growth of industries and associated jobs attracted numerous immigrants, predominantly Qu√©becois and French-Canadians from other provinces. When the Soci√©t√© Saint-Jean-Baptiste d'Holyoke organized a national cultural and benefit society in 1899, the Union Saint-Jean-Baptiste d‚ÄôAm√©rique, Woonsocket, with its proximity to several industrial areas having large French-Canadian populations, was chosen for the organization's headquarters. By 1913, a survey by the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers found the city had to have the 6th-largest population of French or French-Canadian foreign nationals in the country. In the decades that followed this population grew, and by time the local textile industry shuttered during the Great Depression, ethnic French Canadians comprised 75 percent of the population. French-language newspapers were published; radio programs, movies, and most public conversations were conducted in French.Pierre Anctil, \\"Franco-American in New England\\" in Dean R. Louder and Eric Waddell, ed., and Franklin Philip, tran. French America: Mobility, Identity and Minority Experience Across the Continent (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1993), p. 40 As recently as 1980, 70% of Woonsocket's population was of French-Canadian descent. The New England French their ancestors had once spoken has gradually declined and vanished from use in the public dialogue.Anctil, \\"Franco-Americans in New England\\", p. 41 Throughout the 20th century the city's fortunes ebbed and flowed with national trends. During the Great Depression the textile economy of Woonsocket came to an effective standstill; however, it was revived during World War II. The city became a major center of fabric manufacturing for the war effort, including production of military uniforms. In the postwar years, the Woonsocket economy diversified as manufacturing declined, and other commercial sectors, such as retail, technology and financial services took hold. In n the early 1980s Woonsocket was struggling with high unemployment rates. Beginning in 1979, Woonsocket sponsored Autumnfest, an annual cultural festival that takes place on Columbus Day weekend, at World War II Veteran's Memorial State Park. It has become one of the city's most popular events, attracting thousands of attendees.

While the village of Hope Valley is located in Hopkinton, its zip code, 02832, extends into the neighboring town of Richmond. The central portion of the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 as the Hope Valley Historic District. The historic district includes 134 contributing buildings and three other contributing structures. History The earliest European-American settlement of the village site was by Hezekiah Carpenter, who arrived in 1770 and dammed the Wood River and built several small water-powered mills. His settlement was called Carpenter's Mills. Around 1818 a tannery was built at the site. The textile industry arrived in 1824, when Gardner Nichols and Russell Thayer bought the existing mills and began to operate them for carding of wool; fulling, coloring and finishing of cloth; and manufacture of textile machinery.Hopkinton Preliminary Report, Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission, October 1976 The formerly separate village of Locustville, which grew up along Brushy Brook, is now part of Hope Valley. A dam and mill were built at the site of Locustville in 1820. In the late 19th century the Locustville mill property was taken over by the Nichols and Langworthy Company, which had operated the Hope Valley mills since 1835. There are conflicting versions of the origin of the village's name. The word \\"Hope\\" is the Rhode Island motto and used in various place names in Rhode Island. The phrase is used on the Rhode Island State Seal with an anchor because Roger Williams was inspired by the Biblical passage \\"hope is the anchor of the soul\\" in Hebrews, Verse 6:19.Howard M.

In May 1669, the General Assembly of Rhode Island organized King's County into the town of Westerly, and the town of Westerly organized itself into four separate areas: Westerly, Charlestown, Richmond, and Hopkinton. On April 19, 1873, there was a bridge washout in the village of Richmond Switch, which today is known as Wood River Junction. A passenger train approached, unaware of the bridge washout, and ran off the tracks and into the water. Eleven people died; others were swept down stream and were unaccounted for.

Its population was 5,237 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Abbeville County. Settled by French Huguenot settlers, it was named, along with the county, for the French town of the same name. History Abbeville was established by French Huguenots in 1764, at a site named by John de la Howe. It was incorporated in 1840. Famed states' rights advocate and Vice President John C. Calhoun first practiced law in Abbeville, and he was born on a farm on the outskirts in what is now Mt. Carmel. Abbeville and the American Civil War The rock at Secession Hill Historic Burt-Stark House Abbeville has the unique distinction of being both the birthplace and the deathbed of the Confederacy. On November 22, 1860, a meeting was held at Abbeville, at a site since dubbed \\"Secession Hill\\", to launch South Carolina's secession from the Union; one month later, the state of South Carolina became the first state to secede. At the end of the Civil War, with the Confederacy in shambles, Confederate President Jefferson Davis fled Richmond, Virginia, and headed south, stopping for a night in Abbeville at the home of his friend Armistead Burt. It was on May 2, 1865, in the front parlor of what is now known as the Burt-Stark Mansion that Jefferson Davis officially acknowledged the dissolution of the Confederate government, in the last official cabinet meeting. 2003 right-of-way standoff On December 8, 2003, in a 14-hour standoff that stemmed from a land-survey dispute, two Abbeville lawmen were killed by West Abbeville resident Steven Bixby. This siege has been compared by both sympathizers of the Bixbys and law enforcement agents to the events of Waco and Ruby Ridge. In February 2007, Steven Bixby was convicted on 17 counts including the two murders, as well as lesser charges of kidnapping and conspiracy. He was given two death sentences for the murders plus 125 years in prison on the other charges.

Gypsy consists of pound or sponge cake, boiled custard, sherry, whipping cream, and almonds. Variations of recipe substituting bourbon for sherry exist. It resembles English trifle and has been referred to as \\"tipsy pudding\\" and southern tiramisu. It is usually cooked for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas in many \\"old Abbeville\\" families. The dish is not known to exist outside of Abbeville other than in families who moved from Abbeville elsewhere. It is usually served in a special stemmed, medium-sized, decorative crystal compote. The origins of Gypsy go back to late 19th century. There is a mention of Gispy cake in 1831 edition William Kitchiner's The Cook's Oracle, which may have been a prototype for the Abbeville Gypsy. A local legend tells a story of an unknown woman serving Gypsy to Confederate President Jefferson Davis at the end of the Civil War in 1865. Theresa C. Brown included a recipe for Gipsy cake in the Creams chapter of her Modern Domestic Cookery (1871).

The early settlement was known as Pinder Town and later as Guntersville or Gunter's Crossroad, after the large number of North Carolinian settlers named Gunter. These men helped make up Company I of the 20th SC Infantry, which was part of Kershaw's Brigade during the Civil War. The town is situated on what was once farm land belonging to Elridge Gunter. He donated this property to benefit the schools of Wagener and the First Baptist Church. The Southern Railroad The little town grew when the Southern Railroad ran a line through to Batesburg. Nearly all of the towns that sprang up along the railroad wanted to use the last name of George Wagener, who was a strong supporter of the railroad and the owner of a wholesale house in Charleston. It was through the influence of J. A. Gunter, a prosperous local farmer, that the town received the honor of using this distinguished name. In the 1920s and 1930s, asparagus was grown here and exported across America. During the same period, cotton became a successful product and huge bales lined the streets awaiting departure via train. The children of Wagener frolicked among the hay bales during their games of hide-n-seek. A central town park is located where the railroad beds were. Education Wagener has a public library, a branch of the ABBE Regional Library System.

It is one of the principal cities in the Greenville-Anderson--Mauldin Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 824,112 at the 2010 census. It is further included in the larger Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, South Carolina Combined Statistical Area, with a total population of 1,266,995, at the 2010 census. Anderson is just off Interstate 85 and is from Atlanta and from Charlotte. Anderson is the smallest of the three primary cities that makes up the Upstate region and is nicknamed \\"The Electric City\\" and \\"The Friendliest City in South Carolina\\". Anderson County was named an \\"All-America City\\" in 2000. Anderson is the home of Anderson University, a selective private comprehensive university of approximately 3,900 undergraduate and graduate students. History=Anderson Court House Downtown Anderson in 1876 Cherokee first settled the area of what is today the city of Anderson. During the American Revolution the Cherokee sided with the British. After the American Revolutionary War the Cherokee's land was acquired as war reparations and colonized. In 1791 the South Carolina legislature created the Washington District which comprised Greenville, Anderson, Oconee and Pickens counties. The Washington District was then divided into Greenville and Pendleton districts. Anderson, Pickens and Oconee comprised the newly created Pendleton district. Anderson was settled in 1826 and incorporated in 1828 as Anderson Court House separating from the Pendleton district. The name Anderson is in honor of Robert Anderson who fought in the American Revolutionary War and also explored the Anderson region in the mid-18th century. Anderson District (later Anderson County after 1867) was also established in 1826 out of the Pendleton district. In 1851 the Johnson Female Seminary was established in Anderson as the first college of the town and was named after William Bullein Johnson. One year later the seminary was renamed Johnson University. During the American Civil War Johnson University was closed and converted into a Confederate treasury. On May 1, 1865 Union forces invaded Anderson looking for the Confederate treasury. The treasury office of Anderson was ransacked by Union forces and the main building of Johnson University was used as a Union headquarters. A minor skirmish erupted at the Battle of Anderson leading to two Union casualties. After the war a Union garrison was stationed in Anderson. The Electric City Portman Shoals Power Plant around 1920.

Whitner in 1895 at a hydroelectric plant on the Rocky River giving the city the name \\"The Electric City.\\" Anderson also became the first city in the world to supply a cotton gin by electricity. In 1895 Anderson Court House was renamed to Anderson. In 1897 Whitner's plant was upgraded with a 10,000 volt generating station at Portman Shoals. Whitner's power plant at Portman Shoals became the first hydroelectric plant in the United States to generate high voltage without step-up transformers . The Portman Dam was swept away in 1901 forcing Anderson to be in darkness until it was rebuilt in 1902. Anderson College In 1911 Anderson College was established by the Anderson Chamber of Commerce. Anderson College was a successor to the Johnson Female Seminary and is affiliated with the South Carolina Baptist Convention in particular the First Baptist Church of Anderson.

The population was 4,134 at the 2010 census.  History  In 1845 a group was created to connect the Piedmont region of South Carolina by rail to the existing rail system which then ran from Columbia to Charleston. The expanded rail line ran through what was to become Belton, with a spur line which ran to the nearby town of Anderson. Because of the population explosion that occurred by the time the railroad had been completed in 1853, the state incorporated the town in 1855, with the boundaries being located within a half mile radius from the new railroad depot. The city was given the name of Belton after the first president of the Columbia and Greenville Railroad from Newberry, John Belton O'Neal. The city prospered not only due to the railroad junction, but also because of the area's cotton crop, which led to the establishment of cotton mills. A large contribution of money was donated to the railroad business in which Belton prospered the 1840s by a man named William Henry Blaauw. In 1908, a municipal water system was established. A reinforced concrete tower with a capacity was built. Known as the Belton Standpipe, the tower is still in use today. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 5, 1987. The standpipe is the inspiration for the yearly Belton Standpipe Festival, first held in 1987 as a fundraising event. In bygone years Belton was the cotton ginning center for South Carolina, with many cotton mills that were part of the heritage. Belton boasts an arts center that holds regular art exhibitions open to the public. The arts center adds much character and artistic vibrancy to the city, and is available for event rentals and hosting many city events. The old train depot has been completely refurbished and is currently used as a comfortable function venue. Part of the depot is a museum filled with old Belton history. Tennis is an integral part of Belton's culture. The South Carolina Palmetto championships are held in Belton each year, using local residential tennis courts as part of the competition.

The population was 89 at the 2010 census. Government As of 2010 the town was governed by a mayor and four council members. History Pelzer was founded in the 19th Century as a mill town around several mill sites (the Lower Mill and the Upper Mill) on the Saluda River developed by the Pelzer Manufacturing Company. The first (lower) mill was completed in 1882; two additional expansions were referred to as mills 2 and 3, with construction of the 4th mill (the upper mill) starting in 1896. Pelzer Manufacturing drew power from two dams built along the Saluda River, which generated power with the help of the first generators ever sold by General Electric. The factory was the first in the country to use incandescent lighting. The company and town were named for Francis J. Pelzer, who surveyed sites along the river and laid out the town and was along with William Lebby and Ellison A. Smyth one of the founders of Pelzer Manufacturing. The first president and treasurer of the company was Ellison Adger Smyth, who held the corporate titles for 43 years. When Smyth decided to build the fourth mill, he initially selected a site four miles downriver from the town along a shoal, necessitating construction of a new mill town. Eventually, however, Smyth decided to build a new mill at Pelzer and began construction at the Upper Mill site, with power generation coming from the downstream shoals and dam. This was the first instance of a mill in South Carolina not built immediately adjacent to its power generation facility; Smyth contracted General Electric to build the power lines between the new dam and the existing town, a first in the industry that many competitors argued was doomed to fail. Smyth allowed GE to use the new Upper Mill as a testing ground for new electric generators and motors, which initially cost Pelzer Manufacturing money and made the new mill a money loser for several years, though it did become profitable in time. All four mills were designed and built by the architecture firm Lockwood, Greene & Co. Pelzer Manufacturing was sold in 1923 and the mills changed hands several times. The final functional owner was Gerber Products Company, which bought the mills in 1986 and made Onesies and other childrenswear until 1990, when the company ceased operations at Pelzer and moved all clothing manufacturing overseas. The mill properties were bought by Greenlight Enterprises, which destroyed the upper mill in 2004; the lower mill burned in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, the Pelzer Heritage Commission bought both mill sites. In the mill town, the mill managers' homes were laid out along what was the town's main street (Lebby St.), which eventually became South Carolina Highway 8. When the town was initially incorporated, only the main street and adjacent properties were included, so that the management of the mill would retain control of the town; the milltown itself occupied substantially more area than the incorporated town. In 2015 area residents voted to incorporate substantial additional property into the town limits. The Pelzer Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Community of Pelzer Historical Society was founded in 2008.

It was later renamed after B. A. Denmark, a railroad official. In April 1893, Mamie Baxter, a fourteen-year-old girl in Denmark, alleged that an African American unknown to her had attempted to attack her. John Peterson, a suspect, appealed to South Carolina Governor Benjamin Tillman for protection, fearing he would be lynched if taken to Denmark, and saying he could prove his innocence. He was taken by the mob, put on \\"trial\\" and, after the mob found him guilty, was murdered by hanging. Shown Peterson before the crowd killed him, Baxter reportedly testified: > \\"I don't know him sir, that don't look like him at all. He is the same > color, that's all. He don't talk like the man; he is thinner in the face, he > was as dark as this man, but his eyes don't look like him.\\" Historic sites The American Telephone and Telegraph Company Building, Denmark High School, and the Voorhees College Historic District, part of the campus of the historically black college, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

According to the history of the Dog Wood, it first began in the year of 1985 and still goes on once a year. This usually happens in April on a sunny day. This festival benefits the community. Each year of the festival visitors region-wide come to Denmark, usually stopping by one of Denmark's retailers and restaurants before or after going to the festival. This has a good effect on the local economy. A restaurant like McDonald's usually has an average of 14 cars located on the property, but on a festival day, locals say that the car population gets boosted by more than half.

History In 1785 the district of Winton County was formed from a portion of the Orangeburg District in order to create another judicial circuit. It was given its current name in 1798 when the county and its seat were named for Revolutionary War leader John Barnwell (1748‚Äì1800), who headed a militia in South Carolina. Barnwell County originally stretched from the Savannah River on the west almost to the Atlantic Ocean. Built in 1832, the South Carolina Railroad connected Charleston to Hamburg, near Augusta, Georgia, upriver on the Savannah River. The designation of two stops on the railroad led to the development of the towns of Blackville and Williston in the mid-nineteenth century. Civil War Barnwell gave generously to the Confederate cause. Its most distinguished participant was Confederate General Johnson Hagood, who was later elected as governor of South Carolina, serving. When Union General Judson Kilpatrick was in Barnwell, as part of General Sherman's March to the Sea, his horses were stabled in the Episcopal Church of the Holy Apostles; the baptismal font in the church was used to water the horses.History of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Apostles, Barnwell, South Carolina from the church's website Registered historic sites The Banksia Hall, Bethlehem Baptist Church, Church of the Holy Apostles Rectory, Church of the Holy Apostles, Episcopal, and Old Presbyterian Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town is a primary city within the Hilton Head Island- Bluffton-Beaufort, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. Following the Tariff of 1842, Bluffton became a hotbed of separatist sentiment. In 1844 the Bluffton Movement, a protest against federal taxes, gave birth to the secession movement and led South Carolina to be the first state to leave the Union. In the antebellum period Bluffton became a popular location for wealthy merchants and plantation owners. During the Civil War two-thirds of the town was destroyed by fire during the Union's Bluffton Expedition on June 4, 1863.Jeff Fulgham, The Bluffton Expedition: The Burning of Bluffton, South Carolina, During the Civil War (Bluffton, S.C.: Jeff Fulgham, 2012), 155.  History = Colonial era (1670‚Äì1776)  During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the area comprising southern Beaufort County was known as Granville County of St. Luke's Parish. The Yamasee people were invited to settle in the area by Lord Cardoss, leader of the nearby Scottish settlement in Beaufort. The Yamasee established ten towns with over 1,200 inhabitants in the area. In 1715, the Yamasee War broke out, and after several years of fighting, the Yamasee migrated to Florida, opening the \\"Indian Lands\\" to European settlement. In 1718, the Lords Proprietors carved the area into several new baronies, including the Devil's Elbow Barony that contained the future town of Bluffton. The first titled owner of the land was the Barbadian planter Sir John Colleton. Following the departure of the Yamasee people, colonists began building plantations in the Bluffton area in 1728. The Colletons prospered by growing cotton, corn and indigo.Rose Hill Mansion rosehillmansion.com  American Revolution (1776‚Äì1785)  Before his death in 1776, Sir John Colleton (grandson of the original owner) developed plantations near Victoria Bluff - Foot Point areas and later disposed of much of his barony, much of it bought by the Rose and Kirk families. These plantations were destroyed by the British under General Pr√©vost in 1779. During the 18th century, much of the land south of the May River (now known as Palmetto Bluff) was covered with rice fields.Island Packet article islandpacket.com Rice became a lucrative crop and a part of lowcountry culture until the early 20th century when it was disrupted by a series of devastating storms.Island Packet article storm islandpacket.com  Antebellum era (1785‚Äì1861)  Church of the Cross This 350- to 400-year-old tree at Stock Farm in Bluffton is known as the \\"Secession Oak\\", the location where Robert Rhett called for the South to withdraw from the Union in 1844. The town of Bluffton was eventually built on two adjoining parcels in the Devil's Elbow Barony purchased by Benjamin Walls and James Kirk. The first homes were constructed during the early 1800s by area plantation owners seeking the high ground and cool river breezes as an escape from the unhealthy conditions present on Lowcountry rice and cotton plantations. Easy access by water provided more incentive for expansion, and the many tidal coves afforded excellent locations for residences. The community was originally known as \\"Kirk's Landing\\" or \\"Kirk's Bluff\\" as shown in Mill's Atlas of 1825. The first streets were formally laid out during the 1830s and the name of Bluffton decided upon in the early 1840s as a compromise between the Kirk and Pope families. The first South Carolina secession movement began under what is now known as the Secession Oak tree, led by R. Barnwell Rhett on July 31, 1844. In the 1850s a steamboat landing was built at the end of Calhoun Street, and Bluffton became the commercial center of southern Beaufort County as a stopover for travelers between Savannah and Beaufort. In 1852 the town was officially incorporated by an act of the South Carolina General Assembly and comprised approximately one square mile. The iconic Church of the Cross was designed by architect Edward Brickell White to seat up to 600 parishioners at a cost of $5,000, and construction began in 1854. On July 17, 1857, the first services were held at the Church of the Cross.Historic District Inventory townofbluffton.sc.gov  Civil War (1861‚Äì1865)  After a Union victory at the Battle of Port Royal on November 7, 1861, Confederate Brigadier-General Thomas F. Drayton directed the evacuation of rebel forces from Hilton Head Island to the Bluffton mainland. Occupying Port Royal Harbor, the Union's South Atlantic Blockading Squadron could then be monitored from rebel lookouts dispersed from Bluffton's substantial picket headquarters. Bluffton's location resulted in it being the only strategic position on the East Coast where the Confederates could gather direct intelligence on the Union squadron, which was conducting crucial blockade operations along the southern coastline. In late May 1863, Major- General David Hunter, Commander of the Department of the South, ordered the destruction of Bluffton by fire. The Union \\"Expedition against Bluffton\\" was carried out on June 4, 1863, destroying approximately two-thirds of the town's estimated 60 structures. Only the town's two churches and fifteen residences remained standing after the attack. Presently eight antebellum homes and two churches exist in Old Town, highlighting the town's now popular nationally registered historic district.

Rebuilding came slowly, as few local landowners could still afford the luxury of a summer home in Bluffton. The town did not experience a true rebuilding until the 1880s, when it emerged as a commercial center for Beaufort County.  Contemporary era (1945‚Äìpresent)  Palmetto Bluff at Montage Resort in Bluffton Bluffton remained a commercial center until Coastal Highway (US 17) and the bridge at Port Wentworth over the Savannah River were completed, making riverboat trade and travel less attractive. The Great Depression, beginning shortly thereafter, brought the closure of the town's prosperity and commercial importance. The popularity of Bluffton as a vacation spot remained even after its loss of commercial stature. The development of Hilton Head Island, nearby Sun City, and related development in the 1990s caused a resurgence of commercial activity in the town. In 1996 Bluffton was designated a National Historic District with 46 contributing buildings and two contributing sites. In 1998 the Heyward House opened to the public by the Bluffton Historical Preservation Society. In 1999 the Heyward House was part of the Save America's Treasures program. The Heyward House became the town's welcome center in 2000, and the Old Town Bluffton historic district was established through zoning regulations and architectural standards. In 2005, Bluffton was recognized as a Preserve America Community, a federal program that encourages community efforts to preserve the nation's cultural and historical assets. Altamaha Town, Bluffton Historic District, Church of the Cross, and Rose Hill Plantation House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Geography  Bluffton was once mostly wetlands, many of which were drained possibly during the antebellum era. Agriculture and pine timber harvesting contributed to the landscape still present today.

It is perhaps best known for its U.S. Marine Corps training facility Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, where about 16,000 Marines pass through boot camp every year. History Parris Island was first colonized by Europeans in 1562, when members of a French expedition led by Jean Ribaut temporarily settled on the island. This was the first semi- permanent European settlement in what are now considered the United States. Four years later, a town named Santa Elena was founded here by Spanish Conquistador Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s. It was the capital of La Florida from 1566 to 1587, during which time Spanish explorers sailed from Santa Elena to explore the Tennessee Valley and Chesapeake Bay. An expedition also traveled overland into the interior to western North Carolina and points west. After coming under English control, the island was granted to Robert Daniell in 1706 and became known as Port Royal Island. It later came into the hands of Colonel Alexander Parris, sometimes spelled \\"Paris\\", Public Treasurer of South Carolina. After his death in 1736, it gradually became known as Parris Island (and the name Port Royal Island was applied to a different one to the north). In the early years of the Marine Corps presence it was referred to as Paris Island. Parris Island was captured by the Union Army in 1861 during the American Civil War. It became a coaling station during the war. After the war, through the efforts of African-American Congressman Robert Smalls, it continued as a coaling station for the United States Navy and became known as the Port Royal Naval Station. The island was purchased outright in 1883. In the early 1890s, a dry dock was constructed at the naval station. The dry dock was completed in 1895. In 1915, Parris Island became the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, which it has remained ever since. The Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site and Parris Island Drydock and Commanding Generals House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Parris Island is located at (32.328944, -80.694619). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of , of which of it is land and of it (37.96%) is water. The land was previously owned by Zachariah McGill, a wealthy South Carolinian landowner of mixed White/Indian ancestry through the early-to-mid-19th century. Many questions and an unresolved legal battle still linger regarding the sale of Parris Island to the U.S. military in 1883 under questionable circumstances. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 4,841 people, 318 households, and 297 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 398.0 people per square mile (153.7/km2).

Largely because of annexation of surrounding areas (including Parris Island), the population of Port Royal rose from 3,950 in 2000 to 10,678 in 2010, a 170% increase. As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, Port Royal is included within the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. Port Royal is home to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and Naval Hospital Beaufort. History Port Royal takes its name from the adjacent Port Royal Sound, which was explored and named by Frenchman Jean Ribault in 1562. Ribault founded the short-lived settlement of Charlesfort on Parris Island. The area later became the site of a Spanish and still later Scottish colony during the 17th century. Port Royal was the site of the Naval Battle of Port Royal during the Civil War. Later during the war, it was the one of the sites of the Port Royal Experiment, which included most of the Sea Islands in Union hands. In 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation was first read at Christmas under the Proclamation tree in Port Royal. Due to the benefits of a large and sheltered natural harbor, Port Royal was able to develop port facilities to support the growing phosphate mining activities after the Civil War. The Port Royal Railroad was completed from Port Royal to a junction with the main Charleston and Savannah Railway in Yemassee, thus establishing a land route for trade and commerce. Port Royal was the southeastern terminus of the Charleston and Western Carolina Railway, the railroad last had passenger trains to Port Royal in the mid-1950s. Development of a community around the previously isolated port site at the end of the Beaufort River and Battery Creek led to the platting of streets and town lots by development interests. A land rush ensued, and Port Royal was officially incorporated in 1874, 300 years after initial settlement efforts. The Sea Islands Hurricane of 1893 destroyed much of the phosphate industry and stunted development, but the port continued to operate throughout the 20th century. The opening of Parris Island as a Marine Corps recruiting station brought some vitality back to the community, though rapid residential growth did not occur until the later decades of the 20th century. The port's vitality however began to decline as the State of South Carolina began to focus on dredging Charleston's harbor and expanding port facilities further up the coast. In an effort to save costs, the State Ports Authority closed the port facility in Port Royal in 2004. Efforts to redevelop have been ongoing but been hampered by the Great Recession. The Camp Saxton Site, Fort Frederick Heritage Preserve, Hasell Point Site, Little Barnwell Island, F.W. Scheper Store, and Union Church of Port Royal are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Neighborhoods Sands Beach boardwalk The Old Village is the historic center of Port Royal. Streets running north‚Äìsouth are named after the capitals of nations whose immigrants have settled in the Port Royal area (Paris, London, Madrid, and Edinburgh). Paris Avenue is the primary commercial street in the Old Village. Immediately north of the Old Village is a low-density residential area known as Mossy Creek, which crosses over into incorporated areas of the city of Beaufort to the north. A large portion of Port Royal's population lives in the Preserve at Port Royal Apartments, in between the Old Village and Mossy Creek. Historically, Port Royal's municipal boundaries were defined by Beaufort to the north, the Beaufort River to the east, Parris Island to the south, and Battery Creek to the west. Since the start of the 21st century however, Port Royal began to aggressively annex lands west and south of its core area, prompting controversy. Port Royal annexed Parris Island Marine Corps Base on October 11, 2000, effectively doubling the municipal population overnight due to on-base housing. Port Royal also annexed properties in the Shell Point and Burton areas of Beaufort County. Challenges were filed, and the 2000 annexation of undeveloped Rose Island was to be heard by the South Carolina Supreme Court in 2005. Town representatives said the city annexed Rose Island because it was within the \\"line of sight\\" of the Doggett Tract, a group of islands off Shell Point already under the town's jurisdiction.Geoff ZIEZULEWICZ, \\"Judge to hear Port Royal annexation suit\\", Beaufort Gazette, reprinted in Island Packet, 1 June 2005 In 2006, Port Royal annexed two tracts of land south of the Broad River based on the so-called line-of-sight rule. Culture=In film The hurricane scene from the 1994 film Forrest Gump was filmed in the town's dock area. Community events Paris Avenue (the main street of the Old Village) periodically hosts Street Music events throughout the year. Port Royal also hosts an annual soft shell crab festival in late April and a community oyster roast in late October. Beaufort Charities hosts its annual Oyster Roast in Live Oaks Park in March.

The most common types of power tools use electric motors. Internal combustion engines and compressed air are also commonly used. Other power sources include steam engines, direct burning of fuels and propellants, such as in powder-actuated tools, or even natural power sources such as wind or moving water. Tools directly driven by animal power are not generally considered power tools. Power tools are used in industry, in construction, in the garden, for housework tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and around the house for purposes of driving (fasteners), drilling, cutting, shaping, sanding, grinding, routing, polishing, painting, heating and more. Power tools are classified as either stationary or portable, where portable means hand-held. Portable power tools have obvious advantages in mobility. Stationary power tools, however, often have advantages in speed and precision. A typical table saw, for instance, not only cuts faster than a regular hand saw, but the cuts are smoother, straighter, and more square than what is normally achievable with a hand-held power saw. Some stationary power tools can produce objects that cannot be made in any other way. Lathes, for example, produce truly round objects. Stationary power tools for metalworking are usually called machine tools. The term machine tool is not usually applied to stationary power tools for woodworking, although such usage is occasionally heard, and in some cases, such as drill presses and bench grinders, exactly the same tool is used for both woodworking and metalworking. History Early industrial revolution-era factories had batteries of power tools driven by belts from overhead shafts. The prime power source was a water wheel or (later) a steam engine. The introduction of the electric motor (and electric distribution networks) in the 1880s made possible the self-powered stationary and portable tools we know today. The global market for power tools is $33 billion (in 2016) and estimated to reach $46 billion in 2025. Energy sources Currently, an electric motor is the most popular choice to power stationary tools, though in the past they were powered by windmills, water wheels, and steam. Some museums and hobbyists still maintain and operate stationary tools powered by these older power sources. Portable electric tools may be either corded or battery- powered. Compressed air is the customary power source for nailers and paint sprayers. A few tools (called powder-actuated tools) are powered by explosive cartridges. Tools that run on gasoline or gasoline-oil mixes are made for outdoor use; typical examples include most chainsaws and string trimmers. Other tools like blowtorches will burn their fuel externally to generate heat. Compressed air is universally used where there is a possibility of fuel or vapor ignition - such as automotive workshops. Professional level electric tools differ from DIY or 'consumer' tools by being double insulated and not earthed - in fact, they must not be earthed for safety reasons. Safety While hand-held power tools are extremely helpful, they also produce large amounts of noise and vibrations.NIOSH Power tools database Using power tools without hearing protection over a long period of time can put a person at risk for hearing loss. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that a person should not be exposed to noise at or above 85 dB, for the sake of hearing loss prevention. Most power tools, including drills, circular saws, belt sanders, and chainsaws, operate at sound levels above the 85 dB limit, some even reaching over 100 dB. NIOSH strongly recommends wearing hearing protection while using these kinds of power tools. Prior to the 1930s, power tools were often housed in cast metal housings. The cast metal housings were heavy, contributing to repetitive use injuries, as well as conductive - often shocking the user. As Henry Ford adapted to the manufacturing needs of World War II, he requested that A. H. Peterson, a tool manufacturer, create a lighter electric drill that was more portable for his assembly line workers. At this point, the Hole-Shooter, a drill that weighed 5 lbs. was created by A. H. Peterson. The Peterson Company eventually went bankrupt after a devastating fire and recession, but the company was auctioned off to A. F. Siebert,History of Peterson and Milwaukee Companies a former partner in the Peterson Company, in 1924 and became the Milwaukee Electric Tool Company. In the early 1930s, companies started to experiment with housings of thermoset polymer plastics. In 1956, under the influence of Hans Erich Slany, Robert Bosch GmbH was one of the first companies to introduce a power tool housing made of glass filled nylon.

During the Civil War, the H.L. Hunley departed from Breach Inlet, between Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island. In the late nineteenth century, local residents began using the island as a vacation spot. At that time it was only accessible by ferry. It was bought by J.S. Lawrence in 1899, who gave the island its current name; before then it was known as \\"Hunting Island\\" or \\"Long Island\\". A 50-room hotel was built in 1906. In 1912, James Sottile had a beach pavilion and an amusement park built, and a trolley line was constructed from Mount Pleasant on the mainland to Isle of Palms via Sullivan's Island. In 1929, Grace Memorial Bridge was built between Charleston and Mount Pleasant to allow automobile traffic to reach the island. Large-scale residential development began when J.C. Long bought up most of the island and built low-cost housing for World War II veterans. In 1975, the Sea Pines Company (of Hilton Head Island fame) established the development now known as the Wild Dunes Beach and Racquet Club. E. Lee Spence, a pioneer underwater archaeologist and prolific author of books and articles about shipwrecks and sunken treasure, discovered, with the help of Isle of Palms residents Wally Shaffer and George Campsen, many shipwrecks along the shores of the Isle of Palms in the 1960s. Their discoveries included the Civil War blockade runners Rattlesnake, Stonewall Jackson, Mary Bowers, Constance, Norseman and the Georgiana. The iron-hulled steamer Georgiana, which was sunk on her maiden voyage, was described in contemporary documents as pierced for 14 guns and more powerful than the famous Confederate cruiser Alabama. These historic discoveries resulted in the passage of South Carolina's Underwater Antiquities Act allowing the archaeological salvage of shipwrecks. During Hurricane Hugo, which struck September 21, 1989, much of the island was flooded by the storm surge. The northeastern end of the Isle of Palms, which is home to the private community of Wild Dunes, endured a severe erosion crisis as a shoal attached to that section of the island and caused sand to be washed away from around the foundation of a large condominium. The city undertook a controversial beach restoration project in the spring and summer of 2008 which replenished the beach with dredged sand and saved the threatened structures. In February 2019, it was reported that the city's police force was undergoing a crisis following several resignations.

Located southwest of Charleston in Charleston County, South Carolina, it is primarily a private beach and golf resort. It is home to the Kiawah Island Golf Resort, with spacious villas, beaches, large and acclaimed golf courses, and other attractions. As of the 2010 census, Kiawah Island's population was 1,626, up from 1,163 at the 2000 census. The island is part of the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville metropolitan area. Alternative spellings and variants of the name itself include \\"Kiawa\\", \\"Kittiwar\\" (in DuBose Heyward's novel Porgy), and \\"Kittiwah\\" (in George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess). The proper pronunciation is sometimes considered difficult: the following reference provides an example pronunciation of Kiawah Island.https://www.howtopronounce.com/kiawah-island History The Bass Pond Site and Arnoldus Vander Horst House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Kiawah was named for the Kiawah Indians who were led by their head chieftain or cassique. In the year 1670, the cassique of the Kiawah led English colonists to settle at Charlestowne Landing. In 1699, former pirate Captain George Raynor gained possession of Kiawah Island. On November 1, 1701, Captain Raynor sold half of the island to Captain William Davis, and left the other half in his will for his granddaughter. The half left to his will was passed through family members until John Stanyarne acquired the property. Stanyarne then purchased the remaining half of the island from the family of Captain Davis. The island was primarily used for cattle farming prior to the Civil War. Stanyarne built an estate that was valued highly, falling into a category of value that only 19% of the properties of South Carolina qualified for. In his will he left the southwestern portion of the island to his granddaughter Mary Gibbs, and the northeastern portion to his granddaughter Elizabeth Vanderhorst. Both portions were to be passed down until the third generation, when they would become considered fee simple ownerships. Gibbs died at a young age, and it is assumed that her father, Robert Gibbs, maintained her portion of the island. During the Revolutionary War the island has very few records of events, other than its use as a safe recovery space for American soldiers and their families. The Vanderhorst property was burned down during the time of the Revolutionary War, but was rebuilt shortly after, and finished in the beginning of the 19th century. The Vanderhorst family infrequently inhabited the island, and often stayed in their homes elsewhere along the Carolina coast. The Vanderhorst family still only claimed ownership of half of the island, with the other half being passed through the wills of the Gibbs family. A portion of the island controlled by the Gibbs family was sold to William Seabrook, and the other portion to Isaac Wilson. The island during this time only remained inhabited by slaves and the properties built by the families. The Civil War impacted Kiawah Island as it did the entire South. There were not damages recorded. The Vanderhorst family was not presently residing there, but they did check the state of the property in the earlier years of the war. There are not records of what occurred on Kiawah during the war in terms of battles, but it was sieged by the North with Charleston and taken over by Northern troops. They remained stationed there as a precautionary measure. The properties seemed to have obtained damage, but it is unclear how or how extensive. The Vanderhorst family did not have many records from this time period. It seems that at the end of the war they were in financial trouble, and were unsure about how to maintain ownership of Kiawah. They were able to keep their portion of the island, while the other two portions changed ownership. The Vanderhorsts hired freed slaves for labor, and were able to produce cotton on the island. By 1870, Arnoldus Vanderhorst, the present caretaker and owner of the Vanderhorst portion of Kiawah, recorded that the island was restored and there was agricultural growth. Development Long held by the Vanderhorst family, Kiawah Island was purchased by C.C. Royal in 1950 for logging and timber; he went on to develop the first summer home neighborhood in 1954 along the beach and named the street Eugenia, after his wife. In 1974 Royal's heirs sold the island to Kuwait Investment Corporation; soon after, a thorough environmental survey was conducted, and a master plan for Kiawah's development was produced with help from the Sea Pines Company. Two years later, in 1976, real estate sales commenced and the Cougar Point (formerly Marsh Point) golf course was opened. The 1980s saw the opening of two of the seven golf courses associated with Kiawah-Turtle Point in 1981 and Osprey Point in 1988. lattet year also saw all resort assets and amenities, along with Kiawah's undeveloped lands, purchased by the development group Kiawah Resort Associates (KRA), owned by Charles P. Darby III and Patrick W. McKinney, et al. The Town of Kiawah was also established in the same year. Following the impact of Hurricane Hugo in 1989, KRA sold resort assets to Landmark Land Co., which then sold the assets to William H. Goodwin in 1993. The 1990s saw the establishment of the Kiawah Island Club in 1993 and the addition of three more courses: the Ocean Course in 1991, the River Course in 1995, and Oak Point in 1997. The last of Kiawah's associated golf courses, Cassique, was opened in 2000. Freshfields Village, a town-center-type mix of shopping, dining, and services saw ground broken in 2004. That same year, The Sanctuary hotel opened on the island. In 2013, Darby and associates sold Kiawah Partners to the South Street Partners for an estimated $350 million. This transaction included Kiawah Island Club, Kiawah Island Real Estate, Freshfields Village, Kiawah Island Utility, and other domestic and international holdings.

The population was 499 at the 2010 census. It is situated on the Atlantic coast, on land surrounded by Francis Marion National Forest, and has traditionally derived its livelihood from the Atlantic Ocean and coastal marshes by fishing, shrimping and oystering. McClellanville is part of the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville metropolitan area and the Charleston-North Charleston Urbanized Area. History McClellanville village began in the late 1860s when local plantation owners A.J. McClellan and R.T. Morrison sold lots in the vicinity of Jeremy Creek to planters of the Santee Delta, who sought relief from summer fevers. The first store opened soon after the Civil War, and the village became the social and economic center for a wide area that produced timber, rice, cotton, naval stores, and seafoods. Incorporated in 1926, McClellanville became, and remains, best known for its shrimping fleet and seafood industries. In 1989 the town was devastated by the full brunt of Hurricane Hugo which destroyed homes, downed century-old oaks, deposited shrimp boats in front yards, and otherwise altered much of the picturesque character of this historic fishing village. The stronger north side of the eyewall passed directly over the village while a Category 4 hurricane. Residents taking refuge in the local high school, a designated storm shelter, were surprised by a storm surge which threatened to drown the refugees. Helping one another in complete darkness, they managed to crawl into a space above the false ceilings of the building and none were lost.

It is the fourth largest municipality and largest town in South Carolina, and for several years was one of the state's fastest-growing areas, doubling in population between 1990 and 2000. The population was 67,843 at the 2010 census. The estimated population in 2019 was 91,684. At the foot of the Arthur Ravenel Bridge is Patriots Point, a naval and maritime museum, home to the World War II aircraft carrier , which is now a museum ship. The Ravenel Bridge, an eight-lane highway that was completed in 2005, spans the Cooper River and links Mount Pleasant with the city of Charleston. Kevin Vincent is a notable History The site of Mount Pleasant was originally occupied by the Sewee people, an Algonquian language-speaking tribe. The first white settlers arrived from England on July 6, 1680, under the leadership of Captain Florentia O'Sullivan. Captain O'Sullivan had been granted , which included not only the island that bears his name, but also the land that was to become Mount Pleasant. On the earliest map of the time this area was called \\"North Point\\". In 1696, 51 new settlers arrived. Each family was allotted several hundred acres in the area that became known as Christ Church parish. In 1706 the Province of Carolina withstood several attacks by the Spanish and the French from their settlements to the south and were victorious in defeating French invaders in an area known as \\"Abcaw\\". The area of \\"Abcaw\\" was Hobcaw Plantation, located between Shem Creek and the Wando River. Later, it was also known as Shipyard Plantation. Its deep water and abundance of good timber made it ideal for the development of a prosperous shipbuilding enterprise. Lands adjacent to Hobcaw Point were owned at different times by several different families, many of which maintained ferries which served Mount Pleasant. By 1721, 107 families were living in Christ Church parish, including 400 whites and 637 slaves. As the area was developed for plantations, enslaved Africans and African Americans made up the chief labor force of the slave society. They and the following freedmen comprised a majority of the population through the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1754, Charles Pinckney acquired a 715-acre plantation, cultivating the commodity crops of rice and indigo. It became known as Snee Farm near here. His son Charles retained the plantation until 1817. It was operated as a plantation through the 19th century. On September 24, 1860, a public meeting was held in Mount Pleasant; it resulted in the first secession resolution passed in the state. The secession convention met in Charleston on December 20, 1860. With the advent of the Civil War, Battery Guerry and an adjacent floating battery between Mount Pleasant and Sullivan's Island were instrumental in defense of the city. They were also bases for attacks on Fort Sumter. The city was defended by a line of fortifications from Elliot's Creek at Boone Hall to Copahee Sound. Mount Pleasant was the secret training ground for the nine-man crew of the Confederate submarine , H.L. Hunley. This small vessel was launched from Breach Inlet in 1864 to attack and sink the . View from the old Pitt Street Bridge in Old Village The original plank-and-barrel footbridge, later known as the Pitt Street Bridge at the foot of the Old Village area in Mount Pleasant, was used by the crew of the H.L. Hunley to cross to Breach Inlet to test the submarine. In 1899 the original wooden plank bridge was replaced by a trolley bridge. A generation later, in 1929 a steel drawbridge was built for vehicle access between Sullivan's Island and Mount Pleasant. The Pitt Street bridge was dismantled in 1945, but the remains can still be seen in the Intracoastal Waterway. The area has been maintained since then as the Pickett Bridge Recreation Area. It was named for Charleston doctor Otis Pickett. The \\"Old Village\\" is Mount Pleasant's oldest neighborhood; the oldest home, 111 Hibben Street (the Hibben House) was constructed in 1755 by Jacob Motte, a descendant of French Huguenots who had immigrated to South Carolina. In the early 21st century, the Old Village is centered on the Pitt Street Shops at the northwestern end of the street. Among them is the Pitt Street Pharmacy, which was featured on the Food Network. It has operated at this location for more than 60 years. As a result of emancipation after the Civil War, the numerous slaves were freed. Continuing their numerical dominance of the population, in 1875 African Americans made up 73% of the population in Charleston County.Melinda Meeks Hennessy, \\"Racial Violence During Reconstruction: The 1876 Riots in Charleston and Cainhoy\\", South Carolina Historical Magazine, Vol. 86, No. 2, (April 1985), 104-106 Some of the freedmen developed Scanlonville, one of the first African-American communities to be formed after the Civil War in the Charleston area. It continues today as a neighborhood within Mount Pleasant. Robert Scanlon, a freedman carpenter, purchased the property known as Remley's Plantation, bordering Charleston harbor along the Wando River in Mount Pleasant. Scanlon was the president and founder of the Charleston Land Company, formed by 100 poor local freedmen who pooled their resources and paid $10 per share, in order to purchase large tracts of land in the area. The Charleston Land Company divided this tract into smaller lots so that freedmen could have their own land. Remley's Plantation was divided into farm lots and city lots (which were smaller) to form the community of Scanlonville. The Charleston Land Company and Scanlonville are one of four known cooperative real estate development ventures among African-American freedmen after the Civil War. Fishing boats on Shem Creek West of Scanlonville is Riverside, during the Jim Crow years of the 20th century known as the largest and oldest of five \\"black beaches\\" in Charleston County. It was established when public facilities were segregated under state law. Riverside officially opened in 1930 and featured a dance pavilion, athletics field, bathhouse, playground, and a boardwalk along the Wando River. Riverside Pavilion was the only venue where black city residents could see musical legends such as Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, B.B. King, and Ivory Joe Hunter. Music performances at the Pavilion spawned juke joints, or night clubs, in Scanlonville and eventually a hotel called White's Paradise. James Brown was known to have frequented this hotel. Exploring the marshes After the original park owner died in 1975, operations of the Riverside property were taken over by Charleston County. It eventually sold the property to a real estate company, which developed this area as a private gated community. Public access to the waterfront ended. On September 21, 1989, Mount Pleasant was hit by Hurricane Hugo, a Category Four hurricane. While the town was spared from the worst of the storm (Category 4 conditions were suffered by areas further north of the city), the town and its neighboring barrier islands were still hard-hit. Children who lived through the storm were featured in an early episode of Nickelodeon's Nick News, along with children from Hurricane Andrew. Development continued. A year after the storm, more people moved to the area, and the town had its largest growth spurt. It increased from a population of roughly 23,000 in 1990 to one of roughly 47,000 in 2000. Mount Pleasant is separated from Charleston by the Cooper River. For many years, the town was populated largely on a seasonal basis by Charleston residents wealthy enough to afford summer homes across the river from the Charleston peninsula. The population of Mount Pleasant was centered in \\"Old Village\\". The county seat for Berkeley County was located in Mount Pleasant from 1882 until 1895, when it was moved to Moncks Corner. Shem Creek In 1928, a bridge from the Charleston Peninsula to Mount Pleasant was built. Spanning Town Creek and the Cooper River, and crossing the uninhabited Drum Island, the two-lane Grace Memorial Bridge was opened as a toll bridge. A second and larger bridge, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge, opened in 1966. On July 16, 2005, the eight-lane Arthur Ravenel Bridge opened for automotive traffic, replacing the two aging bridges. It is one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. A week before the new bridge officially opened, pedestrians were allowed to cross the bridge, and commemorative coins were distributed. Also, a fireworks display was a part of the ceremonies leading up to the opening of the bridge. Several cars from the same time period as the Grace Memorial Bridge, including several restored Model A Fords, made a final crossing of the old bridges. The remaining portions of the old bridges were demolished. Local residents watched as the bridges were demolished by explosives over several weeks, through the summer of 2006. In 2004, Mount Pleasant became one of the first municipalities in the United States to pass a \\"pay-before-you-pump\\" gas ordinance. It was intended to reduce stealing of gas that had accompanied rising prices.

The city of Charleston is to the northeast. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Seabrook Island has a total area of , of which is land and , or 14.74%, is water. History In 1666, British subject Lt. Col. Robert Sanford arrived on Seabrook as an explorer in royal service to King Charles II. By 1684, the local Stono Indians were persuaded to cede their lands to the proprietary government, which in turn sold the property to English settlers. During the American Revolutionary years, the island was used as a staging area for Hessian and British troops during the Siege of Charleston. In 1816, the island was sold to William Seabrook of nearby Edisto Island, hence the present name. Under Seabrook's ownership, the island was used for growing cotton. At the height of the Civil War, Seabrook sold the island to William Gregg, who rented the land to Charles Andell. After the turn of the century, the island was sold to sportsmen for hunting, fishing, and recreation. In 1939, the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina rented land on Seabrook to establish a summer camp for underprivileged children. In 1951, about of land were given to the church. In 1970, the diocese sold about to private developers who planned the private, residential community that Seabrook Island is today. Eighteen years later, the town of Seabrook was incorporated, and it celebrated a decade of private ownership and self-government in 1997. In 2005 Seabrook Island Club membership became a requirement for new purchasers of property on Seabrook. This requirement raised the economic growth and vitality of the Island, resulting in a strong financial positions for the Seabrook Island Club. In 2010 the Horizon Plan, a complete reconstruction of island amenities, was completed, providing property owners and guests with a new fitness/community center, racquet club, full- service clubhouse, beach club and renovated equestrian center, pools and golf practice facility. The switch to mandatory membership has been controversial with some owners contending that the requirement has depressed real estate sales and prices. Seabrook Island amenities include two championship golf courses, nationally recognized racquet club with 15 Har Tru tennis courts and two pickle ball courts, equestrian center offering trail and beach rides, ocean-front dining venues, swimming pools, fitness center and expansive banquet/private dining venues.

It is part of the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson Combined Statistical Area (CSA) which has a population of 1,478,648 according to 2018 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau. History Located near the northern border of the state, the present-day site of Blacksburg was first settled by a man named Stark. Mr. Stark, who had lived in Charleston, South Carolina prior to moving to the area, had gotten several people to come along with him on an agriculture venture, but this venture would fail. Those who stayed behind named the area \\"Stark's Folly\\". The railroad played a major role in the history of Blacksburg. In the late 19th century the Black family, headed by John G. Black, a Confederate veteran, was living in the area and persuaded the C.C. & C. Railroad Company to lay track through the town and build a depot. The town soon became known as \\"Black's Station\\" in honor of John G. Black and was incorporated as Black's Station town in 1876.Acts and Joint Resolutions of the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina Passed at the Regular Session of 1875-1876, Columbia, SC (page 133) The legal town was renamed \\"Blacksburg\\" in 1888. Major John F. Jones of Massachusetts came to live in Blacksburg when hired as superintendent of the C. C. & C. Railroad. He donated his own money to build a school, hotel (the Cherokee Inn), and several other buildings in Blacksburg. He lived in Blacksburg until 1922, when he was appointed the South Carolina Internal Revenue Collector by the President of the United States. In the 1890s large amounts of iron ore were found in the area, and many people hoping to make a fortune from mining it flocked to the town. Blacksburg became a boom town, and hotels and saloons were built for the new visitors. The town went by the name \\"Iron City\\" for a short time. Because of the \\"iron rush\\" the town became quite wealthy.

Gaffney is known as the \\"Peach Capital of South Carolina\\". The population was 12,539 at the 2010 census, with an estimated population of 12,609 in 2019. It is the principal city of the Gaffney, South Carolina, Micropolitan Statistical Area (population 55,662 according to 2012 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau), which includes all of Cherokee County and which is further included in the greater Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, South Carolina Combined Statistical Area (population 1,384,996 according to year 2012 U.S. Census Bureau estimates). History Michael A. Gaffney, born in Granard, Ireland, in 1775, emigrated to the United States in 1797, arriving in New York City and moving to Charleston, South Carolina, a few years later. Gaffney moved again in 1804 to the South Carolina Upcountry and established a tavern and lodging house at what became known as \\"Gaffney's Cross Roads\\". The location was perfect for growth because of the two major roads which met here, one from the mountains of North Carolina to Charleston and the other from Charlotte into Georgia. Michael Gaffney died here on September 6, 1854. In 1872, the area became known as \\"Gaffney City\\". Gaffney became the county seat of Cherokee County which was formed out of parts of York, Union, and Spartanburg counties in 1897. Gaffney became a major center for the textile industry in South Carolina, which was the backbone of the county's economy up until the 1980s. Despite the small amount of population growth, businesses and companies continue to locate within the city limits, especially along the bustling Floyd Baker Boulevard and Highway 105 and many other areas within the city limits. However, most population growth recently has occurred outside of the city limits. Uptown Gaffney began to languish after Interstate 85 was built in the county as industries located near the new highway. Recent renovations in downtown Gaffney have prompted more businesses to locate there, but there is still a great deal that is planned for the central part of the city. Many plans have been announced for the downtown area, including a park that is currently being developed on the grounds of a recently demolished mill (Gaffney Manufacturing Co.). A plaza has been completed beside city hall and includes a refurbished fountain and extensive landscaping. Highlights to the upgrade of the city's park system include a skatepark, two passive parks, and several children's playgrounds. In 2008, the Cherokee County History & Arts Museum opened on College Drive in the historic Central Elementary School building. The museum is operated by the Cherokee Historical & Preservation Society and is located on the mustering ground of the South Carolina militia (1812‚Äì1914). Located just blocks from downtown Gaffney and in one of the city's three nationally registered historic sites, the museum offers new cultural opportunities for locals and visitors, while having a positive economic impact for the downtown area. Annual events include a pottery show, car show, and ghost walk. The city has recently hired an architectural firm to renovate the old Gaffney Post Office, located at the intersection of Frederick and Granard streets, into a visitor's center and art gallery. There are also plans for a large cultural center to be placed in the downtown area. In 2009 Darren Mason was elected president of the Gaffney Downtown Business Association and has worked closely with city officials in revitalizing the Historic Downtown area which consists of about six blocks. New matching fund programs have been key to restoring old buildings by painting and using attractive awnings to spruce up the old look of main street. Gaffney Station Farmers' Market has been established in a city parking lot directly across from the old post office downtown. The farmers' market operates on Wednesdays and Saturdays from June through October. There are plans to create a more permanent site for the farmer's market at that location. The city of Gaffney plans to build a partial replica of the old train depot that was once located there. The replica will house a portion of the farmer's market and also act as a landmark that calls back to the days of the old depot. The city concluded Spring Session '08 of a popular concert series entitled \\"Shindig at the Gaffney Cabin\\". Bands perform on a weekly basis: Fridays during the Spring Session (May) and Thursdays during the Fall Session (late August through September). Concerts are held on Thursdays during Fall Sessions so as not to conflict with Gaffney Indian football games on Friday nights. The city will hold more of those concerts in 2009, this time from April to June 2009, and again from August to October of the same year.

The first victim, a prominent peach farmer from western Cherokee County, was killed on June 27. On July 1, the killer was responsible for the death of an 83-year-old woman and her 50-year- old daughter. The two were found bound and shot to death in the elder woman's home near Gaffney. On July 2, 46-year-old Stephen Tyler was shot and killed in his appliance and furniture store; his teenage daughter, Abby, was critically wounded; she died of her injuries two days later. The news spread quickly from the local newspaper to national and international media outlets including CNN, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal, and the BBC. On July 6, police responding to an emergency call of a burglary in progress in Gaston County, North Carolina, shot and killed a suspect who drew a gun on them, injuring one officer.

It was discovered by Andr√©-Louis Cholesky for real matrices. When it is applicable, the Cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as efficient as the LU decomposition for solving systems of linear equations.  Statement  The Cholesky decomposition of a Hermitian positive-definite matrix A, is a decomposition of the form : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{L L}^*, where L is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries, and L* denotes the conjugate transpose of L. Every Hermitian positive-definite matrix (and thus also every real-valued symmetric positive-definite matrix) has a unique Cholesky decomposition., , . The converse holds trivially: if A can be written as LL* for some invertible L, lower triangular or otherwise, then A is Hermitian and positive definite. When A is a real matrix (hence symmetric positive-definite), the factorization may be written : A = LLT, where L is a real lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries..  Positive semidefinite matrices  If a Hermitian matrix A is only positive semidefinite, instead of positive definite, then it still has a decomposition of the form A = LL* where the diagonal entries of L are allowed to be zero.. The decomposition need not be unique, for example: : \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 \\\\0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf L \\\\mathbf L^*, \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\mathbf L=\\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0\\\\ \\\\cos \\\\theta & \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\end{pmatrix}. However, if the rank of A is r, then there is a unique lower triangular L with exactly r positive diagonal elements and n-r columns containing all zeroes. Alternatively, the decomposition can be made unique when a pivoting choice is fixed. Formally, if A is an n √ó n positive semidefinite matrix of rank r, then there is at least one permutation matrix P such that P A PT has a unique decomposition of the form P A PT L L* with \\\\mathbf L = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf L_1 & 0 \\\\ \\\\mathbf L_2 & 0\\\\end{bmatrix} , where L1 is an r √ó r lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal.  LDL decomposition  A closely related variant of the classical Cholesky decomposition is the LDL decomposition, : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{L D L}^*, where L is a lower unit triangular (unitriangular) matrix, and D is a diagonal matrix. That is, the diagonal elements of L are required to be 1 at the cost of introducing an additional diagonal matrix D in the decomposition. The main advantage is that the LDL decomposition can be computed and used with essentially the same algorithms, but avoids extracting square roots. For this reason, the LDL decomposition is often called the square-root-free Cholesky decomposition. For real matrices, the factorization has the form A = LDLT and is often referred to as LDLT decomposition (or LDLT decomposition, or LDL‚Ä≤). It is closely related to the eigendecomposition of real symmetric matrices, A = QŒõQT. The LDL decomposition is related to the classical Cholesky decomposition of the form LL* as follows: : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{L D L}^* = \\\\mathbf L \\\\mathbf D^{1/2} (\\\\mathbf D^{1/2})^* \\\\mathbf L^* = \\\\mathbf L \\\\mathbf D^{1/2} (\\\\mathbf L \\\\mathbf D^{1/2})^*. Conversely, given the classical Cholesky decomposition \\\\mathbf A = \\\\mathbf C \\\\mathbf C^* of a positive definite matrix, if S is a diagonal matrix that contains the main diagonal of \\\\mathbf C, then a A can be decomposed as \\\\mathbf L \\\\mathbf D \\\\mathbf L^* where : \\\\mathbf L = \\\\mathbf C \\\\mathbf S^{-1} (this rescales each column to makes diagonal elements 1), : \\\\mathbf D = \\\\mathbf S^2. If A is positive definite then the diagonal elements of D are all positive. For positive semidefinite A, an \\\\mathbf L \\\\mathbf D \\\\mathbf L^* decomposition exists where the number of non-zero elements on the diagonal D is exactly the rank of A. Some indefinite matrices for which no Cholesky decomposition exists have an LDL decomposition with negative entries in D: it suffices that the first n-1 leading principal minors of A are non- singular.  Example  Here is the Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric real matrix: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{3}{r}} 4 & 12 & -16 \\\\ 12 & 37 & -43 \\\\ -16 & -43 & 98 \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{3}{r}} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 6 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -8 & 5 & 3 \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{3}{r}} 2 & 6 & -8 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 3 \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right). \\\\end{align} And here is its LDLT decomposition: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{3}{r}} 4 & 12 & -16 \\\\ 12 & 37 & -43 \\\\ -16 & -43 & 98 \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right) & = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{3}{r}} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -4 & 5 & 1 \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{3}{r}} 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 9 \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{3}{r}} 1 & 3 & -4 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right). \\\\end{align}  Applications  The Cholesky decomposition is mainly used for the numerical solution of linear equations \\\\mathbf{Ax} = \\\\mathbf{b}. If A is symmetric and positive definite, then we can solve \\\\mathbf{Ax} = \\\\mathbf{b} by first computing the Cholesky decomposition \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{LL}^\\\\mathrm{*}, then solving \\\\mathbf{Ly} = \\\\mathbf{b} for y by forward substitution, and finally solving \\\\mathbf{L^*x} = \\\\mathbf{y} for x by back substitution. An alternative way to eliminate taking square roots in the \\\\mathbf{LL}^\\\\mathrm{*} decomposition is to compute the Cholesky decomposition \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{LDL}^\\\\mathrm{*}, then solving \\\\mathbf{Ly} = \\\\mathbf{b} for y, and finally solving \\\\mathbf{DL}^\\\\mathrm{*}\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{y}. For linear systems that can be put into symmetric form, the Cholesky decomposition (or its LDL variant) is the method of choice, for superior efficiency and numerical stability. Compared to the LU decomposition, it is roughly twice as efficient. Linear least squares Systems of the form Ax = b with A symmetric and positive definite arise quite often in applications. For instance, the normal equations in linear least squares problems are of this form. It may also happen that matrix A comes from an energy functional, which must be positive from physical considerations; this happens frequently in the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Non-linear optimization Non-linear multi-variate functions may be minimized over their parameters using variants of Newton's method called quasi-Newton methods. At iteration k, the search steps in a direction p_k defined by solving B_k p_k = -g_k for p_k , where p_k is the step direction, g_k is the gradient, and B_k is an approximation to the Hessian matrix formed by repeating rank-1 updates at each iteration. Two well-known update formulas are called Davidon‚ÄìFletcher‚ÄìPowell (DFP) and Broyden‚ÄìFletcher‚ÄìGoldfarb‚ÄìShanno (BFGS). Loss of the positive-definite condition through round-off error is avoided if rather than updating an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian, one updates the Cholesky decomposition of an approximation of the Hessian matrix itself .Arora, J.S. Introduction to Optimum Design (2004), p. 327. https://books.google.com/books?id=9FbwVe577xwC&pg;=PA327 Monte Carlo simulation The Cholesky decomposition is commonly used in the Monte Carlo method for simulating systems with multiple correlated variables. The covariance matrix is decomposed to give the lower-triangular L. Applying this to a vector of uncorrelated samples u produces a sample vector Lu with the covariance properties of the system being modeled.Matlab randn documentation. mathworks.com. The following simplified example shows the economy one gets from the Cholesky decomposition: suppose the goal is to generate two correlated normal variables x_1 and x_2 with given correlation coefficient \\\\rho. To accomplish that, it is necessary to first generate two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables z_1 and z_2, which can be done using a Box‚ÄìMuller transform. Given the required correlation coefficient \\\\rho, the correlated normal variables can be obtained via the transformations x_1 = z_1 and x_2 = \\\\rho z_1 + \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\rho^2} z_2. Kalman filters Unscented Kalman filters commonly use the Cholesky decomposition to choose a set of so-called sigma points. The Kalman filter tracks the average state of a system as a vector x of length N and covariance as an N √ó N matrix P. The matrix P is always positive semi-definite and can be decomposed into LLT. The columns of L can be added and subtracted from the mean x to form a set of 2N vectors called sigma points. These sigma points completely capture the mean and covariance of the system state. Matrix inversion The explicit inverse of a Hermitian matrix can be computed by Cholesky decomposition, in a manner similar to solving linear systems, using n^3 operations (\\\\tfrac{1}{2} n^3 multiplications). The entire inversion can even be efficiently performed in- place. A non-Hermitian matrix B can also be inverted using the following identity, where BB* will always be Hermitian: : \\\\mathbf{B}^{-1} = \\\\mathbf{B}^* (\\\\mathbf{B B}^*)^{-1}.  Computation  There are various methods for calculating the Cholesky decomposition. The computational complexity of commonly used algorithms is O(n3) in general. The algorithms described below all involve about n3/3 FLOPs (n3/6 multiplications and the same number of additions), where n is the size of the matrix A. Hence, they have half the cost of the LU decomposition, which uses 2n3/3 FLOPs (see Trefethen and Bau 1997). Which of the algorithms below is faster depends on the details of the implementation. Generally, the first algorithm will be slightly slower because it accesses the data in a less regular manner.  The Cholesky algorithm  The Cholesky algorithm, used to calculate the decomposition matrix L, is a modified version of Gaussian elimination. The recursive algorithm starts with i := 1 and :A(1) := A. At step i, the matrix A(i) has the following form: :\\\\mathbf{A}^{(i)}= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & a_{i,i} & \\\\mathbf{b}_{i}^{*} \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf{b}_{i} & \\\\mathbf{B}^{(i)} \\\\end{pmatrix}, where Ii‚àí1 denotes the identity matrix of dimension i ‚àí 1. If we now define the matrix Li by :\\\\mathbf{L}_{i}:= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\sqrt{a_{i,i}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{a_{i,i}}} \\\\mathbf{b}_{i} & \\\\mathbf{I}_{n-i} \\\\end{pmatrix}, then we can write A(i) as :\\\\mathbf{A}^{(i)} = \\\\mathbf{L}_{i} \\\\mathbf{A}^{(i+1)} \\\\mathbf{L}_{i}^{*} where :\\\\mathbf{A}^{(i+1)}= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{I}_{i-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\mathbf{B}^{(i)} - \\\\frac{1}{a_{i,i}} \\\\mathbf{b}_{i} \\\\mathbf{b}_{i}^{*} \\\\end{pmatrix}. Note that bi b*i is an outer product, therefore this algorithm is called the outer-product version in (Golub & Van Loan). We repeat this for i from 1 to n. After n steps, we get A(n+1) = I. Hence, the lower triangular matrix L we are looking for is calculated as :\\\\mathbf{L} := \\\\mathbf{L}_{1} \\\\mathbf{L}_{2} \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{L}_{n}.  The Cholesky‚ÄìBanachiewicz and Cholesky‚ÄìCrout algorithms  Access pattern (white) and writing pattern (yellow) for the in-place Cholesky‚ÄîBanachiewicz algorithm on a 5√ó5 matrix If we write out the equation :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{LL}^T & = \\\\begin{pmatrix} L_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\ L_{21} & L_{22} & 0 \\\\ L_{31} & L_{32} & L_{33}\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} L_{11} & L_{21} & L_{31} \\\\ 0 & L_{22} & L_{32} \\\\ 0 & 0 & L_{33} \\\\end{pmatrix} [8pt] & = \\\\begin{pmatrix} L_{11}^2 & &(\\\\text{symmetric}) \\\\ L_{21}L_{11} & L_{21}^2 + L_{22}^2& \\\\ L_{31}L_{11} & L_{31}L_{21}+L_{32}L_{22} & L_{31}^2 + L_{32}^2+L_{33}^2 \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\end{align} we obtain the following: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\sqrt{A_{11}} & 0 & 0 \\\\ A_{21}/L_{11} & \\\\sqrt{A_{22} - L_{21}^2} & 0 \\\\ A_{31}/L_{11} & \\\\left( A_{32} - L_{31}L_{21} \\\\right) /L_{22} &\\\\sqrt{A_{33}- L_{31}^2 - L_{32}^2} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\end{align} and therefore the following formulas for the entries of L: : L_{j,j} = (\\\\pm)\\\\sqrt{ A_{j,j} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{j,k}^2 }, : L_{i,j} = \\\\frac{1}{L_{j,j}} \\\\left( A_{i,j} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{i,k} L_{j,k} \\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } i>j. For complex and real matrices, inconsequential arbitrary sign changes of diagonal and associated off-diagonal elements are allowed. The expression under the square root is always positive if A is real and positive-definite. For complex Hermitian matrix, the following formula applies: : L_{j,j} = \\\\sqrt{ A_{j,j} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{j,k}L_{j,k}^* }, : L_{i,j} = \\\\frac{1}{L_{j,j}} \\\\left( A_{i,j} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{i,k} L_{j,k}^* \\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } i>j. So we can compute the (i, j) entry if we know the entries to the left and above. The computation is usually arranged in either of the following orders: * The Cholesky‚ÄìBanachiewicz algorithm starts from the upper left corner of the matrix L and proceeds to calculate the matrix row by row. * The Cholesky‚ÄìCrout algorithm starts from the upper left corner of the matrix L and proceeds to calculate the matrix column by column. Either pattern of access allows the entire computation to be performed in-place if desired.  Stability of the computation  Suppose that we want to solve a well-conditioned system of linear equations. If the LU decomposition is used, then the algorithm is unstable unless we use some sort of pivoting strategy. In the latter case, the error depends on the so-called growth factor of the matrix, which is usually (but not always) small. Now, suppose that the Cholesky decomposition is applicable. As mentioned above, the algorithm will be twice as fast. Furthermore, no pivoting is necessary, and the error will always be small. Specifically, if we want to solve Ax = b, and y denotes the computed solution, then y solves the perturbed system (A + E)y = b, where : mathbf{E}\\\\_2 \\\\le c_n \\\\varepsilon mathbf{A}\\\\_2. Here ¬∑2 is the matrix 2-norm, cn is a small constant depending on n, and Œµ denotes the unit round-off. One concern with the Cholesky decomposition to be aware of is the use of square roots. If the matrix being factorized is positive definite as required, the numbers under the square roots are always positive in exact arithmetic. Unfortunately, the numbers can become negative because of round- off errors, in which case the algorithm cannot continue. However, this can only happen if the matrix is very ill-conditioned. One way to address this is to add a diagonal correction matrix to the matrix being decomposed in an attempt to promote the positive-definiteness. While this might lessen the accuracy of the decomposition, it can be very favorable for other reasons; for example, when performing Newton's method in optimization, adding a diagonal matrix can improve stability when far from the optimum.  LDL decomposition  An alternative form, eliminating the need to take square roots when A is symmetric, is the symmetric indefinite factorization : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{LDL}^\\\\mathrm{T} & = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ L_{21} & 1 & 0 \\\\ L_{31} & L_{32} & 1\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} D_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & D_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & D_3\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & L_{21} & L_{31} \\\\ 0 & 1 & L_{32} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} [8pt] & = \\\\begin{pmatrix} D_1 & &(\\\\mathrm{symmetric}) \\\\ L_{21}D_1 & L_{21}^2D_1 + D_2& \\\\ L_{31}D_1 & L_{31}L_{21}D_{1}+L_{32}D_2 & L_{31}^2D_1 + L_{32}^2D_2+D_3. \\\\end{pmatrix}. \\\\end{align} The following recursive relations apply for the entries of D and L: : D_j = A_{jj} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{jk}^2 D_k, : L_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{D_j} \\\\left( A_{ij} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{ik} L_{jk} D_k \\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } i>j. This works as long as the generated diagonal elements in D stay non-zero. The decomposition is then unique. D and L are real if A is real. For complex Hermitian matrix A, the following formula applies: : D_{j} = A_{jj} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{jk}L_{jk}^* D_k, : L_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{D_j} \\\\left( A_{ij} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} L_{ik} L_{jk}^* D_k \\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } i>j. Again, the pattern of access allows the entire computation to be performed in- place if desired. Block variant When used on indefinite matrices, the LDL* factorization is known to be unstable without careful pivoting; specifically, the elements of the factorization can grow arbitrarily. A possible improvement is to perform the factorization on block sub-matrices, commonly 2 √ó 2: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{LDL}^\\\\mathrm{T} & = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf I & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\\\mathbf L_{21} & \\\\mathbf I & 0 \\\\ \\\\mathbf L_{31} & \\\\mathbf L_{32} & \\\\mathbf I\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf D_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf D_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\mathbf D_3\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf I & \\\\mathbf L_{21}^\\\\mathrm T & \\\\mathbf L_{31}^\\\\mathrm T \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf I & \\\\mathbf L_{32}^\\\\mathrm T \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\mathbf I\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} [8pt] & = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf D_1 & &(\\\\mathrm{symmetric}) \\\\ \\\\mathbf L_{21} \\\\mathbf D_1 & \\\\mathbf L_{21} \\\\mathbf D_1 \\\\mathbf L_{21}^\\\\mathrm T + \\\\mathbf D_2& \\\\ \\\\mathbf L_{31} \\\\mathbf D_1 & \\\\mathbf L_{31} \\\\mathbf D_{1} \\\\mathbf L_{21}^\\\\mathrm T + \\\\mathbf L_{32} \\\\mathbf D_2 & \\\\mathbf L_{31} \\\\mathbf D_1 \\\\mathbf L_{31}^\\\\mathrm T + \\\\mathbf L_{32} \\\\mathbf D_2 \\\\mathbf L_{32}^\\\\mathrm T + \\\\mathbf D_3 \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\end{align} where every element in the matrices above is a square submatrix. From this, these analogous recursive relations follow: :\\\\mathbf D_j = \\\\mathbf A_{jj} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \\\\mathbf L_{jk} \\\\mathbf D_k \\\\mathbf L_{jk}^\\\\mathrm T, :\\\\mathbf L_{ij} = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf A_{ij} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \\\\mathbf L_{ik} \\\\mathbf D_k \\\\mathbf L_{jk}^\\\\mathrm T\\\\right) \\\\mathbf D_j^{-1}. This involves matrix products and explicit inversion, thus limiting the practical block size. Updating the decomposition A task that often arises in practice is that one needs to update a Cholesky decomposition. In more details, one has already computed the Cholesky decomposition \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{L}\\\\mathbf{L}^* of some matrix \\\\mathbf{A}, then one changes the matrix \\\\mathbf{A} in some way into another matrix, say \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} , and one wants to compute the Cholesky decomposition of the updated matrix: \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} = \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{L}} \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{L}}^* . The question is now whether one can use the Cholesky decomposition of \\\\mathbf{A} that was computed before to compute the Cholesky decomposition of \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} . = Rank-one update = The specific case, where the updated matrix \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} is related to the matrix \\\\mathbf{A} by \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} = \\\\mathbf{A} + \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mathbf{x}^* , is known as a rank-one update. Here is a little functionBased on: written in Matlab syntax that realizes a rank-one update: function [L] = cholupdate(L, x) n = length(x); for k = 1:n r = sqrt(L(k, k)^2 + x(k)^2); c = r / L(k, k); s = x(k) / L(k, k); L(k, k) = r; if k < n L((k+1):n, k) = (L((k+1):n, k) + s * x((k+1):n)) / c; x((k+1):n) = c * x((k+1):n) - s * L((k+1):n, k); end end end = Rank-one downdate = A rank-one downdate is similar to a rank-one update, except that the addition is replaced by subtraction: \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} = \\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mathbf{x}^* . This only works if the new matrix \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} is still positive definite. The code for the rank-one update shown above can easily be adapted to do a rank-one downdate: one merely needs to replace the two additions in the assignment to \` r \` and \` L((k+1):n, k) \` by subtractions. = Adding and removing rows and columns = If we have a symmetric and positive definite matrix \\\\mathbf A represented in block form as : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf A_{11} & \\\\mathbf A_{13} \\\\ \\\\mathbf A_{13}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & \\\\mathbf A_{33} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} and its upper Cholesky factor : \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf L_{11} & \\\\mathbf L_{13} \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf L_{33} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}, then for a new matrix \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} , which is the same as \\\\mathbf A but with the insertion of new rows and columns, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} &= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf A_{11} & \\\\mathbf A_{12} & \\\\mathbf A_{13} \\\\ \\\\mathbf A_{12}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & \\\\mathbf A_{22} & \\\\mathbf A_{23} \\\\ \\\\mathbf A_{13}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & \\\\mathbf A_{23}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & \\\\mathbf A_{33} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\end{align} we are interested in finding the Cholesky factorisation of \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} , which we call \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf S} , without directly computing the entire decomposition. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{S}} &= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf S_{11} & \\\\mathbf S_{12} & \\\\mathbf S_{13} \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf S_{22} & \\\\mathbf S_{23} \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\mathbf S_{33} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. \\\\end{align} Writing \\\\mathbf A \\\\setminus \\\\mathbf{b} for the solution of \\\\mathbf A \\\\mathbf x = \\\\mathbf b, which can be found easily for triangular matrices, and \\\\text{chol} (\\\\mathbf M) for the Cholesky decomposition of \\\\mathbf M , the following relations can be found: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf S_{11} &= \\\\mathbf L_{11}, \\\\ \\\\mathbf S_{12} &= \\\\mathbf L_{11}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\setminus \\\\mathbf A_{12}, \\\\ \\\\mathbf S_{13} &= \\\\mathbf L_{13}, \\\\ \\\\mathbf S_{22} &= \\\\text{chol} (\\\\mathbf A_{22} - \\\\mathbf S_{12}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf S_{12}), \\\\ \\\\mathbf S_{23} &= \\\\mathbf S_{22}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\setminus (\\\\mathbf A_{23} - \\\\mathbf S_{12}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf S_{13}), \\\\ \\\\mathbf S_{33} &= \\\\text{chol} (\\\\mathbf L_{33}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf L_{33} - \\\\mathbf S_{23}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf S_{23}). \\\\ \\\\end{align} These formulas may be used to determine the Cholesky factor after the insertion of rows or columns in any position, if we set the row and column dimensions appropriately (including to zero). The inverse problem, when we have :\\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} &= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf A_{11} & \\\\mathbf A_{12} & \\\\mathbf A_{13} \\\\ \\\\mathbf A_{12}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & \\\\mathbf A_{22} & \\\\mathbf A_{23} \\\\ \\\\mathbf A_{13}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & \\\\mathbf A_{23}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & \\\\mathbf A_{33} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\end{align} with known Cholesky decomposition :\\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{S}} &= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf S_{11} & \\\\mathbf S_{12} & \\\\mathbf S_{13} \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf S_{22} & \\\\mathbf S_{23} \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\mathbf S_{33} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\end{align} and wish to determine the Cholesky factor :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{L} &= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf L_{11} & \\\\mathbf L_{13} \\\\ 0 & \\\\mathbf L_{33} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\end{align} of the matrix \\\\mathbf A with rows and columns removed, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{A} &= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf A_{11} & \\\\mathbf A_{13} \\\\ \\\\mathbf A_{13}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} & \\\\mathbf A_{33} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\end{align} yields the following rules: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf L_{11} &= \\\\mathbf S_{11}, \\\\ \\\\mathbf L_{13} &= \\\\mathbf S_{13}, \\\\ \\\\mathbf L_{33} &= \\\\text{chol} (\\\\mathbf S_{33} + \\\\mathbf S_{23}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf S_{23}). \\\\end{align} Notice that the equations above that involve finding the Cholesky decomposition of a new matrix are all of the form \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{A}} = \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\pm \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mathbf{x}^* , which allows them to be efficiently calculated using the update and downdate procedures detailed in the previous section.Osborne, M. (2010), Appendix B.  Proof for positive semi-definite matrices = Proof by limiting argument  The above algorithms show that every positive definite matrix \\\\mathbf{A} has a Cholesky decomposition. This result can be extended to the positive semi-definite case by a limiting argument. The argument is not fully constructive, i.e., it gives no explicit numerical algorithms for computing Cholesky factors. If \\\\mathbf{A} is an n \\\\times n positive semi- definite matrix, then the sequence \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}_k\\\\right)_k := \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} + \\\\frac{1}{k} \\\\mathbf{I}_n\\\\right)_k consists of positive definite matrices. (This is an immediate consequence of, for example, the spectral mapping theorem for the polynomial functional calculus.) Also, : \\\\mathbf{A}_k \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\quad \\\\text{for} \\\\quad k \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty in operator norm. From the positive definite case, each \\\\mathbf{A}_k has Cholesky decomposition \\\\mathbf{A}_k = \\\\mathbf{L}_k\\\\mathbf{L}_k^* . By property of the operator norm, :\\\\ \\\\mathbf{L}_k \\\\^2 \\\\geq \\\\ \\\\mathbf{L}_k \\\\mathbf{L}_k^* \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_k \\\\ \\\\,. So \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{L}_k \\\\right)_k is a bounded set in the Banach space of operators, therefore relatively compact (because the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional). Consequently, it has a convergent subsequence, also denoted by \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{L}_k \\\\right)_k, with limit \\\\mathbf{L}. It can be easily checked that this \\\\mathbf{L} has the desired properties, i.e. \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{L}\\\\mathbf{L}^* , and \\\\mathbf{L} is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries: for all x and y, : \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{A} x, y \\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\lim \\\\mathbf{A}_k x, y \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\lim \\\\mathbf{L}_k \\\\mathbf{L}_k^* x, y \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\mathbf{L}^*x, y \\\\rangle \\\\,. Therefore, \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{L}\\\\mathbf{L}^* . Because the underlying vector space is finite- dimensional, all topologies on the space of operators are equivalent. So \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{L}_k \\\\right)_k tends to \\\\mathbf{L} in norm means \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{L}_k \\\\right)_k tends to \\\\mathbf{L} entrywise. This in turn implies that, since each \\\\mathbf{L}_k is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries, \\\\mathbf{L} is also.  Proof by QR decomposition  Let \\\\mathbf{A} be a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix. Then it can be written as a product of its square root matrix, \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\mathbf{B}^*. Now QR decomposition can be applied to \\\\mathbf{B}^*, resulting in \\\\mathbf{B}^* = \\\\mathbf{Q}\\\\mathbf{R} , where \\\\mathbf{Q} is unitary and \\\\mathbf{R} is upper triangular. Inserting the decomposition into the original equality yields A = \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\mathbf{B}^* = (\\\\mathbf{QR})^*\\\\mathbf{QR} = \\\\mathbf{R}^*\\\\mathbf{Q}^*\\\\mathbf{QR} = \\\\mathbf{R}^*\\\\mathbf{R}. Setting \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\mathbf{R}^* completes the proof.  Generalization  The Cholesky factorization can be generalized to (not necessarily finite) matrices with operator entries. Let {\\\\mathcal{H}_n } be a sequence of Hilbert spaces. Consider the operator matrix : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{A}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{12} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{13} & \\\\; \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_{12}^* & \\\\mathbf{A}_{22} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{23} & \\\\; \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A} _{13}^* & \\\\mathbf{A}_{23}^* & \\\\mathbf{A}_{33} & \\\\; \\\\ \\\\; & \\\\; & \\\\; & \\\\ddots \\\\end{bmatrix} acting on the direct sum :\\\\mathcal{H} = \\\\bigoplus_n \\\\mathcal{H}_n, where each :\\\\mathbf{A}_{ij} : \\\\mathcal{H}_j \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{H} _i is a bounded operator. If A is positive (semidefinite) in the sense that for all finite k and for any :h \\\\in \\\\bigoplus_{n = 1}^k \\\\mathcal{H}_k , we have \\\\langle h, \\\\mathbf{A} h\\\\rangle \\\\ge 0, then there exists a lower triangular operator matrix L such that A = LL*. One can also take the diagonal entries of L to be positive.

The population was 5,851 at the 2010 census and has the lowest per capita income level of any municipality of 5,000 or more residents in the Pee Dee region. It has been nicknamed \\"The Prettiest Town in Dixie\\". The harbor tug USS Cheraw was named in the town's honor. History=Origins When the first Europeans arrived in the area it was inhabited by the Cheraw and Pee Dee American Indian tribes. The Cheraw lived near the waterfall hill, near present-day Cheraw, but by the 1730s they had been devastated by new infectious disease inadvertently carried by the European traders. Survivors joined the Catawba Confederacy for safety and left their name in history. Only a few scattered Cheraw families remained by the time of the American Revolution. A few European settlers entered their territory in the 1730s, forced upriver when the Welsh came to claim the Welsh Baptist lands granted by the English government in the area around Society Hill. Many of the early settlers of the 1740s in Cheraw were ethnic English, Scots, French Huguenots, or Scots-Irish. By 1750, Cheraw had become an established Anglo-American village with a growing river trade, one of the first inland villages. It was one of only six places in South Carolina that appeared on English maps at the time. In the 1760s, Joseph and Eli Kershaw were granted the part of Cheraw that is now the downtown historic district. The Kershaws laid out a formal street system. By 1830 settlers lined all the streets with rows of elms. The Kershaws originally called the town \\"Chatham\\", but people never accepted this name, continuing to call it \\"Cheraw\\" or \\"Cheraw Hill\\". American Revolution There was a lack of organization and rule during the beginning of the 1740s in the backcountry of South Carolina. This lack of organization and unrest was an underlying cause of the resentment people of these areas felt toward the British Crown. In the Pee Dee area, planters organized a group called the Regulators to help bring order to the area. In 1768 St. David's Parish, the last Anglican Church built in South Carolina under King George III, was established to help serve the civic and religious needs of the Cheraw area. Later a judicial district and courthouse were established to help deal with the problem of order. However, there was still much discontent with the ruling authority, and in May 1776 the grand jury of the Cheraws District Two declared its independence from Great Britain. Many area men played prominent roles in the American Revolution. They included Claudius Pegues, General Henry W. Harrington, the Ellerbe brothers, Philip Pledger, and Eli Kershaw. There was much unrest in the area during this time because Cheraw fell into part of the British strategic line of defense, where garrisons were built to control revolutionaries and to encourage loyalists. Other towns in this line of defense included Camden, South Carolina, and Augusta, Georgia. Cheraw also became a strategic point for the Americans. Military activity was especially heavy in Cheraw and surrounding counties from 1780-1781. During the Revolutionary War, St. David's Church was used as a hospital for British troops that operated under Lord Cornwallis's command and as quarters for the South Carolina militia. In December 1780, just across from Cheraw, American commander General Nathanael Greene set up a \\"camp of repose\\" to rest and train his men. Early 19th century In 1819, the first steamboat came up river, and along with it a burst of prosperity because of expanded trade. Cheraw was incorporated as a town in 1820. The main crops from the Cheraw area were corn, cotton, tobacco, rice and indigo. Cheraw had the largest cotton market between Georgetown, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. Because of the cotton trade, the town boasted the largest bank in South Carolina outside of Charleston before the Civil War. Despite a serious fire in 1835, by 1850 the town was a prosperous center of trade. Civil War Leading up to the Civil War, Cheraw citizens played a key role in South Carolina's secession from the Union. On November 19, 1860, the first call for secession in a public meeting was made at the Chesterfield County Courthouse. John A. Inglis of Cheraw was in attendance. He later introduced the resolution for South Carolina to secede. Inglis was also named the chairman of the committee that wrote the document for South Carolina's secession. From the beginning of the war, Cheraw was known as a place of refuge and a storehouse for valuables. In March 1865, General William T. Sherman brought his Union troops to Cheraw for several days. One Union soldier said that they found Cheraw to be \\"a pleasant town and an old one with the Southern aristocratic bearing.\\" Sherman used this as a time to gain more control over his men. No private dwellings or public buildings in Cheraw were destroyed by Sherman and his troops. However, an accidental explosion of captured gunpowder at the river hill burned the Cheraw business district. The county courthouse in Chesterfield was burned in this event, resulting in the loss of many records. Thus, it is difficult to date many of the historic properties. During the Civil War, St. David's Church was used as a hospital by both the Confederate and Union armies. Some troops from both armies were buried there. The first Confederate monument was erected there in 1867, a claim disputed by Romney, West Virginia. Originally, the monument did not mention the Confederate soldiers because the area was still occupied by Federal troops. 20th century to present The Civil War caused great economic hardship in Cheraw, as it did in the entire South. However, by the early 1900s, prosperity began to return to Cheraw. The Great Depression again brought change. Cheraw State Park and Sandhills State Forest were both founded in the 1930s. By the 1950s and 1960s the groundwork was laid for industrial growth. By the end of the 20th century, Cheraw had a balanced industrial base while maintaining its historic charm, architectural treasures and natural resources. In November, 1941, Cheraw saw pretend combat in its streets during the Battle of Pee Dee River, Phase 1 of the Carolina Maneuvers. General George Patton's 2nd Armored Division was the (Red) attacking force versus Major General Charles F. Thompson's I Corps defending (Blue). Tanks from Patton's division penetrated the defenses and entered the city center to be met by defending anti-tank guns. It was determined that Red's tanks were successful and Blue forces were forced to withdraw from the town.Page 139, \\"The U.S. Army GHQ Maneuvers of 1941\\", Christopher R.

Brewer Gold Company owns approximately 1,000 acres of land along a small north-south ridgeline that divides Little Fork Creek and the Lynches River. About one-quarter of the 1,000 acres has been disturbed by mining operations. Brewer Gold Mine was one of the oldest and most productive gold mines in the eastern United States. Activities at Brewer are rumored to date to the 16th century involving Indian trade with the Spaniards. Before the Revolutionary War, the area was mined for iron. The first documented discovery of gold took place by Burrell Brewer in 1828. Brewer Gold Company, a subsidiary owned by the British Costain Limited Group (Costain), secured ownership of the mine in 1986, with the first gold production occurring in August 1987. Ore was mined using conventional open pit methods until January 1995. Rock was first fractured using drilling and blasting, and then loaded into trucks. Waste rock was used as fill for facility construction or hauled to a disposal area to the south of the Brewer Pit. Ore was hauled to the crushing area where processing for the cyanide heap-leach method began. The crushed ore was then placed on pads and a dilute cyanide solution was sprayed over the heaps and allowed to percolate through the ore, thereby dissolving the gold into solution.

History Building of the McBee to Wagram railroad in 1910 McBee 1920s Main Street Origin McBee was named after a railroad executive, V.E. \\"Bunch\\" McBee, born July 26, 1849, in Greenville County, South Carolina. Bunch McBee was one of South Carolina's leading forces in the building of railroads, was responsible for the Columbia to Hamlet, North Carolina, line, which runs through McBee, and was at one time superintendent of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. 20th century In 1900, McBee's first railroad depot was built. About one year later on October 8, 1901, McBee was incorporated. On June 30, 1901, McBee Presbyterian Church was built, the first church in McBee. Six years later in 1907 McBee's second church, McBee Methodist Church, was built. After the Seaboard's Columbia-to- Cheraw line was completed in 1900, McBee grew so quickly that a new depot became a high priority by the end of the decade. In 1914, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad built a second depot in McBee. This was both a passenger and freight depot until it closed in 1971. Now it is the McBee Depot Library and Railroad Museum. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 as the Seaboard Air Line Railway Depot in McBee.Seaboard Air Line Railway Depot; hmdb.orgMcBee Library and Railroad Museum; sciway.net In 1980, the railroad became a subsidiary of the newly created CSX Corporation, and in 1986 the Seaboard name was changed to CSX Transportation. In 1945, U.S. Route 1 through McBee was named the Blue Star Memorial Highway Number 6. McBee Rescue was originally formed in 1962 as a joint venture with Jefferson Rescue to fill the need of rescue - ambulance service in the area. The ambulance was rotated between McBee and Jefferson and responded to the appropriate area as needed. The ambulance was originally parked on the street corner in McBee and later at the Health Center prior to constructing the current squad building. Prior to the ambulance, the only means of transport to the hospital was by personal vehicle or by the funeral home hearse, which had to come from Hartsville. Approximately one year later McBee and Jefferson split and formed their own respective squads and each purchased an ambulance. In 1973, the town of McBee purchased a second engine for the McBee Fire Department. In 1986, Alligator Fire District was formed with McBee Fire Department. 21st century In 2001, McBee celebrated its 100-year anniversary. In 2001 McBee Elementary School was re-modeled.

The population was 4,108 as of the 2010 census, with an estimated population in 2018 of 3,941. It was named after former South Carolina governor John Laurence Manning. History In 1855, the South Carolina Legislature appointed a group of commissioners to select and purchase a tract of land for \\"the Village of Manning\\" in the newly formed Clarendon County. According to the Watchmen, a local newspaper of the time, \\"the Legislature (had) granted a bill of divorce between Clarendon and Claremont (Sumter).\\" Thirteen men were named as commissioners to select and acquire from on which to lay out the new courthouse village: R. C. Baker, L. F. Rhame, J. C. Brock, W. W. Owens, Joseph Sprott, J. C. Burgess, M. T. Brogdon, J. J. Nelson, Samuel A. Burgess, J. J. McFadden, Jesse Hill, R. R. Haynsworth, and P. S. Worsham. Five other commissioners, R. I. Manning, L. F. Rhame, J. B. Brogdon, J. J. Conyers, and William A. Burgess, were later named when it came time to erect the courthouse and jail from a state appropriation of $18,000, plus whatever funds might be realized from the sale of lots. The site for the village was presented to the state by Captain Joseph Copley Burgess, and the Plat of Manning was prepared and filed in Sumter County Courthouse. (Captain Burgess had also donated land for the courthouse and jail in Manning.) On the second Monday of the following October, the new district officers were elected, and Clarendon began to operate independently from Sumter District with Manning as its county seat. The city was named for John Lawrence Manning, who was elected to both chambers in the General Assembly. He was later chosen by the Assembly to serve as Governor of South Carolina from 1852 to 1854. George Allen Huggins was the first intendant (mayor) of Manning. Manning's Post Office was established in 1856, and Thomas S. Coogler was appointed as the first Postmaster. Manning's first library, the Hannah Levi Memorial Library, was completed in 1910. It was funded by the children of Moses and Hannah Levi, and by the sale of the Moses Levi Institute. They named it in honor of their mother. It eventually became known as the Manning Library and was the only public library in the county. It became a county library in 1976 and continued to operate until the opening of the Harvin Clarendon County Library in 1984. The building now houses the Clarendon County Archives and History Center. Manning was severely damaged several times over its history. A large portion of the original town, including the courthouse, was destroyed in the Civil War in 1865 during what is known as \\"Potter's Raid\\". This raid by Union troops took place only a few days before Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Manning was later struck by a downtown fire in 1895 and damaged by a tornado in 1915. Pauline Clyburn, rehabilitation client, and her children stringing tobacco, photographed by Marion Post Wolcott (June 1939) Railroads, abundant timber and diverse agriculture allowed Manning to flourish during the late 19th century and into the 20th century. In 1933, Highway 4 was changed to U.S. Route 301 and thanks in part to the efforts of Manning resident W. P. Legg, Manning and Clarendon County became a preferred route of the Washington to Florida motorist. Manning is along the I-95 corridor and attracts retirees looking for various recreational activities and mild climates. As early as 1960 Manning was one of many towns across the South for the staging of peaceful Civil Rights demonstrations and sit-ins. Unlike in some other areas, the demonstrations in Manning occurred without significant incident, but helped belie the local media's message that black Carolinians accepted the status quo. Manning and the surrounding region was still adjusting to the decisions handed down in the Briggs v. Elliott and Brown v. Board of Education rulings against racial segregation in schools. In 1969 Pansy Ridgeway became the first woman to be elected mayor of Manning. She served as mayor of Manning from 1970‚Äì96 and was the third woman elected mayor in South Carolina and the first woman elected president of the South Carolina Municipal Association. Government The city government consists of a mayor and a city council. The mayor is elected at-large, and the council consists of six members who are elected from each of six districts. Manning is represented in the South Carolina Senate by Kevin L. Johnson. It is part of South Carolina's 6th congressional district which since January 1993 has been represented by Jim Clyburn. Media Manning is home to The Manning Timesmanninglive.com newspaper. It is published weekly and is updated online daily. Education Manning maintained school systems, one for black students and one for whites until court-ordered integration caused Manning Training School (for blacks) to merge with all white Manning High School in 1970. At that time, Manning Training School became Manning Middle School, then later Manning Elementary. In response, an all-white private school, Laurence Manning Academy was created. Manning is also the location of the F.E. DuBose Campus of Central Carolina Technical College.The F.E. DuBose Campus of Central Carolina Technical College Manning has a lending library, the Clarendon County Public Library. Geography Manning is located near the center of Clarendon County at (33.693998, -80.215408). It is just to the east of Interstate 95 and at the intersection of U.S. 301 and U.S. 521.

The town was officially chartered by the South Carolina legislative delegation on Christmas Eve, 1889. Summerton is well known for the court case Briggs v. Elliott (Court citation:347 US 483). Briggs was the first filed of the four court cases combined into Brown v. Board of Education, the famous case in which the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954 officially overturned racial segregation in U.S. public schools. Despite the outcome of Briggs and Brown, as of 2004 Summerton's schools remain effectively segregated, with nearly all white students now attending the private Clarendon Hall, leaving the public schools almost entirely African-American. As of 2004, 95% of public high school students at Scotts Branch High are black, despite 40% white population in the community. Today, Summerton is still noted for being a summer retreat and vacation spot for visitors interested in nature and outdoor recreation activities, e.g. golf, fishing, hunting, boating, camping.

Turbeville, son of Michael, purchased approximately from John McFaddin and built the first house in what is now the town of Turbeville. His brother, Clem, likewise bought land and built next to William. Since their land was substantially covered with large pine trees, the brothers built a turpentine still which they ran for about 20 years. They also built a large store where they carried on an extensive mercantile business for an even longer time. During those early years the community was known as \\"Puddin' Swamp\\". In 2016, the town gained notoriety for a civil suit brought against it. The suit alleges that the town's \\"town safety\\" ordinances, which allows Turbeville to write traffic tickets with higher fines than state traffic tickets and keep the money from the citations, are illegal and should be repealed. The town reportedly has nearly twice the ticket rate of much larger nearby towns, writing nearly 2,500 per year, most of which come during prime beach season, as the town is on the major routes between Columbia and Myrtle Beach.\\"SC‚Äôs ‚Äòspeed trap:‚Äô Turbeville committing highway robbery, suit alleges.\\" The State, Columbia, South Carolina, June 25, 2016.

Edisto Beach's population was 414 as of the 2010 census, down from 641 in 2000. The town limits include only the developed coastal area of Edisto Island within Colleton County, while the majority of the island consists of unincorporated land in Charleston County. Due to its status as a bedroom community, Edisto Beach is among the most affluent communities in the state. History Edisto Beach was originally settled by the Edistow Indians, but was rediscovered by the Spanish in the late 16th century. Thereafter, commerce on the island began to develop. Rice and indigo were the most common crops during the early settlement years. Later, significant cotton plantations were built and flourished. This industry, fueled by rich land owners and slaves, prospered until the Civil War. Although Union soldiers invaded Edisto and Johns Island, Confederate forces were able to retain control of Charleston until 1865, very late in the war. Initial development was begun in the early 20th century and planned by the island's owner, John McConkey. However, development stalled when he was murdered. By the 1920s, South Carolina residents began arriving on Edisto Island and Edisto Beach to build crude retreats. In those days, access to the island could be gained only at low tide by driving or riding across the marsh on beds of oyster shells. Although most homes on the island were destroyed in the 1940s, Hurricane Hugo spared the island in 1989. It has since become a vacation destination, with a section of the island purchased by Wyndham Resorts in 2006 from Fairfield that included a restaurant and golf course.History of Edisto About Edisto Beach In 2012, Edisto held its first ever road race, attracting close to 200 runners, including the mayor.1st Annual Edisto Beach Road Race - March 17, 2012 - Race Results Edisto is known for its low tourism and its industrial scarcity.

Darlington is known for its Darlington Oak and Spanish moss.Darlington County, A Pictoral History, The Donning Co., 1986. Darlington is home to the famous Darlington Raceway, which hosts the annual NASCAR Southern 500 race. It is also the site of the National Motorsports Press Association (NMPA) Hall of Fame. Darlington is also a center for tobacco farming. Darlington is located 10 miles northwest of Florence and 76 miles northeast of the state capital, Columbia. History=Early history Darlington's origins date back to the mid-18th century. Originally a heavily wooded area, the settlement of what is now Darlington County began in earnest after 1736 and 1737 when the province of South Carolina set aside a vast area of land for the Welsh Baptists of Delaware. This Welsh Tract bordered both sides of the Pee Dee River. For almost thirty years, settlers concentrated on the banks and small tributaries of the Pee Dee River. Beginning in the 1760s, and continuing into the 1770s, other groups slowly made their way into present-day Darlington, and were granted lands on the Lynches River, Jeffries Creek, and a host of other watercourses. These settlers included descendants of French Huguenots, Scots- Irish, and the English. For 30 years following the arrival of the first settlers, local government did not exist for the citizens of the area. All deeds, estate settlements, and other legal matters had to be taken to Charles Town to be recorded. In 1769, by an Act of the Assembly, Cheraw District was established as a Judicial District. A courthouse and gaol (jail) were built at Long Bluff (near present-day Society Hill), and were operational by late 1772. After the Revolutionary War, in 1785, Cheraw District was divided into three counties, Marlborough, Chesterfield, and Darlington. Darlington County was bounded by the Pee Dee River), Lynches River, and Cedar Creek. To this day it is unknown why the county was named \\"Darlington\\", although it could be named after the North-Eastern town by the same name in Durham, England. After 1798 the designation \\"county\\" was changed to \\"district\\". In 1835, the city of Darlington became the new county seat. In the 1868 South Carolina Constitution, the designation reverted to \\"county\\". Florence County was created out of parts of Darlington and Marion counties in 1888. Darlington County gave up additional territory in 1902 when Lee County was created.This history was copied out of Darlington District, S.C. Cemetery Survey Volume One, compiled by members of the Old Darlington District Chapter of the South Carolina Genealogical Society. Copyright 1993. Darlington Court House and Public Square Darlington was originally built around the public square and the courthouse. Both now sit in their present location because of an argument between two men, Colonel Lamuel Benton and Captain Elias Dubose, in the late 18th century. The tale goes that the disagreement began over whether the courthouse should be located in Mechanicsville or Cuffey Town. It was said that the two compromised, each beginning in their town traveling on horseback until reaching one another. The spot where they met is now the site of the Darlington public square and courthouse. A fire in March 1806 destroyed the original courthouse. It was rumored at the time that an old woman was responsible for the flames in an attempt to burn papers connected to her coming court case. Between 1824 and 1825 it was rebuilt with brick due to a petition to build all buildings on the public square in brick to prevent the spread of fire. In 1835, the courthouse was chartered.

Williamson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early churches In the 1820s, denominations, mostly the Baptists, met at the courthouse. The Presbyterians built the first church. With the help of donations from all denominations, the church was built with the understanding that all denominations could have access to the building. The Baptists built their church in 1831, which had been planned since 1829. The Methodists built the third church in 1834, where the Methodist Cemetery is now located. The present-day Trinity United Methodist Church sanctuary was constructed in 1901. New Providence Baptist Church is the oldest Baptist church in the city of Darlington. The Civil War No battles during the Civil War occurred in Darlington. One of Sherman's lieutenants, a former architect, was sent to burn down part of Darlington. When he arrived and saw a house that he had designed, he left the house and the rest of the town standing. The federal troops burned down the depot, cotton platforms and railroad trestles in 1865. During this time, St. John's Academy was used as a hospital. Federal troops also did some foraging. In 1865, Confederate troops returned through Darlington and hanged a former slave named Amy Spain on the Public Square for insurrection. After the war, the town was occupied by federal troops, which were not withdrawn until 1871. By 1865, Darlington was the headquarters for the Third Separate Brigade of the Military District of Eastern South Carolina and the Freedmen's Bureau. In 1866, during the occupation, the worst fire to ever hit Darlington burned down the court house and the jail. It was rumored that drunken federal soldiers were to blame. The Darlington Guards Prior to the Civil War, as the South readied itself for secession, Darlington formed the Darlington Guards. When South Carolina seceded, they were the first called upon to defend Charleston. After their term of enlistment was over, the men returned to Darlington to reenlist in regiments going to Virginia. The Darlington Guards existed at this time for almost two years. They reorganized in later years and received their own armory in 1893. They were the first in the state to volunteer for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in May 1898. They were also seen by President William McKinley in Savannah, Georgia, before being sent to Cuba for occupation duties near Havana. After coming home, they continued to serve in the National Guard. In 1915 the group retired from service again, only to be reinstated and sent to the Mexican border in 1916. After returning home, they served in World War I. The last surviving member, Thomas W. Buchanan, died in 1984. Geography Darlington is located southeast of the center of Darlington County at (34.301370, -79.868659). U.S. Routes 52 and 401 bypass the city on the southwest.

Hartsville is home to several major corporations including Sonoco Products Company, Duke Energy's H. B. Robinson Nuclear Generating Station, Novolex, and Stingray Boats. History The area surrounding Hartsville was once home to several Native American tribes, including the Pee Dee, Catawba, Chicora, Edisto, Sane, and Chicora-Waccamaw, who inhabited the region until European settlers arrived. Hartsville's first settlement began around 1760. The town is named for Captain Thomas E. Hart, who eventually owned most of the land in the community. Hart started a successful mercantile business, but lost his business and his land during the economic depression of 1837‚Äì1838. In 1845, Thomas Hart's son, John Lide Hart, purchased of land in what is now downtown Hartsville from Colonel Law. John Hart went on to establish a carriage factory, steam-powered saw mill, grist mill, general store, and Hartsville Baptist Church. Caleb Coker purchased the carriage factory for his son James Lide Coker in 1855. James Lide Coker came to Hartsville in 1857 with plans to implement new farming methods he had learned at Harvard College. This was interrupted by the start of the Civil War, in which he became a major for the Confederacy. He returned to Hartsville injured and found that his plantation was in shambles. He planned to reconstruct his plantation and bring prosperity to the town of Hartsville. Major Coker established Welsh Neck High School, which later became Coker College. He also established a seed company, oil mill, fertilizer plant, the Coker and Company General Store, a bank, and the Southern Novelty Company, now known as Sonoco Products Company. Even with his own successes in business, Coker and his family were unable to convince other business owners in the area to build a railroad spur, so they decided to build their own, which became the Hartsville Railroad, completed in 1889. The Town of Hartsville received its first charter on December 11, 1891, during a period of bustling economic activity and growth. The railroad eventually became part of the South Carolina Central Railroad, and the Southern Novelty Company and Carolina Fiber Company merged to form Sonoco Products Company. Sonoco eventually expanded to a global scale and became a Fortune 500 company. Historic sites Locations listed on the National Register of Historic Places: * The Arcade Hotel * E.W.

History On March 3, 1970 \\"Survivors of 1970 racist attack on SC school bus honored\\", by Shamira McCray, Florence (SC) Morning News, May 4, 2019 during a rally opposing busing of pupils for the promotion of school desegregation, militants in Lamar, armed with baseball bats and ax handles, tipped over two buses in defiance of a court order. No one was seriously injured, but police used tear gas to restore order. The incident became an issue in the 1970 gubernatorial election between Republican then-U.S. Representative Albert Watson and his successful Democratic opponent, then-Lieutenant Governor John C. West. Prior to the violence, Watson had told a \\"freedom-of-choice\\" rally in Lamar that the parents should \\"ignore those who call you racists, bigots, and hard-core rednecks.\\" Watson adopted the slogan \\"Your Kind of Man\\"; West had warned that \\"no reasonable alternative [to desegregation] was feasible.\\" Some believe the incident in Lamar contributed to West's victory in the November general election.Billy Hathorn, \\"The Changing Politics of Race: Congressman Albert William Watson and the South Carolina Republican Party, 1965-1970\\", South Carolina Historical Magazine Vol. 89 (October 1988), p. 232-233 Geography Lamar is located in southwestern Darlington County at (34.170388, -80.062526).

The population was 4,750 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Edgefield County. Edgefield is part of the Augusta, Georgia metropolitan area. Geography Edgefield is located slightly east of the center of Edgefield County at (33.7868, ‚àí81.9278). U.S. Route 25 passes through the southwest part of the town, bypassing the center, and leads north to Greenwood and south to Augusta, Georgia. South Carolina Highway 23 passes through the center of the town, leading east to Batesburg-Leesville and west to Modoc on U.S. Route 221 near the Savannah River. According to the United States Census Bureau, Edgefield has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.71%, is water. History The story of Edgefield is more than a quarter of a millennium long, reaching back to before the first European settlers arrived, when only Native Americans roamed the forests. At that time the area which later became Edgefield County was a vast wilderness of virgin forests, occasional prairies, great cane brakes, and sparkling rivers and creeks. It was bisected by the fall line, with sandy soils on the southeast side of this line growing primarily pine trees, and rich clay soils on the northwest side growing primarily oak and hickory. Wildlife was abundant with deer and turkey, but also with elk, buffalo (bison), panther, and bear. 18th century The initial settlement of present-day Edgefield County occurred in the quarter century between 1750 and 1775. Some settlers came up from the South Carolina Lowcountry but more poured down \\"the Great Wagon Road\\" from the colonies to the north. In this colonial period the economy was primarily a subsistence one, in which the settlers consumed what they raised. Initially there were no courts or law enforcement, but beginning in the mid-1760s, the law-abiding settlers began their struggle to bring law, order, and government to the \\"backcountry\\" of South Carolina. The colonial period was followed by the prolonged conflict with Great Britain which began in 1775. By this time there were many settlers living in present-day Edgefield County and almost all of them were involved, on one side or the other, in the Revolutionary War. Some Edgefieldians were die-hard patriots from the outset, who believed that the American colonies should be free and independent. Others were loyal to the king who had granted them land and provided a home for them in the New World. Still others wanted no part of the conflict but were inevitably drawn into it by partisans on each side. Finally, others were strictly opportunists who switched sides back and forth as they perceived their best interest. The conflict was, in this area, a bitter civil war in which personal vendettas often superseded politics as the cause for fighting. Cousins fought against cousins and neighbors against neighbors. When General Lighthorse Harry Lee later wrote about the Revolution in this area, he stated that \\"in no part of the South was the war fought with such asperity as in this quarter. It often sank into barbarity.\\" Following the Revolution, citizens turned their attention to establishing local government and to rebuilding the economy. In 1785 the 96 District was divided into smaller counties. The boundaries of Edgefield County were established at that time and the courthouse site was designated. Although a substantial but unsuccessful effort was made in the late 1780s to bring tobacco to Edgefield County as a money crop, short staple cotton began to assume that role in the late 1790s. For the next two decades the cultivation of cotton spread like wildfire across the county. The rich clay soils of the piedmont proved ideal for growing cotton. African slaves were brought in to provide the labor for cotton cultivation, resulting in a mushrooming of the slave population of Edgefield County. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Edgefield County, like most of piedmont South Carolina, began to experience unprecedented prosperity. 19th century (antebellum period) With the construction of the jail and courthouse at the designated county seat beginning in 1785, a village began to grow up around the public buildings: first houses for the public officials, then a tavern, then a store, gradually other houses, and then other stores. By 1811 a school was established, then several churches and more houses. By 1826 South Carolina architect Robert Mills could describe Edgefield Courthouse village as \\"a neat little village ... [with] between forty and fifty [houses]. The buildings are neat, commodious, and generally painted . ... The population is estimated at 300.\\" In the antebellum era, Edgefield was not the market town of the District. In the Plantation economy, the plantation owners took their cotton to market in Augusta or Hamburg and bought the majority of their supplies from merchants in those market towns. The merchants of Edgefield Courthouse village primarily filled in the needs of the planters between trips to the larger market towns. During the first several decades of the 19th century, Edgefield, being the courthouse village of a large and prosperous district, began to develop its reputation as a center of law and politics. A number of the sons of the wealthy cotton planters and other ambitious young men, after attending elite schools and colleges across the nation, came to Edgefield to practice law and engage in politics. Many of these young lawyers and politicians also maintained large plantations out in the District. These budding leaders built substantial houses in town and created a social atmosphere which attracted more similarly-situated young men. The social prestige of being a planter with broad acres and many slaves, and dabbling in law and politics, caused many ambitious young Edgefieldians in the antebellum period to develop a self- confidence, an overdeveloped sense of honor, and an aristocratic worldview which did not always serve them well. One result of this was a widespread devotion to the Code Duello, which resulted in a number of Edgefield's best and brightest becoming involved in tragic duels. Another result was a sense of invincibility, which caused many to approach war with a cavalier attitude and to focus on the glories of victory rather than on the horrors of death and defeat. These young men also accepted violence, which had been a common occurrence in Edgefield from its earliest days, as an inevitable part of life, and in some cases even glorified it. Edgefield had a \\"violent reputation\\". \\"Since before Edgefield was officially a town, it has been known for violence and scandal.\\" While planting, politics, and violence captured the imagination of most white Edgefieldians, a number of other bright young men looked for opportunities in industry and commerce. Dr. Abner Landrum developed a pottery industry which was to have a major impact on Edgefield for more than half a century. Henry Schultz, a German immigrant, developed Hamburg, a new town on the Savannah River, which became an important commercial center during the antebellum era. Another German immigrant, Christian Breithaupt, built the first textile mill in this part of the state at Vaucluse. A number of Edgefieldians participated in bringing the South Carolina Railroad to Hamburg. The Plank Road from Edgefield to Hamburg was built. William Gregg, a Charleston silversmith, came to run the Vaucluse factory and wound up developing the Graniteville factory, the most successful textile operation in the antebellum South. These industrial and commercial enterprises were a significant part of the fabric of antebellum Edgefield and a number of the Edgefield lawyers and planters were involved in these endeavors. However, the most significant contribution of antebellum Edgefield to our nation's history was the intense sectionalism which began in the mid-1820s and evolved to 1860. Edgefield Congressman George McDuffie (later Senator and Governor) initiated the fight against federal tariffs which were imposed on imported goods to protect New England manufacturers. He believed that the interests of this section of the country were being sacrificed for the good of New England. McDuffie, together with South Carolina statesman John C. Calhoun, developed the doctrine of \\"nullification\\", which postulated that a state had the right to nullify a federal law with which it disagreed. This doctrine was put to a test in 1832. South Carolina passed the Ordinance of Nullification, and President Andrew Jackson threatened to send troops to the state to enforce the tariff. Edgefieldians, like most South Carolinians, reacted violently to the President's threats. Militia units were called up and the state braced for war. A national crisis was averted only by a last minute compromise that gradually reduced the tariffs. Later, as the anti-slavery movement gained momentum and began to threaten the economic basis of the South's prosperity, most white Edgefieldians, like most white South Carolinians, embraced this sectionalism. National unity was again threatened in 1850 when many leaders throughout the South began to speak of secession. The 1856 caning of Senator Charles Sumner by Edgefield Congressman Preston Brooks on the floor of the United States Senate galvanized the nation and set South Carolina on a course for secession and Civil War. By the fall of 1860 when Abraham Lincoln was elected President, all but a few Edgefield citizens were convinced that the time had come for the South to go its own way. A convention was called and Edgefield's delegation joined in the unanimous declaration of secession. Civil War and Reconstruction At the outbreak of war in April 1861, the vast majority of Edgefieldians welcomed the conflict, believing that they would defeat the North in short order and the risk of slavery being outlawed would be eliminated. Hundreds of Edgefieldians volunteered for service and were quickly sent to Virginia to take on the federal forces. Little did they realize the sacrifices which they would make during the ensuing four years. Before the war was over almost every Edgefield male between the ages of 15 and 60 had been involved in some way in the war effort. Although the war never got closer than Aiken (Edgefieldians have always claimed that Sherman was afraid to come to Edgefield!), the people of Edgefield endured four bloody years in which nearly one-third of their fighting age white males became casualties. The incalculable devastation of the war is hard to comprehend. Almost all the liquid assets of the citizens had been invested in Confederate currency or bonds which were now worthless. The emancipation of the slaves wiped out a huge portion of the county's wealth, and giving them the right to vote brought an almost total reorganization of the political, economic, and social systems. During the eleven-year period of Reconstruction, the newly freed slaves, called \\"freedmen\\", became sharecroppers, farming the land on shares with the landowners. They also acquired the right to vote and hold office. Together with \\"carpetbaggers\\" (Northerners who had come South seeking opportunities) and \\"scalawags\\" (Southern anti-slavery whites who had joined the Republican Party), the white population lost their control of local and state government. Intimidated by the occupying Federal troops, the white population were militarily and politically dominated by what they perceived as corrupt Republican administrations imposed upon them by force by their Northern enemies. The Red Shirt Campaign of 1876, largely orchestrated by the former Confederate generals Martin W. Gary and M. C. Butler of Edgefield, was a massive organized effort on the part of the white population to regain control of the political machinery of the state. Violence was a calculated part of the strategy to remove Republican dominance. The Freedmen and their Republican allies tried valiantly to maintain their political control in the face of the fierce campaign by the former Confederates. By the middle of 1877 the Red Shirt strategy, along with an increasing willingness on the part of the rest of the nation to allow the South to go forward on its own terms, proved successful in bringing the control of the state back into the hands of the white population. In the ensuing decades the black population of Edgefield, like that of the entire South, was thrust back into second-class citizenship by the persistent efforts of the whites who were determined to see that the conditions of Reconstruction were never allowed to return. Later 19th century One of the principal results of the breakdown of the antebellum plantation system was that goods were no longer purchased centrally by the planters and then parceled out during the year, but rather freedmen and other small farmers purchased their own goods as they saw fit. This, together with the proliferation of manufactured consumer goods in the late 19th century, led to the development of a vigorous commercial economy in which every town and every crossroads sprouted new merchants. These new merchants, who often used questionable practices to benefit themselves at the expense of their customers, enjoyed a long period of prosperity. During this period the village of Edgefield suffered a series of fires which destroyed practically all of the commercial area of the town except for the courthouse. In 1881 and 1884 the entire eastern and northern portions of the town were laid waste in devastating fires. In 1892 the southern and western sides of the Public Square were burned. A town ordinance was passed in 1884 requiring that all new buildings constructed within 500 feet of the town square be built of brick. It was from the ashes of these tragic fires that most of the current buildings of the town were raised. Prosperous merchants and other town leaders built new stores and, in many cases, they built grandly. The commercial district around the public square and down Main Street began to take shape. The continuing development of railroads, such as the Charlotte, Columbia, and Augusta Railroad, built through the eastern part of the county in the late 1860s and the Augusta and Greenwood Railroad built through the western part of the county in the 1880s, resulted in the development of numerous railroad depot towns, including Ridge Spring, Ward, Johnston, Trenton, Clark's Hill, Modoc, Parksville, Plum Branch and McCormick. These new towns took on a prosperity of their own and began to sap commercial activity which might otherwise have come to Edgefield. During this same period, the movement to bring government closer to the people resulted in the creation of a number of new counties, four of which took substantial portions of Edgefield. Aiken County was created in 1871; Saluda in 1895; Greenwood in 1897; and McCormick in 1916. Edgefield County, the area serviced by the Courthouse Village, was reduced in size to just over a quarter of what it had been. The county's agricultural economy began to suffer in the 1880s. The combination of a dramatic increase in the production of cotton, the continued depletion of the rich soils of the piedmont regions of the county, and other general economic ills which were also affecting farmers throughout the nation, made farming increasingly difficult. One Edgefield farmer decided to do something about these problems. Benjamin Ryan Tillman, believing that the state's political leaders were not doing enough to help the farmers, instigated the farmers‚Äô revolt, got himself elected Governor in 1890, and turned out of office the old guard of the state, including the principal leaders of the 1876 Red Shirt Campaign. 20th century In the thirty-odd year period from the late 1880s through the early 1920s a number of positive developments took place in Edgefield. The railroad finally reached Edgefield, the first telephone was installed, the Edgefield Mill was constructed, the first automobile came to town, electrical power was installed, water and sewer systems were built, a new hotel was constructed, and the streets around the town square were paved. As World War I proceeded, cotton prices shot up and a general prosperity prevailed. The town's population had exploded, going from approximately 500 in 1880 to 2,500 by 1920. Edgefield, it seemed, was finally getting back on its economic feet. Unfortunately, beginning in 1921 and 1922, the boll weevil, which had come from Central America and had been marching across the South since the turn of the century, finally arrived in Edgefield County, devastating the cotton crop on which the economy was almost entirely based. Farmers saw their production of cotton plummet by as much as 90 percent. Lands which had been devoted to cotton for more than a century were allowed to go idle. Sharecroppers, no longer able to make a living, left the farms and many left the state. Throughout the 1920s farm incomes sank; merchants, unable to collect accounts from destitute farmers, were squeezed; banks failed. Then, when it seemed as if economic conditions could not get worse, the 1929 market crash and the Great Depression further impoverished the county. The population of Edgefield County began to decline and continued to decline in every census from 1920 to 1970. World War II brought changes of other kinds. Young men throughout the county entered the service. A number of Edgefield families contributed multiple sons to the war effort. Former State Senator and Circuit Judge Strom Thurmond, West Side native J. L. Doolittle, Trenton native Fritz Huiet and Johnston native Robert Herlong all participated in the Normandy invasion. Women back home took on jobs which had traditionally been held by men. Rationing significantly affected everyone who remained in town. After the war, the soldiers returning brought back with them a new confidence and an ambition to improve the county. A well-organized effort to bring new industry to Edgefield enjoyed moderate success as the Crest Manufacturing Company was brought to town in the late 1940s. The neighboring town of Johnston was more successful as it secured both the Milliken and Riegel plants during the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s Edgefield added to its list of new industrial recruits the National Cabinet Company, Star Fibers, Federal Pacific Electric, and Tranter, each bringing a substantial number of new jobs. During this same period, farmers on the eastern side of the county began to expand their production of peaches which, by the 1960s, had become nationally significant. African-American soldiers had also fought valiantly in World War II, and when they returned, they came with a determination to improve their status in American society. A sustained campaign for Civil Rights developed at a national level in the late 1940s. The primary focus of this campaign was to overturn the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine, legitimized by the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision of the United States Supreme Court. In 1954 the court, in its unanimous Brown v. Board of Education decision, reversed the earlier decision and ruled that segregated facilities, even if equal, were unconstitutional. The late 1960s and the early 1970s brought other new developments to Edgefield: a new water line capable of supplying the county for decades to come, a new country club, a new private school, a new county hospital, the National Wild Turkey Federation headquarters, and a new congressman, Butler C. Derrick, Jr. Edgefield has rich clay deposits which provide the source for alkaline-glazed stoneware pottery which was developed by Dr. Abner Landrum in the early 19th century. The slave potter David Drake, who produced many large storage jars in the period between 1830 and 1870, was literate, signed his work, and became more widely known as popular artists a century after his death. Unsigned pottery from kilns in Pottersville and Edgefield today are known by the names of their owners; the artists were largely undocumented. The upland area also was developed for cotton plantations, after invention of the cotton gin made growing short-staple cotton profitable. Several mansions and a plantation have been preserved from this era: Blocker House, Cedar Grove, Darby Plantation, and together with the Edgefield Historic District, Horn Creek Baptist Church, and Pottersville, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 21st century On February 14, 2014, at 10:23pm, Edgefield had a 4.1 magnitude earthquake, followed by an aftershock of 3.2 on February 16, 2014, at 3:23pm.

The population was 3,550 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Fairfield County. Winnsboro is part of the Columbia, South Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Based on archeological evidence, this area of the Piedmont was occupied by various cultures of indigenous peoples from as early as the Archaic period, about 1500 BC. Blair Mound is a nearby archeological site and earthwork likely occupied 1300-1400 AD, as part of the late Mississippian culture in the region. Several years before the Revolutionary War, Richard Winn from Virginia moved to what is now Fairfield County in the upland or Piedmont area of South Carolina. His lands included the present site of Winnsboro. As early as 1777, the settlement was known as \\"Winnsborough\\" since he was the major landowner. His brothers John and Minor Winn joined him there, adding to family founders. The village was laid out and chartered in 1785 upon petition of Richard and John Winn, and John Vanderhorst. The brothers Richard, John and Minor Winn all served in the Revolutionary War. Richard became a general, and was said to have fought in more battles than any Whig in South Carolina. John gained the rank of colonel. See Fairfield County, South Carolina, for more. The area was developed for the cultivation of short-staple cotton after Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in 1793, which made processing of this type of cotton profitable. Previously it was considered too labor-intensive. Short-staple cotton was widely cultivated on plantations in upland areas throughout the Deep South, through an interior area that became known as the Black Belt. The increased demand for slave labor resulted in the forced migration of more than one million African-American slaves into the area through sales in the domestic slave market. By the time of the Civil War, the county's population was majority black and majority slave. Textile mills were constructed in the area beginning in the late 19th century, and originally only whites were allowed to work in the mills. \\"Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues\\", an industrial folk song of the 1930s with lyrics typical of the blues, refers to working in a cotton mill in this city. The song arose after the textile mill had been converted to a tire manufacturing plant, reflecting the widespread expansion of the auto industry. The song has been sung by Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, and other artists. It was the basis of one of the ballads by modernist composer/pianist Frederic Rzewski in his Four North American Ballads for solo piano, completed in 1979. Kathryn Woodard, \\"The Pianist's Body at Work: Mediating Sound and Meaning in Frederic Rzewski's Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues\\", Sonic Meditations, 2008, at Academia website, accessed 13 November 2014 Places listed on the National Register of Historic Places for Winnsboro range from an Archaic period archeological site, to structures and districts spanning the European- American/African-American history of the city, as in the following list: Albion, Balwearie, Blair Mound, Dr. Walter Brice House and Office, Concord Presbyterian Church, Furman Institution Faculty Residence, Hunstanton, Ketchin Building, Bob Lemmon House, Liberty Universalist Church and Feasterville Academy Historic District, McMeekin Rock Shelter, Mount Olivet Presbyterian Church, New Hope A.R.P.

Though not listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Winnsboro Town Clock built in 1837 is the oldest continuously running clock in the United States. In the late 19th century, after white Democrats regained control of state legislatures in the South, they passed Jim Crow laws establishing racial segregation of public facilities and disenfranchising blacks, excluding them from the political system. In 1960 in the United States Supreme Court decision of Boynton v. Virginia, the court ruled that racial segregation was unconstitutional in interstate bus stations, restaurants, bathrooms and on buses, as these were covered by constitutional protections of free interstate commerce. The Civil Rights Movement had begun to use public demonstrations and events to build public awareness. In 1961, CORE decided to test the bus ruling by sending mixed racial groups of Freedom Riders to ride interstate buses and use facilities in the segregated southern United States to challenge practices related to segregation of buses and bus stations. They intended to travel through the Deep South and end at New Orleans. They were met by increasing violence as they went south. Winnsboro was one of the cities where some Freedom Riders were beaten by local whites and arrested by local officials. One was rescued by a local African-American man while outrunning a white mob.

The population was 1,480 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Florence Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city was founded in 1913 west of the spot of the former Witherspoon's Ferry on the Pee Dee River, where General Francis Marion received his commission for the Revolutionary War. Edward \\"Dwight\\" Carraway, Jr. (1956-2019), a resident of Johnsonville, holds the record of South Carolina's youngest person elected to public office in June 1976. Also, he was a classmate of Joseph Stevens \\"Steve\\" Dukes who has served as mayor of Johnsonville since 2004. History Statue of General Francis Marion at Venters LandingIn use during the American Revolution, Witherspoon's Ferry was the site where Francis Marion accepted command of the Williamsburg Militia in 1780. Ownership of the ferry lands passed from Robert to John Witherspoon in 1787. In 1802, John bequeathed the land to Aimwell Presbyterian Church. Witherspoon's Ferry was a strategic ferry in the northeastern area of Williamsburg County, vested in John Witherspoon in 1801 and remaining in his charge until his death in 1815. According to the terms of John Witherspoon's will, the ferry was vested in J.D. Witherspoon, executor, for a term of 14 years, \\"in trust for and having the sole benefit of the incorporated Presbyterian Church at Aimwell on the Pee Dee River.\\" In 1819, former South Carolina Governor David R. Williams, son-in-law of John Witherspoon, obtained these ferry lands. William J. Johnson, born 1787, succeeded J.D. Witherspoon at the ferry after purchasing the plantation in 1825 from the Witherspoon estate. The 1850 census of Williamsburg County shows William Johnson, a man of considerable wealth for his time and place, living just below where the American Legion stands in Johnsonville today. Johnson's Ferry was a stagecoach horse changeover and meal break station. As the stagecoach passed east over the Lynches River on the ferry, a Johnson slave in charge of the ferry mules announced the number of passengers with a blast from a fox horn: one blast for each passenger, thus informing Mrs. Johnson of the number of places that should be set for dinner. The stagecoach stopped at the Johnsons' house. All the mail for the surrounding communities was left in Capt. Johnson's care. This provided an excellent reason for him to request a post office be granted. In 1843, a post office named Johnsonville was established near the ferry. The city of Johnsonville was incorporated in 1913.http://www.johnsonvilleschistory.org Geography Broadway St. Looking East, 2015Johnsonville is located in southeastern Florence County at (33.817802, -79.448288).

It was first called \\"Graham's Crossroads\\" and then \\"Graham\\", after Aaron Graham, a land owner around the crossroads that now form Church and Main streets in Lake City. In 1856, the Northeastern Railroad built its main line through the area. This brought new growth to the community. On March 4, 1874, after requests from residents, a city charter was granted to the new town of Graham. On December 24, 1883, the town changed its name to \\"Lake City\\", after the swimming lakes just north of town. This was at the request of the locally- serving Lynches Lake Post Office, since there was another post office in South Carolina known as that. This small town had a population of 300 in 1893, and by 1898 the area had become the leading strawberry cropland in South Carolina. Lake City was the site of a notorious lynching on February 22, 1898, that resulted in the mob murders of the city's black postmaster and his infant daughter.\\"The Lake City Lynching: Thirteen Men Indicted in a Federal Court for the Alleged Murder of a Negro Postmaster\\", New York Times, April 8, 1899.David C.

History Southern live oaks overarching the streets, such as these on East Bay Street. Pre-Revolution In 1526 a Spanish expedition under Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n founded a colony on Waccamaw Neck called San Miguel de Guadalupe. The settlers included enslaved Africans, and was the first European settlement in North America with African slaves. The colony failed for multiple reasons including a fever epidemic and a revolt of the slaves, who escaped to join the indigenous Cofitachequi Indians in the area. Having failed as farmers, the surviving Spanish built a ship from local cypress and oak trees and sailed to the Spice Islands in Maritime Southeast Asia. The next settlement in the area was by English colonists. After settling Charles Town in 1670, the English established trade with regional Indian tribes. Trading posts in the outlying areas quickly developed as settlements. By 1721 the colonial government granted the English residents' petition to found a new parish, Prince George, Winyah, on the Black River. In 1734, Prince George, Winyah was divided; and the newly created Prince Frederick Parish congregation occupied the church at Black River. Prince George Parish, Winyah encompassed the new town of Georgetown that was developing on the Sampit River. In 1729, Elisha Screven laid the plan for Georgetown and developed the city in a four-by-eight block grid. The original grid city is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. It bears the original street names, lot numbers, and has many original homes. The Indian trade declined soon after Georgetown was established. Planters established large plantations and cultivated indigo as the cash commodity crop, with rice as a secondary crop. Both were labor-intensive and dependent on slave labor, primarily workers imported from Africa in the Atlantic slave trade.Note: Indigo production in British India soon eclipsed the production of indigo in the Carolinas, and rice took its place as the chief commodity crop. Agricultural profits were so great between 1735 and 1775 that in 1757 the Winyah Indigo Society, whose members paid dues in indigo, opened and maintained the first public school for white children between Charles Town and Wilmington. Rice became the chief commodity crop by the early 19th century, and a staple of regional diets as well. In the American Revolution, the father and son Georgetown planters, Thomas Lynch Sr. and Thomas Lynch Jr., signed the Declaration of Independence. During the final years of the conflict, Georgetown was the important port for supplying General Nathanael Greene's army. Francis Marion (the \\"Swamp Fox\\") led many guerrilla actions in the vicinity. Winyah Indigo Society Hall, Georgetown Antebellum period Crowley Store, Georgetown Following the American Revolution, rice surpassed indigo as the staple crop. It was cultivated in the swampy lowlands along the rivers, where enslaved labor built large earthworks: dams, gates and canals to irrigate and drain the rice fields during cultivation. Large rice plantations were established around Georgetown along its five rivers. Planters often had chosen to import slaves from rice-growing regions of West Africa, as they knew the technology for cultivation and processing. By 1840, the Georgetown District (later County) produced nearly one-half of the total rice crop of the United States. It became the largest rice-exporting port in the world. Wealth from the rice created an elite European-American planter class; they built stately plantation manor houses, bought elegant furniture, and extended generous hospitality to others of their class. Their relatively leisured lifestyle for a select few, built on the labor of thousands of slaves, lasted until 1860.The collapse of the rice economy was due to the abolition of slavery. The soft silt soil of the South Carolina low country required harvesting of the rice by hand. Slavery made the labor-intensive cultivation and harvesting profitable. The abolition of slavery and rise of free labor meant that the economics had changed. In addition, the disruption and destruction of the war delayed the resumption of agriculture. J.R. Smith House at 722 Prince Street. Also known as the Mark Moses, it served briefly as a Jewish school The profits from Georgetown's rice trade buoyed the economy also of nearby Charleston, where a thriving mercantile economy developed. The profits from rice meant that planters bought products from Charleston artisans: fine furniture, jewelry, and silver, to satisfy their refined tastes. Joshua John Ward, who owned the most slaves in the US - eventually more than 1,000 slaves on several plantations, lived in Georgetown. Many of the historic plantation houses are still standing today, including Mansfield Plantation on the banks of the Black River. Joshua Ward's main Brookgreen Plantation is the center and namesake of the Brookgreen Gardens park. Since the late 20th century, historic societies and independent plantations have worked to present more of the entire plantation world, including the lives and skills of enslaved African Americans. Georgetown's thriving economy long attracted settlers from elsewhere, including numerous planters and shipowners who migrated from Virginia. These included the Shackelford family, whose migrant ancestor John Shackelford moved to Georgetown in the eighteenth century after serving in the Virginia forces of the Continental Army. His descendants became prominent planters, lawyers, judges and Georgetown and Charleston businessmen.Yates Snowden, Harry Gardner Cutler, History of South Carolina, The Lewis Publishing Company, 1920 During the Civil War, a Confederate fort and two camps were installed near Georgetown by Murrells Inlet. Fort Ward was in service beginning in 1861 but was abandoned and disarmed in March 1862; its exact location is unknown due to shifting sandbars and erosion.Payette, Peter. \\"South Carolina Forts\\".

Reconstruction and post- reconstruction period Arcadia Plantation, circa 1893, Georgetown vicinity, Georgetown County Georgetown and Georgetown County suffered terribly during the Reconstruction Era because of its continued reliance on agriculture, for which the national market was low. In addition, the rice crops of 1866‚Äì88 were failures due to lack of capital, which prevented adequate preparation for new crops; inclement weather; and the planters' struggle to find laborers. Some freedmen left the area in an effort to reunite families separated by the domestic slave trade. Many families withdrew women and children from working as field laborers. Many freedmen families wanted to work for themselves as subsistence farmers, rather than work in gangs for major planters. Rice continued to be grown commercially until about 1910, but the market had changed. It was never as important economically or as profitable a crop as before 1860. By the time the Reconstruction period ended, the area's economy was shifting to harvesting and processing wood products. By 1900 several lumber mills were operating on the Sampit River. The largest was the Atlantic Coast Lumber Company; its mill in Georgetown was the largest lumber mill on the East Coast at the time. 20th century Around 1905, \\"Georgetown reached its peak as a lumber port\\", according to the historian Mac McAlister. As the twentieth century dawned, Georgetown under the leadership of Mayor William Doyle Morgan began to modernize. The city added electricity, telephone service, sewer facilities, rail connections, some paved streets and sidewalks, new banks, a thriving port, and a new public school for white students. Public schools were segregated and black schools were historically underfunded. The US government built a handsome combination post office and customs house. Like most cities, Georgetown suffered economic deprivation during the Great Depression. The Atlantic Coast Lumber Company went bankrupt early in the depression, putting almost everyone out of work. Businesses related to the mills also lost revenues and had to lay off employees, with a cascading effect through the city. In 1936 help arrived, when the Southern Kraft Division of International Paper opened a mill; by 1944 it was the largest in the world. From the mid-20th century, the city developed more industry. In 1973, the Korf company of Germany founded a steel mill in town. in 1993, the steel mill was financed by Bain Capital and was called Georgetown Steel, which became GST Steel Company with its sister Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1978, Sigma Chemical Company founded its third chemical plant (the other 2 being in Italy) in Georgetown. In September 1989, a major disaster struck the area with Hurricane Hugo struck south of Georgetown. Its extremely hard winds and an intense storm surge along the rivers flooded and damaged Georgetown and nearby areas. As Georgetown was under Hugo's northern eyewall, it suffered winds more severe and damaging than in Charleston, which was in the hurricane's weak corridor. 2000 to present In recent years, the economy has become more diversified. The GST Steel Company declared bankruptcy in 2001, first closing the Kansas City plant. In 2003 it closed the South Carolina plant. The Georgetown plant has subsequently reopened under ownership of ArcelorMittal. Due to the influx of cheap foreign steel into the United States, the plant closed its doors again in August 2015. On May 19, 2017, Mayor Jack Scoville announced that ArcelorMittal had agreed to sell the mill to Liberty Steel. On September 25, 2013, a fire engulfed seven historic buildings on 700 Block of Front Street. The fire raged for hours while over 200 firefighters from ten departments and the United States Coast Guard fought to contain the blaze. Heritage tourism has become a booming business in Georgetown, supporting much retail activity. In addition, many retirees have chosen to settle in this area of beaches, plantations redeveloped as residential communities, and pleasant climate. On January 18, 2018, long-time Democratic City Councilman Brendon Moses Barber, Sr. was inaugurated as Mayor of Georgetown; he is the first African-American mayor of the city. The City of Georgetown has always elected Democratic mayors, even as the make-up of the major parties has realigned since the late 20th century. As of 2019, brackish water incursions into the Waccamaw River near Georgetown due to rising sea levels are increasing the risk of exposure to toxic vibrio bacteria.

The population was 7,547 at the 2010 census. The community was once primarily a fishing village, but has grown substantially in modern time, along with the rest of the Grand Strand, into a tourist and retirement location. It is most known for the Murrells Inlet Marshwalk, a boardwalk overlooking a salt marsh and which houses many restaurants. Geography Murrells Inlet is located in northeastern Georgetown County at (33.551593, -79.048794). The northern edge of the CDP follows the Horry County line. U.S. Route 17 (Ocean Highway) runs through the center of the community, leading northeast to Myrtle Beach and southwest to Georgetown, the seat of Georgetown County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Murrells Inlet CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.21%, are water. It has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and average monthly temperatures range from 46.5¬∞ F in January to 80.5¬∞ F in July. The local hardiness zone is 8b. History The land around Murrells Inlet has a record of settlement that goes back thousands of years, before written history, but evident in the shell mounds and archeological findings from the Atlantic Ocean to the Waccamaw River. The early inhabitants included the Waccamaw people, who took advantage of the natural resources provided by the creeks and rivers. Wachesaw is loosely translated as \\"Place of Great Weeping\\", in reference to the burial grounds. Indian burial mounds have been found along the high bluffs at Wachesaw that contained European beads, urns and other artifacts. The recorded history of the area goes back to the days of English settlements and the land grants of the Lords Proprietors, when large portions of the Waccamaw Neck were divided into baronies that stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Waccamaw River. The baronies were typically tens of thousands of acres that were subdivided into long narrow plantations that ranged from . The plantations of Murrells Inlet included The Oaks, Brookgreen, Springfield, Laurel Hill, Richmond Hill, and Wachesaw (from south to north). The first land grants were given to Robert Daniell in 1711, who in turn sold to several other speculators, with the first planters arriving in the 1730s to begin building settlements. The most notable (for historic purposes) was Captain John Murrell, who bought which eventually became Wachesaw and Richmond Hill plantations, and built a house on the bluff there around 1733. He was a subsistence farmer, and raised indigo as the primary cash crop. He died in 1771 and left his land to his son Daniel and his two daughters, after which it became the two separate plantations. Wachesaw Plantation was eventually purchased by Allard Belin around 1800, while Richmond Hill passed through Murrell descendants until it was sold to an Allston (most likely John Hayes Allston, who pioneered rice planting techniques with clay). Adjacent plantations were owned by a host of famous planters, including Plowden Weston, his grandson Plowden C. J. Weston, William Allston, Benjamin Allston, Dr. Henry Flagg, Allard Flagg, Joshua Ward, Allard Belin and their descendants. These plantations prospered during the establishment of the rice culture of the 1700s and 1800s. These men were actively involved with supporting the American cause during the Revolutionary War, including William Allston who was a captain under and brother-in-law of Francis Marion (who had family ties through marriage to the Allston family). The Waccamaw Neck planters were represented in the state Senate and House, as well as the Governor's and Lieutenant Governor's office during the 1800s. The rice planters were also active in the establishment of social, educational, and religious organizations, including the Planters Club, the Winyah Indigo Society, the Hot and Hot Fish Club, the All Saints Academy, the Waccamaw Methodist Mission, and All Saints Waccamaw. The names of the families are shown on the various historic maps that date back as far as 1783 ‚Äì the listing of the Murrell family on the first maps is the most credible explanation of the origin of the name \\"Murrells Inlet\\". It has been alternately shown as \\"Morrall's Inlet\\" and \\"Murrays Inlet\\" on later maps. The rice plantation era came to an end after the Civil War with the emancipation of the slaves (rice cultivation was labor-intensive) and a series of hurricanes that climaxed with the 1893 Hurricane (also known as the Flagg flood, where the Atlantic Ocean was reported to meet the Waccamaw River). The loss of the slave labor resulted in the decline of the fields, dikes, and water control structures required for rice cultivation, since planters had to rely on freedmen to work the fields. Several powerful hurricanes following the Civil War and up to the 1893 hurricane resulted in uprooted trees and flood-damaged dikes in the rice fields and ultimately ended the production of rice on the Waccamaw Neck. The 1893 hurricane became known as the Flagg Flood, because the Flagg families that lived in houses on Magnolia Beach (Dr. Arthur, his wife Georgeanne, his son Arthur Jr., and his wife and six children) were swept away in the storm surge. Dr. Ward Flagg (one of three sons) survived the storm and retired to the miller's cottage in Brookgreen and reportedly never visited the ocean again. After Dr. Allard Flagg's death in 1901, his daughter sold Wachesaw and the Hermitage to Samuel Sidney Fraser, a real estate speculator, who bought and sold interests in several old plantations after the Civil War. Fraser held onto the plantation briefly before selling to Robert Ernest Beaty in 1905. Clarke A. Willcox of Marion purchased Wachesaw and the Hermitage in 1910 for $10,000 to use as a summer retreat. The Willcox family retained the Hermitage, but sold Wachesaw in 1930 to William A. Kimbel, who also bought Richmond Hill with the purpose of developing a large hunting estate. With his purchase of both properties, Kimbel had restored the boundaries of John Murrell's original plantation. In 1920, Dr. Julius A. Mood of Sumter and a group of sportsmen bought Brookgreen, Springfield, Laurel Hill, and The Oaks to use as a hunting preserve. His daughter, Julia Mood Peterkin, made several visits to Brookgreen and used the area as the setting for some of her novels. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for Scarlet Sister Mary in 1928. Club members enjoyed their hunting paradise for ten years, as a succession of owners conserved the property before selling out to yet another wealthy outsider seeking a rural estate in the South where land was cheap. After numerous owners, railroad magnate Archer Milton Huntington purchased Brookgreen in 1930. At first, he and his wife, Anna Hyatt Huntington, intended Brookgreen as a winter resort. Eventually, they decided to use the plantation as an outdoor gallery for Mrs. Huntington's award-winning sculptures. The Huntingtons constructed Atalaya, a Spanish-style fort, on the beach to use for her studio and living quarters at what is now Huntington Beach State Park, abandoning the plantation houses. The years from Reconstruction until World War I saw an increase in the number of settlers who moved to Murrells Inlet to enjoy the natural resources provided. The family names listed in the 1900‚Äì1930 census records reflect the growth and are still found in Murrells Inlet today. The families that moved into this area were from communities like Marion, Conway, Southport, and other nearby counties. The transportation corridors up to the 1900s were primarily the Waccamaw River and the Atlantic Ocean for boats, and the Kings Road (used during George Washington's visit) and the River Road (along the Waccamaw River near the plantation houses) for horse and wagons. These dirt paths were crude rough paths that bore no resemblance to today's modern highways. Highway 17 was paved around 1933 as part of a federal effort to provide paved roads across the United States. Early shipping routes relied on the deepwater access provided by the Waccamaw River to move vast quantities of materials and goods. The Comanche was an early steamship that called on Wachesaw Landing to deliver passengers and mail to Murrells Inlet.

Pawleys Island's population was 103 at the 2010 census, down from 138 in 2000. The post office address also includes an unincorporated area on the mainland adjacent to the island, which includes a commercial district along the Ocean Highway (US Route 17) and a residential area between the highway and the Waccamaw River. The island is on the southern end of The Grand Strand and is one of the oldest resort areas of the US East Coast. The town of Pawleys Island, though, is only on the island. The island lies off the Waccamaw Neck, a long, narrow peninsula between the ocean and the river, and is connected to the mainland by two bridges, the North Causeway and the South Causeway. History The earliest known inhabitants of the Pawleys Island area were Waccamaw and Winyah Native Americans. They called the area \\"Chiquola\\" or \\"Chicora\\", meaning \\"the land\\". The Waccamaw tribe got its name from the nearby Waccamaw river. The river is referred to by the natives as \\"coming and going\\" which influenced their name. These tribes lived off of the land and the sea. They embellished many amenities that it came with, including Oysters. The ocean winds and the abundant source of wildlife made it ideal for these tribes. Even today there is some evidence left such as \\"middens\\", these are huge piles of shells from the oysters that were harvested by these tribes. There are still a few Waccamaw natives left unlike their neighboring tribe, the Winyahs who are completely extinct. The Winyahs inherit their name from the Winyah Bay, an area known for its surplus of wildlife much like Pawleys Island. In the early 1700s the colonists from Europe began to set up markets and shops to barter and sell items with these tribes. This was short lived; soon fights began to break out and many problems arose causing complete destruction of these tribes. The island became a refuge from summer mosquitoes because of common windy conditions. The town's namesake George Pawley owned the island during the colonial era, and sold portions of it to other planters seeking to escape malaria. In 1791, two years after he was elected president, George Washington toured the Grand Strand, travelling The King's Highway in the unincorporated portion off Pawleys Island to visit the Alstons, wealthy planters who owned several plantations in the area. Rice fields occupied the Waccamaw River side of the neck. With Hurricane Hugo in 1989, some island cottages were swept away and have since been replaced. The island bans commercial or industrial buildings on the island with the exception of a '70s condominium complex and a few grandfathered inns, including the SeaView Inn and the PCJ Weston House, which is now the Pelican Inn. Pawleys Island, South Carolina Town Hall The town government was incorporated in 1985. The water temperature is comfortable from May to October, and there is abundant fishing, crabbing, shrimping, and birdwatching most months of the year.

The Gray Man ghost  The Gray Man is a famous purported ghost local to Pawleys Island and is said to have walked the coastline for nearly 200 years. His presence is said to warn of hurricanes and other dangers. The most common origin story of the Gray Man is that in 1822 a young woman was staying on the island with her family when she received word that her fianc√© was going to join her there. Delighted with the news, she prepared all of his favorite dishes in anticipation of his arrival. However as her fianc√© was traveling to the house he challenged his servants to a race on their horses. As they raced he saw a shortcut through a marsh and decided to take it. The horse stumbled in the marsh, throwing him off the horse, and despite his servants' efforts to free him he sank into the mud. The news of her fianc√©'s death nearly drove the girl mad, and she had distressing waking and night-dream visions of him. Her family took her to Charleston to see a doctor; within hours of their leaving a hurricane hit the coast and almost all of the Pawleys Island inhabitants died, but the family's house was untouched. Education Pawleys Island has a public library, a branch of the Georgetown County Library.

The population was 1,998 at the 2010 census. Geography Ninety Six is located in eastern Greenwood County at (34.173211, -82.021710). South Carolina Highway 34 passes through the town as its Main Street; it leads west to Greenwood, the county seat, and east to Newberry. Lake Greenwood State Park is northeast of town, and Ninety Six National Historic Site is south of the center of town. According to the United States Census Bureau, Ninety Six has a total area of , all land. Etymology There is much confusion about the name, \\"Ninety Six\\", and the true origin may never be known. Speculation has led to the mistaken belief that it was to the nearest Cherokee settlement of Keowee; to a counting of creeks crossing the main road leading from Lexington, South Carolina, to Ninety-Six; to an interpretation of a Welsh expression, nant-sych, meaning \\"dry gulch\\". No one is able to confirm that founder Robert Goudey (sic) was Welsh, English, Scottish, or German. An examination of early maps indicates markings such as \\"30\\" and \\"60\\" and \\"90\\" at different points, possibly indicating chains, a surveying measurement. Since Ninety-Six was located in Clarendon Parish, it is possible that parish linear measurements as used in England were used on colonial maps to measure distances in \\"chains\\". In England, according to a British and Welsh booklet designating linear measurements, parish maps used a rule of \\"4 chains to the inch\\". In using that parish rule on an early map of colonial South Carolina, 90 \\"chains\\" on a map would probably cover approximately , the map distance from \\"Saxe Gotha\\" (modern Lexington, South Carolina) to Ninety-Six. Using the same measurements for the distance from Ninety-Six to the Savannah River, the measurement would be approximately , or (very) roughly 6 \\"chains\\", hence 96. Even so, the origin of the name \\"Ninety-Six\\" remains a mystery. Ninety Six has been noted for its unusual place name. History Ninety Six was established on the frontier in the early 18th century. For a time it was known as \\"Jews Land\\" because some prominent Sephardic Jewish families of London bought extensive property there. The Salvador and DaCosta families bought , intending to help some poor Sephardic families relocate from London to the New World.They began to settle it.Pencak, Jews and Gentiles in Early America 1654‚Äì1800, p. 124. The settlement became the capital city of the Ninety-Six District when it was established in July 1769. Since the late 20th century, the National Park Service has operated the Ninety Six National Historic Site at the site of the original settlement and fort. Ninety Six figured prominently in the Anglo- Cherokee War (1758‚Äì1761). During the American Revolutionary War, it was a site for southern campaigns. The first land battle of the revolution south of New England was fought here 19‚Äì21 November 1775. On August 1, 1776, American militia forces led by Major Andrew Williamson were ambushed by Cherokee and Loyalists near here in the Battle of Twelve Mile Creek. More than 4,000 Cherokee had waged war on a long front beginning in June, from Tennessee to central South Carolina. Francis Salvador, a Sephardic Jewish immigrant from London and a planter, was one of the casualties. He was the first Jew to be killed fighting with the Patriots in the Revolutionary War. In 1780 the British fortified the strategically important frontier town with a star fort. From May 22 to June 18, 1781, Major General Nathanael Greene, with 1,000 Continental Army troops, besieged 550 American Loyalists who were defending Ninety Six. General Greene's chief engineer at the siege was the world- renowned Polish hero Colonel Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, who was wounded at the siege. The Loyalists survived the siege and relocated after the war to Rawdon, Nova Scotia, Canada, with support from the Crown for resettlement.

Southern Railway in Furman From 1899 until the 1980s, the Southern Railway operated a line through Furman and nearby Allendale, Tarboro, and Lena. Called the \\"Southern Columbia to Savannah Route\\", the rail also ran through Barnwell and Blackville to the north. Its primary purpose was to increase north/south passenger and freight traffic by feeding into the Atlantic Coast Line at Hardeeville for passage south to Florida or north to Charleston and other points. The rail line was built to compete with another north/south rail line operated nearby by the Seaboard Air Line (also called the Florida Central & Peninsular, Seaboard Coast Line, and presently CSX) which ran a different course through Denmark, Fairfax, Estill, and Garnett (parallel to US 321) and then into Georgia. Between 1963 and 1970, Southern abandoned its tracks between Furman and Hardeeville, leaving Furman as the ending station from Columbia. In the early 1980s, Southern abandoned its tracks south of Blackville, ending its rail service to Barnwell, Allendale, and Furman. However, by the 1970s, any rail service to Furman would have been a rare event.

The population was 2,808 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Hampton County. The town and the county are named after Wade Hampton III, a Confederate general in the Civil War. History Hampton County was created from northwestern portions of Beaufort County in 1878 by the South Carolina General Assembly. In appreciation for helping to end the Reconstruction Era and leading the Democratic Party, the county was named after the sitting governor, Wade Hampton III. Upon creation of the county, the town of Hampton Courthouse was incorporated the following year to serve as the county seat. The U.S. Postal Service would later shorten the name to Hampton.http://www.hamptonsc.net/community/history.aspx The location was chosen based on the midpoint location of the Port Royal Railroad between Augusta, Georgia, and Port Royal, in hopes to spur economic development. The town was laid out in an orderly grid pattern, with streets running northeast/southwest being named after trees and streets running northwest/southeast being numbered. The central three-block main street which ran between the courthouse block and the rail depot was named Lee Avenue. Hampton prospered due to its connections with local agricultural fields and became an important depot along the railway. However, the town remained small, though an influx of activity occurred in World War II when a Prisoner-of-War camp was opened near the town. Additional economic development came in the form of industry, with Plywoods-Plastic opening a major facility northwest of town for pulp production. Over time, the company was acquired by Westinghouse and International Paper. IP sold the site to Nevamar, and the facility remained one of the county's largest employers until its closure in late 2014.http://www.southcarolinaradionetwork.com/2014/08/04/nevamar-plant-to- close-in-hampton-costing-more-than-220-jobs/ In recent years, auto-oriented commercial development was focused on the outskirts of town, leaving the original downtown without much activity. The town of Hampton has attempted to bring back commercial and civic activity to Lee Avenue and has undergone a multi-phased streetscape project, which has rendered some success in luring back businesses to downtown.

In 1878, Hampton County was created from Beaufort County, and the site for the county seat was located northwest of Varnville, eventually becoming the town of Hampton.

The population was 457 at the 2010 census. Geography Briarcliffe Acres is located in southeastern Horry County at (33.789267, -78.747300). It is bordered to the north and east by the city of North Myrtle Beach. U.S. Route 17 forms the northern border of the town, leading northeast to the center of North Myrtle Beach and southwest to the center of Myrtle Beach. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History Briarcliffe Acres was developed as a retirement community by Kenneth Ellsworth, a native of Briarcliff Manor, New York (from which he took the name of his project), who married Virginia (Ginny) Gasque (pronounced \\"gas-kwee\\" or, by some, \\"gas- kee\\"). Her family came from the nearby town of Conway, South Carolina. Briarcliffe was one of the first planned communities in the Southeast. In the early (pre-1930) parts of the 20th century, the coastal areas of northernmost South Carolina were used mostly as farming sites. (The real estate monolith now known as Burroughs and Chapin for decades was named \\"Myrtle Beach Farms\\".) Sea breezes washed nutrients on crops planted on sand dunes, much as now is done through roots in hydroponic gardens, and cotton and tobacco thrived; farmers from Loris, Galivants Ferry, Florence and other Lowcountry towns bought land on the coast for practical reasons and then spent summers with their families there, rather than stay in the hellish heat and sand fleas of their main farms. As a result, a few people subsequently built vacation homes in the first resort area, Murrells Inlet, and, later, erected rooming houses north in what would become Myrtle Beach. One influential example was the Patricia Court (later Patricia Inn and now Patricia Grand Resort) started in the 1930s but reaching importance in the late 1940s, built by Patricia Rousseau of North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Further north still, Ken and Ginny Ellsworth recognized that the idea of living at the beach for its own sake could be expanded into a community. They found a large tract of land owned by Elizabeth Patterson, a daughter of Simeon B. Chapin. As soon as it was possible after acquiring the property, the Ellsworths dug a yacht basin on the adjacent Intracoastal Waterway, on the land side of US Highway 17. They built a small cottage between the highway and yacht basin so they could be close both to the wealthy people on the waterway and the potentially larger numbers of people driving down the main road from New York to Miami. (The idea of capitalizing on the highway also motivated Jack Nelson who built the El Rancho Motel, once featured in Life Magazine, about south.) Ken and Ginny cut roads, layered them with coquina (a local mix of sand and fossilized shells), and looked for residents. Among the first people to move in were Ginny's parents, who built a home on what is now North Gate Road, just on the edge of the brow above the drop-down to the beach, backing up to the huge lot owned by the Lewis family (who owned the northernmost fishing pier in the area). The location on the brow‚Äîlike that of Patterson's home, on the opposite end of the property‚Äîwas intended to provide both easy access to the shore and protection from storms (a plan that has worked until the present day). Next came the Sorry (pronounced \\"Sow-ree\\"; rhymes with \\"Horry\\", as in the county) family, who built next to the Gasques. They were followed by the Dutch van Buren family (distant descendants of the American President), who discovered the place by anchoring one night in the yacht basin on a trip south and then visiting the land, deciding to build a home and retire, which proved the wisdom of Ken Ellsworth's original scheme. The van Burens told another Dutch family ‚Äî Anton Frederik and Casperina Hermina Groeneveld Baarslag, friends of theirs from New York and Vermont ‚Äî about the place, who visited and then moved down in 1950. In 1951 Alfred Colby Hockings and his wife ‚Äî he was a well-known illustrator for Field & Stream magazine, originally from Wisconsin but most recently living in the artists' community of Tryon, North Carolina ‚Äî built a home up the street from the Gasques and Sorrys and across from the Baarslags; at almost the same time another Dutch family ‚Äî Gerbrand and Nellie Poster, the son-in-law and daughter of the Baarslags ‚Äî came down from New York City to visit her parents for Christmas, decided to stay, and built a home next door to her parents. (Poster was later to found Coastal Federal Savings and Loan Association and use connections developed during his military service as a Dutch national in the US Army during World War II to help convince the US government to declare that the damage done by Hurricane Hazel in 1954 should be covered by insurance. This made possible the second renaissance of the community, the first having been its emergence from the Great Depression.) At this time, all the homes in Briarcliffe‚Äîexcept for the van Burens, who lived across the road from the central lake, and Elizabeth Patterson, whose home was on what is now Middle Gate Road‚Äîwere clustered along what is now North Gate Road. Two developments, one small and one huge, changed Briarcliffe in ways that remain to this day. The first was the Poster family itself, which when moving in included a seven-year-old and a four-year-old and who were soon joined by a newborn. This changed the tenor of Briarcliffe by moving it from a retirement community to a third (less-expensive) alternative to the Pine Lakes and Dunes sections, all of which offered a place to rear a family close to, but not in, the increasing tawdriness of Myrtle Beach itself. The second was the financial impact of the government's intervention with the insurance companies after Hurricane Hazel. The companies had wanted to declare the damage \\"high water\\", which was not covered; Poster convinced the authorities that the damage had been caused by \\"wind-driven water\\", which was covered. This changed the whole of Myrtle Beach, as payment of claims allowed small rooming houses to be replaced by motels. This impacted the whole of coastal South Carolina, including Briarcliffe. At the same time, the United States Air Force had decided to deal with the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base by treating it as a sort of reward to which people could be assigned if they deserved a vacation, or a punishment for those whose careers were at an end. Many people in both groups chose Briarcliffe as a place in which to build or buy, ranging from Air Force heroes (such as Col. Francis [\\"Gabby\\"] Gabreski, the first pilot to be an \\"ace\\" in two wars) to investors, artists and simple families. The boom in Myrtle Beach led to a boom in Briarcliffe, and soon a community once associated with raccoons and deer became a residential destination. Among the significant people in this new wave must be remembered Rolf Bierens, another Dutchman who‚Äîhaving retired from General Motors thanks to his involvement in the design of their automatic transmission‚Äîfirst built his home with his own hands and then the first cabana. Increasingly, other residents brought histories, such as the then-industrialist Krampf, button-manufacturer Schwanda and developer Passow. Briarcliffe Acres is still a place of lakes, pine and scrub-oak forests and wild animals. Although the surrounding Grand Strand area has changed and been developed, Briarcliffe Acres remains much like it was in the 1960s.

Highlighting the renovation of the downtown area is the Riverwalk, an area of restaurants which follows a stretch of the Waccamaw River that winds through Conway.  History  Conway is one of the oldest towns in South Carolina. Early English colonists named the village \\"Kings Town\\" but soon changed it to \\"Kingston\\". The town was founded in 1732 as part of Royal Governor Robert Johnson's Township Scheme. It was laid out on a bluff overlooking the Waccamaw River in what is now known as Horry County. Many area residents fought in the American Revolution, and small engagements were fought near Kingston at Bear Bluff and at Black Lake. Francis Marion, who was known as the \\"Swamp Fox\\", had an encampment near Kingston just across the Waccamaw River. The areas of Kingston and Charles Town, S.C. were communities with a higher population of Tories than many other Colonial American towns during the revolutionary war era. A Tory was a colonist who supported the government during that period. After the war, patriotic citizens wanted to discard the name that honored Great Britain's King George II. The county's name was changed to Horry (pronounced \\"oh-ree\\") in honor of General Peter Horry in 1801, and a courthouse was established in Kingston. \\"Kingston\\" was later changed to \\"Conwayborough\\", for General Robert Conway. In 1883, the General Assembly changed the name to \\"Conway\\".

Its nickname is \\"The Family Beach\\". The population was 3,837 at the 2010 census, down from 4,425 in 2000. It is considered a part of the Grand Strand. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau Surfside Beach has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.1 km2), of which 1.9 square miles (5.0 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (1.02%) is water. History This portion of beach was mentioned in the 1765 diary of John Bartram, botanist, who lodged at what was presumably Stephen Peak's plantation, \\"at the west end of long bay\\". It was also mentioned in the 1773 journal of William Bartram, naturalist, who also \\"got to the West end of Long Bay, where [he] lodged at a large Indigo plantation.\\" The plantation in question was called \\"The Ark\\", possibly because it was originally owned by \\"Mr. Aark.\\" A 1838 survey recorded it having 3,194 acres. The plantation reported 57 slaves in 1850 and 63 in 1860. The main house was located near the ocean front (at 3rd Ave S and Willow Dr in present-day Surfside Beach) with several slave cabins just to the north along the ocean and a cemetery behind it (S Hollywood Dr on the west, to Juniper Dr on the north, to 6th Ave S on the east, to Cypress Dr on the south.) The main house served as shelter during the great hurricane of 1893. It was later used as an inn then to house beach lifeguards, before it was demolished in the 1960s. The cemetery, where many of the enslaved people of the plantation were buried, continued to be used by descendants of those enslaved families until 1952. In 1980, the town of Surfside Beach declared it abandoned, opening the area for development. The area once occupied by the cemetery is completely covered by residences. Surfside Beach was first incorporated in 1964 with 881 residents. It was previously known as Roach's Beach and had only a few buildings surviving the hurricane of 1893. Principal industries were lumber and feed farming for the 30 or so horses and mules in the area. The new owner, Mr. George J. Holiday, renamed the area Floral Beach for his wife, Flora, and daughter, Floramay. In the late 1920s, a group from Columbia purchased and partially developed the land. In 1952, most of the land changed hands again and became known as Surfside Beach. The undeveloped beach area was covered with sand dunes. A one-lane sandy road led from the highway to a quiet beach. Hurricane Hazel in 1954 destroyed 18 of the beach's 65 houses, but did not dampen the spirit of the developers. Lots were cleared, the sand was leveled, topsoil was brought in and T. J. Harrison, who later became the town's first mayor, opened the first grocery store in 1956 for the six permanent families and summer residents. Significant expansion did not occur until after 1956 when Myrtle Beach Air Force Base was reactivated. By 1964, its reputation as a family beach was further established and the town was becoming a popular place to retire. The new town government increased police protection, mosquito and sanitation control, and street lights and zoning ordinances resulted in increased property values. Public parking and walkways to the beach were established and government offices were constructed. Within the next few years, the town continued to grow through annexation. Improvements were made to streets and water lines and business and residential building boomed. Surfside Beach, as well as the rest of the Grand Strand, became one of the fastest growing parts of the country. Surfside Beach adopted a public-places smoking ban which took effect October 1, 2007. Surfside Beach is the first town in Horry County to enact such a ban, and one of only a handful in South Carolina at the time. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 4,425 persons, 2,150 households, and 1,234 families residing in the town. The population density was 2,287.6 people per square mile (885.2/km2).

The population was 2,952 as of the 2010 census and was estimated to be 6,515 in 2018. Hardeeville is included within the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. For many years, Hardeeville billed itself as the \\"Lowcountry Host\\" due to the prevalence of lodging and traveler-oriented facilities along U.S. Highway 17 and later Interstate 95. In recent years, the city has expanded its economic focus due to high population growth. According to Census estimates, Hardeeville posted the highest population growth rate of any municipality in South Carolina, growing 53.4 percent from 2010 to 2014. Going up: Booming growth along U.S. 278 fuel's Lowcountry's fastest-growing municipalities History Marker indicating the former location of the Purrysburg settlement The earliest European settlement in the region was Purrysburg, a former Swiss Huguenot settlement founded in 1732 on the banks of the Savannah River, about northwest of the current city's center. The settlement ultimately failed, as disease and competition from growing Savannah proved too much for the local settlers to overcome. Many left the immediate area, moving elsewhere in the Lowcountry region (including a new hamlet called Switzerland) or upriver to the new communities of Augusta, Georgia, and Hamburg, South Carolina, though some remained. The area saw some skirmishes between Union and Confederate forces during the Civil War. The Charleston and Savannah Railway (today's CSX Transportation) was considered a prized possession and major strategic goal for Union forces. The Battle of Honey Hill, an effort to defend the railroad, was one of the later battles won by Southern forces in late 1864, shortly before General William Sherman entered South Carolina after his March to the Sea in Georgia. Argent Lumber Company locomotive on display The area within the city was settled in the 19th century by Isaac Hardee, a native from North Carolina. Through the efforts of his son, Whyte William Hardee, a depot and general store along the Charleston and Savannah Railway opened up. This depot and the surrounding areas became collectively known as \\"Hardee's Station\\", and eventually as \\"Hardeeville\\" at the town's founding in 1911. The area became renowned for its timber operations with the Argent Lumber Company, which had one of the largest logging operations in the world. Unique to the area was the swamp logging procedure, with conditions that were far more treacherous than standard logging. narrow-gaugeTap Lines: Shortline & Industrial Railroading in the South railroads were constructed to help deliver timber to a processing area, where the lumber would be lifted onto rail cars or trucks headed to all parts of North America. As a tribute to Argent's impact on the community, the city was donated an H.K. Porter 2-8-0 steam locomotive (c/n 4776, built January 1911), Argent Lumber Company Number 7, for display in 1960.Ferrell, Mallory Hope, \\"Argent Lumber Company ...Last of the Swamp Rats\\", Light & Industrial Railway Quarterly, Fontana, California, Summer 1984, Volume 2, Number 4, page 7. Growth continued at a modest pace throughout the rest of the 20th century, though timbering operations were gradually scaled back as overseas lands became more sought after due to lower costs and more standard logging procedures. In spite of the decline of the logging industry, the construction of U.S. Route 17 and later Interstate 95 provided a new type of commerce: motorist services such as motels, restaurants, and gas stations. The development of Hilton Head Island to the southeast as a resort destination had a further impact on the community, with an additional interstate exit providing greater commercial opportunity and affordable costs of living for service employees who moved to the city. At the start of the 21st century, development pressures along the U.S. Route 278 corridor became a central concern for city leaders. In response, Hardeeville began to annex large undeveloped parcels of land that were previously held by timbering and paper concerns. These annexations were done in order to guide new growth into larger planned developments, increasing the city limits from in 2000 to over in 2010. In 2004, Core Communities became the first company to sign a development agreement with the city and began constructing Tradition Hilton Head. In the following years, other developments have begun or announced plans at developing in these areas. Although the recession beginning in late 2007 significantly slowed the pace of development, the city has continued to grow due to continuous commitments from existing developers, and new investment related to industrial and commercial opportunities. These investments have allowed the city to make improvements to its existing areas in the form of streetscaping projects, improved community facilities, and general reinvestment. Geography Hardeeville is located south of the center of Jasper County at (32.283850, -81.078496). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of in 2010, of which were land and , or 0.24%, were water. Nearly 90 percent of the city limits was annexed between 2000 and 2010, primarily to accommodate large, planned development communities located on former lands devoted to logging and timber harvesting. The city is located on the Atlantic coastal plain, with very few variations in elevation. The average elevation of the city is approximately above mean sea level. Most of Hardeeville is located within Jasper County, though a small portion of the city crosses into Beaufort County. Much of the city is bordered to the west by the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, a large-scale nature preserve along the South Carolina and Georgia sides of the Savannah River. Neighborhoods Although a small community in terms of population, Hardeeville is among the 10 largest municipalities in South Carolina based on incorporated limits. The city has a small downtown area along with newly developing areas primarily along the U.S. 278 corridor. At the present time, there are two distinct population centers: Downtown and New River. \\"Downtown\\" or \\"Historic Hardeeville\\" refers generally to the original city limit extents of the community, bound between Exits 5 and 8 along I-95 and between the interstate and the CSX rail line. Downtown consists mostly of one-story single-family homes and one- to two-story apartments. Main Street (S.C. 46) and Whyte Hardee Boulevard (U.S. 17) provide the majority of commercial development in downtown. Locally oriented commerce is located along Main Street and northern portions of Whyte Hardee Boulevard. Nearby neighborhoods often associated with downtown include Car Moorer Acres, Pine Arbor, Heritage Place, Jenny Greeene, and Deerfield Village. The \\"New River\\" area of Hardeeville contains large- scale planned developments along the U.S. 278 and Argent Boulevard corridors. A vast majority of population growth since 2005 has been attributed to these developments, which were annexed into the city between 2004 and 2010. These developments include Hilton Head Lakes, Hampton Pointe, Hearthstone Lakes, and Jasper County portions of Sun City Hilton Head. Additional neighborhoods include the Courtney Bend apartments and Camp Lake Jasper, an RV park. Culture=Media Hardeeville's weekly newspaper of record is Hardeeville Today, a subsidiary of the Savannah Morning News. Other local newspapers that serve the community include the Jasper County Sun and the Island Packet. The city of Hardeeville also owns and operates a public affairs channel (HTVN Channel 9) that can be seen on Hargray cable services. Broadcast channels shown on local services originate in the Savannah market.

Religion The city is home to several Christian denominations, with most churches located in the downtown area. Other religious faiths have houses of worship in surrounding communities, especially in Beaufort, Hilton Head, and Savannah. Economy Downtown Hardeeville has traditionally been the center of commercial activity in the city, with traveler services along U.S. 17 mixing together with more local- oriented businesses along Main Street. Hardeeville's two exits along Interstate 95 are some of South Carolina's more popular stopping points, with traveler-oriented commercial services. Although Exit 5 has been in existence longer and has more commercial activity, Exit 8 has experienced recent commercial growth as well. Exit 8 also is the access point to the local hospital and a popular county park located within of the exit. Among industrial and business park locations, the Hardeeville Industrial Park is among the most successful locations in the city, connected both to road and rail networks. Additional light industrial development is occurring in other areas of the city, especially along the Argent Boulevard and Highway 170 corridors. In addition to existing industrial locations, the proposed RiverPort development on the western and southern edges of the city intends to focus on logistics, transportation, and port-related industrial uses along the U.S. Highway 17 corridor. A future Exit 3 along Interstate 95 is planned to facilitate industrial development in RiverPort and alleviate truck congestion through downtown Hardeeville. New commercial opportunities are planned for along the U.S. 278 corridor.

It is near the center of the Cofitachequi chiefdom that existed in the 1500s. In 1730, Camden became part of a township plan ordered by King George II. Kershaw County's official website states, \\"Originally laid out in 1732 as the town of Fredericksburg in the Wateree River swamp (south of the present town) when King George II ordered eleven inland townships established along South Carolina's rivers, few of the area settlers chose to take lots surveyed in the town, choosing the higher ground to the north. The township soon disappeared.\\" In 1758, Joseph Kershaw from Yorkshire, England, came into the township, established a store and renamed the town \\"Pine Tree Hill\\". Camden became the main inland trade center in the colony. Kershaw suggested that the town be renamed Camden, in honor of Lord Camden, a champion of colonial rights in the British Parliament. In the 1770s it was the site of an early American porcelain factory, established by John Bartlam  American Revolution  May 1780 brought the American Revolution to Charleston, South Carolina, when it fell under the Crown's control. Lord Charles Cornwallis and 2,500 of his Loyalist and British troops marched to Camden and established there the main British supply post for the Southern campaign. The Battle of Camden, the worst American defeat of the Revolution, was fought on August 16, 1780, near Camden, and on April 25, 1781, the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill was fought between about 1,400 troops led by General Nathanael Greene and 950 Loyalists and British soldiers led by Lord Francis Rawdon. The latter battle was a costly win for the British, and forced them to leave Camden and retreat to the coast. After the Revolution, Camden's prominence and wealth grew as a major interior trading town with direct ties to Charleston and the world. Regional products, augmented with goods from the interior of North Carolina and far lands to the west were transported from Camden to Charleston on flat-bottom riverboats that plied the adjacent Wateree River before the railroad arrived in 1842.  American Civil War and later years  Camden was the source of six Confederate generals during the American Civil War. Richard Rowland Kirkland ‚Äì \\"The Angel of Marye's Heights\\" ‚Äì is interred in the Old Quaker Cemetery. At the end of the war, components of Sherman's army burned Confederate and nearby properties, including a full block of downtown buildings. The last Federal officer killed in the Civil War was 1st Lt E.L. Stevens of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry who died in a skirmish 9 miles south of Camden at the Battle of Boykin's Mill on April 18, 1865. Starting in the mid-1880s the Camden area became an increasingly popular destination for wealthy northern families to spend the winter. Eventually three resort hotels provided winter tourism activities well into the 1930s and beyond. The town became associated with many equestrian activities, and is now the home of the third oldest active polo field in America. In the winter, more than 1,500 thoroughbreds call the area home. According to Kershaw County's web site, \\"Horse related activities became very popular. That interest in equine activities has continued and today the horse industry is a major part of the county economy. For that reason, the city is known as the 'Steeplechase Capital of the World'.\\" Aerial view of the Orlon Plant in Camden.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Elgin lies within the Carolina Sandhills region of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province. This region is characterized by many dunes of wind- blown sand that were active during the last ice age (when conditions were colder, drier, and windier) but the dunes are currently stabilized by vegetation under modern climate conditionsSwezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., Whittecar, G.R., Mahan, S.A., Garrity, C.P., Aleman Gonzalez, W.B., and Dobbs,K.M., 2016, The Carolina Sandhills: Quaternary eolian sand sheets and dunes along the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, southeastern United States: Quaternary Research, v. 86, p. 271-286.. White Pond, a noted landmark on maps since the early 1800s, is a depression among these stabilized (vegetated) dunes. One dune on the south side of White Pond has yielded a luminescence date of ~92,300 years before present (BP)Swezey, C.S., 2020, \\"Quaternary eolian dunes and sand sheets in inland locations of the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province\\", in Inland Dunes of North America (N.

White Pond has recently attracted scientific attention as having preserved a relatively long record of sediment accumulation in the pond. Several scientists have taken various core samples from White Pond that could reveal information on temperatures of non-glaciated areas during the Ice Age, and information on plant and animal life in the area during the past.Watts, W.A., 1980, Late-Quaternary vegetation history at White Pond on the inner Coastal Plain of South Carolina: Quaternary Research, v. 13, 187-199.Krause, T.R., Russell, J.M., Zhang, R., Williams, J.W., and Jackson, S.T., 2019, Late Quaternary vegetation, climate, and fire history of the southeast Atlantic Coastal Plain based on a 30,000-yr mult-proxy record from White Pond, South Carolina, USA: Quaternary Research, v. 91, no. 2, p. 861-880.

History Elgin, previously named \\"Blaney\\", and originally \\"Jeffers\\", traces its European-American history to a post office established in the area in 1898. The small community that the post office served adopted the name Jeffers after its first postmaster, William T. Jeffers. The community did not see much growth until the Seaboard Air Line Railroad began expansion in the area in 1900. Development occurred near the railroad depot and post office. Seaboard agents, in an effort to increase use of the rail line, promoted business all along its route, including Jeffers. The town, and post office, was eventually renamed Blaney in honor of a New York banker who helped fund the railroad expansion in the region. The town of Blaney was officially chartered and incorporated on January 23, 1907. Blaney's first postmaster, Jesse T. Ross (who served for forty-seven years), was the first man to open a business, together with D. D. Evans. The village erected a brick schoolhouse was erected in 1912. Very little growth was seen in the town during the next 15 years; the Camden Chronicle said in 1927: \\"I don't think there were fifty people in [Blaney], in fact you wouldn't know it was a town.\\" However, by 1930, Blaney had built its own high school. In 1931 U.S. Highway 1 was completed. A fully paved road extending along the length of the eastern seaboard, it ran parallel to the already established rail line as it cut through Blaney. This offered a new route to bring in tourism and business to the area. It is still the main route into the town today. In the late 1950s, postwar industrial development took place throughout the West Wateree Area along U.S. Highway 1. In 1958 a deal was closed with the Whitehead Brothers Sand Company, which opened up a $300,000 sand foundry between Lugoff and Blaney. State Senator John West recruited the Elgin National Watch Company in 1962 to relocate to the area. The company was attracted to the unused land and potential labor market to be recruited from nearby Columbia. Residents voted to change the town's name from Blaney to Elgin in a landslide 61-16 vote. In September 1962, plans were confirmed to build a $1 million assembly plant in the town. The plant offered 240 jobs and received over a thousand applications when the hiring process started. Due to the new plant, the town upgraded the area's water supply system. By 1963, Elgin was drilling wells as part of a new $150,000 water system, and the plant had begun production. In 1967, officials from the Elgin National Watch Company announced that the plant would be sold to B. F. Goodrich, a manufacturer of tennis shoes, due to the company's inability to compete with foreign-made products. That year, the Hardwicke Chemical Company broke ground at a 15-acre site near Elgin. Elgin's growth has continued in recent years. In 2005, a new sewer system was completed for the town and a new municipal complex was finished to house the town hall, police department, and fire station. The town grew by over 50% between the 2000 and 2010 census, going from 806 to 1311 residents with continued growth expected in the future. Elgin's current mayor is Melissa Emmons. Transportation Since 1931, US Route 1 has been the town's Main Street, running parallel to Interstate 20. Exit 87, southeast of the town center, provides access from I-20.

The population was 9,139 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Laurens County. History Located in the Upstate region of South Carolina, the city of Laurens is named after Henry Laurens, a South Carolina merchant and rice planter who was one of America's wealthiest slave traders. He was a delegate to and second president of the Continental Congress and served as a diplomat. It is part of the Greenville-Mauldin-Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area. Laurens was established by an act of the General Assembly on March 15, 1785, as a location for commercial activities. It was one of the six counties created from the Old Ninety-Six District of South Carolina. Laurens was originally named Laurensville. On December 15, 1845, a charter was issued with the name of Laurensville. The first appearance of the town named Laurens was in an 1873 charter. The town of Laurens was chartered in 1900 and in 1916. It was named in honor of South Carolina statesman Henry Laurens. The first inhabitants of Laurens were the Cherokee Indians. They used the land as their hunting and fighting ground. There has been evidence of broken potsherds, weapons, and a mound found linked to Cherokee culture on land now called Laurens. Many treaties were made with the Cherokee over the land known as Laurens County dating to 1721. Before the American Revolution thousands of immigrants, mainly from Scotland and Ireland, settled in Laurens County. Later Laurens developed into a major intersection of commerce in colonial America. In the Battle of Musgrove Mill, Laurens witnessed intense fighting. In 1790, after the Revolutionary War, Laurens was elected as the county seat. Like other southern towns, cotton was its major crop. High cotton production led to an economic boom and a substantial increase in the African American population due to the use of African slaves on cotton plantations. The economic boom attracted wealthy entrepreneurs and businessmen to Laurens. President Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor in downtown Laurens from 1824 to 1826. Before the beginning of the American Civil War, Laurens provided a great deal of political leaders to the state government. The state's decision to secede from the Union was influenced by many of them. The fighting of the Civil War never neared Laurens, but it was affected by the influx of refugees fleeing Charleston to avoid the progressing Union Army and Navy. Several of the refugees settled in Laurens after the war. In the postwar Reconstruction years, Laurens's economy evolved to include industry. The economic recovery relied upon the creation of the textiles and manufacturing industries. Lauren Cotton Mill was founded in 1895 and Watts Mill in 1902. Laurens Glass Company was established in 1910, and was one of the largest glass plants in the southeast for over 80 years. The Laurens Railroad Company was chartered in 1847. The Columbia-Newberry-Laurens Railroad and the Charleston-Western Carolina Railroad are the two major intersections provided by the railroad. Historic Laurens County Courthouse Laurens and Laurens County is part of the Old 96 District, which also includes Abbeville County, Greenwood County, McCormick County, and Edgefield County. The textile, manufacturing, and glass industries were at one point a major source of employment. Although many of the textile plants and the glass production facilities have closed over the last 30 years, a variety of industries exist within the county, including corporations like CeramTec, International Paper, Milliken & Co. and others. Walmart operates a distribution center outside the city near Interstate 385, which is a major employer. The area has seen several recent economic retail developments, and is seeing new capital investment in heavy industry, including a major new transmission production facility for German ZF Group. The unemployment rate as of February 2012 was 9.6%. Laurens was the town chosen for a makeover in the second season of Town Haul. Laurens is home to Reverend Gary Davis and Pink Anderson, acoustic blues musicians who were born in the city, as well as Redtop Davis, a lightweight boxer of the 1940s and 1950s. James \\"JT\\" Taylor, the lead singer of the funk/R&B; band Kool & The Gang, grew up in Laurens. Historic places The Courthouse Square consists of four acres that was purchased in 1792 for two guineas, which is around $21,000 (Bolick, 1982). The Laurens County Courthouse is placed in the center of the square. The current courthouse is the third courthouse. The first courthouse was constructed of wood. It was used as a church, school, and courthouse. The second courthouse was made of brick. Dr. John Wells Simpson built the third courthouse in 1838. The courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Laurens‚Äô church district has two historic churches, which are located on Caroline Street. Bethel AME Church (torn down in the mid 2010s) is one of the historic churches in the district. Columbus White, a former slave and builder, designed the church in 1910. But the first church structure was built in 1868. In 1877, Saint Paul First Baptist, which neighbors Bethel AME Church, was established. Columbus White also built Saint Paul First Baptist in 1912. The church is styled in Gothic Revival. The church also served as the county's first African American public school until 1937. The Church of the Epiphany is Lauren's oldest church building still operating. The church was constructed in 1846. The First United Methodist Church represents Romanesque Revival architecture. The church was built in 1897. In 1834, the First Baptist Church was originally built. The name of the original church was Laurensville Baptist Church. In 1850, the first sanctuary was built. In 1893, the second church was constructed. The present sanctuary was built in 1958. The First Presbyterian Church was organized on April 1, 1832, but the present church structure was built in 1891.

History Bishopville was known as Singleton's Crossroads for more than a decade before it was renamed in honor of Jacques Bishop. The of land had been granted to Jacob Chamber by the state of South Carolina in 1786. Daniel Carter later purchased the property and then sold it to William Singleton in 1790. The tavern owned and operated by Singleton and his wife sat at the intersection of Mecklenburg Road, now Church Street, and McCallum Ferry Road, now Main Street. This tavern was a stop on the stagecoach route between Georgetown and Charlotte. (Now this intersection involves Highway 15, which at one point was the premier north‚Äìsouth route from New York to Miami.) In 1798, William Singleton died, leaving his wife the owner of the tavern until her death in 1820. A year later in 1821, the property was sold to Bishop. During this time period the area around present-day Bishopville was said to be composed of mostly wilderness, with only a few scattered, primitive houses. Lee County was created in 1892 with Bishopville its county seat, but Bishopville did not complete building its courthouse and county jail until February 1902. As a result, county boundaries were delimited along Lynches River, Black River, Scape Ore Swamp, Sparrow Swamp, Long Branch, and Screeches Branch following old roads and artificial limits. On December 15, 1902, Bishopville celebrated its new significance by hosting speeches and shooting off the old cannon in front of the Lee County Courthouse. Lee County has historically been a leader in cotton production in the state and is the home of the South Carolina Cotton Museum. In addition to the Lee County Courthouse, the Ashwood School Gymnasium and Auditorium, Bishopville Commercial Historic District, James Carnes House, Dennis High School, Thomas Fraser House, William Apollos James House, The Manor, Mt.

The population of Chapin was 1,445 according to the 2010 census, however, the population of the area with a Chapin mailing address, which is all known as Chapin by local people, is 6,742. Chapin is located approximately northwest of Columbia and many people commute there for work; however, the town is considered fringe rural by the US postal service.

Lake Murray is the main attraction to Chapin and provides recreational boaters with water-related entertainment. History Chapin is named after Martin Chapin who traveled south. After Martin Chapin and Laura Anne Benjamin were married on June 16, 1850, the couple moved down South because of Martin's health (a lung condition). The Chapins were living in Columbia, South Carolina when Martin's doctor suggested he to move to the Piney Woods area. He bought property in this area, and over the years Chapin bought 4,218 acres. He built a home in Piney Woods and later a hotel in the 1880s along the new rail line that ran from Columbia, South Carolina to Laurens, South Carolina. The railroad provided a way to trade and transport goods to the capital city. Cotton and the lumber industry were flourishing with the railroad providing transportation . After Martin's death on August 31, 1894, Laura Chapin sold their Chapin home and moved into the Chapin hotel. On March 28, 1907, Job S. Wessinger, P.M. Frick, and J. S. Honeycut founded the Bank of Chapin. One year later the building for the bank was built. The bank prospered with help from the railroad. During World War I, Chapin was doing well economically. The price of cotton had risen and the farmers were making plenty of money. As a result, The Bank of Chapin was also thriving during this time. In addition, the first high school was built in 1924. Slowly the businesses in Chapin were starting to experience hard times nearing the 1930s. On Thursday, October 15, 1931 the Bank of Chapin did not open, and like other banks around the world, the Bank of Chapin would not allow customers to withdraw their money. Anybody who had money saved in the bank lost that money due to the crash of the stock market, later known as the start of the Great Depression. Another disaster to hit Chapin was the building of the dam on the Saluda River that would result in the building of a lake. This lake would take over most of the Chapin families‚Äô farm and homeland. The building of the dam was started in 1927. In the midst of the Great Depression Chapin started a recreational team sport of baseball. In 1935, the Dutch Fork League was formed where Chapin had its own team. This team helped the unemployed men occupy their time during these difficult times. These baseball games attracted thousands of people. The midpoint in Chapin's history is the 1940s. During this period Chapin grew through improvements on the school and opening new businesses. One new business that came to Chapin was filling stations. The next business was a cabinet shop called E. A. Frick and Son. Chapin also built paved roads, a baseball field and established the public library. In 1950 the first post office building was constructed, along with new telephone services. The 1960s were about new and better services. Garbage collection was an issue in the 60s, so the town government bought land and built a landfill. Transportation was the next service provided by access to an interstate. On September 7, 1960 a section of the interstate was opened between Columbia and Pomaria, South Carolina. The interstate made Chapin more accessible. Streets in town were also improved. Another improvement of the 60s was the new water system. Later during 1965 a volunteer fire department was organized. Then in 1966, the town had its first ambulance. Chapin also started growing in population as more people moved to Chapin in the 1960s. During the 1970s new schools were built. Chapin football also became a community event because the school football team won two state championships in 1973 and 1974. Also in the 70s churches in the town of Chapin were growing by establishment of Chapin Baptist Church, St. Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church, Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church, and Lake Murray Presbyterian Church. The Robinson-Hiller House was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Geography Chapin is located at (34.165783, -81.347260). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and 0.55% is water. While Chapin is a part of Lexington County, the creation of Lake Murray by the Dreher Shoals Dam cut Chapin off from the rest of the county, creating something of an exclave. Demographics According to the 2000 Census, the incorporated limits of the Town of Chapin had a population of 628. The census counted 249 occupied housing units within the town. Per capita income was $24,124. Median household income within the town limits was $48,750. The 2010 Census, records that Chapin has a population of 1,445 with 658 total housing units within town limits. Government Chapin's mayor and the town council run for a four-year term. The council has chosen a Mayor-Council form of government. This means that the mayor has more majority status than council members. Chapin's town government is made up of three council members, a mayor pro tem, and a mayor. Currently the Mayor of Chapin is David W. Knight. The Mayor Pro Tem is Al Koon along with the council members who are Al Koon, Leland Teal, and Kay Hollis. History In 1940 the mayor was S. J. Cannon. He served a one-year term along with officers W.W. Goza, H. E. Metts, Carl Shealy, and W. B. Fulmer. Other offices voted on during this election were town clerk and policeman. The next year, 1941, W. W. Goza was elected mayor and served until 1944. In 1944, J. L. Amick was elected mayor. Numerous others have served as mayor between J. L. Amick and David W. Knight. Education *Chapin High School *Chapin Middle School *Chapin Intermediate School * Chapin Elementary School * Lake Murray Elementary School *Spring Hill High School History of local schools The first school in Chapin was located in the Chapin house. In 1924 a high school was built out of concrete blocks and brick. In 1927 the school alma mater ‚ÄúChapin, Dear Chapin‚Äù was composed by Helen Miller. This alma mater is the same one used at Chapin High School today. Chapin schools and churches were the center of life in town according to historian Addison Bostain. Chapin High School had 150 students enrolled in 1929 and the elementary school had 150 students. The school only housed 11 grades. Chapin High School had been built in separate parts since 1924 and by 1940 the high school still did not have a gym. The school auditorium was home to both the theater and a basketball court. The gymnasium was not built until 1952. The Chapin community built the gym for less than $30,000 dollars. The 12th grade was added to Chapin High School in 1948 as well as the first football team. The football team was a very expensive investment, so in 1952 the Irmo and Chapin High School football teams were combined. Together they were known as the Flying Dutchmen football team. The teams separated again, and Chapin has had its own team since 1959. In 1970 a new high school was built with much better facilities. The school had new labs, band, chorus, and physical educational areas. In addition to a new building, the Chapin football team became a powerhouse for football in state of South Carolina. Cecil Woolbright became Chapin High School's head football coach and athletic director in 1968. The Chapin High School Eagles won two state championships and three conference titles in three years. This happened in 1973, 74 and 75, along with a 30-game winning streak. The Chapin High School's mascot is named Cecil the Eagle. A new elementary school opened in August 1977. The school could house 840 children. Library Chapin has a public library, a branch of the Lexington County Library. Churches The first church established in Chapin was Mt. Horeb Lutheran Church in 1891. The Chapin Methodist Church was established in 1889, but was not within town limits until 1892. Again in 1892, Mt. Zion Baptist Church was started with an African American congregation. Another church for African Americans was St. John's AME church, which is older than Mt. Zion, but the date is unknown. Much later in 1972 was the start of Chapin Baptist Church. Lake Murray Presbyterian Church was organized in 1974. Next to arrive in Chapin was St. Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church in 1977. Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church was established in 1978. *Chapin Baptist Church *Chapin Community Church *Chapin Fellowship Bible Church *Chapin Presbyterian Church *Chapin United Methodist Church *Lake Murray Presbyterian Church *Mt.

On September 21, 1927, work on the dam for the Saluda River was started. The construction finished on the June 30, 1930. Chapin families who had lived on Chapin land for over 200 years had to sell and move to make room for the lake that was a result of the dam. The lake was to spread between Dutch Fork and Chapin becoming 14 miles wide and 40 miles long. The earthen dam stands over 200 feet tall and runs 1.5 miles across. Lake Murray has over 500 miles of shoreline and covers approximately 50,000 acres. The dam itself takes up 99 acres. The dam on Lake Murray has been through many changes since it was originally built in 1927. In 1943 three feet was added to the dam's height to help flooding issues. Much later in the 1980s SCE&G; added a sheet piling way on the lakeside of the highway again to help with flooding. This sheet piling way raised the height of the dam again. The latest changes to the dam occurred in 2002 when the backup dam was built. The backup dam was built for more protection to withstand earthquakes. The backup dam is made of rock and concrete to withstand the weight of the water behind the dam if any damage were to occur to the existing dam. Lake Murray is not only used to provide electrical power for surrounding areas, it brings boating activities to the town of Chapin. Lake Murray offers many different types of boating opportunities in addition to recreational areas. Today, the lake has recreational swimming, boating, skiing, fishing, and wake-boarding. The lake also holds fishing tournaments and is home to all kinds of wildlife. Lake Murray is known for its purple martins, striped bass, and great blue heron. Labor Day Festival Chapin is home to the Chapin Labor Day Festival. The Chapin Labor Day Festival is held every year in the town of Chapin on Labor Day. The festival lasts for three days starting on the Saturday before Labor Day and ending on Labor Day. On Monday, the festival activities start off with a parade through town and often features local, state and sometimes national political candidates. The Chapin High School NJROTC also marches in the parade annually. After the parade there is a carnival, Chapin Idol, vendors, food, concerts, and a car show along the historic streets of downtown Chapin.

A mountain bike (MTB) or mountain bicycle is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share some similarities with other bicycles, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include a suspension fork, large knobby tires, more durable wheels, more powerful brakes, straight handlebars, lower gear-ratios for climbing steep grades and sometimes rear suspension to really smooth out the trail. Mountain bikes are generally specialized for use on mountain trails, single track, fire roads, and other unpaved surfaces, although perhaps the majority of them are never used off-pavement, and it is common to find hybrid road bikes based on \\"mountain-bike\\" frames for sale. Mountain biking terrain commonly has rocks, roots, loose dirt, and steep grades. Many trails have additional TTFs (Technical Trail Features) such as log piles, log rides, rock gardens, skinnies, gap jumps, and wall-rides. Mountain bikes are built to handle these types of terrain and features. The heavy-duty construction combined with stronger rims and wider tires has also made this style of bicycle popular with urban riders and couriers who must navigate through potholes and over curbs.Olsen, J. (1999). Mountain biking. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books. Since the development of the sport of mountain biking in the 1970s, many new subtypes of mountain biking have developed, such as cross-country (XC), enduro/all mountain, freeride, downhill, and a variety of track and slalom types. Each of these place different demands on the bike, requiring different designs for optimal performance. MTB development has led to an increase in suspension travel, now often up to , and gearing up to 27 speeds, to facilitate both climbing and rapid descents. Advances in gearing have also led to a \\"1x\\" (pronounced \\"one-by\\") trend, simplifying the gearing to one chainring in the front and a cassette at the rear, typically with 9 to 12 sprockets. The expressions \\"all terrain bicycle\\", \\"all terrain bike\\", and the acronym \\"ATB\\" are used as synonyms for \\"mountain bike\\", but some authors consider them pass√©. History cross country mountain bike race. The original mountain bikes were modified heavy cruiser bicycles used for freewheeling down mountain trails. The sport became popular in the 1970s in Northern California, USA, with riders using older, single-speed balloon tire bicycles to ride down rugged hillsides. These modified bikes were called \\"ballooners\\" in California, \\"klunkers\\" in Colorado, and \\"dirt bombers\\" in Oregon. Joe Breeze, a bicycle frame builder, used this idea and developed what is considered the first mountain bike. It was not until the late 1970s and early 1980s that road bicycle companies started to manufacture mountain bicycles using high-tech lightweight materials, such as M4 aluminum. The first production Mountain bike available was the 1979 Lawwill Pro Cruiser. The frame design was based on a frame that Don Koski fabricated from electrical conduit and a Schwinn Varsity frame. Mert Lawwill had Terry Knight of Oakland build the frames. The bikes sold for about $500 new and were made from 1979 though 1980 (approximate run of 600 bikes). The first mass production mountain bike was the Specialized Stumpjumper, first produced in 1981. With the rising popularity of mountain bikes, Randolph (Randy) Ross, executive vice president of Ross Bicycles Inc., was quoted in the New York Times saying I'd say these bikes are one of the biggest things that ever happened to the biking industry. Its basic look constitutes \\"a total shift in image\\" for the industry. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, mountain biking moved from a little-known sport to a mainstream activity complete with an international racing circuit and a world championship, in addition to various free ride competitions, such as the FMB World Tour and the Red Bull Rampage. Designs Mountain bikes can usually be divided into four broad categories based on suspension configuration: *Rigid: A mountain bike with large, knobby tires and straight handlebars, but with neither front nor rear suspension. *Hard Tail: A mountain bike equipped with a suspension fork for the front wheel, but otherwise a rigid frame. *Soft Tail: A recent addition, a mountain bike with pivots in the frame but no rear shock. the flex of the frame absorbs some vibrations. These bikes are usually cross country bikes. *Full suspension (or dual suspension): A mountain bike equipped with both front and rear suspension. The front suspension is usually a telescopic fork similar to that of a motorcycle, and the rear is suspended by a mechanical linkage with components for absorbing shock. Discipline-oriented designs There are several different styles of mountain biking, usually defined by the terrain, and therefore the type of bicycles employed. Styles have evolved rapidly. In the earliest days, all were somewhat custom, home-built machines, and were used for any number of stunts, tricks, racing or other activities. The general design was similar. As the sport grew, more specialized designs and equipment were introduced. The further market segmentation beyond simple front suspension XC bicycles began to occur in the mid-1990s, as large bicycle and equipment manufacturers were able to cater specifically to changing demands. Today, there are a large variety of discipline oriented designs. They are no longer the bicycle that our parents grew up with. Mountain bikes can be multi-thousand dollar machines that are purpose built for the discipline they were designed for. =Cross- country= These bicycles are designed primarily around the discipline of racing. Emphasis is on endurance which demands lightweight and efficient designs. In the 1980s and early 1990s, this typically consisted of a lightweight steel rigid frame and fork. Throughout the 1990s, lightweight aluminum frames and short travel (65 to 110 mm) suspension forks gained influence. Full suspension designs have since become more popular among racers and enthusiasts. The use of advanced carbon fiber composites allows designers to produce full-suspension designs under . However, hard tails and soft tails are seen quite often in this discipline as well. 700c wheels have largely replaced the original standard of 26\\" and now 29\\" wheels are taking over this discipline. Typical head angles are 70‚Äì71¬∞, a geometry which favors climbing ability and fast responses over descending and stability. Although intended for off-road use, they are not designed for use on steep or particularly rough terrain. =Trail= These bicycles are a development from cross country and are generally used by recreational cyclists. They typically have 120‚Äì140 mm (5\\") of travel, weigh , with geometry situated somewhere between cross country and All-Mountain designs. Having a slacker head angle (66-68¬∞) provides greater stability while descending. With less of an emphasis on weight, typically they are designed to handle rougher terrain. Trail bikes are usually seen as hard tails, and full suspension frames. The frame material is usually seen using aluminum or carbon fiber but is sometimes seen using steel. They usually have either 27.5\\" or 29\\" wheels. Trail Bikes also are seen as the do it all mountain bike. This is due to the fact that they climb very well and descend decently good. Because they have less suspension travel they can be used on a flat pedal trails one day and on the next they can be used to climb and descend mountains with ease. Examples include the Giant Trance, the Trek Fuel EX, and the Specialized Stump Jumper. =Enduro/all-mountain= These bicycles bridge the gap between Trail Bikes and Downhill Bikes. Typically weight is . The frame materials are usually aluminum or carbon fiber. Features include longer full suspension designs, frequently as much as or . The Dampening of the suspension is often adjustable to help with climbing and descending. Head angles are even more relaxed at 65-66¬∞ but are increasingly getting more slack. They are designed to be able to climb decently and descend very well. These bikes are usually taken on all-day rides, hence the term 'all-mountain'. There has been a split between Enduro and All-Mountain designs, with the Enduro placing more emphasis on descent due to the increased emphasis on timed downhill runs in racing when compared to more typical all- mountain riding, this category of mountain bikes is becoming one of the more popular disciplines (2020). Examples include the Trek Slash and Specialized Enduro. =Downhill= Downhill/Freeride bike: Specialized Bighit 2006 with of travel in the front and of travel in the back. Typically having or more of suspension travel, and extremely low, slack geometry (head angles of 63-64¬∞). These designs set the rider in a comfortable position when descending steep trails at high speed. Due to their often high gear ratios, and soft suspension these are ideal only for riding down dedicated trails or race courses, almost universally requiring carrying uphill rather than riding. Frames are often intended for racing, and as such are required to be both extremely durable and lightweight. Designers often make use of similar materials in the construction of Downhill and cross country frames and components despite their vastly different purposes, as the ultimate goal of a high strength to weight ratio is the same. More advanced frame and component designs have produced high-end designs with similar weights to average Trail and All-Mountain models, with an increasing expectation that complete bicycles remain below 40 lbs (18 kg) even in budget models. This advancement, along with increased speeds and forces in racing, and the use of specific frames for freeride applications, has necessitated or otherwise inspired many unique design features and advancements, many of which later find use on less aggressive designs. These aggressive designs are seen in the form of bash guards, clutch derailleurs, wide handlebars, advanced air suspension, bimetallic brake rotors, slack and long geometry. Several types of bicycle speed records have been registered using Downhill bicycles. Examples include the Trek Session and Specialized Demo. =Freeride= Similar to downhill, though with less emphasis on weight and more on strength. These designs feature ample suspension, having at least of travel. Emphasis is on trail features with large air time such as jumps and drops. As such, they handle heavy impacts. Frames and parts are rarely made from carbon fiber due to strength and durability concerns and are instead usually made from aluminum, sacrificing marginal weight gain for more predictable material response under heavy usage. Pedaling efficiency and maneuverability are compromised when climbing. Originally, free-ride bikes sat between all-mountain and downhill in geometry, with frame angles steeper than those found in downhill and higher rider positioning, enhancing maneuverability on technical or low-speed features commonly found on \\"North Shore\\" style trails. Weights range from , with the wide variability resulting from the variety of components applicable for the purpose. Slopestyle and Dirt Jump bikes are included in this category by some, due to similar purposes, but the distinction in design is significant. North Shore bikes are much like free-ride bikes in their geometry and downhill bikes in their component makeup. Because north shore stunts have evolved to not only include simple and complex bridges but also large drops and high-speed descents through a series of stunts north shore bikes commonly have as much travel as downhill and freeride bikes, however with much more nimble and maneuverable frame designs, and often lighter weight. =Dirt jumping urban and street= Somewhere between BMX and free-ride, designs are rigid or hard-tail with of front suspension. Durable frames with low bottom brackets and short chainstays improve maneuverability. Designs often overlap with Four-Cross, with many frames including removable derailleur hangers and/or integrated chain tensioners to allow for single speed and multi-speed arrangements. Tires are usually 24 or 26\\" diameter, fast-rolling slicks or semi-slicks, with narrow casings (approx. 1.8-2.2\\"). Low seatposts and oversized handlebars and used to make room for tricks. Most have an extended rear brake cable installed and have no front brake, which allows the rider to spin the handle bars multiple times without tangling cables. =Slopestyle= A blend of Dirt Jump and Free-ride, having the geometry similar to Dirt Jumpers, but with approximately 4\\" (100mm) of suspension travel in both the front and rear. These bikes are mostly used by professional slope-style riders, this specific usage being their origin, and as such are designed for the extremely large jumps and high speeds encountered in competition. The frames are either adapted from existing All-Mountain or Free- ride designs or designed specifically for the purpose, with durable frame designs and sophisticated suspension linkages to make the most of their minimal suspension travel. These bikes usually have relatively slack head angles, relative to their short suspension travel, with a slightly more aggressive overall geometry than the Dirt Jumpers many are based on. These bikes are often equipped with a mix of Dirt Jump and All-Mountain interface specifications (headset size, bottom bracket style, rear axle width and diameter, rear derailleur hanger) to accommodate both Free-ride and Dirt Jump components as necessary to handle the high speeds and harsh impacts associated with their use. Slope-style bikes are also used for light downhill or trail riding by many, if not riding jumps on the same scale as professional riders, with their durability and sophisticated suspension designs allowing for extra versatility when compared to Dirt Jump bikes. Mountain cross or \\"Four-cross\\" (4X) is a type of racing in which four bikers race downhill on a prepared, BMX style track. These bikes generally fall under the categories of Dirt Jump or Slope-style designs, with the main distinctions being the use of a derailleur rather than a single speed setup, or slightly slacker head angles than ordinary Dirt Jump bikes for increased stability at race speeds. Four-Cross racing has fallen in popularity recently, with the UCI removing Four-Cross from the World Cup due to excessive erosion and inconvenience caused by the purpose-built race tracks. (Four-Cross bikes mostly use derailleurs while Dirt Jumpers usually use single speed setups. Dual slalom (DS) is similar to Four- cross, but instead of four competing cyclists during a race, there are only two, racing in parallel lanes. The courses are in general more technical with smaller jumps than Four-cross courses. Dual Slalom races originally took place on grass slopes with gates and minimal jumps, but are now held on man-made courses. Dual slalom racers will usually use Dirt Jump, Slope-style, or Dirt Jump bikes. Indycross (IX) is essentially a Mountain Cross event featuring a wide variety of features run by one competitor per time. =Trials= Two varieties of trials bike exist, those with 26\\" wheels (referred to as 'stock') and those with 20\\" wheels (referred to as 'mod' because historically they were modified BMX bikes). They typically have no suspension at all, though some still make use of some form of it. Competition rules require stock bikes to have multiple gears for competition, but most riders never use their shifters. Competition rules do not require mod bikes to have any gears. Many non- competitive riders run single-speed, choosing a fairly low-speed, high-torque gear. Most modern trials bikes have no seat at all, as the rider spends all of his time out of the saddle, and trials riding is not conducive to the use of the saddle as a control interface as in normal mountain biking. These bikes are significantly lighter than almost all other mountain bikes, ranging from . This makes maneuvering the bike much easier. dirt jump bike. =Single- speed= The single gear ratio chosen depends on the terrain being ridden, the strength and skill of the rider, and the size of the bike (a bike with 29\\" wheels often requires a different gearing than a bike with 26\\" wheels). Often single-speeds are fully rigid, steel-framed bikes. These are typically ridden by very fit individuals on mild to moderate cross country terrain. Modern designs A 2002 rigid 21 speed Trek 800 Sport Gears Since the 1980s, mountain bikes have had anywhere from 7 to 27 speeds, with 1 to 3 chain-rings on the crankset and 4 to 12 sprockets in the cogset. 30-speed and 33-speed mountain bikes were found to be unworkable, as the mud-shedding capabilities of a 10-speed or 11-speed cassette, and the intricacies of a 10-speed or 11-speed rear derailleur were originally not found to be suitable combined with front shifters, although 10, 11 and 12 speed cassettes are now commonplace in single front chainring bicycles. However, many pro-level mountain bikers have taken to using a narrower 10-speed road chain with a 9-speed setup in an effort to reduce the weight of their bike. In early 2009, component group SRAM announced their release of their XX groupset, which uses a 2-speed front derailleur, and a 10-speed rear derailleur and cassette, similar to that of a road bike. Mud-shedding capabilities of their 10-speed XX cassette are made suitable for MTB use by extensive CNC machining of the cassette. Due to the time and cost involved in such a product, they were only aimed at top-end XC-racers. However, 10-speed has become the norm by 2011 and the market leader Shimano even offers its budget groupset \\"Alivio\\" in a 10-speed version. In July 2012, SRAM announced a 1x11 drivetrain called XX1 that does not make use of a front derailleur for lighter weight and simplicity. In the 2014 Commonwealth Games at Glasgow all leading riders used 1x11 drivetrains. SRAM's new 1x12 gearing was introduced in 2016 as SRAM Eagle. This gives a single chain ring bike better ability to climb. Sram Eagle 1x12 Drive Train Today in 2020, there are many different options for a mountain bikes gear set up. There are multiple companies that have hit the market with a dedicated mountain bike drive train. These companies are Shimano, Sram, Box Components, and many more. The big dogs in the industry are Shimano and Sram. Most Mountain bikes now a 1x11 or 1x12 drive train or gear ratios. Sram was first to introduce the 1x12 system in 2016 with their Sram Eagle system. Following behind them, in 2019 Shimano introduced their own 1x12 system called the M9000 series or 1x12 XTR system. These companies have even made specific drive trains for the different disciplines of mountain bikes. The main difference between the disciplines are weight, durability, and cost. Geometry The critical angles in bicycle geometry are the head angle (the angle of the head tube), and the seat tube angle (the angle of the seat tube). These angles are measured from the horizontal, and drastically affect the rider position and performance characteristics of the bicycle. Mountain bike geometry will often feature a seat tube angle around 73 degrees, with a head tube angle of anywhere from 60-73 degrees. The intended application of the bike affects its geometry very heavily. In general, steeper angles (closer to 90 degrees from the horizontal) are more efficient for pedaling up hills and make for sharper handling. Slacker angles (leaning farther from the vertical) are preferred for high speeds and downhill stability. Suspension A full suspension mountain bike In the past mountain bikes had a rigid frame and fork. In the early 1990s, the first mountain bikes with suspension forks were introduced. This made riding on rough terrain easier and less physically stressful. The first front suspension forks had about 1¬Ω to 2 inches (38 to 50 mm) of suspension travel. Once suspension was introduced, bikes with front suspension and rigid, non-suspended rear wheels, or \\"hardtails\\", became popular nearly overnight. While the hardtail design has the benefits of lower cost, less maintenance, and better pedaling efficiency, it is slowly losing popularity due to improvements in full suspension designs. Front fork suspensions are now available with of travel or more (see above under \\"Design.\\") Many new mountain bikes integrate a \\"full suspension\\" design known as Dual Suspension, meaning that both the front and rear wheel are fitted with a shock absorber in some form as the wheel attaches to the bike. This provides a smoother ride as the front and rear wheels can now travel up and down to absorb the force of obstacles striking the tires. Dual suspension bikes of a similar quality are considerably more expensive, but this price increase brings an enormous off-road performance upgrade as dual suspension bikes are much faster on downhill and technical/rough sections, than other forms of the mountain bike. This is because when the wheel strikes an obstacle its tendency is to bounce up. Due to some forward energy being lost in the upward movement some speed is lost. Dual Suspension bikes solve this problem by absorbing this upward force and transmit it into the shocks of the front and rear wheels, drastically decreasing the translation of forward momentum into useless upward movement. Disadvantages of rear suspension are increased weight, increased price, and with some designs, decreased pedaling efficiency, which is especially noticeable when cycling on roads and hard trails. At first, early rear suspension designs were overly heavy, and susceptible either to pedaling- induced bobbing or lockout. Disc brakes A front disc brake, mounted to the fork and hub Most new mountain bikes use disc brakes. They offer much improved stopping power (less lever pressure is required providing greater braking modulation) over rim brakes under all conditions especially adverse conditions, because they are located at the center of the wheel (on the wheel hub). They therefore remain drier and cleaner than wheel rims, which are more readily soiled or damaged. The disadvantage of disc brakes is their increased cost and often greater weight. Disc brakes do not allow heat to build up in the tires on long descents; instead, heat builds up in the rotor, which can become extremely hot. Wheel and tire design Typical features of a mountain bike are wide super tires. The original 26 inch wheel diameter with ~2.125\\" width (ISO 559 mm rim diameter) is increasingly being displaced by 29 inch wheels with ~2.35\\" width (ISO 622 mm rim diameter), as well as the 27.5 inch wheel diameter with ~2.25 widths (ISO 584 mm rim diameter). Mountain bikes with 24 inch wheels are also available, sometimes for dirt jumping, or as a junior bike. Bicycle wheel sizes are not precise measurements: a 29-inch mountain bike wheel with a bead seat diameter (the term, bead seat diameter (BSD), is used in the ETRTO tire and rim sizing system), and the average 29\\" mountain bike tire is (in ISO notation) 59-622 corresponds to an outside diameter of about 29.15 inches (740 mm). 622 mm wheels are standard on road bikes and are commonly known as 700C. In some countries, mainly in Continental Europe, 700C (622 mm) wheels are commonly called 28 inch wheels. 24 inch wheels are used for dirt jumping bikes and sometimes on freeride bikes, rear wheel only, as this makes the bike more maneuverable. 29 inch wheels were once used for only Cross Country purposes, but are now becoming more commonplace in other disciplines of mountain biking. A mountain bike with 29\\" wheels is often referred to as a 29er, and a bike with 27.5 inch wheels is called a 27.5 mountain bike or as a marketing term ‚Ä≥650B bike‚Ä≥. Wheels come in a variety of widths, ranging from standard rims suitable for use with tires in the 1.90 to 2.10 in (48 to 53 mm) size, to widths popular with freeride and downhill bicycles. Although heavier wheelsets are favored in the freeride and downhill disciplines, advances in wheel technology continually shave weight off strong wheels. This is highly advantageous as rolling weight greatly affects handling and control, which are very important to the technical nature of freeride and downhill riding. fat tire bicycle The widest wheel/tire widths, typically 3.8 in (97 mm) or larger, are sometimes used by icebikers who use their mountain bikes for winter-time riding in snowy conditions. Manufacturers produce bicycle tires with a wide variety of tread patterns to suit different needs. Among these styles are: slick street tires, street tires with a center ridge and outer tread, fully knobby, front-specific, rear-specific, and snow studded. Some tires can be specifically designed for use in certain weather (wet or dry) and terrain (hard, soft, muddy, etc.) conditions. Other tire designs attempt to be all-around applicable. Within the same intended application, more expensive tires tend to be lighter and have less rolling resistance. Sticky Rubber tires are now available for use on freeride and downhill bikes. While these tires wear down more quickly, they provide greater traction in all conditions, especially during cornering. Tires and rims are available in either tubed or tubeless designs, with tubeless tires recently (2004) gaining favor for their pinch flat resistance. Tires also come with tubes, tubeless and tubeless-ready. Tires with tubes are the standard design and the easiest to use and maintain. Tubeless tires often have better performance because you can run them at a lower tire pressure which results in better traction and increasing rolling resistance. Tubeless-ready tires are tires that can use tubes or go tubeless. A liquid sealant is used without the tube to secure the seal to the rim. Popular tire manufacturers include Wilderness Trail Bikes, Schwalbe, Maxxis, Nokian, Michelin, Continental, Tioga, Kenda, Hutchinson Specialized and Panaracer. Tandems A tandem, full-suspension mountain bike Mountain bikes are available in tandem configurations. For example, Cannondale and Santana Cycles offer ones without suspension, while Ellsworth, Nicolai, and Ventana manufacture tandems with full suspension. While these do exist, they are seen more as a joke and just for fun, than something designed for serious riding.

The population was 6,939 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Marion County. It is named for Francis Marion, a Brigadier General from South Carolina in the American Revolutionary War. History The Marion High School, Marion County Court House, Marion County Library, Marion County Museum and Marion Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some sixty years after the first permanent settlement in South Carolina, a group of English settlers sent out by the Lords Proprietor landed in Georgetown and moved up the Pee Dee River to the junction of the Little Pee Dee River about halfway between Georgetown and the present town of Marion. Among these families were Brittons, Davis, Flaglers, Giles, Graves and Tyler. At about the same time, and maybe on the same ship from England, came Captain John Godbold, a retired English sea captain. He moved farther up the Big Pee Dee and settled on Catfish Creek. The creek is southwest of and very near to the present city limits of Marion. During its early colonial years the area was part of Craven County. When Craven was divided, this segment of land was placed in Georgetown District and was known as Gilesboro after Col. Hugh Giles, American Revolutionary war hero who fought under Francis Marion. In 1785, another division was made and the name \\"Liberty\\" was used for a short time to designate this area. On December 17, 1847, when by an act of the South Carolina Legislature a charter was issued to the town, its official name was given as \\"Marion\\". The name honors General Francis Marion, a hero of the Revolutionary War. Court House A commission was appointed by the South Carolina Legislature to locate the site for a court house. Court was scheduled for the first Monday in March 1800. The court house was not complete, so it was held in a log building on Colonel Hugh Giles' plantation about two miles below Marion. The section was called Gilesboro or Gilesboro Court House for some time after. The Commissioners appointed to select the site for the Court House were offered land by several land owners in the vicinity, including Giles, but they chose and accepted four acres from Thomas Godbold, a grandson of Captain John Godbold. The present Court House was erected in 1854 and is the third Court House on or near the same site. During the Revolutionary War, the people of Marion County were divided in their loyalties. There were ardent Patriots under Col. Hugh Giles, Capt. John Dozier, Capt. Stephen Godbold and others. Maj. Micajah Ganey and Capt. Jessee Barfield led the Loyalists. Before the end of the war, most of the Loyalists had pledged allegiance to the colonists due to the activities of General Francis Marion in the area. The Revolutionary battles in the county were Port's Ferry, Blue Savannah and Bowling Green. During the American Civil War, Marion County was spared damage from Sherman's troops due to the Big Pee Dee River being at flood stage. The troops were unable to cross the river. The county fully participated in the reconstruction and in 1876 there were Red Shirt organizations in every township. Marion mascot is Swamp foxes. Railroad Marion County had several periods of growth. With the building and completion of the Wilmington to Manchester Railroad in 1854, business and transportation improved. Gen. W.W. Harllee was the first president of the railroad; the town of Florence, to the west of Marion, was named for his daughter. The second president was Col. William S.

History  The town was founded around the same time as Marion and Mullins, which was sometime after 1854 and was initially known as Floydsville. This was due to the land being on Harman Floyd's land that was sold off as town lots after his passing. These lots were surrounding depots for the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad. The town experienced a minor boom due to the turpentine industry, which shortly died out and was replaced by the tobacco industry. Later on, the town was renamed to its current title of Nichols, this time to honor Averett B. Nichols, who was a businessman that built a warehouse and store to take advantage of the tobacco boom and owned other stores in the town beside those of John H. Stroud and C. R. Ford. Following World War II, a popular employer was a local store focusing in furniture that went by the name Pilliod of Carolina. The town suffered severe flooding from Hurricane Matthew from the nearby Lumber River in 2016. Five months after the hurricane, 216 of the town's 261 homes remained vacant. Two of six churches remained closed, as were 15 of 22 businesses, the library, and most of the fire and police department resources.

As the county seat of Marlboro County, Bennettsville is noted for its historic homes and buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries -- including the Bennettsville Historic District which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. According to the 2010 census, Bennettsville has a population of 9,069. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (10.13%) is water. History The city of Bennettsville was founded in 1819 on the Great Pee Dee River and named after Thomas Bennett, Jr., then governor of South Carolina. The area was developed for short-staple cotton cultivation, dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans. Many were brought to the upland area from the Lowcountry, carrying their Gullah culture with them. Others were transported from the Upper South by slave traders. This shift to cotton cultivation in the uplands was based on the development of the cotton gin, which made short-staple cotton, cotton with relatively short fibers, profitable. The advent of the gin in turn led to development of large cotton plantations throughout the Deep South. In the same year, the S.C. General Assembly authorized the relocation of the courthouse from the eastern bank of the Great Pee Dee River to a more central location, selecting a apple orchard located on a bluff above Crooked Creek. The new courthouse was designed by South Carolina architect Robert Mills. Streets were developed radiating courthouse square, one of the state's largest. In 1852, the Mills building was replaced. In 1865 during the last year of the Civil War, the city was occupied by Union troops. During this time, the Jennings-Brown House and the first County Courthouse were used as the headquarters for General William T. Sherman. The new courthouse escaped burning. This is one of the few county seats that has preserved records dating to 1785; they are available for genealogical research. In 1884, another Second Empire-style courthouse was built on the site. In 1952-1954 it was later enlarged with additions, and the 1884 portion constitutes the central portion of the current building. Additions included two-story red brick wings and the present clock steeple, all designed by Bennettsville architect Henry D. Harrall. In 1885, Duncan Donald McColl financed development of the first railroad, bank and textile mills in Bennettsville, stimulating the economy as the town was connected to other markets and built an industry. The economy boomed during this \\"king cotton\\" era. The city became the center of one of the richest agricultural areas in the state. In the 20th century, the State of South Carolina designated Bennettsville as one its first \\"G.R.E.A.T. Town\\" (Governor's Rural Economic Achievement Trophy). Registered historic sites Buildings and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places include Appin, the Bennettsville Historic District, Jennings-Brown House, Magnolia, Robertson-Easterling-McLaurin House, and the nearby Welsh Neck-Long Bluff- Society Hill Historic District. The Bennettsville Historic District was designated and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Its contributing buildings include the Jennings-Brown House (1826), the Female Academy (1830), the Medical Museum (1902), and the Murchison School (1902), as well as other residences in the Queen Anne and Beaux Arts style. Facilities In the 21st century, a new Marlboro County library was constructed. Named in honor of national activist Marian Wright Edelman, who was born and grew up in Bennettsville, it opened on February 22, 2010. She founded the Children's Defense Fund, to promote programs for children and mothers. The library is located on at the intersection of Marlboro Street and Fayetteville Avenue adjacent to the Murchison building (1902) and is a new single-story building with approximately . Its front tower is oriented on axis with that of the Murchison Building. The building's cost was supported by $1.325 million in federal funding. The Library holds 60,000 volumes and has two conference rooms, seating 50 and 12. Economy The county is still largely rural, with limited job opportunities. The county seat serves as a trading center for the county. The Federal Correctional Institution, Bennettsville was built outside of the city in the county.

The population was 291 at the 2010 census. The town took its name from nearby Little Mountain. History The mountain is a monadnock, which is an isolated mountain or rock that has resisted the process of erosion and stands alone in an otherwise flat area. The Little Mountain Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Early history The mountain was referred to as Ruff's Mountain until sometime in the 1800s. It was part of Lexington County until 1917, when the current border was established. Property in this area was not recorded in the Newberry County tax records until some time in the 1920s. The Eastern side of the mountain was once owned by Sam Birge, and later Arthur Kohn. It would change hands between the two several times before coming into the possession of the Derrick family in the 1930s. The other side, including what became the town of Little Mountain, was owned by Abraham N. Boland. The Town Frederick H. Dominick was appointed as postmaster in May 1852. Abraham Noah Boland was appointed as postmaster of the Little Mountain Post Office in 1888. The town was founded around a railroad station in 1890: Boland's farm became the site of the depot when the C. N. & L Railroad (Columbia, Newberry, & Laurens Railroad Company) began operation. The town was incorporated and Boland became the first mayor of the town. Today, Boland is considered the \\"Father of Little Mountain.\\" Early residents were farmers of corn, cotton and grain. The town has become a bedroom community for Columbia, the state capital, 30 miles to the southeast. Education In 1892, a school was opened in a tenant house and taught by the pastor of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, Rev. S. L. Nease. Later a one-room school building was built on an acre of land donated by Noah Boland. Increased enrollment brought a two-room building and finally, in 1908 the plans were made to build the present Little Mountain Elementary School. Several additions and modifications have been made to the building since the original construction. Geography Little Mountain is located at (34.195161, -81.413946). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.1 square miles (2.7 km), all land. Little Mountain is located on Interstate 26 at Exit 85, which is approximately from the heart of downtown. Demographics According to the United State Census Bureau https://www.census.gov/popest in 2013 population in town was estimated to be 292 people and 142 households. The medium household income in the town is $56,250 with 2.9% of residents living below the poverty line. This compares to the South Carolina average medium household income of $44,779. Education of town residents is 93.8% with at least a high school degree compared to South Carolina's average of 84.5%.

Little Mountain Town Reunion Every year, the town of Little Mountain hosts the \\"Little Mountain Town Reunion\\" during the month of August. The Little Mountain Reunion is one of South Carolina‚Äôs oldest folk festivals. It began in 1882, as an effort by a person connected to Newberry College for encouraging local class reunions, the hope being that it would generate interest in the new college. The college experienced a number of set-backs since its organization; misused by Federal troops during the Civil War, moved to Walhalla in the upper part of South Carolina, and finally back to Newberry, the county seat of Newberry County. Because most people traveled either on two or four feet due to the lack of trains and automobiles, meeting places were selected mainly on the convenience of their location The Newberry Observer documents that in 1882 this group met first at Corinth Lutheran Church across the Saluda River. It was probably in the next year, or possibly the following year, that the officials decided to try the site at Little Mountain. The event was so successful that it was decided by those present that each year a Newberry College Reunion would be held at the foot of Little Mountain. The even took place on property recently purchased by A. N. Boland from Frederick Henry Dominick. He was quite agreeable to this plan and for many years prepared and sold barbecue, rice and hash, lemonade, and ice-cream to those who attended. For those who wished to bring along their own picnic, tables were erected between trees. Every year, people came riding in on horseback or in buggies, wagons, carts, etc. Then in 1890 when the first train came through Little Mountain, old-timers recall how more coaches were added at reunion time to bring people from Irmo, Ballentine, White Rock, Hilton, Chapin, Clinton, Goldville, Kinards, Prosperity, Newberry and Slighs A typical Little Mountain Reunion afforded not only a time to renew friendships made at school but the time to catch up on political thinking and the state of politics in the Dutch Fork. A welcoming address by the president of Newberry College made everyone feel at home and gave a pretty good idea of the state of the college. These reunions became a traditional part of the community, situated in the heart of the Dutch Fork area, and were eagerly anticipated by everybody in the area. The simple pleasures afforded here along with the community spirit helped maintain the reunion until the eve of World War II. In 1976, the Town of Little Mountain and the Ruritan Club decided to renew the reunion as a bicentennial project. The idea generated a great deal of enthusiasm in the town. The festival was such a success that the Little Mountain Association was formed and the Little Mountain Reunion again became an annual affair. The 2012 Reunion was cancelled, reportedly due to contract and liability issues between the Little Mountain Town Council and the Little Mountain Reunion Association. During the August 2013 Town Council meeting, the council voted to have the Little Mountain Reunion brought back starting August 2014. Mayor Jana Jayroe led the movement to solve the problems between the town and Little Mountain Reunion Association.

The population was 1,441 at the 2010 census. The town was named for George Fredrick Whitmire, who came from Stuttgart, Germany. History The earliest settler in what is now Whitmire was John Duncan, who built a house along the creek that now bears his name. The Whitmire family arrived in the 1850s and established a tavern and post office. The arrival of the Georgia, Carolina and Northern Railway in 1890 led to the town's rapid growth. Whitmire incorporated in 1891.Jennifer Revels, \\"Historical and Architectural Survey of Newberry County, South Carolina,\\" 2003, pp. 52-54. In 1905, William Coleman and several associates established a large textile factory known as the Glenn-Lowery Mill, which included 900 looms and 33,000 spindles. By 1911, the mill had nearly doubled in size. Later owners continued to expand the mill, and it would remain a major source of revenue for Whitmire throughout the 20th century. A fire in 1916 destroyed much of downtown Whitmire, which consisted primarily of wooden buildings. The town passed a series of new fire ordinances, and the business district was rebuilt with brick. Many of these buildings are still standing. In 1924, Whitmire attempted to \\"secede\\" from Newberry County and form a new county known as Carlisle County. The new county would have consisted of parts of Newberry County, Laurens County, and Union County, with Whitmire as the county seat.

Seneca was named for the nearby Cherokee town of Isunigu, known to the English as \\"Seneca Town\\".  History  Welcome sign Seneca was founded as Seneca City and named for a nearby Native American village and the Seneca River. The town was located at the intersection of the Blue Ridge Railroad and the newly built Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railroad. Both lines are now part of the Norfolk Southern Railway. A. W. Thompson and J. J. Norton, who were locating engineers for the Air Line Railroad, purchased the land from Col. Brown of Anderson, South Carolina. A stake marking the center of town was driven into the intersection of the railroad tracks and the current Townville Street. The land was divided into lots for one-half mile from the stake. An auction was held on August 14, 1873. The town was given a charter by the state legislature on March 14, 1874. In 1908, the name was changed to Seneca. Old Cotton Warehouse. The right hand section of the warehouse burned in April 2008 and has been torn down. Seneca developed as a marketing and shipping point for cotton. During the harvest, wagons bringing cotton would line up for blocks from the railroad station. A passenger terminal, several hotels, and a park were built near the railroad tracks. Recently, this park was named the Norton- Thompson Park in honor of its founders. The first school was built in 1874. The community was the home of the Seneca Institute - Seneca Junior College, which was an African-American school from 1899 to 1939. Westpoint Stevens Plant, January 2008. Demolition of the mill began in the spring of 2008. Textile mills came into the area with the construction of a plant-and-mill village by the Courtenay Manufacturing Company in Newry on the Little River in 1893. W.L. Jordon built another textile plant and mill village east of Seneca. This village has been called Jordania, Londsdale, and Utica as the ownership of the plant changed. The J. P. Stevens Plant, which was later called the Westpoint Stevens Plant, was a large integrated textile mill built on Lake Hartwell. Many other textile mills came to the area. These plants were the main industry for Seneca for the first half of the twentieth century. These textile mills are now closed. With the construction of Lake Hartwell in 1963, Lake Keowee in 1971, and Lake Jocassee in 1974, Seneca and the area saw dramatic changes. The Oconee Nuclear Station was built on Lake Keowee. The recreation provided by the lakes and other attractions such as nearby Clemson University brought many retirees from other parts of the country. Retirement communities have been built in the area.Louise Matheson Bell, Seneca: Visions of Yesterday, 2003, .Edgar, Walter, ed.

It is the county seat of Oconee County. The current mayor of Walhalla is Danny Edwards. History Named for Valhalla, the afterlife in Norse Mythology where warriors would go if selected to fight during Ragnar√∂k, Walhalla began as a settlement of German immigrants who left from Hamburg, Germany and Bavaria with some English, Scots and Irish who came over in the same ship. In particular, General John A. Wagener, Claus Bullwinkel, John C. Henckel, Jacob Schroder, and Christopher F. Seeba (trustees of the German Colonization Society of Charleston) bought of land for $27,000 from Reverend Joseph Grisham of West Union on December 24, 1849.

The population was 968 at the 2010 census, a decline from 1,198 in 2000. Geography Bowman is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History Interest in building a town at the intersection of present-day US 178 (Charleston Highway) and S.C. 210 (Branchville-Providence Roads) was evidenced in the acquisition of substantial properties of the Reddick A. Bowman estate by one Samuel W. Dibble, Sr. of Orangeburg, SC in 1887. The Smoak Tramway, a six-mile logging railroad extending from Branchville toward north Four Holes Swamp which was chartered in 1884, was also targeted for acquisition by Dibble's associate, Thomas M. Raysor, who operated the Raysor Mill near Stokes. These actions, aimed at developing and exploiting the agricultural and lumbering potential of an area that had remained rather dormant since the American Civil War, were taking place in the late 1880s. These represented the prelude to the chartering of the future Town of Bowman and the transportation and land development organizations and operations which preceded its chartering. The site chosen for Bowman was actually situated in the center of a rice farming country, later transformed into a major cotton-producing area where the land has a clay sub-soil, ideal for this and other crops. it was located on an old road that was traveled in colonial days by people going from Charleston to Orangeburg, and which was once alleged to have been known as Oak Ridge, a plateau about ten miles long and five miles wide. One of the oldest remaining operating companies located in Bowman, South Carolina, is V.P. Kiser Lumber Company, which now produces pine shingles. Some wood from Kiser Lumber Company was used to build Bowman's UFO Welcome Center. Tornado On the afternoon of December 5, 1977 a tornado, approaching from the west parallel to Highway 210, struck the downtown area. Three people were injured, the streets were littered with glass and debris, a few trailers were demolished, buildings were unroofed, and a power failure occurred. No people were killed. Post office Post office In the early years immediately prior to the founding of Bowman, mail service amounted to once or twice-a-week deliveries from Orangeburg by horse and buggy to outlying communities, such as Rileys, Connors and Ruples. The first post office in the Town of Bowman was located at Railroad Avenue and Ott Street (later Main Street) in the store of John W. Berry, a pioneer merchant, and he served as the first postmaster. The building also served as a residence, and it had the first telephone between Bowman and Branchville. The postal system of those early years in Bowman's history involved horse and buggy deliveries about twice a week from Orangeburg, and patrons from both town and surrounding areas had to pick up their mail from the post office until rural routes and carriers were organized to deliver mail outside the town limits in the early 1900s. Three rural routes were operational by 1907. The earliest carriers of record were W. H. Dukes, W. L. Bishop, O. P. Evans and Andrew Stroman, Sr. A fourth route was later added to serve the surrounding area, since reduced to three, and finally to the current two routes.

The town of Edisto Beach is in Colleton County, while the Charleston County part of the island is unincorporated. The island, town, and Edisto River are named after the historic Edistow people, a Native American sub-tribe of the Cusabo Indians, who inhabited the island as well as nearby mainland areas. History Indigenous peoples often had fishing camps on the islands, using them seasonally. The historic Edisto people are known to have occupied the island as well as mainland areas and traded with the upcountry Catawba. The sub-tribe became extinct during the colonial period. The Wassamasaw Tribe of Varnertown Indians is a group of descendants of various tribes who intermarried and who have occupied a settlement between Summerville and Moncks Corner in Berkeley County, South Carolina. In 2005 they gained state recognition as an Indian group, one of six tribes to do so.Bo Petersen, \\"Researchers explore local tribe's ties to legendary temple\\", The Post and Courier, 17 April 2005, accessed 14 December 2011Bo Petersen, \\"Local tribe reclaims its roots, heritage\\", 17 April 2005, accessed 14 December 2011 The first tracts of land, called plantations, were granted on Edisto Island before 1700. Landowners first harvested timber and deerskins, planted indigo and some rice, and kept herds of free-ranging cattle to produce hides for the European market and salt beef for Caribbean plantations. Cotton gradually became the principal crop, and after the American Revolution, Edisto Island planters became wealthy and famous from their production of long-staple Sea Island cotton. The labor done by hundreds of enslaved Africans who developed the creole Gullah language and culture on the islands and in the Lowcountry, distinctive for its African traditions. The 1790 census reported the island had a population of 223 Whites and 1,692 Black slaves. The 1860 census indicated 329 Whites and 5,082 slaves. Civil war Edisto Island was largely abandoned by planters in November 1861 and in December 1861, escaped slaves began setting up their own refugee camps there. In January 1862, armed blacks from the island and Confederate forces clashed and a Confederate raid in reprisal killed a number of unarmed blacks. In February, Union forces were stationed on the island to develop it as a staging area for future campaigns against Charleston, twenty-five miles away, as well as to protect the colony, which would eventually number thousands of blacks. As Union forces took control of the island, a number of skirmishes occurred, and Confederates withdrew. Pineberry Battery was further up the Edisto River from the island, which was one likely path for a land campaign against Charleston. In June, most of the Union troops left the island in a campaign, which culminated in the Battle of Secessionville. In July, the remaining troops withdrew, and the colony was removed to St. Helena Island. For the rest of the war, a small number of escaped slaves and plantation owners remained and farmed the island, but it was largely abandoned. Near the end of the war, the island was again used as a location of colonies of freed slaves.Tomblin 2009, p65-73, 85-86, 95 Historic preservation Since the twentieth century, the island has been redeveloped for use as a tourist destination and resorts, although some private plantations remain.

Interstate 95 connects its attractions easily with tourists traveling by automobile. I-95 crosses a narrow arm of the lake into the town lands, along a causeway. Lake Marion is a man-made hydroelectric reservoir, which at 110,000 acres (450 km2, 173 sq mi) is one of the fifty largest lakes in the country. The population was 961 at the 2010 census. The town has been undergoing economic and population growth, and development as rural niches are supplanted by bedroom communities. Construction of the Santee Cooper Regional Water System can provide millions of gallons of potable water per day to the surrounding five counties centered about Santee. The system was coordinated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, USEPA, and the South Carolina Department of Commerce. The plant was completed and operational as of 1 June 2008. Work to connect the plant to the five counties (Berkeley, Orangeburg, Dorchester, Calhoun, and Sumter) is underway and being overseen and funded by the same parties. Currently, the RWS serves the town of Santee, with pipeline rapidly being installed to other locations.

It is a principal city of the Greenville- Mauldin-Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area. Most of the city lies in Pickens County, with only a very small portion of the city in Anderson County. In 2001, Easley hosted the Big League World Series for the first time, and continued to host the tournament annually until it was disbanded in 2016. In 2017, the Senior League World Series moved to Easley as the host for the annual tournament. The Upper South Carolina State Fair is located in Easley and is held annually in early September. History Downtown Easley in early 1900s. In 1791 Washington District was established by the state legislature out of the former Cherokee territory. Rockville was also created in 1791 but changed to Pickensville in 1792. Pickensville became the district seat of Washington District which was then composed of Greenville and Pendleton Counties. In 1798 Washington District was divided into Greenville and Pendleton Districts. In 1828 Pendleton District was divided further with the upper portion becoming Anderson County and the lower becoming Pickens County named after Andrew Pickens. Col. Robert Elliott Holcombe became a co-founder of the town by starting off as a farmer and timber mill owner in the area. His farming ventures enabled him to establish the storeroom in 1845 as the first business in the area. The namesake of the town was William King Easley. Easley was born in Pickens County, South Carolina in 1825. Easley and four others from Greenville represented the Greenville area in the South Carolina Secession Convention. When the American Civil War erupted, Easley raised a company of cavalry from Greenville and Pickens counties. During the war Easley served as a major in the Confederate Army. After the civil war Easley became a local attorney and persuaded the Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railway to be established through Pickensville by raising $100,000 to invest in the railroad. Holcombe was considered to be the first citizen of Easley, building the first dwelling and train depot in the town from his family's lumber mill. Holcombe became the first mayor of the town and was also the first agent of the train depot. The town of Easley was chartered in 1873. At the time, the consensus was that it should be named Holcombe or Holcombetown, but Col. Holcombe said that he didn't think Holcombe was a very attractive name and that Easley sounded better. The Pickensville Post Office became Easley Post Office in 1875. The railroad transformed Easley into an industrious and thriving textile town. The Easley Textile Company, later known as Swirl Inc., came to Easley in 1953. The construction of U.S. Route 123 helped establish retail and new business to Easley. On April 25, 1951, a department store was on fire threatening many buildings in downtown Easley but the quick response of the fire department extinguished the fire. In 1968, NASCAR driver Curtis Turner caused a telephone outage in Easley while landing his airplane on the town's main street. https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/06/archives/curtis-m- turner-racing-driver-46-star-of-the-grand-circuit-dies-in.html Geography Easley is located in southeastern Pickens County at (34.823371, -82.590394), west of the center of Greenville.

Toponymy How exactly Liberty got its name has been a source of debate over the years. There are no real historical accounts of why Liberty was given the name it was. The most popular‚Äîthough probably mythical‚Äîstory regarding the reason the area was named Liberty was put forth by Mrs. Annie Craig in 1936: \\"At the close of the Revolutionary war a religious meeting was being held at a church close to a spring near the present town of Liberty when the word came that Cornwallis had surrendered and the colonies had gained their independence. This church was named Liberty and it and the spring were located just beyond where the cemetery is now located, hence the name Liberty.\\"Craig, Annie B. \\"Liberty.\\" Pickens County History (1936): Some have claimed that Liberty was once named Salubrity Springs, but was renamed Liberty in the late 19th century. References to early land records, however, suggests that such is not the case. While there are many records that refer to the area as Liberty Spring, there are no private or legal documents that contain a reference to Salubrity Spring.Woodson, Julia. Liberty, South Carolina: 1876-1976. Greenville, SC: A Press, 1992. 1. The first reference to Salubrity comes from the name of a farm purchased by the Rev. Allen Fuller, Universalist, in 1837. In 1839, Mr. Fuller set up a post office in his home, naming it Salubrity Post Office. This post office remained in operation until February, 1876, three years after the first official Liberty post office was established in 1873.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 118 Once the town of Liberty was chartered little more than a month after the Salubrity post office closed, the name Salubrity became little more than a memory. History=Early History (to 1890) Liberty today sits on land that was once part of the Cherokee Indians' hunting ground. The Otarre, or Lower Hill Cherokees, had several thriving villages along the riverbanks in the area; perhaps the most notable example being the village of Keowee, located near the modern day Oconee and Pickens County line. Cherokee tribesmen, who often survived by growing crops, and tended to live in small villages, were in many ways more domesticated than other Native American tribes. The Cherokee also hunted game, believing that the foothills were a sacred hunting ground for deer, buffalo, and other large animals.McFall, Pearl. It Happened in Pickens County. Pickens, SC: The Sentinel Press, 1989. 8-11. Tradition holds that Hernando DeSoto and his group of Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to travel through the area around year 1540.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 7. The first Englishmen to venture into the area were traders who often travelled up from Charles Town and Savannah to exchange their guns, horses, cloth, and liquor with the Cherokee for animal skin and fur.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 15. In 1753, British colonists built Fort Prince George, the first white settlement in Pickens County.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 21. During the American Revolution the Cherokee chose to support the loyalists. South Carolinian patriots, angered at the Cherokee for supporting the Redcoats, forced them to cede much of their territory with the Treaty of DeWitt's Corner in 1777.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 1. American settlers did not start moving into the area in large numbers until the mid-1780s. Much of the history of the Liberty area in the late 18th century is unknown. By 1800, Liberty‚Äîthen called Liberty Spring‚Äîwas included in the newly formed Pendleton District, which included most of modern-day Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens Counties. During the Antebellum period, most people living in Liberty Spring were subsistence farmers: farmers who grew only what they needed to survive. Few in the area could afford to own slaves like the wealthier planters in the Lowcountry, and almost every farmer was forced to work the land himself. Even for those who wished to trade with other towns, the poor roads made the effort to transport goods cost more than those goods were often worth. Outside of church, local residents had few opportunities to socialize with each other. By 1826, the Pendleton District had split up into Pickens and Anderson Districts, with Liberty becoming part of the new Pickens District, which included both Pickens and Oconee Counties. The Civil War and Reconstruction Era (1860-1877) In 1860, a group of Pickens County delegates went to Columbia, where they‚Äîalong with every other South Carolina delegate‚Äîvoted unanimously in favor of South Carolina's secession from the Union.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 70. Though it is generally accepted that the first shot of the Civil War occurred when the Union ship Star of the West was fired upon from state troops at Morris Island on January 9, 1861, an old legend claims that a local resident named William Mauldin fired upon the Union ship from Fort Moultrie a few hours earlier, making his the first shot of the War.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 73. Either way, what is known is that men from almost every family in the area enlisted to fight for the Confederate cause. Many families lost two, three, or more sons to the war effort. Several companies of infantry and cavalry were formed in Pickens District before being dispatched to serve under one of the state regiments. The men who either refused to enlist or deserted in battle were often thought upon with scorn by their neighbors for the rest of their lives, and even their descendants were often ostracized for years afterwards. The women who stayed behind willingly suffered through the whole war by doing without foods and supplies that were needed in the war effort.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 75. After the war, Pickens District, like the rest of the South, was placed under martial law by Union troops.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 81. With little choice in the matter, South Carolina was readmitted to the Union in 1868. Not long afterwards, Pickens District was separated into the modern day Pickens and Oconee Counties. Between 1865 and 1877, southerners had little control over their government. Gangs of Union troops sacked and looted many farms in Pickens County during this period, known as Reconstruction, and the county and state governments were largely controlled by Northerners who moved South after the war.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 82. Reconstruction officially ended in South Carolina around year 1877, not long after former Confederate General Wade Hampton III was elected governor under the Democratic ticket.McFall, Pearl. \\"It Happened in Pickens County,\\" 104. The Founders' Era (1876-1900) Liberty's official recognition as a town came soon after the Charlotte-Atlanta Airline Railway was completed in the early 1870s.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 2 Former Confederate General William Easley, a lawyer working for the railroad company, negotiated to have the tracks laid through the southern part of Pickens County. It is along these tracks that the towns of Liberty, Easley, and Central all grew. By 1873, Liberty Station was built north of Liberty Spring after Mrs. Catherine Templeton deeded her land to the railroad company. John T. Boggs set up the new Liberty Post Office that same year, and was named the town's first postmaster.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 3 Liberty was formally chartered on March 2, 1876, with the future town center being located on the former lands of Mrs. Templeton. In 1877, James Avenger was appointed the town's first marshall. The marshall, a forerunner to today's chief of police, was satired in a Pickens Sentinel article that claimed, \\"there was nothing for him to do, except to look after the cows that go astray.\\"Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 95 The town's first mayor W.E. Holcombe, a lawyer and former state senator, was elected in 1876.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 93 He, like every succeeding mayor until the early 20th century, conducted most municipal business in his own home. Several schools were already in operation by this time, with most being privately funded, and sponsored either by the community or by the local churches. The Liberty First Baptist Church had existed prior to the city's founding, being located at the old Liberty Spring site.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 19 Reports indicate the Church had a congregation as early as year 1802, when they met at an old log house north of the present-day town. The Liberty Presbyterian Church was built in 1883 at its present site; formerly the church's members had worshiped at Mt. Carmel Church in the country.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 22 The Textile Era (1900-1980) Liberty's next change came in 1901, when Mr. Jeptha P. Smith organized and started the first cotton mill, which he named the Liberty Mill. The original mill contained a card room and operating spinning frame. Eighteen houses and two overseer houses were built as a mill village to house the plant's workers and their families. The second cotton mill was built by Mr. Lang Clayton of Norris in 1905. Built in a part of town often referred to as Rabbit Town, the plant was originally named the Calumet Mill, and later renamed the Maplecroft Mill. By 1920, both mills had come under the control of Woodside Mills. The first mill became known as Woodside Liberty Plant #1 (commonly called the Big Mill), and the second as Woodside Liberty Plant #2 (commonly called the Little Mill). Woodside Mills operated the plants until 1956, when the company was purchased by Dan River Mills of Virginia. At their height in the 1970s, the mills employed over one thousand workers and housed over one thousand looms.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 67-68. In the 1970s, the Woodside Liberty Mills were the world's largest producers of oxford fabric, a popular fabric of the era. The mills were again purchased in the early 1980s by Greenwood Mills, which maintained control of the mills until local textile industry declined in the 1990s due largely to foreign competition. In 2013 the little mill was demolished. The Big Mill is currently being stripped for demolition. The growth of cotton mills in the area brought about a major shift in the way people lived. Many migrated away from farmlands to the mill villages, and went from growing food to survive to earning hourly wages in the mills. Though farming was a hard life, early mill life was grueling in its own right; mill workers‚Äîcondescendingly referred to as lintheads‚Äîoften worked twelve or more hours a day in unventilated rooms.Browning, Wilt. Linthead. Asheboro, NC: Down Home Press, 1991. A1. Nevertheless, most workers believed that they were fortunate just to have such work, and willingly worked in the same mills all their lives. In many mill village families, both the husband and wife worked in the same mill. Outside of the mills, several other major changes also happened during this long time period. Electricity came to Liberty in 1910, when Mr. J. Warren Smith, a salesman, installed two gasoline generators downtown to operate the first street lights and the lights of several shops. By 1928, demand had increased to the point that Mr. Smith decided to sell his assets to Duke Power, which established a small office downtown.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 90-91. The Liberty Fire Department was first established in 1925, with J. Warren Smith‚Äîthe same man who brought electricity to Liberty‚Äîbeing named as the first fire chief. The Fire Department moved into its present building in 1974.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 91. The first town library originated in 1947 as a small room located in the same building as City Hall. The Sarlin Community Library, the one in current use, was built at its present location in 1966.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 92. Liberty's police department was finally organized in the 1920s, when the city employed a chief of police and two policemen. The first telephone service came to Liberty in 1902, when Southern Bell installed a telephone switchboard in the same building as the post office. The first water plant for the town was built in 1918 on Black Snake Road. This plant initially supplied water to around one hundred homes. This plant was phased out by 1956 after a newer waterworks sight was built on Eighteen Mile Creek.Woodson, Julia. \\"Liberty.\\" 95-97. The former Mohawk Carpet plant is currently occupied by Southern Vinyl Windows & Doors, a major employer in the area. Geography Liberty is located at (34.788390, -82.694865).

Accessed 2008-11-06. It is the county seat of Pickens County. It was named after Andrew Pickens (1739‚Äì1817), an American revolutionary soldier and US Congressman for South Carolina. Pickens is part of the Greenville-Mauldin-Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Pickens is named after American Revolutionary War Brigadier General Andrew Pickens Present-day Pickens of Pickens County was previously Cherokee Territory. During the American Revolutionary War, the Cherokee sided with the Kingdom of Great Britain. When Great Britain was defeated in the war, the Cherokee were forced to surrender their land. In 1791, the state legislature established Washington District that comprises present-day Greenville, Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens County. In 1798 Washington District was divided into Greenville and Pendleton districts. The Pendleton district eventually became Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens County. Pendleton District was divided in 1828 into Anderson and Pickens. A courthouse was established on the banks of the Keowee River where the town of Pickens Court House was developed. The Hagood-Mauldin House was built circa 1856 and is one of the historic structures of Pickens County. In 1868, the Pickens District was divided for a final time, into Pickens and Oconee counties. Pickens Court House relocated to its present-day site and was renamed to Pickens. The Pickens Railway was established in 1898 as a shortline railroad from Easley to Pickens. From 1955 until 1987, Sangamo-Weston Inc. operated a capacitor manufacturing facility just outside Pickens. Until they were banned in the US, Sangamo discharged a significant amount of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into a tributary of the Twelve Mile River which feeds Lake Hartwell. Sangamo also dumped contaminated waste in six locations in the vicinity of Pickens. In two of these locations, the waste was burned, forming more dangerous dioxins. According to the Spartanburg Herald-Journal, contamination was discovered at the \\"Breazeale site\\", southwest of town. Schlumberger paid $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for injuries to natural resources caused by the contamination. Geography and climate Pickens is located at (34.881700, -82.707477).

Pickens also has several small mountains that surround the city. Glassy Mountain, located east of Pickens, is a small mountain that can be reached by several small private roads. Glassy Mountain is an excellent example of a piedmont monadnock, which are rare in South Carolina. Sixty-five acres of the mountain are part of the South Carolina Heritage Trust, and contain varied and rare plant species. Perhaps one of the most famous mountains in the area is Table Rock State Park, located just to the north of Pickens, but still in the Pickens area, which has been a symbol for Pickens and can be seen throughout Pickens and nearby cities such as Easley and Greenville.

The population was 8,219 at the 2010 census. Namesake The area became known as Boiling Springs because of a small spring in its heart that, up until the land was commercially developed, actually appeared as if it were boiling and would sometimes shoot water into the air. The geyser diminished gradually over the years. In the 1930s it had become a shallow, barely bubbling stream and today the water is still. The spring is located at the corner of McMillian Boulevard and Highway 9 on the same lot as the (formerly) Bi-Lo Shopping Center and the Verizon Mobile store. Once the land was developed and the shopping center was built, the springs ceased to boil. After the spring was cleaned up and dug out, a small park was built around it with benches, flags, and a memorial to a citizen of Boiling springs.

The creek is now called ‚ÄúJimmie‚Äôs Creek‚Äù. The early members traveled some distance to attend this church. They were from the communities of Cavins, Enoree, Crescent, Switzer and even others in Laurens County. Most of the early settlers had come from Virginia and North Carolina. They were primarily veterans of the Revolution and their families. Joseph Woodruff received a grant of 200 acres (which would later become Woodruff, S.C.). He came to this area from Yadkin River Valley in North Carolina after his service in the Revolution. The first census of Spartanburg District, in 1790, shows who his neighbors were. All of these people were farmers. There were a few country stores in those days, and these were supplied by ‚ÄúWagoner‚Äôs‚Äù. One of Joseph Woodruff's sons, Thomas, remained in this area and had dreamed of founding a town. But, he did not live to see Woodruff incorporated. His two sons, Dr. Charles Pinckney Woodruff and Captain A. B. Woodruff were most instrumental in carrying out their father's wishes. Therefore, the town was named in Thomas Woodruff's honor. There was no town nor industry until after the town was chartered in 1874. Men from the rural areas came into Woodruff to establish businesses and the town began to grow. The two Woodruff brothers worked vigorously to get the railroad to run through the town. The railroad was completed in 1885. This caused a rapid growth of business. The oldest standing home in Woodruff today is the home of Danny Verdin, located on Main Street. The house was built in the 1830s by Harrison Patillo Woodruff, son of Thomas. ‚ÄúSquire Jim‚Äù Westmoreland bought his home in 1874 when he came to Woodruff to establish a mercantile business. The home of Dr. Charles Pickney Woodruff stood where the Woodruff Post Office is now located. Capt. A. B. Woodruff's home was located on East Georgia Street. The site is now used as an overflow parking lot for the Lanford Funeral Home.[woodruff sc website] The Old Woodruff High School, First Presbyterian Church of Woodruff, and Hurricane Tavern are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 731 at the 2010 census, this was a decline from 1,001 in 2000. It is included in the Sumter, South Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The town was named for the Mayes family of early settlers after the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad cut through the Mayes' property and began as Mayes Station in 1852, replacing an earlier name of Bradleyville, South Carolina. Fortunes made in cotton and tobacco created wealthy landowners in this area of South Carolina. Mayesville served the local area as a place to process and sell these products and to obtain supplies. Merchants such as I.W. Bradley, Witherspoon Cooper and Isaac Strauss opened some of the earliest businesses in town. The town suffered greatly during the Civil War but thrived again for several decades beginning in about 1880. The patriarch of the Mayes family, Matthew Peterson Mayes II, known as \\"the Squire,\\" had been a merchant in Raleigh, North Carolina, was wounded in the War of 1812, and then turned to farming. Purchasing an existing plantation prior to 1819, he turned this small beginning into an empire that would survive the Civil War. He died in 1879 and was buried in the historic cemetery at Salem Black River Presbyterian Church. His great-great grandson James Edgar Mayes, known locally as ‚ÄúBubba Jim\\" presided over an 8,000-acre cotton plantation in Mayesville and served as president of the National Cotton Council before his death in 1994.

The population was 459 at the 2010 census.  History  Hemingway was created from a crossroads community named Lamberts in 1911 by Dr. W. C. Hemingway, in an effort to secure a depot for the proposed Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which was to run from Mullins to Andrews. Land owned by Dr. Hemingway was surveyed and the lots auctioned off. Subsequently, the railroad established a Hemingway depot, and the post office name was changed to Hemingway. With rail access, Hemingway grew into a market town for local agricultural products. Cotton declined after 1921, when the boll weevil arrived, but was already being replaced by flue-cured tobacco as the primary money crop for farmers. Other local products were naval stores from the pine forests (later replaced by timbering), corn, soybeans, wheat, and vegetables. Hemingway is near the Pee Dee River, which was the main commercial route for the area until the coming of the railroad. Snows Lake is near Hemingway. This is also a site in the Revolutionary War camp of US war hero General Francis Marion. The river was named by early explorers after the Pee Dee tribe.

The population was 3,328 at the 2010 census. History The original town was laid out as Williamsburg by the Lords Proprietors in colonial times, but a lone, unusually large white pine was found along the Black River. Since tall white pines were ideal for use as masts for ships, it was claimed by the Crown on behalf of the king. The broad arrow mark was carved into the tree to prevent any colonists from cutting it. Though white pines are native to the Appalachians as far south as Georgia, it is the only tree of King George‚Äôs ever found in the South. Over time, the county kept the name Williamsburg, but the county seat became known as the King's Tree, giving rise to its modern name. BattlesBattle of the Lower Bridge= General Francis Marion, known as the Swamp Fox, defeated the British at the Battle of the Lower Bridge in March 1781. A historical marker between US Highway 521 and the Black River denotes the battle. =Battle of King's Tree= After the British had captured Charles Town during the revolution, General Marion gained supporters from Major John James. The Battle of King's Tree took place on August 27, 1780. The city sustained losses, including Indiantown Presbyterian Church being burned to the ground. Historical homes and buildings The Kingstree Historic District, M.F. Heller House, Colonel John Gotea Pressley House, Scott House, and Thorntree are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Williamsburg Presbyterian Church= Williamsburg Presbyterian Church was founded in August 1736. The church consisted of three structures. Its founders built the first church in 1738 across from the Williamsburg Cemetery in town; the second building was constructed in 1828 and was across from the Williamsburg Cemetery as well. The third, the current structure of the church located on North Academy Street was built in 1914. The stained glass windows on the roof of the church today were imported from Austria. One of the stained glass windows on the roof was removed in 1989 during a renovation and was placed behind the pulpit of the sanctuary. The first person to be buried in the church cemetery was John Witherspoon(1670‚Äì1737), the father of James Witherspoon, builder of Thorntree. Williamsburg Presbyterian Church celebrated its 275th Birthday in October 2011. The church held a service to share Kingstree's history. The church is the oldest church that still exists today between the Santee and Cape Fear Rivers in North and South Carolina. Williamsburg Presbyterian is the mother church to 33 other Presbyterian churches. Two daughter churches include nearby Union Presbyterian church in Salters, South Carolina, and Indiantown Presbyterian Church in Williamsburg County. The Kingstree company formed at Williamsburg Presbyterian Church's original churchyard in July 1780. The company was led by Captain Henry Mouzon and later turned into the battalion and then formed a brigade led by Francis Marion against the British. =The Arnette House= The Arnette House is one of the three oldest homes in the town and was built in 1840. The home holds significance in the town because the dining room was used as a school for two periods of history during the early years of the home. =Thorntree House= Thorntree House is the oldest home in the lowcountry area of South Carolina. The early plantation home was constructed from native materials of South Carolina. James Witherspoon built the home in 1749 when the house was located six miles outside of town near where the Battle of the Lower Bridge took place. Witherspoon was a part of Francis Marion's brigade. After Witherspoon's death, Witherspoon's son inherited the plantation home. The British occupied the home during the revolution when it was at its original location, on the Black River. Gavin Witherspoon was the owner at the time. The house was later moved to its current location in 1969 when it was being restored by the Williamsburg Historical Society and is currently registered by the National Historic Register. The Williamsburg Historical Society moved the house into Kingstree city limits to provide protection by the city's police and fire department. =Williamsburg County Courthouse= The Williamsburg County Courthouse is located in the business district of Kingstree on Main Street. The original grounds of where the courthouse stands were the original parade grounds in the town of Kingstree and were used by the militia during the revolution. The courthouse was built in 1823 by Robert Mills, a nationally known architect that hailed from South Carolina.

As of 2010, the population was at 5,094 within the town limits. Clover is twinned with the Northern Irish town of Larne on County Antrim's East Coast.  History  Clover was founded just north of an earlier settlement, New Centre, which had waned during the Civil War. The pivotal American Revolutionary War battle of Kings Mountain occurred approximately eight miles to the west of modern-day Clover, on October 7, 1780. Prior to Clover's founding, Bethany and Bethel, communities to the west and east, respectively, were primary population centers in northern York District, with well-established Presbyterian churches, post offices and stores serving the area's numerous cotton farms. The village of Clover began as a railway stop in 1876, midway between Yorkville, and modern-day Gastonia, North Carolina, when the first railroad tracks were laid through the northern section of the county. Before the Civil War, the Kings Mountain Railroad had operated as far north as Yorkville from Chester, but the tracks were destroyed during the war. In 1873, the Chester and Lenoir Narrow Gauge Railroad was officially chartered and acquired the Kings Mountain rights of way. By 1875, new, narrow gauge railway replaced the remnants of the former Kings Mountain line, and the following year the tracks were extended from Yorkville to Gaston County, North Carolina. A water tank for the railway's steam locomotives was constructed midway between Gastonia and Yorkville. According to lore, the overflow of water from the railway's water tank fertilized a patch of clover, and the stop was called \\"the clover patch.\\" The town was officially incorporated in 1887. It later became the home of several cotton mills, many of which operated until after World War II.

The population was approximately 6,985 at the 2000 census and up to 7,736 at the 2010 census. York is located approximately southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina and west of Rock Hill, South Carolina.  History  The first European settlers came to York in the early 1750s, having migrated south from Pennsylvania and Virginia. Of the three major groups settling Pennsylvania, the English came first, then the Germans, and then the Scots. The county names of Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire had been brought from England to Pennsylvania, and then on to South Carolina by the early settlers. Prior to this, the first known inhabitants of York County were the Catawba Indians. The town of York was originally known as Fergus's Crossroads for a tavern, owned by two brothers, William and John Fergus, that was located at the intersection of the road from Rutherfordton to Camden and the road from Charlottesburg (Charlotte) to Augusta. When the county of York was established in 1785 the state statute required each county to erect a courthouse and public buildings in the most convenient part of the county, with a tax levied to cover the cost of \\"building the court houses, prisons, pillories, whipping posts and stocks.\\" Fergus's Crossroads was near the geographic center of the newly formed county and was chosen for the site of the new county seat. The town of Yorkville was established as the County seat in 1785. Situated between two Revolutionary battle sites, the Battle of Kings Mountain and the Battle of Williamson's Plantation, York was the only county in South Carolina to remain undefeated during that war. In 1823 there were 451 people living in Yorkville, 292 white and 159 black, with 80 houses in the town, eight stores, five taverns, one male academy and one female academy and a printing office. The town could boast 52 mechanics, eight lawyers, two physicians and one clergyman. Yorkville was officially incorporated on December 7, 1841. W.I. Clawson was the first mayor, and Stanhope Sadler, F.M. Galbraith, T.H. Simril and B. T. Wheeler were wardens. The population was about 800. Over the next two decades, before the outbreak of the American Civil War, Yorkville's population swelled to 2,000. In 1860 a gas works was installed on West Liberty Street, below the old county jail; Yorkville was the first town in the Upcountry with gas lighting. In 1853 Lewis Grist bought his father's newspaper and changed the name to the Yorkville Enquirer, which was published weekly until 2006, when it was merged with the Clover Herald to form the Enquirer- Herald, a weekly newspaper covering western York County. In 1915 the residents of the town voted to shorten its name to \\"York\\". Antebellum education Private academies operated on and off during Yorkville's early years. In 1854, the Yorkville Female Academy was established on East Jefferson Street. The next year, Micah Jenkins and Asbury Coward, young Citadel graduates, established the King's Mountain Military Academy. It was closed during the Civil War, during which Jenkins was killed, but Coward returned to Yorkville and reopened the school. The original buildings no longer stand, but it became the site of the Episcopal Church Home for Children, an orphanage located for many years in York, which is today a treatment center for emotionally disturbed children named York Place.  Historic structures  Allison Plantation, Hart House, Wilson House, Witherspoon-Hunter House, York County Courthouse, and York Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Rose Hotel was built in 1852, by Dr. E.A. Crenshaw and was referred to in the Lowcountry as one of the most palatial hotels in the Upcountry. Today it has been restored and completely renovated as apartments. The First Presbyterian Church was designed in 1846 by Robert Walker, a noted architect from Charleston, but construction wasn't begun until several years later and wasn't completed until after the Civil War. A gallery originally lined three sides of the sanctuary, part of it remains as a rear balcony, and the chancel originally featured a single uplifted pulpit that was converted in 1949 to a divided chancel and choir loft. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the American Presbyterian and Reformed Historical Sites. The present York County Courthouse was completed in 1914 and an annex was built in 1955, which completes the present structure, the fourth courthouse to occupy the site.

The population was 5,594 at the 2010 census. The city is near the geographic center of the 50 U.S. states. History Belle Fourche (French for \\"beautiful fork\\") was named by French explorers coming from New France, referring to the confluence of what is now known as the Belle Fourche and Redwater Rivers and the Hay Creek. Beaver trappers worked these rivers until the mid-19th century, and Belle Fourche became a well known fur trading rendezvous point. During and after the gold rush of 1876, farmers and ranchers alike settled in the fertile valleys, growing food for the miners and their work animals. At the same time, the open plains for hundred of miles in all directions were being filled by huge herds of Texas and Kansas cattle. Towns sprang up to serve the ever-changing needs of the farmers and ranchers. In 1884, the Marquis de Mores, a French nobleman and contemporary of Theodore Roosevelt, established a stagecoach line between Medora, North Dakota, and Deadwood, South Dakota. The Belle Fourche way station included a stage barn and a saloon. left Knowing the cattle barons and the railroad would need a point at which to load the herds of cattle onto freight cars for shipment to the packing plants in the Midwest, Seth Bullock provided a solution and became the parent, in effect, of Belle Fourche, the city. After serving in the Montana legislature in 1871‚Äì1873 (and being instrumental in the establishment of a National Park at Yellowstone), he had come to the Black Hills to cash in on selling supplies to the Deadwood miners, arriving August 2, 1876, the day Wild Bill Hickok was murdered. During the next 14 years, Bullock acquired land as homesteaders along the Belle Fourche River \\"proved up\\" and sold out. When the railroad came to the Hills and refused to pay the prices demanded by the nearby township of Minnesela, he was ready. Seth offered the railroad free right-of-way and offered to build the terminal if the railroad would locate it at a point on his land, near where the present Belle Fourche Livestock Exchange exists. In 1890, the first train load of cattle headed east. By 1895, Belle Fourche was shipping 2,500 carloads of cattle per month in the peak season, making it the world's largest livestock-shipping point. This was the start of the agriculture center of the Tri-State area for which Belle Fourche would become known. After winning a competition with Minnesela over the railroad which now goes through Belle Fourche, Bullock's town went on to win the county seat in the election of 1894. Still, cowboys rode into Minnesela and stole the county books. Belle Fourche today serves a large trade area of ranches and farms. The wool, cattle, and bentonite industries have been important to the growth of Belle Fourche. The city serves as gateway to the northern Black Hills.Information was taken from the Belle Fourche America's Hometown Booklet (1998) Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Geographic center of U.S. In 1959, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey officially designated a point 20 miles north of Belle Fourche as the geographic center of the United States. It is the center of the nation because the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the United States moved the location of the official center of the nation. The geographic center of the 48 contiguous U.S. states is Lebanon, Kansas.

The population was 1,230 at the 2010 census. The community is named after the Platte Creek, a tributary of the Missouri River reservoir Lake Francis Case. Platte is located 15 miles east of the lake. History Lewis and Clark were told to watch for ‚Äòburning bluffs‚Äô in the area. Settlement began in the early 1880s. A fur trader named Bernard Pratte once lived at the mouth of what was then known as the ‚ÄòFish Creek‚Äô. Pratte's last name was mistakenly transcribed as Platte on an early map of the creek and the spelling error stuck. The town that would become Platte was named after the creek. For 12 years, Charles Mix County was the only county in the state of South Dakota without a railroad. Platte originated in the summer of 1900 after it was selected as the terminus for a Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul railroad branch line from Yankton. The railroad arrived in October and buildings were moved from the nearby settlements of Castalia, Old Platte, and Edgerton. The Platte Enterprise newspaper was founded in 1900 and is still published today. The Great Depression and drought of the 1930s led to unemployment and out-migration in the area. A dam was constructed on the Platte Creek during this time. The area became a place for picnics and recreation. In 1956, the Fort Randall Dam was completed creating Lake Francis Case. In 1966, the Platte-Winner Bridge was completed over the lake giving travelers a new route to and from the Black Hills. Geography Platte is located at (43.386321, -98.842736).
