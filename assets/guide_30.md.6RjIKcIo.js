It was built for the Yugoslav Navy during the 1980s where it was named Soƒça. At the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence Soƒça was being overhauled in the Brodogradili≈°te specijalnih objekata division of Brodosplit shipyard in Split, Croatia. Although stripped of all equipment, it was preserved from the retreating Yugoslav forces by the shipyard workers. With modifications that were aimed at improving the ships endurance by including a diesel generator, it was launched as Velebit (P-01) in 1996. Since 2001, due to battery set malfunction, Velebit was no longer able to submerge, and was constrained to surface operations. After it was decommissioned in 2006, there were unsuccessful attempts of selling it to a foreign buyer. The submarine was then offered to various museums in Croatia, with a final destination still pending.  Design and construction  Velebit was completed as Soƒça in 1987 at the Brodogradili≈°te specijalnih objekata division of Brodosplit shipyard in Split, Croatia, as the fourth boat in its class. It measures in length, has a draft of , a beam and displaces when surfaced or when submerged. It was constructed as a single hull design with the internal compartment divided into three sections: forward (command/steering) position, exit chamber and the propulsion section in the back. During underwater operations two battery groups with a total of 256 cells power two 20 kW Konƒçar electric motors mounted on a single shaft that spins a five blade propeller. Surface propulsion and battery recharging is provided by a single diesel generator. Maximum speed is underwater and surfaced. The boat's range is with a speed of . It has an underwater endurance of up to 6‚Äì7 days which is an improvement compared to 96 hours of other Una-class boats. Maximum diving depth is . Because the class was designed with reconnaissance, small scale minelaying and special operations in mind, it does not possess any offensive weapons such as torpedoes. The submarine was to use its small dimensions to easily maneuver in the relatively shallow waters of the Adriatic Sea, staying undetected and transporting up to six special forces personnel who had 6‚Äì12 limpet mines and four AIM-M70 (M70/1) bottom mines or four R-1 submersibles at their disposal. Velebit had a crew of four.  Service  Before the Croatian War of Independence Velebit served with the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy entering service during the late 1980s. Velebit, then named Soƒça, was like other Una-class submarines, named after rivers in Yugoslavia. In 1991, it was being overhauled in Brodogradili≈°te specijalnih objekata until the beginning of the war, when Croatian forces captured it. In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthened by to create space needed for the installation of a single MTU 105 kW diesel generator, a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new steering system developed by BI was also installed. It was recommissioned as Velebit in 1996. According to the 2007 edition of The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, Velebit was fitted with a STN-Atlas Elektronik PP-10 active and PSU-1-2 passive sonar and a portable navigational radar may have been used on board along with the GPS. The claim is contradicted by other sources with news reports stating the submarine was completed without an active sonar, effectively being \\"blind\\" underwater. During the 1990s Velebit had the pennant number \\"3\\" painted on its side. Since 2001, after the existing battery set needed for underwater propulsion expired and needed replacement, crew training and boat operations were limited to surface drives.  Decommissioning and aftermath  The boat's name on the port side of the hull In February 2005 Velebit was raised from the sea, placed on a small platform within the Lora Naval Base and has remained there since. In June 2006 the Croatian Ministry of Defence released the Croatian Armed Forces Long Term Development Plan 2006‚Äì2015 () in which it was stated that: Velebit photographed in the Lora Naval Base in August 2011 The defence minister at the time, Berislav Ronƒçeviƒá, explained that because Croatia was to join NATO in the spring 2008, it would be a part of the collective defense of the entire alliance, and the need to develop all aspects of the defence system, including a submarine force, would be unnecessary. In 2007 it was confirmed that the submarine was put up for sale through the state-owned \\"Alan Agency\\" that deals with weapons sales, with a starting price of 8 million Croatian kunas (approximately 1.07 million Euros). Acting commander of the Croatian Navy at the time, Ante Urliƒá, among other propositions, mentioned the possibility of installing a new set of batteries, sonar and overhauling the submarine. Fully operational, Velebit would then be sold for a much higher price of around 15 million euros. Considering the potential overhaul and sale didn't happen, a decision was made to donate the submarine to a museum. In 2009 it appeared that the submarine would be given to the Technical Museum in Zagreb under an agreement between mayor Milan Bandiƒá and the government agencies, but this project was canceled due to the difficulty of transporting the tall submarine through the city center to the museum. The Croatian Maritime Museum in Split also expressed interest in obtaining Velebit as a part of its display, especially considering it was built in Split and homeported in the city throughout its service career. The main obstacle to this option is that the Maritime Museum is located in the Gripe fortress; because the plans for moving the Maritime Museum to the more spacious port of Split have been put on hold, a new option that includes moving Velebit to the Military Museum that's being created in Zagreb, has also appeared. As of 2018, the final location has yet to be decided.

Naturally, the terminology evolved. Argument An argument, more fully a premise‚Äìconclusion argument, is a two-part system composed of premises and conclusion. An argument is valid if and only if its conclusion is a consequence of its premises. Every premise set has infinitely many consequences each giving rise to a valid argument. Some consequences are obviously so, but most are not: most are hidden consequences. Most valid arguments are not yet known to be valid. To determine validity in non-obvious cases deductive reasoning is required. There is no deductive reasoning in an argument per se; such must come from the outside. Every argument's conclusion is a premise of other arguments. The word constituent may be used for either a premise or conclusion. In the context of this article and in most classical contexts, all candidates for consideration as argument constituents fall under the category of truth-bearer: propositions, statements, sentences, judgments, etc. Deduction A deduction is a three-part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates ‚Äì steps of reasoning showing that its conclusion is a consequence of its premises. The reasoning in a deduction is by definition cogent. Such reasoning itself, or the chain of intermediates representing it, has also been called an argument, more fully a deductive argument. In many cases, an argument can be known to be valid by means of a deduction of its conclusion from its premises but non-deductive methods such as Venn diagrams and other graphic procedures have been proposed. Proof A proof is a deduction whose premises are known truths. A proof of the Pythagorean theorem is a deduction that might use several premises ‚Äì axioms, postulates, and definitions ‚Äì and contain dozens of intermediate steps. As Alfred Tarski famously emphasized in accord with Aristotle, truths can be known by proof but proofs presuppose truths not known by proof. Comparison Premise-conclusion arguments do not require or produce either knowledge of validity or knowledge of truth. Premise sets may be chosen arbitrarily and conclusions may be chosen arbitrarily. Deductions require knowing how to reason but they do not require knowledge of truth of their premises. Deductions produce knowledge of the validity of arguments but ordinarily they do not produce knowledge of the truth of their conclusions. Proofs require knowledge of the truth of their premises, they require knowledge of deductive reasoning, and they produce knowledge of their conclusions. Context Modern logicians disagree concerning the nature of argument constituents. Quine devotes the first chapter of Philosophy of Logic to this issue.Willard Quine, Philosophy of logic, Harvard, 1970/1986. Historians have not even been able to agree on what Aristotle took as constituents. John Corcoran, Aristotle's syllogistic premises. Bulletin of Symbolic Logic. 18 (2012) 300‚Äì1. Argument‚Äìdeduction‚Äìproof distinctions are inseparable from what have been called the consequence‚Äìdeducibility distinction and the truth-and-consequence conception of proof. Variations among argument‚Äìdeduction‚Äìproof distinctions are not all terminological. Logician Alonzo Church never used the word argument in the above sense and had no synonym. Church never explained that deduction is the process of producing knowledge of consequence and it never used the common noun deduction for an application of the deduction process. His primary focus in discussing proof was \\"conviction\\" produced by generation of chains of logical truths ‚Äì not the much more widely applicable and more familiar general process of demonstration as found in pre-Aristotelian geometry and discussed by Aristotle. He did discuss deductions in the above sense but not by that name: he called them awkwardly ‚Äúproofs from premises‚Äù ‚Äì an expression he coined for the purpose. The absence of argument‚Äìdeduction‚Äìproof distinctions is entirely consonant with Church's avowed Platonistic logicism. Following Dummett's insightful remarks about Frege, which ‚Äì mutatis mutandis ‚Äì apply even more to Church, it might be possible to explain the today-surprising absence.

Such plants commonly include heathers (Erica, Calluna and more) and Rhododendrons. Another group of plants common in ericaceous beds are those belonging to the boreal coniferous forest, e.g. Vacciniums. A number of orchids also grow well in nutrient-poor soil. Ericaceous fertilizer can be applied for plants that require acidic, but not nutrient-poor, soil. Botanically, plants with ericoid mycorrhizas grow successfully on mor-humus soils in which low pH and high organic acid levels combine to exclude many other species.

The city has a rich Jewish history, but the Jewish community has also seen tensions and faced anti-Jewish backlash. Today, the Jewish community is quite established and has a number of community organizations and institutions.  Background information  Temple Beth El in Bloomfield Township As of 2012, about 116,000 Jewish Americans live in Metro Detroit. In 2001, about 96,000 Jewish Americans lived in Metro Detroit. That year, 75% of them lived in Oakland County. Many are in walking distances to their synagogues.Woodford, p. 188. The Jewish community includes Ashkenazi, Hasidic, and Sephardic origin Jews who follow those traditions. The religious movements represented include common versions of Conservative, Orthodox, Reform Judaism.Stiefel, p. 8. The nearby cities of Ann Arbor, Flint, Lansing, and Ypsilanti have their own Jewish communities. Barry Stiefel, author of The Jewish Community of Metro Detroit 1945-2005, classifies these cities as being part of the \\"Greater Metro Detroit\\" region. History 1902‚Äì1922 Temple Beth-El, now the Bonstelle Theatre  The First Jew In Detroit (1762-1783)  The first recorded Jew in Detroit was Chapman Abraham, a fur trader from Montreal. In 1762, in order to trade he traveled south along the Detroit River. He was recorded that year. Until his 1783 death he had a residence in Detroit.Cohen, p. 7.  Detroit's First Jewish Neighborhood (1880‚Äì1930)  German and Central European Jews found their homes in the Hasting Street Area neighborhood around 1880. Here, the professions of the middle class included proprietors, managers, and white collar workers. However, much of the elite were involved in politics. Some served in elected positions at the city and state level in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But, after 1930, no Jew served on Detroit's elected Common Council until 1962. = Prohibition Era (1920‚Äì1930) = In the 1920s and early 1930s, during the Prohibition Era, the Jewish Purple Gang operated alcohol smuggling and committed acts of violence in Detroit. By the early 1930s the gang had been weakened and organized crime groups from the East Coast wrested control of the territory from the Purple Gang.Gribben, Mark. \\"Bootlegger's Paradise.\\" (Archive) The Purple Gang. Crime Library. Retrieved on December 14, 2013.  Eastern European Arrivals (1900‚Äì1940)  Demographics = Eastern European Jews arrived in Metropolitan Detroit in the 20th century. The German Jews left the Hastings Street neighborhood for the areas to the North and West of it. Such areas included east of Woodward Avenue near Warren and Oakland Avenues. In the 1930s several Jews leaving Germany under Adolf Hitler arrived in Detroit. In the 1940s the 12th Street/Linwood/Dexter area housed the Jewish community in Detroit. The community at one point moved to the Livernois-Seven Mile area. It later relocated to the Oakland County municipalities of Oak Park, Southfield, and West Bloomfield. The post-World War II Jewish community began to suburbanize. Barry Stiefel, author of The Jewish Community of Metro Detroit 1945-2005, wrote that \\"The move from Detroit to the suburbs north of Eight Mile Road was not a Jewish event, but one of socioeconomic class and race.\\" According to historian Lila Corwin Berman, Although not as populated as the Lower East Side, Jewish Hastings Street still struck reports as overcrowded and teeming with foreignness and a \\"queer\\" Yiddish dialect.\\" The Michigan census in 1935 stated,\\" 10% of Jews lived in the Hastings Street area and 80% of the Jewish population lived in two Neighborhoods. The Twelfth Street area and the neighborhood referred to as Dexter.\\"Meyer, Henry J. \\"The Economic Structure of the Jewish Community in Detroit\\". Jewish Social Studies. Volume 2, No.2 (April.,1940). The local elementary school was the most populous in the city and had a predominantly Jewish student body. Synagogues and kosher markets lined the streets in this area of the city. The Dexter/Davison Market was where Jews came to show and to pause in their errands for conversations and to catch up with one another. = Economy = According to Meyer, Income of Jewish workers likewise varies between industries. An income of $2,000 more was received in 1934 by 33 percent of the Jewish workers who engaged in professional service, whereas the income was received by only 5 percent of the workers in domestic and personal service industries and 6 percent of the Jewish workers in automobile factors. By 1935, The Working force was considered to be 34,459 people. The white collar occupation groups around that time included professional workers, proprietors, managers and officials, and clears and kindred workers. By 1937, 71,000 Jews lived in Detroit which made it the sixth most populated Jewish city in the United States.  Tension (1936‚Äì1970)  Jewish Community Council = The Jewish Community Council was a centralized Jewish organization founded in 1936. The aim of the organization was to coordinate Jewish activity with relations with non-Jews throughout the city. In the late 1930s, they turned its attention to the tension brewing in the Hastings Street area in the late 1930s. = Jewish and African American Conflict = According to Berman, \\"In the fall of 1937, the rabbi of Temple Beth El, the city's largest Reform temple, chastised Jewish merchants in the Hastings street area for behaving unethically towards black customers. She also stated,\\" Black Jewish conflict fared between 1938 and 1941, especially along Hastings Street where youths assaulted merchants and their stores.\\" However, there were some African Americans who considered Jews their allies. According to Capeci,\\" Prominent Jewish Detroit's had supported the Urban League, genuinely but paternalistically concerned more with improving the welfare of black than raising their status.\\" Capeci. \\"Black-Jewish Relations in Wartime Detroit: The Marsh, Loving, Wolf Surveys and the Race Riot of 1943\\". Jewish Social Studies. 47, Nov. 3/4 (Summer-Autumn, 1985). Following the Detroit race riot of 1943, Detroit Mayor Edward Jeffries decided to appoint a Jewish woman to his newly-established Inter-Racial Committee, and named Mrs. Golda Krolik, who served on this committee until 1968. = 1940s = In the 1940s, Jews in Detroit were involved in their neighborhood's policies. They were concerned with who was living where, who was moving, and why. In the fall of 1947, the Jewish Community Council joined forced with the Interracial Committee of the NAACP to create the Midtown Neighborhood Council. = Late 1960s and 1970s = In the late 1960s and 1970s, there were progressive democratic ideologies in Detroit. There were radical political ideas from the left, the right, and the black separatist groups. In 1963 Rabbi Sherwin Wine, located in Metro Detroit, founded the Humanistic Judaism movementSteifel, p. 7. In 1966, Rabbi Morris Adler of Congregation Shaarey Zedek was shot while leading a service on the bima, and later succumbed to his wounds.  The Rise of the Suburbs (1950‚Äì1958)  In the 1950s Jewish settlement patterns changed from the northwest suburb of Detroit into Jewish spaces. In 1958, one-fifth of all Detroit Jews lived in Oak Park and Huntington Woods. But, some left for the suburbs with a sense of defeat. According to Berman, \\"Most, however, expressed optimism that the suburbs would become a newer, better location for American and Jewish life than the city had been. Suburban planning commissions, driven by the building industry and federal incentives for home building in the suburbs, helped create the landscape of optimism.\\"  The Later Suburban Neighborhoods (1970‚Äì1988)  Bernard Ginsburg House Stiefel wrote that by the 1970s the exodus of Jews from the City of Detroit to the suburbs had increased from a \\"trickle\\" to a \\"deluge.\\" There were 80,000 Jews living in Metro Detroit in 1976, of a total population of 4,138,800, and in the metro area there were 34 congregations: 23 Orthodox, 6 Conservative, 4 Reform, and one Humanistic. In the 1980s the Metro Detroit Jewish community lived in several municipalities. Barry Steifel, author of The Jewish Community of Metro Detroit 1945-2005, wrote that in the 1980s \\"the new, collective foci of the Jewish community\\" were several municipalities in Oakland County and western Wayne County which housed \\"massive congregations\\".Steifel, p. 7-8. Stiefel wrote that it was by then \\"nonexistent\\" in the City of Detroit. Suburban municipalities defined by Stiefel as foci included Bloomfield Hills, Farmington Hills, Oak Park, Royal Oak, Southfield, and West Bloomfield. Smaller congregations of Jewish people existed in other municipalities such as Livonia and Trenton. In the 1980s many Russian Jews arrived in Metro Detroit because of the Soviet Union's 1988 relaxation of travel restrictions and the processes of its dissolution. Oak Park received most of these Russian Jews. The Metro Detroit Jewish community helped thousands of these Soviet Jews travel to Michigan.

The German Jews, who predominately lived north of Downtown Detroit, usually worshiped at Reform Temple Beth El. Russian and Eastern European Jews tended to worship at lower east side Jewish district Orthodox synagogues.Babson, p. 28. In Delray the First Hebrew Congregation of Delray or the Orthodox Hungarian Jewish Congregation was located on Burdeno, near Fort Wayne. It was operated by Hungarian Jews and it was Detroit's first Orthodox Judaism synagogue that was west of Woodward Avenue.Cohen, p. 64. Media The Detroit Jewish News serves the Jewish community in Metro Detroit. In 1951 there were Jewish community newspapers in Detroit in the English and Yiddish languages. Two English-language newspapers, The Jewish News and the Jewish Chronicle, were weekly.

The possible mismanagement of the school's finances and the subsequent reactions of students, faculty, alumni and organized protest groups attracted widespread media attention. Activist groups staged a series of occupations and protests demanding the resignation of the school president, Jamshed Bharucha, promoting a vote of no confidence in Bharucha and the school's Board Chair, Mark Epstein, both of whom resigned in 2015, and insisting that the administration address the concerns of students, faculty, alumni, and the public, and alternate plans to avoid having the school charging tuition. Chairman of the Board Mark Epstein walks out of a closed-door board meeting in December 2012. Students hold Saran Wrap representing their demand for more transparency in the board's past and future actions. It has been reported that the Cooper Union financial crisis was due to a combination of problems caused by poor fiscal decisions, lack of accountability, the economic recession of the late 2000s, the selling off of the institution's assets, and taking on significant debt due to the 2009 building of 41 Cooper Square, which cost the school . In fiscal year 2009 ending in June, Cooper Union's managed assets (including investments in hedge funds) lost 14%, and the value of its endowment in 2013 was lower than it was at the end of fiscal year 2008, even as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit new highs. The new Cooper Union Academic Building, completed in 2009, is located at 41 Cooper Square, designed by architect Thom Mayne of Morphosis, and is the newest addition to the campus. Located on the northwest corner of the Cooper Union Foundation Building at 7 E 7th Street, this plaque is a historical landmark that notes that Cooper Union provides \\"free education to all\\" Cooper Union assessed tuition for the freshman class of 2014, with plans for tuition for future students. The New York State Attorney General reached an agreement in September 2015 to settle a lawsuit filed by the Committee to Save Cooper Union against the Board of Trustees. A consent decree, signed by the Attorney General and both parties in the lawsuit and pending court approval, outlined additional fiscal and administrative oversight of the school by the Attorney General and made provisions for students, alumni, and faculty, who would work with the Board of Trustees to determine how Cooper Union could return to a tuition-free school. Timeline=2011 * October: The Cooper Union administration deletes mention of the full-scholarship and history of free education from the school's website. * October 18: The inauguration of president Jamshed Bharucha takes place, and the literature provided during the main ceremony lacked any mention of \\"free\\" or \\"full-scholarship\\" in its full history and descriptions of the school. The various speeches also omitted these words, while focusing on other words, such as \\"global\\" and \\"growth\\". * October 29: News circulates that the school is in serious financial trouble and the administration indicated that depletion of the school's endowment required additional sources of funding. * October 31: The Cooper Union administration announces to the public, to the New York Times, and at a student forum that its available funds were vastly depleted. Bharucha announced that the school's annual deficit was around . * October 31: A series of open forums are held with students, faculty, and alumni to address the crisis. In these forums, the administration proposed a possible tuition levy, more focused solicitation of alumni donations, and research grants were all being considered to offset recent financial practices, such as liquidating assets and spending heavily on a controversial new academic building. *November 2: Bharucha announces a \\"Reinvention\\" plan. Walkouts and various protests begin. 2012 *March: Facing the threat of closure, the Cooper Union Art Faculty submits a Reinvention proposal. *April: The college announces that it would start charging tuition for Graduate Students in the Fall of 2014. *April 16: Cooper Union students satirize college administration in the press. *April 26: Two Cooper Union students are arrested during a tuition protest outside the Foundation Building. * December 2012: As a protest against the possibility of undergraduate tuition being charged, 11 students occupy a suite in the Foundation Building for a week. During the occupation, a protest rally to Washington Square Park and outside the Cooper Union took place. 2013 * April 23: The New York Times reports that the college has announced that it would end its free tuition policy for undergraduates effective Fall 2014, and charge an estimated each year. The administration maintains that they would continue to offer need-based tuition remission to incoming undergraduates on a \\"sliding scale\\". Cooper Union announces that its Board of Trustees would attempt to establish a new tuition-based cross- disciplinary graduate program, expand its fee-based continuing education programs, and charge tuition to some students in its existing graduate programs, effective September 2013. *May: Students present a Vote of No Confidence document to President Bharucha's Office. * May 8: A group of students and members of the public occupy Bharucha's office. *June: Students organize a sit-in in the presidential office after presenting the Vote of No Confidence document. The sit-in turns into an occupation. *July: The student occupation ends in an agreement negotiated with trustees Michael Borkowsky and Jeff Gural. A working group, composed of trustees, faculty, alumni and students was tasked with preparing an alternative to charging tuition. 2013 street art at Cooper Square by English artist Banksy, transformed by anonymous artist into triptych protesting tuition at Cooper Union *August: Cooper Union Vice President of Finance, T. C. Westcott and Dean of Students Linda Lemiez resign. *September: The Free Cooper Union group hosts a \\"Freshmen Disorientation\\" to inform incoming students about its views on the recent financial crisis. * October 12: During his month-long Better Out Than In \\"residency on the streets of New York\\", British artist Banksy paints \\"Concrete Confessional\\" in a pre-cast concrete structure stored near the entrance of 41 Cooper Square. Overnight, the piece is \\"transformed by an anonymous, unauthorized collaborator into a visual statement of opposition to the administration\\" of Cooper Union, by the addition of a Peter Cooper-style beard to the priest, and a portrait of a penitent Jamshed Bharucha, the Cooper Union President, in the structure adjacent to the Banksy piece. \\"Free Cooper: The Musical\\" was added to a third structure, a homage to another work in Banksy's October series. * November Administrators show members of the student government a draft of the school's new code of conduct, which, aside from addressing fire safety and drug use, would forbid \\"deliberate or knowing disruption of the free flow of pedestrian traffic on Cooper Union premises\\" and \\"behavior that disturbs the peace, academic study or sleep of others on or off campus\\". A section on bullying notes communication, in any medium, that \\"disrupts or interferes with the orderly operation of the Cooper Union\\". * December During the trustees' meeting to review the working group proposal, newly elected chairman, Richard Lincer, said the board must ‚Äúgive the proposals contained in the report the serious and rigorous review and analysis that they warrant‚Äù, and that they would meet again the following month for a final decision. 2014 * January 7: With the tuition decision looming, former trustee Michael Borkowsky, who was one of the trustees who brokered the deal with the students to end occupation, urged the trustees to consider the risks of the tuition plan, which he holds are greater than the risks of the working group plan. * January 11: After taking an additional month to review the working group plan, the trustees noted that \\"the Working Group plan puts forward a number of recommendations that are worth pursuing under any financial model. However, we believe that the contingencies and risks inherent in the proposals are too great to supplant the need for new revenue sources. Regrettably, tuition remains the only realistic source of new revenue in the near future\\". Trustee Jeff Gural also proposed a plan in which he would make a large donation to offset the revenue lost from not charging tuition for a year, keeping the school tuition free for another year. This plan was also rejected by the Board. * May 27: The Committee to Save Cooper Union files a lawsuit In New York Supreme Court to block Cooper Union from charging tuition and petitions the court for formation of ‚ÄúThe Associates of Cooper Union‚Äù, as required by the Cooper Union charter. The Associates would serve as a check on the Board of Trustees since the Associates‚Äô elected Council could remove Trustees by majority vote. They petition the court for an audit to review the history of fiscal transactions, including any potential mismanagement, by the Cooper Union administration. The Committee also launches an IndieGogo campaign to raise for its legal battle against Cooper Union. * May 28: At an outdoor press conference at Cooper Union, leaders of The Committee to Save Cooper Union and Richard Emery, its legal representative from Emery, Celli, Brinckerhoff, & Abady, outline grievances, including their claims of fiscal mismanagement, against the Cooper Union administration, and the May 27 lawsuit for an injunction to prevent Cooper Union from charging tuition. Also, Cooper Union alumni and student members of Free Cooper Union stage protests outside of Cooper Union. Students show their support at their graduation ceremony at Cooper Union by wearing \\"Save Cooper Union\\" signs on their caps. 2015 * March 25: The Wall Street Journal reported that Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, had informed Cooper Union's current and past board members that his office would be investigating the school's handling of its financial portfolio ‚Äì which includes the land on which the Chrysler Building stands ‚Äì which may have led to the financial crisis which caused the institution to begin charging tuition to undergraduates for the first time.Vilensky, Mike. \\"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman Is Investigating Cooper Union\\" The Wall Street Journal (March 24, 2015) In The New York Times, James B. Stewart saw the move as an indication that the state would no longer take a laissez-faire attitude toward non-profit organizations, and would look into possible malfeasance before such institutions failed; with a most recently reported endowment of , Cooper Union is in no danger of imminent failure.Stewart, James B. \\"Cooper Union Inquiry Puts Nonprofits on Notice\\" The New York Times (April 9, 2015) The focus of the investigation is said to be the board's relationship with Tishman Speyer Properties, which manages the Chrysler Building, and a loan the school received from MetLife, for which the board used the land beneath the Chrysler Building as collateral. In addition, a bonus approved for former President George Campbell Jr. would be under scrutiny. * June 11: Cooper Union President Jamshed Bharucha announced that he would be resigning at the end of the month. His announcement came the day after five of the college's Trustees resigned at once.Associated Press \\"Cooper Union President Resigns\\" The New York Times (June 11, 2015)Woodhouse, Kellie. \\"Cooper Union Upheaval\\" Inside Higher Education (June 11, 2015) * September 2: The New York State Attorney General announced that the lawsuit by the Committee to Save Cooper Union against the Board of Trustees of Cooper Union was settled with the filing of a consent decree, still to be approved by the court. The AG will appoint an independent monitor to oversee the school's finances and stated that he will work with all parties \\"to put Cooper Union back on a path to fiscal sustainability\\". The Board of Trustees will add representatives of the school's students, alumni, and faculty. A committee will be created by the trustees to find a way to return the school to tuition-free status, while maintaining its academic reputation and historical level of enrollment. It will need to issue annual progress reports that will culminate with a published strategic plan by January 2018.Staff. \\"New York Reaches Deal with Cooper Union, Plaintiffs\\" Diverse: Issues in Higher Education (2015-09-02) * December 17: Nancy Bannon officially signs off on the filed consent decree. Though the delay in signing caused Consent Decree VI, a requirement for a financial monitor to be installed before December 1 to be impossible, Judge Bannon notes that \\"the cross- petition is granted in its entirety and the Consent Decree is signed simultaneously herewith\\". According to the consent decree, Lincer and former chairman Robert Bernhard shall have their terms expire as of December 7, 2016. No chairman shall receive \\"emeritus\\" title while the consent decree remains in effect. 2016 * January 8: In discussing the possibility of attempting to establish a tuition charging permanent administration, presidential search committee co-chairman Johnny C. Taylor, Jr. notes that \\"To give out a 50% tuition cut to everyone admitted is a high-class problem in anyone else‚Äôs world\\". 2018 * January 15: The Free Education Committee (FEC) of the school's Board of Trustees released their recommended plan to return to full- tuition scholarships for undergraduates only by the academic year starting in the Fall of 2028. CU administration views In December 2015, Acting President Bill Mea noted \\"I have projected numbers out to fiscal 2019 and 2020, and I think it can become financially sustainable by those periods and thereafter\\", with tuition. In an interview with an alumnus, former Board chairman Mark Epstein said \\"in the 70s it became apparent that the school couldn't be sustainable forever ... I would imagine that if people paid 10% over the last 40 years, the school would be in pretty good shape\\". Epstein and Vice Chairman Francois de Menil were among those who resigned along with Jamshed Bharucha in June 2015. Former chairman, Richard Lincer, noted of the decision on January 10, 2014, that: \\"the easiest thing would be for me to say, 'We‚Äôre going to keep it'. And then in 3 years, we might be dissolved. And I‚Äôm not going to have that on my conscience. I‚Äôm going to weigh the risks. And this is a considered judgement and one that the board made\\". He also noted that the board \\"met without the president\\" when coming to this decision. According to consent decree IV.A.1, Lincer & former chairman, Robert Bernhard, shall have their terms expire as of December 7, 2016. In response to the Committee to Save Cooper Union's lawsuit, Justin Harmon, a spokesman for Cooper Union since 2013, told the Wall Street Journal: \\"The decision to charge tuition was tremendously difficult and every member of the Cooper community feels the profound effect it has had‚Ä¶ We are disappointed that the Committee to Save Cooper Union would choose costly litigation over constructive conversation... Beginning this fall, we have increased financial assistance to the most needy students‚Ä¶ Cooper Union will remain among the most affordable elite institutions in the world\\". Free Cooper Union Red Clock Logo Red Square Organized protest efforts=Free Cooper Union Free Cooper Union is the name of an organized effort to protest the 2011 proposed changes in the Cooper Union tuition policy. The group demanded a vote of no confidence in the school president, Jamshed Bharucha. Free Cooper Union is responsible for a sit-in at the President's office in June, 2012, and two occupations of the Foundation Building, one in December 2012, and one in May 2013. =Symbols= The red square is worn as a symbol of support for the Free Cooper Movement. It was built from the carr√© rouge (red square) worn for the 2012 Quebec student protests against tuition hikes. The patch also symbolizes the Cooper Union clock tower, which is red when illuminated. =Exhibition: \\"The Free Cooper Union Salon: Step Down!\\"= In May 2013, Students for a Free Cooper Union held an exhibition in connection with the occupation of President Jamshed Bharucha's office, called, \\"The Free Cooper Union Salon: Step Down!\\" The exhibition included work from students, alumni, faculty and the community. Friends of Cooper Union Friends of Cooper Union (FOCU), composed of alumni, students, faculty, and staff, met in December 2011 to generate its own solutions to the financial crisis. The Way Forward, released in April 2012, outlined future plans without tuition and demanded more transparency and community engagement from the administration. They developed a financial plan based on reasonable measures to start cutting costs and develop more effective fundraising based on the school's mission. Committee to Save Cooper Union Committee to Save Cooper Union, Inc. (CSCU), a voluntary association of faculty, students, and alumni, formed on December 16, 2013 in order to investigate and remedy serious issues regarding the fiscal and academic management of the school. In May 2014, CSCU \\"is pursuing legal action as a last resort after Cooper Union‚Äôs Board of Trustees and administration proceeded with their plans to abolish a 150 year tradition of free tuition, refusing alternatives that would preserve free tuition\\". The Committee to Save Cooper Union filed a Petition with the Supreme Court of the State of New York that was electronically received by New York State Courts Electronic Filing System (NYSCEF) on May 27, 2014. A Memorandum of Law In Support of Petitioner's Article 77 Petition was received by NYSCEF on June 13, 2014. In describing the intent of CSCU's actions, former Cooper Union Trustee Michael Borkowsky stated: \\"This is not a battle between The Committee to Save Cooper Union and The Cooper Union‚Äôs Board of Trustees. It is a battle between The Cooper Union as a unique and extraordinary institution of higher education and The Cooper Union as just another college\\".

Part of the Battle of Belgium and the much larger Battle of France, it started in the afternoon of 26 May and reached its maximum intensity on 27 and 28 May.Ellis, pp. 194‚Äì6, 201‚Äì2 Locally it is referred to as the Battle of the Canal and it is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Battle of Wytschaete. Its official British Army name, which is borne on the battle honours of a number of regiments, is that given here.More, p. xviii Background The origins of the battle lay in the decision by Colonel-General Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of German Army Group A, on 23 May to halt his armoured forces. This 'Halt Order' was later confirmed by Hitler.Frieser, pp. 292‚Äì5 The responsibility for attacking the British, French and Belgian forces trapped in the pocket formed by Army Group A's advance to the coast now lay with Army Group B, on the Allies' eastern front.More, pp. 56‚Äì7 On 24 May Army Group B launched an attack on the Belgian forces stationed along the River Lys east of Menin. This achieved rapid success and as a result Army Group B conceived the idea of changing the direction of attack from northwest to west, in order to cut off the British and French forces in the pocket from the coast. Orders to that effect were issued by German 6th Army, part of Army Group B, at 23.30 on 24 May.Ellis, p. 146; More, p. 56 By 25 May the Belgian armies were retreating in a northerly direction and a gap between them and the British was opening up north of the Lys. This left the German forces space to carry out their planned change of direction.Ellis, p. 148 Lord Gort, the commander of the BEF, had intended to take part in a French led attack southwards in order to bridge the gap between the Allied forces in the pocket and the main French forces further south.Ellis, p. 141 However, by mid-afternoon on the 25th information was reaching Gort about the Belgian collapse and the consequent threat to his north-eastern front.Ellis, p. 148; More, pp. 51‚Äì3 At about 18.00 hours Gort took the decision that 5th Division, which was to have participated in the attack southwards, should instead go north in order to defend the Ypres- Comines Canal running between those two towns.Ellis, p. 149; More, pp. 45‚Äì6, 53 During the 25th the German 6th Army orders, issued on the 24th, concerning the attack westwards were captured by a British unit and made their way back to Gort. It has often been said that this capture caused Gort to take his decision, but it seems clear that he had, in fact, taken it before he was shown the captured orders.More, pp. 50‚Äì53 Prelude The British 5th Division, comprising 13th and 17th Infantry brigades augmented by 143rd Brigade, from 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division, took up position on the Canal during 26 May. The 5th Division was commanded by Major-General Harold Franklyn. During the battle the division was part of British II Corps commanded by Lieutenant-General Alan Brooke. The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division was also sent to Ypres on 26 May, arriving during the night of 26‚Äì27 May. However, it played relatively little part in the battle, which mainly took place south of the town.Blaxland, pp. 259‚Äì61; Ellis, p. 194; More, pp. 152‚Äì3 British troops came across a few Belgian engineers who were prepping bridges on the western part of Ypres for demolition.The War in France and Flanders. Chapter XII The German unit involved was IV Corps, under German 6th Army which was part of Army Group B. It was commanded by General Viktor von Schwedler and consisted of Infantry divisions (ID) 18, 31 and 61.More, pp. 57‚Äì8, 73‚Äì5 The Germans, therefore, started with a considerable superiority in numbers although this was reduced as British reinforcements were fed into the battle. Battle The Germans started probing attacks on the afternoon of the 26th and launched a full-scale attack on the morning of 27 May. By mid afternoon the British line had been forced back, with penetrations of over a mile in the south and north.Blaxland, pp. 262‚Äì5; More, pp. 76‚Äì97 From late afternoon onwards the British launched a series of counterattacks. Units involved included the 2nd Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (13 Brigade) in the centre, and the 6th Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), 13th/18th Royal Hussars, 1/7th & 8th Royal Warwickshire Regiment and Royal Engineers units further south.Barclay, p. 39; Blaxland, pp. 264‚Äì7; Miller, p. 51; More, pp. 121‚Äì2 Later another counter-attack in the south was launched by the 2nd North Staffordshire Regiment and the 3rd Grenadier Guards, borrowed by Brooke from 1st Division. As a result, ID 31's attack in the centre was halted while ID 61 in the south was driven back almost to the Canal. In the north, however, ID 18 continued to advance on the southern side of Ypres.Blaxland, pp. 264‚Äì7; Danchev and Todman, p. 70; Ellis, pp. 95‚Äì6; More, pp. 108‚Äì26 On the 28th the German advance restarted, but made little progress in the centre and south. Some further advances were made in the north but Brooke had switched 10 Brigade from 4th Division and it stabilised the front here.Danchev and Todman, pp. 70, 72; Ellis, p. 202; More, pp. 133‚Äì51 Throughout the battle the British artillery, which was mainly stationed on the Messines‚ÄìWytschaete Ridge, had done much to break up German attacks. There were the equivalent of six field artillery regiments and five medium and heavy regiments. Because of this the British probably had a larger artillery presence than the Germans.

On January 11, 1983, a DC-8 operating Flight 2885 crashed after take-off from Detroit, killing all 3 crew. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation determined that the cause for the crash was pilot error.  Chronology  The aircraft involved in the accident, a 14-year-old Douglas DC-8F-54, registration departed Detroit Metropolitan Airport at 22:15 CST on January 10, 1983, operating United Airlines Flight 2894 bound for Cleveland, Ohio. At Cleveland, the flight became United 2885; the DC-8 departed Cleveland at 01:15 on January 11. It arrived at Detroit airport at 01:52; after a cargo turnaround and refueling, the aircraft began its takeoff roll at 02:51. After taking off, the witnesses described that the nose of the aircraft pitched up to an unusually high position, causing temporary engine surges (witnesses on the ground reported occasional fire eruptions from the engines); soon after, the DC-8 began a gradual right roll, eventually entering an upset condition. As the wings reached an almost 90-degree bank, and at an altitude of approximately , the aircraft stalled and fell to the ground, exploding on impact. The three crew members were Captain William S. Todd (aged 55); First Officer James G. Day (51); and Flight Engineer Robert E. Lee (50). All three were killed.  Causes  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation revealed that, during the cargo turnaround at Detroit, the pilots had a conversation in the cockpit; at one point, the captain asked the first officer if he would like to trade seats with the flight engineer and allow him to perform the takeoff (contrary to both United Airlines and Federal Aviation Administration rules). The first officer accepted the proposition; the flight engineer did express his doubts, but eventually relented and switched seats. As the investigators found, the flight engineer entered a DC-8 first officer upgrade training in June 1979; however, the instructors found his abilities less than adequate and the training was terminated two months later. The flight engineer resumed his first officer training in February 1980, this time for the Boeing 737; while improving, his abilities were still inadequate‚Äîas his instructor stated, \\"...his attitude could not be better and he is a very hard worker, however, he has not made normal progress in his first full year as a first officer.\\" After several failed en-route and proficiency checks, the training manager and the flight engineer made an agreement not to bid anymore for pilot vacancies and remain a flight engineer for the balance of his career. The direct reason for an abnormally nose-up position was found to be an excessively high stabilizer trim setting (7.5 units ANU); likely, in the confusion due to switching seats, the pilots failed to reset the trim setting while performing takeoff checklists. (It was reported the first officer made this mistake occasionally.) Taking off at night, with no visual references, the inexperienced flight engineer did not manage to correct the attitude in time, leading to engine surges, aircraft banking and eventually an upset and an unrecoverable stall. It was not known why the captain did not manage to correct the situation; one possibility was that the flight engineer froze on the controls as he put the DC-8 into a gradual bank, and the opposite inputs from the captain had no effect on the movement of the stabilizer. The captain's decision to allow the flight engineer perform the takeoff was considered a contributing factor in the accident. During an investigation, other United pilots anonymously admitted that swapping seats and flight engineers performing takeoffs and/or landings, while a rare occurrence, were not unheard of on ferry or cargo flights.

Chow's English name \\"Ling Po\\" was coined by Wright by combining Chow's ancestral home Ningbo (then Romanized as Ning Po) and the famous Chinese poet Li Bai (then Romanized as Li Po). One of the last delineators, or rendering artists, of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, he worked on the Frank Lloyd Wright renderings of the Guggenheim Museum interior, the Lenkurt Electric Company, and the Arizona State Capitol. The son of a Chinese Nationalist general and an artist, and an apprentice to Frank Lloyd Wright, Ling Po is best known for his architectural renderings, drawings, landscapes, and his architectural approach to creating sculpture. Ling Po left war-torn China to work in America, in 1945, under provisions of the Lend-Lease Act. He was particularly interested in industrial science and design. Upon his arrival in America, he worked briefly in the office of Marcel Breuer in Washington, DC, and in New York with Morris Sanders, an architect who was noted for using plastics to great advantage in modern design. In 1946, he joined Wright's fabled Taliesin Fellowship. Soon, he was summoned back to China to lead his ailing mother out of harm's way during the communist revolution. Stalled in San Francisco on his return to China, Ling Po aids Wright and William Wesley Peters on working drawings for Wright's V. C. Morris Gift Shop design. After moving his mother to safer ground in the remote Kunming, Ling appeals to Wright and is granted a return to Taliesin with his mother. Ling Po went on to render subsequent Frank Lloyd Wright designs, design and delineate buildings for the Taliesin Associated Architects, and exhibit his art in shows from Wisconsin to California. The Smithsonian Institution, holds a Frank Lloyd Wright textile design in its collection that was executed by Ling Po. He is a contributing artist to Frank Lloyd Wright US Stamp design which was drawn by Patricia Armantides and Ling Po with lettering by Vernon Swaback and technical revisions by John Armantides.  Early life  When he was old enough to hold a brush, Ling's mother tutored him in calligraphy. He spent a couple hours each day learning how to handle a brush, writing Chinese characters. Later, he studied mathematics and literature with a tutor. Ling's mother loved to paint and aptly perceiving her boy's gift enrolled him at age nine in the school of artist Chao Ho Cheng. Ling was deeply influenced by Master Cheng, the artist schoolmaster and art collector who also educated Ling's father. Here, Ling Po learned how to paint in the Chinese tradition, in the midst of a collection of paintings, scrolls, and calligraphy which surveyed 500 years of art in China. Master Cheng encouraged the boy to join a gathering of adult artists who met each Sunday to paint and write poetry. He later studied Architecture at Central University in Chungking, where he first encountered Wright's work. He went on to study at the Art Institute of Chicago before becoming an apprentice at Taliesin and an instructor at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.

She was born in Seville, Spain. She graduated in Art History from the University of Seville.

Afterwards she worked for two years at the Instituto Cervantes de Lyon. Today she lives in New York and works as a professor at New York University.

Works * Criaturas Abisales (2011) * Leche (2013) * Yoro (2015) * Don Quijote de Manhattan (2016) * Seis formas de morir en Texas (2019) Literary Perspective For Marina Perezagua, the literary genre known as short story should not be considered or referred to only as a fragment or part of a book, but as an independent piece that features the very literary and narrative essence as it becomes published autonomously from a novel. Perezagua uses cruelty and unrest in her works and presents those concepts as a rejection of the absurd belief that they are essential for man, just as she often presents the beauty of brutality in her books. Many critics and references to her works underline Perezagua's instinctive nature of writing as the language used in her works does not involve sophisticated words and it does not seek to satisfy the reader, but sheds a narrative instinct in her words and books. For Perezagua is essential to have a clear final previously planned for each work because it gives her certain control as she writes and allows her to \\"hold everything in every part, from the beginning, in every line\\". As for the accuracy of the narrative, Marina considers that it needs to serve the imagination: \\"I am interested in scientific writing at the level of speculation and invention.\\"elmundo.es/cultura/2014/03/10/531d8b73268e3ed82f8b4571.html In her books miscegenation between good and evil, men and women, animals and people is commonly used. Marina says that the best creation is when you take the best of each specie or object and create a perfect fusion, following some guidelines and not randomly.

Born in Newport, Monmouthshire, he was educated privately. He was active in local politics as a member of the vestry or local authority for the central London parish of St Martin in the Fields, and he assumed the nom de plume of \\"Martyn Field\\". Among his plays were The Late Lamented, The Bungalow and The Other Fellow. In 1896 Horner purchased the Whitehall Review, becoming its editor-proprietor. Member of parliament Horner was a member of the executive and finance committees and of the council of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations, and at the 1895 general election was an unsuccessful candidate for the constituency of Southwark West. At the next so-called \\"khaki\\" election in 1900, held at the height of the Second Anglo-Boer War, he won the seat of Lambeth North, a seat previously held by the Liberal Party. Horner's single term in parliament was mired in financial scandal: at the end of 1900 Horner formed Mayfair Printing & Publishing Limited, a company to which he assigned the copyright and goodwill of the Whitehall Review. In 1902 and 1903 Henry Labouch√®re, Liberal MP for Northampton alleged that Horner had obtained cash or credit from a number of hotels on the Continent using company cheques which were not honoured by the bank. In November 1905 Labouch√®re published further allegations in his periodical Truth. These detailed five more dishonoured company cheques cashed by Horner in Monaco, France and Switzerland, totalling in excess of 500 pounds. Horner launched libel proceedings against the magazine without success. By the time of the general election called in January 1906, he had been disowned by the Conservative Party, who nominated another candidate for his Lambeth North seat. Horner defended his seat as an Independent Unionist, but secured only 108 votes, finishing last of the four candidates. Bankruptcy and imprisonment In February 1906 liquidators were appointed to Mayfair Printing & Publishing Limited. Horner claimed to have resigned as a director of the company some time before, but it became clear that he had made a number of financial transactions on behalf of the company for which no proper accounts had been made. In July 1906 Horner failed to attend a bankruptcy hearing, his medical witness stating that he was \\"confined to his bed, suffering from complete mental prostration\\". Despite repeated adjournments, by the end of the year he had been judged bankrupt. In February 1910 Horner was charged with unlawfully forging and uttering telegrams. The alleged offence had been committed during the election campaign in the previous month. Horner had sent a telegram to the editor of the Daily Mail, impersonating one of its regular correspondents. He claimed to have witnessed the Liberal leader, David Lloyd George, being assailed by an angry group of voters in Falmouth, Cornwall. He detailed how they accused Lloyd George of cowardice and how he had to be rescued from the scene by police. The Daily Mail duly printed the story, but later retracted it. Horner attempted to send another telegram repeating the allegations and stating that \\"foreigners\\" were trying to suppress the truth. On 11 March he was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to six weeks imprisonment.

The larvae will then develop and feed inside the stems of the host plants. The pattern of diversification in this genus suggests stepping-stone dispersal. It is hypothesized that these flightless insects disperse from one island to another by rafting on their host plants. This could be facilitated by the wood-boring life-style of the eggs and larvae, as well as the air cavity under the fused elytra that help adults to float. However, experiments with Pachyrhynchus jitanasaius suggest that survival of adults in water‚Äîfresh, brackish, or marine‚Äîis low (most died within 12 hours, and no individual survived longer than 40 hours). On the other hand, the larvae living in Barringtonia asiatica fruit is higher, with a fraction of larvae surviving six days of sea water exposure and successfully emerging as adults.

Woodbridge is known for his collaborations with independent film director Flavio Alves and award-winning guitarist/ producer Dean Bailin as well as for his theatrical scores and two albums, Picture This and Jack of Hearts. Early life Woodbridge was born and raised in the West Side neighborhood of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He is the son of John (deceased) and Joan Kenney Woodbridge and is a 1974 graduate of West Scranton High School. He discovered his love for music at an early age and began playing the piano at age eight. He wrote his first song, \\"Debbie Dear,\\" at age 12 and began singing professionally following his graduation from high school. Woodbridge graduated with a B.A. in Advertising from Pennsylvania State University in 1978. He self-designed his curriculum to include an emphasis on Music, Graphic Arts, Film and Photography. He has been a member of ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) since 1996.  Career  Woodbridge has worked for many years as a keyboardist and vocalist for several bands in Northeastern Pennsylvania; including OFAY (1974), The Stones Show and W.A.M.M. As a solo pianist, he has focused on the Great American Songbook, contemporary standards and his own original compositions. He has performed at various clubs, restaurants and private events throughout the world. As the event pianist for Merrill Lynch, he performed at the Plaza, Waldorf and Ritz hotels in New York City. He continues to perform live throughout Manhattan and Northeast Pennsylvania. Composer  Woodbridge has lived in New York City since 1985. With the encouragement and support of Tony Martell of CBS Records, he began to compose as a freelance writer for the label‚Äôs publishing division, CBSongs. As a composer, Woodbridge has scored the music to several films; including ‚ÄúEven in My Dreams,\\" The Secret Friend and Tom in America, all directed by Flavio Alves. He has also scored the off- Broadway show, \\"The Tale of Tyler T\\" and a musical revue concept called \\"Vampire Blues,\\" as well as a rock opera, \\"The Great Northeast,\\" that was recorded and aired on public radio in 1991. \\"The Great Northeast\\" was recorded and produced by George Graham. Woodbridge is working on a soundtrack to a theatrical production based on the life of Vincent van Gogh that is scheduled for a production in early 2014. Woodbridge‚Äôs original music has been featured on the CNN television network, where he wrote the main themes for various productions, including \\"Showbiz Today.\\" His music has also been featured as a part of the New York City Marathon and the New York Dance Alliance. His music has been recorded by Babs Winn and the Kicking Boogie Band, Sharon McKnight and Laurie Naughton and he has co-written with two-time Academy Award-winning composer Al Kasha and award-winning lyricist Valerie Ciptak. Woodbridge has also composed jingles and other promotional music for the Maloney and Fox Agency in New York City; including for General Motors and Microsoft.  Albums and live performances  Having always loved live performance, Woodbridge returned to the stage in the early 2000s and his shows began to quickly sell out, most notably at Sam‚Äôs Cabaret in New York City. This led to his first album, Picture This (2006), a collection of jazz, pop and blues produced and arranged by Dean Bailin. Woodbridge‚Äôs second album, Jack of Hearts (2010), is considered his most personal work. The music included on the album was inspired from his diagnosis and subsequent recovery from a rare spinal tumor that could have left him paralyzed. Once again produced by Bailin, ‚ÄúJack of Hearts‚Äù reached considerable success, including a sold-out show in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as well as a sold-out encore. The single, \\"Broken,\\" has received much critical acclaim and has been turned into a major music video for Joe Van Wie Productions. Completely recovered from his illness, Woodbridge returned to live performing, following a two-year hiatus, in the spring of 2013. His third album, once again produced by Bailin, featuring acclaimed saxophonist \\"Blue\\" Lou Marini, is slated for release in 2014.

As early as 1953, a newspaper article described WRAP as ‚Äúthe only station in the Tidewater area of Virginia which beams its programs exclusively to a Negro audience.‚Äù An early station slogan that appeared in newspaper advertisements declared that the station played the ‚ÄúMusic That Belongs to America.‚Äù Move to AM 850 In 1957, WRAP moved to AM 850.Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 268 The change in frequency allowed it to broadcast around the clock with more power, 5,000 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night. An advertisement in the 1957 edition of Broadcasting Yearbook, using the descriptions of the era, said \\"Survey figures show the most Negroes in the Norfolk area listen most to WRAP.\\" It added that WRAP, at 850 kilocycles, was \\"the only all-Negro station in Norfolk.\\" In December 1978, five African American WRAP DJs joined together and asked the station‚Äôs white management for raises. They were summarily fired. One of the DJs, Randy Williams, managed to issue an on-air ‚Äústatement of solidarity‚Äù in protest of the firings before he was forced to leave the station. The next month, ‚ÄúThe WRAP Fired Five‚Äù organized a public rally to protest WRAP. They called for African Americans in the area to boycott the station, citing both the unfair firings and the management‚Äôs deeper insensitivity to the black community‚Äôs needs. Switch to AM 1350 In 1986, a local cable television company, Clinton Cablevision, bought WRAP.Broadcasting Yearbook 1987 page B-299 Two years later, the cable company changed it to WNIS, a news/talk station. WRAP's call letters and R&B; format moved to AM 1350 in nearby Portsmouth. That station was owned by a Philadelphia-based black businessman, Ragan Henry, who also owned urban radio stations in Kansas City and Tampa. In 1989, the station changed its ownership to Three Chiefs Broadcasting. The call sign was switched to WBSK. The WRAP call letters were sold to a North Carolina broadcaster. Shortly thereafter, the new management at WBSK fired fifteen employees ‚Äì many of them longtime WRAP personalities ‚Äì without any warning. The WBSK management justified these actions by arguing that the staffers had not yet completed a 90-day probationary period they had started at the station and were thus subject to termination without notice. The station switched to a gospel music format. Format WRAP aired a mix of music, Religious shows, black college football games, and programming for homemakers. It was best known for playing R&B; and Rock 'N' Roll in the 1950s, and for its funk and soul hits in the 1960s and the 1970s, and then in the 1980s H.J. Ellison became the first deejay to host a show devoted to a new type of music called hip-hop in Afternoon Drive at WRAP. Disc Jockeys WRAP‚Äôs first three full-time black disc jockeys were Robert ‚ÄúBob‚Äù King, Milton \\"Milt\\" Nixon, and Oliver Allen. WRAP‚Äôs most popular deejay was Jackson ‚ÄúBig Daddy Jack‚Äù Holmes. Born in 1915 in Merchantsville, New Jersey, outside Philadelphia, Jack began his radio career at WLOW in Portsmouth in September 1949. Within a few years, Jack had developed a devoted following in the area. And then in the late 1950s Jack joined the WRAP staff and became their most prominent deejay. Other popular deejays at WRAP over the years were Jay Dee Jackson, Frankie ‚ÄúThe WRAP Soul Ranger‚Äù Stewart, Throckmortan \\"Gosh Oh Gee\\" Quiff, Maurice Ward, H.J. Ellison, William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Boykins, Chester Benton, Alvin Reaves, Calvin \\"Shakespeare\\" Perkins, with Calvin Cooke, and Leola Dyson. One of the first black female radio deejays in the country, Leola directed public relations for WRAP and performed on the air for more than twenty years. Reunion WRAP staffers came together for a reunion in 2003, organized by Chester Benton and Bill Boykins.

These models, which provide 3D coordinates for each atom in the molecule (see example in the image), come from structural biology experiments such as x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The validation has three aspects: 1) checking on the validity of the thousands to millions of measurements in the experiment; 2) checking how consistent the atomic model is with those experimental data; and 3) checking consistency of the model with known physical and chemical properties. Proteins and nucleic acids are the workhorses of biology, providing the necessary chemical reactions, structural organization, growth, mobility, reproduction, and environmental sensitivity. Essential to their biological functions are the detailed 3D structures of the molecules and the changes in those structures. To understand and control those functions, we need accurate knowledge about the models that represent those structures, including their many strong points and their occasional weaknesses. End-users of macromolecular models include clinicians, teachers and students, as well as the structural biologists themselves, journal editors and referees, experimentalists studying the macromolecules by other techniques, and theoreticians and bioinformaticians studying more general properties of biological molecules. Their interests and requirements vary, but all benefit greatly from a global and local understanding of the reliability of the models. Historical summary Macromolecular crystallography was preceded by the older field of small- molecule x-ray crystallography (for structures with less than a few hundred atoms). Small-molecule diffraction data extends to much higher resolution than feasible for macromolecules, and has a very clean mathematical relationship between the data and the atomic model. The residual, or R-factor, measures the agreement between the experimental data and the values back-calculated from the atomic model. For a well-determined small-molecule structure the R-factor is nearly as small as the uncertainty in the experimental data (well under 5%). Therefore, that one test by itself provides most of the validation needed, but a number of additional consistency and methodology checks are done by automated software as a requirement for small-molecule crystal structure papers submitted to the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) journals such as Acta Crystallographica section B or C. Atomic coordinates of these small-molecule structures are archived and accessed through the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) or the Crystallography Open Database (COD). The first macromolecular validation software was developed around 1990, for proteins. It included Rfree cross-validation for model-to-data match, bond length and angle parameters for covalent geometry, and sidechain and backbone conformational criteria. For macromolecular structures, the atomic models are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), still the single archive of this data. The PDB was established in the 1970s at Brookhaven National Laboratory, moved in 2000 to the RCSB (Research Collaboration for Structural Biology) centered at Rutgers, and expanded in 2003 to become the wwPDB (worldwide Protein Data Bank), with access sites added in Europe () and Asia (), and with NMR data handled at the BioMagResBank (BMRB) in Wisconsin. Validation rapidly became standard in the field, with further developments described below. *Obviously needs expansion* A large boost was given to the applicability of comprehensive validation for both x-ray and NMR as of February 1, 2008, when the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) made mandatory the deposition of experimental data along with atomic coordinates. Since 2012 strong forms of validation have been in the process of being adopted for wwPDB deposition from recommendations of the wwPDB Validation Task Force committees for x-ray crystallography, for NMR, for SAXS (small-angle x-ray scattering), and for cryoEM (cryo-Electron Microscopy).  Stages of validation  Validations can be broken into three stages: validating the raw data collected (data validation), the interpretation of the data into the atomic model (model-to- data validation), and finally validation on the model itself. While the first two steps are specific to the technique used, validating the arrangement of atoms in the final model is not. Model validationGeometry=Conformation (dihedrals): protein & RNA= The backbone and side-chain dihedral angles of protein and RNA have been shown to have specific combinations of angles which are allowed (or forbidden). For protein backbone dihedrals (œÜ, œà), this has been addressed by the legendary Ramachandran Plot while for side-chain dihedrals (œá's), one should refer to the Dunbrack's Rotamer library. Though, mRNA structures are generally short-lived and single- stranded, there are an abundance of non-coding RNAs with different secondary and tertiary folding (tRNA, rRNA etc.) which contain a preponderance of the canonical Watson-Crick (WC) base-pairs, together with significant number of non-Watson Crick (NWC) base-pairs - for which such RNA also qualify for regular structural validation that apply for nucleic acid helices. The standard practice is to analyse the intra- (Transnational: Shift, Slide, Rise; Rotational: Tilt, Roll, Twist) and inter-base-pair geometrical parameters (Transnational: Shear, Stagger, Stretch, Rotational: Buckle, Propeller, Opening) - whether in-range or out-of-range with respect to their suggested values. These parameters describe the relative orientations of the two paired bases with respect to each other in two strands (intra) along with those of the two stacked base pairs (inter) with respect to each other, and, hence, together, they serve to validate nucleic acid structures in general. Since, RNA-helices are small in length (average: 10-20 bps), the use of electrostatic surface potential as a validation parameter has been found to be beneficial, particularly for modelling purposes. = Packing and Electrostatics: globular proteins = For globular proteins, interior atomic packing (arising from short-range, local interactions) of side-chains has been shown to be pivotal in the structural stabilization of the protein-fold. On the other hand, the electrostatic harmony (non-local, long-range) of the overall fold has also been shown to be essential for its stabilization. Packing anomalies include steric clashes, short contacts, holes and cavities while electrostatic disharmony refer to unbalanced partial charges in the protein core (particularly relevant for designed protein interiors). While the clash-score of Molprobity identifies steric clashes at a very high resolution, the Complementarity Plot combines packing anomalies with electrostatic imbalance of side-chains and signals for either or both. =Carbohydrates= A 2D diagram of an N-glycan linked to an antibody fragment in the structure with PDB accession code '4BYH'. This diagram, which has been generated with Privateer, follows the standard symbol nomenclature and includes, in its original svg format, annotations containing validation information, including ring conformation and detected monosaccharide types. The branched and cyclic nature of carbohydrates poses particular problems to structure validation tools. At higher resolutions, it is possible to determine the sequence/structure of oligo- and poly-saccharides, both as covalent modifications and as ligands. However, at lower resolutions (typically lower than 2.0√Ö), sequences/structures should either match known structures, or be supported by complementary techniques such as Mass Spectrometry. Also, monosaccharides have clear conformational preferences (saturated rings are typically found in chair conformations), but errors introduced during model building and/or refinement (wrong linkage chirality or distance, or wrong choice of model - see for recommendations on carbohydrate model building and refinement and for reviews on general errors in carbohydrate structures) can bring their atomic models out of their energy minima. Around 20% of the deposited carbohydrate structures are in unjustified energy minima. A number of carbohydrate validation web services are available at glycosciences.de (including nomenclature checks and linkage checks by pdb-care, and cross- validation with Mass Spectrometry data through the use of GlycanBuilder), whereas the CCP4 suite currently distributes Privateer, which is a tool that is integrated into the model building and refinement process itself. Privateer is able to check stereo- and regio-chemistry, ring conformation and puckering, linkage torsions, and real-space correlation against positive omit density, generating aperiodic torsion restraints on ring bonds, which can be used by any refinement software in order to maintain the monosaccharide's minimal energy conformation. Privateer also generates scalable two-dimensional SVG diagrams according to the Essentials of Glycobiology standard symbol nomenclature containing all the validation information as tooltip annotations (see figure). This functionality is currently integrated into other CCP4 programs, such as the molecular graphics program CCP4mg (through the Glycoblocks 3D representation, which conforms to the standard symbol nomenclature) and the suite's graphical interface, CCP4i2. Validation for crystallography=Overall considerationsGlobal vs local criteria= Many evaluation criteria apply globally to an entire experimental structure, most notably the resolution, the anisotropy or incompleteness of the data, and the residual or R-factor that measures overall model-to-data match (see below). Those help a user choose the most accurate among related Protein Data Bank entries to answer their questions. Other criteria apply to individual residues or local regions in the 3D structure, such as fit to the local electron density map or steric clashes between atoms. Those are especially valuable to the structural biologist for making improvements to the model, and to the user for evaluating the reliability of that model right around the place they care about - such as a site of enzyme activity or drug binding. Both types of measures are very useful, but although global criteria are easier to state or publish, local criteria make the greatest contribution to scientific accuracy and biological relevance. As expressed in the Rupp textbook, \\"Only local validation, including assessment of both geometry and electron density, can give an accurate picture of the reliability of the structure model or any hypothesis based on local features of the model.\\" What can be seen in low vs high resolution macromolecular crystal structures =Relationship to resolution and B-factorData validationStructure factors=TwinningModel-to-data validationResiduals and Rfree=Real-space correlationImprovement by correcting diagnosed problems=In nuclear magnetic resonance=Data Validation: Chemical Shifts, NOEs, RDCs ;AVS: Assignment validation suite (AVS) checks the chemical shifts list in BioMagResBank (BMRB) format for problems. ;PSVS: Protein Structure Validation Server at the NESG based on information retrieval statistics ;PROSESS: PROSESS (Protein Structure Evaluation Suite & Server) is a new web server that offers an assessment of protein structural models by NMR chemical shifts as well as NOEs, geometrical, and knowledge-based parameters. ;LACS:Linear analysis of chemical shifts is used for absolute referencing of chemical shift data.

Model validation: as above NMR structural ensemble for PDB file 2K5D, with well-defined structure for the beta strands (arrows) and undefined, presumably highly mobile regions for the orange loop and the blue N-terminus Dynamics: core vs loops, tails, and mobile domains One of the critical needs for NMR structural ensemble validation is to distinguish well-determined regions (those that have experimental data) from regions that are highly mobile and/or have no observed data. There are several current or proposed methods for making this distinction such as Random Coil Index, but so far the NMR community has not standardized on one. Software and websites=In Cyro-EM In SAXS  SAXS (small-angle x-ray scattering) is a rapidly growing area of structure determination, both as a source of approximate 3D structure for initial or difficult cases and as a component of hybrid-method structure determination when combined with NMR, EM, crystallographic, cross-linking, or computational information. There is great interest in the development of reliable validation standards for SAXS data interpretation and for quality of the resulting models, but there are as yet no established methods in general use. Three recent steps in this direction are the creation of a Small-Angle Scattering Validation Task Force committee by the worldwide Protein DataBank and its initial report, a set of suggested standards for data inclusion in publications, and an initial proposal of statistically derived criteria for automated quality evaluation. For computational biology It is difficult to do meaningful validation of an individual, purely computational, macromolecular model in the absence of experimental data for that molecule, because the model with the best geometry and conformational score may not be the one closest to the right answer. Therefore, much of the emphasis in validation of computational modeling is in assessment of the methods. To avoid bias and wishful thinking, double-blind prediction competitions have been organized, the original example of which (held every 2 years since 1994) is CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) to evaluate predictions of 3D protein structure for newly solved crystallographic or NMR structures held in confidence until the end of the relevant competition. The major criterion for CASP evaluation is a weighted score called GDT-TS for the match of Calpha positions between the predicted and the experimental models.

Academia Sinica, Taiwan's national level research institute, officially inaugurated its Institute of Taiwan History in 2004 following a long exploratory period beginning in 1986. Taiwan studies departments and centers have been established in numerous universities around the world (see below for a list) and key Taiwan studies organizations have been established in North America (NATSA), Europe (EATS), and Japan (JATS). The first World Congress of Taiwan Studies (WCTS) was hosted by Taiwan's Academia Sinica on April 26‚Äì28, 2012, in Taipei, Taiwan. More recently, China has begun to establish its own controversial version of Taiwan studies in the United States via its Confucius Institutes.  History of Taiwan Studies  As with all area studies, funding and interest in Taiwan studies has largely followed American and other nations' changing political interests. Japanese interest in Taiwan studies preceded significant Western interest in the island and its diverse set of people beginning as a part of maintaining its own colonial interests there (Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1895-1945), and continuing in a post- colonial mode following the handover of Taiwan to the Republic of China (ROC) following its defeat in World War II. An early peak of interest by Western scholars in studying Taiwan occurred following the defeat of the Kuomintang (KMT) in the Chinese civil war and its subsequent retreat to Taiwan beginning in 1947. With China's Communist Party taking power in mainland China, the mainland quickly became off-limits for the vast majority of Western sinologists (exceptions included William Hinton, author of Fan Shen). This closing off, in concert with the United States' strong political and military support for Taiwan and British Hong Kong as bulwarks against Communist expansion, ushered in a \\"golden age\\" for the study of China beyond China, including increasing studies of \\"Chinese\\" in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Following diplomatic shifts of recognition away from the Taiwan-based ROC towards the China-based PRC beginning in the late 1970s and picking up speed with China's reform and opening, academics once again began to shift their focus on China to the mainland. Western academic interest in Taiwan continued at a lower rate with a relatively strong focus on the politics of Taiwan-China-United States relations across the Taiwan Straits. Leading up to the end of martial law in Taiwan in 1987, a space began to open up for criticism of KMT authoritarian rule and the beginnings of discussions of a history of the people of the geographic islands of Taiwan. Previous history textbooks that students in martial law Taiwan studied from began history centered on dynastic events in China and only shifted focus to the island the students lived on as the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1947. This Taiwanization movement suggested instead that it was worthwhile to study the local history of Taiwan itself: a history which included long periods of habitation by disparate groups of aboriginal peoples, early colonizations by European powers, rule by Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), waves of migrations of Hok'lo and then Hakka Chinese people from mainland China, a short period of nominal Qing \\"Chinese\\" Rule, and a Japanese colonial period all prior to the establishment of Taiwan as the base of power of the ROC in exile. In academia, Taiwanization and democratization in Taiwan brought about a new interest in studying Taiwan and its people without assuming that they are representative of something, or at least of a single something, \\"Chinese.\\" Taiwan studies today involves a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences both in Taiwan and beyond it that work to take Taiwan itself as a central subject of analysis. This includes not just work on Taiwanese or Aboriginal groups on Taiwan, but also includes comparative work as well as work that focuses on cross-straits issues and \\"Chinese\\" (or Han, Hok'lo, or Hakka) cultures as instantiated on Taiwan. The biggest difference in the latter work is that Taiwan studies scholars who study \\"Chinese\\" culture on Taiwan do so with an understanding of the vast range of historical, political, and economic influences on Taiwan's people that have been completely different from those that have influenced \\"Chinese\\" heritage peoples in, for example, Hong Kong, Singapore, or the PRC.

According to tax records, the company had on average 45 enslaved workers from 1760 to 1780, who worked as foreman, founders, laborers and blacksmiths. Though both the Snowdens and Cowmans were wealthy Quakers whose children intermarried, they owned slaves for a century.

Byrne departed the role of Lily in 1989, and it was recast with actress Heather Rattray. In 1993, Rattray was let go from the series and Byrne returned to the role. In 2008, Byrne made her high-profiled exit from the series and the role was once again recast with Noelle Beck, who remained in the role until the series finale in September 2010. Hensley is the only actor to portray the role of Holden for the character's duration with the series. Following Byrne's high-profiled exit, followed by the split of Holden and Lily, that the ratings for World Turns suffered, ultimately leading to its untimely cancellation in 2009.  Casting = Lily Walsh Snyder  The role of Lily Walsh was originated by actress Lucy Deakins, who debuted in the role in June 1984. Deakins departed the role a year later in 1985 and actress Martha Byrne took claim. Byrne remained with the series for four years, until she decided to depart the role; she was subsequently replaced by actress Heather Rattray. Upon Rattray's dismissal in 1993, Byrne returned to the role. Byrne remained in the role for nearly 15 years, until in 2008, she announced her decision to depart the series over contract negotiations. The role was then recast with former Loving actress Noelle Beck, who remained with the series until its final episode in September 2010.  Holden Snyder  In 1985, actor Jon Hensley was hired into the role of Holden Snyder and made his debut in October 1985. In 1987, it was announced that Hensley would depart the series following the completion of his contract later in the same year. Hensley returned three years later in 1990, only to depart the role once more in 1995. In 1997, Hensley returned for a second time to the role.

In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named the couple one of their \\"17 Great Soap Supercouples\\" at number seven. Byrne revealed that the pairing of Lily and Holden was by chance, due to then-head writer Douglas Marland. She remarked, \\"It was only supposed to be for the summer.

She won both her races in 1980, including the Princess Margaret Stakes before her season was curtailed by illness and injury, and was rated the equal-best two-year-old filly in Europe. In the following year she was narrowly beaten in the Classic 1000 Guineas before winning the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. After finishing second in her three remaining races she was retired to stud, where her record as a dam of winners was disappointing. Background Tolmi was a \\"strong, compact\\" dark-coated bay filly with a very small white star and a white sock on her left hind leg, bred in England by her owner George Cambanis. Her dam Stilvi was bought by Cambanis as a yearling and became a top-class racehorse, winning the King George Stakes and Duke of York Stakes and an outstanding broodmare. Before Tolmi, she had produced Tachypous (Middle Park Stakes), Tromos (Dewhurst Stakes) and Tyrnavos (Irish Derby). She was sired by Great Nephew, a British stallion whose other progeny included Grundy and Shergar. The filly was sent into training with Bruce Hobbs at his Palace House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in all but her final race by Edward Hide. Racing career=1980: two-year-old season Tolmi began her racing career in the Princess Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in July. According to Timeform's annual Racehorses of 1980, she \\"outclassed\\" her nineteen opponents, winning easily by four lengths from Exclusively Raised, a filly who went on to win the May Hill Stakes. Later that month he started 4/5 favourite for the Group Three Princess Margaret Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse. Her bridle broke on the way to the start and had to be repaired, delaying the race and causing the filly to become unsettled. She started slowly but took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by one and a half lengths and six lengths from Kittyhawk and Her Grace. Tolmi's next race was scheduled to be the Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse in August but she was withdrawn from the race after being found to have a \\"low blood count\\". In her absence, Kittyhawk won the race impressively. Tolmi was being prepared for a run against the season's other outstanding two- year-old filly Marwell in the Cheveley Park Stakes when her season was ended by a cannon bone injury in early September. At the end of the year she was the ante-post favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas. 1981: three- year-old season Tolmi made her three-year-old debut in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 30 April. Her preparation had been disrupted by a muscle injury and she arrived at Newmarket looking less than fully fit. Starting the 11/2 third favourite she tracked the leaders and appeared to be travelling strongly entering the final furlong. In a \\"thrilling finish\\" she finished second, beaten a neck by Fairy Footsteps, just ahead of Go Leasing, Marwell and Madam Gay. She was then dropped in class for a race at Kempton Park Racecourse, but appeared to struggle on the prevailing soft ground and finished fourth of the six runners behind Nasseem. In June, Tolmi faced Nasseem on firm ground in the Coronation Stakes, which was then a Group Two race, at Royal Ascot and started at odds of 4/1. She was always well-placed, and after being switched to the outside in the straight to obtain a clear run she accelerated into the lead and won by half a length from the Irish filly Happy Bride, with Nasseem in third place. In the Child Stakes at Newmarket in July, Tolmi was beaten three lengths when attempting to concede six pounds to Robert Sangster's filly Star Pastures. Later in the month was beaten a length when conceding three pounds to the same filly in the Royal Wedding Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Tolmi and Star Pastures met yet again, this time at level weights, in the Heathorns Stakes at Goodwood in September, with Star Pastures emerging the winner by two lengths. There was some speculation that the filly would contest the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, but she never raced again and was retired to stud. Assessment In 1980, the independent Timeform organisation gave Tolmi a rating of 122, making her the second highest-rated two-year-old filly of the season behind Marwell. In the official International Classification she was rated equal to Marwell as the best two-year-old filly in Europe, six pounds behind the leading colt Storm Bird. In the following year she was rated ten pounds below Marwell (the top-rated three-year-old filly) in the International Classification and was rated 120 by Timeform. Stud record Tolmi was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Following the death of Cambanis in 1981, she was owned by the Stilvi Compania Financiera.

During the fighting on 8 April, the Bosnian Croat TO was reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeƒáe obrane ‚Äì HVO). The objective of the battle was to control the strategic Kupres Plateau, a major supply route. The opposing sides began bringing in reinforcements to the Kupres Plateau on 5 March to strengthen positions held around individual settlements populated by different ethnic groups, communications between those positions, and roads leading away from the plateau to the north and south. Different parts of the town of Kupres were controlled by the opposing forces, while the adjacent territory surrounding the town was controlled by the Bosnian Croat TO. In turn, that territory was surrounded by Bosnian Serb TO-held territory. By the end of the month, the bulk of the civilians living in the area were evacuated. On 2 April, negotiations to defuse the situation failed while the reinforcements continued to arrive. The battle commenced the next day. In Kupres itself, the Bosnian Croat TO achieved minor territorial gains on 4‚Äì5 April, before the JNA managed to advance to the outskirts of the town the next day. The JNA entered Kupres in the afternoon of 7 April and in the next few days, it successfully drove the Croatian forces from the plateau. The breakthrough came about after the infantry originally deployed to the battle was reinforced by an armoured battalion deployed from Knin. Croatian forces were hampered by an inadequate command structure, poor coordination and lack heavy weapons. The battle resulted in more than 200 combat deaths, and established lines of control which would remain unchanged until 1994, when the plateau was recaptured by the HVO. In 2012, Republika Srpska authorities charged seven Croats with war crimes committed at the plateau against civilians and prisoners of war. The next year, Croatian authorities charged 21 former JNA members with war crimes against HVO prisoners captured at the Kupres Plateau. Background As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija ‚Äì JNA) withdrew from Croatia following the implementation of the Vance plan, it was reorganised into a new Bosnian Serb army. This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February ‚Äì 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration was later cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. On 27 March, Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska ‚Äì HV) 108th Brigade in response. Control of the Kupres area was contested by Bosnian Serbs and Croats. Before the war, the former represented the majority of the population on the Kupres Plateau, comprising a total of 51 percent of its inhabitants, while Croats accounted for 39 percent. The JNA deployed an armoured unit based in Mostar to the plateau in May 1991. The bulk of the force moved to Knin three months later, while a tactical group of the 30th Partisan Division redeployed to the general area as it withdrew from Slovenia after the Ten-Day War. In September, the Bosnian Croats established the Territorial Defence Force (Teritorijalna obrana ‚Äì TO) headquarters which set up armed volunteer units. By November, these units had been organised as the Kupres Battalion. The battalion consisted of five companies and an independent platoon. A Central Intelligence Agency report described the unit as a \\"barely organized collection of mostly local villagers and townspeople\\". The arming of the various forces was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September 1991. In early 1992, the 30th Partisan Division was subordinated to the JNA 5th (Banja Luka) Corps and assigned Kupres as its area of responsibility (AOR). The division, likely comprising only 2,000 troops, was under the command of Colonel Stanislav Galiƒá. As of 19 March, the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps was under command of Lieutenant General Momir Taliƒá. In April, the Bosnian Serbs were able to deploy 200,000 troops, hundreds of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks were largely unprepared for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons. Prelude On 5 March, the Bosnian Serb TO requested equipment for two companies mobilised in villages around Kupres‚ÄîMalovan, Riliƒá and Ravno. The mobilisation was motivated by poor military intelligence provided by the 30th Partisan Division. It indicated the presence of thousands of HV and Bosnian Croat troops in the vicinity of Kupres, supported by Leopard 1 tanks drawn from a contingent of approximately 100 Leopards that the JNA believed had been delivered to Croatia. In response, the division was tasked to deploy its elements to Kupres, Kljuƒç, Mrkonjiƒá Grad, ≈†ipovo, Jajce and the Mount Vla≈°iƒá, take command of the Bosnian Serb TO and repel the expected Croatian attack. In order to achieve this, the division mobilised the 1st, 13th and 19th Partisan Brigades‚Äîassigning Kupres to the 19th Brigade as its AOR. By 23 March, the brigade received mobilised troops sufficient to set up three companies. Their immediate task was to block the Malovan and Kupre≈°ka Vrata mountain passes. The next day, the divisional commander toured the plateau and was informed that the Bosnian Croat forces were in control of the villages of Olovo, Osmanlije and Zlosela, in addition to Kupre≈°ka Vrata. On 26 March, the Bosnian Serb TO battalion based in Malovan was subordinated to the 19th Partisan Brigade. At this time, both sides had a relatively small portion of their force inside Kupres, while the Bosnian Croat TO held the area adjacently surrounding the town. The Bosnian Serb TO and the JNA completely controlled the areas surrounding the Bosnian Croat TO force. The Malovan-based battalion set up its first roadblock on 26 March, and the Kupres Battalion established its own checkpoints in response the following day. On 27 March, an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement failed and the commanding officer of the 19th Partisan Brigade announced that armed combat might start at a moment's notice. The news prompted the evacuation of civilians of all ethnicities on 27‚Äì28 March. According to the daily report of the 30th Partisan Division of 29 March, the Kupres Plateau was deserted except for able bodied and armed men. The same report noted that the JNA could not deploy to Kupres itself without a fight. The JNA was convinced that the HV had intervened at Kupres to threaten the Bosnian Serbs. Kupres had a high strategic value, because it sat astride a road linking the towns of Bugojno and Tomislavgrad from the central Bosnia region to western Herzegovina and further on to Croatia. Reinforcements The initial phase of the Battle of Kupres On 29 March, the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps of the JNA decided took the initiative around Kupres, redeploying elements of the 1st Battalion of the 13th Partisan Brigade to the Kupres Plateau, along with units drawn from the 9th (Knin) Corps, and the 293rd Engineer Regiment. A company of the 3rd Battalion of the 13th Partisan Brigade was also moved to the plateau on the following day, while the rest of the brigade was ordered to be ready to move to Kupres. The Kupres Battalion of the Bosnian Croat TO mobilised an additional 200 troops in Kupres the same day. On 31 March, the strengthened 1st Motorised Battalion of the 11th Motorised Infantry Brigade, drawn from the 9th (Knin) Corps, arrived at the Kupres Plateau. The battalion was strengthened by the addition of a battery of five mortars, six howitzers, three ZiS-3 guns and a platoon of recoilless rifles. In the afternoon of 2 April, a five-hour meeting of local political leaders took place in Kupres, at the request of JNA. The purpose of the meeting, attended by members of Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Biljana Plav≈°iƒá and Franjo Boras, was to defuse the situation. While there was an agreement to establish an ethnically balanced police force in Kupres and remove the roadblocks, the opposing sides could not agree on the role of the JNA. The Bosnian Serbs wanted the JNA to deploy to Kupres itself to ensure their protection, while the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks wanted it to leave. During that same day, the 30th Partisan Division ordered the forces under its command, as well as the recent reinforcements, to capture Kupres and Kupre≈°ka Vrata and then hold their ground against anticipated Croatian counterattacks. Bosnian Croat authorities ordered the mobilisation of TO units in the nearby towns of Tomislavgrad and Posu≈°je, with an armoured force at their disposal consisting of two T-55 tanks, two M36 tank destroyers, and one BVP M-80 infantry fighting vehicle. There were 100‚Äì200 HV troops in Kupres during the battle. Those included a group drawn from the 204th Brigade, led by Robert Zadro (son of late Blago Zadro, former commander of the 3rd Battalion of the brigade). During the fighting, elements of the Zrinski Battalion reached Kupres, while relatively small groups of soldiers drawn from the Frankopan Battalion and the 4th Guards Brigade arrived when the battle was nearly over. A company drawn from the 126th Infantry Brigade was deployed in ≈†uica, but it is unclear if it actively took part in the battle. There were also Croatian Defence Forces (Hrvatske obrambene snage ‚Äì HOS) units raised in Tomislavgrad and Posu≈°je, which were involved in the fighting around Kupres. At the time, overall command of the Bosnian Croat forces was held by Brigadier Milivoj Petkoviƒá. Timeline Map of the Battle of Kupres 3 April According to the JNA, the Bosnian Croat TO attacked in the morning of 3 April, reached the village of Donji Malovan and blockaded the Kupre≈°ka Vrata Tunnel by 7:30 a.m. The village was captured by Croats after three hours of combat, and the fighting shifted towards the village of Gornji Malovan and Kupres. By the end of the day, the Bosnian Serb TO force in Gornji Malovan was besieged. The JNA instructed the Yugoslav Air Force to attack after it received reports that 15 HV tanks had appeared on the battlefield. The 30th Partisan Division staff amended the plans formulated the previous day and advanced with elements of the 11th Motorised Brigade towards Kupres via Zlosela, against positions held by the Kupres Battalion at 1:15 p.m. The change of plans enabled elements of the 13th Partisan Brigade to catch up to them by 6:00 p.m. and caused the attack to fail. Following news of the fighting, the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps called on its troops deployed in western Slavonia to reinforce the 30th Partisan Division. The corps felt it could weaken its positions in western Slavonia because the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) peacekeepers were expected to deploy there by the end of the month based on the Vance plan. Those troops consisted of the Volunteer Battalion of the 5th Corps, and they were augmented by the 2nd Howitzer Battalion of the 5th Mixed Artillery Regiment. The 1st Battery of the 5th Light Anti-Aircraft Defence Regiment was also added to the battalion. 4‚Äì5 April On 4 April, the Bosnian Croat TO captured Gornji Malovan. At the same time, the Bosnian Croat TO received reinforcements from Posu≈°je, as well as a company from Bugojno and Uskoplje each. Fighting intensified as the JNA reinforcements arrived. A part of the Croatian reinforcements, which had just arrived from Bugojno and Uskoplje, fled after coming under attack near Zlosela. However, the JNA failed to achieve a breakthrough‚Äîeven with five attack helicopters deployed in support of its advance towards Zlosela and Kupre≈°ka Vrata at 1:30 p.m. The forces attacking towards Kupre≈°ka Vrata were redeployed the next day to assist in the advance towards Zlosela. In Kupres itself, the Bosnian Croat TO secured the western part of the town, as well as Gornji Malovan. Regardless, no significant territory changed hands. Although the 9th (Knin) Corps dispatched ten tanks to Kupres from its 9th Tank Company, commanded by Colonel Slavko Lisica, only four of them reached Kupres, as six broke down along the way. In the town of Kupres itself, the Bosnian Croat TO was reinforced by the arrival of a group drawn from the HV special forces Zrinski Battalion. The 30th Partisan Division lost contact with the JNA troops (1st Battalion of the 19th Partisan Brigade) in Kupres at 1:00 p.m. 6 April At dawn on 6 April, the JNA launched a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupre≈°ka Vrata, leaving the bulk of the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the force at the plateau. The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks. The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company, which quickly pushed through the defensive positions, bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo. In contrast, the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres was overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation and could not track which units it had at its disposal‚Äîeven losing track of units physically near the command post. The JNA further reinforced its position at the Kupres Plateau by ordering the redeployment of the 9th Armoured Battalion of the 9th (Knin) Corps to the area. It also established the Operational Group 11 (OG-11) which was to take over the operation on 7 April, when the AOR of the 9th Corps was extended to the region. At the same time, the armoured and mechanised assets of the force were organised into the Tactical Group 1 (TG-1), commanded by Lisica. By the end of the day, the divisional reserve was committed to the battle, and the JNA claimed that they had captured Zlosela, Olovo and Osmanlije, as well as reaching the outskirts of Kupres. The Bosnian Croat TO captured the centre of Kupres and brought the 1st Battalion of the 19th Partisan Brigade into a difficult position, only to begin withdrawing towards Tomislavgrad after the main JNA force reached the town in the night of 6/7 April. Likewise, the Bosnian Croat TO started to pull back from Kupre≈°ka Vrata. 7 April On 7 April, the bulk of the 9th Armoured Battalion arrived on the battlefield, adding 17 T-55s, eight M-60 APCs and five BVP M-80s. The unit entered Kupres in the late afternoon, followed by two battalions of the 13th Partisan Brigade. A battalion of the 11th Motorised Brigade performed mopping up operations in the Zlosela area. A part of the Bosnian Croat TO force was retreating in disarray, while a portion of the force was trapped in Kupres and Zlosela, trying to break out. In the evening, as the mop-up of the Olovo and Osmanlije area was completed, the OG-11 ordered attacks against Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan. The next day, the TG-1 received a commendation by the commander of the 9th (Knin) Corps, Major General Ratko Mladiƒá. Final operations After it captured Kupres, the OG-11 turned south, in the direction of Gornji Malovan, Donji Malovan and ≈†uica. The attack, spearheaded by the 9th Armoured Battalion, reached Gornji Malovan on 10 April, the day Robert Zadro was killed. Fighting continued around Kupres until 11 April. Most of the Bosnian Croat TO troops, formally reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeƒáe obrane ‚Äì HVO) on 8 April, withdrew from the Kupres Plateau towards ≈†uica, while a small portion of the troops was forced to retreat via the Mount Cincar towards Livno. Aftermath Kupres and a part of the plateau, seen in 2009 Sources disagree on the number of Bosnian Croat and HV casualties. Their number is variously reported as 160 or 177 killed. The Bosnian Serbs and the JNA sustained losses of 85 killed and 154 taken prisoner of war. The JNA also captured 23 Bosnian Croat TO troops. The figures are reported to include 19 civilian deaths on each side. Even though the Serbian media initially reported that the villages of Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan had been torched and razed to the ground, the information proved to be incorrect‚Äîthe settlements sustained relatively minor damage. Conversely, Croat- or Bosniak-inhabited villages were looted and torched. Zlosela suffered extensive damage‚Äîthe village school was the only structure with a roof left in place. Command and coordination of the Bosnian Croat forces had been particularly poor throughout the battle. HV General Janko Bobetko arrived in Tomislavgrad on 11 April to find that a company of the HV 126th Infantry Brigade, deployed to ≈†uica, had left its positions on its own accord. The move was followed by preparations for the evacuation of ≈†uica in expectation of a JNA advance south from Kupres. Bobetko managed to turn the 126th Brigade back to ≈†uica, persuading them to defend the town overnight in order to defend the entire region. It is not clear if the OG-11 intended to continue its advance towards ≈†uica though. Soon after the Battle of Kupres, a portion of the 9th Armoured Battalion was transferred to Glamoƒç to support the Bosnian Serb TO attack towards Livno there. The lines of control stabilised and would not shift in the area for more than two years, until the 1994 Battle of Kupres. By mid-May 1992, Bosnian Serb forces controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. War crime charges In 2012, Republika Srpska authorities charged seven Bosnian Croat officials and HVO officers with the killings of 19 Serb civilians and 20 members of the Bosnian Serb TO in the area of Kupres in 1992. The charges also pertained to the abuse of 18 prisoners of war captured in the Battle of Kupres. In 2013, Croatian authorities in ≈†ibenik charged 21 former members of the JNA with the abuse of 23 HVO prisoners of war. The charges specify that the prisoners were detained and abused in Knin prison between 24 April and 14 May. The abuse is alleged to have caused the deaths of two of the prisoners and grave injuries to three others.

Cistern in the western rock outcrop Tanstein Castle () is the ruin of a rock castle in the southern Palatine Forest, the German part of the Wasgau region. It lies just under a kilometre east of the small town of Dahn in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Location  Tanstein is one of the three castles at Dahn; the others being Altdahn and Grafendahn. Although the three castles are sited next to one another on a hill ridge, they were not built at the same time. A similar cluster of castles are also found in the Vosges in nearby Alsace: the three castles of Husseren.  History  Tanstein is the oldest of the three castles in the group. An 1127 document refers to an Anshelmus de Tannicka as the owner or governor; as a result the castle was probably built in the early 12th century. In 1189, in a deed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, a Henry von der Than is mentioned and the castle designated as an immediate imperial fief. In the period that followed, Ulrich of Dahn and Conrad of Dahn are named as imperial ministeriales. In 1328 the castle became a fief of the bishops of Speyer. Until 1464 there were frequent changes of ownership, which suggests that the fief was still not inheritable during this phase, but was always re-enfeoffed. In 1512 Frederick of Dahn purchased the castle. Because he was an ally of the knight, Franz von Sickingen, he was involved in his battles against the imperial princes in southwest Germany. After Sickingen's defeat and death in 1523, Tanstein, too, fell into the hands of the victors. Its occupation by troops of the Archbishop of Trier lasted until 1544 and probably led to irreparable damage to the structure of the castle, because it was finally abandoned in 1585. In 1689, at the start of the War of the Palatine Succession, the French completely destroyed the ruins.  Site  Tanstein Castle is located on the two westernmost rock outcrops of the Dahn castle cluster. Both were originally linked by a bridge. On the rocks today are modern parapet walls that have been rather arbitrarily added and do not give any real idea of the old castle buildings. On the western rock outcrop there were apparently domestic-like buildings, that were built against the rocks. This is evinced by putlock holes and other marks on the rocks as well as a large cistern, in which water from the roofs was gathered and stored. The lower ward on the southern rock outcrop still shows traces of the original walls dating to the 15th century. These include the ruins of a smithy and a smelting furnace.

Writing assessment can be considered a combination of scholarship from composition studies and measurement theory within educational assessment.Behizadeh, Nadia and George Engelhard Jr. \\"Historical View of the influences of measurement and writing theories on the practice of writing assessment in the United States\\" Assessing Writing 16 (2011) 189-211. Writing assessment can also refer to the technologies and practices used to evaluate student writing and learning.Huot, B. & Neal, M. (2006). Writing assessment: A techno-history. In C. A. MacArthur, S. Graham, & J. Fitzgerald (Eds.), Handbook of Writing Research (pp. 417-432). New York, NY: Guilford Press. Contexts Writing assessment began as a classroom practice during the first two decades of the 20th century, though high-stakes and standardized tests also emerged during this time.Behizadeh, Nadia and George Engelhard Jr. \\"Historical View of the influences of measurement and writing theories on the practice of writing assessment in the United States\\" Assessing Writing 16 (2011) 189-211 During the 1930s, College Board shifted from using direct writing assessment to indirect assessment because these tests were more cost- effective and were believed to be more reliable. Starting in the 1950s, more students from diverse backgrounds were attending colleges and universities, so administrators made use of standardized testing to decide where these students should be placed, what and how to teach them, and how to measure that they learned what they needed to learn.Yancey, Kathleen Blake. \\"Looking Back as We Look Forward: Historicizing Writing Assessment as a Rhetorical Act.\\" College Composition and Communication. 50.3 (1999): 483-503. Web. 23 Feb. 2013. The large-scale statewide writing assessments that developed during this time combined direct writing assessment with multiple-choice items, a practice that remains dominant today across U.S. large scale testing programs, such as the SAT and GRE. These assessments usually take place outside of the classroom, at the state and national level. However, as more and more students were placed into courses based on their standardized testing scores, writing teachers began to notice a conflict between what students were being tested on‚Äîgrammar, usage, and vocabulary‚Äîand what the teachers were actually teaching‚Äîwriting process and revision. Because of this divide, educators began pushing for writing assessments that were designed and implemented at the local, programmatic and classroom levels.Huot, Brian. (Re)Articulating Writing Assessment for Teaching and Learning. Logan, Utah: Utah State UP, 2002. As writing teachers began designing local assessments, the methods of assessment began to diversify, resulting in timed essay tests, locally designed rubrics, and portfolios. In addition to the classroom and programmatic levels, writing assessment is also hugely influential on writing centers for writing center assessment, and similar academic support centers. History Because writing assessment is used in multiple contexts, the history of writing assessment can be traced through examining specific concepts and situations that prompt major shifts in theories and practices. Writing assessment scholars do not always agree about the origin of writing assessment. The history of writing assessment has been described as consisting of three major shifts in methods used in assessing writing. The first wave of writing assessment (1950-1970) sought objective tests with indirect measures of assessment. The second wave (1970-1986) focused on holistically scored tests where the students' actual writing began to be assessed. And the third wave (since 1986) shifted toward assessing a collection of student work (i.e. portfolio assessment) and programmatic assessment. The 1961 publication of Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability in 1961 by Diederich, French, and Carlton has also been characterized as marking the birth of modern writing assessmentBroad, Bob. What we Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing. Logan, UT: Utah State University Press, 2003. Print. Diederich et al. based much of their book on research conducted through the Educational Testing Service (ETS) for the previous decade. This book is an attempt to standardize the assessment of writing and is responsible for establishing a base of research in writing assessment.Diederich, P.G.; French, J. W.; Carlton, S. T. (1961) Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability. Princeton, NJ: Educational Testing Service Major concepts=Validity and reliability The concepts of validity and reliability have been offered as a kind of heuristic for understanding shifts in priorities in writing assessmentYancey, Kathleen Blake. \\"Looking Back as We Look Forward\\" as well interpreting what is understood as best practices in writing assessment.O'Neill, Peggy, Cindy Moore, and Brian Huot. A Guide to College Writing Assessment. Logan, UT: Utah State University Press, 2009. Print. In the first wave of writing assessment, the emphasis is on reliability:Yancey, Kathleen Blake. \\"Looking back as We Look Forward\\" reliability confronts questions over the consistency of a test. In this wave, the central concern was to assess writing with the best predictability with the least amount of cost and work. The shift toward the second wave marked a move toward considering principles of validity. Validity confronts questions over a test's appropriateness and effectiveness for the given purpose. Methods in this wave were more concerned with a test's construct validity: whether the material prompted from a test is an appropriate measure of what the test purports to measure. Teachers began to see an incongruence between the material being prompted to measure writing and the material teachers were asking students to write. Holistic scoring, championed by Edward M. White, emerged in this wave. It is one method of assessment where students' writing is prompted to measure their writing ability.\\"Holisticism.\\" College Composition and Communication, 35 (December, 1984): 400-409. The third wave of writing assessment emerges with continued interest in the validity of assessment methods. This wave began to consider an expanded definition of validity that includes how portfolio assessment contributes to learning and teaching. In this wave, portfolio assessment emerges to emphasize theories and practices in Composition and Writing Studies such as revision, drafting, and process. Direct and indirect assessment Indirect writing assessments typically consist of multiple choice tests on grammar, usage, and vocabulary. Examples include high-stakes standardized tests such as the ACT, SAT, and GRE, which are most often used by colleges and universities for admissions purposes. Other indirect assessments, such as Compass, are used to place students into remedial or mainstream writing courses. Direct writing assessments, like Writeplacer ESL (part of Accuplacer) or a timed essay test, require at least one sample of student writing and are viewed by many writing assessment scholars as more valid than indirect tests because they are assessing actual samples of writing. Portfolio assessment, which generally consists of several pieces of student writing written over the course of a semester, began to replace timed essays during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Portfolio assessment is viewed as being even more valid than timed essay tests because it focuses on multiple samples of student writing that have been composed in the authentic context of the classroom. Portfolios enable assessors to examine multiple samples of student writing and multiple drafts of a single essay. As technology=Methods Methods of writing assessment vary depending on the context and type of assessment. The following is an incomplete list of writing assessments frequently administered: Portfolio Portfolio assessment is typically used to assess what students have learned at the end of a course or over a period of several years. Course portfolios consist of multiple samples of student writing and a reflective letter or essay in which students describe their writing and work for the course.Emmons, Kimberly. \\"Rethinking Genres of Reflection: Student Portfolio Cover Letters and the Narrative of Progress.\\" Composition Studies 31.1 (2003): 43-62.Neal, Michael. Writing Assessment and the Revolution in Digital Texts and Technologies. NY: Teachers College, 2011.White, Edward. \\"The Scoring of Writing Portfolios: Phase 2.\\" College Composition and Communication 56.4 (2005): 581-599. \\"Showcase portfolios\\" contain final drafts of student writing, and \\"process portfolios\\" contain multiple drafts of each piece of writing.Yancey, Kathleen. \\"Postmodernism, Palimpsest, and Portfolios: Theoretical Issues in the Representation of Student Work.\\" ePortfolio Performance Support Systems: Constructing, Presenting, and Assessing Portfolios. Eds Katherine V. Wills and Rich Rice. Fort Collins, Colorado: WAC Clearinghouse. Web. 16 November 2013. Both print and electronic portfolios can be either showcase or process portfolios, though electronic portfolios typically contain hyperlinks from the reflective essay or letter to samples of student work and, sometimes, outside sources. Timed-essay Timed essay tests were developed as an alternative to multiple choice, indirect writing assessments. Timed essay tests are often used to place students into writing courses appropriate for their skill level. These tests are usually proctored, meaning that testing takes place in a specific location in which students are given a prompt to write in response to within a set time limit. The SAT and GRE both contain timed essay portions. Rubric A rubric is a tool used in writing assessment that can be used in several writing contexts. A rubric consists of a set of criteria or descriptions that guides a rater to score or grade a writer. The origins of rubrics can be traced to early attempts in education to standardize and scale writing in the early 20th century. Ernest C Noyes argues in November 1912 for a shift toward assessment practices that were more science-based. One of the original scales used in education was developed by Milo B. Hillegas in A Scale for the Measurement of Quality in English Composition by Young People. This scale is commonly referred to as the Hillegas Scale. The Hillegas Scale and other scales used in education were used by administrators to compare the progress of schools.Turley, Eric D. and Chris Gallagher. \\"On the 'Uses' of Rubrics: Reframing the Great Rubric Debate\\" The English Journal Vol 97. No. 4. (Mar. 2008) pp 87-92. In 1961, Diederich, French, and Carlton from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) publish Factors in Judgments for Writing Ability a rubric compiled from a series of raters whose comments were categorized and condensed into a five-factor rubric:Diederich, P.G.; French, J. W.; Carlton, S. T. (1961) Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability. *Ideas: relevance, clarity, quantity, development, persuasiveness *Form: Organization and analysis *Flavor: style, interest, sincerity *Mechanics: specific errors in punctuation, grammar, etc. *Wording: choice and arrangement of words As rubrics began to be used in the classroom, teachers began to advocate for criteria to be negotiated with students to have students stake a claim in the how they would be assessed. Scholars such as Chris Gallagher and Eric Turley,Turley, Eric D. and Chris Gallagher. \\"On the 'Uses' of Rubrics: Reframing the Great Rubric Debate\\" Bob Broad,Broad, Bob. What we Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing and Asao InoueInoue, Asao B. \\"Community-based Assessment Pedagogy.\\" Assessing Writing. 9 (2005): 208-38. Web. 23 Feb 2013. (among many) have advocated that effective use of rubrics comes from local, contextual, and negotiated criteria. Multiple-choice test Multiple-choice tests contain questions about usage, grammar, and vocabulary. Standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, and GRE are typically used for college or graduate school admission. Other tests, such as Compass and Accuplacer, are typically used to place students into remedial or mainstream writing courses. Automated essay scoring Automated essay scoring (AES) is the use of non-human, computer- assisted assessment practices to rate, score, or grade writing tasks. Race Some scholars in writing assessment focus their research on the influence of race on the performance on writing assessments. Scholarship in race and writing assessment seek to study how categories of race and perceptions of race continues to shape writing assessment outcomes. However, some scholars in writing assessment recognize that racism in the 21st century is no longer explicit,Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo. Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States. Lanham, MD: Rowman & LittleField Publishers, Inc., 2006. Print. but argue for a 'silent' racism in writing assessment practices in which racial inequalities in writing assessment are typically justified with non-racial reasons.Behm, Nicholas, and Keith D. Miller. \\"Challenging the Frameworks of Color-blind Racism: Why We Need a Fourth Wave of Writing Assessment Scholarship.\\" Race and Writing Assessment. Asao B. Inoue, and Mya Poe, eds. NYC: Peter Lang Publishing, 2012. 127-38. Print. These scholars advocate for new developments in writing assessment, in which the intersections of race and writing assessment are brought to the forefront of assessment practices.

In 1867, she published The Story of Aunt Becky's Army-Life, an account of her wartime experiences. Early life and marriages She was born in Ithaca, New York as Sarah A. Graham. She married Abel O. Palmer, who died before 1862, and married David C. Young on April 6, 1867, after the Civil War. Nursing during the Civil War Palmer left Ithaca on September 3, 1862, following the 109th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment to Laurel, Maryland and leaving her two daughters in the care of relatives. The regiment initially served at Annapolis Junction, Maryland, guarding the railroad to Washington, D.C. In one anecdote she told, during the Siege of Petersburg Palmer wanted to send a seriously ill patient to Washington but the doctor in charge objected. She managed to obtain a ticket for him and sent him off, leading to an angry argument with the doctor the following day. Later she embellished this story to include multiple patients, and claimed that the doctor took his complaint to Union general Ulysses S. Grant. According to Palmer's later account, Grant \\"laughed and said 'I've got nothing to say. Aunt Becky outranks me!'\\" At some point she acquired the nickname \\"Aunt Becky\\"; it is not clear if this nickname was applied to her during her civilian life before the American Civil War, or if the nickname was given by her patients or colleagues. One secondary source claims that patients often called her \\"Mother\\", a nickname she disliked, and she encouraged using the different nickname after a soldier suggested she looked like his Aunt Becky. After the Civil War Palmer, from a photograph published in 1903 The Story of Aunt Becky's Army-Life was co-authored with Sylvia Lawson Covey. Palmer had kept a full diary of her nursing experiences, but most of the diary was lost, leaving only around three months of material and Palmer's account was therefore largely dictated from memory. After her remarriage in 1867, her family moved to Des Moines, Iowa the following year. Palmer continued to be interested in the welfare of soldiers, and on the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Palmer raised funds for the Iowa Sanitation Commission, which provided medical supplies for the soldiers, and became the Commission's president.

Kastner is currently a Distinguished Professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.  Education  As a child, Miriam Kastner had originally wanted to be a mathematician, she had later decided down the road that, math was not the career for her as there were far fewer careers to pursue in maths. Miriam had noticed that not many women were scientists in her early life, which had inspired her to research further about the different sciences. Kastner attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1964 where she received a minor in chemistry and a master's degree in geology. Kastner then decided to attend Harvard University , Boston in 1970 where she received her Ph.D. in geosciences.  Research career  Over the course of her career Kastner has progressed from being an associate professor, to a professor, and now a distinguished professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where she participated in the writing and publishing of 174 articles and journals. Kastner has worked with the Scripps Institution from 1972 till present. Previously to educating at Scripps Institution, Kastner worked as a Research Associate at Harvard University in the Department of Geological Sciences until 1970. In 1971 she worked at the University of Chicago as a Research Associate in the Department of Geophysical Sciences. Along with being a professor, Kastner has served many roles at Scripps Institution of Oceanography including Chair and Vice Chair of the faculty, Associate Director and Director in the Geosciences Research Division, Chair of Academic Senate Committee on Research, as well as Curricular Group Coordinator of Geological Sciences. Kastner's accomplished many things throughout her entire career but much of what she has achieved came from the earlier part of her career when she put her talents to work and directed her focus on the origin of authigenic feldspars, she also focused on zeolites in the oceanic sediments during that time. With the oceanic sediments she determined that the diagenetic transformations of opal-A to opal-CT and quartz is important to the formation of siliceous marine deposits. Kastner also found that dolomite formation is ultimately controlled by its associated pore-fluid geochemistry. The discovery solved an outstanding problem in carbonate mineral science. Kastner's measurements of the Sr distribution coefficient was critical in building strontium concentrations in calcite, which was ultimately used for paleoclimate studies that are dependent on carbonate Sr proxies, the discovery also was used for indicating carbonate recrystallization. Kastner also worked vigorously on phosphate deposits, her work included a revision of the stability of P-O bonds in apatite and phosphate ions, after the revision there was a recalculation of the ocean residence time of phosphorus.  Research  Kastner is a marine geochemist. Her research expertise is on the fluctuation of fluids at plate boundaries, specifically where two plates meet to cause earthquakes and at ridge-crests where hypothermal deposits are found. Kastner's work is based on numerous studies, including the following: * Long- term monitoring in observatories of marine gas hydrates and implications for climate change, slope stability, and ocean chemistry * On the oceanic contribution of methane to the atmosphere * Chemical paleoceanography: establishing new marine phases based on the ocean's geological history. * Sediment geochemical and diagenetic processes with emphasis on marine authigenic minerals like phosphates, silicates, carbonates Awards and Honors * Guggenheim Fellow (1982) * Charles R.

It was built during the early 3rd century. The arch, with a single span (fornix), was placed on the road leading to Sitifis. It constituted the entrance to the city's Severan forum. History The arch was erected in 216 in honour of the Emperor Caracalla, his mother Julia Domna, and his deceased father Septimius Severus. In 1839, Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans saw the arch during an expedition and planned to have it transported to Paris, where he intended to have it erected with the inscription \\"L'Arm√©e d'Afrique √† la France\\" (The Army of Africa, to France). After his death, in 1842, the project, which was almost ready to be carried out, was abandoned. The arch, together with the rest of the archaeological site of Dj√©mila, has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1982.Entry on Dj√©mila at UNESCO's site Description Part of the Arch of Caracalla at Dj√©mila. The arch, with a single span, reaches a height of 12.5 m, a width on 11.6 m and a depth of 3.9 m. On both sides of the span on the pylons are niches, each framed by a pair of Corinthian columns on pedestals, with smooth drums, detached from the wall. Each pair of columns supports an entablature, which is surmounted in turn by a small aedicula, with a pediment, reaching to the top of the Attic. On top of the Attic, three bases remain, which originally supported statues of the members of the imperial family.

Incumbent President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was re-elected with 82% of the vote. Issues in the campaign included a desire for domestic stability after the bloody civil war of the 1990s, the state of the economy (30% unemployment), the frail health of the 15 year incumbent and 77-year-old president whose speech was \\"slurred and inaudible\\" in his only public outing during the campaign, and the less-than-wholehearted support given the president by the normally united and discrete ruling class. Background Following the 2009 presidential elections, the region and the country (to a lesser degree) was engulfed by the Arab Spring. A series of protests took place between 2010 and 2012, but the country did not undergo regime change unlike neighbouring Tunisia and Libya. Candidates In November 2013, the National Liberation Front endorsed the ailing incumbent Abdelaziz Bouteflika as its candidate in the race. Bouteflika's candidacy was confirmed by then-Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal (who would be later re-appointed to said post) in late February. Ali Benflis, a former Prime Minister, announced on 19 January 2014 that he was running for the presidency. Louisa Hanoune, the secretary-general of the Workers Party, presented her candidacy on 21 January 2014. Campaign The campaign officially started on 22 March 2014. Bouteflika only appeared in the campaigning twice, leaving others in the party to campaign. Boycott and protests The Islamist Movement of Society for Peace announced on 25 January 2014 that it would boycott the elections. The Islamic Renaissance Movement announced on 7 February 2014 that it will also boycott the vote. On 22 March, about 5,000 people rallied in Algiers for a boycott due to Bouteflika seeking another term and called for reforms to the political system. Both Islamic and secular parties were present with Rally for Culture and Democracy's Mohsen Belabes saying: \\"The people here are the people who have been excluded, who have been put aside, but this is the real Algeria. The regime will collapse, but Algeria will survive\\". A movement called Barakat expressed rejection of a fourth term for Abdelaziz Bouteflika, opposed the nature of the elections, and has organized protests demanding a new political order. Opinion polls An opinion poll conducted by Echa√¢b in March showed the incumbent president Bouteflika winning. Conduct The electoral commission reported that there were just a few incidents which entailed just 130 complaints. However, incidents of violence were recorded as groups of youths in the Berber- dominated Kabylie's Bouira region ransacked voting centres in Raffour, M'Chedellah and Saharij just after they opened at 7:00, with riot police then firing tear gas at them. At least 70 people were injured, including 47 policemen as voting was temporarily suspended. In Raffour, masked and armed youths with slings chanted hostile slogans and confronted the police were firing tear gas. Results Interior Minister Taieb Belaiz announced on 18 April that Abdelaziz Bouteflika had won 81.53% of the vote, while Ali Benflis came in second with 12.18%. The turnout was 51.7%, down from the 75% turnout in 2009. Turnout was as low as 20.01% in Tizi Ouzou to as high as 82% in Relizane. Reactions After the polls closed, Benflis criticised the election as having been marked by \\"fraud on a massive scale.\\" The turnout figures were also criticised for allegedly being inflated by unnamed activists and opposition politicians. Benflis told his supporters at his headquarters that due to the scale of the alleged fraud and irregularities: \\"Our history will remember this date as a great crime against the nation by stealing the voice of the citizens and blocking popular will.\\" At the same time, Bouteflika supporters celebrated with fireworks.

Built by Nicholas Snowden on the site of an earlier grist mill, Laurel Mill operated intermittently between 1811 and 1929, manufacturing flour, cloth, cotton duck and other cotton products, and window shades. Between 1835 and 1851 the mill was operated by Horace Capron, who had married into the Snowden family, and the Patuxent Manufacturing Company, who also established the town of Laurel Factory, which was incorporated as Laurel in 1870. Laurel Mill closed by 1929 and was razed in the 1940s, and the grounds of the mill now include the City of Laurel Municipal Pool. The Laurel Museum currently sits opposite the Laurel Mill site, in a home constructed by the mill company. Snowden Family The first building on the site of the Laurel Mill was a stone grist mill constructed in 1811 by Nicholas Snowden, a member of a prominent Maryland family. Snowden's parents \\"Major\\" Thomas Snowden and Ann Ridgely constructed a five-part, Georgian-style home, Montpelier Mansion, near the Patuxent River between 1781 and 1785.Montpelier Mansion. \\"History Nicholas Snowden was born at Montpelier Mansion in 1786, and owned the mansion from 1803 until his death in 1831. In addition to operating his family's 9,000 acre plantation and the Patuxent Ironworks, Snowden opened the grist mill in 1811; by 1820 the mill employed two workers and produced 10‚Äì15,000 bushels of flour.The Laurel Historical Society. \\"Laurel A Mill Town First \\". Horace Capron and the growth of Laurel Factory In 1834 Horace Capron, a businessman who had operated several mills, including Savage Mill in Savage, Maryland, married Nicholas Snowden's daughter Louisa Snowden. A year later, in 1835, he formed the Patuxent Manufacturing Company and expanded on the Laurel Mill building. Aided by the recent construction of the B&O; Railroad, manufacturing boomed at Laurel Mill in the 1840s. By 1845 Capron operated both the Laurel Mill, then called Laurel Factory, and newly built Avondale Mill, employing between 700-800 women and men between the two buildings. Business slowed soon after, and according to the 1850 census Patuxent Manufacturing Company only had 500 employees. That same year the company built a larger dam on the Patuxent River to allow it to shift from water wheel to water turbine power, and also added small steam engines. In 1851 Horace Capron declared bankruptcy and soon after moved to Texas. Ownership of the mill was taken over by the Tiffany family of Baltimore, one of Capron's business partners. The mill went under the management of Robert Pilson, who operated the facility under a reduced 11-hour workload producing 4-4 Brown muslin \\"Laurel-D\\". A fire destroyed the mill in 1855, the same year mill workers went on strike for shorter hours. Already facing multiple business difficulties, the mill shut down operations during the Civil War. During Capron's time in Laurel, the Patuxent Manufacturing Company oversaw the construction of fifty two-story stone and brick tenement style houses to rent to mill employees. Several of these buildings still stand on Main Street, including the building that now houses the Laurel Museum. As the number of men and women employed at the mill increased, the community in the surrounding environs grew into a company town, then known as of Laurel Factory. Post-Civil War and George Nye The company town of Laurel Factory was incorporated in 1870 as the city of Laurel, and the mill continued to be the primary employer in the city.Patti Restivo, \\"Laurel Museum exhibit gives voice to forgotten mill workers.\\" George Nye, a Civil War veteran, served as superintendent of Laurel Mill from 1877 to 1885, during which the mill frequently was closed due to renovations or shortages of manufacturing material.Clara H. Vaughn. \\"Mill superintendent's diaries reveal everyday life in 19th-century Laurel.\\"Laurel Historical Society. \\"George Nye & His Diaries .\\" Ownership of the mill passed hands frequently in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and after Nye's departure the building was auctioned off, and later operated under the name The Laurel Company.Laurel Historical Society. \\"Laurel A Mill Town First .\\" 20th century Operations at the Laurel Mill in the early twentieth century focused solely on cotton duck. In 1901, the Laurel Mills company was consolidated into the Cotton Duck Company (of the Mount Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Company). In 1911 the Consolidated Cotton Duck Company was leased by the Ramie Company of New England. During World War I, much like during the Civil War, mill operations shut down, and the building housed soldiers from Camp Meade, which later became Fort George G. Meade. Between 1922 and 1929 the mill built window shades for the Lapsley Interstate Shade Cloth Company, and shut down in 1929. The building and mill race stood until the 1940s, when it was destroyed. The abandoned dam remained across the Patuxent River until the 1960s, and a portion of the bulwark on the Prince George's County side of the river remains standing.

An offensive player or a defensive player can be penalized for spear tackling. Spearing from an offensive player will result in a 15-yard penalty, whereas spearing from a defensive player will result in an automatic first-down for the offense.  1976 Rule Change  In the year 1976, the tackling technique known as spearing was banned across the board. Associations such as the National Football League (NFL), the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFSHSA) made it illegal to perform any kind of spearing or head down contact to another player. This is mainly due to the severe injuries players would sustain upon using the spearing technique. Although this ban might have decreased the number of head injuries, players use of spearing still persists.  Injury Risks  Within the sport of gridiron football, the spearing technique was responsible for most of the catastrophic cervical spinal cord injuries and concussions, which is a result of axial loading. Recognition of such injuries resulted in rule changes in 1976, banning such tackles for high school and college football, after which incidence of these injuries dropped significantly. For example, incidence of quadriplegia decreased from 2.24 and 10.66 per 100,000 participants in high school and college football in 1976, to 1.30 and 2.66 per 100,000 participants in 1977.

Executed on either 7 or 8 February 1931 by the Kuomintang government in Shanghai for his pro-Communist activities, he is considered one of the Five Martyrs of the League of Left-Wing Writers. Early life and career Rou Shi was born Zhao Pingfu (ËµµÂπ≥Â§ç) on 28 September 1902 in Ninghai County, Zhejiang province. In 1918 he entered Hangzhou No. 1 Normal School in the provincial capital Hangzhou. After graduating in 1923, he became a teacher at Pudi Elementary School in Cixi, Zhejiang. In 1925 he published his first collection of short stories, Mad Man. In 1925 Rou Shi studied briefly at Peking University, but returned to Zhejiang in the spring of 1926, teaching in Hangzhou and Zhenhai. In the summer of 1927 he returned to his hometown Ninghai and taught at Ninghai High School, a local Communist base. After the failed Communist rebellion in May 1928, he took refuge in Shanghai, where he was introduced to the leading leftist writer Lu Xun who lived nearby him. Together with Lu Xun and others, he cofounded the Morning Flower Society (ÊúùËä±Á§æ), which published several progressive journals. Lu Xun stated that the purpose of the Society was to \\"introduce literature from Eastern and Northern Europe and import foreign woodcuts.\\" In January 1929 he succeeded Lu Xun as the editor of the journal Tattler. During this period he wrote the novel February and another collection of short stories entitled Hope (Â∏åÊúõ). He also translated works by foreign writers such as Maxim Gorky. In March 1930, the League of Left-Wing Writers was established in Shanghai. Rou Shi attended its inaugural meeting, and became an executive and standing committee member in charge of the League publication Meng Ya (ËêåËäΩ). He joined the Communist Party of China in May 1930, and published the short story, A Slave Mother (‰∏∫Â•¥Èö∂ÁöÑÊØç‰∫≤). Arrest and execution On 17 January 1931, while attending a secret Communist Party meeting at the Oriental Hotel in the Shanghai International Settlement, Rou Shi was arrested along with 35 other attendees by the Shanghai Municipal Police. They were handed over to the Kuomintang government and held in prison for three weeks. On 7 February 1931, the Kuomintang executed 23 Communists in Longhua, Shanghai. The five members of the Left League executed on that day, Rou Shi, Li Weisen, Hu Yepin, Yin Fu, and Feng Keng, are called the Five Martyrs of the League of Left-Wing Writers by the Communist Party. Among the executed were three women, one pregnant. They were executed either by gunshot or by being buried alive. According to Frank Moraes, Rou Shi was in the latter group, but an article on Xinhua says he was killed by gunshots. In the essay \\"Remembrance for the Sake of Forgetting\\" (‰∏∫‰∫ÜÂøòÂç¥ÁöÑÁ∫™Âøµ), Lu Xun states that Rou Shi was shot ten times. Works and adaptations One of Rou Shi's best known short stories, A Slave Mother, was first translated to English by Edgar Snow in 1936. In 1963, his novel February was adapted to the critically acclaimed film Early Spring in February, which was directed by Xie Tieli and starred Sun Daolin, Shangguan Yunzhu, and Xie Fang. In 2003, A Slave Mother was adapted to a television film starring He Lin, who won the Best Actress award of the 2005 International Emmy Award for her performance in the film. He also wrote various proses and essays, including 'A Wife‚Äôs Farewell'. Memorials On the 100th anniversary of his birth in 2002, Rou Shi's hometown Ninghai restored his former residence and opened it as a museum in his memory. In addition, the county opened the newly built Rou Shi Park covering an area of 250 mu.

History  The name \\"Neudahn\\" (\\"New Dahn\\") is rather confusing, because the castle is older than Grafendahn Castle in the nearby group of three castles of Dahn, albeit more recent than Altdahn (\\"Old Dahn\\"). Its location enabled it to protect and block the old road running through the Wieslauter valley, the course of which is now used by the B 427 federal highway and the Wieslauter Railway. The castle was probably built just before 1240 by order of the Bishop of Speyer, because from 1233 to 1236 the office was held by a certain Conrad IV of Dahn. The governing ministerialis was Henry of Dahn, who is also recorded as Henry Mursel of Kropsberg. He was probably granted the castle from the outset as a heritable fief. His second name, like other later heirs, indicates clearly that there were family ties with the South Palatinate ‚Äì Kropsburg and Burrweiler. The castles is first mentioned on 3 May 1285 as Burg Than, an assessment of the estate mentioned in the deed indicating that it must refer to Neudahn.Grathoff 2003, p. 4 (s. Literature) p Within a hundred years of the castle being built, the Mursel family died out, and its possession passed to the related Altdahn line. Probably razed during the Four Lords' War of 1438 and then rebuilt, the site was again badly damaged during the German Peasants' War in 1525. Because, King Henry II of France stayed overnight at the castle in 1552, it must have been thoroughly renovated before then. After the last lord of Dahn, Ludwig II died in 1603 in his castle at Burrweiler, Neudahn was returned to the Prince-Bishopric of Speyer. From then on the castle was used by the episcopal Amtmann as his headquarters until French troops finally destroyed it in 1689 at the start of the War of the Palatine Succession. Today the castle appears to visitors largely as it did in the renovation and extension phase in the period after 1525 and after the last destruction. Safety and restoration measures took place in the 1970s. The site is managed by the Generaldirektion Kulturelles Erbe Rheinland-Pfalz, Direktion Burgen, Schl√∂sser, Altert√ºmer, and, together with Berwartstein Castle, 10 kilometres away, is one of the best preserved castles in the southern Palatine Forest.  Site  Plan of the castle Inner gate and newel tower North side. From the left: inner gate, newel tower and remains of domestic buildings in the upper ward on the sandstone rocks Embrasures on the southern battery tower Left of the place where the original gates were located, in the southeast, are the remains of a tower, 7 metres in diameter. From this tower, parts of a thick defensive wall runs westwards, before bending north. On the steep northern and northeastern side of the hillside the wall has entirely disappeared. It led to the flanking tower at the northern end of the site. Of the oldest ‚Äì late Hohenstaufen ‚Äì castle on the vertically hewn, central rock outcrop, which is just under 20 metres high, the only surviving features are a cistern at the western end and the southern wall of the small palas with its window and door openings. At the northwestern end of the main rock outcrop in the south was a late medieval domestic building and, west of that, a well. A formerly plastered newel tower from the same period on the northwestern edge of the rock outcrop leads up to the upper ward. The actual entrance into the ground floor is, as on many castles, probably not authentic and may have been made for modern visitors, which the date 1975 over the entrance suggests. It also lies outside the inner gate. The historic entrance is inside the gate to the left and at a higher level. The dominant image of the castle is the two four-storey, roughly 24 metre-high, battery towers on the opposite side. They date to the first half of the 16th century. The west tower measures about 7 metres in height, the east tower, about 10 metres. The thickness of the walls is about 3 metres. Two embrasures (so-called Maulscharten) on the southern battery tower have been ornately carved into the shape of lions' faces.Braun 1997, pp. 471. On the continuation of the hill to the east-southeast the site was protected by a wedge-shaped bastion that was also a recognition feature of Neudahn. Its shape was intended to prevent shells from striking the castle frontally. It protected the upper ward on the more gentle slope of the hill on that side. The bastion and the weapon towers show that, in the late Middle Ages, considerable modifications to the castle were carried out and the lords of the castle took account of the introduction of firearms and cannon.

The sanitarium was founded in 1905 by Dr. Jesse C. Coggins and Dr. Cornelius DeWeese to treat patients with mental illness and addiction. It was converted to a women's nursing home in 1950. The facility closed after Coggins' death in 1963, and was demolished by controlled fire in 1964. Operation The sanitarium was founded in 1905 by Doctors Jesse C. Coggins and Cornelius DeWeese to treat patients with mental illness and addiction. The facility sat on 163 acres and housed 90 women patients, two full-time physicians and 42 employees in four main buildings and five cottages. Many dignitaries from Washington sought treatment at Laurel Sanitarium, though most are not known due to Dr. Coggins' discreet nature. One such patient that became known was J. Edgar Hoover's father, who was committed in 1917. Coggins' first wife, Mabel, hanged herself at the sanitarium in 1931, and news coverage implied she was a patient there. Cofounder DeWeese died in 1934. Coggins' second wife, Helen, was a nurse at the facility when they married in 1941. Coggins was a proponent of families visiting patients at least once a week and by 1950 the sanitarium had treated over 20,000 patients. Coggins ultimately believed that there was only one good treatment for alcoholics, Alcoholic's Anonymous. Each guest occupied a private room, many with personal furnishings and family mementos, thereby creating a home-like setting. Early expansion A Keeley Institute addiction treatment center had been operated from the 1890s about a half mile closer to downtown Laurel. Built originally as the Brewster Park Hotel in the 1880s, that facility closed after Keeley's methods were found to be fraudulent. It changed ownership again in 1906 and was reopened as the Dr. Flora A. Brewster Sanitarium, though went bankrupt only months later. Brewster was the second female surgeon in Baltimore. Doctors Coggins and DeWeese bought the property at auction in 1906 and moved the building in late 1908 and early 1909 from its 5th and Talbott Street location to their sanitarium's campus off Route 1, where it became a men's dormitory. The move was called \\"the largest job of house-moving ever attempted in Maryland\\". The grounds included an area of . Women's hospital From 1950 until operations ceased, the sanitarium was operated as a 90-bed women's geriatric hospital. When the facility closed on September 1, 1963, its 70 patients scattered to nearby rest homes and other institutions. Part of the grounds was sold to Prince George's County Board of Education and in 1965 became a new location for Laurel High School. Demolition The facility ceased operations in September 1963 after the death of Coggins, and the historic structure was eventually demolished by controlled fire in August 1964 to make way for new housing; the Middletown and Avondale high-rise apartments are now there. Upon his death, Coggins willed his considerable fortune to the Keswick nursing home in Baltimore with a stipulation that the bequest be used to build a rehabilitation home for \\"whites-only\\". However, it was determined that the money would go to the University of Maryland Medical Systems as the will did not maintain the same racial clause to this alternative beneficiary.

He settled in Charles Town about 1760, and from 1759 to 1773 he was a major exporter of deerskins supplied by Native American hunters. Gordon also participated in the transatlantic slave trade but was not a major importer of captive Africans. John Gordon did business in Charles Town and Savannah, as well as in British East Florida. The regional network of Scottish traders headed by Gordon in Charles Town, and the brothers John and James Graham in Savannah, served as a liaison between government officials (many of them fellow Scots to whom they were connected politically) and the Indian tribes, primarily the Creeks. Gordon also underwrote the mercantile activities of George Galphin, at that time the wealthiest Indian trader in the Southeast, whose trading firm was predominant in the tribal towns of the Chattahoochee Valley and in Coweta. Early years Fort Frederica, St Simons Island, Georgia Gordon, the son of Mary MacQueen and John Gordon of Aberdeenshire, appears to have come to America in 1736, possibly among the 130 Highland Scots from Inverness aboard the vessel Symond, in the same convoy that brought John Wesley and his brother Charles to America. They were part of the so-called \\"Great Embarkation\\" of settlers recruited to emigrate to the new colony of Georgia founded by General James Oglethorpe. A list of the original settlers of St. Simons Island and the soldiers stationed at Fort Frederica in 1736 includes a John Gordon among those who were both settlers and soldiers. His rank is given as captain in the 1751 marriage records of the register of St. Helena's Parish at Beaufort, South Carolina. Gordon started his entrepreneurial career during King George's War (1740-1748), supplying Oglethorpe's Regiment posted at Fort Frederica. When the regiment disbanded, he moved to South Carolina, and eventually became one of the leading deerskin traders in the colony. Scottish Merchants and the Shaping of Colonial Georgia Paul M. Pressly The Georgia Historical Quarterly Vol. 91, No. 2 (Summer 2007), p. 151 Published by: Georgia Historical Society Economic prospects for the colony of Georgia had improved considerably by 1759; consequently Gordon determined to expand his operations and opened an office in Savannah headed by Thomas Netherclift, the son-in-law of his deceased longtime partner, and channeled a sizeable part of the deerskin trade through that location. There Gordon purchased a wharf lot, invested in local shipyards, and involved himself in regional activities beyond the profitable mercantile trade, including the establishment of several plantations,Pressly 2013, p. 199 among them one on Daufuskie Island in South Carolina. Drawing of James Edward Oglethorpe at Wormslew Historic site, Savannah, Georgia During the 1750s, the firm of Elliott and Gordon was the most active in the trade between Beaufort and Georgia. John Gordon managed its affairs in Beaufort while Grey Elliot, a lawyer and land speculator, ran the Sunbury, Georgia office; the company was dissolved in 1760 when Elliot became the deputy auditor for Georgia. The Beaufort and Georgia trade had made Gordon rich‚Äîhe sold his plantation, advertising his \\"very convenient dwelling house with kitchen, stable, stores and etc., on the Bay in Beaufort\\", and moved to Charles Town with his family. In the 1760s, the colony of South Carolina granted titles to the low-water lots on the south side of Bay Street in Beaufort, usually to merchants like Francis Stuart and John Gordon. Local merchants traded in rice and indigo, and ran dry goods stores to supply the townspeople with necessities. Planters from South Carolina had played a leading role in spreading rice cultivation into Georgia, but with the end of Georgia's prohibition on slavery in 1751, Scottish merchants and Indian traders were pioneers in the introduction of slave-based tidal rice cultivation to Georgia on the Savannah River and other saltwater marshlands. In 1762, Gordon, his partner Grey Elliot of Sunbury, and John Mullyrne purchased a 1300-acre tract of land on Hutchinson Island opposite Savannah, which had sold previously for a few shillings per acre.Scottish Merchants and the Shaping of Colonial Georgia Paul M. Pressly The Georgia Historical Quarterly Vol. 91, No. 2 (Summer 2007), p. 148 Published by: Georgia Historical Society There they developed 800 acres on the Savannah River for rice cultivation.Rowland, 1996, p. 178 Merchant vessels Around the end of 1757, Moses Lindo sold the slaver ship Lindo Packett to John Gordon. A consortium of Charles Town merchants, including John Gordon, bought the 80-ton ship General Wolf of Charles Town, mastered by Resolve Smith. The other investors were John Poaug, John McQueen, John Torrans, and John Greg. The ship had been seized from the French by the English privateer Charming Nelly, commanded by Benjamin Smith. The schooner Tybee was often seen at Port Royal on its regularly commissioned coastal trade runs for Gordon in Beaufort.Rowland, 1996, p. 155 During the Revolutionary War, the patriot Continental Association suspected the brig Beaufort of evading its trade embargo against Great Britain by smuggling South Carolina products to Georgia. In the latter months of 1776, the Beaufort smuggled goods on a regular run to St. Augustine for Gordon's associate, the Loyalist merchant William Panton.Rowland, 1996, p. 206 Land speculation in East Florida Copy of map drawn by John Gordon, showing lands claimed by him and Jesse Fish After the signing of the Treaty of Paris of 1763, and with the impending mass evacuation of the Spaniards in Florida, Gordon recognized an opportunity to acquire lands there, and corresponded with the merchant Jesse Fish of St. Augustine, Florida, about acquiring large tracts from the Spanish landholders, who were anxious to sell. Gordon raised the necessary capital and arrived at that city in August 1763. In September and October of the same year, the two speculators purchased hundreds of thousands of acres from departing Spaniards. The Spanish governor of Florida, Melchor Feliu, was determined to ascertain the validity of all land titles before properties were sold to British subjects. The deeds signed by the Governor and the Royal Treasurer, Juan Esteban de Pe√±a, affirmed that the Spanish owners of the lands had legitimate titles and that according to the Treaty of Paris, Gordon and Fish had become the \\"true and lawful owners and possessors\\" of those lands. The Floridanos, or Spanish citizens of Florida, were allowed by the terms of the Treaty of Paris to sell their property to English subjects within a period of eighteen-months, but few buyers were found, leaving Spanish agents unable to dispose of St. Augustine properties. After the last of the emigrants had left, Juan Jos√© Elixio de la Puente, formerly chief official of the royal accountancy (Oficial mayor de la Royal Contaduria), returned to St. Augustine from Havana with an appointment to dispose of the remaining Spanish property. Because the incoming British soldiers had little money, and civilian settlers hoped to receive outright grants of land from the British Crown,History of St. Augustine - The British and Second Spanish Periods http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00094846/00003/2j p. 2 few of them were interested in acquiring Spanish real estate. Under these conditions and with the uncertainty of future sales, Puente was eventually compelled to transfer all the unsold Spanish property to an agent who would represent its owners. In July 1764, most of the houses, lots, and lands, amounting to almost 200 estates in and around St. Augustine, were conveyed from Puente to Fish. Map drawn by Elixio de la Puente, showing property lots of St. Augustine, 1764 Fish and Gordon were frustrated in their joint land speculations, as their claims were disallowed by British officials. Gordon, then a merchant and slave trader from Charles Town, had formed a partnership with Fish operating as his agent. The two speculators purchased largely from the outgoing Spaniards, but the British authorities refused to allow the deeds to be recorded. These officials disregarded entirely the conveyances of the Catholic church properties, and proceeded to take possession of them in defiance of the provisions of the treaty of 1763. Because the Spanish monarchy had proprietorship rights in the patronato real relationship of church and state, those same prerogatives were claimed in the name of the English monarch, who had assumed sovereignty in Florida. All tierras realengas (royal lands) in St. Augustine, including the church estates, thus reverted to the British Crown. The Catholic Church and the two partners were subsequently required to turn over the buildings and all the land in their transaction to the British government. On orders from England, the Spanish bishop's house was seized for use of the Church of England, and the Convent of St. Francis, which had the best well in the town, was taken to house British troops, extensive barracks being erected on the old foundations. Early attempts to colonize British East Florida were hindered, particularly in St. Augustine, the capital of the province, by speculators like Jesse Fish and John Gordon, who held such great tracts of land. Fish and Gordon claimed ownership of a huge section of 4,600,000 acres on both banks of the St. Johns River, as far south as Ponce de Leon Inlet and westward as far as Alachua, and including a considerable portion of the Tampa Bay area. The Commissioners for Trade and Plantations rejected the validity of Fish and Gordon's \\"pretended purchase\\", telling their agents it was inconsistent with the spirit of the Treaty. Governor James Grant refused to confirm their grants and distributed the property to actual settlers. Years later, after many applications, broadsides initiated through the popular press in America and in England, the intervention of influential friends in London, and a voyage to England in 1772 to press his case, where he asserted that he was \\"legally empowered to transact all matters relative to their joint purchase\\", John Gordon eventually obtained some compensation, apparently remitting Fish's share.Gordon 1772, p.18 Scottish trade network James Spalding from Perthshire, Scotland, and now of Frederica town on St. Simon's Island, operated two Indian trading stores on the St. Johns River, one on the east bank, and another on the west bank. He and his partner Roger Kelsall bought many of their goods through John Gordon in Charleston and merchant Basil Cowper in Savannah. Spalding and Kelsall, like many of their fellow traders, as well as Gordon and Cowper, were loyal to Great Britain. Panton, Leslie and Company, later the most well-known of the Creek trading firms, took over the Spalding and Kelsall stores when the two merchants emigrated to the Bahamas following the American Revolution. After 1768, when the British military posts at Picolata and San Marcos de Apalache (St. Mark's) were abandoned, John Gordon enlisted the aid of the Governor of East Florida, James Grant, and the Indian Superintendent, John Stuart, in setting up George Galphin's traders at those locations. Gordon's warehouse supplied their stores, and his vast trade network in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida laid the foundation of Panton, Leslie, and Company, which would become the largest mercantile company on the southern frontier.Rowland 1996, p. 182 William Panton and John Forbes had done business with Spalding and his partners before 1776 through Gordon's Charleston firm. Panton served as Gordon's clerk from 1765 until 1772, when Gordon appointed him one of his attorneys, and Forbes was Gordon's maternal nephew. Panton and Forbes were two of the founding partners of Panton, Leslie and Company. Cultural pursuits Gordon had his country seat at Belvedere, a plantation outside the city proper, where he lived with his family when not at his townhouse in Charles Town. He speaks of the botanist John Bartram and his son William having visited the city on their travels in the southern provinces, and of his giving them letters of introduction to a friend who could smooth their passage among the Creek and Chickasaw Indians \\"when passing through the Indian towns of those savage countries.\\" In a letter dated Charleston, January 4, 1765, he mentions Lord Adam Gordon being present, and his interest in botanical matters. John Gordon and Lord Adam Gordon seem to have been related, perhaps as cousins by their descent through the Gordons of Aberdeenshire. However, an entry Lord Adam made at Charlestown on 9 December 1764, in a notebook he kept on his tour of the British American colonies, refers to John Gordon, Esq., as his \\"worthy landlord and friend\\", but makes no mention of such a familial relationship, although it takes notice of John Gordon's two daughters. In the journal he compiled of his travels in America, Lord Adam briefly describes the land claimed by John Gordon around Tampa Bay, and alludes to the possibility of creating a cross-Florida waterway from the Gulf of Mexico to the St. Johns River. Gordon served as president of the Charles Town St. Cecilia Society, an organization formed to support the performance of musical recitals, including the hiring of musicians. The first St. Cecilia Society advertisement to recruit musicians appeared in The South Carolina and American General Gazette of 10‚Äì17 April 1771. The text is dated 11 April. Family Picture, c. 1863, of two-story tabby house built by John Gordon at the corner of Carteret and Bay Streets in Beaufort, South Carolina John Gordon married Elizabeth Wright, his first wife, in St. Helena's Parish Church at Beaufort in 1751. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah; their two other children died in infancy. His eldest daughter, Elizabeth Gordon, married Joseph Smith, a son of William Smith, Justice of the Supreme Court of New York, in New York in 1770. On March 10, 1767, Gordon married his second wife, Catherine Smith (1743‚Äì1775), a daughter of the same William Smith. She died December 8, 1776 and was buried in the graveyard of the Circular Church in Charleston. After her death in 1775, Gordon returned to Great Britain with his children, and died in 1788 at Bordeaux, France, where he had accompanied an invalid relative. His younger children resided with and were reared by their father's family. Two of his three daughters by Catherine, i.e., Mary and Jane, married the brothers, James and Edwin Gairdner, and had issue. John Gordon's only son to survive infancy was Adam Gordon (1770‚Äì1841), borne by his second wife, Catherine. Adam was educated at the private school of Dr. John Carr in Hertford, worked for the Colonial Office in London and married Amelia Watts, dying without issue in Manchester Square, Middlesex, April 1841. John Gordon died at Bordeaux on March 4, 1778, while his wife Catherine had died on December 15, 1775. Gordon's will, dated 28 July 1774, in Bristol, left \\"all and singular his lands in East Florida\\" to William Greenwood and William Higginson, two merchants of London. They were entrusted to pursue his long-standing claim for compensation from the Crown for those lands, and to use the proceeds to settle his debts to the estate of John Macqueen, deceased, and others. Greenwood and Higginson were appointed executors. A codicil to the will, dated 4 December 1777, at Westminster, gave his two daughters by his first marriage, Elizabeth and Sarah, a tract of land in Prince William Parish in South Carolina, and one hundred pounds sterling to his sister-in-law Margaret Smith. The legatees in trust, John Smith of Georgia and Thomas Forbes of Charles Town, were charged with selling the estate to pay his debts, and the rest to be divided between his children Mary, Adam, Caroline and Jane. He appointed John Smith, Thomas Forbes, William Panton, and John Torrans his executors in America, and joined Grey Elliott, formerly of Georgia, and now of Knightsbridge, county Middlesex, with Greenwood and Higginson as executors in Great Britain only.

B. Smoove, and Rick Shapiro. Many other comedians and comedy actors appear in the film, such as Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, Amy Poehler (in her first film appearance), and Conan O'Brien. Plot Charles is the misanthropic obsessive-compulsive owner of a photo shop. He lives alone, and at night sexually gratifies himself by sitting in a bowl of ice cream. One day, Charles notices an abundance of photos he has developed that have not been picked up. He begins to call each customer to remind them to pick up their photos. One of these customers is Florence, an elderly woman who is tormented by her gambling-addicted husband Lester. She longs for her son Willie, who joined the army two decades ago but has not returned any of her letters; although in fact, the dim-witted Willie does not realize that he is on the end of a cruel joke played by the Army mail-room workers who have not given him any of his mother's letters over the past twenty years or sent his. Charles decides to seek companionship; he attempts to date an aggressively sexual prostitute named Lola Vagina but finds her too extroverted. When he realizes that the final two packages of photographs in his store belong to Florence and another mysterious customer who will not pick up their phone, he visits Florence himself to deliver her photographs. After meeting her, Charles is attracted to her extreme cleanliness, and visits her the next day to ask to marry her. Florence, however, explains that her husband will never allow a divorce, but Charles asks to speak with him. That night, Lester finally wins on a horse race but is attacked and killed by a pack of wild dogs while walking home with his winnings. Charles and Florence wed. After returning from their honeymoon in Florida, Florence discovers him sitting in ice cream. She is disgusted, but allows him to continue if he agrees to adopt a son with her. They successfully adopt Clean, a teenage African-American delinquent. Shortly after, Willie returns home and joins their family as well. That night, Florence says that she is happier than she has ever been; the next morning, Charles then asks for a divorce, but finds that Florence has died. He leaves, and Willie becomes Clean's new father. He returns to his photo shop, where he finds the last package of photos left by a customer who did not leave his name or address. Charles attempts to call him again, but finds the number is not listed. Finally, he opens the envelope, and finds a series of photographs of random places and people. He comes to a photo of himself inspecting those photos, while the next photo is of his dead body shortly after. The film closes on Charles' terrified eyes, while Lester's laughing and dog growls are heard. Cast * Chuck Sklar as Charles * Martha Greenhouse as Florence * J. B.

On the first day of shooting, a crew member used the wrong type of film stock in the camera, and various other problems caused the first three days' footage to be unusable. In April 1997, C.K. found himself running out of money to complete production. On April 9, 1997, C.K. appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, showed a clip of Tomorrow Night, and made a \\"tongue-in- cheek entreaty for funds\\" to finish the film. C.K.'s friends Jon Stewart, Denis Leary, Brett Butler, Spike Feresten, Chris Rock lent him money to help finish the project, which ended up costing around $180,000 in total. Before he was finishing with the editing process, C.K. appeared on Oddville, MTV on September 2, 1997, to discuss the upcoming film. Release Tomorrow Night premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 1998.

By the mid-1980s, anti-Japanese sentiment in Detroit had decreased. The level had especially decreased among young working age people. Leaders in government and business had toned down remarks regarding Japan. Japanese cars became increasingly common in Detroit, including within blue collar communities. In 1991, Sharon Cohen of the Associated Press wrote that anti-Japanese sentiment had largely decreased from 1981 and American automobile industry trade union members were working for Japanese companies. She added that \\"Japan-bashing\\" still occurred in Metro Detroit, with politicians and Iacocca making public statements against the Japanese automobile industry. Mazda's operation at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, was the first Japanese auto operation in the U.S. industrial heartland. In 1991 the plant had 250 Japanese employees out of its total of 3,600 employees. In a ten-year period ending in 1992, the Japanese population in Metro Detroit had tripled. Sharon Cohen wrote in a 1991 Associated Press article that \\"The Japanese community [in all of Michigan] is tiny and transient: estimates range from 6,000 to 8,000.\\" In 1990, there were 3,500 Japanese expatriates in Metro Detroit.

By 1990, Chrysler was purchasing steel from Mitsui which had an office in Southfield. By 1990, since the number of Japanese companies with Detroit branches had increased to almost 300, with most of them related to the automobile industry, major accounting firms including the \\"Big Six\\" hired Japanese employees and catered to the new Japanese business populations. For the same reason, Dickinson, Wright, Moon, Van Dusen & Freeman, one of the largest law firms in Detroit, hired Japanese employees. Area hospitals began catering to Japanese patients. A hotel in Novi, the Sheraton Oaks, hired a \\"director of Japan marketing\\". By 1990, the Saturday Japanese school operated in three locations. In the 1990s, several Japanese automobile firms had opened offices along M-14. Nissan Motor Co. opened its Farmington Hills office in November 1991.

Japanese American Citizens League Detroit Chapter  Founded on June 17, 1946, the Detroit chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) began its mission to ‚Äúfulfill the Japanese community‚Äôs unique needs as a small, displaced group in a new community‚Äù after moving to Detroit post World War II relocation camps. Led by Peter Fujioka, the chapter's first president, the Detroit chapter collaborated with chapters nationwide to form the Midwest District Council. However, the mission of the national JACL during World War II and the mission post the war are vastly different. The Japanese American Citizens League was founded in 1929 with a goal of improving the image of Japanese Americans following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In the early 1940s, the JACL joined the United States government, FBI, and the Office of Naval Intelligence to identify disloyal Japanese Americans. The JACL wanted to improve the image of Nisei, second- generation Japanese Americans and reported those who resisted. With the JACL becoming such an exclusive organization, many Japanese opposed the organization completely and it received harsh criticism for its role during the war. After the war, the JACL nationwide began to support changing laws regarding citizenship, equal rights, and abolishing derogatory terms. Along with legal action, the JACL aided with gaining monetary reparations for those who experienced the camps, as well as land reparations and relocation assistance. In the early 1950s, the chapter and the national JACL began its efforts to support the Japanese American community by campaigning Congress to pass the McCarran-Walter Omnibus Immigration and Naturalization Bill. The bill eliminated racial restrictions on immigration and naturalization, granting citizenship to immigrants and also removed the exclusion ban on Asian immigrants, providing them with a quota. With the support of the chapter, the bill was passed and allowed Issei, first-generation Japanese, to become American citizens. Detroit also played a large role in advocating for scholarships and loans for Japanese American students. The chapter became a ‚Äúbeneficiary of a $10,000 Educational Loan Fund from the Detroit JACLer Taizo Kokubo‚Äù. A second fund was created under the Educational Loan Fund for $20,000 to build the Japanese Room at Wayne State University in the 1980s. The fund still exists today and remains a main source of loans and scholarships for college students. One of the main achievements of the Detroit JACL is the many events that they host, including the 18th Biennial National JACL Convention in Detroit in 1964. In addition, the chapter hosted the a convention in 1968 which conducted an oratorical contest for young adults, ‚ÄúWhat Evacuation Means to Me.‚Äù With hosting events, came increased involvement with the Detroit Far Eastern festivals in the 1970s. Other events the chapter embarked upon include hosting Japanese language and cooking classes, forming an education and building committee, starting a bowling league, and creating discussions about redress, reparations given to the Japanese for relief. In working with other ethnic groups, the chapter played ‚Äúa major role in the formation and operation of these festivals for nearly ten years‚Äù. These festivals included cultural festivals across the nation including the well-known Cherry Festival and other holiday festivals. Close connections formed and eventually laid the foundation for contributing to multi-ethnic associations such as the American Citizens for Justice. Later, in the 1980s, the JACL worked closely with the American Citizens for Justice during the case involving the murder of Vincent Chin. The Detroit JACL‚Äôs work continued into the 1990s when the Civil Rights Act of 1990 was passed and authorized ‚Äú$20,000 redress payments to former internees of the World War II Relocation Center‚Äù. Moving to Detroit was difficult, ‚Äúthe Japanese population arrived here in the mid-1940s with fresh memories of wartime internment in federal detention camps‚Äù. Recollections of the camps were vivid, as Kaz Mayeda the head of Michigan‚Äôs Japanese American Citizen‚Äôs League committee of reparations recalls that \\"'As a 14-year-old, it was a lark for me‚Ä¶ But the older people who were just starting to establish themselves were crushed. Their property was expropriated. They lost everything'‚Äù. After coming to Detroit, James Shimoura recalls that ‚Äúthe FBI used to park a car outside our home every day and keep track of everyone who came in or left the house‚Äù. Discrimination was clear and the JACL had a large role in creating a community and attempting to disarm that discrimination. Elaine Prout said, ‚ÄúI think there will always be a need for JACL because there‚Äôll always be discrimination‚Äù. The chapter started a letter-writing campaign requesting support for the full and timely distribution of funds for the redress payments. Today, the chapter continues its work by ‚Äúproviding a forum for educating school and church groups about the WWII internment experiences of Japanese-Americans‚Äù. The JACL is continuing to make an impactful difference today and the Detroit chapter is still active. As the mission statement for the Detroit Chapter states ‚Äúthe JACL Detroit Chapter has been committed to aiding and celebrating the Japanese American community in Michigan since 1946‚Äù therefore making a significant impact of the lives of Japanese Americans in Detroit. Lifestyle By 1999, many male employees of Japanese companies are sent to live in Oakland County in Metro Detroit for three- to five-year periods, taking their wives and families with them, before returning to Japan. By 1992, most women in Japanese companies did not hold job types or a high enough rank to be sent to the United States, so few professional Japanese women were sent to Metro Detroit. In 1992, most of the Japanese women residing here were homemakers who stayed at home. By this time, many of the women, despite language barriers, had formed social networks in the United States. The Japanese Society of Detroit Women's Club (JSD„Ç¶„Ç£„É°„É≥„Ç∫„ÇØ„É©„Éñ JSD Wimenzukurabu) was formed in May 1991 and in March 1992 it had 230 members.

The current distribution of the Franco- American ethnic group in the United States today The Franco-Americans, or French Americans, are a group of people of French, French-Canadian, and Acadian descent living in the United States. Today there are 11.8 million Franco-Americans in the US and 1.6 million Franco-Americans who speak French at home. There are also an additional 450,000 Americans who speak a French- based creole language, for example, Haitian Creole. Even though Franco- Americans are a substantial portion of the US population, they are generally less visible than other sizable ethnic groups. This is partly because of geographical dispersal (there are many regionally unique Franco-American groups, e.g. Louisiana Creole), and partly because a large proportion of Franco-Americans have acculturated or assimilated. Early Franco-American settlers The flag of the Midwest Franco-Americans The Franco-Americans were never part of the Franco-American alliance, an alliance made between Louis XVI and the United States during the American Revolutionary War. Original settlers Most Modern-day Franco-Americans of French Canadian or French heritage are the descendants of settlers who lived in Canada during the 17th century (Canada was known as New France at that time), Canada then came to be known as Province of Qu√©bec in 1763, which then renamed to Lower Canada in 1791, and then to the Canadian Province of Qu√©bec after the Canadian Confederation was formed in 1867. The majority of Franco-Americans of French Canadian origin, mostly the ones living in New England and the Mid-West, are those whose origins trace back to that of the Quebec Diaspora, also, not that many Franco-Americans are of Acadian descent, who came to the US from the Canadian Maritime regions. What is unusual about the early Franco-Americans is that they arrived before the formation of the United States. In the time before the American Revolutionary War, they founded many villages and cities and were some of the first Europeans to settle down in the US. Places that were main settlements for Franco-American settlers include the Midwest and Louisiana. Franco-Americans today are found mostly in New England and in the northern sections of New York, the Midwest and Louisiana. There are three main types of French-American; French Canadian, Cajun, or Louisiana Creole .http://francoamericanarchives.org/about-nous-autres/franco-american- history/franco-american-americain/#sthash.oKYIDHuL.dpuf Louisiana During the period of French colonization in the Americas (1534-1763), France divided up all of its land into five territories; Canada, Acadia, Hudson Bay, Newfoundland and Louisiana. The Treaty of Utrecht seized France's control over Acadia, Newfoundland and Hudson Bay. After this treaty the colony of Cape Breton Island was established as the successor to Acadia. By 1679, La Louisiane fran√ßaise or French Louisiana was an administrative district of New France. Under French control from 1682‚Äì1762 and 1802‚Äì04, the area was named after Louis XIV, by French explorer Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle. It initially covered a vast territory that included most of the drainage basin of the Mississippi River and stretched from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Appalachian Mountains to the Rocky Mountains. Louisiana was split up into two regions, known as Upper Louisiana, Upper Louisiana's land began north of the Arkansas River, and Lower Louisiana. The modern U.S. state of Louisiana is after the historical region, although it occupies only a small portion of what it originally was meant to have. French pioneers explored the area began during the reign of King Louis XIV, while French Louisiana was not greatly developed, due to the deficiency of human and financial resources. As the result of France's defeat in the Seven Years' War, France was forced, in 1763, to relinquish the eastern part of the territory to the victorious British, and the western regions to Spain as compensation for Spain's loss of Florida. Direct French colonization ended with this transfer of authority, but Louisiana nevertheless remained a refuge for forcibly displaced Acadians, who were dispersed across the Thirteen Colonies. This population became what we know as the Cajuns. France regained sovereignty of the western territory in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800. But, strained by obligations in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte decided to sell the territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, ending France's presence in Louisiana. North American Franco-American colonies In 1562 French naval officer Jean Ribault sailed with his fleet to the New World to found Fort Caroline, which is now Jacksonville, Florida. Fort Caroline was a haven for Huguenot culture (French Protestant). The Spanish, seeing the danger of these Protestant colonists killed Ribault and many of his followers in 1565. Stopped by the French government from establishing colonies in New France, a group of Huguenots, led by Jess√© de Forest, sailed to North America and settled in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later part of New York and New Jersey), as well as several British colonies including Nova Scotia. A number of New Amsterdam's main families were of Huguenot origin. In 1628 the Huguenots established a church congregation called L'√âglise fran√ßaise √† la Nouvelle-Amsterdam. Having arrived in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were granted land directly across from the Manhattan settlers on Long Island for a permanent settlement and they also settled near the harbor Newtown Creek, they were the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, then known as Boschwick, and today the neighborhood known as Bushwick. Later Franco-Americans=Causes of the Quebec diaspora The Loyalist diaspora was the main cause for the Quebec diaspora. Following the defeat of Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War, colonists loyal to the British crown were punished. Many families were expelled and exiled from the newly created United States because they had been consistently loyal to Great Britain and they refused to swear allegiance to the United States and they also refused to give up now American lands. Some were also punished because they did not obey the new laws of the United States. Due to this, British Loyalists had to flee the US and take refuge in Canada. Canada now had to support 50,000 refugees. Over 32,000 Loyalists fled New York for Nova Scotia and an additional 13,000 took refuge in Quebec, Canada at the time had a population of just over 70,000, most being French-Canadian. The British, as they ruled Canada, valued their own countrymen more than the Francophone population, and they needed land for the refugees. As Nova Scotia took in most of the refugees, the sheer upkeep of most of the new arrivals would mean political tension in the colonies. The territory of New Scotia was divided in two and Loyalists were allowed full authority of their territory which was known as New Brunswick. Meanwhile, in Quebec (which was known as just Canada during the second half of the 18th century) the authorities feared that riots and tension would occur if the Loyalists settled in French-Canadian communities.http://provincequebec.com/history-of-quebec/loyalist-diaspora/ Governor Haldimand thus relocated many newcomers to settle in the region of the Great Lakes, which was considered part of Quebec and thus under French law. The new arrivals did not like the legal system, so Canada was divided into two main regions; Upper Canada and Lower Canada, the other names for these regions were Ontario and Quebec. The British parliament approved of this division of Canada in 1791 and by 1792 it came into practice. In Quebec, Loyalists could petition for land as long as they demonstrated that they had suffered for their continuous loyalty to Britain in the United States. They also needed to gather a group of colonists together and get them to swear fealty to the British crown and they had to promise to develop the land they were granted. Once they were given land, they were expected to build roads, mills and to survey the neighboring settlements and overlook nearby and close regions at their own expense. The only problems at first for these new settlers were the black flies and mosquitoes that infested the land granted to them by the British crown. Wolves were also a big problem for farmers. The first harvests were poor and were barely enough to meet local demand. The farmers had very little to sell to the public. Small villages set up would sometimes die out and settlers would have to emigrate to another settlement. The borders between Canada and the United States was not definite until 1842. Border conflicts between Canadian settlers and the US army were constant. Sometimes, American invasions would take place in 1838 during the Fenians Uprisals. By the middle 19th century some Loyalists began to emigrate out of Canada, seeking to colonize the Midwest of America. The Quebec diaspora The current flag of Quebec The Quebec diaspora, often called \\"grande saign√©e\\" (the great demographic hemorrhage), was a period of mass immigration of inhabitants of Quebec dispersing across North America. The Canadian immigrants emigrated to New England and the American Midwest, Ontario, and the Canadian Prairies. This phase of migration started in 1840 and ended with the Great Depression in the 1930s. This chapter of Franco-American history has been surveyed and detailed by historians , , and Armand Chartier. Immigration to the United States Due to a sudden growth in population, families could not support themselves due to law and systems, but also because the new British leaders of Canada reserved land for the English and English systems of colonization, not to mention there was also the \\"Ch√¢teau Clique\\" which ruled the Province of Quebec blocking expansion of housing and land development, French Canadians did not have enough room to live in. New England was industrializing, approximately 900,000 French-Canadians who lived in Quebec (some were of other French origins e.g. Acadian) left Quebec to go and find a job in the United States. Only around 50% of the migrants reported returning to Canada. The French-Canadians and other Frenchmen who stayed got together to form communities known as \\"Little Canadas\\". A vast number of Americans with French ancestry trace it back to Quebec. Other Franco-Americans, particularly the ones from the South, were originally from Acadia - the Cajuns - and there were a few from France directly. Up until the year 1849, the Catholic Church was not allowed to purchase any additional land, or found any parishes in the Eastern Townships due to English Protestant laws and control. By orders of Father Bernard O'Reilley, an Association des Townships was founded in 1848 to promote settlement in the area of Canada. In the 1850s, the association bought lands which were then given to young families of farmers to prevent them from leaving for the United States where it was believed they would ultimately be assimilated. Many American textile manufactures and other industries opened up jobs for French-Canadian immigrants, such as ones in Lewiston and other bordering counties in Maine; Fall River, Holyoke and Lowell in Massachusetts; Woonsocket in Rhode Island; Manchester in New Hampshire and the bordering regions in Vermont. There were also many French-Canadian immigrants who moved to the Kankakee, IL area from the 1830s through the 1870s, including religious missionaries, establishing communities such as Bourbonnais, St. Anne, St. Georges, Papineau, and L'Erable. There are also vast populations of French- Canadian descent in Michigan and Minnesota ‚Äî who began emigrating there when the region was still part of New France. The Museum of Work and Culture in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, explains and details New England's Quebec diaspora which developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Notable Americans of French-Canadian descent include writer Jack Kerouac, politician Mike Gravel, singers Rudy Vall√©e and Robert Goulet, Emil Beaulieau, historian Will Durant and many others.http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Quebec+diaspora Newspapers Due to the Quebec diaspora many French-Canadians left Quebec to go and live in the United States and other North-American countries and regions. These immigrants not only brought with them the French language, but religion and tradition. Many newspaper companies were founded and there are still some that exist today.

Ganor (; born 1950) is an Israeli entrepreneur and artist known mainly for his role as one of the world's first VoIP pioneers. He served as Chairman and CEO of VocalTec Ltd (Nasdaq CALL), the company behind the creation of ‚ÄúInternet Phone‚Äù, the world's first commercial software product that enabled voice communication over the internet, known initially as ‚ÄúInternet Telephony‚Äù and later as VoIP. Biography=Early life and career Elon Ganor was born in Geneva, Switzerland in 1964, grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel where he graduated from Tel Aviv University Sackler Medical school and got an MD in 1975. Entrepreneurship career After years of practicing medicine Ganor shifted his energy to the creation of technology related companies. His first company was Virovahl S,A- a Swiss-based biotechnology company that he founded in 1987 with a group of Swedish virologists. The company's laboratory was located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Virovahl SA developed the world's first HIV synthetic peptide based on diagnostic test. Under his guidance as President of Virovahl, the test was licensed exclusively to Pharmacia AB from Uppsala, Sweden (later merged with Upjohn). In 1990 Ganor joined forces with Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty who had formed VocalTec Ltd six months earlier in Israel. Cohen and Haramaty developed and manufactured a PC sound card (SpeechBoard TM) that was sold mainly to the local visually impaired community in Israel with a unique Text to Speech software enabling blind people to use a computer in the Hebrew language. Since that market was limited, as VocalTec CEO and Chairman, Ganor decided to shift the company's focus to software. In 1993 VocalChat was born, a software that enabled voice communication from one PC to another on a local and wide area network. The software was developed by a group of developers including Ofer Kahana (later the founder of Kagoor that was sold to Juniper), Elad Sion (served in Israel TOP 8200 Intelligence army unit, died young in a car accident), Ofer Shem Tov (a software developer in Israel) and others. The software was presented in Atlanta in May 1993 at the Network InterOp trade show. In 1994, support for Internet Protocol was added and on Friday, February 10, 1995 ‚ÄúInternet Phone‚Äú was launched with a near full page Wall Street Journal article by WSJ Boston Correspondent Bill Bulkeley, ‚ÄúHello World! Audible chats On the Internet‚Äù was the header. VocalTec Ltd became a Nasdaq traded company exactly one year later in February 1996 with Ganor as its Chairman & CEO. In 1997 Ganor, with the help of Michael Spencer (at the time Principal at Booz Allen Hamilton who led the Internet Strategy Group of the Communications, Media and Technology practice) wrote the business plan for a new type of a VoIP exchange phone company. After meeting Tom Evslin from AT&T; (who led at the time WorldNet AT&T; ISP initiative), ITXC was founded, with Tom Evslin as its CEO and cofounder. VocalTec under Ganor invested the initial $500,000 and gave a credit of $1 million in VoIP Gateway equipment in exchange for 19.9% of the new company; AT&T; followed with an additional investment. ITXC became the world's largest VoIP carrier, reaching a market cap of about $8 billion as a Nasdaq company in 2000 (prior to the March 2008 crash). In 2008 Ganor became the founder, investor and CEO (with Danny Frumkin, PhD and Adam Wasserstrom, PhD as co-founders) of Nucleix. Nucleix Ltd is a Biotechnology epigenetic company involved in unique development of bio- markers and technologies for forensic medicine. The company developed a product for the authentication of DNA. Art career Ganor left VocalTec in 2006 to enroll back to school to study art at Midrasha Leomanut Beit Berl, Israel. He graduated in 2008 with photography being his main passion and focus. Among his works, ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äù a series of staged photographs shot in New York and Israel expressing criticism of Wall Street practices (first exhibited in 2008 just before the Lehman Bros collapse). Also among other series, ‚ÄúThe Box‚Äù (exhibited in 2009 at Volta show in Switzerland) and Earl King (exhibited in October 2010). Ganor‚Äôs art is present in many art collections including the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Shpilman institute Photography collection, was presented by the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and many private collections.

It was constructed during the early 3rd century. History Caracalla arch, 1860‚Äì1890 The arch was built between 211 and 214 by means of a testamentary donation of Gaius Cornelius Egrilianus, Prefect of the XIV legion, who was originally from Thebeste.The inscription that records this information is inscribed on the inside of the northwest pylon: Accame 1938, p.247. The figure set aside for the construction was 250,000 sesterti.Bacchielli 1987, citato in bibliografia. Later, the arch was reused as the northern gate of the city wall in the Byzantine period. The lateral arches were walled up, as was the northern one, until they were reopened by French military engineers during the colonial period. Description Arch of Caracalla at Thebeste In form, the Arch of Caracalla is roughly cubical, being 10.94m on the side and to the top of the entablature. On the pylons, beside the spans are pairs of columns with Corinthian capitals, detached from the wall and with pilasters behind, supported by a podium from which their pedestals extend. The main entablature is above the pairs of columns and continues in the recess above the spans. Medallions with the busts of divinities are located above each of the spans. On the attic on three sides dedications are inscribed to the deified Emperor Septimius Severus, Julia Domna and Caracalla. On the fourth side is a reconstructed Byzantine inscription, originally found in the infill of the vaults, which refers to the incorporation of the arch into the Byzantine city wall as the work of the magister militum Solomon.Zanini 2000, cited in the bibliography. At the centre on all sides, the entablature supported an aedicula which held a statue. The reconstruction of the very top of the arch is the subject of some debate among scholars: According to MeunierMeunier 1938, cited in bibliography an octagonal lantern would have stood there with its base hidden by the aediculae, while according to another there would have been a low dome. According to Bacchielli,Bacchielli 1987, cited in bibliography. the four aediculae, connected by railings contained the statues of the Deified Septimius Severus, the Deified Julia Domna, Caracalla and Geta.

Morisawa was an integral part of the revolution in the field that began in the 1950s. She studied the geomorphology of rivers, active fault zones, plate tectonics, coastal geomorphology, geological hazards, and environmental geomorphology. Early life and education Morisawa was born on November 2, 1919 and died in a single-car accident on June 10, 1994. She was born in Toledo, Ohio to a Japanese father and an American mother. She earned a B.S. in mathematics from Hunter College in 1941, with a minor in chemistry. She then earned an M.A. in theology before turning to geology and obtaining an M.S. from University of Wyoming in 1952. She taught at Bryn Mawr College from 1955 to 1959. In 1960 she earned her Ph.D. from Columbia University. Arthur Newell Strahler was the advisor for her doctoral work on the quantitative geomorphology of Pennsylvania streams. Morisawa's desire to understand the natural world becomes apparent when considering her varied academic pursuits. She had a love for plants, animals, the beauty and aesthetic value of landscapes.  Career  Morisawa became an assistant professor in 1959 at the University of Montana. After that from 1961 to 1962 she was employed in Washington, D.C by the U.S. Geological Survey. She continued her career as a professor from 1963 to 1969 at Antioch College. Morisawa was the councillor for the Geological Society of America and the American Quaternary Association. As well, Morisawa was the chair member for the Quaternary Geology and Geomorphology Division of the Geological Society of America multiple times. Due to Marie‚Äôs national and international reputations, scientists from all over the world congregated to Binghamton for their sabbatical studies. In 1987-1988 she had a Fulbright Award to lecture in India. She became a geologist-in-residence in 1990 at Carlton after being sought after by multiple universities. In Binghamton, she donated her services by helping in the managing of the environment. This continued service led to Morisawa being a key contributor in writing master plan for the Town of Vestal, New York. Morisawa joined her discipline in 1960, at that time few women were involved in research and university-level science teaching. She was the first female chair of the QG&G; division (quaternary geology & geomorphology), and mentored younger scientists all throughout her career. During her career in Binghamton, New York, Morisawa always kept the door open for her students to join lunches where discussions took place on the different factors of the state of geology as well as geomorphology. Marie loved to teach and engage with her students on geological discussions. Morisawa wrote eight books, including Evaluating Riverscapes in 1971. She founded the journal Geomorphology in 1986 and was its editor in chief. She became \\"the first female chair\\" of the Quaternary Geology and Geomorphology Division of the Geological Society of America and helped found \\"the annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposia.\\" To recognize her research and educational achievements she received the Outstanding Educator Award from the Association of Women Geoscientists in 1992.  Research  Marie Morisawa was part of the geomorphology revolution in the 1950s and 1960s. This work involves measuring both slopes and stream channels and understanding the relationship they have on larger scale impacts. Marie worked on talus slopes in the Rocky Mountains doing research involving geomorphology. Morisawa was also one of the founders of environmental geomorphology. Geomorphic changes caused by the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake in Montana played a significant role in the start of her research. The earthquake remains provided an ideal outdoor laboratory for Morisawa‚Äôs studies on the initiation of drainage systems. This work produced several abstracts including the 1964 article publication in the American Journal of Science. In 1976 Morisawa presented her research on riverscape preferences at the first northeastern women‚Äôs geoscientists conference at St. Lawrence University. Her research determined which characteristics of riverscapes are valued by certain demographics of the population through a ratings system that determined factors of beauty. Morisawa furthered her research on watersheds and geomorphology, publishing the article Quantitative Geomorphology of Some Watersheds in the Appalachian Plateau. Her research included looking at the geologic structure of the watershed basins in the Appalachian Plateau, and how other interactions affect the streamflow and geomorphology of the basins. The stratigraphy or specifically sequence stratigraphy of basins include anticlines that have been eroded over time and the outer edges of the basin defined with steep scarps. The strata in these basins change over time and these changes can affect direction or velocity of streamflow.  Grants and awards  Throughout the years, Morisawa received many grants, following the successful geomorphic and geological research she produced. Organizations such as: The National Science Foundation, The US Department of Commerce Sea Grant Program, The United States Geological Survey, Ford Foundation, and The Office of Water Resources provided the funding Morisawa required to continue her research.

Commissioned in 1865, she spent the bulk of her career with the Mediterranean Squadron (), often serving as a flagship. The ironclad played a minor role in the Franco- Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, blockading the North Sea coast of Prussia. Provence was decommissioned after the war, but was reactivated in late 1875. She was assigned to the Eastern Mediterranean in early 1879 and became flagship of the Levant Naval Division () later that year. The ship was condemned in 1886 and became a target ship until she was sold for scrap in 1893. Design and description Right elevation line drawing of the class; the shaded area shows the armor protection The Provence class was designed as an enlarged version of the s with thicker armor, more powerful guns, and better seakeeping qualities.

Armament and protection The main battery of the Provence class was intended to be thirty 30-pounder Mod√®le 1858‚Äì60 rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns, but the first two ships to be completed, Provence and , were armed with a mix of ten 50-pounder smoothbore guns, twenty-two 164.7 mm Mod√®le 1864 RMLs and a pair of RMLKonstam, p. 20 Paixhans guns. By 1869‚Äì1870, Provence had been equipped with eight Mod√®le 1864 RMLs and four 194 mm Mod√®le 1864 weapons serving as chase guns. From the upper deck down to below the waterline, the sides of the ships were completely armored with of wrought iron, backed by of wood. The sides of the battery itself were protected with of armor that was backed by of wood. The conning tower's sides consisted of armor plates. Construction and service Provence, named after the historic province,Silverstone, p. 108 was ordered on 16 November 1860 from the Arsenal de Toulon, laid down in March 1861 and launched on 29 October 1863. She was commissioned for trials on 25 February 1864 and was completed the following month, although the frigate was not definitively commissioned () until 1 February 1865. Provence was assigned to the Squadron of Evolutions () of the Mediterranean Squadron. In May the ship escorted Emperor Napoleon III during an official visit to French Algeria.Roche, p. 366 The Mediterranean Squadron sailed to Brest in August to rendezvous with the Northern Squadron () for maneuvers. Before they began, however, the Mediterranean Squadron hosted a visit by the British Channel Fleet on 21‚Äì24 August. The combined squadrons visited Portsmouth a few days later and remained until 2 September, their crews visiting the dockyard, each other's ships and participating in multiple balls and banquets.Jones, pp. 35‚Äì40 Provence was present when a statue of Vice Admiral () Pierre Andr√© de Suffren was unveiled at Saint-Tropez on 4 April 1866. During the Third Italian War of Independence later that year, she ferried General Edmond Le B≈ìuf throughout the Adriatic Sea from 16 July to 20 October. The ship became the flagship of Rear Admiral () Louis Pierre Alexis Pothuau in March 1868. When the Franco-Prussian War began on 19 July 1870, the French had lost track of a squadron of four Prussian ironclads so the Mediterranean Squadron was deployed to Oran, French Algeria, to intercept them in case they attempted to interdict the troop convoys between French North Africa and Metropolitan France. When they received word that the Prussian ships had returned to Germany, the squadron sailed to Brest to prepare to blockade the coast of Prussia. Provence was assigned to Vice Admiral L√©on Martin Fourichon's squadron that was tasked to blockade German ports in the Heligoland Bight. It departed Brest on 8 August and arrived off the British- owned island of Heligoland three days later. The neutral British denied the French permission to re-coal there and the ships were forced to perform it at sea under dangerous conditions. Bad weather and a series of storms beginning in late August prevented the squadron from coaling and the ships were forced to return to France in early September. By then the Prussians were besieging Paris and many of the trained gunners aboard the squadron were transferred to defend the city. The squadron resumed the blockade with reduced crews until December when smaller ships took it over.Wilson, pp. 275‚Äì276, 278 Provence was paid off on 5 April 1871 and disarmed later that month although she was used from trials 18 March 1872‚Äì1873 before being reduced to reserve the following year. The ship was rearmed and recommissioned on 7 December 1875; she was assigned to the First Division of the Squadron of Evolutions in 1876‚Äì1878. On 17 January 1879 Provence became the flagship of Rear Admiral Laurent Joseph Lejeune and was detached to the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship was became the flagship of Rear Admiral L√©opold de Pritzbuer, commander of the Levant Naval Division on 3 June. Rear Admiral Alfred Conrad relieved de Pritzbuer on 1 August 1881. Provence was condemned on 3 May 1886 and was hulked for use as a target. The ship was sold for scrap on 10 November 1893 and broken up in Toulon.

Born in Tallula, Mississippi, to John Diggs and Etta Jones, Diggs moved to Detroit in 1913, where he owned a successful funeral home on the lower east side. Political career A follower of Marcus Garvey during the 1920s, Diggs first became involved in politics as a Republican, and then changed affiliation to the Democrats in 1932. Diggs was an early organizer of the Black Democratic Clubs in Detroit. Diggs was a member of the Michigan State Senate from the 3rd District from 1937-1944, and was a delegate from Michigan to the Democratic National Convention in 1940. Diggs gained a reputation as a friend of organized labor and a civil rights champion. Diggs had a personal story of traveling to Lansing in 1938 for his first session in the Legislature, and then being denied a room because of his race at the Olds Hotel across the street from the State Capitol. Diggs was forced to live during the week in one of Lansing's segregated neighborhoods. Diggs responded with a series of bills aimed at strengthening Michigan's civil rights laws, and the Diggs Law (Equal Accommodations Act of 1938--Act 117, signed by Governor Frank Murphy) made discriminatory service based on color, race or creed a misdemeanor. In 1944, Diggs was defeated in the Democratic primary. Later, Diggs was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Representative from Michigan (1st District) as a Republican in the 1948 primary, and then as a Democrat in the 1952 primary. Criminal convictions On January 22, 1944, Diggs and 19 other current or former state legislators were charged with accepting bribes. Diggs was convicted and sentenced to three-to-five years in prison. In 1945, Diggs was convicted in a different bribery case. On July 20, 1946, Diggs and 18 other legislators were charged with accepting bribes to vote against a banking bill. The case was dropped when the witness for the prosecution, Charles F. Hemans, refused to testify. Personal life and death He was rooted in his family's business, the House of Diggs, which at one time was said to be Michigan's largest funeral home. Diggs was father to politician Charles C Diggs, Jr.. The elder Diggs was a member of the Elks. Diggs committed suicide at Detroit Memorial Hospital after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage and a stroke, jumping from his fourth-floor hospital room window to his death.http://nighttraintodetroit.com/2017/03/26/house-of-diggs/ He was interred at Detroit Memorial Park in Warren.

On each episode, two female contestants attempt to figure out what men believe about marriage, dating, work, and other subjects. Similar to Family Feud, the questions have previously been answered by a survey of one hundred men. Over the course of four rounds, a celebrity panel consisting of two men and a woman helps the contestants by offering their opinions about the correct answers to the surveys. The winner advances to the bonus round, which features a top prize of $10,000. The series, green-lit on August 16, 2013, began airing on January 8, 2014 and concluded on May 14, 2014. Critical reception for the series was mixed, with one writer calling it \\"a lot of fun\\" while another arguing the premise to be \\"low-minded.\\" Gameplay In the first round, the contestants are asked to predict the most popular answer to each of three questions. Each question has three multiple choice options, and was asked to a group of 100 men. The panel is allowed to offer their opinion on the correct answer while the contestants submit their answers on their tablet computers. Each correct prediction is worth $200. The second round plays almost exactly the same as the first round; however, the questions were asked to men who belong to a specific group (e.g., married men, African- American men, or men under the age of 25). Each correct prediction is worth $300. The last question of Round 2 is designated as the \\"VIP\\" question, which is focused on one specific group of men and asked to a special guest related to the question. When the VIP question is about a specific man, before the question is asked, the panel is allowed 30 seconds to \\"interrogate\\" the VIP about their background, personal preferences, etc., and then the question is played out as normal, with the VIP giving his answer verbally after the contestants give their prediction. Actor Ted Lange (most well known for his role on The Love Boat) appeared in some episodes as the show's bartender and was often the man who was previously asked the VIP question. In the third round (entitled \\"The Male Order\\"), each contestant, starting with the current leader (or the winner of a pre-show coin toss, in case of a tie), is given one question, and may choose any panelist to assist them on the question. For the Male Order question, the contestant is asked to rank the three answers from most popular to least popular. Although the panelist will give their opinion as to the correct ranking, the contestant has the final decision. The contestant picks up $100 for one answer correctly ranked, or $500 for all three. The fourth round is titled the \\"Men's High Five\\" and is an open-ended question asked to 200 men. The top five answers are placed on the board in a random order, and the panel again gives their opinion on what would be the most popular answer. If the score going into this question is tied, each contestant is allowed to select one answer, with the winner of the pre-show coin toss deciding who makes the first selection. If one contestant has the lead, that contestant goes first and is given a selection; her opponent is then allowed one provided the first contestant did not pick the most popular answer. If the most popular answer has not yet been revealed, the first contestant is given one more selection. The contestant who selects the highest-ranked answer wins the game, keeps her money, and plays the bonus round. Bonus Round Ted Lange appeared in several episodes of the series during the VIP question. For this round (entitled the \\"$10,000 Tag Team Round\\"), the contestant chooses one panelist to assist her. The host reads a series of pairs of related items, and each member of the team, in turn, tries to determine which answer was more popular. If, between the contestant and the panelist, a total of seven correct answers are given within 30 seconds, the contestant's winnings are increased to $10,000; if not, the contestant wins an additional $300 for every correct answer given. Production The series originally appeared during GSN's New York City upfront presentation on April 9, 2013. On August 16, 2013, GSN announced that the network had ordered forty episodes of Mind of a Man, and officially announced Davis as host on September 25, 2013. The series premiered January 8, 2014. The final episode aired on May 14, 2014, while GSN did not renew the show for a second season, the series was pitched for syndication in the 2015‚àí16 season. Reception Mind of a Man garnered mixed reception from critics. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times argued that the questions were \\"frivolous\\" and previewed the series as being \\"vacuous but often amusing.\\" The Washington Posts Marc Silver called the series \\"low-minded\\" and claimed that after watching an episode, his \\"mind need[ed] to go take a shower.\\" Acting rather neutral, Hank Stuever, also from The Washington Post, argued that the series' title \\"sound[s] like the premise for an SNL sketch.\\" Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment, however, was pleased with the series, calling it \\"a lot of fun\\" and deeming Davis a \\"great host.\\" Ratings The series premiere on January 8, 2014, garnered average ratings, with the premiere episode earning 497,000 total viewers and 112,000 viewers among adults 18‚àí49, GSN debuted the series that night with four consecutive episodes, which averaged around 407,000 viewers during the two- hour programming stack.

Britten wrote it in 1934 between 11 July and 17 September, scored for treble solo, four-part choir (SATB) and organ.  History and versions  Britten dedicated the work: \\"Written for Maurice Vinden and the Choir of St Mark's, N. Audley St, London\\". It was first performed in concert at the medieval Church of St Michael's, Cornhill, London, on 13 November 1935 by the St Michael's Singers and organist George Thalben-Ball, with soprano May Bartlett, conducted by Harold Darke. The work was among Britten's first compositions to be published, by Oxford University Press. Commissioned by the BBC, Britten orchestrated the work in 1936 between 14 and 20 January, for harp or piano and string orchestra. This version was first performed in concert at the Mercury Theatre, London, on 27 January 1936 in the Lemare concert series, by the Choir of St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, conducted by Reginald Goodall. Britten played the viola in the unnamed orchestra. Britten composed Jubilate Deo in C in 1961 as a companion piece.  Music  The music in one movement, which takes about 9 minutes to perform, is based on an ostinato of the organ in the beginning and in the reprise after a contrasting middle section. Beginning pianissimo, the voices build chords from bass to soprano. Barry Holden describes: \\"In the opening pages it adheres steadfastly to a chord of C major in the choral parts, and builds its musical interest without traditional use of harmonic progression, but by use of short motifs which are constantly reworked\\". Gradually more intense, the voices reach a climax on \\"Holy, Holy, Holy\\". After a general rest, they proclaim in unison with the organ: \\"Lord God of Sabaoth\\". In the middle section the soloist addresses God softly: \\"Thou art the King of Glory, O Christ\\". The choir joins, not only in this line, for \\"O Christ\\", repeating that pattern also for the following acclamations up to \\"Thou didst open the Kingdom of Heav'n to all believers\\", finally just inserting \\"Christ\\". Holden comments: \\"The haunting treble solo which sets the individual against the chorus is a typically ingenious idea.\\" A second climax is reached before a quiet ending. Paul Spicer summarizes in his commentary for the publisher Boosey & Hawkes: \\"It has drama, energy, variety, and clarity and integrity of structure\\".

The process is characterized by the elongation of the fluid mass forming thin, thread-like regions between larger nodules of fluid. The thread-like regions continue to thin until they break, forming individual droplets of fluid. Thread breakup occurs where two fluids or a fluid in a vacuum form a free surface with surface energy. If more surface area is present than the minimum required to contain the volume of fluid, the system has an excess of surface energy. A system not at the minimum energy state will attempt to rearrange so as to move toward the lower energy state, leading to the breakup of the fluid into smaller masses to minimize the system surface energy by reducing the surface area. The exact outcome of the thread breakup process is dependent on the surface tension, viscosity, density, and diameter of the thread undergoing breakup. History The examination of droplet formation has a long history, first traceable to the work of Leonardo da Vinci who wrote: He thus correctly attributed the fall of droplets to gravity and the mechanism which drives thread breakup to the cohesion of water molecules. The first correct analysis of fluid thread breakup was determined qualitatively by Thomas Young and mathematically by Pierre-Simon Laplace between 1804 and 1805. They correctly attributed the driver of thread breakup to surface tension properties. Moreover, they also deduced the importance of mean curvature in the creation of excess pressure in the fluid thread. Through their analysis, they showed that surface tension can behave in two ways: an elastic mechanism that can support a hanging droplet and a pressure mechanism due to capillary pressure that promotes thread breakup. In the 1820s, the Italian physicist and hydraulic engineer Giorgio Bidone studied the deformation of jets of water issuing from orifices of various shapes.See: * * F√©lix Savart followed in 1833 with experimental work, utilizing the stroboscopic technique to quantitatively measure thread breakup. He noted that breakup is a spontaneous process, occurring without an external stimuli. This work allowed him to determine that droplets are produced from a jet flowing from a tank at a distinct rate inversely proportional to the nozzle radius and proportional to pressure in the tank. These observations facilitated Joseph Plateau's work that established the relationship between jet breakup and surface energy. Plateau was able to determine the most unstable disturbance wavelength on the fluid thread, which was later revised by Lord Rayleigh to account for jet dynamics. As the surface disturbance becomes large, non-linear theory must be applied. The behavior of jets with large disturbances was examined experimentally by Magnus and Lenard. Their experiments helped to characterize satellite droplets, droplets that are produced in addition to the large main droplet, through the introduction of high speed photography. High speed photography is now the standard method for experimentally analyzing thread breakup. With the advent of greater computational power, numerical simulations have begun to replace experimental efforts as the chief means of understanding fluid breakup. However, difficulty remains in accurately tracking the free surface of many liquids due to its complex behavior. The most success has occurred with fluids of low and high viscosity where the boundary integral method can be employed as the Green's function for both cases is known. Dommermuth and Yue characterized irrotational, inviscid flow by this method as did Schulkes. Youngren and Acrivos considered the behavior of a bubble in a high viscosity liquid. Stone and Leal expanded this initial work to consider the dynamics of individual drops. For fluids of middling viscosity, full simulations using the Navier- Stokes equations are required with methods determining the free surface such as level-set and volume of fluid. The earliest work with full Navier-Stokes simulations was done by Fromm which focused on inkjet technology. Such simulations remain an active area of research. Physical mechanism of thread breakup The process undergone by a fluid thread or jet undergoing breakup from a larger mass to a smaller mass. The breakup process in a fluid thread or jet begins with the development of small perturbations on the free surface of the fluid. This is known as the linear theory of fluid thread breakup. These perturbations are always present and can be generated by numerous sources including vibrations of the fluid container or non-uniformity in the shear stress on the free surface. In general, these disturbances take an arbitrary form and are thus difficult to consider rigorously. It is therefore helpful to take a Fourier transform of the disturbances to decompose the arbitrary disturbances into perturbations of various single wavelengths on the surface of the thread. In doing so, this allows one to determine which wavelengths of the disturbance will grow and which will decay in time. The growth and decay of wavelengths can be determined by examining the change in pressure a perturbation wavelength imposes on the interior of the fluid thread. Changes to the internal pressure of the thread are induced by capillary pressure as the free surface of the thread deforms. Capillary pressure is a function of the mean curvature of the interface at a given location at the surface, meaning the pressure is dependent on the two radii of curvature that give the shape of the surface. Within the thinned area of a fluid thread undergoing breakup, the first radius of curvature is smaller than the radius of curvature in the thickened area, leading to a pressure gradient that would tend to force liquid from the thinned to thickened areas. However, the second radius of curvature remains important to the breakup process. For some perturbation wavelengths, the effect of the second radius of curvature can overcome the pressure effect of the first radius of curvature, inducing a larger pressure in the thickened regions than the thinned regions. This would push fluid back toward the thinned regions and tend to return the thread to its original, undisturbed shape. However, for other perturbation wavelengths, the capillary pressure induced by the second radius of curvature will reinforce that of the first radius of curvature. This will drive fluid from the thinned to the thickened regions and further promote thread breakup. Radii of curvature in a thread undergoing the breakup process. Blue represents the first radius of curvature and red the second radius of curvature at the thinned and thickened locations. The wavelength of the perturbation is therefore the critical parameter in determining whether a given fluid thread will breakup into smaller masses of fluid. Rigorous mathematical examination of the perturbation wavelengths can lead to a relation showing which wavelengths are stable for a given thread as well as which perturbation wavelengths will grow most rapidly. The size of the fluid masses resulting from the breakup of a fluid thread can be approximated by the wavelengths of the perturbation that grow most rapidly. Non-linear behavior While linear theory is useful in considering the growth of small disturbances on the free surface, when the disturbances grow to have a significant amplitude, non-linear effects begin to dominate breakup behavior. The non-linear behavior of the thread governs its final breakup and ultimately determines the final shape and number of the resulting fluid masses. Nonlinearity is captured through the use of self-similarity. Self- similarity assumes that the behavior of the fluid thread as the radius approaches zero is the same as the behavior of the fluid thread when it has some finite radius. Detailed understanding of non-linear thread behavior requires the use of asymptotic expansions to generate the appropriate scaling behavior. Numerous solutions have been found for the non-linear behavior of fluid threads based on the forces that are relevant in particular circumstances. Important parameters How a fluid thread or jet undergoes breakup is governed by several parameters among which are the Reynolds number, the Weber number, Ohnesorge number, and the disturbance wavelength. While these numbers are common in fluid mechanics, the parameters selected as scales must be appropriate to thread breakup. The length scale most often selected is the radius of the fluid thread, while the velocity is most often taken to be the velocity of the bulk fluid motion. However, these scales can change based on the characteristics of the considered problem. The Reynolds number is the ratio between inertia and viscous effects within the thread. For large Reynolds numbers, the effects of motion of the thread are much greater than viscous dissipation. Viscosity only has a minimal damping effect on the thread. For small Reynolds numbers, viscous dissipation is large and any disturbances are rapidly damped from the thread. The Weber number is the ratio between inertia and surface tension effects within the thread. When the Weber number is large, the inertia of the thread is large which resists the tendency of surface tension to flatten bent surfaces. For small Weber numbers, the changes in the capillary pressure due to the surface disturbances is large and surface tension dominates thread behavior. The Ohnesorge number is the ratio between viscous and surface tension effects within the thread. As it eliminates the effects of inertia and the need for a velocity scale, it is oftentimes more convenient to express scaling relationships in terms of the Ohnesorge number rather than the Reynolds and Weber number individually. The perturbation wavelength is the characteristic length of the disturbance on the surface of the jet, assuming that any arbitrary disturbance can be decomposed via a Fourier transform into its constitutive components. The wavelength of the perturbation is critical in determining if a particular disturbance will grow or decay in time. Special cases=Linear stability of inviscid liquids The linear stability of low viscosity liquids was first derived by Plateau in 1873. However, his solution has become known as the Rayleigh- Plateau instability due to the extension of the theory by Lord Rayleigh to include fluids with viscosity. Rayleigh-Plateau instability is often used as an introductory case to hydrodynamic stability as well as perturbation analysis. Plateau considered the stability of a thread of fluid when only inertial and surface tension effects were present. By decomposing an arbitrary disturbance on the free surface into its constitutive harmonics/wavelengths, he was able to derive the a condition for the stability of the jet in terms of the perturbation: :\\\\omega^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma k}{\\\\rho a^2} \\\\frac{I_1(ka)}{I_0(ka)} \\\\left ( 1 - k^2 a^2 \\\\right ), where œâ is the growth rate of the perturbation, œÉ is the surface tension of the fluids, k is the wavenumber of perturbation, œÅ is the fluid density, a is the initial radius of the unperturbed fluid, and I is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. By computing the growth rate as a function of wavenumber, one can determine that the fastest growing disturbance wavelength occurs at: : \\\\lambda_\\\\text{max} \\\\approx 9.02a. The wavelength of maximum instability increases as the radius of the fluid thread increases. As importantly, unstable modes are only possible when: : ka < 1. Linear stability of viscous liquids Reynolds and later Tomotika extended Plateau's work to consider the linear stability of viscous threads. Rayleigh solved for the stability of a viscous thread of viscosity \\\\mu_A without the presence of an external fluid. Tomokita solved for the stability of a fluid thread in the presence of an external fluid with its own viscosity \\\\mu_B . He considered three cases where the viscosity of the fluid thread was much greater than the external environment, the viscosity of the external environment was much greater than the fluid thread, and the general case where the liquids are of arbitrary viscosity. =Fluid thread highly viscous= For the limiting case where the fluid thread is much more viscous than the external environment, the viscosity of the external environment falls from the growth rate completely. The growth rate thus becomes only a function of the initial radius of thread, the perturbation wavelength, the surface tension of the thread, and the thread viscosity. :\\\\omega = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma \\\\left ( k^2 a^2-1 \\\\right )}{2a \\\\mu_A} \\\\frac{1}{k^2 a^2 + 1 - k^2 a^2 I_0^2(ka) / I_1^2(ka)} Plotting this, one finds that the longest wavelengths are the most unstable. As importantly, one can note that the viscosity of the fluid thread does not influence which wavelengths will be stable. Viscosity only acts to decrease how rapidly a given perturbation will grow or decay with time. Examples of when this case would apply are when almost any liquid undergoes thread/jet breakup in an air environment. =External fluid highly viscous= For the limiting case where the external environment of the fluid thread is much more viscous than the thread itself, the viscosity of the fluid thread falls from the perturbation growth rate completely. The growth rate thus becomes only a function of the initial radius of the thread, the perturbation wavelength, the surface tension of the thread, the viscosity of the external environment, and the second order Bessel functions of the second kind. : \\\\omega = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma \\\\left (1 - k^2 a^2 \\\\right )}{2a \\\\mu_B} \\\\frac{1}{k^2 a^2 + 1 - k^2 a^2 K_0^2(ka) / K_1^2(ka)} If one were to plot the growth rate as a function of the perturbation wavelength, one would find that the most unstable wavelengths again occur at the longest wavelengths and that the viscosity of the external environment would only act to decrease how rapidly a perturbation would grow or decay in time. Examples of when this case would apply are when gas bubbles enter a liquid or when water falls into honey. =General case - arbitrary viscosity ratio= The general case for two viscous fluids is much more difficult to solve directly. Tomotika expressed his solution as: :\\\\omega = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma \\\\left ( 1 - k^2 a^2 \\\\right ) }{2a \\\\mu_B} \\\\Phi(ka) where \\\\Phi was defined as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi(ka) ={} &\\\\frac{N(ka)}{D(ka)} \\\\ N(ka) ={} &I;_1 (ka) \\\\Delta_1 - {ka I_0 (ka) - I_1 (ka)} \\\\Delta_2 \\\\ D (ka) ={} &\\\\frac{\\\\mu_A}{\\\\mu_B} {ka I_0 (ka) - I_1 (ka)} \\\\Delta_1 - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_A}{\\\\mu_B} \\\\left {\\\\left (k^2a^2 +1 \\\\right ) I_1(ka) - ka I_0(ka) \\\\right } \\\\Delta_2 \\\\ &\\\\- {kaK_0 (ka) + K_1(ka)} \\\\Delta_3 - \\\\left { \\\\left ( k^2 a^2 +1 \\\\right ) K_1 (ka) + ka K_0 (ka) \\\\right } \\\\Delta_4 \\\\end{align} The \\\\Delta coefficients are most easily expressed as the determinants of the following matrices: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta_1 &= \\\\begin{vmatrix} kaI_0 (ka) - I_1(ka) & K_1(ka) & -kaK_0(ka) - K_1(ka) \\\\ I_0(ka) + kaI_1(ka) & -K_0(ka) & -K_0(ka) + kaK_1(ka) \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\mu_A}{\\\\mu_B}kaI_0 (ka) & K_1(ka) & -kaK_0(ka) \\\\end{vmatrix} [3pt] \\\\Delta_2 &= \\\\begin{vmatrix} I_1(ka) & K_1(ka) & -kaK_0 (ka) - K_1(ka) \\\\ I_0(ka) & \\\\- K_0(ka) & -K_0(ka) + ka K_1(ka) \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\mu_A}{\\\\mu_B}I_1(ka) & K_1(ka) & -kaK_0(ka) \\\\end{vmatrix} [3pt] \\\\Delta_3 &= \\\\begin{vmatrix} I_1(ka) & ka I_0(ka) - I_1(ka) & -ka K_0(ka) - K_1(ka) \\\\ I_0(ka) & I_0(ka) + kaI_1(ka) & -K_0(ka) + ka K_1(ka) \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\mu_A}{\\\\mu_B} I_1(ka) & \\\\frac{\\\\mu_A}{\\\\mu_B}kaI_0(ka) & -ka K_0(ka) \\\\end{vmatrix} [3pt] \\\\Delta_4 &= \\\\begin{vmatrix} I_1(ka) & ka I_0(ka) - I_1(ka) & K_1(ka) \\\\ I_0(ka) & I_0(ka) + kaI_1(ka) & -K_0(ka) \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\mu_A}{\\\\mu_B}I_1 (ka) & \\\\frac{\\\\mu_a}{\\\\mu_B} ka I_0(ka) & K_1(ka) \\\\end{vmatrix} \\\\end{align} The resulting solution remains a function of both the thread and external environment viscosities as well as the perturbation wavelength. The most unstable combination of viscosities and perturbation occurs when \\\\mu_A/\\\\mu_B \\\\approx 0.28 with \\\\lambda \\\\approx 10.66a . For most applications, use of the general case is unnecessary as the two fluids in question have significantly different viscosities which permits the use of one of the limiting cases. However, some instances such as the mixing of oils or oils and water may require the use of the general case. Satellite drop formation Water flows from a faucet, producing both a single large droplet and several satellite droplets. Satellite drops, also known as secondary droplets, are the drops produced during the thread breakup process in addition to the large main droplet. The drops result when the filament by which the main droplet in hanging from the larger fluid mass itself breaks off from the fluid mass. The fluid contained in the filament can stay as a single mass or breakup due to the recoil disturbances imposed on it by the separation of the main droplet. While the production of satellite droplets can be predicted based on fluid properties, their precise location and volume cannot be predicted. In general, secondary droplets are an unwanted phenomenon, especially in applications where precise deposition of droplets is important. The production of satellite droplets is governed by the non-linear dynamics of the problem near the final stages of thread breakup. Examples The viscosity of honey is large enough to damp all surface perturbations that would lead to the breakup of the thread into droplets. Numerous examples of the breakup of fluid threads exist in daily life. It is one of the most common fluid mechanics phenomena one experiences and as such most give the process little thought. Flow from a faucet Dripping water is an everyday occurrence. As water leaves the faucet, the filament attached to the faucet begins to neck down, eventually to the point that the main droplet detaches from the surface. The filament cannot retract sufficiently rapidly to the faucet to prevent breakup and thus disintegrates into several small satellite drops. Air bubbles Air bubbles are another common breakup phenomenon. As air enters a tank of liquid, like a fish tank, the thread again necks at the base to produce a bubble. Blowing bubbles from a straw into a glass behaves in much the same manner. Pitch drop experiment The pitch drop experiment is a famous fluid breakup experiment using high viscous tar pitch. The rate of breakup is slowed to such a degree that only 11 drops have fallen since 1927. Drops of honey Honey is sufficiently viscous that the surface perturbations that lead to breakup are almost fully damped from honey threads. This results in the production of long filaments of honey rather than individual droplets.

They are endemic to the Western Ghats of southern India. They are the sister taxon to a larger clade consisting of Chiromantis, Feihyla, Taruga, Polypedates, and Rhacophorus. The name of the genus combines words \\"Ghats\\" and \\"Ixalus\\". The former refers to the Western Ghats, and the latter to now-abandoned genus name that lives as the suffix in many generic names for rhacophorid frogs. Description Ghatixalus are medium-to giant-sized frogs with adult males measuring and females adults (male SVL 38.8‚Äì82 mm, female 58.1‚Äì66.7 mm) in snout-vent length. They have a dorsal color pattern with dark brown prominent blotches. Eggs develop in foam nests followed by a free- swimming tadpole stage. Their habitat is associated with mountain streams throughout their life cycle. Distribution and natural history This exclusively Shola forest specialist genus is distributed only in the high elevations of Nilgiris and Anaimalai-Palnis, only above 1600 m asl. Most of the sightings were near streams and streamside often on bare ground, grass clumps on ground or rocks nearby. Although belonging to rather arboreal frog family, these frogs are terrestrial animals. Species There are only 3 recognized species in the genus Ghatixalus: * Ghatixalus asterops Biju, Roelants, and Bossuyt, 2008 endemic to Upper Palni Hills, Anaimalai and High Ranges. * Ghatixalus magnus Abraham, Mathew, Cyriac, Zachariah, Raju and Zachariah, 2015 endemic to the Anaimalai Hills, High Ranges, Cardamom Hills, Meghamalai and Pandalam Hills * Ghatixalus variabilis (Jerdon, 1854) endemic to Upper Nilgiri Hills The Palakkad Gap is believed to be a prominent biogeographic barrier that has caused speciation between the sister species G. asterops and G. variabilis.

Naturalization as a Georgian Anyone who has stayed in Georgia for a total period of ten years may apply for Georgian nationality. The applicant will be asked to undergo a language proficiency test which will also test the applicant's general knowledge of the history and the heritage of Georgia. Foreign citizens may obtain Georgian citizenship after marrying a Georgian citizen for five years. While applying for citizenship, the non-Georgian spouse should have a marriage anniversary certificate. Having a child with the Georgian spouse would strengthen their case for naturalization. Temporary Residence permit Anyone who enters the Georgian state with a valid passport (or ID card for EU/Swiss/Turkish or Ukrainian citizens) and visa (where required) may ask for a temporary residence permit which may be extended up to a period of 6 years. The decision of giving the residence permit is totally up to the municipal government of the area in which the applicant resides. Generally people who come for medical treatment or business are warmly welcomed. Permanent residence permit Anyone who has stayed a period of 6 years in Georgia with a temporary residence permit may apply for a permanent residence permit. Visas and Residence permit Foreign staff of diplomatic missions and consular posts, as well as similar representations accredited to Georgia need visas for their first entry to the territory of Georgia. During their accreditation period they stay in the country and cross the border on the basis of an accreditation card issued according to the determined rule of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia, if other is not provided by international obligation. In cases determined by the Georgian legislation a visa/entry permit for up 90 days (visa fee 50 GEL) or for 360 days (visa fee 100 GEL) can be issued by the Patrol Police of Georgia (sub-divisional institution of the Ministry of Internal Affairs) at border crossing points situated at the Georgian State Border. The basis for the stay of an alien in Georgia is a visa or residence permit (permanent or temporary) if other is not provided by this law and international treaties of Georgia. Visa requirements for entering the Georgian territory The citizens of, and foreign nationals who permanently reside in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United States, the Republic of Lithuania, Swiss Confederation, Germany, Republic of Korea, Czech Republic, Republic of Hungary, Republic of Poland, Republic of Slovenia, Kingdom of Denmark, Republic of Ireland, Kingdom of Norway, Kingdom of Sweden, Kingdom of Spain, Republic of Bulgaria, Slovak Republic, Republic of Romania, United Mexican States, Republic of Estonia or the Republic of Latvia and who possess a document certifying permanent residence in one of these countries, do not need a visa to enter and stay in the territory of Georgia up to 360 days. Foreign nationals, who have temporary residence document and reside in the territory of Qatar, Sultanate of Oman, Kingdom of Bahrain or State of Kuwait do not need a visa to enter and stay in the territory of Georgia up to 360 days. The citizens of Russian Federation and foreign nationals residing in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia having valid resident permit do not need a visa to enter and stay in the territory of Georgia up to 90 days. Georgian, Turkish, Ukrainian, EU and Swiss citizens can enter Georgia on a national ID card. Foreign nationals who are holders of the United Nations', or its specialized agencies', travel documents (Laissez-Passer), can enter or stay in the territory of Georgia without a visa up to 90 days. Taiwanese passport holders are completely banned from entering Georgia.  Special Nationality  An application for naturalization may be presented to the president of Georgia. The President has the right to grant Georgian nationality to anyone, including making a person a dual national, if they find that person important to the national interest of the state of Georgia. Those who receive Georgian citizenship in this manner, by decree of the president of Georgia, may keep their foreign nationality and become dual nationals of their other country and of Georgia. This way of granting Georgian nationality also became a way for the President to enable ethnic Georgians who left Georgia during the Soviet era, and their descendants who had been born out of Georgia, to reunite with their ancestral homeland. This is considered a national goal and in the state interest. Keeping in consideration that granting the nationality to a particular person is beneficial for Georgia, such special nationality is granted without the need of fulfilling the 'residence and language' requirements.

The eldest younger brother of Bayinnaung was appointed governor of Zayweon by King Tabinshwehti in 1541, and viceroy of Martaban in 1552 by Bayinnaung. He participated in the military campaigns of the Toungoo Empire from 1534, and as a commander from 1540 to 1555. Early life He was born c. 1520 at the Toungoo Palace to Mingyi Swe and Shin Myo Myat, royal household servants of Crown Prince Tabinshwehti.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 247‚Äì248He was probably born three or four years after the birth of Tabinshwehti since his mother was hired to be the prince's wet nurse. He had one elder sister, Dhamma Dewi, an elder brother, Bayinnaung, and a younger brother, Thado Dhamma Yaza II. He also had two younger half-brothers, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw who were born to his aunt (his mother's younger sister) and his father. Military career He participated in Toungoo's campaigns against Hanthawaddy (1534‚Äì41), and by 1540 had achieved the rank of regimental commander with the style of Thiri Zeya Kyawhtin ().Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 149 He was appointed governor of Zayweon (modern Labutta) in 1541 by Tabinshwehti.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 155 He served as a regimental commander in Toungoo's campaigns against Prome (1541‚Äì42) and Ava Kingdom (1543‚Äì44).Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 167 He led a naval squadron in the Arakan campaign (1546‚Äì47).Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 174 He led an elephant battalion in the Siam campaign of (1548‚Äì49).Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 183 In 1550, he joined his brothers Bayinnaung and Thado Dhamma Yaza II on the campaign to suppress the rebellion of Smim Htaw.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 194 He was a key member of Bayinnaung's drive to restore the Toungoo Empire which fell apart after Tabinshwehti was assassinated on 30 April 1550.

Anatomical terminology uses many unique terms, suffixes, and prefixes deriving from Ancient Greek and Latin. These terms can be confusing to those unfamiliar with them, but can be more precise, reducing ambiguity and errors. Also, since these anatomical terms are not used in everyday conversation, their meanings are less likely to change, and less likely to be misinterpreted. To illustrate how inexact day- to-day language can be: a scar \\"above the wrist\\" could be located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand or at the base of the hand; and could be on the palm-side or back-side of the arm. By using precise anatomical terminology such ambiguity is eliminated. An international standard for anatomical terminology, Terminologia Anatomica has been created. Word formation Anatomical terminology has quite regular morphology, the same prefixes and suffixes are used to add meanings to different roots. The root of a term often refers to an organ or tissue. For example, the Latin names of structures such as musculus biceps brachii can be split up and refer to, musculus for muscle, biceps for \\"two-headed\\", brachii as in the brachial region of the arm. The first word describes what is being spoken about, the second describes it, and the third points to location. When describing the position of anatomical structures, structures may be described according to the anatomical landmark they are near. These landmarks may include structures, such as the umbilicus or sternum, or anatomical lines, such as the midclavicular line from the centre of the clavicle. The cephalon or cephalic region refers to the head. This area is further differentiated into the cranium (skull), facies (face), frons (forehead), oculus (eye area), auris (ear), bucca (cheek), nasus (nose), oris (mouth), and mentum (chin). The neck area is called the cervix or cervical region. Examples of structures named according to this include the frontalis muscle, submental lymph nodes, buccal membrane and orbicularis oculi muscle. Sometimes, unique terminology is used to reduce confusion in different parts of the body. For example, different terms are used when it comes to the skull in compliance with its embryonic origin and its tilted position compared to in other animals. Here, Rostral refers to proximity to the front of the nose, and is particularly used when describing the skull. Similarly, different terminology is often used in the arms, in part to reduce ambiguity as to what the \\"front\\", \\"back\\", \\"inner\\" and \\"outer\\" surfaces are. For this reason, the terms below are used: *Radial referring to the radius bone, seen laterally in the standard anatomical position. *Ulnar referring to the ulna bone, medially positioned when in the standard anatomical position. Other terms are also used to describe the movement and actions of the hands and feet, and other structures such as the eye. History International morphological terminology is used by the colleges of medicine and dentistry and other areas of the health sciences. It facilitates communication and exchanges between scientists from different countries of the world and it is used daily in the fields of research, teaching and medical care. The international morphological terminology refers to morphological sciences as a biological sciences' branch. In this field, the form and structure are examined as well as the changes or developments in the organism. It is descriptive and functional. Basically, it covers the gross anatomy and the microscopic (histology and cytology) of living beings. It involves both development anatomy (embryology) and the anatomy of the adult. It also includes comparative anatomy between different species. The vocabulary is extensive, varied and complex, and requires a systematic presentation. Within the international field, a group of experts reviews, analyzes and discusses the morphological terms of the structures of the human body, forming today's Terminology Committee (FICAT) from the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA). It deals with the anatomical, histological and embryologic terminology. In the Latin American field, there are meetings called Iberian Latin American Symposium Terminology (SILAT), where a group of experts of the Pan American Association of Anatomy (PAA) that speak Spanish and Portuguese, disseminates and studies the international morphological terminology. The current international standard for human anatomical terminology is based on the Terminologia Anatomica (TA). It was developed by the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT) and the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA) and was released in 1998. It supersedes the previous standard, Nomina Anatomica. Terminologia Anatomica contains terminology for about 7500 human gross (macroscopic) anatomical structures. For microanatomy, known as histology, a similar standard exists in Terminologia Histologica, and for embryology, the study of development, a standard exists in Terminologia Embryologica. These standards specify generally accepted names that can be used to refer to histological and embryological structures in journal articles, textbooks, and other areas. As of September 2016, two sections of the Terminologia Anatomica, including central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, were merged to form the Terminologia Neuroanatomica. Recently, the Terminologia Anatomica has been perceived with a considerable criticism regarding its content including coverage, grammar and spelling mistakes, inconsistencies, and errors. Location Anatomical terminology is often chosen to highlight the relative location of body structures. For instance, an anatomist might describe one band of tissue as \\"inferior to\\" another or a physician might describe a tumor as \\"superficial to\\" a deeper body structure. Anatomical position The anatomical position, with terms of relative location noted. Anatomical terms used to describe location are based on a body positioned in what is called the standard anatomical position. This position is one in which a person is standing, feet apace, with palms forward and thumbs facing outwards. Just as maps are normally oriented with north at the top, the standard body \\"map,\\" or anatomical position, is that of the body standing upright, with the feet at shoulder width and parallel, toes forward. The upper limbs are held out to each side, and the palms of the hands face forward. Using the standard anatomical position reduces confusion. It means that regardless of the position of a body, the position of structures within it can be described without ambiguity. Regions The human body is shown in anatomical position in an anterior view and a posterior view. The regions of the body are labeled in boldface. In terms of anatomy, the body is divided into regions. In the front, the trunk is referred to as the \\"thorax\\" and \\"abdomen\\". The back as a general area is the dorsum or dorsal area, and the lower back is the lumbus or lumbar region. The shoulder blades are the scapular area and the breastbone is the sternal region. The abdominal area is the region between the chest and the pelvis. The breast is also called the mammary region, the armpit as the axilla and axillary, and the navel as the umbilicus and umbilical. The pelvis is the lower torso, between the abdomen and the thighs. The groin, where the thigh joins the trunk, are the inguen and inguinal area. The entire arm is referred to as the brachium and brachial, the front of the elbow as the antecubitis and antecubital, the back of the elbow as the olecranon or olecranal, the forearm as the antebrachium and antebrachial, the wrist as the carpus and carpal area, the hand as the manus and manual, the palm as the palma and palmar, the thumb as the pollex, and the fingers as the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal. The buttocks are the gluteus or gluteal region and the pubic area is the pubis. Anatomists divide the lower limb into the thigh (the part of the limb between the hip and the knee) and the leg (which refers only to the area of the limb between the knee and the ankle). The thigh is the femur and the femoral region. The kneecap is the patella and patellar while the back of the knee is the popliteus and popliteal area. The leg (between the knee and the ankle) is the crus and crural area, the lateral aspect of the leg is the peroneal area, and the calf is the sura and sural region. The ankle is the tarsus and tarsal, and the heel is the calcaneus or calcaneal. The foot is the pes and pedal region, and the sole of the foot is the planta and plantar. As with the fingers, the toes are also called the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal area. The big toe is referred to as the hallux. =Abdomen= Abdominal regions are used for example to localize pain. To promote clear communication, for instance about the location of a patient‚Äôs abdominal pain or a suspicious mass, the abdominal cavity can be divided into either nine regions or four quadrants. ;Quadrants The abdomen may be divided into four quadrants, more commonly used in medicine, subdivides the cavity with one horizontal and one vertical line that intersect at the patient‚Äôs umbilicus (navel). The right upper quadrant (RUQ) includes the lower right ribs, right side of the liver, and right side of the transverse colon. The left upper quadrant (LUQ) includes the lower left ribs, stomach, spleen, and upper left area of the transverse colon. The right lower quadrant (RLQ) includes the right half of the small intestines, ascending colon, right pelvic bone and upper right area of the bladder. The left lower quadrant (LLQ) contains the left half of the small intestine and left pelvic bone. ;Regions The more detailed regional approach subdivides the cavity into nine regions, with two vertical and two horizontal lines drawn according to landmark structures. The vertical; or midclavicular lines, are drawn as if dropped from the midpoint of each clavicle. The superior horizontal line is the subcostal line, drawn immediately inferior to the ribs. The inferior horizontal line is called the intertubercular line, and is to cross the iliac tubercles, found at the superior aspect of the pelvis. The upper right square is the right hypochondriac region and contains the base of the right ribs. The upper left square is the left hypochondriac region and contains the base of the left ribs. The epigastric region is the upper central square and contains the bottom edge of the liver as well as the upper areas of the stomach. The diaphragm curves like an upside down U over these three regions. The central right region is called the right lumbar region and contains the ascending colon and the right edge of the small intestines. The central square contains the transverse colon and the upper regions of the small intestines. The left lumbar region contains the left edge of the transverse colon and the left edge of the small intestine. The lower right square is the right iliac region and contains the right pelvic bones and the ascending colon. The lower left square is the left iliac region and contains the left pelvic bone and the lower left regions of the small intestine. The lower central square contains the bottom of the pubic bones, upper regions of the bladder and the lower region of the small intestine. Standard terms When anatomists refer to the right and left of the body, it is in reference to the right and left of the subject, not the right and left of the observer. When observing a body in the anatomical position, the left of the body is on the observer‚Äôs right, and vice versa. These standardized terms avoid confusion. Examples of terms include: * Anterior and posterior, which describe structures at the front (anterior) and back (posterior) of the body. For example, the toes are anterior to the heel, and the popliteus is posterior to the patella. * Superior and inferior, which describe a position above (superior) or below (inferior) another part of the body. For example, the orbits are superior to the oris, and the pelvis is inferior to the abdomen. * Proximal and distal, which describe a position that is closer to (proximal) or farther from (distal) the trunk of the body. For example, the shoulder is proximal to the arm, and the foot is distal to the knee. * Superficial and deep, which describe structures that are closer to (superficial) or farther from (deep) the surface of the body. For example, the skin is superficial to the bones, and the brain is deep to the skull. Sometimes profound is used synonymously with deep. * Medial and lateral, which describe a position that is closer to (medial) or farther from (lateral) the midline of the body. For example, the nose is medial to the eyes, and the thumb is lateral to the other fingers. * Ventral and dorsal, which describe structures derived from the front (ventral) and back (dorsal) of the embryo, before limb rotation. * Rostral and caudal, which describe structures close to (rostral) or farther from (caudal) the nose. For example, the eyes are rostral to the back of the skull, and the tailbone is caudal to the chest. * Cranial and caudal, which describe structures close to the top of the skull (cranial), and towards the bottom of the body (caudal). * Occasionally, sinister for left, and dexter for right are used. * Paired, referring to a structure that is present on both sides of the body. For example, the hands are paired structures. Axes Each locational term above can define the direction of a vector, and pairs of them can define axes, that is, lines of orientation. For example, blood can be said to flow in a proximal or distal direction, and anteroposterior, mediolateral, and inferosuperior axes are lines along which the body extends, like the X, Y, and Z axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. An axis can be projected to a corresponding plane. Planes The three anatomical planes of the body: the sagittal, transverse (or horizontal), frontal planes Anatomy is often described in planes, referring to two- dimensional sections of the body. A section is a two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional structure that has been cut. A plane is an imaginary two- dimensional surface that passes through the body. Three planes are commonly referred to in anatomy and medicine: * The sagittal plane is the plane that divides the body or an organ vertically into right and left sides. If this vertical plane runs directly down the middle of the body, it is called the midsagittal or median plane. If it divides the body into unequal right and left sides, it is called a parasagittal plane, or less commonly a longitudinal section. * The frontal plane is the plane that divides the body or an organ into an anterior (front) portion and a posterior (rear) portion. The frontal plane is often referred to as a coronal plane, following Latin , which means \\"crown\\". * The transverse plane is the plane that divides the body or organ horizontally into upper and lower portions. Transverse planes produce images referred to as cross sections. Functional state Anatomical terms may be used to describe the functional state of an organ: * Anastomoses refers to the connection between two structures previously branched out, such as blood vessels or leaf veins. * Patent, meaning a structure such as an artery or vein that abnormally remains open, such as a patent ductus arteriosus, referring to the ductus arteriosus which normally becomes ligamentum arteriosum within three weeks of birth. Something that is patent may also refer to a channel such as a blood vessel, section of bowel, collecting system or duct that is not occluded and remains open to free flow. Such obstructions may include a calculus (i.e. a kidney stone or gallstone), plaque (like that encountered in vital arteries such as coronary arteries and cerebral arteries), or another unspecified obstruction, such as a mass or bowel obstruction. * A plexus refers to a net-like arrangement of a nerve. Anatomical variation The term anatomical variation is used to refer to a difference in anatomical structures that is not regarded as a disease. Many structures vary slightly between people, for example muscles that attach in slightly different places. For example, the presence or absence of the palmaris longus tendon. Anatomical variation is unlike congenital anomalies, which are considered a disorder. Movement 400px 400px Joints, especially synovial joints allow the body a tremendous range of movements. Each movement at a synovial joint results from the contraction or relaxation of the muscles that are attached to the bones on either side of the articulation. The type of movement that can be produced at a synovial joint is determined by its structural type. Movement types are generally paired, with one being the opposite of the other. Body movements are always described in relation to the anatomical position of the body: upright stance, with upper limbs to the side of body and palms facing forward. General motion Terms describing motion in general include: * Flexion and extension, which refer to a movement that decreases (flexion) or increases (extension) the angle between body parts. For example, when standing up, the knees are extended. *Abduction and adduction refers to a motion that pulls a structure away from (abduction) or towards (adduction) the midline of the body or limb. For example, a star jump requires the legs to be abducted. * Internal rotation (or medial rotation) and external rotation (or lateral rotation) refers to rotation towards (internal) or away from (external) the center of the body. For example, the Lotus position posture in yoga requires the legs to be externally rotated. * Elevation and depression refer to movement in a superior (elevation) or inferior (depression) direction. Primarily refers to movements involving the scapula and mandible. Special motions of the hands and feet These terms refer to movements that are regarded as unique to the hands and feet: * Dorsiflexion and plantarflexion refers to flexion (dorsiflexion) or extension of the foot at the ankle. For example, plantarflexion occurs when pressing the brake pedal of a car. * Palmarflexion and dorsiflexion refer to movement of the flexion (palmarflexion) or extension (dorsiflexion) of the hand at the wrist. For example, prayer is often conducted with the hands dorsiflexed. * Pronation and supination refer to rotation of the forearm or foot so that in the anatomical position the palm or sole is facing anteriorly (supination) or posteriorly (pronation) . For example, if a person makes a \\"thumbs up\\" gesture, supination will cause the thumb to point away from the body midline and the fingers and plam to be upwards, while pronation will cause the thumb to point towards the body midline with the back of the hand upwards. * Eversion and inversion refer to movements that tilt the sole of the foot away from (eversion) or towards (inversion) the midline of the body. Muscles The biceps brachii flex the lower arm. The brachioradialis, in the forearm, and brachialis, located deep to the biceps in the upper arm, are both synergists that aid in this motion. Muscle action that moves the axial skeleton work over a joint with an origin and insertion of the muscle on respective side. The insertion is on the bone deemed to move towards the origin during muscle contraction. Muscles are often present that engage in several actions of the joint; able to perform for example both flexion and extension of the forearm as in the biceps and triceps respectively. This is not only to be able to revert actions of muscles, but also brings on stability of the actions though muscle coactivation. Agonist and antagonist muscles The muscle performing an action is the agonist, while the muscle which contraction brings about an opposite action is the antagonist. For example, an extension of the lower arm is performed by the triceps as the agonist and the biceps as the antagonist (which contraction will perform flexion over the same joint). Muscles that work together to perform the same action are called synergists. In the above example synergists to the biceps can be the brachioradialis and the brachialis muscle. Skeletal and smooth muscle The skeletal muscles of the body typically come in seven different general shapes. This figure shows the human body with the major muscle groups labeled. The gross anatomy of a muscle is the most important indicator of its role in the body. One particularly important aspect of gross anatomy of muscles is pennation or lack thereof. In most muscles, all the fibers are oriented in the same direction, running in a line from the origin to the insertion. In pennate muscles, the individual fibers are oriented at an angle relative to the line of action, attaching to the origin and insertion tendons at each end. Because the contracting fibers are pulling at an angle to the overall action of the muscle, the change in length is smaller, but this same orientation allows for more fibers (thus more force) in a muscle of a given size. Pennate muscles are usually found where their length change is less important than maximum force, such as the rectus femoris. Skeletal muscle is arranged in discrete muscles, an example of which is the biceps brachii. The tough, fibrous epimysium of skeletal muscle is both connected to and continuous with the tendons. In turn, the tendons connect to the periosteum layer surrounding the bones, permitting the transfer of force from the muscles to the skeleton. Together, these fibrous layers, along with tendons and ligaments, constitute the deep fascia of the body. Joints Movement is not limited to only synovial joints, although they allow for most freedom. Muscles also run over symphysis, which allow for movement in for example the vertebral column by compression of the intervertebral discs. Additionally, synovial joints can be divided into different types, depending on their axis of movement. Membranes Serous membrane A serous membrane (also referred to as a serosa) is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The serous membranes have two layers; parietal and visceral, surrounding a fluid filled space. The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organ (the viscera), and the parietal layer lines the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a cavity wall). Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity. For example, the pericardium is the serous cavity which surrounds the heart. * Visceral and parietal describe structures that relate to an organ (visceral), or the wall of the cavity that the organ is in (parietal). For example, the parietal peritoneum surrounds the abdominal cavity.

The Old Gym was originally a gymnasium, later served as the Fine Arts Building, and currently houses the university's admissions office. History The gymnasium was completed in 1880 and featured an indoor running track and considerable gymnastic equipment. At the time, it was one of the best equipped gymnasiums in the southern United States. The exterior of the building remains fairly untouched while the interior space has been modified through the years and uses of the building. The Old Gym is on the National Register of Historic Places. The building consisted of a foundation of Tennessee limestone with a structure of wooden trusses and walls of natural finished red brick. The Mansard roof was covered with slate shingles. Some of the original gymnastic equipment included a leaping rig, a vaulting board, rowing machine, parallel bars, trapeze ropes, Indian clubs, dumb bells and a walnut chest expander. Remodeling In 1962 the Old Gym was renovated and made into the Fine Arts Building by Warfield and Associates. The remodeling project included the removal of the second-floor running track and the addition of heating and cooling throughout the building.

This impulsivity is in contrast with dysfunctional impulsivity, which is a tendency to make quick decisions when it is not optimal. Although both types can be associated with inaccurate results, functional impulsivity is often considered a point of pride because it can help individuals take full advantage of opportunities.  Dickman Impulsivity Inventory  Functional impulsivity was first distinguished from dysfunctional impulsivity in a study performed by Scott J. Dickman in 1990. Although impulsivity has always been understood to have many different facets, Dickman showed two varieties that were significantly unrelated to one another. Before this research, impulsivity had commonly been considered a negative trait that could lead to problems in life. This research demonstrated that a specific type of impulsivity could be optimal and considered a positive trait. The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory was developed to distinguish between trait functional and dysfunctional impulsivity. This inventory contains 63 items, 17 of which pertain specifically to functional impulsivity. This includes answer seeking propositions such as \\"I like to take part in really fast paced conversations, where you don't have much time to think before you speak\\" and \\"I am good at taking advantage of unexpected opportunities, where you have to do something immediately or lose your chance\\". Before the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory, many of the measures of impulsivity related specifically to dysfunctional impulsivity. For instance, the only measure on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire that was directly related to functional impulsivity measured venturesomeness. The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory has been translated into many languages and a children's version has been developed. Each scale has found a significant difference between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity.  Related constructs  Functional impulsivity is related to enthusiasm, adventurousness, activity, extraversion, and narcissism. This is likely because individuals with high functional impulsivity are shown to have enhanced executive functioning overall. Also, high levels of this trait have been associated with higher professional success in NFL players, who also exhibit a smaller probability of experiencing negative consequences. Retrieved from PsychINFO. (298201). Although high trait impulsivity has long been associated with substance abuse, several studies have found that relates only to dysfunctional impulsivity and not to functional impulsivity. Functional impulsivity has been shown to have no effect on binge drinking. In fact, it has actually been shown that individuals who are low in functional impulsivity will have more intense cravings for cigarettes as well as for heroin and opiates.

Initially referred to as the Household Arts Building, it was built by the New York firm the Hedden Construction Company and designed by Ludlow and Peabody Architects. It opened for classes in the summer of 1914. Although not as elaborate as the Industrial Arts Building the Home Economics Building does sport marble floors and exterior elements of design that reflect the domestic work for which the building was to be used. The red brick structure, the columns of the building as well as the decorative swag elements over the front windows perpetuate the style desired by President Bruce R. Payne and the Executive Committee of the Board of Trust, one that is reflective of the University of Virginia campus where President Payne had attended college Subsequent buildings were styled in the same manner though not as elaborately. A small greenhouse (512 sq. ft.) built at the same time as the structure is attached to the building and still is in use. In 1993 the building was renovated eliminating the laboratories, expanding the classrooms and creating more faculty offices. Use Originally conceived of as a home for the study of Domestic Arts and housing two laboratories the Home Economics Building has seen what is taught within its walls change dramatically through the years. Rooms that taught the science of nutrition and elements of home canning have made way for classes on human development and psychology. In 1916, due to a lack of a proper library, the Home Economics Building housed 20,000 books in its Assembly Room with the overflow of books being stored in the Boiler Room of the Industrial Arts Building.

This differs from functional impulsivity which is a tendency to make quick decisions where this is optimal. As dysfunctional impulsivity is often associated with a failure to consider the consequences of one‚Äôs behavior, it can often lead to life difficulties.Dickman, S. J. (1990). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity: Personality and cognitive correlates. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58(1), 95-102.  Dickman Impulsivity Inventory  The distinction between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity was suggested by Scott J. Dickman in an article published in 1990. Before this, impulsivity was considered a complex construct that was made up of several different aspects. The Dickman Inventory classifies impulsivity into functional and dysfunctional categories. Many of the previously used impulsivity scales have been significantly correlated to measures of dysfunctional impulsivity. These include the impulsiveness scale of Eysenck‚Äôs Impulsivity Inventory (part of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire) as well as the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale.Cosi, S., Morales-Vives, F., Canals, J., Lorenzo-Seva, U., & Vigil-Colet, A. (2008). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in childhood and adolescence. Psychological Reports, 103, 67-76. Many of the questions used in the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory mirror those used on past questionnaires, and are used to assess overall impulsivity. Of the 23 questions on the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory, 12 of the items are used to measure dysfunctional impulsivity. This includes questions such as ‚ÄúI often get into trouble because I don‚Äôt think before I act‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúI often say and do things without considering the consequences‚Äù This scale has been adapted for use in children with similar results: clear distinctions between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity.Brunas-Wagstaff, J., Tilley, A., Verity, M., Ford, S., & Thompson, D. (1997). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in children and their relationship to Eysenck‚Äôs impulsiveness and venturesomeness dimensions. Personality and Individual Differences, 22(1), 19-35. It has also been translated into several languages, yielding similar results  Related constructs  Dysfunctional impulsivity is associated with both disorderliness and a tendency to ignore hard facts before making a decision. Individuals who are high in dysfunctional impulsivity are more likely to be punished for their behaviors.Smillie, L. D. & Jackson, C. J. (2006).

Delay discounting has been shown to be related to both dysfunctional and functional impulsivity.Mobini, S., Grant, A., Kass, A. E., & Yeomans, M. R. (2007). Relationships between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity, delay discounting, and cognitive distortions. Personality and Individual Differences, 43, 1517-1528.  Substance abuse  Impulsivity is significantly correlated with individuals being at a greater risk for substance abuse. Several studies have furthered this association to specifically relate dysfunctional impulsivity to this tendency. Binge drinkers were found to have significantly higher scores of dysfunctional impulsivity compared to control groups. The same study found no difference in levels of functional impulsivity between groups, indicating that dysfunctional impulsivity was the version of impulsivity that led to substance abuse.Adan, A. (2011). Impulsividad functional y disfuncional en jovenes con consume intensive de alcohol (binge drinking). [Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in young binge drinkers.] [Abstract]. Addicciones, 24(1), 17-22. This relationship with dysfunctional impulsivity has also been found in regards to cigarette smoking. Higher levels of dysfunctional impulsivity have been related to difficulty restraining oneself from smoking in inappropriate places, smoking without being aware of doing so, and overall craving for cigarettes.Pitts, S. R. & Leventhal A. M. (2012). Associations of functional and dysfunctional impulsivity to smoking characteristics.

Her work covers sociological issues including semiotics, capitalism, and feminism in Japan. Ueno is known for the quality, polarizing nature, and accessibility of her work. Early life and education Ueno was raised as a Christian, which she notes as being \\"very unusual\\" because only 1% of the Japanese population is Christian. Her father was a physician. In an interview with The Japan Times, she describes her father as \\"a complete sexist\\" who had extremely high expectations of her two brothers but only considered his daughter as a \\"pet girl\\", which allowed her the \\"freedom to do whatever I wanted to do\\". The marriage between Ueno's parents was unhappy, and her mother repeatedly fretted the difficulty that divorce would bring should she pursue it. Ueno would later describe monogamous marriage institutions as \\"the root of all evil\\". Ueno studied sociology at the University of Kyoto, where she participated in the Zengakuren student protests of the 1960s. Ueno has stated that during her time as a student, she faced sexual discrimination. Academic career Chizuko Ueno has spent her entire career advocating for equality of gender in the Japanese society by means of researching diverse issues of gender and contributing to the establishment of gender studies as an acknowledged field of research in Japan. In 1982, Ueno authored The Study of the 'Sexy Girl' („Çª„ÇØ„Ç∑„Ç£„Éª„ÇÆ„É£„É´„ÅÆÂ§ßÁ†îÁ©∂) and Reading the Housewife Debates (‰∏ªÂ©¶Ë´ñ‰∫â„ÇíË™≠„ÇÄ), texts that would be referred to as \\"The Flagbearers of 1980's Feminism\\". Her work investigated the relationship between the \\"Women's Lib\\" („Ç¶„Éº„Éû„É≥„Éª„É™„Éñ) movement of the 1960s and Women's Liberation Movement (Â•≥ÊÄßËß£ÊîæÈÅãÂãï) of the 1970s. The primary perspective of these works was the application of structuralist and semiotic theory to sociology in order to investigate gender-centric mechanisms in society. This public debate coincided with the prominence of other scholars such as Asada Akira, Nakazawa Shin'ichi, and Yomota Inuhiko, a period known as the New Academicism Boom („Éã„É•„Éº„Éª„Ç¢„Ç´„Éá„Éü„Ç∫„É†„Éª„Éñ„Éº„É†). After dropping out of her doctoral courses, Ueno worked in a marketing systems think tank and produced many works on the debates of consumption and society. From 1979 to 1989, she was a Lecturer and later Associate Professor at the Heian Women's College. She was an Associate Professor and Professor at the Kyoto Seika University at the Department of Humanities from 1989 to 1994. In 1993, after being rejected from many other universities as a strident feminist scholar, she received an invitation from the University of Tokyo. She is a special guest professor at the Graduate School of Core Ethics and Frontier Sciences at Ritsumeikan University and a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo. She retired from this position in order to take the role of Chief Director of the Women's Action Network (WAN), an organization designed to connect and introduce feminists from different backgrounds. The Women's Action Network website hosts news, essays, popular media reviews, and promotes certain merchandise. In 1994, Ueno received the Suntory Arts and Sciences award for her work, The Rise and Fall of the Modern Family. Scholarship and views Her research field includes feminist theory, family sociology, and women's history. She is best known for her contribution to gender studies in Japan. As a public intellectual, she played a central role in creating the field of gender studies in Japanese academia. Ueno is a trenchant critic of postwar revisionism and criticizes the whitewashing of Japanese history, which she claims attempts to justify its colonialism, wartime atrocities, and racism both before and after World War II. In particular, she has defended the compensation of Korean comfort women who were forced into prostitution by the Empire of Japan. She is also a staunch advocate of global women's reproductive rights, and a critic of monogamous marriage institutions. Ueno often discusses the semiotics and accessibility of feminism, claiming that feminist discussion in Japanese can frequently lack the language needed to make its concepts readily understandable and approachable. Moreover, Ueno has engaged in publicly provocative expressions and publications in order to invite dialogue on otherwise less-discussed feminist issues in the Japanese media, for which she has received both praise and criticism from other feminists. In the mid-1980s, Ueno was also involved in a public debate with Japanese eco-feminist Aoki Yayoi. Her work has argued that a key component of Marxist-Feminist thought is the recognition that sexism is an inherent, inseparable aspect of capitalist economies, and that sexism in the modern family does not owe its origins to pre-modern traditions, but rather is an acute product of post-industrial economic structure. Ueno has stressed the need for an accessible legacy of feminist thought.

Early years Brenner played high school football at Oceanside High School in California, where he was a two-time all- league selection and a second-team all-state selection as a senior in 2007. He was twice named his team's Most Valuable Offensive Lineman and played in the California All-Star Game following his senior season. He was named a scholar leader athlete by the Walter J Zable/ San Diego chapter of the National Football and College Hall of Fame. Additionally, he was a finalist in the county wide Silver Pigskin, the first offensive lineman ever so honored by the voting coaches and sports reporters. Brenner's team won the 2007 California Division II State Bowl. As a college prospect, Brenner was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 50 offensive guard in the country and the No. 88 overall prospect in the state of California. College career Although Brenner signed with the University of Utah in 2008, he did not enroll until January 2009. As a true freshman, Brenner played primarily on special teams in all 13 games and added 53 snaps on offense. As a sophomore in 2010, Brenner served as the team's top backup offensive lineman and started at left tackle in the team's Las Vegas Bowl loss to Boise State. Brenner started 12 games at right guard and one at tackle as a junior in 2011, grading out as the team's best offensive lineman in five games and ranking second on the team in total snaps despite exiting the season finale with a neck injury. As a senior in 2012, he started the first two games at right guard followed by 10 at left tackle, allowing just one sack on his way to second-team All-Pac-12 honors. Professional career=2013 NFL Draft At Utah's Pro Day prior to the 2013 NFL Draft, Brenner ran a 5.03 40-yard dash and did 29 bench reps of 225 pounds. He was regarded as a late-round or undrafted prospect, drawing style comparisons to Zane Beadles and T. J. Lang. After going undrafted in the 2013 NFL Draft, Brenner signed with the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent. Miami Dolphins Brenner entered his first pro training camp as the lone backup at center behind Mike Pouncey, facing competition from second-year guard Josh Samuda. He was released by the team during final cuts before the regular season and was re-signed to the practice squad on September 2. After 10 weeks on the practice squad, Brenner was promoted to the active roster, replacing offensive tackle Will Yeatman (placed on injured reserve with a torn ACL) and providing depth at center with starter Mike Pouncey listed as questionable for the team's Week 11 contest with an illness. On September 5, 2015, Brenner was waived by the Dolphins. On the following day, he was signed to the Dolphins' practice squad. On September 11, 2015, he was promoted to the Dolphins' active roster. On September 14, 2015, Brenner was waived by the Dolphins. On September 16, 2015, he was re-signed to the Dolphins' practice squad. On September 26, 2015, Brenner was promoted to the Dolphins active roster. On November 7, 2015, Brenner was waived by the Dolphins. On November 10, 2015, he was re-signed by the Dolphins. On November 17, 2015, Brenner was waived by the Dolphins.  Denver Broncos  On November 18, 2015, Brenner was claimed off waivers by the Denver Broncos from the Miami Dolphins. In the 2015 season, the Broncos made Super Bowl 50, but Brenner was inactive for the game. The Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers by a score of 24‚Äì10. Brenner was placed on injured reserve on August 5, 2016. Personal life Brenner is the son of Jim Brenner and Eileen Malik, both served in the United States Marine Corps. Brenner's father swam collegiately at the University of Buffalo, while his mother played soccer and lacrosse at Castleton State college and college basketball at Cal State San Bernardino. Brenner is bilingual with Spanish being his second language.

Civil service examinations consist of basic and/or advance arithmetic, money handling, word problems, and interpretation of graphs and statistics and focuses an abundant deal language skills. After the exam is administered, a chronologically ordered list is compiled based on candidate scores. Civil service testing was intended as an alternative to the patronage system.  Qualifications of a civil service department  In order to be considered as a civil service department: * A city must have a population of 10,000 or more, as determined either by the most recent federal decennial census, or by a more recent annual population estimate from the Texas demographer under Chapter 468. * The city must pay its police department, its fire department or both (143.002(a)(1)(B)). * At least 10 percent of registered voters in the city must have signed a petition to adopt Texas Chapter 143 (143.002(a)(1)(A)). A majority of votes is sufficient (143.004(c)). * Subsection 143.002(c) of provides that a civil service department will not be affected if the municipality‚Äôs population changes to no longer meet the population requirement. This appears to apply starting when the election to adopt occurs. * If at least one year has passed since the city adopted Texas Chapter 143, then a petition to require a popular vote to reverse that adoption may be validated by vote of at least 10 percent of registered voters in the city (143.004(e)) who also comprise 20 percent of the number of voters who voted in the most recent municipal election. If it is validated, the item to reverse adoption must appear on at the next municipal general election ballot. (143.004(d)). A majority of votes is sufficient (143.004(c)).ÀúÀúÀúÀú  Current issues  In 2013, City of Austin fire department underwent an investigation from the US department of justice in regards of alleged discrimination against minorities and their hiring process. The Fire Department has been ‚Äúengaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against Hispanics and African Americans with respect to employment opportunities in sworn positions.‚Äù In 2009, The Austin Fire Department fired down in its ranks to promote 2 untested lieutenants to newly created Assistant Chief positions, passing over a significant number of more experienced Captains, Battalion Chiefs, and Division Chiefs. The firm representing 2 long time AFD officers and the emergency responders for equality (an organization founded by concerned AFD fire fighters) to challenge AFD‚Äôs use of race in deciding whom to appoint to the new assistant chief position. Following mediation, the parties reached an amicable settlement awarding plaintiffs $850 thousand in damages and attorney fees. In addition to injunctive relieve. In November 2011, the Austin Fire Department spent close to $1 million to hire 80 new employees in responses to the discriminating allegations. The civil service test is intended to reduce the process of the Spoil System, but a promotion hinders on other aspects than that of a test score. There are allegations that subclasses of applications are at a disadvantage when it comes to the test.

According to the development team, \\"our long-term objective is to develop a general framework that supports the implementation of AARGs that are fun to play and also educational\\".Guiterrez et al., 2011 It utilizes Layar, an augmented reality smartphone application, QR codes located at particular real-world sites, or a phone's web browser, to facilitate games which require players to be in close physical proximity to predefined \\"nodes\\". A node, referred to by the developers as a Virtual Point of Interest (vPOI), is a point in space defined by a set of map coordinates; fAR-Play uses the GPS function of a player's smartphone‚Äîor, for indoor games, which are not easily tracked by GPS satellites, specially-created QR codes‚Äîto confirm that they are adequately near a given node. Once a player is within a node's proximity, Layar's various augmented reality features can be utilized to display a range of extra content overlaid upon the physical play-space or launch another application for extra functionality. Development and features fAR-Play's In-world Mapping ToolsfAR-Play began development in 2008, emerging from a collaborative project undertaken by a group of University of Alberta students from the Computer Science and Humanities Computing departments. fAR-Play is still under development, but a beta version is available for testing by request. fAR-Play's development is managed by a team of interdisciplinary professors and students at the University of Alberta. Currently, the developing team's roster includes Supervising Professors Geoffrey Rockwell and Eleni Stroulia, Developers Lucio Gutierrez and Matthew Delaney, and Website Developers Calen Henry and Garry Wong.fAR-Play.ualberta.ca: People Technology fAR-Play relies on a number of open- and closed-source web technologies as tools to create, and enhance the users' experience. Layar is the recommended client-side frontend for delivering game content to the player; it is available on Android and iOS, which covers over 91% of smartphones.Llamas et al., 2013 While Layar is not a requirement to play fAR- Play games, the application does supply additional augmented reality functionality; Layar also includes a built-in QR scanner. Depending on the design of the particular game, the player may instead use a dedicated QR code scanner; the developers recommend BeeTagg, but any such application will do. Layar or a QR code scanner are the maximum software requirements to play a fAR-Play game, making implementation of games on a wide variety of platforms relatively straightforward. fAR-Play games can also be designed for play strictly within a mobile phone's web browser. On the server side, fAR-Play's engine is composed of an Apache server which manages the system's web interface, including the mobile and desktop versions of the fAR-Play website, and a Java-based REST framework for managing the database of nodes. Features As a platform for designing AR games, as opposed to an AR game itself, fAR-Play offers little in the way of explicit shapes or patterns for games to take; instead, these elements are left to the game designer or players to develop. However, the nonspecific nature of nodes, the many options they offer for content delivery, and the open design of the platform are such that these elements can be developed extensively. Functionally, fAR-Play is a tool for tracking arbitrary points in space and a given player's proximity to them; what it does beyond that is up to the developers' and players' discretion. However, the fAR-Play website contains a leaderboard which tracks registered user's total scores.fAR-Play.ualberta.ca: Leaderboard Players are assigned levels based on their total score, ranging from Novice - Super Player. Player profiles will display nodes that the player has recently caught, and any achievements the player has gained. Additionally, players can share their adventure progress, achievements, and the capture of vPOIs on Facebook. How to play In order to participate in the locative aspects of fAR-Play games, users must have an Android or iOS mobile device and access to wireless internet. Players can participate in fAR-Play anonymously, or create and sign into a fAR-Play account. Those who choose to play anonymously will lose the ability to track their progress across multiple games. When signed in, the player is presented with a list of games that are currently available for play. Each game includes a brief description and the various \\"adventures\\" available to the player. Once the game has been started, the player has three different methods for capturing nodes: they may scan a QR in the physical space, discover a node through the Layar camera virtual view, or receive a link in their device's web browser.A Player's Guide to fAR-Play QR codes and Layar A QR code used in a fAR-Play game.QR codes can only be used as a method for capturing nodes and initiating games when there is a physical code present. In order to scan a QR code, players are required to have an application which can capture and recognize QR codes. If the player is utilizing a QR scanning application that has a built in browser, they will be required to log into fAR-Play through the app. Layar is a free to download augmented reality app, containing a built in QR code scanner, which enables its users to participate in fAR-Play games. Capturing nodes Layar permits the player to see nodes on their mobile device, guiding the player to their goal. Using this application, the player is able to navigate to their objective with map provided by Google Maps' API or by using their camera‚ÄîLayar overlays a virtual image onto the real-world scene presented by the camera. The representations on screen expand in size as the player approaches the node destination, simulating relative distance. If the player taps any of the nodes that are presented on the screen, they will be provided additional information about that node, including the node's name and a brief description. Nodes can be captured by tapping the \\"capture\\" button. Playing on browsers The player can also play fAR-Play games within their mobile device's browser. By visiting https://archive.is/20131123223038/http://farplay.ualberta.ca/far- play/ on a mobile device, players will be presented with a fully realized user interface, permitting full interaction with the games. The player can capture the in game vPOIs through their browser by tapping the \\"nodes\\" button. This will bring up a list of all the accessible nodes, complete with a brief description for each location. By clicking on one of the nodes, the player is shown to a screen with a mapped location of the vPOI, an in-depth description of it, and hints. At the top of the page, the player can tap \\"CAPTURE THIS NODE\\" and advance in the game. When attempting to capture a node, the developer may or may not associate a challenge with the node. For example, in the game \\"Zombies ate my Campus\\", when players are attempting to capture a node, they're presented with a multiple choice question associated with the current node. Game types Players complete an adventure when they have captured all of the nodes within it. fAR-Play provides two game modes: in a Virtual Scavenger Hunt, nodes must be captured in a specific order; in a Virtual Treasure Hunt, the order is unimportant. Existing fAR-Play games Games currently available through fAR-Play include:fAR-Play.ualberta.ca: Games *Giselle Ever After *Thought Hub *Comics Arts Capture Challenge *Pioneering Edmonton *The Intelliphone Challenge *A Tour of Atwater *Zombies ate my Campus For developers fAR-Play's ultimate goal is to provide a simple, effective platform for the creation of locative augmented reality games, but the developer tools are still under active development and not openly available to the public. Access can be granted on a case-by-case basis, however, and a developer's manual is available.fAR-Play Developers' Manual Users with development privileges can create new games or edit their existing games, in addition to playing their own or others' games. Adventures Games that are developed with fAR-Play are segmented into components called \\"Adventures\\". To progress through each game adventure, the player must reach and capture virtual points of interest, referred to in the game as vPOIs. In order to capture a vPOI, the player must travel to a physical location that is set by the developer. It is the developer's choice to include a challenge question to capture the vPOI, though it is not mandatory. A deduction of points can be implemented if the player submits an incorrect answer to a challenge question. Points and achievements Each of the nodes will reward the player with a predetermined number of points once they have been captured by the player. These points are added to the player's total points. Each of the adventures that are created require a predetermined number of vPOIs to be completed before the player can advance. fAR-Play has the ability to implement achievements, which can reward players with extra points for completing certain tasks. The two general classifications of achievements in the game are: \\"Percentage of Adventure Completed\\" and \\"Percentage of Game Completed\\".fAR-Play Developers' Manual Win conditions The developer must decide if the vPOIs must be completed in a certain order, or if the order is inconsequential. Additionally, the developer can choose if the win condition of an adventure requires all vPOIs to be captured, or only a certain percentage of them. Game creators can set a \\"Catch Limit\\" for each vPOI, which restricts the number of times each node may be captured. This can be used to encourage races and competitive play. Name, description and customization When developing a game for fAR-Play, the site requires that users submit a game name, game description, and game story. Each of the adventures within the game will also require a name, and type; Scavenger Hunt is currently the only available adventure type. For additional aesthetic customization, fAR-Play allows developers to utilize CSS to customize the appearance and layout of the player's interface. Hints The developer may implement a hint system within the game to guide players through the experience. These hints can take the form of an image, audio, or video file. To encourage the player to discover answers for themselves, the game can penalize players for the use of hints, reducing their points by a predetermined number.

After Wang Shenzhi's death and succession by Wang Shenzhi's biological son Wang Yanhan, Wang Yanbing, jointly with another biological son of Wang Shenzhi's, Wang Yanjun, overthrew Wang Yanhan to allow Wang Yanjun to rule Min. However, he later developed a rivalry with Wang Yanjun and tried to overthrow Wang Yanjun. His army was defeated by Wang Yanjun's, and he was captured and executed.  Background  It is not known when Wang Yanbing was born. It is also not known what his birth family's background was, other than that he was originally named Zhou Yanchen, or how and when he came to become an adoptive son of Wang Shenzhi's. One of his eyes was deformed or injured, such that he became known by a nickname of \\"single-eyed dragon\\" (). In 918, when Wang Shenzhi had already assumed the title of the Prince of Min as a vassal of Later Liang, Wang Yanbing was initially provisionally put in charge of the governance of Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian), and later officially made its prefect.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 98.  During Wang Yanhan's rule  Wang Shenzhi died in 925. His biological son Wang Yanhan took over the realmZizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. and, in 926, declared himself the King of Min, effectively declaring independence from Later Liang's successor state Later Tang. It was said that he did not value his relationships with brothers and, shortly after taking over from Wang Shenzhi, sent a younger brother, Wang Yanjun, out of the capital Fu Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) to be the prefect of Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian). He subsequently issued orders to both Wang Yanjun and Wang Yanbing, ordering them to find beautiful women to serve in his palace. Both Wang Yanjun and Wang Yanbing wrote back in rebuke, thus causing tension between them and him. Around the new year 927, Wang Yanjun and Wang Yanbing decided to jointly attack him. Heading down the Min River from Jian, Wang Yanbing reached Fu first, and defeated Wang Yanhan's general Chen Tao (). Chen committed suicide, and the city fell. Claiming that Wang Yanhan and his wife Lady Cui had murdered Wang Shenzhi by poison, he had Wang Yanhan publicly executed. Wang Yanjun arrived the next day, and Wang Yanbing welcomed him into the city and supported him as the acting military governor of Weiwu Circuit (Â®ÅÊ≠¶, headquartered at Fu Prefecture, i.e., the Min realm). (Thus, de jure, Min thus stopped being independent by this point and reverted to be a vassal of Later Tang, but was still de facto independent.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275.  During Wang Yanjun's rule  Shortly after, when Wang Yanbing was set to return to Jian, Wang Yanjun sent him off. As they were departing, Wang Yanbing stated to Wang Yanjun, \\"Carefully guard the base of our ancestors' accomplishments. Do not trouble me, your older brother, to come down again!\\" Wang Yanjun thanked him with humble words, but had a changed expression upon hearing the words. At some point, apparently at Wang Yanjun's request (after Later Tang's emperor Li Siyuan had bestowed the title of military governor of Weiwu on Wang Yanjun himself), Li Siyuan bestowed the title of military governor of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, traditionally headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan, which was then part of Later Tang proper) on Wang Yanbing. (The bestowment of the title was not itself recorded as having been Wang Yanjun's request, nor was its timing recorded in traditional histories, but the chronicle of Li Siyuan's reign in the History of the Five Dynasties recorded a subsequent bestowment of an additional honorific chancellor title of Shizhong on Wang Yanbing at Wang Yanjun's request in 929.)History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 40. Apparently just a month after receiving the Shizhong title, Wang Yanbing, apparently in a show of authority independent from Wang Yanjun's, directly petitioned Li Siyuan, requesting to retire on account of illness and that his territory be passed to his oldest son Wang Jixiong (). Li Siyuan granted the request and made Wang Jixiong the prefect of Jian.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In 931, hearing that Wang Yanjun was ill, Wang Yanbing launched an army and attacked Fu with Wang Jixiong, leaving his second son Wang Jisheng () in charge at Jian. Wang Yanbing attacked Fu from the west side while Wang Jixiong attacked Fu from the east side. A nephew of Wang Yanjun's and Wang Yanbing's, Wang Renda (), pretended to surrender to Wang Jixiong, and when Wang Jixiong was not paying attention, killed him and hanged his head high. When Wang Yanbing saw his son's head, he broke into tears, and his army collapsed. Wang Renda then attacked and captured him, presenting him to Wang Yanjun. Wang Yanjun stated to him, \\"Indeed, I have troubled you, older brother, into coming down again.\\" Wang Yanbing could not respond, and Wang Yanjun then put him under arrest and sent emissaries to Jian, trying to persuade Wang Yanbing's associates there to peacefully submit. Wang Yanbing's associates, however, killed Wang Yanjun's emissaries, and then escorted Wang Jisheng and a younger son of Wang Yanbing's, Wang Jilun (), to flee to Min's northern neighbor Wuyue. Wang Yanjun subsequently publicly executed Wang Yanbing and changed his name back to Zhou Yanchen, effectively disowning him as a family member.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277.  Posthumous recognition  However, two years later, in 933, Wang Yanjun built a temple dedicated to Wang Yanbing (and, presumably, restored his name and status as a family member), for reasons lost to history. He also posthumously created Wang Yanbing the Prince of Lingzhao. In 943, by which time Wang Yanbing's successor at Jian, Wang Yanzheng (another biological son of Wang Shenzhi's), then in rivalry with then-Min emperor Wang Yanxi, declared himself emperor of a new state of Yin, he further posthumously honored Wang Yanbing Prince Weisu of Wuping.

The roses in the middle distance are 'Kitty Kininmonth' and 'Amy Johnson'. The Alister Clark Memorial Rose Garden is the only complete collection in Australia of the surviving roses of \\"the great Australian rose breeder, Alister Clark\\" (1864‚Äì1949). It is situated near \\"Glenara\\", his old house and garden in Bulla, Victoria, 10 km NW of Melbourne Airport. There are at least 150 named roses by Alister Clark and many more plausibly attributed to him. Of these 83 are known to survive, though the authenticity of some is disputed and another eight only survive outside Australia. The garden is maintained by volunteers coordinated by the Hume City Council. Roses in the garden Below is an illustrated list of surviving Alister Clark roses in the Memorial Garden. Several related roses are also grown there. The list has been compiled from the brochure Alister Clark Memorial Garden of Hume City Council; and the online list established by Help Me Find Roses for Clark, Alister. Biographical detail comes from the Govanstones' The Women Behind the Roses. Further detail is from Susan Irvine's A Hillside of Roses. Roses putatively named after racehorses have been checked against the Pedigree Online Thoroughbred Database. 'Baxter Beauty' is the sport of an Alister Clark rose, not an Alister Clark rose itself. Nor is Rosa gigangtea, a species rose he frequently bred from. \\"Glenara No. 14\\", \\"Madge Taylor\\" and \\"Not Tonner's Fancy\\" (not shown) were found in his garden at \\"Glenara\\" and may be Clark roses.

The number used to be issued on a green plastic card, but since April 4, 2019 cards issuance was suspended and nowadays it is issued in electronic form only, while cards issued before this date are still valid. Anyone looking to get legal employment in the Russian Federation or to apply for benefits must have one. SNILS is used universally as a primary personal number within the government. Anyone residing in Russia on a permanent basis may apply for a number. An application can also be filed on behalf of a child at birth. SNILS is required for the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation to organize personal information about an employee and the amounts contributed by an employer to an employee's individual retirement account in respect of a future pension. The number is unique to each person. An individual's personal account contains all the data on insurance contributions accrued and paid by employers throughout a person's active employment. This is subsequently taken into consideration when pension benefits are first determined or adjusted. An insurance number is assigned automatically to simplify and expedite the process for determining an insurance retirement benefit. SNILS format is \\"123-456-789 12\\" where the first 9 characters can be any digits and the final two are a checksum.

It is found in a short section of the main stem of the Kern River and several tributaries in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains in California. The Kern River rainbow trout is a \\"Species of Special Concern\\" in the state of California due to habitat loss and hybridization with other native and non-native trout in their range. The Kern River rainbow trout is one of three subspecies of O. mykiss that are all endemic to the Kern River basin, sharing the headwaters of the river with the Little Kern golden trout and golden trout. Some of the existing range of the Kern River rainbow trout lies within the California Golden Trout Wilderness. Distribution Kern river rainbow trout are endemic to the Kern River and tributaries in Tulare County, California. Its current range is drastically reduced from its historic range. Remnant populations live in the Kern river above Durrwood creek, in upper Ninemile, Rattlesnake and Osa creeks, and possibly in upper peppermint Creek. Kern river rainbows have been successfully introduced into the Kaweah- Kern river and Chagoopa creek. Its historic range in the main stem of the Kern River it probably extended downstream below where Isabella Dam is today and upstream in the South Fork of the Kern River as far as Onyx creek. The subspecies has been extirpated in the Kern river from the Johnsondale bridge downstream. The Kern River trout hybridize with nonnative, introduced stocks of rainbow trout, and Behnke (2002) doubts that pure Kern River rainbow trout still exist in their historic range. Recent genetic analyses however suggest that some un-hybridized populations still exist.

Peter Schwalm (born 1970, Frankfurt am Main) is a German composer and music producer, active in the fields of electronic music, ambient, radio drama, film, theatre and ballet. He is best known for his work with musician Brian Eno. He lives and works in Frankfurt.  Biography  Schwalm studied at the Musikwerkstatt in Frankfurt am Main between 1989 and 1991, specialising in drumming. In 1993 he founded the experimental electro-jazz Projekt Slop Shop. Work from this project was released on the Frankfurt label Infracom. In 1996 Schwalm founded the label Poets Club Records, on which he released a series of 12\\" singles, as well as compilations of electronica, nu jazz and drum and bass. His first album with Projekt Slop Shop,Makrodelia, was released on the label in 1998, and caught the attention of a number of significant musicians such as Brian Eno, Peter Kruder and Ryuichi Sakamoto. As a result, Eno proposed a collaboration, which resulted, only a few months later, in an appearance together at the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, also featuring Holger Czukay, bass-player Raoul Walton and drummer Jem Atai. Schwalm and Eno continued to work together on a mixture of projects, including two albums, Music for Onmyo-Ji (2000 JVC Victor) and Drawn from Life (2001 Venture/Virgin Music U.K.). In addition Schwalm and Eno collaborated on a multi-channel sound installation in the crater of the Volcano del Cuervo on Lanzarote. Schwalm explained the concept and working method of this project in an Interview with the German music magazine Keyboards. In order to promote their album Drawn from Life, Schwalm and Eno undertook a tour in 2002, which took them as far afield as Japan, Spain and Portugal. Schwalm was also involved in Artists Against AIDS Worldwide, a project initiated by Bono, going under the title of what's going on. In 2003 Schwalm and Eno worked together on film music for Nicolas Winding Refn's Film Fear X. In 2006 Schwalm was involved in Wagner Reloaded, a project involving many different reworkings of Richard Wagner's music. Schwalm's contribution was performed by the Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra as part of the Punktfestival in Kristiansand, Norway. In the same year Schwalm released his first solo CD under his own name. The result Musikain, mixed a variety of music styles and incorporated the work of a number of guest vocalists, including Kari Kleiv, Imogen Heap and Eno himself.

The Arch of Hadrian (also called the \\"Arches of Capua\\" or the \\"Lucky Arch\\") is an ancient Roman triumphal arch located in Santa Maria Capua Vetere (ancient Capua, now in the Province of Caserta, southern Italy). It was originally a triple arch, but today only three pylons and one of the lateral arches survive. It spanned the Appian Way and constituted an ideal entrance to the city, perhaps corresponding to the line of the pomerium.Quilici - Quilici Gigli 2001, cited in bibliography, p.228. History The arch was erected between the latter half of the 1st century and the former half of the 2nd century, but we are ignorant of its dedication. An inscription was reported, with a dedication to the Emperor Hadrian, later determined to be false. Quilici Gigli 2001, cited in bibliography, p.228 A dedication to Septimius Severus was also dubiously reported (), but this probably belonged to the podium of a statue.Quilici Gigli 2001, cited in bibliography, p.228. It was hypothesised that the arch's erection occurred under the Flavian dynasty after the gift of the status of colonia to the city (along with the name Colonia Flavia Augusta).Quilici Gigli 2001, cited in bibliography, p.231. There was a restoration, with additions and reconstructions of the lateral structure in 1851. In 1860, it was involved in combat in the Battle of Volturnus: a commemorative plaque, with text written by Luigi Settembrini is located on one of the arch's pylons. Later, after 1893, the damage sustained during the battle was restored. Further restorations took place in both 1945 and 1953-1955 as a result of damage suffered in the Second World War. Description The arch is located between the Corso Moro and Via del Lavoro and is also known as the Arco di Adriano or Archi di Capua. The arch is constructed in brick (opus latericium) and originally had an outer coating of white limestone, now lost. The pylons of the central vault remain and one of the lateral arches. The remains extend to a height of 10 metres and a width of 18.5 metres. There are modern extensions and restorations. The arches of the central vault and of the lateral vaults were of a moderate height (6.2 metres), but that of the central arch was wider (an opening of 4.85 metres versus an opening of 3.95 metres for the lateral arches) and it originally reached to a greater height. The pylons are coated at the base with blocks of white limestone and are lightened by niches with arched tops. The holes in the lateral structure now allow the possibility of the presence of columns which framed the niches and must have supported an entablature which would have been above the vaults. It is believed the niches once held statues. On the inside of the pylons of the central passage are some niches, but these are modern recreations.

This locomotive is currently being restored to operating condition at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania as a part of their operating fleet for use on excursion trains. It is the focus of Project3713, a partnership between the National Park Service and the Lackawanna & Wyoming Valley Railway Historical Society. History=Design No. 3713 was one of five \\"P-4a\\" class heavy 4-6-2 \\"Pacifics\\" (Nos. 3710-3714) ordered by the Boston and Maine (B&M;) in December 1934 at the Lima Locomotive Works (LLW) in Lima, Ohio. These locomotives were originally built with smoke deflectors, a single air compressor mounted on their pilot deck, and a metal sky-lining shroud covering up the top of their boiler thus giving them a semi-streamlined appearance. In 1936, B&M; ordered the final batch of five Pacifics (Nos. 3715-3719) which were delivered in March 1937. These were the last Pacifics built by Lima to date. Slightly classified as P-4b, they were delivered with smoke deflectors, but without the sky-lining shroud. Designed with 80\\" drivers, a large firebox, and massive boiler, P-4 Heavy Pacifics would easily cruise at a speed of 70 miles per hour, carrying enough coal to pull a 14-car train for about 250 miles, and enough water to last about 125 miles. Due to wartime conditions with World War II, P-4s were all de-shrouded along with their smoke deflectors removed for easier maintenance. Around 1944 or 1945, a second air compressor was added on all of the locomotives' pilot deck. Namings B&M; sponsored the New England students a contest to name all five P-4a and five other P-4b after their schools. On December 11, 1937, No. 3713 was officially named The Constitution by J. Schumann Moore, a 14-year-old student from Eastern High School in Lynn, Massachusetts. Between 1940 and 1941, other winning names were selected to P-4a Pacifics No. 3710 as Peter Cooper, No. 3711 as Allagash, No. 3712 as East Wind, and No. 3714 as Greylock. While the P-4b Pacifics Nos. 3715 to 3719 were also named Kwasind, Rogers‚Äô Rangers, Old North Bridge, Ye Salem Witch, and Camel‚Äôs Hump, respectively. Each locomotives all have a plaque representing the students' name and their respective educated school. Restoration As of 1998, 3713 is currently undergoing a restoration to oparating condition.

Early life and military career He was born at Coole Glebe, Carnmoney, on 25 January 1816 ‚Äì the second son of Samuel Smythe, vicar of Carnmoney and of his wife Margaret, daughter of John Owens of Tildary. He was educated at Antrim until he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich on 11 November 1830. He received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 20 December 1833. In April 1835 he sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, where he served in the Kaffir War and received the war medal. He was promoted to be first lieutenant on 10 January 1837. He returned to England in October the same year. In July 1839 Smythe became secretary of the Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich, and filled the office until he embarked for St. Helena in December 1811 to take charge of the observatory at Longwood, and to carry out magnetical and meteorological observations under the direction of Captain (afterwards General Sir) Edward Sabine. The results were published in two large quarto volumes of Observations brought out by Sabine in 1850 and 1860. Smythe was promoted to be second captain on 5 May 1845. He returned to England in February 1847. In August 1848 Smythe embarked for Halifax where he was stationed for a year, returning to England in August 1849, on his promotion to the rank of first captain, dated 28 June. In January 1850 he was appointed by the Marquis of Anglesey to take charge of young officers of artillery on first joining at Woolwich, and to supervise their instruction. This new arrangement led to the establishment of the department of artillery studies, of which Smythe was the organiser, and became the first director until July 1852. He was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel on 1 April 1855. Royal Commission and marriage Having a good knowledge of French and German, Smythe was selected in October 1854 to superintend the execution of contracts for arms in Belgium and Germany. While still holding this appointment he was withdrawn temporarily from its duties by Lord Panmure, in January 1856, to act as a member of the royal commission sent to France, Russia, Austria, and Italy, to report on the state of military education in those countries, and to consider the best mode of reorganising the system of training British officers of the scientific corps. The other commissioners were Lieutenant-colonel William Yolland and the Reverend William Lake (afterwards dean of Durham); its secretary was Arthur Hugh Clough. Smythe advocated the entire separation of the education of the Royal Artillery from that of the Royal Engineers, a plan which Yolland opposed. In the end the report was drawn up by Lake and the secretary, Smythe signing \\"for the history and descriptions of foreign military schools only\\". The report, in two blue-books, was presented to Parliament in 1857. It is a mine of information, and records the well-weighed opinions of a large number of the most thoughtful officers of the time in both corps. Smythe now returned to the superintendence of the foreign contracts for arms until July 1857. He married, on 15 December 1857, at Carnmoney, Sarah Maria, second daughter of the Reverend Robert Wintringham Bland, JP There was no issue of the marriage. He was promoted to be brevet colonel on 1 April 1858, and the same year was a second time appointed director of artillery studies at Woolwich. In 1859 he was made a member of the ordnance select committee. Fiji In 1859 Smythe was selected to proceed to Fiji as commissioner to inquire into the circumstances of the cession of Fiji to England, which an English consul, Mr. W. T. Pritchard, had obtained from King Cakobau, and into the value of the group of islands from a strategical as well as a commercial point of view. The botanist, Dr. Berthold Carl Seemann, was attached to the mission. Smythe, accompanied by his wife, left England on 16 January 1860, taking with him complete sets of magnetical and meteorological instruments and charts. After experiencing some difficulty of transport owing to the war in New Zealand, he arrived in a small sailing vessel at Levuka on 5 July. He visited all the larger islands, and ascertained that there was no organised opposition to the cession; but he found that the representations made to government as to the value of the islands were in many substantial particulars incorrect, while Thakombau was in no sense king of Fiji. Foreseeing a tolerably long detention in the islands, Smythe brought with him to Levuka materials for a small house, which was erected, and part of it was fitted as an observatory. Here, from 12 Jan to 30 April 1861, he made regular magnetical and meteorological observations, including very careful determinations of magnetic declination, inclination, and force. Although not the first good observations made at Fiji, Smythe's are the most extensive and complete, and will probably long remain the standard of comparison. On 1 May 1861 Smythe made his report from Fiji, giving his opinion that it was inexpedient to accept the cession made by Cakobau. He arrived home, via Panama, in November of the same year. His report was presented to parliament in 1862 and was approved. His wife wrote a pleasant account of the expedition in a series of letters to friends at home, which was published in 1864 as Ten Months in the Fiji Islands with coloured illustrations and maps. To it Smythe contributed the introduction, an account of an excursion to Namosi in Viti Levu, and the appendix, containing his instructions and report, together with his magnetical and meteorological observations and remarks upon the Melanesian mission. Promotion On 5 August 1864 Smythe was promoted to be colonel in the Royal Artillery. The same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and was for some years a member of the meteorological committee of that society. In 1865 he went to India on military duty, returning to England on two years' leave of absence in the autumn of 1866. On 6 March 1868 he was promoted to be major-general, and returned to India in November. In December 1869 he finally came home, and lived at Tobarcooran at Carnmoney. He was promoted to be lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877, but remained unemployed. He was made a colonel-commandant of the Royal Artillery on 2 August 1880, and he was placed on the retired list, with the honorary rank of general, on 1 July 1881. Retirement and death Smythe's latter years were chiefly given to an earnest advocacy of home rule for Ireland so far as it was compatible with union with Great Britain. It was his constant endeavour to promote the material development of his country. He took an interest in agriculture, and devoted himself to the study, and encouragement of the study, of the Irish language. He died at Carnmoney on 12 July 1887. He erected in the churchyard of Carnmoney a lofty Irish cross of mountain limestone, designed from the finest examples extant, and probably the most beautiful specimen of Irish ecclesiastical art in the country. His grave is at the foot of this cross. He left by his will the reversion of ¬£3,000 to the Royal Irish Academy in trust, the interest of which was to be applied to the promotion of the use of the Irish language. He left also the reversion of an equal sum, together with his residuary estate, to the representative body of the church of Ireland. His widow survived him.

He attended Townsend Harris High School, and at age 15 entered City College of New York, studying art and psychology. He was active in student politics while at City College, protesting participation in the Reserve Officer Training Corps. In 1928 he attended the Art Students League, where he studied painting by Thomas Hart Benton, and drawing by Kimon Nicolaides. In 1932 he was among the leaders of New York students who traveled by bus to Kentucky in support of striking coal miners in Bell County. The bus carrying the students that LeBoit was on was turned around, and the students were escorted out of the state by the county prosecutor, Walter B. Smith, and sheriff's deputies. After crossing into Tennessee, LeBoit questioned Smith's authority in that state, resulting in his being beaten by the deputies in reprisal.Robert Cohen, When the Old Left Was Young: Student Radicals and America‚Äôs First Mass Student Movement, 1929-1941 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 50-51. Artistic career=WPA years During his twenties, LeBoit (who had changed his name, along with his sister, Shirley, a commercial artist) developed skills as a draftsman, printer's devil and lithographer. In the mid-1930s, Joseph Lebowitz changed his last name to LeBoit; whether this was to avoid anti-semitism, or to capitalize on interest in French artists is not known. He was drawn to graphic arts, which he believed to be more democratic than painting, as works could be widely disseminated and inexpensive. In 1935 he joined the Graphic Arts Project of the Works Progress Administration.Helen Langa, Radical Art: Printmaking and the Left in 1930s New York, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2004, p. 230 Under these auspices he produced about 25 lithographs, etchings and woodcuts, some in the style of social realism, others presenting urban life in New York City. He had an administrative role in the Silk Screen Unit under the direction of Anthony Velonis, from 1938 on. Three silk screen prints by LeBoit appear in an article on the early history of that medium.Reba Williams, David Williams, The Early History of the Screenprint, Print Quarterly, vol. 3, no. 4 (December 1986, pp. 287-321) During this time he married Lilian Moore, a teacher and children's author, whose works include the Little Raccoon series; the latter was among the most widely published in children's literature in the former Soviet Union. World War II years In the years before American entry into World War II, LeBoit was struck by the irrelevance of esthetically driven art. His best known work, Tranquility (1936Tranquility, Joseph LeBoit(1936) depicts an artist wearing a gas mask, with two dogs at his feet, calmly completing a cubist painting while through a window, the viewer sees planes flying over the ruins of a town. This work was included in the exhibit \\"Facing Fascism\\" at the Museum of the City of New York in 2007 and in the exhibition ‚ÄòThe American Scene: Prints from Hopper to Pollock‚Äô at the British Museum in 2008.Stephen Coppel, The American Scene: Prints from Hopper to Pollock (London: British Museum Press, 2008), 30, 200-201. Tranquility was cited by museum director Neil MacGregor as ‚Äòas well as referencing the great names and artistic currents it allows you to read a whole other set of narratives about the history of twentieth-century America.‚Äô.Neil MacGregor: interview, Time Out:London, April 1, 2008 http://www.timeout.com/london/attractions/neil-macgregor-interview However, the critic Robert Hughes grouped Tranquility with many of the prints from the exhibit as overly literary and lacking in artistic skill, calling it \\"indignantly quaint in a cartoony way.Robert Hughes View From the Street:The Guardian, April 11, 2008 https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/12/art.architecture\\" Continuing his engagement in leftist politics, LeBoit was involved, in 1942 in the foundation of the Artists' League of America and in that of Artists for Victory. The latter organization eventually enrolled over 10,000 artists, and held exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at military hospitals in support of the United States effort in World War II. Part of the program of the organization was advocacy of the Western allies opening a second front to relieve pressure on the Soviet Union. As head of the Graphic Arts committee for Artists for Victory, LeBoit organized the exhibit \\"America in the War\\", which opened in 26 American museums on October 20, 1943.Ellen G. Landau, Artists for Victory (exhibition catalog) Washington DC: Library of Congress, 1983, p. 64 His woodcut, Herrenvolk currently in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and of the Library of Congress was entered in the section of the exhibit called \\"The Nature of the Enemy\\" and depicts two Nazi soldiers eating and drinking next to the corpse of a woman. While not a member of the Communist Party of the United States, LeBoit knew many of its leaders, and was sympathetic to their views. His illustrations appeared in the communist periodical, New Masses and in Art Front. During the war, he was also employed as a staff artist for the left-leaning evening newspaper, PM contributing cartoons, sketches and maps. Among other artists at PM at the time were Theodor Geisel, later known as Dr. Seuss and Ad Reinhardt, one of the founding Abstract Expressionists. LeBoit also exhibited at the ACA gallery in New York City around this time. Later life Following the end of the war, employment became increasingly difficult for those with Communist affiliations, and LeBoit, rather than undergo the background checks attendant on being a staff artist in mainstream media retrained as a psychologist and psychoanalyst. He co-founded the Jamaica Center for Psychotherapy, later called the Advanced Center for Psychotherapy in New York City, under the precept that psychoanalytic psychotherapy should be available to the working class. He edited one of the first books on borderline personality disorder during this period.Joseph LeBoit, Attilio Capponi (eds.) Advances in the Psychotherapy of the Borderline Patient, Joseph Aronson, New York, 1979 He served as Executive Director for almost 25 years, retiring after a stroke at age 81. During this period, and even after the stroke he continued to paint, but never went back to graphic arts.

In 1940 she married Arthur Useldinger, a senior figure in the Communist Party. In 1941 she was arrested by the Gestapo, but was released due to a lack of evidence against her. A year later, by which time she had become pregnant, she was arrested again, with her parents and brother. Her daughter, Fernande, was born in a jail in Trier. In late June 1943 she was deported to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, where she later became a member of an illegal underground organisation. Her father was deported first to Hinzert concentration camp, later to Mauthausen; her brother was sent to Dachau. Her mother was released, and took care of Yvonne's baby. Yvonne Useldinger was transferred in December 1944, from Ravensbr√ºck camp to a secondary camp, which had been built nearby by Siemens. After Ravensbr√ºck was liberated by the Red Army, Useldinger was in late April 1945 evacuated to Sweden by the Swedish Red Cross. Shortly after, she returned to Luxembourg.

History  40 was ordered by the Lancaster and Chester Railroad of Lancaster, South Carolina from the Baldwin Locomotive Works and was completed on December 2, 1925. Very little is known about 40's career on the Lancaster & Chester other than that it was primarily used to haul textiles. In 1947, 40 was sold to the 3.7 mile long Cliffside Railroad, a short line in North Carolina. During its entire tenure on the Cliffside, the relatively diminutive 80-ton 2-8-0 was the largest locomotive the railroad owned. In 1962, the Cliffside Railroad sold the 40 to Steam Trains Inc., located in New Hope, Pennsylvania. 40 was moved to the Reading Company shops in St. Clair, PA with the rest of Steam Trains Inc.'s equipment, including their other steam locomotive, Canadian National Railway 4-6-0 No. 1533. In 1966, Steam Trains Inc. was reorganized as the New Hope & Ivyland Railroad and moved all of its equipment, including 40, to the former Reading Company yard in New Hope, PA. Even though 40 was operational at the time, it only saw limited service in the summer of 1967 as stablemate 1533 was reportedly easier to run and fire and was more popular with engine crews. In 1974, 40 was rebuilt by the New Hope & Ivyland's new owners, the McHugh Brothers and returned to service. In the late 1970s in addition to 40 being taken out of service for repairs, the New Hope and Ivyland's passenger operations were handed over to the newly formed New Hope Steam Railway. From 1981 to 1986, 40 was the New Hope Steam Railway's workhorse, pulling the majority of their trains until the group's leadership changed in late 1986. In 1990, the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad came under new ownership and 40 was rebuilt to operational condition by shop forces from the Strasburg Rail Road, returning to operation in June 1991.

The Mirror of Alchimy is a short alchemical manual, known in Latin as Speculum Alchemiae. Translated in 1597, it was only the second alchemical text printed in the English language. Long ascribed to Roger Bacon (1214-1294), the work is more likely the product of an anonymous author who wrote between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries. History The Mirror of Alchimy is a translation of earlier works found in Latin and French. The earliest known manuscript copy is in Latin and dates from the fifteenth century. It was published as Speculum Alchemiae in Johannes Petreius' De alchimia. This was the first alchemical compendium, and was printed in Nuremberg in 1541. The volume also included five works attributed to Geber, the works of Calid and Ortolanus, and three other texts. Portions of De alchimia were translated into French in 1557 as Le miroir d'alquimie. The French volume was published in four parts. Speculum Alchemiae was translated by Nicolas Bernard and appears in French at the beginning of part one. Here, Pseudo-Bacon's work is featured alongside the texts attributed to Hortulanus and Calid from the Latin edition. The series also included a second work attributed to Roger Bacon, De l'admirable puissance del'art, & de nature, ou est traict√© de la pierre philosophale. Three additional works attributed to Jean de Mehun, Claude Celestin, and Pope John XXII were also incorporated.Maggs Bros. Ltd. listing The English version of The Mirror of Alchimy was translated from the French and printed at London in 1597. Just three of the appended texts found in Le miroir d'alquimie were retained for the English book. The work was printed by Thomas Creede (fl. 1593-1617) for the publisher Richard Olive. In 1602, the Latin version of Speculum Alchemiae appeared in Volume II of the influential Theatrum Chemicum. Contents On the title page the publisher describes the book as The mirror of alchimy, composed by the thrice-famous and learned fryer, Roger Bachon. Also a most excellent and learned discourse of the admirable force and efficacie of Art and Nature, written by the same Author. With certain other worthie treatises of the like argument. In the first chapter pseudo-Bacon describes alchemy as a science teaching how to make and compound a certain medicine, which is called Elixir, the which when it is cast upon metals or imperfect bodies, does fully perfect them in the very projection. The author then goes on to describe the seven metals and the method for creating the elixir. It is a short treatise broken into seven chapters, some of which are only a paragraph long: # Of The Definitions Of Alchemy # Of The Natural Principles, And Procreation Of Minerals # Out Of What Things The Matter Of Elixir Must Be More Nearly Extracted # Of The Manner Of Working, And Of Moderating, And Continuing The Fire # Of The Quality Of The Vessel And Furnace # Of The Accidental And Essential Colours Appearing In The Work # How To Make Projection Of The Medicine Upon Any Imperfect Body The following alchemical writings are appended to Pseudo-Bacon's tract in the 1597 edition: *The Commentary of Hortulanus, upon the Smaragdine table of Hermes, the father of Philosophers. *The Booke of the Secrets of Alchimie, composed by Galid the sonne of Yazich. (See: Khalid Ibn Yazid) *An excellent discourse of the admirable force and efficacie of Art and Nature, written by the famous Frier Roger Bacon. (The connection of the historical Roger Bacon to this text is also suspect.) Influence The Mirror of Alchimy appeared at a time when there was an explosion of interest in Bacon, magic and alchemy in England. The evidence of this is seen in popular plays of the time such as Marlowe's Dr. Faustus (c. 1588), Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay (1589), and Jonson's The Alchemist (1610). It was one of only two alchemy books printed in English in the sixteenth century, preceded by George Ripley's The Compound of Alchymy in 1591. Alchemical texts were previously available in sixteenth century England, but only in Latin or manuscript form. Stanton Linden writes that the description of exoteric alchemy found in this widely distributed text defined the discipline as \\"Corporal Science\\" and reinforced its longstanding association with metallurgy and goldsmithing. About this work, John Maxson Stillman wrote that \\"there is nothing in it that is characteristic of Roger Bacon's style or ideas, nor that distinguishes it from many unimportant alchemical lucubrations of anonymous writers of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries\\". M. M. Pattison Muir had a similar opinion, and Edmund Oscar von Lippmann considered this text a pseudepigraph.

The band incorporates elements of darkwave, post-punk, synthpop, shoegaze, and ethereal music to create a dreamlike trance throughout their sound. Bella Lune cites many 80s post-punk and new wave bands as influences, including The Cure, Joy Division, Depeche Mode, Cocteau Twins, New Order, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, and Love and Rockets.  History =Abstracted Visions (2007-2009) Bella Lune originated when lead singer/songwriter Fuchsia Angel met former guitar player and songwriter Kal3id. After discovering they had similar tastes in music, Bella Lune took shape. The band's first album, Abstracted Visions, was released in 2007 on the band's own record label, Aetheria Music. The album drew comparisons by critics to bands like The Cure, The Birthday Massacre, Cocteau Twins, and Switchblade Symphony. Abstracted Visions relies on delicate synth and guitar patterns to weave somber and ambient atmospheres. The band also released music videos for three songs--\\"Transmissions,\\" \\"Neverwhere,\\" and \\"Blissful Escape.\\" Hurley was recruited in 2008 to play synths and help with production. In 2009, the band was listed in Music to Die For: The International Guide to Today's Extreme Music Scene, written by Mick Mercer. Violinist, Beeka, made her live debut when Bella Lune opened for Nitzer Ebb, on their Industrial Complex tour. Synesthesia (2010-2012) Synesthesia, the group's second album, was released in 2010. In the same footsteps of their debut, Synesthesia drew further comparisons to bands well known within dark alternative circles. It also opened them up to a larger, international audience. Drummer, R. Duke, joined the live lineup in 2010. The band created music videos for \\"The Dolly Pop Song\\" and the fan favorite \\"Ophelia.\\" Following the release of Synesthesia, Bella Lune embarked on a tour in Japan, with a headline performance in Tokyo. Prior to the tour, Dy was recruited to play guitar, completing the live ensemble. In 2011, Bella Lune released an EP called Ophelia, featuring remixes by artists, including Daniel Myer. It also has a cover of Dead Souls by Joy Division. The band was featured in Issue 7 of Giuseppina Magazine and photographed by Brandy Caldwell. Fuchsia and Dy appeared on the cover of Echo Magazine's 2011 Halloween Issue. Fuchsia was featured in the Breast Cancer Awareness Issue of Giuseppina Magazine, where she was commended for donating her hair to the charity Locks of Love. Fuchsia also appeared in the special Halloween edition of Giuseppina Magazine, with a pictorial by photographer Brandy Caldwell. In 2012, Bella Lune embarked on their first European Tour, which ended with a headline performance in Whitby, England at the Bram Stoker Film Festival. Heinz Ehlmann wrote about Bella Lune in Issue 74 of Gothic Magazine. The song \\"Ophelia\\" was included on the magazine's Gothic Compilation Part LIV. Lead singer, Fuchsia, was published in several fashion magazines in 2012, including Bella Morte Magazine, LA Hot Magazine, and Vedere Magazine. Secrets and Tranzendance (2013-2016) The third album Secrets, released in 2013, saw a shift in direction, toning down the electronics and bringing a more organic sound to the forefront. The last track on the album is a live mix of \\"Transmissions,\\" featuring heavier guitars and percussion, as well as a violin outro. This is the last album to feature founding member Kal3id. In August 2013, Fuchsia was on the cover of the Phoenix New Times Magazine, titled \\"Rock of Ages\\". Fuchsia was also on the cover of Carpe Nocturne Magazine, and interviewed for the article \\"An Evening With Bella Lune\\". Fuchsia and Hurley spent 2014 in the studio writing, recording and producing their fourth full-length album 'Tranzendance'. Bella Lune also contributed a song to the charity compilation DeathMass Six in 2014, to help feed hungry LGBT families. On January 31, 2015, Bella Lune released their fourth studio album Tranzendance, which incorporated more danceable, modern electronic elements to their sound. Bella Lune joined forces with Mike Jenney, of Alter Der Ruine, who contributed percussion and additional production on the album. A portion of the proceeds from the album sales are being donated to musicandmemory.org, which helps elderly alzheimer's patients in nursing homes through music therapy. In June 2015, Bella Lune headlined a dark electronic showcase at the Crescent Ballroom in Phoenix. The band added a new visual element to their set for 2016, which was created by visual artist NyQ Bonaventura. In the fall of 2015, Bella Lune was included on Side Line Music Magazine's Face The Beat Vol. 2 compilation. They opened for Keep Shelley In Athens, from Greece, at Valley Bar in November 2015. Bella Lune was also included on the final 'DeathMass Six' charity compilation in December 2015. In 2016, Fuchsia and Hurley began writing their fifth studio album. Fuchsia and Hurley also took to the dance floor in 2014, by contributing their DJ/mixing skills to events like Club Shadowplay, AZ Vampire Ball, Fetish Ball events, and Spellbound Burlesque. Bella Lune performed live at the Sinful Dreams fetish event in June 2016, and brought back long time drummer, R. Duke, to be a guest for two special shows. They also added a new keyboardist, Lenore, to the live line-up just on time for their show at Bar Sinister in Los Angeles on July 23. Lenore's Arizona debut with Bella Lune was at Club Red in Mesa, AZ on December 6, opening for Toronto synthpop act Ayria and London based Inertia. Covers Vol. 1 and Stardust (2016-2019) As Fuchsia and Hurley wrote their fifth studio album, they continued to DJ frequently. The group started a regular dance night in the Phoenix area called Club Nocturne in January 2017, which continues to grow in popularity. They also became the resident DJ at Spellbound Burlesque. On October 1 2018, Bella Lune released an album of covers appropriately titled 'Covers Vol. 1', which includes covers originally done by Cocteau Twins, New Order, Siouxsie And The Banshees, Massive Attack, Led Zeppelin and others. By Summer of 2019, they had finished 'Stardust', which features more live band members than ever before. The album will be released in Summer 2019, and more live shows will be scheduled. To Be Continued...

Biography In 1858 Serra began studies at the Collegio Artistico Venturoli, working first under Gaetano Serrazanetti and then under Luigi Busi. In 1863 he was admitted the Bolognese Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied under Giulio Cesare Ferrari, Antonio Puccinelli, and Salvino Salvini, and in 1865 he received a medal for painting. In 1866, he won the Angiolini Stipend, a prize that allowed him to travel to Florence. In Florence, he was a companion of Raffaele Faccioli, with whom he shared an award in 1866. The last years of his scholarship (1869-1870) led him to move to Rome. In Florence, he had befriended the circle of Macchiaioli painters who frequented the Caff√® Michelangiolo; yet, unlike those painters, Serra practiced in a Purismo style recalling Quattrocento painters like Francesco del Cossa, Andrea del Castagno, Verrocchio, and Pollaiolo.Galleria d'arte moderna Ricci-Oddi of Piacenza, short biographies of artists in collection. In the early 1870s Serra joined a city council for education led by Giosue Carducci and Raffaele Belluzzi. Serra along with the lawyer Ulisse Sartori, represented the Societies of Artists and Fine Arts. In 1870 at Parma, he exhibited: Annibale Bentivoglio, prisoner in the Castle of Varano. In 1877 Serra moved to Rome, the following year he began studies for the large painting Entry of the Catholic Army into Prague (event occurring after the Battle of White Mountain) for the apse of the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria. That church was founded in celebration of that event. In 1883, he exhibited that painting in Rome. Among his watercolors: Mezzogiorno; Dal Colosseo (1884, exhibited at Mostra of Fine Arts in Turin); and the sketch San Carlo ai Catinari. In 1873, accompanied by Mario De Maria, Paolo Bedini, and Raffaele Faccioli, Serra travelled to the International Exposition of Vienna. In 1874 he travels to Turin, and meets Marco Calderini, and the next year wins another three-year stipend. In 1875, after three years, Serra finished his Allegory of the Arts for the sipario (theater curtain) for Theater of Fabriano. In 1880, he returned to finish further painting of allegorical figures for the ceiling of the Theater Gentile in Fabriano. Back in Rome, displayed some sketches in the competition for the decoration of the so-called \\"Yellow Hall\\" of the Senate. Despite the considerable efforts made by Serra, studying Roman history and making preparatory sketches, he lost the commission to Cesare Maccari. In 1882 his Apparition of the Virgin to Saints Francis and Bonaventure, commissioned by the Padri Reformati of the Church of the Crucifix located on via del Cestello, Bologna. Between 1882 and 1883 Serra was collaborator under the pseudonym L'imbianchino to the magazine Cronaca Bizantina published by Angelo Sommaruga. Serra continued to publish articles and correspondences for periodicals until 1877. In 1881, Serra was appointed academic correspondent of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna. In 1888, he also exhibited in Bologna paintings depicting antique sites demolished in Rome with urban renewal. In 1884, his portrait of Signora Deserti, despite four months of effort, was declined. He also lost a commission for painting the Stations of the Cross for the church of San Gioacchino in Turin. In 1884 he submitted two watercolors at the Turin Exposition. By 1885, he had moved to Rome, painted the canvas I Coronari, sold through the Florentine Gallery of Luigi Pisani. In 1886, he painted a large tempera canvas depicting Irnerius glosses (elucidates) the Justinian Code for the ceiling of the council chamber of the Province of Bologna located in the Palazzo d'Accursio. In 1888 he completes the portrait of Mrs. Enrica Whiting and studies for a painting St John of Nepomuk, commissioned by Prince Torlonia for the family chapel in San Giovanni Laterano.Exhibited at 1888 National Exposition at Bologna, but John of Nepomuk work never completed.

Family He was the son of judge royal Paul (d. before 1271) and an unidentified mother from the Gy≈ër clan, who was a granddaughter of palatine Pat Gy≈ër. He had three brothers ‚Äì Stephen, Geregye II, Eth II ‚Äì and a sister, Agnes who married Turul Nagymih√°lyi and after her husband's death, she joined to the monastery at Margaret Island. Nicholas' grandfather was voivode Eth I. As Geregye and Eth appeared in contemporary records decades later at the turn of the 1270s and 1280s than their elder brothers, historian Attila Zsoldos considers they were children from a supposed second marriage of Paul Geregye. There is no information about Nicholas' any wives or descendants. Duke Stephen's partisan Nicholas and his brother Stephen were first mentioned by a royal charter in 1256, when B√©la IV of Hungary obliged their father Paul to return certain acquired lands along the Sebes-K√∂r√∂s: Telegd, Szabolcs, Sonkolyos and Bert√©ny with its royal customs (today Tileagd, SƒÉbolciu, »òuncuiu»ô and Birtin in Romania, respectively) to the original owners. In the previous year, the Geregye troops seized the landholdings of the neighboring Csan√°d clan; it is plausible that both Nicholas and Stephen had participated in the skirmhish. According to a 1278 charter, Paul and his sons unlawfully possessed the land of Sz√©kelyh√≠d (today SƒÉcueni, Romania) too. Following these lawless deeds, Paul became disgraced in the royal court and never held any dignities or positions anymore. In this context, Nicholas and Stephen belonged to the partisans of Duke Stephen, whose relationship with his father B√©la IV deteriorated by the early 1260s. It is possible Nicholas was identical with that namesake courtier, who served as count (head) of the ducal household in 1259. Around the same time, his brother Stephen was isp√°n of Vas County in 1260. Following that Nicholas functioned as voivode of Transylvania between 1267 and 1268, during the end of the reign of B√©la IV (it is presumable, he held the dignity uninterruptedly from 1264 to 1270). The voivodeship belonged to the realm of Duke Stephen, who even adopted the title junior king in the second half of the 1260s. The Geregye brothers supported the duke in the civil war conflict between father and son, which evolved in 1264‚Äì65. It is possible that they fought in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265, as one of Nicholas' castle warriors from Vas County was granted the status of royal servants for his military merits in the battlefield by Stephen. Historian Attila Zsoldos considers their lands' geographical proximity to the ducal court in Transylvania, and their father' Paul deteriorating relationship with B√©la IV both contributed to their involvement in the rebellion against the royal power. Aspirations to oligarchy The Geregye brothers' loyalty to Duke Stephen suddenly broke up in May 1270, when the latter ascended the throne and became King of Hungary as Stephen V. Nicholas, along with several magnates, fled the country and placed himself under the protection of Ottokar II. The Bohemian king also received the Dobronya Castle at Dobr√≥v√°ralja, Upper Hungary (today Podz√°mƒçok, Slovakia) by Nicholas. He participated in Ottokar's campaign against Hungary in 1271, when Nicholas besieged and occupied the Nyitra Castle and came through on the Garam River. After the peace treaty between Stephen V and Ottokar II (1271), he returned to Hungary, however he regained his former political influence only after the death of king Stephen V in 1272. Between 1272 and 1274, during the reign of the minor Ladislaus IV, Nicholas was voivode of Transylvania and thus isp√°n (comes) of Szolnok County three times. He was elected judge royal and head of B√°nya (√Årkib√°nya) isp√°nate in 1275. He actively participated in the struggle for power between the barons and supported the K≈ëszegi family and Joachim from the Gutkeled clan. Nicholas and his brothers tried to establish a dominion independently of the king. Nicholas had started to expand his influence over the territories that surrounded his possessions and castles, Adorj√°n, Alm√°s, S√≥lyomk≈ë and Valk√≥. However king Ladislaus IV eliminated their rebellion with a military force in 1277. After that the Geregye clan lost its estates and political positions.

It is the entrance to the city by the via Flaminia, which became the inside of the wall of the decumanus maximus. It is one of the symbols of the city. History The Arch of Augustus, intact, in the bass-relief of the facade of the neighbouring church of St Michael In the Roman period it was the principle gate of Colonia Julia Fanestris, a colonia established in the town of Fanum Fortunae (temple of Fortuna) by the Roman architect Vitruvius at the command of the Emperor Augustus, in commemoration of the victory over the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal Barca in the Battle of Metauro during the Second Punic War. It is presumed that at least two other (now lost) gates existed in Fanum Fortunae, one to the south and the other near the sea. Constructed at the point at which the Via Flaminia met the decumanus maximus of the city, the monument is dated to AD 9 by means of an inscription located on the frieze, with large characters carved in the rock which were once gilded in bronze. The inscription reports: The arch was later rededicated by the Emperor Constantine I with a new inscription on the attic which is now lost, but the earlier inscription was not erased.Silvio De Maria, Gli archi di Roma e dell'Italia romana, Roma 1988, pp.242-243. In 1463, during the siege of the city in order to expel its lord Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, the artillery of Federico da Montefeltro, destroyed the attic of the monument. The fallen fragments were reused in the construction of the adjacent church and loggia of Saint Michael. The original appearance of the gate is recorded in the Renaissance bass relief carved on one side of the facade of the church. Description Photograph at night. Faced with opus quadratum from blocks of Istrian stone, the monument consists of two minor lateral arches and a larger central arch; the keystone of the latter is decorated with an image of an animal, which is no longer recognisable but which most probably depicted an elephant. The main body, still well preserved, supported a large attic which is now lost, with a Corinthian pseudo-portico, in which there were seven arched windows separated by eight pseudo-columns. The whole monument has many stylistic similarities with the Augustan gates of Spello, Aosta and particularly with Authon in Provence.

Education  Goody studied Chemistry at the University of Birmingham, England, where he was awarded a PhD in 1968 for studies on the chemistry of cytosine. Career and research After his PhD, Goody was appointed a postdoctoral researcher at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, NY, USA in the field of natural products research. In 1970 he became a scientific fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine, G√∂ttingen in the field of nucleotide research. From 1972 till 1993 he was a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg in the field of enzymology and nucleotide research, with a focus on actin, myosin, adenylate kinase, EF- Tu, HRAS-p21, reverse transcriptase, nucleotides and nucleic acid sequencing. An overriding theme of his research interests has been the transient states of enzymes, along the enzyme reaction pathway, against the background of selective and specific ligand-protein interactions and structure-function relationships. In 1983 he habilitated at the faculty for biochemistry and biophysics of the University of Heidelberg and was announced adjunct professor in 1990. In 1993 he accepted the position of Director at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology, Dortmund and became a scientific fellow of the Max Planck Society. Since 2004 Roger Goody has also held a full professorship in biochemistry (supramolecular systems) at the Ruhr University Bochum, with a dual emphasis on higher education and fundamental research. Roger Goody has combined chemistry, structural biology and kinetics to make major contributions in several fields of biology. He pioneered the use of nucleotide analogs, synthesized at the beginning of his career, in muscle research and later for Ras-family GTPases, leading to the first ever structure determination of an unstable protein-substrate complex (Ras:GTP). Innovative use of semi-synthetic proteins led to an understanding of transport mechanisms of Rab GTPases and to resolution of a longstanding controversy concerning targeting of these proteins to membranes. His group discovered and characterized hitherto unrecognized covalent modifications of Rab proteins by bacteria.

He was part of the Freedom Movement and played an important role during the Sylhet referendum which led to its merger with East Bengal. As member of Pakistan's Second Constituent Assembly he demanded the recognition of Bengali as one of the national languages of Pakistan and advocated the cause through his newspaper, the Nao Belal. He strongly opposed the 'One Unit' scheme and voted against the merger in 1956. After the dissolution of the assembly and abrogation of the 1956 Constitution he worked towards the restoration of provinces and a parliamentary form of government based on adult franchise.  Early life and family  Mahmud Ali was born on 1 September 1919, in Alimabagh, Sunamganj, Sylhet District in a prominent family of lawyers, writers and politicians. His father, Moulvi Mujahid Ali was a writer, poet and law graduate from the Aligarh Muslim University. His uncle Moulvi Munawwar Ali served as a minister in the Government of Assam under the then Chief Minister Sir Syed Muhammad Saadullah until 1946, and later as a member of the East Bengal Legislative Assembly. Mahmud Ali's grandfather and head of the Ali family, Moulvi Musharraf Ali, originally hailed from Shahbazpur, Comilla, where some of his ancestors had served as Mir ul Bahr (Commander in Chief) of the Imperial Navy in the Padma region of Bengal under the Emperor of Delhi. Mahmud Ali matriculated from the Sunamganj Government Jubilee High School in 1937 and studied at the MC College, Sylhet. He continued his studies in St. Edmunds College and St. Anthony's College and graduated with honours in English in 1942. After graduation he studied law at Calcutta University but did not continue his studies due to his involvement in the Freedom Movement.  Freedom Movement = All India Muslim League  Mahmud Ali was elected as the first student President of the Assam Provincial Muslim Students Federation when Raja of Mahmudabad was President of the All India Muslim Students Federation. In 1944 he was appointed as a member of the Assam Muslim League Working Committee by the President of the Assam Provincial Muslim League, Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani. He was later elected as the general secretary in 1946 at the age of 26.  The Line System and Civil Disobedience Movement  The Government of India Act, 1935 made provisions for a Legislative Assembly in each province in British India; and elections for the Assam Legislative Assembly were held in 1937. Sir Syed Muhammed Saadullah was elected to the assembly and in the same year joined the All India Muslim League on Jinnah's request. Saadullah led a coalition government three times between 1 April 1937 and 11 February 1946. He supported Assam's inclusion within the new state of Pakistan and opposed the Line System which restricted Muslim immigrants to certain areas of Assam. The System originated in the district of Nowgong in 1920 and the lines were drawn with no fixed principles in determining them. Immigrant opposition grew and became a powerful force under Bhashani. On 15 September 1937, Mahmud Ali's uncle, Munawwar Ali moved a resolution in the Legislative Assembly calling for the abolition of the Line System. He argued that Bengali immigrants had brought \\"prosperity ... and wealth to the province of Assam\\". The motion was supported by Abdul Matin Choudhury. Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani adopted an uncompromising attitude and the resolution of the Working Committee of the Assam Provincial Muslim League held on 15 December 1944, called upon the government to abolish \\"the illegal and pernicious Line System\\" and immediately provide land to landless Bengali immigrants. On 11 February 1946 a Congress Ministry was formed with Bardoloi as Premier. He proceeded to deal with the immigrants by eviction under the Resolution of 13 July 1945 which was passed under Saadullah's regime. Bhashani strongly opposed the eviction and advised the landless and evicted to 'spread out'. The Assam Provincial Muslim League also decided to challenge the legality of the Line System in Court. As General Secretary of the Provincial League, Mahmud Ali stated, \\"The Muslim League is prepared for all eventualities and shall not retrace an inch from the chosen path. They are determined to disregard any laws which are not based on moral force\\". The Working Committee of the Provincial League met on 17 and 18 November 1946 and proposed to submit the issue to the arbitration of Liaquat and Nehru. The proposal was rejected by the Premier Bardoloi and eviction operations continued. Towards the end of December 1946, Bhashani, along with Mahmud Ali chalked out a programme of Civil Disobedience against the Assam Government's eviction policy and repression of Muslims. Ali sent a telegraphic message to the chairman, Committee of Action of the AIML seeking permission to launch the movement. However, the League High Command discouraged agitation. The Provincial League met at Sylhet on 9 February 1947 and it was decided that the movement would be non-communal and non-violent. Several conferences were held including a Joint Conference with the Bengal Provincial League. At a conference held at Goalpara, attended by over 75,000 people, it was decided to provide training for armed struggle and Muslim National Guards Training Centres were opened at various places. The place of the conference was named as Purba Pakistan Killa which served as a base for launching the agitational programme. At a meeting held on 9 March 1947 it was decided to launch the Civil Disobedience Movement without the approval of the League. Mahmud Ali in a leaflet ‚Äì \\"Struggle for Freedom Begins in Assam\\" invited the landless people of Bengal and Assam to occupy all waste lands in Assam and defy all laws of the Government. Bhashani and Ali were subsequently arrested and released after 3 June Plan had been declared.  Sylhet Referendum  According to 3 June Plan (Mountbatten Plan), agreed upon by League and Congress leaders, it was decided that the borders between the two new dominions to be carved out of British India would be determined by a boundary commission led by Sir Cyril Radcliffe. The Punjab and Bengal legislative assemblies decided in favour of partition and the Muslim-majority districts formed a part of the Dominion of Pakistan. In the Frontier Province and Sylhet a referendum was held to decide their fate. Ali and Bhashani were disappointed at the decision of a referendum not being held in the whole of Assam and Bhashani disassociated himself from the referendum in protest. However, after Ali's release from imprisonment he concentrated his efforts towards the Sylhet referendum and the people decided in favour of merging the district with the province of East Bengal. Ali expressed disappointment at the exclusion of two thanas from the district.  Pakistan (1947‚Äì1971) = Bengali Language Movement  During the Bengali Language Movement, Ali demanded the inclusion of Bengali, along with Urdu, as one of the national languages of Pakistan. He launched a weekly newspaper, the Nao Belal, to propagate the cause of the peasantry and working classes and to further the demand of Bengali as a state language. The movement was successful and Bengali was recognised as a state language by the second constituent assembly, and in the 1956 Constitution.  Ganatantri Dal  Disillusioned with the Muslim League government Ali left the party in 1952, and on 19 January 1953 founded Pakistan's first secular political party, the Ganatantri Dal. Haji Mohammad Danesh, a kisan leader, was its first president and Ali the secretary general. He later became president before forming a coalition with the United Front. The Ganatantri Dal was the first to open its doors to non- Muslims on an equal footing and demanded a secular constitution. The party manifesto included the demand for the abolition of feudalism without any compensation, the release of political prisoners, secession from the Commonwealth, nationalisation of jute trade, equal rights for women and minorities in social, political and economic spheres, and abolition of visa system between Pakistan and India. Ali spoke out against the League's pro-west stance and called for an independent foreign policy. As president, Mahmud Ali opposed the US-Pakistan Military Aid Pact signed on 19 April 1954 and on his party's appeal almost all political parties observed \\"Anti US-Pakistan Military Pact Day\\" Ali was elected the member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for constituency Sylhet-I in 1965 as a representative of the National Democratic Front. He lost the next election, in 1970, as a Pakistan Democratic Party candidate for the assembly.

The second five by two bay section was built in the early 1800s, which re-oriented the front entrance. A third four by two bay wing was added in the early 1900s. History The building was constructed by Admiral Hammond in the 1700s on land originally owned by Charles Carroll of Carrollton. The Hammond family served prominently in early Maryland government and settled several slave plantations through Anne Arundel and modern Howard County. Nearby Burleigh Manor was built by Col Rezin Hammond. The house is situated along Old Frederick road, the turnpike road between Baltimore and Frederick, Maryland. The property also bordered Centennial Lane, a road built in 1876 to connect Ellicott City to the Burleigh Manor property. An older single-story and a two- story slave building were situated on the site with a cupola barn. The Font Hill property also adjoins the historic Gray Rock slave plantation once managed by former County Executive Charles E. Miller. On 22 May 1879, William Matthew Merrick served as executor of J Monroe Mercer and Ella W Mercer, offering 92 acres and Font Hill for sale. The gas-lit property was described as adorned with forest trees, ornamental shrubbery and orchards. From 1926 to 1950, the manor was restored and named Abbottston by its owner Issac Cate. In 1957, the lands surrounding the manor totaled 285 acres. Owners sold the majority of the land to Font Hill Land Company. The manor property was reduced to 22.6 acres and the two oldest buildings and barn were demolished. The surrounding land was expanded and subdivided and developed by DeChiaro Enterprises, Inc. in 1962, The Stanlee, Inc. in 1965. By 1995, the Font Hill Property has been subdivided and reduced to 3.32 acres, with 36 modern homes built around the manor.

In particular, he has pinpointed the widespread corruption at the highest levels of government as the main cause of the problems that afflict Honduran society. Due to the increasing deterioration of the living conditions of the majority Hondurans as a result of the perceived indifference and/or incompetence of traditional politicians, Nasralla and other members of the civil society decided to establish a new political party.

The other two types of CCD are guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency and L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency. Clinical presentation of CTD is similar to that of GAMT and AGAT deficiency. CTD was first identified in 2001 with the presence of a hemizygous nonsense change in SLC6A8 in a male patient.  Signs and symptoms  Generally, the majority of individuals with creatine transporter defect express the following symptoms with varying levels of severity: developmental delay and regression, mental retardation, and abnormalities in expressive and cognitive speech. However, several studies have shown a wider variety of symptoms including, but not limited to attention deficit and hyperactivity with impulsivity, myopathy, hypotonia, semantic-pragmatic language disorder, oral dyspraxia, extrapyramidal movement disorder, constipation, absent speech development, seizures, and epilepsy. Furthermore, symptoms can significantly vary between hemizygous males and heterozygous females, although, symptoms are generally more severe in hemizygous males. Hemizygous males more commonly express seizures, growth deficiency, severe mental retardation, and severe expressive language impairment. Heterozygous females more commonly express mild intellectual disability, impairments to confrontational naming and verbal memory, and learning and behavior problems. Genetics CTD is caused by pathogenic variants in SLC6A8, located at Xq28. SLC6A8 contains 13 exons and spreads across 8.5 kb of genomic DNA (gDNA). The presence of hemizygous variants in males and heterozygous variants in females in SLC6A8 provides evidence that CTD is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This usually results in hemizygous males having severe symptoms, while heterozygous female carriers tend to have less severe and more varying symptoms.  Mechanism  The creatine phosphate system is needed for the storage and transmission of phosphate-bound energy in the brain and muscle. The brain and muscle have particularly high metabolic demands, therefore, making creatine a necessary molecule in ATP homeostasis. In regard to the brain, in order for creatine to reach the brain, it must first pass through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB). The BBB separates blood from brain interstitial fluid and is, therefore, able to regulate the transfer of nutrients to the brain from the blood. In order to pass through the BBB, creatine utilizes creatine transporter (CRT). When present at the BBB, CRT mediates the passage of creatine from the blood to the brain. When being transported from the blood to the brain, creatine has to constantly move against the creatine concentration gradient that is present at the border between the brain and circulating blood.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of CTD is usually suspected based on the clinical presentation of intellectual disability, abnormalities in cognitive and expressive speech, and developmental delay. Furthermore, a family history of X-linked intellectual disability, developmental coordination disorder, and seizures is strongly suggestive. Initial screening of CTD involves obtaining a urine sample and measuring the ratio of creatine to creatinine. If the ratio of creatine to creatinine is greater than 1.5, then the presence of CTD is highly likely. This is because a large ratio indicates a high amount of creatine in the urine. This, in turn, indicates inadequate transport of creatine into the brain and muscle. However, the urine screening test often fails in diagnosing heterozygous females. Studies have demonstrated that as a group heterozygous females have significantly decreased cerebral creatine concentration, but that individual heterozygous females often have normal creatine concentrations found in their urine. Therefore, urine screening tests are unreliable as a standard test for diagnosing CTD, particularly in females. A more reliable and sophisticated manner of testing for cerebral creatine concentrations is through in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). In vivo 1H MRS uses proton signals to determine the concentration of specific metabolites. This method of testing is more reliable because it provides a fairly accurate measurement of the amount of creatine inside the brain. Similar to urine testing, a drawback of using 1H MRS as a test for CTD is that the results of the test could be attributed to any of the cerebral creatine deficiencies. The most accurate and reliable method of testing for CTD is through DNA sequence analysis of SLC6A8. DNA analysis of SLC6A8 allows the identification of the location and type of variant causing the cerebral creatine deficiency. Furthermore, DNA analysis of SLC6A8 is able to prove that a cerebral creatine deficiency is due to CTD and not GAMT or AGAT deficiency. Treatment CTD is difficult to treat because the actual transporter responsible for transporting creatine to the brain and muscles is defective. Affected individuals have sufficient amounts of creatine, however it cannot get to the tissues where it is needed. Studies in which oral creatine monohydrate supplements were given to patients with CTD found that patients did not respond to treatment. However, similar studies conducted in which patients that had GAMT or AGAT deficiency were given oral creatine monohydrate supplements found that patient‚Äôs clinical symptoms improved. Patients with CTD are unresponsive to oral creatine monohydrate supplements because regardless of the amount of creatine they ingest, the creatine transporter is still defective, and therefore creatine is incapable of being transported across the BBB. Given the major role that the BBB has in the transport of creatine to the brain and unresponsiveness of oral creatine monohydrate supplements in CTD patients, future research will focus on working with the BBB to deliver creatine supplements. However, given the limited number of patients that have been identified with CTD, future treatment strategies must be more effective and efficient when recognizing individuals with CTD.

The Arch of Augustus (in French Arc d'Auguste) is a monument in the city of Aosta, northern Italy. It was erected in 25 BC on the occasion of the Roman victory over the Salassi and was the work of Aulus Terentius Varro Murena. It is located at the end of the decumanus maximus, a little distance from the Bourg Saint-Ours (quarter of the Collegiate Church of Saint Ursus) and from the eastern entrance of the city wall (the Porta Pr√¶toria). Description Constructed from conglomerate, the arch has a single vault, with a height to the keystone of 11.4 metres. Its span is a barrel vault, constituting an extension in width of a round arch. In the monument, various styles can be recognised: The ten engaged columns which decorate its facade and its sides culminate in Corinthian capitals, while the entablature, adorned with metopes and triglyphs, is of the Doric order. In the Medieval period, it came to be called the Saint-Vo√ªt (French for \\"Holy Arch\\") from an image of Jesus which was located in the same place. During the 12th century, the arch contained the home of a local noble family and in 1318 a small fortification was built inside it, designed for a corps of crossbowmen. In 1716, because of the numerous leaks that were compromising the integrity of the monument, the attic that previously crowned the arch was replaced with a slate roof. The arch's modern appearance is the result of a final intervention for restoration and consolidation which occurred in 1912 under the direction of Ernesto Schiaparelli.P.

It was built from 1831 to 1848 by Major Archibald Clunes Innes. It is also known as Lake Innes House ruins and environs. The property is owned by Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The ruins are 11 kilometres south of Port Macquarie, Australia. They are the relics of the house and stables once belonging to Major Archibold Clunes Innes, a retired officer of the British military. The ruins also include the remains of servants' cottages, an estate- workers' village, a farm that supplied the house with food, a brickmaking site and a boathouse by the lake. The site contains a rich history about the settlement of New South Wales, convict labour and the culture of the 1800s. It is managed by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and is accessible to the public. History=Major Archibald Clunes Innes Major Archibald Innes circa 1825. A silhouette of Major Innes by W.H. Fernyhough, 1836. Archibald Clunes Innes was born in 1800 at Thrumster, Scotland, the sixth son of Major James Innes. He was commissioned an ensign in the 3rd Regiment (the Buffs) in 1813 at age 13 and served in the Peninsular War. He came to Sydney as captain of the guard in the convict ship Eliza in 1822. Between January 1824 and May 1825 he served in Tasmania where he was commended for recapturing escaped convicts. In December 1825 he was appointed aide-de-camp to the lieutenant-governor of New South Wales and became a magistrate in November 1826. After this he became commandant of the penal settlement at Port Macquarie. In 1828 he resigned his commission and was appointed superintendent of police and magistrate at Parramatta. He served here until his resignation in 1829. In the same year he married Margaret, daughter of the Colonial Secretary, Alexander McLeay. In 1830 the couple came to Port Macquarie and Archibald was granted 2568 acres and was awarded contracts to supply the surrounding convict population with food. At this time Port Macquarie was a major convict settlement. Archibald gradually built his property over the next decade adding sections to his original modest house. By 1840 it consisted of 22 rooms and was known as one of the most luxurious houses in the area. Unlike most houses of this time it had an underground cistern, a bathroom, privies and a boiler for providing hot water. During the 1830s and 1840s, Lake Innes House was an important social centre in which Major Innes provided generous hospitality to a succession of prominent house guests who in 1847 included even Sir Charles Fitzroy, at that time the Governor of NSW and his wife Mary. As his wealth grew he acquired more and more property. He bought sheep and cattle stations all over northern New South Wales, among them Yarrows on the Hastings, Brimbine and Innestown on the Manning, Waterloo, Innes Creek, Kentucky and Beardy Plains. He also bought Furracabad. The township on this station which is the present Glen Innes, was named after him. In his first few years at Lake Innes he produced the first sugar grown in the district and in 1844 he planted thirty acres of vines. Major Innes was convinced that Port Macquarie would become a major port and settlement area. However, the entrance to the Hastings was too dangerous to encourage a large amount of shipping and the road that was built up to the Tablelands was found too hazardous. It was this miscalculation and the general economic depression of the 1840s which lead to his financial ruin. In addition the transportation of convicts to NSW ceased and the Port Macquarie Penal Settlement closed. This deprived him of his contracts to feed the convict population and meant that he no longer had the use of convict cheap labour to run his property. In 1853 he abandoned Lake Innes House and accepted employment as assistant gold commissioner and magistrate at Nundle and later police magistrate at Newcastle, where he died on 29 August 1857. The Grandeur of Lake Innes House Annabella Boswell (n√©e Innes) circa 1840 A sketch of the layout of Lake Innes House by Annabella Boswell circa 1845. Descriptions of the house when it was a luxurious residence are contained in two diaries of young women who lived there. The most famous diary is by Annabella Boswell, Major Innes's niece, who was there between 1843 and 1848. The other diary is by Louisa Isabella Parker who received some of her education at the house. She lived there periodically between 1848 and 1853. Annabella said that the house consisted of twenty-two rooms which were all well furnished. In addition, there was a separate building called the bachelor's hall which consisted of a sitting room and three bedrooms. She had drawn a plan of the house which is shown on the right and gave the following description of its overall layout. ‚ÄúI have by me a rough plan of the house and grounds, stables and outbuildings, which gives some idea of their size and extent. There was a wide double verandah to the front of the house, which faced the Lake and the setting sun. A verandah extended along the whole of the south side. The drawing-room was a large square room at the corner 10ft by 24 ft, with two French Windows to the west and two to the south opening on to the verandah.\\" St Thomas' Church, Port Macquarie circa 1840. The drawing room as described by Louisa Parker. Lake Innes House before the fire. A watercolour of Lake Innes House, circa 1840. A more detailed account of the house was given by Louisa Parker (n√©e McIntyre) who recalled her first sight of the house when she was a child. ‚ÄúI can vividly recall my first visit to Lake Innes. At the invitation of the Major and his wife, I accompanied Mrs. and the Misses Innes home in their carriage one Sunday after morning service in St. Thomas' Church (see painting of a gathering at St Thomas‚Äô Church at about the time described by Louisa on the left). The carriage was drawn by four horses, and a coachman was in charge. Three or four gentlemen visitors rode behind the carriage. After an exceedingly pleasant drive, we passed through a white double gate, which gave entrance to the outer enclosure of the estate. About a mile from the house was another double white gate, and the drive then ran between well- kept hedges of lantana. On approaching the end of this avenue, I got my first glimpse, of the observatory towering among Norfolk Island pines and gigantic bamboos. The latter were waving and creaking above the gate at which we had just arrived. The gentlemen then dismounted and handed us out of the carriage, and we passed along a broad, winding walk, bordered with ornamental shrubs and monthly roses, through which glimpses of the lake were to be seen. Beds of various shapes and sizes, well filled with flowers, and well-kept walks met the gaze, and a very pretty latticed summer-house attracted my notice. On reaching the house, we passed under an outer verandah, and went up a few steps, and were on the upper verandah, which was flagged with square blocks of stone. A gentleman rang the doorbell, and a liveried butler appeared, and we entered a fine, spacious hall, hung with pictures of a sporting character. To the left of the hall was the library, which was well filled with Volumes of all sizes. This room was the general resort. On the opposite side was the dining room, wherein was a table which, judging by its length, bespoke great hospitality. Suspended above it from the ceiling were three large cut-glass chandeliers, which had a very pretty effect. The walls were hung with pictures, depicting mostly historic scenes, and were enclosed in massive gilt frames. Very noticeable among the pictures was one of the Major in uniform, and he was depicted as a handsome man, and was accredited as being such in his youthful days. There were large pier glasses at each end of the room, and folds of rich-looking tapestry fell over the doors. I remember also seeing statuettes in bronze of Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington. Leaving the dining room, a passage was entered, and at the north end of this was a sitting room, and at the south end was the drawing-room, which was furnished in the rich and elaborate style of the period, the chairs and settees being covered. with gold-figured satin. It was a large room, and was decorated with rich tapestry, while large pictures in gilt frames hung from the walls. I cannot properly convey an idea of the beauty of that room, and it must suffice to say that it contained the best that the decorative art of the day could suggest. There was a long corridor to the east of the drawing-room, and on each side of it were sleeping apartments, the first to the left being Mrs. Innes' bedroom and dressing-room. Opposite was another fine bed and dressing- room, which were occupied by the Governor and his wife (Sir Charles and Lady Mary Fitzroy) during their visit. Then came the 'French room,' furnished after the fashion which the name implies. I remember that the curtains seemed to fall over the bed from the ceiling. Then followed other bedrooms, one of which was called the 'green room,' and was occupied by Colonel Grey or Captain Geary on their visits. At the end of the corridor was the bath-room, to which the water was laid on. A few yards from the bath-room was a flight of steps, leading to four other rooms, occupied at an earlier day by the governess and her young charges. These apartments included the school- room, governess's room, and a play- room. Ascending a flight of steps from these rooms, the observatory was reached, from which a fine view of the lake and the surrounding country was to be had. From the east end of the passage a door led into the courtyard, which was bricked, and in which the kitchen (a two-storied building) stood at the back of the house. Above the kitchen were the butler's apartments. Numerous other buildings filled the ground at the back of the residence. In the second entrance from the court yard stood a building of Gothic design, with a large clock over the entrance which proclaimed the hours. To this apartment the bachelors resorted in order to smoke, and for this reason it earned the name of 'bachelors' hall.' The homestead formed quite a village, with the abodes of the employees, carriage houses, stables, etc. The orchard contained an abundance of fruit, and a vineyard supplied grapes from which wine for the table was made. Visitors were constantly coming and going.‚Äù The Piper of Lake Innes House The full dress of a Scottish piper in 1840. Annabella often referred to Bruce the piper who entertained the residents of the house. In one part of her diary she says that ‚ÄúBruce played some pibrochs early for Mr Macleay‚Äôs benefit. I had no idea the bagpipes could sound so beautiful, though I liked them at all times the sound is so different in the open air when the piper is walking up and down.\\" The piper that she referred to was Peter Bruce who came as a free settler from Scotland in about 1840. He was part of a family whose members were renowned for their ability to play the bagpipes and are mentioned in the texts on the history of piping. His father was Alexander Bruce (1771-1840) of Glenelg, Scotland who had been taught by the famous MacCrimmon pipers and his uncle John Bruce (1775-1847) was the piper to Sir Walter Scott. It is also mentioned in the texts that two of Alexander's sons Peter and John, who also played the bagpipes very well, immigrated to Australia. Although Peter played the pipes to entertain the guests he was also employed as a servant. Annabella mentions that he assists the butler serve at the table when required. However, his main occupation seems to be a farmer as she says that ‚Äúin the fields grew oats and lucerne for hay also maize and Indian corn, Bruce having the charge or oversight of all.\\" At the time that Annabella wrote her diary in 1844 Peter Bruce was about to marry, Helen, her cousins maid. She mentions that the wedding of Bruce and Helen was held in the drawing-room The bride was Helen Sanderson,NSW Marriage Certificate V18442056 76/1844 a Scottish girl, who immigrated to Australia in about 1838. She was on board the same ship that Annabella's maid Christina Ross had taken to come to Australia. The couple had several children while they lived at Lake Innes and in the early 1850s they moved to the goldfields at Bathurst and then to Beechworth. Eventually they came to Benalla in Victoria where Peter bought some land and became a farmer. He continued playing the bagpipes and his obituary mentions that he was known ‚Äúas one of the best pipers in the colony.‚Äù Convicts of Lake Innes James and Martha Lahey. He was the butler in the early 1840s. The vast majority of the servants at Lake Innes house were convicts. Even the two butlers that were mentioned in the girls‚Äô diaries were both convicts. Annabella mentions that the name of the butler while she was there was Lahey. She also mentioned that his wife was the ladies maid to her aunt Margaret Innes. The butler that she refers to was James Lahey, an Irishman who came to Australia in 1838 on the convict ship Patriot. He had been a soldier in the 41st Regiment in India until he was convicted of attempting to stab the adjutant.NSW Convict Indents 1838. At the time of his conviction, he had been married to Martha Eaton for almost ten years and she followed him to New South Wales after his transportation. James was assigned to Major Innes and served as his butler for several years. After he obtained his pardon he continued to work for Innes for some time as a hotelier in WauchopeFamily history sources. and then became a grazier. The other butler mentioned in the diaries was George Wilson. Louisa Parker describes him as a tall Scotsman who was a former soldier who served at Waterloo. She said he wore a butler's uniform and waited at the table always being attentive and considerate.Mrs Henry Parker, ‚ÄúEarly days at Lake Innes, Port Macquarie‚Äù [manuscript at Australian National Library MS 3229], p. 14. George Wilson was a convict who was transported to Australia for forgery in 1838 on the ship Lord Lyndoch. At the time of his conviction he was 43 years old. His occupation on the indent is stated to be soldier and indoor servant. He was sent to Port Macquarie Penal Settlement and obtained his Ticket Of Leave there in 1847. It may have been from this time that he went to work at Lake Innes. When the Innes family went to Newcastle in 1853 Louisa Parker mentions that George went with them. It appears that he continued to work for the family until he became quite old. Thomas Wilson (not a relative) mentioned in 1867 in his diary that ‚Äúold George‚Äù who was butler to Major Innes called at his house. He died at Port Macquarie in 1876.NSW Death Certificate V18761011 44B Another servant mentioned several times by Annabella in her diary was Mrs Halloran who was the wife of a convict servant at Lake Innes. She said: > At the poultry yard were two cottages built on a piece of rising ground > worked in the fields, the other for the Hallorans. There were pig-sties and > sheds for the poultry, but I must own both pigs and fowls enjoyed a good > deal of freedom. Halloran was a quiet elderly Irishman. I don‚Äôt quite know > how his wife found her way to the colony but there she was and she was a > decent, industrious creature, more than content to find herself so > comfortably provided for, and quite happy among pigs and fowls, or as she > herself called them, ‚ÄúThe pigs and the rest of the poultry.\\" James Halloran was an Irish convict who had been convicted in Ballinrobe, County Mayo in 1839 of stealing timber. He was transported on the ship Middlesex and arrived in Sydney in 1840. It mentions on this record that there was a petition on behalf of ‚Äúhis destitute wife and family praying that she may be permitted to join her husband with her children.\\" The Hallorans had a son at Lake Innes in 1842.NSW Births Deaths and Marriages V18421982 26A/1842 James obtained his pardon in 1846 and it seems that sometime after this the family moved to Sydney. Not all of the convicts employed at Lake Innes were as agreeable and well behaved as these. Richard Young was a former soldier who had been convicted of desertion in County Mayo in 1834. He was transported to Sydney on the ship Forth in 1835. In 1837 he was assigned to Major Innes and two years later he absconded and became a notorious bushranger sometimes called ‚ÄúGentleman Dick‚Äù. Residents after the Innes family Gustavus Innes, who inherited the house after the death of Major Innes. He rented the house to several people. After Archibald Innes died in 1857 his son Gustavus Innes inherited the property. He became a clergyman and so did not live at the house. His mother Margaret and sister Eliza lived there for two years. His mother died in 1858 and his sister married in 1859. The first tenant was Dr. Frederick McKellar who lived there from 1860 until his death in 1863. He was followed by Thomas George Wilson who rented the house from 1863 until about 1867. He did some farming there but it was not a success and he moved to a property called Clifton at Port Macquarie. After this, Dr. John Cash Nield rented the property. He had been appointed as surgeon to the Port Macquarie Asylum for the Infirm and Destitute. In 1868 it is mentioned that he had purchased machinery for the property at Lake Innes. and for some time he grew sugar which seemed to be quite successful. The to let advertisement inserted in the newspaper by Gustavus Innes. It appeared in 1860. In 1871 Gustavus Innes sold the farm to Henry Zions. Henry was a tailor in Sydney and therefore did not live at the property. It appears that he rented the estate to the Rev. Charles Campbell Kemp who had moved to the area after the death of his wife. Kemp planted more grape vines on the estate. There is a detailed description of the estate at this time by Kemp's son Beilby Kemp who seems to have written a book called Friday Three Thirteen.Friday Three Thirteen was published in 1914. Although there is no author for this book it appears that it was written by Kemp‚Äôs son Beilby Portens Pell Kemp who was born in 1853 and whose life was fairly similar to the one described in this book. A chapter in the book entitled ‚ÄúA Gem of the Southern Hemisphere‚Äù describes his stay at the lake in about 1872. At this time the house was still very habitable although somewhat overgrown by plants. Rev Kemp died in 1874 and after this, the house fell into disrepair and gradually became derelict over the next 20 years. In 1896 there was a major fire in the house and it was burnt to the ground. The newspaper gave the following account. > News has been brought into Port Macquarie that late on Saturday the old > residence on the Lake Innes Estate, built by Major Innes (convict labour) > was burnt to the ground. The police are endeavouring to find out the cause > of the fire, but have not yet succeeded. The building was erected soon after > Port Macquarie was formed a convict settlement. It has not been inhabited > for over twenty-five years, and was little better than a ruin at the time of > the fire. The property was owned by Mr. Zions of Sydney. By 1908 the property was owned by Captain Philip Charley who decided to make it a horse stud. This venture appears to have been relatively successful and when he died in 1937 his children inherited the Estate. One of the sons Noel Charley built a timber mill just outside the boundary but drew the timber from the hardwood trees on the property. Today the property is under the protection of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and is open to the public.  Description  Lake Innes House and associated sites are located on and adjacent to a south-pointing peninsula of land between Lake Innes and Innes Swamp. The main site is 11 kilometres south of the town of Port Macquarie, the house being well-sited on rising ground. The vegetation of the area consists of sclerophyll forest on the drier ground, with tea-tree and casuarina on the swamps and reed beds around the lake margins. In the heyday of Lake Innes House it appears that its immediate area consisted of gardens and cleared land, with an attractive view across the lake towards Mount Seaview in the distance. Diaries of the Innes' niece Annabella Boswell (n√©e Innes) between 1843-8 noted the existence of a vineyard and a \\"new flower garden\\" with hollyhocks, used for an 1843 birthday celebration dinner table decoration. Very little above-ground evidence of Lake Innes House's once renowned garden appears on site today although layout, paths, etc., may well survive below the ground surface and its cover. Close to the house to one side are two enormous clumps of giant bamboo (Bambusa balcooa), a common feature of gardens of this ambition and scale at the time, certainly amongst notables such as the Macarthur family, Governors etc. ;House: The ruins of the house and stables constitute the major physical evidence of the Innes property, although a number of other related sites are known to exist or are suspected to exist in the area. These include the remains and sites of servants' cottages, an estate-workers' village, a farm that supplied the house with food, a brickmaking site, a corduroy road towards the beach, another corduroy road to the lake, a boathouse by the lake and probably other sites yet to be located. The two main wings of the house form an L-shaped structure, the living rooms facing west with views over the lake and the bedroom wing facing south to avoid the heat of the sun. Adjacent to the courtyard behind were the kitchen, accommodation for male visitors (the bachelors hall), servants quarters, laundry store, wine cellar, dairy and the underground cistern that provided the household water supply. At the eastern end of the bedroom wing were a bathroom, privies and a boiler for providing hot water in the bathroom. The surviving standing remains comprise but a small part of what was once a 22-room mansion and its associated buildings. ;Outbuildings: Adjoining the house to the north east and connected to it by a common wall with the servants' quarters and associated facilities is the stables complex. In addition to stabling for a number of horses and accommodation for carriages and storage for harness, this complex contained living spaces for stable workers. The structure is in a better state of preservation than the house with many of the walls still standing to the roof level. Boswell's diaries include note of a separate schoolroom in which the Innes children were educated. Both house and stables are made of handmade sandstock bricks and similar brick was also used at most of the related sites. Brick sizes are fairly uniform but probably varied a little depending on the mud in use and the irregular finish. Most probably the bricks were manufactures on the property from clay which came from a source not far from the house, on the eastern side of the road from Port Macquarie. (The Archaeology of Lake Innes House, National Parks and Wildlife Service) The construction of the house and stables would have used large quantities of various types of wood: for roof framing, shingles, flooring, skirting boards, fireplace-surrounds, window and door frames, the window and doors themselves, verandas, stairs and so on, but very little has survived on the site. The physical condition of the ruins was reported as poor as at 16 April 1998, while the archaeological potential was reported as high. While the structural integrity of Lake Innes Estate and associated sites is medium to low the archeological integrity of the entire site is high. Due to the limited development of the Innes peninsula following the death of Archibald Innes, there is still clear visible evidence of the main house and stables and other associated sites which supported the function of the main household. Evidence of brick manufacture, food production and servants' accommodation are all evident on the site. Apart from some illegal digging by fossickers and past researchers on the site, the archeological resource is substantially intact in many areas as demonstrated by the first excavations in 1999.  Heritage listing  Lake Innes House ruins and environs is a major historical monument to the pre-1850 period of settlement of Australia. Its key role in the early development of a region in NSW is made poignant by the evocative ruined remains of a surprisingly large establishment and the existence of detailed contemporary records (Boswell) of day-to-day activities during its decline. It contains an extensive archaeological resource for the study of Australian architecture, gardening, farming history and early 19th-century domestic arrangements. In the above respects it is a rare resource because of subsequent inactivity and the existence of contemporary records (journals, drawing and plan). The house ruins are one of a small number of large colonial period domestic ruins in NSW. In its growth and planning it testifies to the confidence and aspirations of those who became quickly rich on Government resources during the 1830s and in its swift decline and ruin it symbolises the sudden demise of this class as a result of the 1840s economic recession (Clive Lucas & Partners, 1987) Lake Innes Estate is of state cultural significance for its natural and cultural values. The place is of significance for its remnant wetland areas, koala population and other threatened animal species. The place also contains rare cultural evidence relating to the layout and functioning of a large seaside estate including largely archaeologically intact outbuildings, industrial areas (brick-making sites and roads), convict, servant guest and resident accommodation. The combination of written and physical evidence related to Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal occupation of the site make the Lake Innes Estate an outstanding research resource. Historically the association of the place with prominent colonials such as Innes, the Macleays and Boswell is an important element of the significance of the place. Lake Innes Estate is significant to the local and regional community as demonstrated through community action beginning in the 1940s and 1950s and continuing through to the public participation and interest in the ongoing conservation programmes at the site. Lake Innes Estate is also of significance for its interpretive and educational potential. The Estate is capable of demonstrating a number of local and state historic themes. The major themes relate to Aboriginal occupation, history and land tenure; the local environment and the impact of human settlement; convictism and the rise of the middle classes in nineteenth century Australia; expansion and exploration at the edge of European settlement through commerce, pastoralism and agriculture; and the development of townships such as Port Macquarie in the north coast region of NSW.NSW Parks and Wildlife Service 2000 Lake Innes House ruins and environs was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It is directly associated with Major Archibald Innes who was a prominent entrepreneur in NSW during the 1830s and 1840s and the owner of a very large pastorally based empire. He exemplified a class of colonial capitalists and speculators dominant in NSW in the period 1820‚Äì1845. The place contains physical evidence of the focus for the history of the land settlement of the New England region.Clive Lucas & Partners 1987 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Major Archibald Innes (1800-1857) was a key figure in the development of Port Macquarie and the New England area. He was one of the largest and wealthiest landholders in NSW comparable to John Jamieson, Henry Dangar, Richard Jones and William Lawson. Glen Innes in northern NSW was named after him. His push to make Port Macquarie the coastal link for the New England region is a key factor in understanding the settlement of this region. Margaret Innes, one of the daughters of Alexander Macleay, is likely to have had a strong influence on the development and layout of the garden house at the Lake Innes estate reflecting her personal and family interests in scientific pursuits. The establishment of the Lake Innes Estate represents the rise of the landed upper and middle classes in NSW towards the end of the period of convict transportation. The basis of Innes' wealth and the construction of his was dependent upon convict labour. Innes' convict labour supplied goods for the Port Macquarie penal settlement. The end of transportation played a major role in the decline of Lake Innes House and Major Innes' financial enterprises. In the context of land settlement, the Lake Innes Estate is historically rare in a regional and state context as an example of an 1840s estate with the full range of estate functions still visible in the landscape. The lake Innes Estate is representative of the impact of the end of convict transportation on individuals as well as the colony as a whole. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The stables are an unusually substantial and architectural courtyard stable complex and although ruined are of a rare scale and unique formal design for such colonial buildings in Australia outside Tasmania. The place is one of only a few seaside estates built in NSW in the colonial period and demonstrates contemporary attitudes to landscape design and estate planning shown in the siting of buildings, location of roads and the construction of a lookout tower. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has been a historical site in the minds of people of the Port Macquarie area and others interested in Australian history for the past 100 years. The immediacy of its historical, evocative and romantic appeal has for many years added to its reputation as an historic site. The Birpai Local Aboriginal Land council have a strong interest in the management of the Lake Innes Peninsula in particular in the location and management of Aboriginal sites. Sights along lighthouse beach have been assessed as having very high significance to the local Aboriginal people. Regional visitation to the site as interesting ruins commenced as early as 1900 and visitation has occurred ever since The popularity of NPWS guided tours indicate that there is a strong level of local interest in the site. The Port Macquarie Historical Society has maintained a strong interest in the site since at least the 1950s and holds a number of key items and documents associated with the site including Boswell's diary and a dress belonging to her. The Society has also demonstrated its interests in the site through publications. Press coverage of the NPWS conservation works and UNE archaeological works over the last decade has demonstrated, and helped to maintain, public interest in the site. Professor Graham Connah's Lake Innes investigations have employed many students and ex-student volunteers since 1993. The site has formed an important part of their training and the archaeology programme has generated community interest and support. Connah has raised substantial funding for the current research programme indicating a broad interest in his research into the site. Hastings City Council see Major Innes as a potential focus for cultural tourism in Port Macquarie. Major Innes, and sites associated with him, are considered to be of the highest importance in the local community. Motels, roads and other features in the municipality are named after him. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The place is a unique resource for the study of Australian architecture, gardening, farming history and early 19th century domestic arrangements. The place contains roads which are good examples of convict built civil engineering works to survive unaltered in NSW. The house has the rare remains of an early attached bathroom and boiler room which had hot and cold water services and possibly a sewage system. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The house ruins are one of a small number of large colonial period domestic ruins in NSW. It is a rare resource because of the existence of contemporary records (journals, drawing and plan). The Lake Innes Peninsula has natural landscape values of state significance. These include the existence of a viable and healthy koala population and koala habitat as well as a number of other animal species listed under the threatened Species Act. Much of the wetland area is protected under State Environmental Planning Policy 14 (SEPP 14:P Wetlands) and is one of the few major coastal wetlands in NSW not affected by flood mitigation drainage schemes. The natural and cultural scientific and research potential of the Lake Innes Estate is rare in a state context. The extent and integrity of the archaeological remains, including standing archeological remains are rare and provide a unique research opportunity in NSW.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Hawaii voters chose 4 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Hawaii was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Hawaii weighed in for this election as 7% more Democratic than the national average. As a result of Reagan's victory in Hawaii, he became the second Republican presidential candidate to win Hawaii as well as the first since Richard Nixon in 1972. To date, it is the last time Hawaii has voted for a Republican in a presidential election, making Hawaii one of six states Reagan was the last Republican to win; the others being Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Hawaii, with just under 99% of the electorate voting for either the Democratic or Republican parties. All four island districts in Hawaii voted in majority for President Reagan, a stand-alone event in the State's history. , this is the last election in which any of Hawaii's counties voted for the Republican candidate. Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice- President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970's, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. Some of these new policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Hawaii with a decisive 11 point landslide. The election results in Hawaii are reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the American Pacific states at large, as Reagan did. This is also the most recent election cycle where Hawaii sent Republican electors to the Electoral College. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this claim to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Hawaii, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Hawaii and elsewhere.

The mall is located along Interstate 5 at its interchange with State Route 539 (Guide Meridian Road) north of downtown Bellingham. History Bellis Fair opened in August 1988, at the site of a former USDA Soil Conservation Service plant-materials center. The mall attracted several retailers from downtown Bellingham, including Sears, Cineplex Odeon, JCPenney and The Bon March√©, who had failed to build a mall in downtown Bellingham in the early 1980s. Mervyn's and Target also anchored the mall initially, with the latter as part of the first wave of Target stores in the Pacific Northwest. The mall was popular with shoppers from nearby Vancouver, Canada in the early 1990s, but sales waned as the Canadian dollar declined in value against the American dollar by 1995. In 1990, a Nordstrom Place Two store was added, having also relocated from downtown Bellingham. The Nordstrom Place Two store was later converted to Nordstrom Rack in 1994, before closing in 1999 and becoming an auxiliary store for The Bon March√©. Also in 1999, Old Navy was added.

A Fascist sympathizer, she was described as '..a middle aged woman, with a shrill voice, and a clamorous, demanding manner, who chatted like a magpie and lost her temper with ease.'Gates, E. M. (1982). End of the affair: the collapse of the Anglo-French Alliance 1939-40. 409-412\\\\. Allen & Unwin. Charles de Gaulle called her 'a turkey', while Winston Churchill nicknamed her 'the parrot'.Pelayo, D. (2009) L'accident de Paul Reynaud. l'Agglorieuse Life H√©l√®ne de Portes was born H√©l√®ne Rebuffel in 1902, the daughter of Charles Rebuffel, an engineer and director of Soci√©t√© des Grands Travaux de Marseille from 1917 to 1939. She married Count Henri de Portes, but they separated after she had borne him two children. She became Paul Reynaud's mistress in 1930, the year Reynaud entered the cabinet. Reynaud's premiership As Reynaud rose in the 1930s through the upper ranks of his party, the Democratic Republican Alliance, de Portes' status moved upwards with him. She was described by insiders as la porte √† c√¥t√©, the side door through which interested persons could gain access to the state of mind of the highest echelon of the French government. As the power of Nazi Germany grew, Reynaud was identified by many French voters and deputies as a strong voice of resistance to Germany. He became Minister of Finance in 1938 and on 21 March 1940, after the German occupation of Poland, became Prime Minister of France. As such, he led a government whose status depended on its alliance with the United Kingdom. However, while the French alliance with England was strategic policy from the standpoint of the fight against Hitler, the alliance was obnoxious to the Countess, who has been described as \\"so violently anti- British that Hitler had once sent an emissary to woo her favours.\\" Reynaud's ability to lead his government against the Axis was compromised by his partner, who was on terms of friendship with the ambassadors from Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany. Battle of France After the catastrophic Battle of Sedan, the French forces and the government were forced to fall back from Paris. On 10‚Äì13 June 1940, Reynaud tried to re-establish his government at Tours. To reorganize the forces, he opened intensive negotiations on 12 June with General Charles de Gaulle, but H√©l√®ne de Portes personally intervened in their discussion and threw a temper tantrum, in their presence, at the prospect of what she considered to be futile further warfare. De Portes had a particular antipathy towards Winston Churchill and, according to his bodyguard Walter Thompson, actually lunged at Churchill's throat with a knife she had concealed within her Christian Dior dress.Thompson, W. (1951). I was Churchill's shadow. C. Johnson, London. ASIN 0000C12EW Callan, P. (2012). 'Adolf Hitler's orders: Kill Winston Churchill'. Daily Express, 21 July 2012. Northern & Shell, London. As the French front continued to collapse, Reynaud, his government and his mistress briefly relocated at the Hotel Splendid, Bordeaux on 15 June. De Portes intensified her efforts to persuade her partner to offer terms of surrender, going to the length of intriguing with a key diplomat from the United States of America. The disgusted envoy later recalled that \\"I don't think her role in encouraging the defeatist elements during Reynaud's critical last days as prime minister should be underestimated. She spent an hour weeping in my office to get us to urge Reynaud to ask for an armistice.\\" H√©l√®ne de Portes' final intervention on 16 June was aimed at the last-ditch plan, strongly supported by Winston Churchill and Jean Monnet, to merge France and the United Kingdom into an emergency Franco-British Union. The document to create the Union was meant to be presented to the French Cabinet that evening as an alternative to requesting an armistice, but de Portes entered the stenographer's room where the document was being typed, read it, and then left to spread its contents among the Cabinet ministers who were leaning toward defeatism. Forewarned, the Cabinet rejected both the Union and Reynaud's government. The beaten premier resigned that evening. Death Now private citizens (de Portes' title of Countess, which she had assumed with her marriage, had no legal standing in the Third Republic), Reynaud and de Portes left Bordeaux, driving southeast, away from the advancing German armies, intending to stop at Reynaud's holiday home at Gr√®s, Herault, before fleeing to North Africa. On 28 June, with Reynaud at the wheel, their car inexplicably left the road and hit a plane tree at La Peyrade, between Frontignan and S√®te; de Portes was all but decapitated, while Reynaud escaped with relatively minor head injuries.Benoit-M√©chin, J. (1956). Soixante jours qui √©branl√®rent l'Occident : Volume 3, La Fin du r√©gime - 26 juin / 10 juillet 1940, p.46. Laffont, Paris. Hospitalized at Montpellier, Reynaud was arrested on his discharge and imprisoned for the rest of the war. At about the same time, French diplomat Dominique Leca was apprehended by police in Madrid while in possession of a diplomatic bag containing gold and jewellery destined for de Portes' children evacuated to the USA. The affair was used as propaganda by the Vichy government to further discredit the Third Republic. Epitaphs The British journalist Noel Barber characterized H√©l√®ne as follows: > The most powerful woman in France, she exercised a malign influence on the > destinies of her country. The American journalist and author Vincent Sheean added: > She was not chic, she was not charming, and she was not intelligent. Reynaud > was used to her, depended on her, needed her: that was all. Depictions H√©l√®ne de Portes is portrayed in Jean Marboeuf's 1993 film P√©tain by Fr√©d√©rique Tirmont.

Marshall left the paper in 1999 for a Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He moved to New York City shortly thereafter, where he continued his freelance journalism. Markets and democracy In his 2012 book The Surprising Design of Market Economies (Texas 2012)and related opinion pieces in The New York Times, Bloomberg View and other publications, Marshall asserts that government constructs markets in an economic sense. He says the \\"Free Market\\" is a false concept that impedes a more active discussion about what kind of markets government builds, which he says in a democracy should be part of regular public discussion. His book takes readers through the construction of property, corporations, patents and physical infrastructure, all of which Marshall views as the foundations for markets. The book and its ideas aroused opposition from those who view markets as existing outside government. On Sept 14, 2012, Nick Sorrentino, in his blog AgainstCronyCapitalism.org, described Marshall's ideas in a Bloomberg View essay the previous day as \\"nonsense.\\" \\"Markets are as natural as a dawn in the desert,\\" said Sorrentino. \\"And like all of these things they do not need government to exist.\\" Marshall's ideas have received support from other quarters. Challenge Magazine, a journal edited by Jeffrey Madrick and whose editorial board includes Paul Krugman and Robert Solow, had an article by Marshall summarizing the book's ideas in its March/April 2014 issue. Controversy over New Urbanism In the 1990s, Marshall became involved in controversy over his criticism of New Urbanism, a school of suburban design he called a marketing scheme to repackage conventional suburban sprawl behind nostalgic imagery and aspirational sloganism.See, e.g., Alex Marshall, \\"Building New Urbanism: Less Filling, But Not So Tasty\\", Builder Magazine, November 30, 1999, p. ___.

The song is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. Lyrically, it portrays the protagonist's \\"feigned nonchalance\\". It was well received by music critics, who praised Westerberg's songwriting talent. The song has been covered by other artists, notably Kindness in 2009 and Lorde in 2013. Composition \\"Swingin Party\\" was written by Paul Westerberg and produced by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of \\"Somethin' Stupid\\" (1967) by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra. The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's \\"feigned nonchalance\\". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is \\"literary reflections\\" as Westerberg sings, \\"Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'\\". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that \\"life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees\\", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is \\"about loneliness and youthful insecurity\\". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: \\"One of the reasons we used to drink so much is that it was scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening to put yourself on display all the time.\\" Critical reception \\"Swingin Party\\" received positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised Westerberg's songwriting credits for the track. PopMatters' Michael Keefe lauded Westerberg's songwriting ability on \\"Swingin Party\\". Craig Rosen writing for Billboard opined that the song showcased Westerberg's \\"capable\\" songwriting for the band. In a separate journal for the same publication, Braoley Bambarger named \\"Swingin Party\\" a \\"bittersweeet\\" ballad that \\"won the hearts of a generation of college radio fans\\". Craig Marks from Spin shared that the song's line \\"Bring your own lampshade/ Somewhere there's a party\\" is the third best lyric written by Westerberg for The Replacements. Tim Nelson from BBC Music selected \\"Swingin Party\\" as one of the outstanding tracks from Tim. Other versions New Zealand singer Lorde (pictured) covered \\"Swingin Party\\" in 2013.

Background The two men had previously fought each other on November 8, 2003. Jones, in his previous fight at heavyweight against John Ruiz on March 1, 2003, had weighed in at 193 pounds and was at 199 pounds on the night of the fight against Ruiz. In his following fight, which was Jones' first fight against Tarver, Jones was clearly weakened and slower in the ring after losing 24 pounds to get back down to the 175 pound light heavyweight limit, while Tarver, who had captured the WBC and IBF titles Jones had vacated after his WBA heavyweight title win against John Ruiz in March, was able to land several punching combinations through the course of his first fight against Jones and fought a closely contested fight. However, while one judge scored the bout a draw (114‚Äì114), the other two judges had Jones clearly ahead by scores of 117‚Äì111 and 116‚Äì112, giving Jones the win by majority decision. Following his victory, Jones initially talked about returning to the heavyweight division to take on Mike Tyson in what would be his final fight.Jones's Reputation Takes Hit In Lackluster Victory for Title, N.Y. Times article, 2003-11-10, Retrieved on 2013-11-17 The planned Jones‚ÄìTyson superfight never came into fruition and Jones eventually decided to meet Tarver in a rematch on May 15, 2004. The fight Jones got off to a good start and served as the aggressor of the first round using his trademark quickness to his advantage and easily won the first round of the fight on all three of the judge's scorecards. Jones attempted to repeat his success in the second round as Tarver held back, seemingly waiting for Jones to make a mistake. Just over midway through the round, Jones attempted to hit Tarver with a right hand, Tarver however countered with a quick left hook that dropped Jones to the canvas for only the second time in his professional career (Lou Del Valle scored a knockdown against Jones in 1998). Jones struggled to get back up but eventually made it back to his feet, however referee Jay Nady deemed Jones too hurt to continue and quickly ended the fight and Tarver was rewarded with the knockout victory. It was the second loss of Jones' professional career and the first time that he had been knocked out. Jones' previous loss had come via disqualification against Montell Griffin in 1997, a loss which was avenged by Jones with a first round knockout of Griffin in the rematch later that year. The manner of Jones' loss to Tarver was arguably the biggest surprise in boxing since James \\"Buster\\" Douglas had knocked out Mike Tyson on February 11, 1990 as a 42/1 outsider. Jones' loss ended his near decade reign at the top in boxing's pound for pound list.Living Up to His Own Hype, Tarver Knocks Out Jones, N.Y. Times article, 2004-04-16, Retrieved on 2013-11-17 Aftermath A little over four months later, Jones returned to face Glen Johnson in an attempt to regain the IBF light heavyweight title (Johnson had defeated Clinton Woods to capture the title after Tarver vacated it just prior to the first fight with Jones). Though Jones came into the fight as a heavy favorite, he trailed Johnson on all three scorecards (75‚Äì77, 75‚Äì77, 74‚Äì78) before he was knocked out for the second consecutive time, this time in the ninth round by an overhand right to the head from Johnson which saw Jones laying down on the canvas for some minutes afterwards, producing an even more shocking knockout loss for Jones than against Tarver in his previous fight.Johnson knocks out Roy Jones in ninth, USA Today article, 2004-09-26, Retrieved on 2013-11-17 After Jones' loss, it was Tarver who fought Johnson next. However, prior to the fight both the WBA and WBC stripped Tarver of their titles while the IBF stripped Johnson of their title after the two men decided to face each other rather than the organizations' mandatory challengers. As a result only Tarver's IBO and The Ring titles were on the line. For the second straight fight, Johnson picked up the upset win after defeating Tarver by split decision (one judge scored the fight 116‚Äì112 in favor of Tarver while the other two judges scored the fight 115‚Äì113 for Johnson).Johnson earns split decision over Tarver, Baltimore Sun article, 2004-12-19, Retrieved on 2013-11-17 After Tarver defeated Johnson by unanimous decision in a rematch to recapture his titles, a rubbermatch with Jones was set for October 1, 2005.

On October 26, NITV transmitted its first broadcast message, a statement by the Shah; test programs were run, and complete programming commenced in Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, in March 1967, with the first week's programs included the broadcasting of the Shah's birthday celebrations from Amjadieh Stadium.A Small Media, Big Revolution: Communication, Culture, and the Iranian Revolution, Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi, Ali Mohammadi, University of Minnesota Press, 1994, pages 66‚Äì67 American Forces Radio and Television Service Until 1976, the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) broadcast a television service on Channel 7 in Tehran and the surrounding area from its studios in the city.Communications and Development Review, Volume 1, Issues 1‚Äì4, Iran Communications and Development Institute, 1977 Catering for US Armed Forces personnel, this was known as AFTV, and was the only television service in the country then carrying programming in English, as all foreign programming on NITV and TVI, including American and British imports, was dubbed in Persian.Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Volume 77, SMPTE, 1968, page 512 In deference to Iranian sensitivities, AFRTS avoided carrying programming that might be construed as offensive on political or religious grounds, instead carrying cowboy or detective movies.Political Elite of Iran, Marvin Zonis, Princeton University Press, 1976, page 247 However, in that year it was decided by the Iranian government that AFRTS should close down its radio and TV services, which it did on October 25.Iran Almanac and Book of Facts, Volume 16, Echo of Iran., 1977, page 125 These would be replaced by similar services, operated by the state broadcaster.

Prior to 1967, television had covered about 2.1 million people; when NIRT began regular transmissions that year, coverage rose to 4.8 million, and by 1974 had risen to over 15 million, roughly half the total population.Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2, Academic Press, 2003, page 617 The large budget allocations that were provided to NIRT, a reflection of the organisation's role in development, enabled it to use the latest technologies, including microwave delivery systems, to overcome problems of mountainous terrain.

It is named after the Alme river and runs through its valley in a north‚Äìsouth direction. The line is disused and dismantled between Paderborn and B√ºren-Weiberg, but it has not been formally closed. The remaining line between B√ºren-Weiberg and Brilon Wald (forest) was for a long time only used for freight and museum trains, but the section between Brilon Stadt (town) and Brilon Wald has been back in use by regional services since 2011.  History  Uerdingen railbus on the line, April 2009 The line was opened between 1898 and 1901. At the same time the Geseke‚ÄìB√ºren railway, which connected to the Hamm‚ÄìWarburg railway, was planned and built.  Opening and operation  The northern section from Paderborn to B√ºren was opened on 20 October 1898 and the rest of the line between B√ºren and Brilon was completed on 1 April 1901. The line was used by passengers and freight traffic, originally hauled by steam locomotives and later by diesel locomotives. Passenger services were eventually operated with diesel multiple units. The large air ammunition depot of Harth, which was concealed in the forest near Ringelstein from 1936 to 1945, was connected to the line at Ringelstein station. In the Second World War, the Alme Valley Railway was more frequently the target of strafing by the Allies from the beginning of 1945. For instance on 13 February 1945 Alme station was raided. Two locomotives were destroyed. Two buildings caught fire and several buildings were hit. From 1950 onwards, the line was connected even to the long-distance network via the daily Heckeneilzug (hedgerow) service, running on the Bremen‚ÄìPaderborn‚ÄìB√ºren‚ÄìBrilon‚ÄìFrankfurt route.  Gradual closure of line and residual traffic  Former Alme Valley Railway station in Brenken Former Alme Valley Railway station in Ahden South portal of the Wewelsburg Tunnel with a length of 143 m Vicinity of the south portal of the Ahden Tunnel with a length of 118 m Regular passenger service between B√ºren and Brilon was closed on the section on 29 September 1974 due to superstructure defects. The Heckeneilzug service continued for some years from Brilon Wald via Warburg towards north Germany. On 30 May 1981, the remaining passenger services on the line were finally closed. There were still regular passenger services on the sections between Paderborn and B√ºren and Brilon Stadt and Brilon Wald. The freight traffic had already been partially closed on 30 May 1965 between B√ºren and Ringelstein. Freight traffic ended between Ringelstein and Alme on 14 April 1975. Freight traffic ran to Alme until 31 July 1991 and to Th√ºlen until 30 May 1992. North of B√ºren, the line was still in use for freight until the end of 1995, but it was then closed. The 10-km stretch between Brilon Wald and the Egger company in Brilon is still regularly used for freight transport and since the timetable change in December 2011 and the line between Brilon Wald and Brilon Stadt is again used for passenger services. The line between Brilon Egger and B√ºren-Weinberg, which is now used by the RWE company for the transport of transformers to the Brilon substation, has been sold and continues to be operated as a branch line.  Attempted revival of the northern section  In 1999, the Westphalian Almetalbahn GmbH (WAB) took over the Paderborn‚ÄìB√ºren section in an attempt to revive the freight traffic and operate excursions with a historic steam train. However, it was only used for individual freight operations and steam excursions. This section of the line was closed on 30 June 2006 as remediation work was necessary and it was dismantled shortly afterwards.  Current condition  Former railbus of the Westf√§lischen Almetalbahn e. V. for reuse on a siding in Hagenow, October 2007  Northern section  The line is run down between Paderborn and B√ºren- Weinberg, but it has not been closed, and there were considerations of using it for a connection to Paderborn Lippstadt Airport. In 2011, the Nahverkehrsverbund (local transport association) Paderborn-H√∂xter decided not to proceed with this on cost grounds.  Southern section  The Brilon Stadt station 2012 Museum tram 431 near Ringelstein in August 2000 The B√ºren- Weiberg‚ÄìTh√ºlen section was used in the summer months from 1981 for the operations of museum trains. This was operated by Dortmund railway enthusiasts as the Westf√§lische Almetalbahn e. V. (WAB), using an old Dortmund GT4 431 tram together with a generator wagon. In 2001, the tram set was replaced by railcars. The association, however, ceased operations on the line several years ago, when the Waldbahn Almetal e. V. took over heritage railway operations on the lower Alme Valley Railway. It operates two Uerdingen railbuses of class 798. The tram is now in the Mooskamp Tram Museum (Nahverkehrsmuseum Dortmund) in Dortmund-Nette. DB Schenker Rail Germany and the Westf√§lische Landes-Eisenbahn (WLE) operate freight for the Egger company on the section from Brilon Wald via Brilon Stadt to Brilon Egger. The section between Th√ºlen and B√ºren, which is leased to RWE AG, is used for the transport of transformers between Buren and the Nehden substation. In 2007, the track between Brilon Wald and Brilon Egger was restored because the Egger company had to increase its operations and rehabilitation of the line was a condition for expanding its site in Brilon. In 2008, platform tracks 1 and 4‚Äì8 in Brilon Stadt station were demolished and the Brilon Arkaden shopping centre was built on the former railway land. Brilon Stadt now retained only two tracks and these were required for freight. Because of the lack of platforms, the museum trains have operated only as far as Th√ºlen since 2008. Since 11 December 2011, Regionalbahn services have extended beyond Brilon Wald to Brilon Stadt again. Its realisation has previously been postponed several times, but at the end of 2008 the Ministry for Construction and Transport of North Rhine-Westphalia agreed to add Brilon Stadt station to its infrastructure financing plan on condition that the Zweckverband SPNV Ruhr-Lippe (association for rail passenger transport of Ruhr-Lippe, ZRL) also funded the line from Brilon Wald to Brilon Stadt. The ZRL decided on 23 June 2009 to resume scheduled regional services on this section from the timetable change of December 2011. A central bus station was also established in Brilon Stadt. A passenger train ran again on the section between Brilon Stadt and Brilon Stadt for the first time in over 30 years on 10 December 2011. Since then, through trains have run to and from Dortmund from Monday to Friday. On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays trains run to and from Bestwig and Korbach.

Built to serve Wayne County in the 1890s, it replaced an older building whose capabilities were seen as inadequate. Wayne County was established by the General Assembly in early 1819, and five men were appointed commissioners to fix the location of the county seat.History of Wayne and Clay Counties Illinois: Illustrated. Chicago: Globe, 1884. Before long, a log building was constructed on the public square in Fairfield, but it remained only a short while: county officials arranged for its replacement in 1836. This second courthouse served a wide range of purposes: rooms not needed for routine governmental functions could be rented out, typically for offices for lawyers and other types of businessmen (although a scandal ensued after a barbershop moved into one room during the courthouse's last years).Weiser, Dennis. Illinois Courthouses: An Illustrated History. Virginia Beach: Donning, 2009, 150. For a time, the courthouse was also made available to churches before they completed their own buildings, but this situation ended after voters elected a slate of county officials who revealed themselves as headstrong infidels by turning out the churches. Two stories tall, the second courthouse was a brick building with a tower high enough to make it visible throughout the surrounding countryside. By the 1880s, it had become dilapidated and was commonly seen as outmoded in comparison to the newer commercial buildings surrounding it. Meanwhile, Fairfield's wooden buildings were highly susceptible to fire, especially because the community had survived into the 1880s without suffering any substantial blazes. As a result, county officials began to fear the destruction of the old building by fire, so they ordered the construction of a new fireproof hall of records in the 1860s ‚Äî only to see it burn to the ground in 1886. Between a sense of the old building's outmoded construction, a desire to possess a truly fireproof structure, and the recent scandal over the barbershop in the courthouse, county officials deemed the time right for the construction of a new courthouse, and blueprints for the new building were approved in 1891. This design called for a brick structure with walls high and a spire culminating above the courthouse lawn. Unlike some other courthouses, which were built around central clock towers, the new Wayne County Courthouse was to have a clock tower on the side, with the main entrance through its base. The completed building cost $24,700. Built of \\"Boston\\" brick,\\"Illinois Historic Sites Survey Inventory: Wayne County Courthouse\\". Springfield: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 1971-04-22. the courthouse features primarily tall rectangular windows in all of its stories. It was modified in the 1950s, as additions were constructed on both sides, and another addition in 1997 installed a new elevator. Another modification has apparently been performed on the spire: comparisons of older and newer photographs demonstrates that the spire was reduced during the twentieth century, but lack of documentation prevents the precise date from being known.

Two songs were arranged and recorded exclusively for the film by Eric Lane Barnes - his original composition \\"Everything is on Fire\\" performed by Sarah Rudinoff and a techno version of \\"Cold Song\\" performed by Nick Garison. Wade Madsen, Anna Allen, Inga Ingenue and Waxie Moon choreographed the film's many dance sequences. Several hundred looks were created for over 200 performers by the costume and makeup designer, Harmony Arnold. The Genius-award winner Jennifer Zeyl served as the art director for the film. Although, primarily a comedy, Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel experiments with narrative structure by switching genres to mirror Waxie's social standing and emotional state, and in the process eschews Hollywood's traditional treatment of its female protagonists. Other experimental elements in the film include the generous use of Bertolt Brecht's alienation effect and its highly stylized movement and blocking, which often reference choreographers such as Martha Graham.

Its location just across the river from Canada, where slavery was abolished in 1834, made it a destination for many seeking freedom. Although Michigan was a free territory, some refugee slaves wanted to go over the border to Canada to prevent being captured by slavecatchers. Others settled in Detroit.

Thesis (M.A.)--Central Michigan University, 1967. Blacks in Detroit had to face rising tensions from ethnic whites before and after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in January 1863. A Democratic Party paper, The Detroit Free Press, supported white supremacy and opposed President Abraham Lincoln's handling of the war. In addition, it consistently presented issues of the day as problems due to competition with free blacks, projecting threats to white men's power and forecasting worse labor problems if the mass of slaves were freed. On March 1863, a race riot broke out in Detroit. Catalyzed by the arrest of a mixed-race man for allegedly molesting a white girl, a white mob attacked blacks and their neighborhood, resulting in two deaths (one, white and one black), numerous people injured, 35 houses and businesses destroyed, and more than 200 people left homeless. As a result, the city established its first full-time police force. 1865-1890 After the war, African Americans formed an important political block in the city, led by Watson, George DeBaptist, John D. Richards, and Walter Y. Clark.\\"The Colored Voters\\", Detroit Free Press (Detroit, Michigan), 30 April 1874, page 1, accessed December 13, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7841273/the_colored_voters_detroit_free_press/ Saginaw's William Q.

In the 1890s, journalist and founder of the black paper, Detroit Plaindealer, Robert Pelham Jr. and lawyer D. Augustus Straker worked in Detroit and throughout the state to create branches of the National Afro-American League. The pair were active, in part through the league, in supporting blacks in legal trouble.Alexander, Shawn Leigh. An Army of Lions: The Civil Rights Struggle Before the NAACP. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011, p36 Pelham was also an important figure in the league at a national level.Alexander 2011, p326 The first major period of black growth occurred from 1910 to 1930, during the economic expansion in the auto industry. At the time in Detroit, most blacks lived in mixed communities containing other racial groups, often recent European immigrants, as both groups were making their way and had to take older housing.Metzger, Kurt and Jason Booza. \\"African Americans in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit .\\" (Archive) Center for Urban Studies, Wayne State University.

They recruited African Americans from the South, who were also on the move as part of the first Great Migration. They sought more opportunity and a chance to leave behind the oppression of the Jim Crow South. From 1910‚Äì1930, the black population of Detroit increased from under 6,000 to over 120,000, as the city developed as the fourth largest in the country. By 1920, of Michigan's black population, 87% was born outside of the state, and most of those came from the South.Metzger, Kurt and Jason Booza. \\"African Americans in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit .\\" (Archive) Center for Urban Studies, Wayne State University. February 2002. Working Paper Series, No. 8. p. 9. Retrieved on November 9, 2013. Because landlords began to restrict access to housing, blacks were forced into small districts, which became overcrowded as the population grew. T. J. Sugrue, author of The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit, wrote that the first geographic racial divisions between whites and blacks developed during the Great Migration. In 1912 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) founded a Detroit chapter. The Detroit Urban League was founded in 1916. Both organizations used the support of black churches. Steve Babson, author of Working Detroit: The Making of a Union Town, wrote that in the early 20th century the black population \\"was relatively behind the middle-class leadership\\" of the NAACP and the Urban League.Babson, p. 28. Around the 1920s and 1930s black people working in Henry Ford's factories settled in Inkster because they did not want to commute from Detroit and they were not allowed to live in Dearborn.Binelli, p. 25. \\"The blacks working at the Rouge didn't necessarily want to commute all the way from Detroit but they weren't welcome in Dearborn, so they began settling in the regrettably named suburb of Inkster (which in fact commemorates an early Scottish settler, Robert Inkster).\\" Whites resisted even middle-class blacks moving into their neighborhoods. In 1925 the State of Michigan charged physician Ossian Sweet with murder after he used a shotgun to kill a white man who was part of a mob trying to force him to leave his newly purchased house, located in a mostly white neighborhood. Sweet was acquitted of his charges.Carrillo, p. 265. 1930-present During the Great Depression, the population stagnated. The black population growth was at the lowest rate since 1910. As the US entry into World War II disrupted the labor market by drafting numbers of young men, the demand for labor grew with the expansion of the war industries. Sections of the auto industry were converted to wartime production of the arsenal and vehicles needed for war, and a new wave of blacks migrated from the South. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an Executive Order to prevent discrimination among defense contractors, increasing opportunities for minorities in the range of jobs and supervisory positions. This was resisted by some working-class whites. In the period from 1940 to 1950, more than 66% of the black population in Detroit had been born outside the area, with most born in the South.Metzger, Kurt and Jason Booza. \\"African Americans in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit .\\" (Archive) Center for Urban Studies, Wayne State University. February 2002. Working Paper Series, No. 8. p. 10. Retrieved on November 9, 2013. The increase in population had strained city schools and services for all residents. = Housing Crisis = Competition in employment and housing spheres increased social tensions in the city. Insufficient housing opportunities for African Americans led to a polarized political and economic landscape. The government attempted to ease the housing pressure by building projects for working-class families, but whites resented placement of these projects in their neighborhoods. As a result, black housing was allocated in deeply impoverished areas that regressed into further dangerous and disease filled locations.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 37. ] Since black individuals were forced to take low-earning jobs, the density of black families in this area known as \\"black bottom\\" increased, and further exacerbated its destitute living conditions.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 34. .] Federal housing policies effectively stymied the progress of African Americans in the city of Detroit, and, consequently, housing shortages disproportionately targeted African American citizens. Residential segregation was prevalent as structures of disinvestment amplified hypersegregation along both racial and economic lines. In 1935, the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLB) commissioned 239 lending maps for the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) to document and evaluate what neighborhoods throughout the country were lending risks. Many areas of Detroit were redlined as a result of being designated \\"high risk\\" neighborhoods. Neighborhoods that were graded as hazardous for lending were primarily composed of minority groups, and these redlined neighborhoods illustrated the ways in which economic inequality disproportionately targeted African Americans. Citizens residing in these neighborhoods were denied loans by lending institutions, and consequently they were unable to purchase or fix homes. Since black individuals were not able to leave their impoverished neighborhoods and were not able to improve their homes through loans, the concentration of poverty within black bottom increased.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 43. .] Such policies worsen the condition of black housing solely on the basis of race. The lack of mobility for black people reaffirmed stereotypes white communities held about the moral integrity of black neighborhoods because of the destitute conditions black communities were stuck in. Federal policies further exacerbated segregation through the use of racial covenants within the city. Racial covenants were legally bound contracts that outlawed the residency of African Americans within a given area.\\"Detroit Housing Discrimination\\" By 1940, 80% of Detroit's residencies abided by racial covenants, and thereby restricted black housing to historically impoverished and dangerous areas on the basis of race. Though the use of redlining and racial covenants contributed to segregation within housing for African Americans, African Americans were displaced from their homes through urban redevelopment. In efforts to improve the city's conditions, highways, hospitals and apartment buildings were set to be created by removing and eradicating Detroit's \\"slums\\" that were located in black communities by the Detroit City Planning Commission (CPC).[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 49. .] Having Detroit's city leadership in the 1940s and 1950s attribute redevelopment and renovation with destroying \\"dangerous\\" parts of the city made black bottom especially vulnerable to displacement. The CPC subsequently failed to provide adequate resources for relocation to the black families whose homes and neighborhoods were destroyed.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 50. .] The disappearance of culture is a by-product of this policy, since the displacement of black families eventually brought with it a disappearance of black culture and tradition. Systematic discrimination in housing contributed to volatile race relations in the city of Detroit. The most important pro- public housing coalition was the Citizens' Housing and Planning Council (CHPC). The goal of this organization was to improve environmental conditions in slums by replacing suboptimal living and sanitary conditions with more adequate housing for African Americans. This reform aimed to ameliorate poor living spaces and construct a cleaner environment that was more conducive to public health and morale. This organization inevitably faced opposition from anti-public housing groups and white homeowners who were fixated on maintaining racial homogeneity in their neighborhoods. After the decision of Shelly v. Kramer banned racial covenants, efforts to keep neighborhoods segregated were propelled by Homeowners associations.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 182. ] Members from white concentrated neighborhoods organized and used grassroots activism to prevent integration from sullying the ‚Äúhigh character‚Äù that their white dominated neighborhoods provided.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 214. ] These associations flexed their agencies in a number of ways. Through the use of mutual reciprocal legal agreements, homeowners associations maintained racially specific language to bar black people from obtaining loans in white populated areas.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 221. ] Further, homeowners associations leveraged the ownership of the homes in their neighborhood to safeguard sales to black individuals. Associations such as the Plymouth Manor association required its members to only contract with approved real estate brokers that would guarantee that loans and property would only be sold to white individuals.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 222. ] The legal power of the Homeowners associations was furthered when entering into administrative positions with Mayor Albert Cobo. Cobo opted to have several members of homeowners associations counsel zoning and urban development policies which attempted to further enforce de facto segregation within Detroit. The influence of homeowners associations within the Cobo administration stretched as far as playing an integral role in disbanding the Mayor's Interacial Committee (MIC) which was aimed at facilitating integration within the city, and turning it into the Commission on Community Relations (CCR). The CCR was composed of homeowners association members and perpetuated segregated housing standards by emphasizing rights that belong to white homeowners to resist integration throughout the city.[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 225. ] Racism within housing was therefore still intact after it was federally banned through these extralegal loopholes that were spearheaded by white homeowners associations. The actions of the homeowners associations reflected the deep cultural ties that Detroiters developed within their neighborhoods. Historians have previously connected homeowners associations‚Äô efforts to prevent integration to be tied to the sense of identity within the segregated neighborhoods in Detroit. Since the housing shortage affected both white and black populations, people clung onto aspects of their community for the feeling of security within housing. Segregated Detroit neighborhoods facilitated for this feeling of safety and stability to then be linked to race. Once this sentiment of safety was threatened with integration of black residents who have been construed as dangerous and inhumane, the agency of white homeowners associations was actualized. = 1943 Riot = Postwar tensions and animosities culminated in the race riots of 1943. This riot started with a conflict among young men at Belle Isle, and it quickly spread into the city, inciting violence between whites and blacks. Although at the time blacks were largely blamed for the violence, studies have found that many young armed whites traveled across the city to attack majority-black areas east of Woodward Avenue. By contrast, blacks arrested in the riot tended to be mature family men who had lived longer in the city and were defending their homes. The riot ended when 6,000 soldiers of the United States Army intervened to keep the peace and order in the city. As a result of this riot, white citizens learned to use violence to gain leverage in political and housing contentions. = Civil Rights Movement = The civil rights movement in the South affected minorities in northern and western states as well. In Detroit, activists pushed for more representation in local government, including the white-dominated police force, and for equal justice in housing and employment. At the same time, African Americans were proud of their progress in Detroit. In 1965 the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History was founded in the city. According to columnist Keith Richburg, in the 1960s a social divide developed between the many black people from Alabama and those from South Carolina; they lived east and west of Woodward Avenue, respectively. The migrants from South Carolina believed they were more refined than those from Alabama, who were from rural areas and thought to be lower class. Richburg described the divide as \\"more psychological than geographic\\". From 1950 to 1970 de facto racial segregation in the Metro Detroit area increased. Those white people who were more established economically moved out of the city to newly developed suburbs, which often were divided by class and income levels. In that period black growth in the suburbs averaged 2.7%, while in previous decades it had been 5%. Social tensions increased as blacks felt oppressed by discrimination, a majority-white police force, and restricted housing. Resentments erupted in the widespread destruction and violence in black neighborhoods of the Detroit riot of 1967, considered the worst in urban America. That summer similar riots erupted in numerous cities across the country. Both middle-class whites and blacks began to leave Detroit in greater number. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, there was renewed violence in a civil disturbance along 12th Street, the center of the 1967 unrest. It was quickly controlled. In the 1970s, the number of middle-class blacks moving to the suburbs increased, as they also sought newer housing, better schools, and neighborhoods with less poverty and crime. = Auto Industry = Pressures on the auto industry and restructuring of heavy manufacturing across the region caused high job losses, adding to the strains of the city. Overall population in the metro area declined, with many people moving to other areas for work. Detroit suffered concentrated poverty in sections, where people were unable to leave. The quality of schools declined, creating a cycle that appeared to trap people in place. The city struggled to support those in need at a time of declining revenues. = Demographic Changes and Suburbanization = By 1970 Detroit and six other municipalities, Ecorse, Highland Park, Inkster, Pontiac, River Rouge, and Royal Oak Township, had higher than average black populations. The six suburban municipalities with higher than average black populations held a total of 78.5% of the suburban black people in the tri-county area.Metzger, Kurt and Jason Booza. \\"African Americans in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit .\\" (Archive) Center for Urban Studies, Wayne State University. February 2002. Working Paper Series, No. 8. p. 11. Retrieved on November 9, 2013. During this suburbanization period, many middle-class blacks also moved from Detroit to Southfield.Binelli, p. 133. Suburban development and growth increased among all populations, and blacks became more widely distributed. By 2000, blacks in the six suburban municipalities that had held the great majority in 1970 made up only 34% of the blacks in the suburbs. From 1990 to 2000, black people migrating to the suburbs constituted almost half of the total population growth there. In the decade 1990‚Äì2000, the highest number of blacks moved into the Detroit suburbs of any decade in the 20th century. In that decade, the black population of Southfield increased by more than 20,000 people. At the same time, the total number of black people in Detroit decreased for the first time in the city's history. But other ethnic decreases resulted in black people in the city making up a higher percentage of its overall population: from 76% to 82%.Metzger, Kurt and Jason Booza. \\"African Americans in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit .\\" (Archive) Center for Urban Studies, Wayne State University. February 2002. Working Paper Series, No. 8. p. 13. Retrieved on November 9, 2013. As of 2002, a total of 90% of the black population in Wayne, Macomb, and Oakland counties resided in Detroit, Highland Park, Inkster, Pontiac, and Southfield. Migration of black families out of Detroit continued. By 2010 Southfield became 70% black. In 2010 9% of Macomb County's population was black,Binelli, p. 134. and the black population in Warren from 2000 to 2010 increased from 4,000 to 18,000.Binelli, p. 133-134. By 2011 black suburbanization had increased across the area, as blacks settled in more different localities. By 2011 black suburbanization had increased across the metro region, no longer limited to a few communities. From 2000 to 2010, Detroit had lost around 200,000 people, as many families continued to leave the ailing city. The housing market in Metro Detroit declined during the Great Recession, enabling some blacks to move into areas that had previously been too expensive. At the same time, many white suburbanites were unable to sell their houses so stayed in place, resulting in the development of more integrated neighborhoods. Mark Binelli, author of Detroit City is the Place to Be, wrote \\"In a funny way, the recession had helped this integration along.\\" Some suburban residents, including middle- class blacks, resented the new arrivals, feeling they brought unwelcome patterns of behavior that disrupted the peace of the suburbs.

Description Beetles of this genus are cylindrical in shape, 3 to 6.5 millimeters long, and reddish to black in color. The back end of the elytra is concave, and there is a ridge of 3 to 6 large spines on either side of the depression. The number and shape of the spines help to distinguish the species from one another. The genus is distinguished from other groups in the tribe Ipini by the flat, oval shape of the clubs at the tips of the antennae and by details of the concavity in the elytra and of the male genitalia.Cognato, A. I. and A. P. Vogler. (2001). Exploring data interaction and nucleotide alignment in a multiple gene analysis of Ips (Coleoptera: Scolytinae). Syst Biol 50(6) 758-80. The oblong white eggs are up to a millimeter long. The grub-like larvae are whitish with reddish heads and lack legs. Biology These bark beetles live in and feed on the phloem in the inner layer of bark on trees. They usually inhabit dead, dying, and stressed trees, including fallen trees, cut logs, and slash. They can be found in trees that are already damaged by drought, lightning, human activity, or pest infestation. They are specialists on conifers, attacking many species of pine (Pinus) and spruce (Picea). Less often, they are found on hemlocks (Tsuga) and firs (Abies). Most Ips, like most all beetles of the tribe Ipini, have a polygynous mating system with harems of females.Reid, M. (1999). Monogamy in the bark beetle Ips latidens: ecological correlates of an unusual mating system. Ecological Entomology 24(1), 89-94. Typically, a male establishes a nuptial chamber in a log and produces an aggregation pheromone that attracts both males and females. The males dig additional chambers and each female joins one of the males, digging an extension onto his nuptial chamber where she deposits her eggs. A male may have a harem of up to 8 females.Symonds, M. R., et al. (2012). Reproductive consequences of male arrival order in the bark beetle, Ips grandicollis. Journal of Insect Behavior 25(4), 401-07. Exceptions are I. latidens and I. avulsus, which are monogamous in nature. The aggregation pheromones usually contain two or more active attractant compounds, such as ipsdienol, ipsenol, and cis-verbenol.Symonds, M. R. and M. A. Elgar. (2004). The mode of pheromone evolution: evidence from bark beetles. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences 271(1541), 839-46. The beetles are called engravers because of the long, grooved galleries they excavate in the sapwood. As the female digs her branch off of the male's nuptial chamber, she deposits eggs in individual niches along the walls. When the larva emerges, it digs a tunnel off of its niche. The multibranched engraved galleries that result are often Y-, H-, or I-shaped. Ips galleries are clear and open, unlike those of some other bark beetles, which are filled with wood dust and frass. The beetles grow and develop more quickly during the warmer seasons. In the summer, I. grandicollis and I. calligraphus can complete an entire life cycle in 25 days, and there can be up to 8 generations per year. I. avulsus can complete a life cycle in just 18 days and have 10 generations per year. After pupation, the new adult beetle disperses from its birthplace and can fly several miles to locate an appropriate host tree in which to breed. Some species overwinter in aggregations inside the galleries, while others seek shelter in the outer bark layers or the leaf litter. Effects on trees Ips avulsus infestation in loblolly pines (Pinus taeda) As native species, these beetles are a natural part of their environment, excavating snags and providing food for insectivores. I. typographus is described as \\"an essential component of every spruce forest ecosystem\\" as it digs through dead and dying wood tissue, helping to initiate the process of decomposition.Wermelinger, B. (2004). Ecology and management of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus‚Äîa review of recent research. Forest Ecology and Management 202(1), 67-82. In an abundance of dead and dying trees, after windthrow events, for instance, the beetles take advantage of plentiful food and shelter resources and their populations increase drastically. If the resources then dwindle, the large populations move into stands of healthy trees and become a problematic infestation. Their damage is usually not as severe as that of certain beetles in the genus Dendroctonus, which sometimes share the habitat. Ips outbreaks are less common and usually shorter in duration, though severe outbreaks of Ips typographus in Europe in the 1990s inspired many new research studies of ips engravers. A living tree can be killed by the feeding activity of adults and larvae, which damages the phloem in such a way that the tree is girdled. The beetles also introduce several species of fungi which invade and infect the wood, blocking the xylem. The first sign of an Ips infestation in a tree may be the discoloration of the needles that occurs when fungi block the xylem and prevent water transport to the foliage. Several species of blue stain fungus can be vectored by the beetles, including those of the genera Ophiostoma and Ceratocystis. Other signs of Ips infestation include particles of wood dust accumulating on the bark, foliage, and nearby objects as a result of the beetles' tunneling activity. The wood dust can mix with resin that bleeds from the injury site, creating whitish or reddish pitch tubes, but these are more common in Dendroctonus infestations. Woodpeckers spend time on infested trees, chipping off bark as they forage for the beetles. Management Insecticides are not effective for active Ips infestations. Instead they are used to prevent the beetles' spread to healthy trees, such as landscaping conifers, newly transplanted trees, and healthy stands adjacent to outbreaks. The beetles are attracted to freshly cut wood, so logs and slash are chipped, dried, or removed from vulnerable areas. Infested wood can be chipped, stripped of bark, or solarized in plastic to kill the beetles. If the sounds of related but different species of beetles, such as western pine beetles and southern pine beetles (which both feed on pinyon but never live together), are played into a tree the beetles present will tear each other apart.Rothenberg, David (2013). Bug Music, p.137. St. Martin's Press. . Taxonomy There are 37 species in the genus. In a 2001 revision it was divided into four subgenera.

The name also served as propaganda at the beginning of transition to Christianity. Since \\"Apistlia¬ª was an offensive word, changed over time, to antonym Pitsilias. In 653 AD due to the Arab invasion, the area of Pitsilias became the bastion of resistance, after strengthened by refugees and retreating soldiers. Mainly because of the small number (10000 Army), and after a few unsuccessful attempts, Rashidun Caliphate drafted peace treaty with local leaders of Pitsilias avoiding the ravages of guerrilla warfare At 704AD a peace treaty between Umayyad Caliphate and Tiberios III was broken. Tiberios facilitated the repatriation of thousands of Cypriot war prisoners from Cyzicus Propontis. A large number of them settled in the region bringing the relics of the Holy Icons. Their freedom and repatriation was credited by them as a miracle through the Holy Icons' intercessions. After a few years later another miracle occurred - a general amnesty pardon for all fugitives, outlaws and militants in the area. The fame of the miracle Holy icons spread all over Cyprus and overseas. These facts led to the establishment of feasts and festivals to commemorate the Holy Icons. The thousands of pilgrims contribute to the economic growth of the region, an economic growth and stability that lasted over a period of four centuries.

Kleargear.com, no. 13-cv-00175 (D. Utah, filed Dec. 18, 2013), is a 2013 federal lawsuit in which an internet retailer was sued by two of its customers after it billed the customers for $3,500 following a negative review. The retailer, Kleargear.com, specializes in nerd apparel, geek toys, gadgets and office toys; it is owned by Paris-based Descoteaux Boutiques. The plaintiffs charged the company with violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In March 2014, the district court entered a default judgment for the plaintiffs, and in June 2014 awarded damages of $306,750. As of 2015, the Palmers continue to attempt to collect the judgment. The internet retailer's charge to the consumer was based on an anti-disparagement clause of their site's terms and conditions. The case led to a California statute prohibiting the enforcement of such clauses, and the introduction of the Consumer Review Freedom Act of 2015, a proposed bill that, since passed, has enacted similar prohibitions at the federal level. History The plaintiffs, John and Jen Palmer, attempted to purchase a desk ornament and keychain from the company at a price under $20. Kleargear.com never delivered. PayPal automatically canceled the order in December 2008. Soon after, Jen left a negative review at Ripoff Report. In May 2012, the company sent a bill to Jen Palmer of Layton, Utah for $3,500 based on an anti-disparagement clause of their site's terms and conditions unless they agreed to take down the review.Kim, Nancy S., Exploitation by Wrap Contracts -- Click 'Agree' (June 2, 2014). California Bar IP Journal, New Matter, Vol. 39, no. 2, pp. 10-17 (2014). Ripoff Report has a policy of not removing reviews; statements of fact could only be removed if a $2,000 arbitration fee was paid and the arbitrator determined that those statements were false. When Palmer and her husband John refused to pay, Kleargear reported the fine for collection, which dragged down their credit rating. One issue in the dispute was whether the disparagement clause had been present when the plaintiffs had made their order in 2008. In 2013, after examining archives of Kleargear's Terms of Service at the Internet Archive, KUTV and TechDirt stated that the clause had not been present and had been added to the site in June 2012. In 2014, Kleargear stated that the clause had been present in 2008. Following an internet backlash, Kleargear closed its Facebook page and protected its Twitter account. Businessweek called the public backlash an example of the Streisand effect. Both the Better Business Bureau and TRUSTe have issued statements that Kleargear used their logos without permission and have begun investigations. Experian has also begun an investigation on the credit report. On November 25, 2013, Public Citizen, representing the Palmers, sent an open letter demanding that Kleargear pay the Palmers $75,000, remove the taint on their credit rating, and cease and desist from using the non- disparagement clause in the future. Kleargear ignored a December 16, 2013 deadline to respond to the offer, and Public Citizen sued the company in federal court for Fair Credit Reporting Act violations, defamation, and other torts. According to attorney Scott Michelman, numerous attempts to get in touch with Kleargear before the suit were unsuccessful. In March 2014, United States District Court judge Dee Benson entered a default judgment in favor of the Palmers. Kleargear stated to the press that the default judgment was not valid because notice should have been served to its parent company in France. Judge Benson awarded the Palmers $306,750 in compensatory and punitive damages on June 25, 2014. On July 24, the Palmers filed a motion for $47,596.86 in attorneys' fees and expenses.Palmer & Kulas v. Kleargear.com, no. 13-00175, D.

Utah, Docket entry 25 (Feb. 15, 2015), retrieved from PACER, October 30, 2015 Responding to the Palmers' experience with KlearGear, California enacted a law in 2014 banning the use of non-disparagement clauses in consumer contracts. Similar bans were introduced in both houses of Congress in 2015, and Jen Palmer testified live before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in November 2015. Public Citizen submitted written testimony to the Committee as well. With Public Citizen's support, the Consumer Review Freedom Act passed the Senate in December 2015.retrieved from , May 10, 2016 In April 2015, the Palmers and the Slates firm filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to enforce the judgment by garnishment of Kleargear assets, including levies with credit card companies Discover Bank, American Express Centurion Bank, MasterCard International, and Visa Inc., as well as PayPal, Inc. against accounts held by Kleargear with those companies.Palmer, et al. v. Kleargear.com, no. 15-03656, C.D. Cal. (filed Apr. 30, 2015), retrieved from PACER, October 30, 2015 As of October 2015, the case is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge George H. King. Further implications Inspired by the Palmers' experience with KlearGear, the California legislature passed a bill in 2014 to ban the use of non-disparagement clauses in consumer contracts, and Governor Jerry Brown signed it into law on September 9, 2014. In September 2015, the Consumer Review Freedom Act of 2015 () was introduced in the U.S. Congress, to make such clauses void and unenforceable at the federal level. U.S. Senator Jerry Moran cited the Kleargear case as one basis for the bill. The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation scheduled hearings on the bill for November 4, 2015. Among those scheduled to testify were Jen Palmer, a plaintiff in Palmer v. KlearGear; Adam Medros, vice-president of TripAdvisor; Daniel Castro, vice-president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation; Eric Goldman, a law professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law; and Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. In November 2016, the amended Consumer Review Freedom Act of 2015 titled the Consumer Review Fairness Act of 2016 () unanimously passed in the Senate. On December 15, 2016, it was signed into law by Barack Obama. ReferencesExternal links=Legal documents, Palmer v. Kleargear, no. 13-cv-00175 (D.

Description Situated about south east of the Looma Community and about south east of Derby in the Kimberley region, the property has a frontage on the Fitzroy River, which forms its southern boundary. Comprising an area of , it has a carrying capacity of over 22,000 head of cattle. The livestock manager since 2010 has been Peter \\"Jed\\" O'Brien, but the property also grows fodder for livestock using three centre-pivot irrigators and is experimenting with tropical grain crops. The station contains large areas of river flats that are quite fertile and grow a variety of herbage suitable for fodder, including Mitchell grass, Flinders grass, rice grass, ribbon grass and bundle bundle. The growth is so prolific that the areas have been cut and baled as a reserve for the dry season. The homestead group consists of the main house, workers' kitchen and dining Room, meat house, shearers' quarters, workshop and the garden. The main house has stone walls with cement mortar and corrugated iron roofing. The surrounding verandah has steel supports and unlined timber purloins. It was built in the 1880s and 1890s and was classified by the National Trust in 2005. History The Kimberley Pastoral Company was formed in 1881 and won the lottery to acquire the leasehold for the area of land. The syndicate consisted of William Marmion, M. C. Davies, brothers George and William Silas Pearse, and Robert Frederick Sholl, with brothers William and John McLarty as minor shareholders. The vessel Amur was chartered to take A. Cornish and the McLarty brothers along with sheep, horses, cattle and provisions from Fremantle to King Sound. Upon landing, the stock were driven to Yeeda Creek for fresh water before continuing inland to set up camp at Liveringa. The first homestead, shearing shed, woolshed and storeroom were constructed between 1886 and 1888. The homestead and outbuildings were constructed under the supervision of John McLarty the inaugural manager of the property. The buildings were situated on a knoll with a view over a billabong and the Fitzroy River. The original homestead was made of bush timbers and corrugated iron and was demolished in 1908 by the third manager of Liveringa, Percy Rose, who was building a new one. The new homestead was constructed of local sandstone. In 1911 the station was carrying a flock of 98,000 sheep and yielded a clip of 1419 bales of wool. The property and surrounding areas were severely flooded in 1914, and again in 1938 resulting in the death of a former jockey, William Skinner, who drowned in the flooded Nerrima River. Kim Rose was appointed manager at Liveringa in 1930; Rose was a director of the Kimberley Pastoral company that owned the property. Later the same year a freak deluge of rain left of land underwater and drowned 30,000 sheep. In 1949 the property occupied and the station recorded over of rain in a week, resulting in more stock losses. It had of fencing dividing the property into 60 paddocks. For the previous few years an average of 57,000 sheep had been shorn each year. The area was struck by drought between 1951 and 1953 with the number of cattle being reduced by half. This was the first drought suffered by pastoralists in 70 years, with many hurriedly sinking bores and buying feed to keep their stock alive. Other nearby properties that were affected were Noonkanbah, Cherrabun, Quandan, Gogo, Glenroy, Fossil Downs, Luilugui, Christmas Creek and Bohemia Downs Station. The Australian Land and Cattle Company was incorporated in 1969 in Western Australia by Jack Miller Fletcher and Corey Crutcher. At its height, the company owned seven prime Kimberley stations covering nearly and carrying 100,000 head of cattle. Among the properties acquired were Camballin and Liveringa stations. At Liveringa the company cleared of land to grow sorghum under flood irrigation; the crop was then used in company feedlots to fatten cattle. In 1972 the last of the sheep were sold off to stations in the Pilbara and the only stock remaining were cattle. The Australian Land and Cattle Company collapsed in the 1980s. In 1973, a portion of the property to the west of the homestead was excised and reserved for the Looma Community. In 2002 the property commenced the process of gradually changing the genetic base of the herd by introducing a crossbreeding program to produce red lines suitable for live export or sale into southern markets. Red brangus bulls were introduced over the brahman-based herd at another property, Nerrima, and the heifers produced taken to Liveringa. Gina Rinehart acquired a 50% stake in both Liveringa and neighbouring Nerrima Station in 2014. Rinehart teamed up with agribusiness group Milne Agrigroup who already owned the properties. Liveringa was stocked with approximately 22,000 head of cattle. The half share was acquired for 40 million.

Junior high school education is compulsory in Taiwan. Children and youths aged 6 to 15 are required to receive nine years of compulsory education. By law, every pupil who completed his or her primary education must attend a junior high school for at least three years, with exemptions to homeschooling and severe disorder or disabilities. Legal guardians of offenders may be subjected to fines up to NT$300, where penalties may be repeatedly imposed until offenders return to school.Article 2 of Regulation for the exchange rate between New Taiwan Dollars and the fiat currency in the laws of the Republic of China reads, \\"Wherever the laws and regulations in force specifies the amount of monies in the currency unit of Yuan (Âúì), Silver Yuan, or Yuan (ÂÖÉ), that is three times the New Taiwan Dollar.\\" Therefore the highest fine of, e.g. \\"100 yuan\\", stated in all laws of the Republic of China, is equivalent to NT$300. History=Empire of Japan The history of secondary education in Taiwan dates back to the Japanese rule. In 1896, Taiwan's colonial government implemented the policy of Direct Schools System, which was the first modern schooling system with reference to the Western system in the history of education in Taiwan. Japan later made three revisions to the educational policy in Taiwan and made use of education to promote militarism and loyalty to the Empire of Japan. Republic of China In August 1945, the Pacific War ended and Taiwan was handed over to the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China. The current secondary education system in Taiwan was formed in 1968, in which the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China implemented nine years of compulsory education to enhance the level of knowledge of Taiwanese. Upon completion of studies in a junior high school, students may opt to pursue further studies or enter workforce. For those pursuing further studies, 2014 graduates could take the Comprehensive Assessment Program (Âúã‰∏≠ÊïôËÇ≤ÊúÉËÄÉ) or the Special Entrance Examination (ÁâπËâ≤ÊãõÁîüËÄÉË©¶). Several educational reforms were vastly promoted, which included the extension and normalization of education and independent learning. The calls for extension of years of education started in 1983, and came to a consensus in 2003. It was announced in 2011 that the Twelve Years of Basic Education (ÂçÅ‰∫åÂπ¥ÂúãÊ∞ëÂü∫Êú¨ÊïôËÇ≤) will be implemented three years later, where education in Taiwan will be extended from nine years to twelve years, while the current promotion system to a senior high school will be abolished. This causes a fundamental impact on Secondary education in Taiwan. Period Taiwan uses the Minguo calendar system. A school year consists of two semesters, with the fall semester begins in early September every year and runs through late January or early February. The spring semester begins in mid February and ends in early June. Semester breaks typically last for around two or three weeks surrounding the Spring Festival and Lunar New Year. Statistics on education are according to each academic year, while expenditures according to each fiscal year.http://wenr.wes.org/2010/05/wenr-may-2010-feature/ Subjects and medium of instruction In junior high schools, subjects covered including literature, mathematics, English, science, technology, social studies, home economics and craft, arts and physical education. The language used in both junior and senior high schools is Mandarin at all levels. However, English classes are mandatory throughout the whole secondary education period. Students Taiwanese junior high school students According to the Educational Statistics of the Republic of China (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤Áµ±Ë®à), Taiwan has 932 junior high schools in total, 844,884 students and 880 full-time teachers in those schools, as of the 101st academic year (August 2012 to July 2013). There has been a steep increase in those numbers since the implementation of nine years of compulsory education, which reflects the growth and changes in the junior high school education in Taiwan. For students, the proportion of the number of students dropped from 93.96% in the 39th academic year (August 1950 to July 1951) to 50.18% in the 98th academic year (August 2009 to July 2010), showing the change in the educational structure of Taiwan. Another fact worth mentioning is the change in proportion of genders. In the 39th academic year (August 1950 to July 1951), there were 40,670 boys, which nearly doubled that of the 20,412 girls. However, as of the 101st academic year (August 2012 to July 2013), the difference in the proportion of boys and girls significantly reduced, where there was 440,711 boys and 404,173 girls. This indicates that under the compulsory education policy and the rise in feminism, the education conditions for girls have improved. In addition to this, the promotion rates of students in junior high schools increased from 51.15% to 99.15% from the 39th to the 101st academic year. In other words, currently in Taiwan, almost every student can be promoted and pursue further studies.http://www.wes.org/ewenr/10may/feature.htm Schools For schools, in the 39th academic year, there were only 66 junior high schools. After the implementation of compulsory education, junior high schools were set up to meet the goal of One Junior High School in Each Township (‰∏ÄÈÑâÈéÆ‰∏ÄÂúã‰∏≠). In the fiscal year of 2009, the total expenditure on education was NT$802.3 billion, which was 5.83% of the Gross domestic product (GDP). Aboriginal and non- Taiwanese education As for the aboriginal education, there were 72,652 aboriginal students studying in junior high schools in the 101st academic year. The first five groups in terms of student population are: Amis (26,113), Atayal (13,410), Paiwan (12,946), Bunun (8,113) and Truku (4,600). In that academic year, there were a total of 41,525 students who were new immigrants; sorted by the nationality (non-ROC national) of a parent, the first three countries are: People's Republic of China (16,221), Vietnam (10,690) and Indonesia (8,099), where they sum up to comprise 84.30% of the total number of new-immigrant student population. As for overseas Taiwanese, there were 206 students who returned to Taiwan to attend a junior high school in the 98th academic year (August 2009 to July 2010), mainly those residing in Indonesia (60), followed by the United States (29).

The motivation for developing hybrid machine translation systems stems from the failure of any single technique to achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy. Many hybrid machine translation systems have been successful in improving the accuracy of the translations, and there are several popular machine translation systems which employ hybrid methods. Among these are PROMT, SYSTRAN and Omniscien Technologies (formerly Asia Online). Approaches=Multi-engine This approach to hybrid machine translation involves running multiple machine translation systems in parallel. The final output is generated by combining the output of all the sub-systems. Most commonly, these systems use statistical and rule-based translation subsystems,Hutchins, J. 2007. Machine translation: A concise history. Computer-aided translation: Theory and practice. but other combinations have been explored. For example, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have had some success combining example-based, transfer-based, knowledge-based and statistical translation sub-systems into one machine translation system.Hogan, C. and Frederking, R. 1998. An Evaluation of the Multi-engine MT Architecture. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1529 pp. 113-123. Statistical rule generation This approach involves using statistical data to generate lexical and syntactic rules. The input is then processed with these rules as if it were a rule-based translator. This approach attempts to avoid the difficult and time-consuming task of creating a set of comprehensive, fine-grained linguistic rules by extracting those rules from the training corpus. This approach still suffers from many problems of normal statistical machine translation, namely that the accuracy of the translation will depend heavily on the similarity of the input text to the text of the training corpus. As a result, this technique has had the most success in domain-specific applications, and has the same difficulties with domain adaptation as many statistical machine translation systems.Chang, J. and Su, K. 1997. Corpus-based statistics-oriented (CBSO) machine translation researches in Taiwan. AMTA (1997), pp. 165--173. Multi-Pass This approach involves serially processing the input multiple times. The most common technique used in multi-pass machine translation systems is to pre- process the input with a rule-based machine translation system. The output of the rule-based pre-processor is passed to a statistical machine translation system, which produces the final output. This technique is used to limit the amount of information a statistical system need consider, significantly reducing the processing power required. It also removes the need for the rule- based system to be a complete translation system for the language, significantly reducing the amount of human effort and labor necessary to build the system.Hovy, E. 1996. Deepening wisdom or compromised principles?-the hybridization of statistical and symbolic MT systems. IEEE Expert, 11 (2), pp. 16--18. Confidence-Based This approach differs from the other hybrid approaches in that in most cases only one translation technology is used. A confidence metric is produced for each translated sentence from which a decision can be made whether to try a secondary translation technology or to proceed with the initial translation output. Omniscien Technologies is one company using this approach, with NMT being the primary technology, but falling back to SMT if the confidence score is below a threshold or the sentence length is very short (i.e. 1 or 2 words). SMT is also used when common error patterns such as multiple repeat words appear in sequence, as is common with NMT when the attention mechanism is confused.

Harry Watts (1894 - December 3, 1940) was a Canadian thoroughbred horse racing jockey. He won the 56th running of Canada's King's Plate race in 1915 on the horse Tartarean. Biography Watts was born in 1894 in Toronto. On May 22, 1915, at Woodbine Racetrack, Watts rode Tartarean to victory for the King's Plate, finishing in 2:09.20. Watts' brother, Richard, was also a professional thoroughbred jockey. After a successful career as a jockey, Watts retired from the sport, and became a butcher. He married Myrtle E McEwan, and together they had three children. The family owned a longstanding butcher shop in Toronto's East York until Watts' death in 1940, in Toronto. He is buried in Toronto's historic St John Norway's Church Cemetery. Harry Watts astride Tartarean after winning the King's Plate in 1915.  Tartarean  Tartarean is described as following in Louis E. Cauz's \\"The Plate, A Royal Tradition\\": > Tartarean was a bay colt by Stanhope II, a grandson of St. Simon, from > Tarletan by Uhlan. He was bred by the Pontiac Stud owned by Lily A. > Livingston, owned by Charles Millar, trained by Jonn Nixon, and ridden by > Harry Watts. Charles Millar came to own Tartarean and stablemate Fair > Montague, who finished second, because of a rule at the time which dictated > that horse owners in Ontario not only had to be residents but had to be > British subjects. Mrs. Livingston, the breeder of both runners, was an > American citizen. She did receive $500 from the OJC as the breeder of the > winner though.  May 22, 1915: The King's Plate race  Watts, trainer Nixon, and Tartaren's owner Millar were all Toronto citizens, racing in their home town for the country's most prestigious horse racing trophy. Their victory was celebrated as a victory for the city of Toronto. A special segment titled \\"King's Plate For Toronto\\" appearing in the New York Times on May 22, 1915 described the \\"classic event\\", and surrounding excitement, as follows: > The King's Plate of 1915, which will go down into Canadian turf history as > one of the best contested events in many years, was a thorough Toronto > victory. [...] Wagering on the plate was unusually heavy, the heaviest, in > fact, for years if the crush and turmoil around the machines was any > indication. Race favourte, Lady Curzon, was a fourth place finisher, out performed by Pepper Sauce in third, Fair Montague in second, and Tartaren in first. While Fair Montague maintained a lead for most of the race, she \\"could not stall off the irresistible challenger of Tartarean, which captured the honours in the final stride.\\" Tartarean's performance during the King's cup race was described as following by Louis E.

Directed by Ray Nazarro and filmed at the Iverson Movie Ranch, the film stars Gary Merrill as a cold blooded secret agent using the war for his own ends. The film features The Lone Ranger television series Jay Silverheels and Clayton Moore in separate roles as well as Richard Webb of Captain Midnight. Plot Over footage from The Man from Colorado, opening titles inform the audience that during the Civil War the Confederate States of America sent agitators to the American West to incite Indian tribes against the Federal Government to draw troops away from battles in the East. In 1864 a stagecoach containing two passengers is attacked by an armed band who kill the driver and stop the stage. One of the passengers, Zachary Paige offers the armed but polite band his money but is surprised when they inform him that they are not interested in his money but know his identity as a diplomatic emissary of President Abraham Lincoln sent to the Dakota Territory to negotiate a treaty with the Sioux than includes payment of $130,000 in gold to the tribe. The band take his credentials and Paige is further surprised when his travelling companion, Brock Marsh tells him he is a secret agent of the Confederacy who will impersonate Paige in his diplomacy but will use the opportunity to break the promises and lure the Sioux into attacking the white settlements. The leader of the band John Lawrence informs Paige he will be held until after Marsh completes his mission then released. As Lawrence goes away Marsh further explains his mission in a courteous manner, then shoots and kills Paige to protect the mission to the surprise of Lawrence and his band. Arriving in the nearest city, Marsh as Paige informs the town authorities of his mission and tells them his stage was attacked by an armed Indian band. Marsh meets \\"Gimpy\\" Joe Woods who offers to take him to the Sioux, but Marsh chooses Daugherty to take him. Before their departure a posse bring in John Lawrence who they have identified as a Confederate agent and seek to lynch him. The lynch mob becomes an impromptu court run by Judge Baker who try Lawrence for treason on the spot and sentence him to hanging. Gimpy implores Marsh as Paige to use his Federal authority to make the case a Federal matter and delay Lawrence's fate to a trial by Federal authorities. Marsh refuses and is hanged in front of his daughter Ruth, who swears vengeance on the town and its population. Gimpy takes Marsh aside and reveals himself as Lawrence's second in command and asks him why he did not save Lawrence with Marsh replying that his mission is more important to the Confederacy. Daugherty informs Marsh that though Chief War Cloud is a reasonable man his son Black Buffalo desires the extermination of all whites. Proving his point, the pair are attacked by a war party led by Black Buffalo where his brother is killed by a proficient pistol shot by Marsh. The pair split up where Daugherty escapes but Marsh is captured. When Marsh realises Black Buffalo is not interested in the peace treaty and will burn him alive the clever Marsh shames the Indians that they are cowards and will be punished in the afterlife for not giving a prisoner a fair and sporting chance for his life. Marsh is pitted against a brave, both armed with knives in a fight to the death that Marsh wins by throwing his knife into the brave's back gaining him time for a rescue by Daugherty's posse. Upon return to the town where Marsh intends to buy drinks for the posse he is called into the office of Judge Baker and Marshal Collins who show him the body of the real Paige who was buried in a shallow grave dug up by coyotes. As he is dressed as an Easterner and not dressed for riding the only possible way he could have come to the area would be as a passenger on the stage that Marsh came in on. Marsh denies he had a travelling companion; as the Marshal and Judge examine the body they find a label in the dead man's jacket with the name of Zachary Paige. As Marsh draws his pistol the pair are shot in the back from an open window by Gimpy armed with a rifle. When the townspeople burst in and see Marsh's weapon unfired they believe Ruth Lawrence is responsible. Gimpy and his band discover the hard way that in addition to starting an Indian uprising, Marsh wants the $130,000 in gold for himself alone.
