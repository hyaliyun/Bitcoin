The song opens like a slow song, with careful playing of the guitar and Tyler's dreamy lyrics. After 22 seconds, it abruptly changes to a hard rocking, bluesy song, complete with a boogie background and two-guitar interplay between Whitford and Joe Perry, with Whitford playing the low notes of the riff on the verse and Perry playing funk chords higher up the neck. Legacy Long after its release, \\"Last Child\\" enjoys regular airplay on rock radio and is regularly rotated into Aerosmith's concert setlist. In concert, it is often Whitford's feature spot, in which Tyler introduces him with something like \\"Brad Whitford, what do you got to show for yourself?\\" or \\"What do you got up your sleeve?\\" Whitford often does a little bit of an intro before playing the opening notes to the song. Although it was often assumed that the guitar solo as heard on the studio recording was played by Joe Perry, it was originally rumored to have been played by an uncited (hired) guitarist. During his appearance as a guest on That Metal Show in 2012, Whitford stated that he actually wrote and performed the solo himself. \\"Last Child\\" has been rereleased on compilations including Aerosmith's Greatest Hits, O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits, and Devil's Got a New Disguise as well as live collections including Live! Bootleg, Classics Live II, and A Little South of Sanity.

It is generally considered to have ended in the 1910s but the exact year is a matter of debate. August Strindberg Strindberg, painted by Richard Bergh, 1906 August Strindberg (1849-1912) was a writer world-famous for his dramas and prose, noted for his exceptional talent and complex intellect.Algulin pp.115-132Gustafson, pp.238-257 In 1879 he published The Red Room (R√∂da Rummet), which brought him immediate fame. The Red Room was a satirical novel that relentlessly attacked the political, the academic, the philosophical and the religious worlds.Algulin pp.115-132Gustafson, pp.238-257 After several harsh disputes, Strindberg left Sweden in 1883. In 1884, he briefly returned to Stockholm to stand trial in a blasphemy case against his collection of short stories Married (Giftas). He was acquitted, but the trial sparked a psychological turmoil that lasted for some 10 years, during which he wrote some of his internationally best known works: the self-examinatory Tj√§nstekvinnans son (1886‚Äì87), En d√•res f√∂rsvarstal (1887-87); and also plays Fadren, Fr√∂ken Julie and M√§ster Olof (1886‚Äì88).Algulin pp.115-132Gustafson, pp.238-257 In 1897 Strindberg engaged himself in occultism, in particular alchemy, leading to a mental breakdown known as his Inferno-crisis. The following year (1897), Strindberg moved back to Sweden and settled in the city Lund. There, he resurrected his literary production by publishing Inferno.Algulin pp.115-132Gustafson, pp.238-257 In 1898, Strindberg moved back to Stockholm. He continued writing but also engaged himself energetically in debates in a wide range of subjects. His most notable writings during this period were his dramas, such as The Dance of Death (1900) and A Dream Play (1901).Algulin pp.115-132Gustafson, pp.238-257  The 90s poets  The Swedish 1890s is noted for its poetic neo-romanticism, a reaction to the socio-realistic literature of the 1880s. The first literary key figure to emerge was Verner von Heidenstam (1859-1940), and his literary debut in 1887 with the collection of poetry Vallfart och vandrings√•r (Pilgrimage and Wander-Years).Algulin, pp.137-140Gustafson, vol2, p.11 Selma Lagerl√∂f (1858-1940) was the arguably brightest star of the 1890s, and her impression has lasted up to modern times. She wrote several highly regarded works which are still among the toplists on Swedish libraries, such as G√∂sta Berlings saga (1891), an epic tale of the unmoral G√∂sta Berling who gets haunted by the Devil, and The Wonderful Adventures of Nils (1906-1907), a geographical adventure of Nils who travels Sweden on the back of a goose. Lagerl√∂f was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909 for the imagination and spiritual perception that characterized her writings.The Nobel Prize in Literature 1909, The Official Web Site of the Nobel Foundation, October 15, 2006Aluglin, pp.158-160 Gustaf Fr√∂ding (1860-1911) was another key figure of the 1890s. His active literary period only spanned between 1891-1898, because of mental problems. Fr√∂ding was above all renowned for his flowing poetry. His popularity was at first based on his bubbling sense of humor and free treatment of the poetic verse; but later readers also found in it a profound humanism and imaginative depth.Gustafson, pp.296-303 Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864-1931) was, like Fr√∂ding, a depictor of rural life in his native province (in Karlfeldt's case, Dalarna). His poetry had the intention of sparking a cultural identity within Dalarna, and spoke warmly of traditions, family values, and so on. Although his poetry was narrow, Karlfeldt was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1931 (posthumously), possibly as a result of internal politics within the Swedish Academy.Gustafson, pp.303-311 image:Gustav Fr√∂ding.jpgFr√∂ding, 1896 Image:Selma Lagerl√∂f.jpgLagerl√∂f, 1909  Notes and references  * Algulin, Ingemar, A History of Swedish Literature, published by the Swedish Institute, 1989. * Gustafson, Alrik, A History of Swedish Literature (2 volumes), 1961. * Swedish Institute, Modern Literature, accessed October 17, 2006 * Tigerstedt, E.N., Svensk litteraturhistoria (Tryckindustri AB, Solna, 1971) Category:Swedish literature Category:Realism (art movement) ","title":"Swedish realism"},{"id":"7699528","text":"Niles West High School, officially Niles Township High School West or NWHS, is a public four-year high school located in Skokie, Illinois, a north suburb of Chicago in the United States.

Built in 1856, it is a prominent local example of high-style Italianate architecture. Since 1904, it has served as the official residence of the president of Wesleyan University. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description The house faces east to the Connecticut River from the southwest corner of High Street and Wyllys Avenue. High Street between Church and Washington Streets was the most prestigious residential area in Middletown during the 19th century, and is now a part of the Wesleyan University campus. It is of a symmetrical cube form with a projecting pavilion, prominent porte cochere, and elaborate scrolled brackets beneath the eaves of the roof and cupola. The treatment of the windows is similarly elaborate with heavy flat pediments supported on consoles. There are elaborate crestings in the window pediments of the front facade. The entrance to the house is distinguished by the porte cochere with paired columns and a balustrade. Significance This house was built in 1856 by Gabriel Coite, on the site of a house formerly owned by gun maker Simeon North. Coite was a partner in his father's business in Brooklyn, New York, until he retired to Middletown in 1853. In 1860 he was elected State Senator; and in 1862 became treasurer of the State and moved to Hartford. In 1863, the house was acquired by Mrs. Jane Miles Hubbard, widow of Samuel D. Hubbard. Hubbard was co-founder of the Russell Manufacturing Company, builder of the Mansion block, and a Postmaster General. Wesleyan University purchased the property from Mrs. Hubbard's heirs in 1904 for use as the President's residence. Since then Presidents Raymond, Shanklin, Olin, McConaughty (later Governor of Connecticut), Butterfield, Etherington, and Campbell have occupied the house. The large scale of this house, together with its elaborate decorative treatment, makes it one of the most sophisticated examples of its style in Middletown. Its site is at the highest elevation on Main Street, and thereby complements the imposing qualities of the architecture.

Biography =Career= Braidotti, who holds Italian and Australian citizenship, was born in Italy and grew up in Australia, where she received degrees from the Australian National University in Canberra in 1977 and was awarded the University Medal in Philosophy and the University Tillyard prize. Braidotti then moved on to do her doctoral work at the Sorbonne, where she received her degree in philosophy in 1981. She has taught at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands since 1988, when she was appointed as the founding professor in women's studies.See Braidotti's CV on her website http://www.rosibraidotti.com/images/cvbraidotti_2013.pdf In 1995 she became the founding Director of the Netherlands research school of Women's Studies, a position she held till 2005. Braidotti is a pioneer in European Women's Studies: she founded the inter-university SOCRATES network NOISE and the Thematic Network for Women's Studies ATHENA, which she directed till 2005. She was a Leverhulme Trust Visiting Professor at Birkbeck College in 2005-6; a Jean Monnet professor at the European University Institute in Florence in 2002-3 and a fellow in the school of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1994. She is a founding member of the European Consortium for Humanities Institutes and Centres (ECHIC), 2008; in 2010 she was elected member of the Board of the Consortium Humanities Centres and Institutes (CHCI) and in 2014 a member of the Scientific Council of the Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique in France. Braidotti was the founding Director of the Centre for the Humanities at Utrecht University (2007-2016), and is currently Distinguished University Professor at Utrecht University. Braidotti serves, or has served, on the advisory board of many academic feminist journals, including differences, Signs, Women's Studies International Forum, and Feminist Formations. =Four publications on subjectivity= Braidotti's publications have consistently been placed in continental philosophy, at the intersection with social and political theory, cultural politics, gender, feminist theory and ethnicity studies. The core of her interdisciplinary work consists of four interconnected monographs on the constitution of contemporary subjectivity, with special emphasis on the concept of difference within the history of European philosophy and political theory. Braidotti's philosophical project investigates how to think difference positively, which means moving beyond the dialectics that both opposes it and thus links it by negation to the notion of sameness. This is evidenced in the philosophical agenda set in her first book Patterns of Dissonance: An Essay on Women in Contemporary French Philosophy, 1991, which gets developed further in the trilogy that follows. In the next book, Nomadic Subjects: Embodiment and Difference in Contemporary Feminist Theory, 1994, the question is formulated in more concrete terms: can gender, ethnic, cultural or European differences be understood outside the straitjacket of hierarchy and binary opposition? Thus the following volume, Metamorphoses: Towards a Materialist Theory of Becoming, 2002, analyses not only gender differences, but also more categorical binary distinctions between self and other, European and foreign, human and non-human (animal/ environmental/ technological others). The conclusion is that a systematic ambivalence structures contemporary cultural representations of the globalised, technologically mediated, ethnically mixed, gender-aware world we now inhabit. The question consequently arises of what it takes to produce adequate cultural and political representations of a fast- changing world and move closer to Spinozian notions of adequate understanding. The ethical dimension of Braidotti's work on difference comes to the fore in the last volume of the trilogy, Transpositions: On Nomadic Ethics, 2006. Here she surveys the different ethical approaches that can be produced by taking difference and diversity as the main point of reference and conclude that there is much to be gained by suspending belief that political participation, moral empathy and social cohesion can only be produced on the basis of the notion of recognition of sameness. Braidotti makes a case for an alternative view on subjectivity, ethics and emancipation and pitches diversity against the postmodernist risk of cultural relativism while also standing against the tenets of liberal individualism. Throughout her work, Braidotti asserts and demonstrates the importance of combining theoretical concerns with a serious commitment to producing socially and politically relevant scholarship that contributes to making a difference in the world. Braidotti's output also included several edited volumes. Her work has been translated in a total of 19 languages and all the main books in at least three languages other than English. =Latest publications= Her most recent book is The Posthuman (Polity Press, 2013). The PosthumanThe Posthuman, Polity Press, 2013 offers both an introduction and major contribution to contemporary debates on the posthuman. As the traditional distinction between the human and its others has blurred, exposing the non-naturalistic structure of the human, The Posthuman starts by exploring the extent to which a post-humanist move displaces the traditional humanistic unity of the subject. Rather than perceiving this situation as a loss of cognitive and moral self-mastery, Braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities. Braidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of post-anthropocentric thought, which encompass not only other species, but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole. Because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives, they result in hybridization, erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species, seeds, plants, animals and bacteria. These dislocations induced by globalized cultures and economies enable a critique of anthropocentrism, but how reliable are they as indicators of a sustainable future? The Posthuman concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities. Braidotti outlines new forms of cosmopolitan neo-humanism that emerge from the spectrum of post-colonial and race studies, as well as gender analysis and environmentalism. The challenge of the posthuman condition consists in seizing the opportunities for new social bonding and community building, while pursuing sustainability and empowerment. In 2011 Braidotti published two new books: the renewed and revised edition of Nomadic Subjects and collection of essays Nomadic Theory. The Portable Rosi Braidotti. The collection provides a core introduction to Braidotti's nomadic theory and its innovative formulations, which engage with Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Luce Irigaray, and a host of political and cultural issues. Arranged thematically, essays begin with such concepts as sexual difference and embodied subjectivity and follow with explorations in technoscience, feminism, postsecular citizenship, and the politics of affirmation. Influenced by philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze and especially French feminist thinker Luce Irigaray, Braidotti has brought postmodern feminism into the Information Age with her considerations of cyberspace, prosthesis, and the materiality of difference. Braidotti also considers how ideas of gender difference can affect our sense of the human/animal and human/machine divides. Braidotti has also pioneered European perspectives in feminist philosophy and practice and has been influential on [third-wave as well as post-secular feminisms].Jusova, I. \\"European Immigration and Continental Feminism: Theories of Rosi Braidotti.\\" Feminist Theory12:1 (Spring 2011) =Honours= On 3 March 2005, Braidotti was honored with a Royal Knighthood from Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands; in August 2006 she received the University Medal from the University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in Poland and she was awarded an Honorary Degree in Philosophy from Helsinki University in May 2007.

Early life and playing career MacFarlane played as a full‚Äìback for Hibernian in the 1950s, when the club featured the forward line known as The Famous Five. He was born in Leith and brought up in the same area (Hutchison) as goalkeeper Tommy Younger, with whom he played for Hutchison Vale and the Army. Both players were then signed for Hibs by manager Hugh Shaw. He was taken by Hibs on a tour of Brazil in 1953 to play in three games in the Maracana stadium against Vasco da Gama, Botafogo and Fluminense. MacFarlane also played for Hibs in the first season of the European Cup, playing in five of the six matches possible. Hibs eventually lost to Stade Reims in the semi-final, where MacFarlane was pitted against Raymond Kopa. Former teammate Tommy Preston described MacFarlane as \\"resolute\\", \\"strong\\" and capable of striking a good free kick. MacFarlane played for Raith Rovers and Morton later in his playing career.  Managerial career and later life  MacFarlane began his managerial career with East of Scotland League club Hawick Royal Albert. He joined Stirling Albion in March 1968, before taking a similar post at Hibernian in 1969. Chairman William Harrower appointed MacFarlane to replace Bob Shankly, who had resigned. Despite suffering early exits in the two cup competitions, Hibs qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by finishing third in the Scottish League. During that first season, MacFarlane's team set a club record for consecutive wins. Hibs beat Malm√∂ and Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es to progress to the third round of the Fairs Cup, where they would lose to Bill Shankly's Liverpool side. That tie with Liverpool led to MacFarlane's departure from Hibs. Chairman Tom Hart, who had just bought the club from Harrower, overruled him on team selection and sacked MacFarlane prior to the match. MacFarlane \\"oversaw the early stages of one of the finest ever Hibernian sides\\". Having signed Erich Schaedler in his previous managerial post at Stirling Albion, MacFarlane made Schaedler his first signing as Hibs manager. He moved John Brownlie from playing in central defence to an attacking full back role, an \\"inspirational\\" choice. Having sold Peter Marinello to Arsenal for a record transfer fee, MacFarlane then signed Falkirk player Johnny Graham, who scored a hat-trick in his first game. He also signed Arthur Duncan, who went on to set the record for most league appearances for Hibs. Former player John Fraser, who worked as a coach for MacFarlane, described him as an \\"enthusiastic\\" manager, who established a good rapport with his players. After leaving Hibs, MacFarlane had a spell as manager of Meadowbank Thistle between 1978 and 1980. MacFarlane also ran a bookmakers business in Edinburgh and regularly attended matches at Easter Road. He was also a keen golf player and karaoke singer. MacFarlane died in hospital on the morning of 11 March 2010, after a \\"short illness\\".

It is effectively the sequel to Complete Arcane. Contents The book provides feats, prestige classes, and other options for characters interested in magic. Unlike Complete Arcane, Complete Mage contains no new core classes, but it contains alternative class features for existing classes. =Advanced class features= Complete Mage adds 13 new alternative class features. Arcane hunter Rangers learn to track and hunt creatures of a certain type when choosing a favored enemy. Some rangers concern themselves less with what a creature is, and more with what it does. These rangers learn to identify signs of the arcane and make it their business to combat those who use arcane magic in opposition to their goals. Arcane stunt Every swashbuckler relies on her agility and quick wit to get her out of scrapes. Some take this a step farther, learning magical tricks that boost their mobility or defense. Armored mage Rare is the fighter who hasn't envied the wizard's bag of magical tricks. Although even the most basic arcane spell remains beyond a fighter's abilities, those who aspire to such talents can, with practice, learn to cast simple arcane spells while wearing light armor. On its own, this alternative feature grants little benefit to a single-classed fighter; only in conjunction with one or more levels of sorcerer, wizard, or a similar arcane spellcasting class does this ability come into play. Curse breaker Most paladins use their divinely granted powers to combat diseases that plague their allies. Paladins with an interest in the arcane particularly those who battle necromancers sometimes prefer to learn to counteract the effects of magical curses. Divine counterspell Although the ability to turn undead is arguably a defining cleric characteristic, some clerics (and paladins) find that they can be even more effective crusaders by opposing evil spellcasters. The ability to negate an enemy spellcasters magic grants a character an unexpected edge. Divine magician Deities influence the world through the divine spells they grant their worshipers. Some clerics, however, choose to explore magical powers beyond those commonly provided by the gods. By giving up some of their divine power, these clerics gain access to spells normally beyond their abilities. Elemental companion Every druid reveres nature, but some pay more respect to the fundamental building blocks of the natural world than to its flora and fauna. By forgoing her bond with the animal kingdom, a druid can instead take on an elemental creature as her companion. Focused specialist Every wizard who calls himself a specialist takes pride in wielding his preferred form of magic. Those who are exceptionally pure of purpose take this specialization to an entirely new level, disdaining breadth of skill in favor of even greater focus. Soulwarp strike The traditional monk seeks balance in body, mind, and soul, and through this equilibrium gains various combat talents. A monk who learns the secret of the soulwarp strike masters an arcane talent of necromancy that infects her enemy's ki, producing an effect akin to terrible sickness. Spell reflection Many masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy. It takes only a little training, however, to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator. Spell sense Most barbarians and rogues have a preternatural awareness of danger, whether the threat of a nearby invisible attacker or the hidden peril of a spear trap. Some, however, fine-tune this ability to focus on magical attacks, granting them the ability to dodge the orbs, rays, and eldritch blasts of their enemies. Spellbreaker song Bards pride themselves on being masters of language and sound. A rare few learn to use their voices to interfere with enemy spellcasters, twisting word and sound to defeat spells before they are cast. Stalwart sorcerer Most sorcerers hide behind walls of steel, slinging spells at enemies safely distant. You have no patience for such cowards and prefer to be near the front line. Your breadth of magical knowledge might not compare with those craven weaklings, but you are proud to dive into the fray alongside the fighter.Williams, Skip; Williams, Penny; Marmell, Ari; Liquette, Kolja Raven; Complete Mage p32-36 (Wizards of the Coast, 2006). Publication history Complete Mage was written by Skip Williams, Penny Williams, Ari Marmell, and Kolja Raven Liquette, and was published in October 2006. Cover art was by Matt Cavotta, and interior art is by Miguel Coimbra, Eric Deschamps, Wayne England, Carl Frank, Randy Gallegos, Ralph Horsley, Jim Nelson, Eric Polak, Mike Schley, Ron Spencer, Anne Stokes, Arnie Swekel, Eva Widermann, and Kieran Yanner. Andy Collins explains how this book relates to Complete Arcane: \\"Both books cover similar topics--how to enhance your character's magical (arcane) abilities. That said, they don't follow exactly the same format (though both contain spells, feats, and prestige classes as one might expect), so the range of subject matter varies a bit. Complete Mage, for example, doesn't introduce new classes like Complete Arcane did, though it does provide some new options (feats, spells, and so on) for the new classes from Complete Arcane.\\" Shannon Appelcline identified Complete Mage as one of the books that \\"changed the way that D&D; worked in dramatic ways\\" and may have influenced the design of 4th edition D&D.; Reception Reviews References External links *Review at d20zines.com Category:2006 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Complete Mage"},{"id":"7699739","text":"Hell Is for Wimps is the second studio album by Christian pop rock band Newsboys.

His treatment while in police custody and the ensuing trials of the arresting officers (all of whom were acquitted) sparked debate concerning police brutality and the responsibilities of arresting officials in handling suspects. This was a widely publicized episode in New York City's history of police brutality cases. Word of the arrest came out on September 15, 1983 as the Committee Against Racially Motivated Police Violence was holding a news conference to publicize a United States Congress hearing into complaints of police abuse. Stewart had been arrested earlier that day. He died at age 25, on September 28, after 13 days in a coma. The cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest. Arrest and death alt=The First Avenue subway station On September 15, 1983, aspiring artist and model Michael Stewart left the Pyramid Club in Manhattan's Lower East Side. He was arrested at 2:50 a.m. for spraying graffiti at the First Avenue station on the Brooklyn-bound platform. Transit Police Officer John Kostick found Stewart scrawling ‚ÄúRQS‚Äù on the wall and had him arrested. Stewart allegedly said, \\"Hey, man, you got me.\\" Kostick cuffed Stewart and walked him to the turnstile to be identified. As Stewart was still living with his parents, he asked the police not to call his home to wake them up. Officer Kostick claimed Stewart was initially cordial, but suddenly ran off and had to be restrained while waiting for the arrest transport van. ‚ÄúAt the top [of the stairs], Stewart fell face-forward on the ground,‚Äù said Kostick. The officer held Stewart to the ground until the van arrived, where several officers put him inside. Stewart was taken to the District 4 Transit Police station at 14th Street‚ÄìUnion Square, two stops away. While being taken to the station, Kostick said, Stewart became ‚Äúvery violent‚Äù in the van. Stewart struggled with the officers and ran to the street. He was beaten unconscious. He was hogtied, bound at the ankles and tethered hands-to-feet by an elastic strap. During the struggle, Stewart's wails could be heard by 27 Parsons School of Design students from their dorm windows. A Parsons student, Rebecca Reiss, heard Stewart say \\"Oh my God, someone help me\\", and \\"What did I do? What did I do?\\". Rob Zombie, also a Parsons student at the time, recounted the incident in 2019 during an appearance on the September 16th episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast (#1353). He stated that he and the other witnesses that night were subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury prior to the trial. Stewart was booked at the Union Square District 4 transit police headquarters for resisting arrest and unlawful possession of marijuana. The transit police supervisors deemed Stewart emotionally disturbed. Stewart was placed back into the van and transported to Bellevue Hospital to undergo psychiatric observation. Stewart arrived at Bellevue at 3:22 a.m. He was handcuffed, his legs were bound, and he was comatose with a blood alcohol content of 0.22, more than double the 0.10 threshold needed to arrest someone for drunk driving. Stewart was dating Suzanne Mallouk at the time.CLEMENT, J. Widow Basquiat In-text: (Clement, 2010) Widow Basquiat. Exeter: Shearsman Books, pp.112-113. She went with Stewart's family to see him at the hospital. According to their account, he had bruises and cuts on his body. The doctors confirmed he was brain dead and had hemorrhaged in a way that suggested he had either been choked or strangled. Stewart died on September 28, 1983, thirteen days after his arrest. Aftermath =Postmortem examination= In charge of determining Stewart's cause of death was the city's medical examiner, Dr. Elliot M. Gross. Gross had three separate findings. He first declared Stewart had died due to excessive drinking, alcohol poisoning, which led to the coma and subsequent heart attack; thus, the police were not at fault. Stewart's family and advocates were unconvinced and believed this was a ‚Äúclassic cover- up.‚Äù In a second autopsy conducted a month later, Gross declared that Stewart had died from a spinal cord injury in the upper neck. In his third assessment he said that Stewart died from blunt-force trauma. According to The New York Times, ‚ÄúGross declined to specify what caused the injury, explaining only that 'there are a number of possibilities as to how an injury of these type can occur.' He refused to talk to press unless testifying before the grand jury.‚Äù Gross said Stewart's injuries, including the facial bruising and the abrasions on his wrists sustained during his arrest, were not said to contribute to his death. Nurses said his hands and face were blue when he arrived at the hospital, and that it took 3 minutes to remove the cuffs. They also said that he had been beaten brutally. Stewart's family doctors contradict what was in the final autopsy report done by Gross. Doctors hired by Stewart's family to perform a secondary autopsy found his cause of death to be strangulation. Dr. Gross said there were no evidence of strangulation. Critical information such as Stewart's eyes were removed and held by Gross and were not allowed to be studied by the doctors hired by Stewart's family. His eyes were crucial because they would have shown evidence of hemorrhaging due to lack of oxygen from being strangled. Gross‚Äô incompetence led the Stewart family to call for a petition to remove him as chief medical examiner claiming alleged wrongdoing and the medical examiners office cannot be trusted with the safekeeping of items. Following the trial, all six policemen were acquitted of criminal charges. Dr. Gross was later fired and Stewart's parents were compensated $1.7 million for their child's death. Stewart's death would be remembered as an egregious tragedy of police abuse. =Grand jury investigation and trials= A grand jury investigation was initiated in October 1983 to determine what happened to Stewart in the 32 minutes between being arrested and his delivery to the hospital. On October 19, about twenty black community leaders, including City Councilwoman Mary Pinkett, protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau‚Äôs office at the Criminal Court Building. Morgenthau refused to see the group stating that it would be inappropriate to comment before the case went to the grand jury in November 1983. The medical examiner‚Äôs final report, issued on November 2, differed from his preliminary report. Gross declined to state explicitly what caused the death, but reported that Stewart died of ‚Äúphysical injury to the spinal cord in the upper neck‚Äù and concluded that there were ‚Äúa number of possibilities as to how an injury of this type can occur‚Äù. During the five-month trial in the New York Supreme Court, some witnesses testified that Stewart was struck and kicked by officers, while other witnesses said they did not see officers beat Stewart. None were able to determine who was responsible for handling Stewart, and none were able to identify which officers took which actions at the arrest. Experts could not agree on what combination of injuries, intoxication, and cardiac health issues ended Stewart's life. Seven months into the grand jury investigation, the case was dismissed because a juror, Ronald P. Fields, initiated private investigations on the case. In February 1984, a second grand jury introduced the case before Justice George F. Roberts which indicted three officers, John Kostick, Anthony Piscola and Henry Boerner, with criminally negligent homicide, assault and perjury. Three other officers, Sgt. Henry Hassler, Sgt. James Barry and Susan Techky, who denied that they saw officers kick Stewart, were charged with perjury. In June 1985, jury selection began in State Supreme Court in Manhattan for the trial. Prosecutor Morgenthau went to the second trial with two theories, one of neck injury leading to the death and the other that beatings caused cardiac arrest. Prosecutors pushed for second degree manslaughter to be charged if it was determined the officers recklessly caused the death. The jury was instructed that to support a charge of criminally negligent homicide, they had to find that the officers failed to take reasonable steps to prevent death. The prosecution hoped to establish a law requiring officers to ‚Äúhave an affirmative duty to protect prisoners in their custody from abuse‚Äù. William McKechnie, of the Transit Patrolman's Benevolent Association, denied the officers' role in the death stating, ‚ÄúIf someone dies of a heart attack, we are not doctors‚Äù. The New York Civil Liberties Union believed the second set of indictments signaled a new direction in how prosecutors treat police abuse cases. Richard Emery a lawyer for the New York City Liberties Union, stated, ‚ÄúThe theory underlining this case is perhaps the most important development in stemming the tide of police abuse. It makes police officers strictly responsible for their prisoners. It holds them accountable.‚Äù On November 24, 1985, the six officers were acquitted by an all-white jury. In 1987, the 11 officers and the MTA were charged with a $40 million civil suit filed by the Stewart family which prompted hundreds of off duty transit police officers to march along Madison Avenue in front of the MTA's headquarters carrying signs reading ‚ÄúEnd the witch hunt‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen are we finally innocent?‚Äù In August 1990, Stewart's parents and his siblings John and Lisha Cole Stewart settled the civil suit out of court for $1.7 million. As of 1990, the police and city officials stated they were not to blame for the death of Michael Stewart. =Reactions= Family - Stewart's family called death an act of racism and brutality. Attorneys representing the Stewart family described Michael as ‚Äúa retiring and almost docile 135-pound young artist and a Pratt Institute student‚Äù who was on his way home to his Clinton Hill, Brooklyn neighborhood where he lived with his mother, Carrie, and father, Millard, who was a retired Metropolitan Transit Authority maintenance worker.http://www.an- mag.com/category/art-is-everywhere/ They maintained that the white officers had beaten a black artist and model. It stirred public protests by black activists and others, believing that city officials are covering up for the transit police. MTA - In March 1987, the MTA determined that only one officer, John Kostick, was subject to suspension based on departmental charges of perjury. The MTA Board approved additional training for transit officers in the handling of emotionally disturbed people and changed its policies on how the department's internal affairs unit becomes involved with cases of possible misconduct.

He was an elder brother of Saint Gall. Life Born in Leinster, Deicolus and his brother, Gall, studied at Bangor Abbey in County Down. He was selected to be one of the twelve followers to accompany St. Columbanus on his missionary journey. After a short stay in Great Britain in 576 he journeyed to Gaul and laboured with St. Columbanus in Austrasia and Burgundy. When St. Columbanus was expelled by Theuderic II, in 610, St. Deicolus, then eighty years of age, determined to follow his master, but was forced, after a short time, to give up the journey, and remained behind alone, establishing a hermitage at a nearby church dedicated to St Martin in a place called Lutre, or Lure, in the Diocese of Besan√ßon, to which he had been directed by a swineherd. Until his death, he became the apostle of this district, where he was given a church and a tract of land by Berthelde, widow of Weifar, the lord of Lure. Soon a noble abbey was erected for his many disciples, and the Rule of St. Columbanus was adopted. Numerous miracles are recorded of St. Deicolus, including the suspension of his cloak on a sunbeam and the taming of wild beasts. Clothaire II, King of Burgundy, recognised the virtues of the saint and considerably enriched the Abbey of Lure, also granting St. Deicolus the manor, woods, fisheries, etc., of the town which had grown around the monastery.Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Saints, Volume I, 1866 Feeling his end approaching, St. Deicolus gave over the government of his abbey to Columbanus, one of his young monks, and retreated to a little oratory where he died on 18 January, about 625.√ì Riain-Raedel, Dagmar. ‚ÄòDeicolus (d. c.625)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Veneration His feast is celebrated on 18 January.

Her colorful character and her care for the sick and dying during the cholera epidemic of 1873 endeared her to the Birmingham community. The shocking true story of the Birmingham Madam The \\"Lou Wooster Public Health Award\\" is named in her honor. Overview Louise Wooster was born in 1842 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama to William Wooster and Mary Chism Wooster. Her father died in 1851 and Mary Wooster remarried. A few years later, Lou's stepfather abandoned the family and took their money with him. Mary Wooster died a few years later virtually destitute. By her middle teens, Lou was an orphan with nothing to rely on but the mercy of relatives. During this time, she was abused, attempted suicide, and her older sister became a prostitute. She later wrote that she \\"fell, step by step, until at last I was beyond redemption\\". In 1873, Lou was a well paid lady of the evening when a deadly cholera epidemic swept through Birmingham. Several thousand people fled the city, but Lou stayed to nurse the sick, feed the hungry, and prepare the dead for funerals. After the epidemic, few of Lou's clients remained in Birmingham and she moved to Montgomery, Alabama to open a brothel. By 1880, she had returned to Birmingham operating multiple brothels near City Hall where she could attract the wealthiest patrons. Lou made a fortune, donated heavily to charities and frequently came to the aid of fallen women. Lou was a master at storytelling and self-promotion. She wrote a book chronicling her life titled Autobiography of a Magdalene.  Death  Lou died in 1913 and was buried in Birmingham's Oak Hill Cemetery. Honors and recognition The Lou Wooster Public Health Award is presented annually by the University of Alabama School of Public Health to recognize individuals, groups, or organizations who are unconventional public health heroes. The award is named in honor of Lou Wooster, the 19th-century Birmingham madam who risked her own death by staying in the city to care for the sick and dying during the 1873 cholera epidemic. Lou Wooster organized the women in her brothel \\"determined to stay and help nurse the poor sick and suffering ones who needed me.\\" Her courage went a long way toward assuring there was a Birmingham for the leadership to come back to. When she died in May 1913, hundreds of empty black carriages drove by the funeral home to pay respects to a local hero. Recipients are driven by a horse-drawn carriage from the School of Public Health to Oak Hill Cemetery where Lou Wooster is buried. The first award was presented in 2007 Representative Patricia Todd, MPA, who is also known as the first openly gay State Representative in Alabama. In 2010 the award was presented to American Electric Power for their efforts to work with environmental groups and other stakeholders to reduce pollution from power production. Master Chef Frant Stitt was recognized in 2011 for his work in improving nutrition by working on urban farms and creating new menus for University Hospital. In 2012 the VF Corporation was recognized for its decision to rebuild the Hackleburg, Alabama Wrangler Distribution Center destroyed by the April 27, 2011 tornado. Rebuilding this facility will have profound impacts on the long-term health of the community. References Further reading * Wooster, L. C. W. (1911) Autobiography of a Magadalen.

At the death of her husband Victor Amadeus I in 1637, she acted as regent of Savoy between 1637 and 1648. Daughter of France Christine was born in the Palais du Louvre in Paris, she was the third child and second daughter of King Henry IV of France and his second wife, the Italian Marie de' Medici. As a daughter of the king, she was a Daughter of France. She was a younger sister of Louis XIII of France and Elisabeth of France. She was also an older sister of Nicholas Henri, Duke of Orl√©ans, Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans and Henrietta Maria of France. Christine was a sister-in-law of Philip IV of Spain through √âlisabeth and of Charles I of England through Henrietta Maria. As a child, she was raised under the supervision of the royal governess Fran√ßoise de Montglat. After the marriage of her older sister Elisabeth in 1615 to the future Philip IV of Spain, Christine took on the honorary title of Madame Royale indicating her status as the eldest and most senior unmarried daughter at the court of her father. After her marriage, the style went to her younger sister Henrietta Maria of France. Princess of Piedmont Christine married Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy, on 10 February 1619 at the Louvre in the capital. From 1619 till her husband's accession, she was known as the Princess of Piedmont. He was a son of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, and Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain. She was said to be volatile and frivolous. Educated at the French court, she introduced French culture to the court of Savoy; she later lived at the Palazzo Madama which she had rebuilt. She was also the driving force for the reconstruction of the Castello del Valentino as well as the additions to the Royal Palace of Turin. She would also later own Vigna di Madama Reale, old residence of her brother in law Maurice of Savoy. She did as much as she could to ensure that her court rivalled in splendour that of her sister Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England. The sisters would have somewhat of a rivalry. In spite of this, the two sisters maintained an avid correspondence throughout their life which showed their close relationship. She was a confidant to the exiled Queen Henrietta who often wrote to her about her experiences during the English Civil War and her son's restoration. Christine encouraged her husband to claim his right to the rather empty title of King of Cyprus and Jerusalem, a 'kingdom' which led to him being tagged as 'a king without a crown'. She did not keep it a secret that she would rather be a queen than a duchess; she also wanted to transform the minor Duchy of Savoy into a little France. Duchess and Regent of Savoy Victor Amadeus became Duke after the death of his father on 26 July 1630. When Christine's husband died in 1637, she was created regent in the name of her son Francis Hyacinth. At the death of Francis Hyacinth in 1638, her second son Charles Emmanuel II succeeded and Christine retained the regency. Both Prince Maurice and his younger brother Prince Thomas of Savoy disputed the power of their sister-in- law and her French entourage. When the first heir Francis Hyacinth died in 1638, both brothers started the Piedmontese Civil War, with Spanish support. The two parties were called \\"principisti\\" (supporters of the Princes) and \\"madamisti\\" (supporters of Madama Reale). After four years of fighting, Christine was victorious, thanks to French military support. Not only did she keep the Duchy for her son, she also prevented France getting too much power in the Duchy. When peace was concluded in 1642, Maurice married his fourteen- year-old niece Louise Christine, abandoning the title of cardinal and asking dispensation from Pope Paul V. Maurice became governor of Nice. Christine of France stayed in firm control of the Duchy of Savoy, until her son could follow in her footsteps; her formal regency ended in 1648, but she remained in charge at his invitation until her death. She lived an uninhibited private life and had relationships with the French Ambassador, Marini, her brother-in- law, Maurizio, and Count Filippo d'Agli√©, a handsome learned and courageous man who remained faithful to her all her life. She encouraged her son Charles Emmanuel to marry her niece Fran√ßoise Madeleine d'Orl√©ans, the youngest surviving daughter of Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans, her youngest brother. They married 3 Apr 1663. Christine died at the Palazzo Madama, Turin on 27 Dec 1663 at the age of 57 and was buried at the Basilica of Sant'Andrea. She had outlived 4 of her seven children. Fran√ßoise Madeleine died in January 1664 and her son later married another cousin, Marie Jeanne of Savoy. Marie Jeanne would give birth to Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia who would later marry another French Princess (and member of the House of Orl√©ans) Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans. 17 years after her death, in 1680, her granddaughter Victoria of Bavaria via her third daughter Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, would marry her older brother's grandson Louis de France known as 'the Fat' and Monseigneur. Christine thus became a direct ancestress of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon via Victoria's second son Philip V of Spain. It was revealed on NBC's Who Do You Think You Are? that one of her descendants is model/actress Brooke Shields. Princess Michael of Kent, born Baroness Marie Christine, is also a descendant by Christine's son, Charles Emmanuel.Princess Michael of Kent.

On 11 May 2009, at the annual Leyton Orient awards dinner, Pires was awarded the inaugural Leyton Orient Community Player of the Year award for his outstanding contributions to the club's community sports programmes and youth schemes. Despite scoring 10 goals in 12 reserve games, Pires was unable to find a regular place in the first team and was released by Orient's manager Russell Slade on 9 May 2010. =Welling United= On 19 July 2010, Pires signed for Conference South side Welling United. He suffered a knee injury on 10 August 2010 prior to the start of the Conference South season and was ruled out for four weeks. He was then ineligible to play for a further two weeks due to the club's transfer embargo. He scored a 30-yard free kick on his long- awaited debut against Woking on 18 September 2010, after coming on as a 75th minute sub. Pires and his teammates narrowly missed out on the play-offs but it was still deemed a successful season as the club had faced a points deduction and a transfer embargo. In total he made 27 appearances scoring nine goals. Pires also won the club's Goal of the Season award for his 30-yard spectacular volley against Bishop's Stortford. In his second season at Welling United, Pires played a key part in the club's run to the Conference South play-off final. In total he played 37 matches scoring 14 goals. He also won goal of the season for the second successive year as well as picking up the Players' player of the year award and being named in the Conference South team of the year. On 25 May 2012, Pires signed for newly promoted Woking on a one- year deal. =Woking= Pires scored his first league goal for Woking on 18 August 2012 in a 3‚Äì1 home win against Barrow also collecting the man of the match award. His next goal came on 15 September against Stockport County at Edgeley Park. The goal proved to be the winner and handed Woking their first away win of the season. Having scored three goals in 15 starts plus 11 substitute appearances and featuring on a sporadic basis for the first team since October, Pires was loaned out to Boreham Wood on 16 January 2013 for a month in a bid to recapture his form from the previous season. He returned to Woking for a couple of games in February before joining Boreham Wood on loan again until the end of the season. On 9 May 2013, Woking decided not to take up the option on his contract and he was released. Pires re-joined Welling United on 14 May 2013 on a one-year deal. =Welling United (second spell)= Pires made his second debut as a late substitute in the opening fixture of the 2013‚Äì14 season in a 2‚Äì1 defeat away against Wrexham. His first goal came against his old side Woking after he powerfully headed home a Joe Healy cross in a 4‚Äì2 away win for the Wings. He fractured his leg in a training ground incident in mid-October and was ruled out for four months. Upon his return from injury he went out on a month's loan to Whitehawk on 1 February to regain match fitness. Having made 73 starts plus 20 substitute appearances and scored 27 goals in his two spells in a Wings shirt, he left by mutual consent on 4 March to join Boreham Wood until the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. =St Albans City= Pires was signed by St. Albans City on 6 June 2014, and scored 2 goals on his debut in the Herts Cuphttp://www.sacfc.co.uk/index.php/the- club/2012-04-10-18-56-53/latest-club-news/2696-loick-pires-becomes-a- saint.html but left the club in December, his contract cancelled by mutual consent.

Opera Mobile was ported to the Windows Mobile operating system in 2003. * Version 6.0 was the initial release. * On June 25, 2003, the first update came in the form of version 6.01, which was a minor update, mainly correcting bugs. * Version 6.10, released on October 27, 2003, introduced several user interface and usability improvements, considerably optimized performance, and slightly improved page rendering. It was also the first version to support proxy servers, WAP pages, and the first one to be released in localized versions for 9 different languages. * On July 13, 2005, almost two years after the previous iteration, version 8.0 was launched. This version was the first to require Symbian OS 7 (previous ones could function in Symbian 6.1). This version introduced the Opera Mobile Accelerator, a technology that used an Opera-run external server to slim-down the pages' content to reduce the traffic to the phones. This was also the first version to support dynamic HTML, and greatly improved compatibility with several web standards. * On November 14, 2005, version 8.5 was introduced.

(1978). The Oxford Dictionary of Saints. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Her relics were translated to Sherborne during the reign of Ethelred the Unready. Nothing further is known with certainty about her life. Juthwara's name is how she is known in Anglo-Saxon. Some have suggested that it is a corruption of the British Aud Wyry (meaning Aud the Virgin),St. Aude Wyry alias St. Juthwara. the name by which she is known in Brittany. However, since Aud Wyry simply means \\"Aud the Virgin\\" (Aud is a Germanic name used in Northern France and not a Celtic name) it is more likely that Aud Wyry is a Breton reinterpretation of her original name. She was said to have been the sister of Paul Aurelian, Sidwell of Exeter and Wulvela but this is debated. Legend The legend of Juthwara is known from John Capgrave's Nova Legenda Angliae, after John of Tynemouth mid-fourteenth century. According to this, she was a pious girl who was the victim of a jealous stepmother. She prayed and fasted often, and frequently gave alms. Upon the death of her father, she began to suffer a pain in her chest. Its source was ascribed to her sorrow and austerities. As a remedy, her stepmother recommended two soft cheeses be applied to her breasts, telling her own son, Bana, that Juthwara was pregnant. Bana felt her underclothes and found them moist, whereupon he immediately struck off her head. A spring of water appeared at the spot. Juthwara then miraculously picked up her head and carried it back to the church. Bana repented of his deed and became a monk, founding a monastery of Gerber (later known as Le Relecq) on a battlefield.Baring-Gould, Sabine & Fisher, John. (1907). The Lives of the British Saints. The Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion.Orme, Nicholas. (1992). Nicholas Roscarrock's Lives of the Saints: Cornwall and Devon. Devon and Cornwall Record Society. Location Juthwara's death took place at Halyngstoka, generally accepted as Halstock in Dorset, where she is known as Juthware, and where local tradition points to a field still called by her name, modernised to 'Judith'. Baring-Gould and Fisher suggested instead Lanteglos-by-Camelford in North Cornwall where the church is now named for Saint Julitta, but may have originally borne Juthwara's name. At Laneast ten miles to the east the church is dedicated to her sisters, but this has apparently arisen by a modern confusion between Laneast and Gulval (also known as Lanestly): at Laneast the dedication in 1436 was to SS. Sativola and Thomas the Martyr, Wolvela does not appear until George Oliver's Monasticon. In July 2012, Halstock's parish church of St Mary had its dedication extended to include Juthware, in recognition of the local tradition. Veneration Juthwara's feast day is 18 November, though A Devon And Cornwall Calendar gives 13 July and refers to other sources as giving 23 December. Juthwara's translation is generally held to be 13 July, although one source gives 6 January. Juthwara's body was translated to Sherborne Abbey in the early eleventh century and her shrine remained a place of pilgrimage there until the Dissolution. An illustration of Juthwara's beheading appears in the Sherborne Missal. Juthwara is depicted in the Great East Window of Sherborne Abbey, and on a number of altar screens in Devon, in company with her sister Sidwell. Her traditional emblem is a round soft cheese and/or a sword. She is depicted as a cephalophore in a late medieval statue in Guizeny, in Brittany.

(Review) It is an insertion reaction in that the methylene group from the diazomethane is inserted into the carbon-chlorine bond of the acid chloride. The Nierenstein reaction Reaction mechanism The reaction proceeds through a diazonium salt intermediate formed by nucleophilic acyl substitution of the chloride with diazomethyl anion. The chloride then displaces the diazo group in an SN2 reaction, with N2 as the leaving group. The Nierenstein reaction mechanism If excess diazomethane is present during the reaction, it can act as a base, abstracting a hydrogen from the diazonium-salt intermediate. The result is a neutral diazoketone, which does not react with the chloride. Instead, the byproduct, diazonium-methyl from the other diazomethane molecule, can be attacked by the chloride to produce chloromethane. The unreactive diazoketone can be re-activated and reacted by treatment with hydrogen chloride to give the normal Nierenstein product. The Nierenstein reaction mechanism In some cases, even limiting the amount of diazomethane gives a reaction process that stalls via the neutral diazoketone pathway, requiring the addition of HCl gas to rescue it.McPhee, W.

His father, Umer Hayat (born January 5, 1958), was born in Pakistan and immigrated to the United States in 1976; he is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Together, they were the subjects of the first terrorism trial in the state of California.Arax, M. (2006).\\"The Agent Who Might Have Saved Hamid Hayat\\". Los Angeles Times Magazine. Retrieved October 30, 2006. Both were alleged to be part of, or associated with, a terrorist sleeper cell. In 2019, a judge recommended that the younger Hayat's conviction be overturned, citing an ineffective legal defense for Hayat who was defended by a lawyer who had never previously served in a criminal case in a federal court. The recommendation also cited a coerced confession obtained by the FBI, which one former agent described as the ‚Äúsorriest confession‚Äù he had ever seen. Terrorism charges and trial In June 2005, Hamid Hayat was arrested and charged with providing material support to terrorists, and of lying about it to FBI agents. The prosecution alleged that Hamid Hayat had spent the better part of two years at an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan, returning in 2005 with an intent to attack civilian targets in the United States. The defense contended that Hayat was in Pakistan to engage an arranged marriage. On April 25, 2006, a jury voted to convict Hamid Hayat of one count of providing material support or resources to terrorists and three counts of making false statements to the FBI in matters related to international or domestic terrorism. The maximum penalty for these charges is 39 years of imprisonment. Sentencing was set for July 14, 2006, before U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. His father, Umer Hayat, was also arrested and charged with two counts of making false statements to the FBI regarding the investigation of his son and of certain members of the Muslim community of Lodi.Scott, M.

Supporters of the Hayats contended that they were both innocent and had been railroaded by overzealous FBI agents and post-9/11 Islamophobia. They cited the occasionally outlandish nature of the confessions, especially the elder Hayat's in particular in which he described a supposed al-Qaeda training camp populated by a thousand men doing \\"pole vault\\" practice in ninja masks (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle masks, according to the Los Angeles Times). Hamid Hayat's attorney, Wazhma Mojaddidi, also claimed that he had been worn down by the FBI's five-hour interrogation and confessed to crimes that he did not commit. Hamid and Umer Hayat's separate videotaped confessions were the linchpin of the government's case. Former FBI agent James Wedick Jr., a veteran of 35 years, believed that the confessions had been coaxed with intimidation and leading questions. Wedick was never allowed to testify and present his analysis of the confession videotapes at Hamid Hayat's original trial.FRONTLINE: the enemy within: interviews: james wedick  PBS Prior to being contacted by defense attorneys for Hamid Hayat, Wedick had had no knowledge of, or involvement with, the case. The government argued that there was a greater pattern at work. A government informant taped the younger Hayat as saying, regarding the murder of Daniel Pearl by Pakistani terrorists, \\"They killed him. So I'm pleased about that. They cut him into pieces and sent him back. That was a good job they did. Now they can't send one Jewish person to Pakistan.\\" FBI agents also recovered from his room jihadist magazines (e.g. of the Jaish-e-Mohammed) and a \\"jihad scrapbook\\" containing articles praising the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. He also carried in his wallet a supposed \\"jihadi supplication\\" reading \\"O Allah we place you at their throats and we seek refuge in you from their evils.\\" Much was made of how Umer Hayat seemed to possess sums of cash unusual for an ice cream truck driver with only an 8th grade education (e.g. a $390,000 home with no outstanding debt).

There is also a tenuous family connection to radical Islam: Umer's father-in-law, Hamid's maternal grandfather, is a prominent leader in the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, a conservative, strictly religious political party in Pakistan strongly associated with the Taliban in Afghanistan.Pipes, D.

Previously, on April 19, 2003, both Hayats had been stopped at Dulles International Airport on the way to Pakistan. They were attempting to illegally carry $28,093 in cash out of the country. According to the defense, this was money that they had saved to build a vacation home in Pakistan and to pay for Hamid's wedding and the wedding of his sister. Motion for a new trial After his initial conviction, Hamid Hayat sought a new trial, for which his attorneys, Wazhma Mojaddidi and Dennis Riordan, filed a motion on the grounds of misconduct by jury foreman Joseph Cote as well as other court misconduct.

Pre-crime  The Hamid Hayat case is seen as an example of a pre-crime conviction (McCulloch and Wilson 2016). The dissenting Judge Tashima in Hayat's unsuccessful appeal argued that he would reverse the conviction \\"because the judicial branch's constitutional duty to do justice in criminal prosecutions was not fulfilled in this case in which the government asked a jury to deprive a man of his liberty largely based on dire, but vague, predictions that the defendant might commit unspecified crimes in the future\\" (United States v Hayat 2013: 4, 59, emphasis in original). Judge Tashima acknowledged that the law permitted conviction on the basis that the defendant might commit such unspecified crimes in the future, but argued that, when the law allows for such convictions, every aspect of the trial should be scrupulously fair, and that Hayat's trial did not meet this standard. The majority likewise described the government's \\"preventative approach\\" as \\"one that permits the conviction of potential terrorists who may never in fact have committed any terrorist act if not arrested and convicted\\" (United States v Hayat 2013: 24). The Confession Tapes In 2019, Hamid Hayat's story was featured in Season 2 of Netflix's documentary series The Confession Tapes in an episode entitled \\"Marching Orders\\".  US Government's Dismissal of All Charges  In February 2019, the U.S. Government dismissed all charges. In a statement, Hayat‚Äôs legal team, led by Riordan and Horgan, said ‚ÄúHamid Hayat, his family, and his counsel appreciate the decision of the federal government today to dismiss the charges against him rather than seeking a retrial. That decision was obviously correct. Two federal judges have concluded that Hamid would not have been found guilty had the powerful evidence of his innocence that won his freedom in 2019 been presented to his jury in 2006. While we are grateful for the dismissal, the fourteen years Hamid spent behind bars on charges of which he was innocent remain a grave miscarriage of justice. They serve as a stark example of how, in the post 9/11 era, the government‚Äôs effort to protect the public from terrorism could and did in this case go terribly wrong. Hamid‚Äôs exoneration is a cause for celebration, but the story of his case is tragedy that must not be repeated.‚Äù In a statement, Hamid Hayat said ‚ÄúWhen (my attorney) Dennis said ‚ÄòHey, congratulations, it‚Äôs over!‚Äô I didn‚Äôt believe it. Honestly, it was like a dream. Thank you to my family, CAIR-Sacramento, my legal team and my supporters for standing by me every step of the way.‚Äù After being locked up for more than 13 years in a Phoenix, Ariz. prison, Hayat was released in August 2019 after an order was filed by U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. on July 30, 2019 to vacate Hayat‚Äôs conviction. Judge Burrell Jr. was the original trial judge in the widely-criticized case that was recently highlighted in an episode of ‚ÄúThe Confession Tapes‚Äù on Netflix.

The representatives from its five founding members (the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia) were divided into three geographical areas: Europe, Asia- Pacific and North America, each of which actively regulates medical devices using their own unique regulatory framework. Founded in 1992, the GHTF was created in ‚Äúan effort to respond to the growing need for international harmonization in the regulation of medical devices.\\"GHTF Homepage The GHTF disbanded late in 2012.GHTF Says Final Goodbyes, Shutters Website Its mission has been taken over by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), a successor organization composed of officials from regulatory agencies‚Äî not industry ‚Äî around the world.IMDRF website The GHTF website is no longer operational. Mission statement As quoted from the GHTF site now (IMDRF), ‚ÄúThe purpose of the GHTF is to encourage the convergence in regulatory practices related to ensuring the safety, effectiveness/performance and quality of medical devices, promoting technological innovation and facilitating international trade, and the primary way in which this is accomplished is via the publication and dissemination of harmonized guidance documents on basic regulatory practices. These documents, which are developed by four different GHTF Study Groups, can then be adopted/implemented by member national regulatory authorities. The GHTF also serves as an information exchange forum through which countries with medical device regulatory systems under development can benefit from the experience of those with existing systems and/or pattern their practices upon those of GHTF Founding Members.‚ÄùGHTF Summary Statement Stated succinctly, the organization aims to standardize medical device regulations around the world by exchange of information. Membership =Founding members= The founding members consist of regulatory authorities or industry members from the EU, the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada because of their well established and high standards in medical device regulations. Members also participate in the steering committee, which can recommend the inclusion of other participants in Study Groups to be a part of all GHTF activities.GHTF Guidelines =Participating members= Participating members consist of representatives from regulatory agencies or medical device trade associations not a part of the founding members. Participating members are to facilitate the adoption of as much of the GHTF's policies in their region/agency as possible within legal parameters. Participating members can also take part in Study Groups as well as other expert working groups. =Liaison bodies= Liaison bodies are public health organizations, international standard-setting bodies or other groups who can contribute to or benefit from participation in GHTF. Liaison Bodies are encouraged to promote GHTF guidelines to their members and incorporate them into their work. Liaison bodies are permitted to nominate observers for GHTF Study Groups and other expert working groups. =Observers= Observers must be nominated by members and approved by the Study Group Chair. The level of participation that an Observer is granted is also decided by the Study Group Chair. Operating structure =Steering committee= The purpose of the Steering Committee is to provide policy and direction for the GHTF. It is responsible for the assignment and oversight of new work items, adopt and monitor GHTF guidance documents and the authorization and promotion of GHTF training events. The Steering Committee members consist of up to 8 members from each of the Founding Members‚Äô regions. Of the 8 members, up to 4 may be from the regulatory sectors and up to 4 from the industry sectors. The Chain and Vice Chair members of the controlling region are not to be included in this number.GHTF Steering Committee =Study groups= There are five study groups in the GHTF, each with a different focus. The size of each Study Group is to be determined by the Study Group Chair. Recommended members include one participant from each region with founding member status as well as appropriate numbers from regulatory agencies and industry technical experts. Study Group 1 Study Group 1 is concerned with the current medical device regulatory systems. From examining the current field, the group isolates the principles suitable for harmonization as well as those that pose a threat to harmonization. The Group also deals with the standardization of pre-market submissions and product labeling. Examples of documents put out by Study Group 1 include Principles of Medical Devices Classification, and Labeling for Medical Devices. Study Group 2 Study Group 2 is concerned with medical device vigilance such as medical device reporting and post market surveillance. The Group is designed to harmonize the data collection and reporting systems of the industry. Examples of documents put out by Study Group 2 include Medical Devices Post Market Surveillance: Content of Field Safety Notices, Manufacturer's Trend Reporting of Adverse Events and National Competent Authority Report Exchange Criteria including reference to the use of the GMDN. Study Group 3 Study Group 3 is concerned with examining and harmonizing current quality systems requirements. Examples of documents put out by Study Group 3 include Implementation of Risk Management Principles and Activities Within a Quality Management System and Quality Management Systems - Process Validation Guidance. Study Group 4 Study Group 4 is concerned with examining current quality systems auditing practices and the harmonization of the auditing process. Examples of documents put out by Study Group 4 include Training Requirements for Auditors and Guidelines for Regulatory Auditing of Quality Management. Study Group 5 Study Group 5 is concerned with the convergence of clinical practices. This includes the harmonization of clinical terms, reports and evaluations. Study Group 5 has yet to produce any final documents, but areas of proposed topics include Clinical Evaluation and Clinical Evidence. =Study Group Chair= The Study Group Chair member is appointed for a three-year term by the Steering Committee. Upon completion of the term, the Chair is re-evaluated by the Steering Committee based on the needs of the Study Group. The support of a Vice Chair member usually consists of a member from the industry in a different region from the Chair.

The first workers strike, in West Virginia, was the Cabin Creek and Paint Creek strike of 1912-1913.Wheeler, H. N.. (1976). Mountaineer Mine Wars: An Analysis of the West Virginia Mine Wars of 1912-1913 and 1920-1921. The Business History Review, 50(1), 69‚Äì91. With help from Mary \\"Mother Jones\\" Harris Jones, an important figure in unionizing the mine workers, the miners demanded better pay, better work conditions, the right to trade where they pleased (ending the practice of forcing miners to buy from company-owned stores), and recognition of the United Mine Workers (UMW).Blizzard, W. C., & Harris, W. (2010). When Miners March. Oakland, Calif: PM Press. The mining companies refused to meet the demands of the workers and instead hired Baldwin-Felts agents equipped with high-powered rifles to guard the mines and act as strikebreakers. After the Agents arrived, the miners either moved out or were evicted from the houses they had been renting from the coal companies, and moved into coal camps that were being supported by the Union. Approximately 35,000 people lived in these coal camps. A month after the strike began, hostilities began with the arrival of the Baldwin-Felts Agents who provoked the miners. Socialist Party activists began supplying miners with weapons: 6 machine guns, 1,000 high-powered rifles, and 50,000 rounds of ammunition. On September 1, 1912, approximately 6,000 unionized miners from across the Kanawha River crossed the river and declared their intent to kill the mine guards and destroy the company operations. Due to this threat, the mining companies deployed additional armed guards and awaited the miners' attack. Consequently, the Governor proclaimed martial law to be in effect on September 2, 1912, seizing 1,872 high-powered rifles, 556 pistols, 6 machine guns, 225,000 rounds of ammunition, and 480 blackjacks - as well as large quantities of daggers, bayonets, and brass knuckles. On May 19, 1920, a shootout in Matewan, West Virginia, between agents of the Baldwin-Felts and local miners, who later joined the United Mine Workers of America, sparked what became known as the Battle of Blair Mountain, the largest insurrection in the United States since the American Civil War.  Background  = Coal mining in West Virginia = West Virginia had only a few active coal mines during the US Civil War, with fewer than 1,600 miners in the whole state. Coal mining would flourish, however, between 1880 and 1900, after competing railroad companies began carving routes through the mountains of Appalachia. West Virginia produced 489,000 tons of coal in 1869, 4,882,000 tons of coal in 1889, and 89,384,000 tons of coal in 1917. The quick expansion of mining in West Virginia prompted many mining companies to construct company towns, in which mining companies own many, if not all housing, amenities, and public services. Miners were often paid in \\"coal scrip\\", paper notes issued by mining companies that could only be redeemed at company-owned stores in company towns. Mining is a dangerous profession overall, but between 1890 and 1912, West Virginia mines had the highest miner death rates in the country. During World War I, West Virginia miners faced higher death rates than even soldiers in the American Expeditionary Force fighting in Europe.  Mining unions in West Virginia  Some West Virginian coal miners joined the United Mine Workers (UMW) in response to wage reductions following The Panic of 1893. By 1902, UMW membership in West Virginia had reached 5,000 miners. Union membership among West Virginia coal miners remained low, however, especially in southern parts of the state.  Cabin Creek and Paint Creek strikes: 1912-1913  UMW had a strong, if isolated, presence in the Paint Creek area, and most miners there were unionized. In March 1912, Paint Creek UMW miners attempted to renegotiate their contracts for higher pay and automatic union dues. In response, a number of Paint Creek mines withdrew their recognition of UMW. On April 18, 1912, union and non-union miners from Paint Creek, as well as 7,500 miners from the previously non-union Cabin Creek, Kanawha, and Fayette counties, went on strike. The UMW set up tent camps for miners and their families who had often been evicted without warning. UMW Vice-President Frank Hayes and the well- known labor activist Mary \\"Mother\\" Jones even visited the state to pledge their support. Mining companies in the Paint Creek area hired strikebreakers and armed guards to suppress the strike, including 300 agents from the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency. Striking miners and their families were prohibited from using company bridges and roads, as well as utilities like running water. Company guards killed several miners over the first few months of the strike, and constructed a machine gun equipped armored train known as the \\"Bull Moose Special\\", which they used to fire upon the tent camps of striking workers. Miners, with the support of Mother Jones and the Socialist Party of America, acquired weapons and retaliated against the mining company guards. In September, 1912, West Virginia Governor William E. Glasscock declared martial law and sent 1,200 state troops to confiscate weapons and ammunition attempted to quell the rising tensions between miners and mining companies. The declaration of martial law reduced armed conflict in the winter of 1912-1913. In April, 1913, UMW officials presented the Paint Creek mining companies with a compromise deal, leaving out some miner demands but maintaining support for a 9-hour workday, accountability for miner compensation, and protection from backlash for union membership. After nearly a full year of work stoppages and fighting, the mining companies accepted the UMW compromise, which was enforced by West Virginia state soldiers.  1920-1922  = The Battle of Matewan = On April 22 and 23, 1920, between 275 and 300 miners in Matewan, Mingo County joined the United Mine Workers of America. In retaliation, the Burnwell Coal and Coke Company fired all union- aligned miners and gave them three days to leave their company-owned residences. On April 27, 1920, Mingo County officials arrested Baldwin-Felts agent Albert C. Felts, who would later be involved in the Matewan shootout, for illegally evicting miners of the Burnwell Coal and Coke Company as punishment for union activity. Mingo County Sheriff G. T. Blankenship negotiated with miners groups that as long as only Mingo County officials enforced the eviction notices, the miners would peacefully comply. Miners in Mingo County continued to join the UMWA. A May 6, 1920 United Mine Workers meeting drew 3,000 attendees. By May 17, 1920, the UMWA set up a tent colony for evicted miners outside of Matewan. On May 19, 1920, thirteen agents of the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency returned to Matewan to evict miners from Stone Mountain Coal Corporation housing. The Baldwin-Felts agents were challenged by Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield and Matewan Mayor Cabel Testerman, who contested the agents' authority in the town. The Baldwin-Felts agents persisted, however, based on permission from a local justice of the peace. Baldwin-Felts agents carried out their evictions under watch of a crowd of miners and their families. Hearing of the trouble stirring in Matawen, miners from surrounding areas armed themselves and made their way to the town in case of a larger conflict. As the Baldwin-Felts agents were headed to the train station to depart Matewan, they were confronted once more by Police Chief Sid Hatfield and Mayor Cabel Testerman. Both Hatfield and Baldwin-Felts agent Albert Felts reported that they had warrants for the others arrest. Accounts of the May 19th shootout itself differ. Some reports indicate that Baldwin- Felts agents attempted to arrest Sid Hatfield, and shot Mayor Testermen when he intervened on Hatfield's behalf. Others indicate that Hatfield initiated the violence, either by firing himself or by signalling a prepared ambush. In either case, the shootout resulted in ten dead: Mayor Testerman, two miners, and seven Baldwin-Felts agents, including Baldwin-Felts Agency Chief Thomas Felts' younger brothers, Albert and Lee. = After the Battle of Matewan = Support for unionization in Mingo County increased after the Matewan Shootout. By July 1, 1920, in the county had unionized and joined the UMW strike. Miners and mine guards engaged in several armed skirmishes over the closure of coal mines and access to rail routes in the summer and fall of 1920. The West Virginia government declared martial law and sent federal troops to quell the strike, but backed down under threat of a general strike of all union coal miners in West Virginia. Baldwin-Felts Agency Chief Thomas Felts hired a team of lawyers to prosecute a case against Sid Hatfield and fifteen other men alleged to have participated in the Matewan Shootout, specifically on the charge of murdering Albert Felts. All sixteen men were, however, acquitted by a Mingo County jury. Shortly thereafter, the West Virginia State Legislature passed a bill allowing criminal cases to be prosecuted with juries summoned from another county. Murder charges were renewed, only this time for the deaths of the other 6 Baldwin-Felts agents. Sid Hatfield and his deputy Ed Chambers were also brought up on charges of destroying the Mohawk mining camp in McDowell County. On August 1, 1921, Hatfield, Chambers, and their wives traveled unarmed to the McDowell County courthouse to stand trial. Upon reaching the courthouse, Hatfield and Chambers were shot and killed by waiting Baldwin-Felts agents. Miners in West Virginia were outraged at the deaths of Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers. In the weeks following the August 1st assassinations, miners organized and armed themselves across West Virginia. = Battle of Blair Mountain = From August 20, 1921, miners began rallying at Lens Creek, approximately ten miles south of West Virginia state capital of Charleston. Estimates of total numbers vary, but on August 24, between 5,000 and 20,000 miners began marching from Lens Creek into Logan County, West Virginia. Many of the miners were armed, and some acquired weapons and ammo from the towns along the march's path. Logan County Sheriff Don Chafin had assembled a fighting force of approximately 2,000 county police, state police, state militia, and Baldwin-Felts agents to stop the approaching miners in the mountain range surrounding Logan County. On August 25, the miners began arriving in the mountains surrounding Logan, and fighting began between the two forces. Though Sheriff Chafin commanded fewer men, they were equipped with machine guns and rented aircraft, from which they dropped rudimentary bombs on the attacking miners. On August 30, 1921, President Warren G. Harding declared martial law for the entire state of West Virginia and 2,500 federal troops arrived on September 2, bringing with them machine guns and military aircraft armed with surplus explosive and gas bombs from the recently concluded World War I. Facing a large and well equipped fighting force, the miners were forced to stand down. Though the battle ended in clear defeat for the pro-union miners, they gained some press support in the following years. Approximately 550 miners and labor activists were convicted of murder, insurrection, and treason for their participation in the march from Lens Creek to Logan County and the ensuing Battle of Blair Mountain.

Peter Mermier under the patronage of St. Francis de Sales. The political disturbances in the country, especially the French Revolution had its impact in the spiritual realm too as it left the people in a deep spiritual crisis and indifference towards their religious duties. Sensing the signs of the time Fr. Mermier took upon himself the task of a spiritual renewal in his people by preaching parish missions. This special apostolate in turn gave rise to a community of preachers gathered around Fr. Mermier. History It was founded in response to the desire of St. Francis de Sales to found a society of missionary priests. Nearly two centuries after the saint's death, Monsignor Joseph Rey, a successor of the Saint in the See of Annecy, broached the subject of such a society to Father Peter Mermier, who had been considering the same idea. Accordingly, Father Mermier put the design into execution. In 1830 the institute was formed with La Feuillette as the site for the mother- house. This was solemnly blessed by the bishop on 8 August 1837, and the congregation canonically instituted by him on 8 October 1838. The society was not to be a mere association of priests, but a new religious congregation, bound by simple vows. Hence Father Mermier, the first superior-general, offered himself and his companions to the Pope for foreign missions. In 1845 his offer was accepted by Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and the first missionaries of St. Francis de Sales set out for India. The work has prospered and since that time more than 100 priests and seminarians have been sent out by the congregation, besides many lay brothers. More than 200 nuns of different orders have gone out at the call of the missionaries to help them. The first batch of the Fransalians (MSFS) landed in Pondichery on 8 September 1845 and the first batch of the Fransalians reached Visakhapatnam on 19 February 1846. The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples entrusted the Vicariate of Visakhapatnam to the Fransalians on 2 May 1848. Until 1888 there was only one region of the Fransalians in India: Visakhapatnam Region. In 1888 Nagpur region was created by bifurcating the Visakhapatnam region. Both were raised to the status of province in 1965. The dioceses of Nagpur and Visakhapatnam have always been governed by prelates belonging to this institute. In Visakhapatnam the first vicar apostolic was Mgr Neyret (1850); he was succeeded by Mgr Tissot, first bishop of the diocese. The first bishop of Nagpur was Mgr Riccaz; after him came Mgr. Pelvat, a great supporter of the Indian way of religious life and Indian Theology developed by Brahmabandhab Upadyay (1861 -1907), followed by Mgrs. Crochet, Bonaventure, and Coppel. The Fransalians in France and Switzerland were directly under the Superior General until 1959. It became a region in 1960 and a province in 1965. The Fransalians went to England in 1861. England became a region of the Fransalians in 1940 and a province in 1965. In England the fathers have three missions in the Diocese of Clifton. Since the persecution of 1903, the congregation has been obliged to leave Savoy for England, where the juvenate, the novitiate, and the house of studies are successfully carried on. The mission in Brazil was begun in 1926. The Province of Brazil was established in 1965. In 1975 the Fransalians of the Visakhapatnam Province entered the North-East India for evangelization. In 1984 the vice-province of NE India was erected and later in 1990 it was raised to the status of a province. Following the original vision of the Founder, the Servant of God, Fr Mermier, the Fransalians entered the African Continent in 1988. The mission began in Tanzania and the Province of East-Africa comprising Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, in 1996. An autonomous American Mission in the US was founded in 1990 and later raised to the Status of a Region under the Superior General on 3 July 2007. The South-West India Province was established in 1991 bifurcating the Visakhapatnam Province. The Visakhapatnam Province was further bifurcated to form the Tamil Nadu - Pondichery region under the Visakhapatnam Province on 24 January 2005. Three years later this region was raised to the status of a Province with a new name, Chennai Province on 24 January 2008 and in the same year on 15 August 2008, it was renamed as South-East Province. The Nagpur Province which was established in 1965 was later renamed Maharashtra-Goa Province. It was bifurcated in 1996 and the present Nagpur and Pune provinces were erected. The superiors-general since the foundation have been the Very Reverend Fathers Mermier, Gaiddon, Clavel, Tissot, Gojon, and Bouvard.

Within the tradition, the Swedish ballad tradition has been particularly influential, but the tradition also exists in the other Scandinavian countries. This visa tradition should not be confused with traditional \\"medieval\\" Swedish ballads (medeltida ballader), which are representative of a typical tradition of Scandinavian ballads. Tradition The Scandinavian ballad tradition today is both a respected art form and an important basis of the popular Scandinavian sing-along tradition. The song type is typically known as visa in Swedish or vise in Norwegian, and troubadours in the genre are called viss√•ngare in Swedish or visesanger in Norwegian. In context, the Swedish word \\"ballad\\" is a subtype of \\"visa\\" that tells a story in many verses, similar to the medieval ballads, as opposed to for instance lyrical songs about the beauty of nature. The Swedish ballads can be performed to a big orchestra but are often sung to fairly simple accompaniment on guitar, or other instruments such as piano or accordion. Evert Taube The genre started with Carl Michael Bellman in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, poetic songwriting fell into decline in favour of academic student choirs, until it was revived in the 1890s by Sven Scholander. Poets increasingly continued the tradition of having their poetry put to music to give it a wider audience. In the early 1900s, a lot of poetry of the 90s poets Gustaf Fr√∂ding and Erik Axel Karlfeldt had been put to music, and the popularity of those poets largely depended on the troubadours. Birger Sj√∂berg (1885-1929) was one of the early popular troubadours. Sj√∂berg published the poetry collection Frida's Book (Fridas bok, 1922), a light and humorous story of the young Frida. In 1926, he reinvented himself with Kriser och kransar (Crises and garlands), a much darker collection of poetry. It is regarded as the foremost collection of Swedish poetry of the 1920s.Tradition i f√∂rvandling, Palm A., p.44, in Delblanc, L√∂nnroth & Gustavsson (ed.), vol 3. One of the most renowned Swedish troubadours of the 20th century was Evert Taube (1890-1976). He established himself as a performing artist in 1920 and toured Sweden for about three decades. He is best known for songs about sailors, ballads about Argentina, and songs about the Swedish countryside.N√∂jets estrad√∂rer, L√∂nnroth L., in L√∂nnroth, Delblanc & G√∂ransson (ed.), vol 3, pp.275-297 Ole Paus A poet who is known for songs is Nils Ferlin (1898-1961) who published six collection of poetry between 1930 and 1957. Ferlin melancholic but with a stinging irony, and very rhythmical which made them easy for friends and colleagues to put music to. The titles of some of the poems already from the start referred to them being sung as songs, such as \\"En valsmelodi\\" (which translates as \\"A waltz tune\\"), and the title of his first collection of poems, \\"En d√∂ddansares visor\\". Other well-known singer- songwriters in the Swedish ballad tradition after Evert Taube were Olle Adolphson (1934‚Äì2004) and Cornelis Vreeswijk (1937-1987). Vreeswijk's songs were initially leftist protest songs where he took upon himself to speak for the weaker men of society. After his death, Vreeswijk also gained appreciation for his poetic qualities. A Swedish contemporary troubadour is Lars Winnerb√§ck, whose folk-rock ballads, often infused with a poetic quality, mix a Christian socialist political message with a typically Swedish sensitivity to nature in the spirit of Vreeswijk, making him one of Sweden's most popular currently active musicians. The contemporary Norwegian ballad tradition, known as the \\"ballad wave\\" (), started as a cultural movement in the 1960s, greatly inspired by the Swedish ballad tradition and its modern representatives such as Olle Adolphson and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Some of its prominent representatives are Ole Paus, Lillebj√∏rn Nilsen and Finn Kalvik; Alf Pr√∏ysen was also called a visesanger, and influenced but in many ways preceded the Norwegian \\"ballad wave.\\"  Notes and references   Literature  * L√∂nnroth, L., Delblanc S., G√∂ransson, S.

The Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel stood on the site before the casino was built. It is famous for its address of \\"Park Place and the Boardwalk\\", two locations popularized by the board game Monopoly. Bally's is one of the largest hotels on the boardwalk with nearly 1,169 rooms. Its Dennis Tower opened in 1921. In 1997, The Wild Wild West Casino was opened as an expansion of Bally's. History =Bally's Park Place (1979‚Äì2000)= In 1977, Reese Palley and local attorney and businessman Martin Blatt bought the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel and planned to preserve the Blenheim half of the hotel, along with adjacent Dennis Hotel for his Park Place Casino. Palley was successful in getting the Blenheim part of the hotel placed on the National Register of Historic Buildings, while planning to raze the Marlborough to make way for a new modern hotel. However, he stepped aside after Bally Manufacturing purchased a controlling interest in the project. After Bally took control, it announced plans to raze the Marlborough, Blenheim, and the adjacent Dennis Hotel, despite protests, to make way for the new \\"Bally's Park Place Casino and Hotel\\". However, in an effort to offset costs and open the casino as soon as possible, the Dennis Hotel was retained to serve as the temporary hotel for Bally's until a new tower could be built. In November 1978, Bally's demolished the Marlborough-Blenheim and quickly cleared the land to begin building the Bally's Park Place Casino. On December 30, 1979, the casino opened with the newly renovated Dennis serving as its hotel. In 1989, Bally's constructed a 750-room hotel tower in a modern style, with an exterior of light pink glass. On July 2, 1997, The Wild Wild West Casino opened as the second casino at Bally's. The boardwalk entrance to Bally's Casino. =Bally's Atlantic City (2000‚Äìpresent)= In 2000, Bally's Park Place changed its name and became Bally's Atlantic City. The adjacent Claridge Hotel and Casino was purchased and incorporated into Bally's in 2003, and was renamed the Claridge Tower. The casino in the Claridge Tower was named The Ridge. The casino was renovated in 2008 from a standard casino floor to an upscale lounge-casino. In 2005, Harrah's Entertainment (now Caesars Entertainment Corporation) purchased Bally's along with Caesars. The boardwalk side of Bally's was renovated in 2009. The facade of the Dennis Tower was refurbished and a row of shops between the Dennis Hotel and the boardwalk was demolished, which opened the plaza of the Dennis Tower to the boardwalk. In 2012, The Ridge closed its gambling and food amenities. The tower's 500 hotel rooms continued to be used for Bally's guests until it was sold in 2013 to be reopened as the independent Claridge Hotel. In October 2017, ownership of Bally's was transferred to Vici Properties as part of a corporate spin-off, and the property was leased back to Caesars Entertainment. In April 2020, Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Vici Properties, and Caesars Entertainment announced that Twin River would be acquiring assets of Bally's Atlantic City. However, the deal excludes the Wild Wild West casino which contains \\"The Book\\" sports betting facility, which would be transferred to Caesars Atlantic City. Twin River also announced that they will acquire a license to give Bally's their own sports book, online sports betting, I-Gaming. Gaming The two casinos at Bally's have over . of gaming space with over 5000 slot machines, Keno, and many table games, among other features. Recent developments include games which combine the features of live table games with those of slot machines: The multi-player Roulette automatically spins the ball, but the bet and payout function is mostly handle by computerized video terminals for each player. Also, in the Wild Wild West area, a video recorded \\"blackjack dealer\\" on a big TV screen \\"deals\\" as the player bet on a video terminal which shows their \\"cards\\" in a multi-player game. Bally's also has a sportsbook which offers sports betting. As provided by local and state law, there scattered areas where smoking is permitted, totaling 25% of the official gaming space. (Aside from this exception, smoking is banned by law throughout the rest of the casino and hotel). Under New Jersey law, persons under 21 years of age are not permitted to gamble. They may only pass through the main aisles of the casino when accompanied by someone over 21 years old to cross between hotel areas and exits, and may not stop or slow down to observe the games. Bally's Atlantic City participates along with other Caesars Entertainment properties in the \\"Caesars Rewards\\" loyalty program for their players, guests, and other customers. Rewards are based on casino play, food/beverage/retail/hotel room/entertainment purchases, and other factors. There are four tiers of membership, increasing in status: Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Seven Star. =The Wild Wild West Casino= right The Wild Wild West Casino from the boardwalk. Opened on July 2, 1997, as an expansion of Bally's Atlantic City, it was originally extensively themed to the American Old West, with waterfalls, faux gold mines, and a running stream. It is notable for being one of the only fully themed casinos on the East Coast. The exterior features a facade made to resemble an old western town, while the inside featured a large mountain and other western town facades. The western theme has since been toned down in favor of a party atmosphere in order to attract a younger demographic. Renovations to the Wild Wild West Casino began in June 2012 and were completed on February 21, 2014. The Virginia City Buffet was closed, and the casino floor area was reduced in size; for a period of time in 2012, all live table games and most slot machines were removed. Table games returned to the casino with the completion of renovations, occupying the newly renovated back area. A World Series of Poker-branded poker room allows simultaneous live and online play. A new stage for live entertainment was also part of the renovations. Further renovations occurred in 2015 and 2016. The animatronic gold miner and large rock formation/waterfall near the main boardwalk entrance were removed; this space now features a large area for bands to perform, as well as some live table games. The only slot machines besides those in Coyote Kate's Slot Parlor are located near the new stage. The area between the stage and the far back poker rooms remains vacant, but plans may still be in the works for more to be added. On President's Day weekend 2016, Bally's opened the new Boardwalk Saloon. The bar offers ceiling to floor windows with views of the boardwalk and beach and an entrance with accordion folding glass doors which can remain open for access to outdoor seating on the Boardwalk.

originating print syndication. Biography He was born in Wallingford, Connecticut. His father was a plain farmer, and gave him an ordinary education. He early showed a mechanical aptitude, and at 14 was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. Before his term was up, he purchased his freedom and established a cabinet making business in Northampton, Massachusetts. The business failed, and he moved to Springfield. There he endeavored to manufacture a gunpowder engine for propelling balloons; but this enterprise was also a failure. He next attempted to open steam navigation on Connecticut river between Hartford and Springfield, and would have succeeded if financial difficulties had not obliged him to cease operations before his steamer was completed. He then invented a rag-cutting machine for paper mills. The invention was widely used, but Beach derived no pecuniary benefit due to his tardiness in applying for a patent. He then settled in Ulster County, New York, where he invested in an extensive paper mill. At first he was successful, and after six years was wealthy; but after seven years an imprudent investment dispersed his fortune, and he was compelled to abandon his enterprise. In the meantime though, he had married the sister of the founder and proprietor of the New York Sun, Benjamin Day. In 1835, he acquired an interest in the paper, then small, both in the size of its sheet and circulation. And with a $40,000 payment, he soon became sole proprietor. According to historian Elmo Scott Watson, Beach invented print syndication in 1841 when he produced a two-page supplement and sold it to a score of newspapers in the U.S. northeast.Watson, Elmo Scott. \\"CHAPTER VIII: Recent Developments in Syndicate History 1921-1935,\\" 'History of Newspaper Syndicates. Archived at Stripper's Guide. The Associated Press was organized in May 1846 by Beach (at that time publisher of The Sun), joined by the New York Herald, the New York Courier and Enquirer, The Journal of Commerce, and the New York Evening Express. The AP was formed by the five New York daily papers to share the cost of transmitting news of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. During the War, U.S. President James K. Polk sent Beach to Mexico to arrange a treaty of peace; but the negotiations were broken off by a false report announcing the defeat of General Zachary Taylor by Mexican General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Beach retired in 1857 with an ample fortune, and left the paper to his sons. He then returned to Wallingford.  Personal life  Beach was married twice and left five sons, Moses Sperry, Henry, Alfred Ely, Joseph and William, and one granddaughter, Emmeline, who married the naturalist and artist Abbott Handerson Thayer. She was the daughter of Moses Sperry Beach. She and her father are described in Mark Twain's The Innocents Abroad.

It is also a parish in the N√§tra Court District. History Sidensj√∂ Church In 1915 the parish comprised 39,416 hectares. By that time Sidensj√∂ was a church district in the Diocese of H√§rn√∂sand and the northwest deanery of √Öngermanland. The parish of Sidensj√∂ today includes 33 smaller villages and covers an area of 389 square kilometres. On January 1, 1952 a joint municipality was formed from the parishes of Sidensj√∂ and N√§tra. It was called N√§tra municipality and was included into the √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik municipality in 1971. Sidensj√∂ is situated by Lake Bysj√∂n, 23 kilometres west of √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik in √Öngermanland. Sidensj√∂ houses 1,191 inhabitants (2004). At the beginning of the 1900s the number of inhabitants was as high as 2500. In the centre of Sidensj√∂ are Sidensj√∂skolan (grades 1-6 and preschool), Sidensj√∂ Sparbank (a free-standing Swedbank bank), a grocery store, an outdoor ice hockey rink, the Sidensj√∂ IK football pitches and the service house Fyrkl√∂vern with an old people‚Äôs home and nursery school. Among the things worth seeing is the Sidensj√∂ church, which was built in the 14th century and with that is one of the oldest in the √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik municipality. The church foundation was renovated in the early 1900s and many skeletons were uncovered below the church floor. Among the people buried was an embalmed 19th century priest and in the sacristy a young woman was found. Just southeast of the church along road 908 towards Bj√§sta is the Sidensj√∂ Village Hall where a caf√© is open during summer. Next to the church is a hydroelectric power station that extracts energy from the N√§tra√•n, a river with countless bends and sandbanks that is a popular place for canoe paddling. A popular tourist attraction is the ‚ÄúBywatch‚Äù beach on the eastern shore of lake Bysj√∂n along road 935 towards √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik, where there is a bridge, volleyball net and during summer a swim school. Sidensj√∂ has many active organizations and the biggest ones are IOGT-NTO (Swedish temperance organisation) and Sidensj√∂ IK. Sidensj√∂ IK is divided into several sections where the biggest ones are orienteering, cross-country skiing and football. In 1994 Sidensj√∂ IK was responsible for organizing the first leg of the great orienteering competition called 'O-ringen 5-dagars'. The club was also the organizer of ‚ÄòNatt-SM in orienteering‚Äô in 2004. During the 1980s Sidensj√∂ had a women's football team participating in the Damallsvenskan national football league. The men‚Äôs team is, as of season 2007/2008, residing in Division 5. Youth activity has always been an important and major part in the club and this work has produced a number of players who now play in Division 2 Norrland. In November 2003 Skanova installed ADSL in the Sidensj√∂ telephone switch and is now available to most inhabitants through various ISPs.

It is native to sub-Saharan Africa but has been introduced to many other regions of the world and now has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km2. It is popular and easy to keep in captivity. Description It is a small bird, 4 to 5 inches in length with a wingspan of 4 1/2 inches and a weight of 3/5 to 3/4 ounce. It has a slender body with short rounded wings and a long graduated tail. The bright red bill of the adult is the colour of sealing wax giving the bird its name.Soanes, Catherine & Stevenson, Angus (eds.) (2005) Oxford Dictionary of English, Oxford University Press, Oxford. The plumage is mostly grey-brown, finely barred with dark brown. There is a red stripe through the eye and the cheeks and throat are whitish. There is often a pinkish flush to the underparts and a reddish stripe along the centre of the belly depending on the subspecies. The rump is brown and the tail and vent are dark. Females are similar to the males but are paler with less red on the belly. Juveniles are duller with little or no red on the belly, fainter dark barring and a black bill. Similar species include the black-rumped, crimson- rumped and black-lored waxbills. The black-rumped waxbill is black rather than brown on the rump and has a pale vent (area underneath the tail). The crimson- rumped waxbill has a dark bill, red rump and some red on the wings and tail. The black-lored waxbill (found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo) has a black rather than red stripe through the eye. The common waxbill has a variety of twittering and buzzing calls and a distinctive high-pitched flight-call. The simple song is harsh and nasal and descends on the last note. Distribution and habitat =Native range= There are about 17 subspecies distributed widely across much of Africa south of the Sahara. They are present in most parts of East, Central and Southern Africa except for regions of desert or dense forest. In West Africa they are more local with the main population centred on Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Ivory Coast. Common waxbills inhabit open country with long grass and rank vegetation. They are often found near water in marshes and among reeds. They can be tame and will enter gardens, parks and farmland. =Introduced range= Two in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil Birds have often escaped from captivity or been deliberately released. Breeding populations have become established in many places where the climate is sufficiently warm and where there is a sufficient supply of grass seeds. They are now found on many islands around Africa: Saint Helena, Ascension Island, the Cape Verde Islands, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Mauritius, R√©union, Rodrigues, the Seychelles and Ile Amsterdam. They may possibly be native on some of these islands. In Europe the common waxbill has become widespread in Portugal and is spreading through Spain. There are small populations on Madeira and Gran Canaria and it has recently appeared on Tenerife and the Azores. In the Americas waxbills are found in Trinidad, several parts of Brazil and there are a few on Bermuda. In the Pacific there are populations on New Caledonia, Efate Island in Vanuatu, Tahiti and the Hawaiian Islands. In Spain it has been introduced in the largest cities in the last ten years and is now quite commonly seen in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, as well as along the Spanish-Portuguese border. Reproduction Estrilda astrild - MHNT The nest is a large ball of criss-crossed grass stems with a long downward-pointing entrance tube on one side. It is built in a cavity, usually low down amongst dense vegetation. A rudimentary second nest (\\"cock's nest\\") may be built on top where the male sleeps. Four to seven white eggs are laid. They are incubated for 11 to 13 days and the young birds fledge 17 to 21 days after hatching. Both parents take part in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. The timing of the breeding season varies in different parts of the world. Nests may be parasitized by the pin-tailed whydah which lays its eggs in the nests of estrildid finches. In captivity they will breed in an aviary and can raise four broods in a year. Feeding The diet consists mainly of grass seeds but insects are also eaten on occasions, especially during the breeding season when more protein is needed. The waxbills typically forage in flocks which may contain hundreds or even thousands of birds. They usually feed by clinging to the stems with their long, spindly claws and picking from the flower heads but they will also search for fallen seeds on the ground. They need to drink regularly as the seeds contain little water.

Function The HGM produces and provides geographic information for defense and development purposes, in addition to planning, standardizing and producing and maintaining geographic materials. The HGM consists of a team of experts and two B200 Beechcraft planes stationed at the G√ºvercinlik Army Air Base in Ankara. They have the capacity for global aerial coverage are open to any proposals from international bodies in need of their services. History =Early history= Turkish mapping dates to the 15th century. Some of the first examples of Turkish mapping include charts drawn by Ibrahim Mursel, and a world chart painted in nine colors on a deer skin by the famous navy commander of the Ottoman Empire, Admiral Piri Reis. A great number of maps can be found dating up to the 19th century which exemplify the historical aspect of Turkish mapping. =Mapping Commission= The establishment of the \\"Mapping Commission\\" in 1895, as a unit subordinate to the Fifth Department of the Turkish General Staff, is accepted as the beginning of modern cartography in Turkey. The Mapping Commission is considered the precursor to the current office, the General Command of Mapping. The Mapping Commission performed its preliminary works in five or six rooms reserved for them on the upper floor of the old Gendarmerie Office. Since the rapid production of the maps needed urgently for national defense required a larger and more capable organization, the Mapping Commission was arranged on October 28, 1918. The Commission was established as an independent mapping department of the Ministry of National Defense, which by that time had several branches: triangulation, topography, reconnaissance, cartography, central offices, a surveying battalion and a surveying school. =Koyunpazari= The Mapping Department moved to Ankara from Istanbul after the Turkish War of Independence. It was settled in the Attar Basi Khan in Koyunpazari, which at the time was almost in the center of the city. The printing section also started its work in the same building, which today is the School of Arts in Ulus. In 1924, the Department, which is still inside the General Directorate Garrison, moved to buildings located between the Military Sewing Plant and the General Directorate. Following this relocation, maps and plans required by governmental bodies, universities, and private companies were produced in line with the changes laid down after the foundation of the new state, the Turkish Republic. After these developments, a need arose for reorganization of the department. Lieut. Gen. M. Sevki (√ñl√ßer), now regarded as the founder of the General Command of Mapping, prepared a bill for the new organization, the General Directorate of Mapping. He sent it to the Ministry of National Defense in early 1925. =Legal change= According to the legal procedure, following the approval of Ministry of National Defense, the bill was passed to the Prime Ministry to be discussed in the Ministerial Council and presented to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the body with authority to pass the bill. As a result, the Law No. 657 was enacted by the parliament on May 2, 1925. This law authorized the re-organization of the Mapping Department under a new name, the \\"General Directorate of Mapping\\" reporting to the Ministry of National Defense. The law made the National Mapping Agency responsible for the production of all kinds of maps and plans to meet the requirements of Turkish Armed Forces and all governmental bodies, specifically ministries, universities, private companies and individuals. =General Command of Mapping= Law No. 657 was amended with Law No. 203 on January 2, 1961. Due to the policies created by the \\"Inter-Ministerial Commission for Coordinating and Planning of Mapping Affairs\\" and to the instructions set forth in the by-law for supply and usage of maps and mapping information, the General Directorate of Mapping was renamed in 1983 to the \\"General Command of Mapping\\".

It was released in January 2006. It is the successor of the W800.  Features  The W810 is part of Sony Ericsson's Walkman line of mobile phones. While being similar to the W800, the W810 benefited from several improvements. Most notably are quad band connectivity, EDGE support for faster wireless data transfers, a light level sensor, a slightly enhanced display, but slightly reduced battery life. Other features include a full function internet browser, two megapixel digital camera with auto-focus and flash, the HPM-70 stereo headset, Memory Stick PRO Duo slot, 20 MB of internal memory, and a music-only mode where phone functions are fully turned off, which also allows the phone to be used as a Walkman in areas mobile phones would usually be barred from, such as airplanes and hospitals, in addition to providing longer battery-life. The phone supported MP3, AMR, MIDI, IMY, EMY, WAV (16 kHZ maximum sample rate) and AAC audio formats and MPEG-4 and 3GPP video formats. However WMA audio format is not supported. While official support for Memory Stick PRO Duo is capped at 4 GB, users have reported using 16 GB sticks with full functionality (read and write), though at larger sizes, some functions (boot time, media playback, and file retrieval, for example) are noticeably slower.  Cosmetics  There were many small cosmetic changes from the W800, but most noticeable is the absence of the classic joystick that has been found on the majority of Sony Ericsson mobile phones since the T68i. This has been replaced by a D-pad designed to improve ease of use when listening to music and to provide a longer life to the keypad (as the classic joystick tended to fail due to dust, especially on some models like the K700). The casing color has changed from burnt orange and cream to \\"Satin Black\\" or \\"Fusion White\\". The sliding camera lens cover has also been omitted completely. However, a K750i or W800 back cover (with lens cover) will fit with minor modifications.  Availability  The Sony Ericsson W810 is available as the W810i for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and North America, and the W810c for mainland China. The W810 was released worldwide in January 2006. A white color variation officially called \\"Fusion White\\" was released on 20 June 2006.

A major 15th century posek, his published decisions in matters of halacha have been widely quoted in halachic literature for hundreds of years.  Biography  Simeon ben Tzemach was born in the Hebrew month of Adar, 1361. Various accounts put his birthplace as either Barcelona, or the island of Majorca.Tasbatz Vol.1, Jerusalem 1998 introduction p.20, quoting various conflicting earlier accounts. He was a near relation but not a grandson of Levi ben Gershon. He was a student of Ephraim Vidal, and of Jonah de Maestre, rabbi in Zaragoza or in Calatayud, whose daughter Bongoda he married. After the persecution of 1391 (in the Balearic Isles) and Majorca he fled Spain with his father and sister for Algiers, where, in addition to practicing medicine, he continued his studies during the earlier part of his stay. In 1394 he and the Algerian rabbi Isaac ben Sheshet (known as Rivash) drafted statutes for the Jewish community of Algiers. After Rivash's retirement, Duran became rabbi of Algiers in 1407. Unlike his predecessor, he refused on principle to accept any confirmation of his appointment by the regent.'Codex Judaica', Zichron Press, M.Kantor p.206 As Duran had lost all his property during the massacre at Palma, he was forced against his will to accept a salary from the community, not having other means of subsistence. He held this office until his death. His epitaph, written by himself, has been reprinted for the first time, from a manuscript, in Orient, Lit. v. 452. According to Joseph Sambari, Simon was much respected in court circles.Medieval Jew. Chron. i. 130 He was the father of the Rashbash. Duran's Magen Avot was a polemic against Christians and Muslims, of which the fourth chapter of the second part was published separately as Keshet u-Magen (The Arrow and the Shield).Jewish history and Jewish memory: essays in honor of Yosef Hayim p 39 Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, Elisheva Carlebach, John M. Efron - 1998  Works  Simon was prolific. He wrote commentaries on several tractates of the Mishnah and the Talmud and on Alfasi (Nos. 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, and 16 in the list of his works given below); he treated various religious dogmas as well as the synagogal rite of Algiers (Nos. 5, 8, 10, 16), while in his responsa he showed a profound acquaintance with the entire halakic literature. His theologico-philosophical scholarship, as well as his secular learning, is conspicuous in his elaborate work, Magen Abot, in which he also appears as a clever controversialist (No. 7). The same ability is evidenced in his writings against Hasdai Crescas, which afford him an opportunity to defend Maimonides (No. 2), in his commentary on the Pentateuch (No. 6), where he takes occasion to enter into polemics with Levi ben Gershon, and in that on the Book of Job (No. 1), especially the introduction. In his commentary on the Pirke Avot he shows a broad historical sense (No. 7, part iv.) and it is not improbable that the tradition which ascribes to him the historico-didactic poem Seder ha-Mishneh leha-Rambam (No. 9) is well founded. Simon also wrote a considerable number of poems, both religious and secular (Nos. 9 [?], 15); commented on the Pesah Haggadah, the Hoshanot, the works of more ancient poets (Nos. 5 (c), 13, 14), and he was the author of numerous pamphlets. The following list of Duran's writings is arranged according to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, on the basis of a catalogue drawn up by the author himself (Responsa, vol. iii.): # Oheb Mishpa·π≠, commentary on the Book of Job, with a theologico-philosophical introduction, Venice, 1589; Amsterdam, 1724-1727 (in the Rabbinic Bible ·∏≤ehillat Mosheh). # Or ha-·∏§ayyim, controversial treatise against Hasdai Crescas' Or Adonai. # Zohar ha-Ra·∏≥ia, commentary on Solomon ibn Gabirol's Azharot, Constantinople, 1515.

The missing chapter in this edition, being a polemic against Christianity and Islam, was published under the title ·∏≤eshet u-Magen (ib. 1785‚Äì1790; reedited by Steinschneider, Berlin, 1881). Extracts from this chapter, \\"Setirat Emunat ha-No·∫ìrim,\\" are contained in Mil·∏•emet ·∏§obah, Amsterdam, 1710.

Modern versions built in the early 20th century are more accurately referred to as \\"Dutch Colonial Revival\\", a subtype of the Colonial Revival style.  History  Wallabout Market in Brooklyn, designed by William Tubby in Dutch Colonial style in 1894‚Äì1896. The modern use of the term is to indicate a broad gambrel roof with flaring eaves that extend over the long sides, resembling a barn in construction. The early houses built by settlers were often a single room, with additions added to either end (or short side) and very often a porch along both long sides. Typically, walls were made of stone and a chimney was located on one or both ends. Common were double-hung sash windows with outward swinging wood shutters and a central double Dutch door. Settlers of the Dutch colonies in New York, Delaware, New Jersey, and western Connecticut built these homes in ways familiar to the regions of Europe from which they came, like the Low Countries, the Palatine parts of Germany, and Huguenot regions of France.Scheltema, Gajus and Westerhuijs, Heleen (eds.),Exploring Historic Dutch New York. Museum of the City of New York/Dover Publications, New York 2011 Used for its modern meaning of \\"gambrel-roofed house\\", the term does not reflect the fact that housing styles in Dutch-founded communities in New York evolved over time. In the Hudson Valley, for example, the use of brick, or brick and stone is perhaps more characteristic of Dutch Colonial houses than is their use of a gambrel roof. In Albany and Ulster Counties, frame houses were almost unknown before 1776, while in Dutchess and Westchester Counties, the presence of a greater proportion of settlers with English roots popularised more construction of wood-frame houses.Helen Wilkinson Reynolds, Dutch Houses in the Hudson Valley Before 1776, Payson and Clarke Ltd. for the Holland Society of New York, 1929. Reprinted by Dover Publications Inc. 1965. After a period of log cabin and bank-dugout construction, the use of the inverted \\"V\\" roof shape was common. The gambrel roof was used later, predominantly between 1725 and 1775, although examples can be found from as early as 1705. The general rule before 1776 was to build houses that were only one-and-a-half stories high, except in Albany, where there were a greater proportion of two-story houses. Fine examples of these houses can be found today, like those in the Huguenot Street Historic District of New Paltz, New York. In the American colonies both the Dutch and Germans plus others along the Rhine region of Europe contributed to the Dutch fashion. Three easily accessible examples of Dutch (Netherlands or German) architecture can be seen; 1.5 story 1676 Jan Martense Schenck House in the Brooklyn Museum, 1.5 story 1730s Schenck House located in the \\"Old Beth Page\\" Historic Village, and the two-story 1808 Gideon Tucker House at No. 2 White St at Broadway in Manhattan. All three represent distinctly Dutch (Netherlands- German) styles using \\"H-frame\\" for construction, wood clapboard, large rooms, double hung windows, off set front entry doors, sharply sloped roofs, and large \\"open\\" fireplaces. Often there is a Hipped roof, or curved eves, but not always. Barns in the Dutch-German fashion share the same attributes. Examples of hipped and not hipped roofs can be seen on the three examples provided above. The 1676 and 1730 Schenck houses are examples of Dutch houses with \\"H-frame\\" construction but without the \\"hipped\\" roof. The 1730 Schenck house has the distinctive \\"curved eves\\". Hips can be in a few different styles. The more common being a Mansard as known in Europe or \\"gambrel\\" as known in American English, both having two slopes on at least two sides. The Gideon Tucker (though an older Englishman) choose to build his house with a gambrel roof and in an urban Dutch-German fashion.  Revival in the 20th century  Stepped gables on early 20th-century Dutch Revival buildings on S William Street in Lower Manhattan recall the Dutch origins of the city. West End Collegiate Church at West 77th Street Beginning in the late 19th century, America began to look back romantically upon its colonial roots and the country started reflecting this nostalgia in its architecture. Within this Colonial Revival, one of the more popular designs was a redux of features of the original Dutch Colonial. The term \\"Dutch Colonial\\" appeared sometime between 1920 and 1925. Within the context of architectural history, the more modern style is specifically defined as \\"Dutch Colonial Revival\\" to distinguish it from the original Dutch Colonial. However, this style was popularly known simply as Dutch Colonial, and this continues to be the case today. In New York, for instance, the actual 17th-century colonial architecture of New Amsterdam has completely vanished (lost in the fires of 1776 and 1835), leaving only archaeological remnants. Up and through the 1930s, Dutch Colonials were most popular in the Northeast. While the original design was always reflected, some details were updated such as the primary entryway moving from the end to the long side of the house. The more modern versions also varied a great deal with regard to materials used, architectural details, and size. For example, one Dutch Colonial might be a small two-story structure of with dormers bearing shed-like overhangs, while another larger example would have three stories and a grand entrance adorned with a transom and sidelights.  Buildings  Examples of urban style of Dutch Colonial Revival architecture can be found in Manhattan, New York. 57 Stone Street was rebuilt in 1903 by C. P. H. Gilbert on behest of the owner Amos F. Eno. The buildings to the back on South William Street 13‚Äì23 also were reconstructed in the Dutch revival style, evoking New Amsterdam with the use of red brick as building material and the features of stepped gables. Stepped gables on early 20th-century Dutch Revival buildings on S William Street in Lower Manhattan recall the Dutch origins of the city. The area was declared a historic district in 1996 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Children's Aid Society had a number of its centers constructed in the Dutch colonial revival style, such as the Rhinelander Children's Center at 350 East 88th Street, the 6th Street Industrial School on 630 East 6th Street, the Fourteenth Ward Industrial School at 256‚Äì258 Mott Street, and the Elizabeth Home for Girls at 307 East 12th Street. West End Avenue saw a large number of buildings designed in the Dutch colonial revival style. The West End Collegiate Church was modelled after the Vleeshal at the Grote Markt in Haarlem. Further examples in New York City are the former George S. Bowdoin Stable at 149 East 38th Street, 119 West 81st Street, and 18 West 37th Street. An industrial example was the Wallabout Market, designed by the architect William Tubby and constructed in 1894‚Äì1896. They were demolished in 1941 during World War II. Sunnyside in Tarrytown, New York, was partly constructed in Dutch Colonial revival. 112 Ocean Avenue, a Dutch Colonial home, became infamous as the site of the \\"Amityville Horror\\".

It was conquered by France in 1901. History =Origins= Under the Songhai empire, Dendi had been the easternmost province, governed by the prestigious Dendi-fari (\\"governor of the eastern front\\"). Askia Ishaq II fled to here after he was defeated by the invading Saadi dynasty of Morocco at the Battle of Tondibi and at another battle seven months later. In Dendi, he was deposed by his brother Muhammad Gao, who was in turn murdered on the order of the Moroccan pasha. The Moroccans then appointed Sulayman as puppet king ruling the Niger between Djenn√© and Gao. South of Tillaberi the Songhai resistance against Morocco continued under Askia Nuh, a son of Askia Dawud. He established his capital at the yet unlocalized town of Lulami.http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAfrica/AfricaNiger.htm History Files =Conflict with the Saadi dynasty= After the Moroccans had Askia Sulayman appointed as their puppet the pasha, Mahmud ibn Zarqun, attempted to conquer Dendi. Askia Nuh resisted the invasion by a costly guerilla warfare lasting two years. In 1594 Mahmud was forced to discontinue the war and retreated, just to be killed in the same year by Dogon, with whom Nuh was probably allied. The new pasha called Mansur continued the war against Dendi and again Nuh resorted to guerilla warfare. This situation lasted until 1599, when Nuh's followers became tired of the war and deposed him in favor of his brother Harun. In 1609, the city of Djenn√© revolted against the Saadi pashas with Dendi support. The Saadi were eventually able to regain the city, but with a lack of support from their homeland, they soon abandoned the area, leaving it to Tuareg and Fulbe nomads. In 1612, Askiya al-Amin came to power in Dendi. His short reign of six years was followed by the rule of Askiya Dawud. Dawud killed many people during his reign including relatives and members of the military. His brother, Isma'il, fled to Timbuktu and sought Saadi support to overthrow al-Amin. Isma'il returned in to Dendi and deposed his brother in 1639. Upon attempting to send the foreign army back, he was deposed and replaced by a ruler that the pashas felt would be easier to deal with. This ruler was eventually removed by the Songhai people. =Decline= Dendi existed for the next two and a half centuries witnessing increasingly unstable reigns, coups and counter-coups. When France entered the region, Dendi was defensively unprepared. In 1901, the French deposed the last askiya of the Dendi, ending Songhai's control of either Mali or Niger until independence.

Since 1941, has partnered with local units of government to provide retirement, disability and death benefits for public employees. With a funded status of about 93 percent and nearly $40 billion in assets, IMRF is well-funded and sustainable. Today, IMRF has more than 410,000 members and serves about 3,000 different units of government, including towns and villages, libraries and park districts, and counties and school districts (non-teaching personnel). The average member who retired in 2016 is receiving a monthly pension of $1,791. In 2017, IMRF received an Illinois Performance Excellence (ILPEx)] Gold Award for Achievement of Excellence. IMRF is governed by an elected board of trustees. IMRF is administered by a staff of 200 professionals, led by Executive Director Brian Collins.  Mission statement  To efficiently and impartially develop, implement, and administer in a prudent manner programs that provide income protection to members and their beneficiaries on behalf of participating employers.  Plan structure and current administration  = Board of Trustees = IMRF is established under statutes adopted by the Illinois General Assembly. It is governed by a fully elected board of eight trustees. Four trustees are elected by employers, three are elected by participating members, and one annuitant trustee is elected by IMRF retirees. The Board appoints an Executive Director who is responsible for all administrative functions and supervision of staff employees. = Plan structure = IMRF is a defined benefit retirement plan that provides retirement, survivor, disability, and death benefits to municipal government employees in Illinois. It is governed by Article 7 of the Illinois Pension Code. Eligible employees are automatically enrolled in IMRF when employment begins. About 98% of IMRF's membership participates in the Regular Plan. IMRF administers a separate plan for Sheriffs' Law Enforcement Personnel (SLEP). Members participate as either Tier 1 or Tier 2 members. To participate as a Tier 1 member, the employee must have started work with an IMRF employer on or before December 31, 2010. All other members participate in Tier 2. All IMRF Tier 2 plans have a less generous benefit structure as compared to Tier 1. The cost to provide a Tier 2 pension is more than 40% less than the cost of providing a Tier 1 pension. IMRF expects half of its membership to participate in Tier 2 by 2019.  IMRF history  = How IMRF was founded = The 61st General Assembly of the State of Illinois created IMRF, effective July 29, 1939. The first meeting of the IMRF board was held on September 8, 1939, in the office of the Municipal Public Utility annuity and benefit fund at 135 S. LaSalle St. in Chicago. = Five original employers enroll = IMRF began operation on January 1, 1941, with five original employers, City of Evanston, City of Galesburg, Village of Riverside, Rockford Park District and City of Rockford. The first benefit awards were approved at the March 1941 board meeting. At that same meeting, the board approved IMRF's first investment, a $5,000 Treasury bond at 2¬Ω percent due on March 15 of 1952 or 1954, with the assumption that 1952 was an option year. = Additional groups covered = In 1947, the Illinois legislature required the IMRF staff to participate as members of the system. Later in that same year, the Illinois legislature mandated participation by all Illinois school districts (except those located in the city of Chicago) and all their employees except those covered by the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois. Coverage of schools increased the number of employers in IMRF from 156 to 652 and the number of members from 11,171 to 17,119. Effective January 1, 1951, all cities, villages, and incorporated towns with populations of 10,000 or more and all counties (except Cook County) and sanitary districts (except Metropolitan Chicago Sanitary District) were mandated by legislation into IMRF. In 1955, an Illinois Supreme Court decision ruled that IMRF statutes provided an option for municipalities to enter, but none to exit. = Retirement Systems Reciprocal Act = In 1955, IMRF was included in the Retirement Systems Reciprocal Act, a provision of the statutes which allows total service with any of several public pension systems in Illinois to be considered when determining an annuity.

He sang the role of Sarastro in the premiere of Mozart's opera The Magic Flute.Source for this paragraph: Grove Life Gerl was born on in Andorf (then Bavaria, since 1780 part of Austria). He sang as a chorister as a child in Salzburg; the New Grove asserts that he was probably the pupil of Leopold Mozart. He attended the University of Salzburg, studying logic and physics. His career as a bass began in 1785 with the theatrical company of Ludwig Schmidt. He evidently had an impressively low vocal range; Branscombe (1991) observes that the very low notes that Mozart included in the part of Sarastro have been \\"the despair of many a bass singer since.\\"Branscombe 1991, 128 By 1787 he had joined the theatrical company of Emanuel Schikaneder, for which he sang the demanding role of Osmin in Mozart's opera The Abduction from the Seraglio and other roles. In 1789 the troupe settled at the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna. Gerl participated in a system of joint composition used by Schikaneder's troupe, in which Singspiele were produced rapidly by having several composers collaborate. As such, Gerl may have been the composer of the aria \\"Ein Weib ist das herrlichste Ding\\", for which Mozart wrote a set of variations for piano, K. 613 (the composer may instead have been another singer-composer in the troupe, Benedikt Schack). Mozart gradually came to participate more in the activities of the Schikaneder troupe, culminating in his opera The Magic Flute (1791), with libretto by Schikaneder. Gerl premiered the role of Sarastro, and continued to sing this part in many performances through 1792. He left Schikaneder's troupe in 1793. Gerl may have been a participant in a rehearsal of Mozart's Requiem on the day before the composer died; for details see Benedikt Schack. Gerl's later career took him to Brno and Mannheim, where he retired in 1826. He died there on . Assessment Peter Branscombe, writing in the New Grove, offers the following concerning Gerl's reputation as a singer: \\"When Schr√∂der, the greatest actor-manager of his age, went to Vienna in 1791 he was told not to miss hearing [Benedikt] Schack and Gerl at Schikaneder's theatre.\\" Branscombe also notes the striking quality of the music that Mozart wrote for Gerl. Family Gerl married the soprano Barbara Reisinger (1770‚Äì1806) on 2 September 1789. She also sang in the Schikaneder troupe, and performed the role of Papagena at the Magic Flute premiere. She went with Gerl to Brno and Mannheim, and died there shortly after giving birth to their second child. Notes References *Branscombe, Peter (1991) W. A. Mozart: Die Zauberfl√∂te.

See also Nephi (disambiguation). According to the Book of Mormon, Nephi ( ) the Disciple was a Nephite prophet during the 1st century, and a chosen disciple of Jesus Christ. Nephi's ministry was centered on Christ, and included prophesying of His birth, working miracles in His name, witnessing His visitation to the Americas after the Resurrection, and administering His church after He had ascended. Nephi was also the appointed recordkeeper for the Nephites during this period, and much of the text of Third Nephi is abridged from his account. Known genealogy  Early life  Nephi is first mentioned in the Book of Mormon when he inherits the Nephite records and sacred artifacts from his father, Nephi, son of Helaman, in the year 1 B.C.3 Nephi 1:1-3 He lived (and was likely raised) in the Nephite capital city, Zarahemla, where his father lived and subsequently departed from, leaving Nephi with the full responsibilities of scribe.3 Nephi 2:9 Neither Nephi's childhood nor age are referenced in the abridgement, although he had at least one younger sibling, Timothy. It is believed that he was born in 30 BC.  Pre-Christ Ministry  In the ninety-second year of the Reign of the Judges (1 BC), a \\"great uproar\\" broke out amongst the population over the yet-unfulfilled (and according to the \\"unbelievers\\", past-due) prophecy of Samuel the Lamanite, that Christ's birth would be signified by a new star and a night without darkness.3 Nephi 1:4-8Helaman 14:3-5 Those who continued to look forward to the sign of Christ were scheduled for a mass execution. Nephi, deeply disturbed by the wickedness of the people, \\"prayed mightily\\" to God for the condemned believers, even all day. Finally, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying: \\"Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.\\" 3 Nephi 1:10‚Äì13 As promised, when the sun set that evening, the sky remained as bright as midday, fulfilling the anticipated prophecies and effectively preventing the impending genocide. A majority of the population was converted by this event, and Nephi went about \\"baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins\\", which temporarily restored peace to the land.3 Nephi 1:23 Despite the mass change of heart, and the continued preaching of Nephi and \\"many others\\" however, by 96 ROJ (AD 3), the people had already returned to wickedness and discrediting the miracles they had seen.3 Nephi 2:1-3 For the next twenty-seven years, they would continue to fluctuate between extremes of piousness and rebellion, until finally abandoning their faith altogether. The government of over 120 years was intentionally corrupted and assassinated into extinction, and the society unraveled into tribes.3 Nephi 7:1-4 Nephi, having witnessed this downfall, renewed his efforts and began to preach with such boldness and power that the people \\"were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words\\".3 Nephi 7:18 Additionally, Nephi performed miracles in the name of Christ, including casting out devils, healing the sick, and raising his brother from the dead.3 Nephi 7:20,22 He continued to preach and baptize throughout AD 33, converting \\"many\\".3 Nephi 7:26 In the advent of the next year, the signs of Christ's death, three hours of unparalleled destruction followed by three days of darkness (also prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite) were given.

The White Shark Caf√© is a remote mid-Pacific Ocean area noted as a winter and spring habitat of otherwise coastal great white sharks. The area, halfway between Baja California and Hawaii, received its unofficial name in 2002 from researchers at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station who were studying the great white shark species using satellite tracking tags. They identified a zone with a radius of approximately centered at approximately . The findings, which were initially published in the January 3, 2002 issue of the journal Nature, showed three of four tagged sharks traveled to the Caf√© during a six-month period after they were tagged off the central coast of California. Although the area had not previously been suspected as a shark habitat, when mapping the satellite tracking data, researchers discovered that members of the species frequently travel to and loiter in the area. It was once believed the area had very little food for the animals (researchers described it as the shark equivalent of a desert), but research in early 2018 by the vessel Falkor showed that there is a rich and diverse food chain too deep to be detected by satellites that provides a potentially abundant food supply for the sharks. Male, female, and juvenile great whites have been tracked there. The sharks tracked to the area came from diverse rookeries along the North American coast. They typically took up to 100 days to arrive, traveling around , during which they make periodic dives as deep as . While at the Caf√©, they dive to depths of as often as once every ten minutes. By 2006, researchers had observed consistent migration and other behavior. Tracking data indicates that white sharks will leave feeding grounds near the coast in winter, travel to the Caf√©, and some may even summer near Hawaii. But many linger in the Caf√©, often for months, before returning to the coast in the fall, coinciding with the elephant seal breeding season (a favored prey).

Ikastolak can be nowadays either private or public, divided into different networks. The Basque language public network relies on state funding and management, allocated in Spain by the education institutions of the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre in their corresponding territories, while in France the association Ikas-Bi in the public network advocates for bilingual education. Seaska is the private network of Basque language schools in the French Basque Country, closely linked to the similar network in the Southern Basque Country. The private networks base their activity on the fees paid by parents, popular subscription (either directly or by means of annual massive festivals, e.g. Herri Urrats, Nafarroa Oinez, Araba Euskaraz, etc.) and the allowance provided by public educational institutions.  History  The Salbatore Mitxelena ikastola of Zarautz Although spoken more widely than in later times, there was very little schooling undertaken in Basque before the early 20th century revival in Basque nationalism. Spanish and French were mandatory in schooling at either side of the border. The first official ikastola was opened in 1914, and the movement to transfer the medium of education in the Southern Basque Country from Spanish to Basque became widespread in the late 20th century. During the early 1930s, the seeds of the \\"Basque Schools\\" () were sown in Navarre by the Basque Nationalist Party, featuring an instruction where the teachings of the Christian doctrine were central. They were conceived as an attempt to counter increased laicization of state schools and the lack of focus (\\"the neutrality\\") on Basque matters in regular religious schooling. The first such educative institution was founded in November 1931 at Pamplona, followed by another one in Estella-Lizarra (1933) and Elizondo (1935). Following the Republican defeat in the Spanish Civil War, the public use of Basque was made illegal, and all educational institutions were forced to teach entirely through the medium of Castilian, to the complete neglect and persecution of Basque. There are, however, isolated examples of ikastolak which clandestinely continued to teach in Basque. Since thousands of children were studying out of the authorized schools and hence forbidden to progress to higher education, in 1969 the Roman Catholic Church arranged with the parent associations the lawful Diocesan Federation of Ikastolas, later becoming a secular federation. With the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975, large degrees of self-government were given to the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre, and ikastolak sprang up all over the Basque region in northern Spain. For a time, the ikastolak operated along the public school system, the private schools publicly funded under a charter and the private schools. During his term as Basque minister for education, the Socialist Fernando Buesa proposed the 1993 Law of the Basque Public School, prompting ikastolak to choose between full integration in the public system or operating under the rules for chartered private schools. At the present time, tens of thousands of schoolchildren in the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre attend ikastolak, but the status of ikastolak differs greatly depending on their location. They are firmly entrenched in the traditionally Basque-speaking areas of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC), but less so in non-Basque speaking areas (i.e. the southern fringes). Basque language schools in the north of Navarre do not enjoy the same support from the regional government as they do in the BAC, but they are officially recognised and enjoy widespread local support (traditionally Basque speaking), unlike central and southern areas of Navarre, where they lack public recognition and funding, remaining in a legal limbo until 2007. In the French Basque Country, the ikastolak developed later, but grew steadily, so much so that a network, Seaska, is now widespread throughout the whole territory covering education up to the A levels.

It is traditionally indicated by hanging a broom from a mast or lashing it to the periscope of a submarine. History It is said the use of brooms in this respect originated during the 1650s, when the Dutch Admiral Maarten Tromp, after a decisive victory in the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Battle of Dungeness of 1652, hung a broom from his mast to indicate he had \\"swept the British from the seas\\" - his opponent Admiral Blake is said to have responded with the hoisting of a whip, indicating he would whip the Dutch into submission. However, both stories are legends; a broom in the seventeenth century indicated the ship was for sale.Rodger, N.A.M., 2005, The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain, 1649-1815, W.W. Norton & Company, 976 pp The United States Submarine Service during World War II generally considered a patrol a \\"clean sweep\\" if the sub sank every target she engaged. Individual torpedoes might miss, and convoys usually had far too many ships for all to be sunk by a single boat, but these unavoidable inefficiencies did not mar a \\"clean sweep.\\" Recent variations Few wide-ranging war patrols have been conducted since World War II, so commanding officers have taken other opportunities to fly brooms. For example, in the year 2000 the Military Sealift Command hung a broom from the flagpole yardarm outside their headquarters to symbolize its \\"clean sweep\\" of the Y2K bug on all the command's ships. In 2003, under circumstances perhaps closer to the traditional context, after USS Cheyenne launched her Tomahawk missiles during Operation Iraqi Freedom, her commanding officer decided that placing all missiles on target, with no duds or failures, was a modern \\"clean sweep.\\" For decades, brooms have been flown by warships that successfully pass all elements of their sea trials.

Species form hypogeous sporocarps commonly referred to as \\"false truffles\\". The general morphological characters of Rhizopogon sporocarps are a simplex or duplex peridium surrounding a loculate gleba that lacks a columnella. Basidiospores are produced upon basidia that are borne within the fungal hymenium that coats the interior surface of gleba locules. The peridium is often adorned with thick mycelial cords, also known as rhizomorphs, that attach the sporocarp to the surrounding substrate. The scientific name Rhizopogon is Greek for 'root' (Rhiz-) 'beard' (-pogon) and this name was given in reference to the rhizomorphs found on sporocarps of many species. Rhizopogon species are primarily found in ectomycorrhizal association with trees in the family Pinaceae and are especially common symbionts of pine, fir, and Douglas fir trees. Through their ectomycorrhizal relationships Rhizopogon are thought to play an important role in the ecology of coniferous forests. Recent micromorphological and molecular phylogenetic study has established that Rhizopogon is a member of the Boletales, closely related to Suillus. Taxonomy and diversity A sporocarp of Rhizopogon luteolus (=obtextus) showing rhizomorphs with adhering substrate =Historical classification= The genus Rhizopogon occurs throughout the natural and introduced ranges of family Pinaceae trees. Though this range covers much of the northern temperate zones, the diversity of Rhizopogon species is well characterized only in North America and Europe. There are currently over 150 recognized species of Rhizopogon. The morphology of Rhizopogon species is highly cryptic and characters vary greatly throughout sporocarp maturity. This has led to the description of multiple species from various developmental stages of a single fungus. The genus Rhizopogon was first described from Europe by Elias Magnus Fries in 1817. The North American monograph was produced by Alexander H. Smith in 1966 with second author credits given posthumously to Sanford Myron Zeller due to his contributions to the study of the genus. A European monograph of Rhizopogon has also been published. In the recent past, molecular phylogenetic methods have allowed the revision of the taxonomic concepts of the genus Rhizopogon =Modern classification= Modern taxonomic concepts of the genus Rhizopogon recognize five subgenera of Rhizopogon. These are subgenus Rhizopogon, subgenus Versicolores, subgenus Villosuli, subgenus Amylopogon, and subgenus Roseoli. Ecology A sporocarp of Rhizopogon roseolus in cross section showing a close up of the gleba locules =Mammalian diet and spore dispersal= Rhizopogon species have been established as a common component in the diet of many small mammals as well as deer in Western North America. The viability of Rhizopogon spores is maintained and may even be increased after mammalian gut passage, making mammals an important dispersal vector for Rhizopogon. =Disturbance ecology= Rhizopogon species are common members of the fungal communities that colonize the roots of trees during seedling establishment and persist into old growth stands. Rhizopogon spores are long lived in soil and the spores of some species can persist for at least four years with an increase in viability over time. Rhizopogon seems to be especially common upon the roots of establishing tree seedlings following disturbance such as fire or logging. Rhizopogon are also abundant colonizers of pot cultivated and field cultivated conifer seedlings growing in soil from conifer stands that lacked observations of Rhizopogon upon the roots of mature trees. These finding suggest that Rhizopogon species are an important factor in the recovery of conifer forests following disturbance. = Invasive facilitator = Rhizopogon species have been shown to have a global distribution in the Homogenocene . The enzymes exuded from some species within the subgenus amylopogon is essential in activating seed germination in some species of Monotropoideae, such as Pterspora andromedeae . This makes Rhizopogon an obligatory host to species like P. andromedeae. The exoenzymatic activity also confers higher competitive advantages to host species, mainly within the genus Pinus, by helping to break down nutrients within the soil. The presence of Rhizopogon in soil facilitates Pinus as an invasive species. This exoenzymatic activity is nitrogen limited. In the case of R. amylopogon parasitized by P. andromedeae the nitrogen cost of exoenzymatic production is in part paid for by bacteria within the family Burkholderiaceae that is hosted by P. andromedeae = Species = *Rhizopogon albidus *Rhizopogon ater *Rhizopogon amylopogon *Rhizopogon atroviolaceus *Rhizopogon brunneniger *Rhizopogon ellenae *Rhizopogon evadens *Rhizopogon fulvigleba *Rhizopogon fuscorubens *Rhizopogon hawkerae *Rhizopogon luteolus *Rhizopogon nigrescens *Rhizopogon occidentalis *Rhizopogon ochraceorubens *Rhizopogon parksii *Rhizopogon parvisporus *Rhizopogon pedicellus *Rhizopogon roseolus *Rhizopogon salebrosus *Rhizopogon subareolatus *Rhizopogon subaustralis *Rhizopogon subcaerulescens *Rhizopogon subpurpurascens *Rhizopogon subsalmonius *Rhizopogon succosus *Rhizopogon togasawariana *Rhizopogon truncatus *Rhizopogon vesiculosus *Rhizopogon villosulus *Rhizopogon vinicolor *Rhizopogon vulgaris Ethnomycology =Forestry= The first intentional use of Rhizopogon species in forestry occurred in the early part of the 20th century when Rhizopogon luteolus was deliberately introduced into Pinus radiata plantations in Western Australia after it was observed to improve tree growth. Since that time, Rhizopogon species have been widely studied as a component of managed forests. Rhizopogon species have been noted as common members of the ectomycorrhizal community colonizing tree roots of pine and Douglas-fir timber plantations. Naturally occurring Rhizopogon roseolus (=rubescens) spores have been shown to out-compete the spores of other ectomycorrhizal fungi in pine plantations even when competing spores were directly inoculated onto seedlings. The survival rate and performance of pine and Douglas-fir plantation seedlings are increased after inoculation with Rhizopogon species. =Gastronomy= Though many species of Rhizopogon are considered edible, most are not held in high culinary esteem. A notable exception is Rhizopogon roseolus (=rubescens) which is considered a delicacy in east Asia and especially in Japan where it is traditionally known as Shoro. Techniques for the commercial cultivation of this fungus in pine plantations have been developed and applied with successful results in Japan and New Zealand.

One of the first projects brought to them was by Nic Cester of Jet who had formed the Australian supergroup The Wrights in 2004. The project resulted in a re-make of the 11 minute mid-70s hit for Stevie Wright, \\"Evie Parts 1, 2 & 3\\" which peaked in the Australian ARIAnet singles chart at #2 in March 2005. Later that year Harry and Daniel teamed up with David Hasselhoff, recording and producing the #3 UK Singles Chart hit \\"Jump In My Car\\". Other projects include British India whose debut album Guillotine was nominated for Triple J's J Award in 2007. In December of that year British India won the AIR Award for 'Best New Independent Artist' and finished off the year with two entries in Triple J's Hottest 100, 2007.

Biography  Rabbi Yeshaya Steiner was born in 1851 to Rabbi Moshe and Hentsha Miriam Steiner in the village of Zborov near Bardeyov (today in Slovakia). When he was 3 years old, his father died. At the age of 12, his mother sent him to study in Hungary with Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh of Liska the author of Ach Pri Tevua, who later appointed him as his servant (Gabbai). When Tzvi Hirsh died and his son-in-law Rabbi Chaim Friedlander author of Tal Chaim succeeded him, Steiner started travelling to Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Sanz. After the death of Rabbi Chaim of Sanz, he became a disciple of Rabbi Mordechai Leifer. Rabbi Mordechai Leifer suggested that he move to the town of Kerestir, in Hungary. In Kerestir, Steiner became a Hasidic Rebbe and became known as a miracle worker, and tens of thousands of Hasidim came to his court. He was known as hospitable on an institutional scale. In recent years, hospitality projects have developed in his town of Kerestir.

T. Vasudevan Nair, widely credited as his masterpiece. The work won the Vayalar Award, given for the best literary work in Malayalam, in 1985. It also won the Muttathu Varkey Award in 1994. The novel has been translated to multiple languages. It was translated into English as Second Turn in 1997. Another English translation by Gita Krishnankutty published in 2013 is titled Bhima: Lone Warrior. The novel is a retelling of the Indian epic Mahabharata from the perspective of Bhima, the second Pandava. The story deviates from the traditional Mahabharata story as it avoids the divine elements of the ancient epic and re-represent the characters and events realistically. One of the reasons critics cite for the novel's cult following is its revisionism, that was a first time in Malayalam literature. The book was translated to Tamil by Kurunjivelan as \\"Irandaam Idam\\" with cover illustration by Trotsky Marudu. A film adaptation starring Mohanlal is scheduled for 2025; it is set to become India's most expensive film production at US$155 million and the most expensive non-English-language film. Plot The story begins with the incident of Mahaprasthanika Parva where the Pandavas leave for the pilgrimage to Himalayas forsaking all the worldly possessions. The story runs through the eyes of Bhima who faces seemingly severe frustrations as a young man. Always destined to be second to his weak elder brother Yudhishthira in seniority and younger brother Arjuna in fame and popularity, Bhima is not given his due as the main architect of the Pandava victory over their cousins Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war, despite killing all the 100 Kauravas. The book unravels all the hardship and dilemmas encountered by Bhima which remain unnoticed. The book explores the emotions of the mighty Pandava as a son, brother, husband and father. The book brings to light the affection that he holds for his wife draupadi and how unnoticed his acts of love remains. The story questions the mourning of Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu when he is killed during the battle while trying to break the Chakravyuh formation, while Bhima's son, Ghatokkach is led to his death by sacrificing his life to save Arjuna's life and his sacrifice too remains unsung and everyone enjoys the happiness of saving Arjuna's life. Towards the end of the book he is shown as the only husband who seems to stop trying to be with draupadi at her last moment during their pilgrimage. Film adaptation In 2011, director Hariharan announced his plan to adapt Randamoozham to screen, scripted by M. T. Vasudevan Nair himself with Mohanlal cast to play Bhima.http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/bheemas- outing/article2615566.ece Later, V. A. Shrikumar Menon took the project again with Mohanlal in the lead, it was announced in April 2017 that the film adaptation will be produced by B. R. Shetty. With its 1000 crore (10 billion) budget, the film is expected to be the most expensive film in Indian cinema, and the most expensive non-English language film. The film will be shot in two parts. The first part is planned to be released in 2025 and the second part to released in 2030. Plans for the movie has since been shelved after MT Vasudevan Nair was upset with the pace at which the film was progressing and demanding Srikumar Menon to return the script.

They are the type genus of the tribe Xestiini in subfamily Noctuinae, though some authors merge this tribe with the Noctuini. Species in this genus are commonly known as \\"clays\\", \\"darts\\" or \\"rustics\\", but such names are commonplace among Noctuidae. Xestia moths have a wide distribution, though they most prominently occur in the Holarctic. With almost 200 species included at one time, Xestia was something of a \\"wastebin genus\\". But almost half of the traditional species are now placed elsewhere (see below), and some of the remaining ones are liable to be assigned to another genus also. On the other hand, new moths that probably do belong in this genus are still being discovered (e.g. X. hypographa, which led to the 2002 transfer of X. ornata from Eugraphe to here). Thus, unless there are drastic taxonomic changes in the future, Xestia is likely to remain one of the larger noctuine genera.Varga & Ronkay (2003), Pitkin & Jenkins (2004), and see references in Savela (2009) Ecology Xestia adults are usually of medium size and robust build, with stout hairy bodies and strong wings. Some are quite colorful, with bold lighter markings and hindwings in delicate yellowish, reddish or bluish hues. Generally, they are cryptic while at rest however, with unmarked pale or dull brownish hindwings; they do not have metallic hues and few species possess obvious eyespots.See references in Savela (2009) Caterpillar of the double square-spot (X. triangulum) This genus includes many species living at high latitudes and altitudes, in tundra and taiga ecosystems. Some have two-year (semivoltine) life cycles and only occur as adults every other year; typically the caterpillar larva overwinters to pupate in spring, with the moths flying around midsummer, but some species eclose later, their moths flying from late summer into autumn. Xestia caterpillars are generally stout and cryptically colored; in some species they have quite prominent dark lengthwise spots, but may e.g. be entirely green or whatever else gives best camouflage. Some species' larvae are notoriously polyphagous, e.g. the setaceous Hebrew character (X. c-nigrum), the food of which includes all sorts of core eudicots - including solanaceae and others which are poisonous to many herbivores - as well as some monocots. The latter are mainly Poaceae however, and few other monocots are utilized by Xestia larvae in general. Ericaceae, as well as Betulaceae and Poaceae, are key food plants for many of the high-latitude species. Gymnosperms are food plants of secondary importance in this genus, but Pinaceae form the mainstay or exclusive food of some species which occasionally become more than nuisance pests. Altogether, Xestia moths are only known as major pests within limited areas or in regard to specific plants, in which cases damage can be economically significant though. Even though the larval food plants of many Xestia species are not or insufficiently known, those on record are from all major lineages of core eudicots. Among the basal core eudicots, Caryophyllales (especially Polygonaceae) are particularly significant, of the asterids the Asterales (especially Asteraceae), Ericales (especially Ericaceae) and Lamiales (especially Plantaginaceae), and of the rosids the Malpighiales (numerous families) and Rosales (especially Rosaceae). Less important asterid orders among Xestia food plants are for example Dipsacales, Gentianales and Solanales, of the rosids e.g. Fabales, Fagales, Malvales, Myrtales and Sapindales. More basal (mes)angiosperms do not seem to be significant as Xestia food plants, at least not in temperate and cooler regions. As far as is known, Xestia adults are nocturnal or crepuscular (except of course the high- latitude species), but are often attracted to lights at night. They general feed on flowers with relatively short or no corolla, and will also drink other sugary liquids. Systematics and taxonomy Several species formerly placed here are now in Agnorisma and Pseudohermonassa; whether other genera are accepted varies among authors; Estimata, Hemigraphiphora and Perinaenia are provisionally considered distinct here. \\"Xestia\\" versuta does not seem to belong in the present genus; it may be an aberrant member of Goniographa, but until this is resolved it is here treated under its original name Eugraphe versuta.Varga & Ronkay (2003), Pitkin & Jenkins (2004) Furthermore, a case for separation has in particular been made for Amathes (possibly including Agrotiphila), Lytaea, Megasema (possibly including Megarhomba), Segetia and Schoyenia (with Archanarta occasionally also separate), but these are here included in Xestia. Some of them are, however, recognized as subgenera, and if the genus is split further would be first to become elevated in rank again. There is no real good justification for either treatment, except that the lengthy process of a thorough revision of noctuine systematics and taxonomy has only progressed so far. H. Beck in 1996 published a comprehensive taxonomic catalogue, introducing generic names for most European groups of (presumably) related species. While few of these seem to stand any chance ever to be widely recognized as distinct genera, this step is likely to have made available a generic name for any taxa that are eventually split from Xestia sensu stricto.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004), Beck (2006), and see references in Savela (2009) =Synonyms= Square-spot rustic (X. xanthographa), sometimes split off in Segetia with its presumed relatives, seems too close to X. ochreago to warrant such a treatment. Junior synonyms and other obsolete generic names for Xestia moths are: * Agrotimorpha Barnes & Benjamin, 1929 * Agrotiphila Grote, 1876 * Amathes H√ºbner, [1821] * Anomogyna Staudinger, 1871 * Archanarta Barnes & Benjamin, 1929 * Ashworthia Beck, 1996 * Asworthia (lapsus) * Barrovia Barnes & McDunnough, 1916 * Calamogyna (lapsus) * Calanomogyna Beck, 1996 * Calocestia (lapsus) * Caloxestia Beck, 1996 * Castanasta Beck, 1996 * Cenigria Beck, 1996 * Epipsiliamorpha Barnes & Benjamin, 1929 * Ericathia Beck, 1996 * Hiptelia Guen√©e, 1852 * Hypoxestia Hampson, 1903 * Hyptioxesta Rebel, 1901 * Knappia Nye, 1975 * Lankialaia Beck, 1996 * Lena Herz, 1903 (non Casey, 1886 preoccupied) * Litaea (lapsus) * Lorezea (lapsus) * Lorezia Beck, 1996 * Lytaea Stephens, 1829 * Megarhomba Beck, 1996 * Megasema H√ºbner, [1821] * Monticollia Beck, 1996 * Pachnobia Guen√©e, 1852 * Palaeamathes Boursin, 1964 * Paramathes Boursin, 1964 * Palkermes Beck, 1996 * Palkkermes (lapsus) * Peranomogyna Beck, 1996 * Platagrotis Smith, 1890 * Pteroscia Morrison, 1875 * Schoyenia Aurivillius, 1883 * Segetia Stephens, 1829 * Synanomogyna Beck, 1996 * Xenopachnobia Beck, 1996 Species The 110 or so species here placed in Xestia are divided among five subgenera. Two of these are further divided into groups, which are based on phenetic similarity however and may or may not form clades and/or species complexes. Some of these would presumably warrant recognition as subgenera if the present-day subgenera are split off; the subgeneric names that would apply are given (if known) in the addition to the species-group names.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004), and see references in Savela (2009) About one-third of the species here included in Xestia are incertae sedis (of unclear assignment). Among this group are a few species which are extremely little known, having been described long ago but studied only once or twice since then. =Subgenus Anomogyna= X.

Like many other typefaces designed by Hoefler & Co., the family is large, intended for professional use. It is designed with three separate optical sizes of font, intended for different sizes of text, as well as two different styles of capitals inside cartouches intended for title pages and frontispieces. It also contains fleurons and italic ligatures inspired by calligraphy, as well as stylistic alternates such as an alternative 'Y' character. Like typefaces of the period in which Arrighi worked, it does not contain a bold style, as these were only invented in the nineteenth century.

He was most associated with domestic interior scenes. Biography Peter Vilhelm Ilsted was born at Saksk√∏bing in Guldborgsund, Denmark. He was the son of merchant Jens Peter Ilsted and Johanne Sophie Lund. He was the brother-in-law of painter Vilhelm Hammersh√∏i (1864‚Äì1916). He married Ingeborg Lovisa Petersen (1869-1945) in 1891. He came to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1878, completing his course of study in five years. He made his debut at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1883. Two years later, he joined a study trip across Italy to Egypt, Palestine, Greece and Turkey. Later he visited Scotland, England, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Morocco and France. With support from the Cultural Ministry, he traveled to the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris. He was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1890 and 1899. He became an assistant at the Royal Danish Academy from 1893-1905 and worked periodically as a conservator- restorer. Ilsted died in Copenhagen during 1933. Artistic style Peter Ilsted and Vilhelm Hammersh√∏i, together with Carl Hols√∏e (1863‚Äì1935), were leading artists in early 20th-century Denmark. All three artists were members of the Free Exhibitions (Den Frie Udstilling), a progressive artists association founded in 1891. They are famous for painting images of \\"Sunshine and Silent Rooms\\", all in subtle colors. Their works reflect the orderliness of a tranquil life ‚Äî similar to the earlier works of Vermeer. Their art was later referred to as the ‚ÄòCopenhagen Interior School‚Äô. These interiors evoke at once a sense of calm and mystery. The orderly rooms are often viewed from behind‚Äîcausing one to wonder whether the scenes are really tranquil. James McNeill Whistler, Duret and important art critics were early admirers and collectors of Ilsted‚Äôs works. While at first glance their work appears similar, Ilsted and Hammersh√∏i were in fact quite different. Hammersh√∏i‚Äôs work has an aloof austerity, in contrast to Ilsted's scenes of common life. Though sometimes Hammersh√∏i‚Äôs colorful early pictures are reminiscent of James Tissot (1836‚Äì1902), his work is quintessentially Danish. However, Ilsted was more of a technician, and he made considerable contributions in the field of graphic arts. Ilsted‚Äôs mezzotints (sometimes printed in colour √† la poupe√©) were very popular and important in his day. They were an innovation in the media. Ilsted exhibited his work all over Europe, in London in 1907, in Germany and at the Paris Salon, where Europe‚Äôs art community was first exposed to his work. Ilsted was a great success in his lifetime and won many awards and accolades for his work. He was the only member of the group to also focus on printmaking. Ilsted‚Äôs achievements in mezzotints were revolutionary. Some of his mezzotints, most of which were created in black as well as color editions, are considered among the greatest ever made. His greatest contribution, which T. F. ≈†imon (187-1942), Manuel Robbe (1872- 1936), and others seemingly adopted was that of inking the plate √† la poup√©e. Some art historians have argued that these three men created the technique at about the same time but without consultation. This is uncertain. The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York) held an important exhibition on the work of Ilsted, Hammersh√∏i, and Vermeer in 2001.

Moored buoys have been in use since 1951, while drifting buoys have been used since 1979. Moored buoys are connected with the ocean bottom using either chains, nylon, or buoyant polypropylene. With the decline of the weather ship, they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean helped study the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation. Moored weather buoys range from in diameter, while drifting buoys are smaller, with diameters of . Drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number, with 1250 located worldwide. Wind data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships. There are differences in the values of sea surface temperature measurements between the two platforms as well, relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity. History Weather Buoy / Data Buoy / Oceanographic Buoy operated by the Marine Data Service The first known proposal for surface weather observations at sea occurred in connection with aviation in August 1927, when Grover Loening stated that \\"weather stations along the ocean coupled with the development of the seaplane to have an equally long range, would result in regular ocean flights within ten years.\\" Starting in 1939, United States Coast Guard vessels were being used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce. During World War II The German Navy deployed weather buoys (Wetterfunkger√§t See ‚Äî WFS) at fifteen fixed positions in the North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by the length of the anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self- destructed. The Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device (NOMAD) buoy's hull was originally designed in the 1940s for the United States Navy‚Äôs offshore data collection program. The United States Navy tested marine automatic weather stations for hurricane conditions between 1956 and 1958, though radio transmission range and battery life was limited. Between 1951 and 1970, a total of 21 NOMAD buoys were built and deployed at sea. Since the 1970s, weather buoy use has superseded the role of weather ships, as they are cheaper to operate and maintain. The earliest reported use of drifting buoys was to study the behavior of ocean currents within the Sargasso Sea in 1972 and 1973. Drifting buoys have been used increasingly since 1979, and as of 2005, 1250 drifting buoys roamed the Earth's oceans. Between 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean to monitor and help predict the El Ni√±o phenomenon. Hurricane Katrina capsized a buoy for the first time in the history of the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) on August 28, 2005. On June 13, 2006, drifting buoy 26028 ended its long-term data collection of sea surface temperature after transmitting for 10 years, 4 months, and 16 days, which is the longest known data collection time for any drifting buoy. The first weather buoy in the Southern Ocean was deployed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) on March 17, 2010. Instrumentation Weather buoys, like other types of weather stations, measure parameters such as air temperature above the ocean surface, wind speed (steady and gusting), barometric pressure, and wind direction. Since they lie in oceans and lakes, they also measure water temperature, wave height, and dominant wave period. Raw data is processed and can be logged on board the buoy and then transmitted via radio, cellular, or satellite communications to meteorological centers for use in weather forecasting and climate study. Both moored buoys and drifting buoys (drifting in the open ocean currents) are used. Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of . Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies. These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution. Other than their use as a source of meteorological data, their data is used within research programs, emergency response to chemical spills, legal proceedings, and engineering design. Moored weather buoys can also act as a navigational aid, like other types of buoys. Types Types of moored buoys used by the National Data Buoy Center Weather buoys range in diameter from . Those that are placed in shallow waters are smaller in size and moored using only chains, while those in deeper waters use a combination of chains, nylon, and buoyant polypropylene. Since they do not have direct navigational significance, moored weather buoys are classed as special marks under the IALA scheme, are coloured yellow, and display a yellow flashing light at night. Discus buoys are round and moored in deep ocean locations, with a diameter of . The aluminum buoy is a very rugged meteorological ocean platform that has long term survivability. The expected service life of the platform is in excess of 20 years and properly maintained, these buoys have not been retired due to corrosion. The NOMAD is a unique moored aluminum environmental monitoring buoy designed for deployments in extreme conditions near the coast and across the Great Lakes. NOMADs moored off the Atlantic Canadian coast commonly experience winter storms with maximum wave heights approaching into the Gulf of Maine. 12-meter discus buoys Drifting Buoy (DBi) Drifting buoys are smaller than their moored counterparts, measuring in diameter. They are made of plastic or fiberglass, and tend to be either bi-colored, with white on one half and another color on the other half of the float, or solidly black or blue. It measures a smaller subset of meteorological variables when compared to its moored counterpart, with a barometer measuring pressure in a tube on its top. They have a thermistor (metallic thermometer) on its base, and an underwater drogue, or sea anchor, located below the ocean surface connected with the buoy by a long, thin tether. Deployment and maintenance NOAA buoy in storage, Homer, Alaska A large network of coastal buoys near the United States is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center, with deployment and maintenance performed by the United States Coast Guard. For South Africa, the South African Weather Service deploys and retrieves their own buoys, while the Meteorological Service of New Zealand performs the same task for their country. Environment Canada operates and deploys buoys for their country. The Met Office in Great Britain deploys drifting buoys across both the northern and southern Atlantic oceans. Comparison to data from ships Wind reports from moored buoys have smaller error than those from ships. Complicating the comparison of the two measurements are that NOMAD buoys report winds at a height of , while ships report winds from a height of . Sea surface temperature measured in the intake port of large ships have a warm bias of around due to the heat of the engine room. This bias has led to changes in the perception of global warming since 2000. Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of .

It is based at Dover Air Force Base near Dover, Delaware. The squadron operates Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircraft supporting the United States Air Force global reach mission worldwide. History =World War II= The squadron goes back to the days of World War II when it was activated at Pope Field, North Carolina, in March 1942, as the 3rd Air Corps Ferrying Squadron. Two months later, the 3rd moved to India, where it was stationed at Chabua Airfield, Upper Assam, India. It was part of the India-China Wing of Air Transport Command and carried supplies and equipment back and forth across The Hump. The squadron was disbanded in late 1943. =Strategic airlift= Douglas C-74 Globemaster 42-65402, 3rd ATS, early 1950s During the Korean War, the 3rd was reconstituted at Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama as the 3rd Air Transport Squadron, and began flying regularly scheduled airlift missions in its eight Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs to the Arctic, Caribbean, and South America. In June 1958, the squadron moved to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, where it continued to fly C-124s until August 1965, when it transitioned into jets with the arrival of the first Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. Redesignated the 3rd Military Airlift Squadron on 8 Jan 1966. In June 1970, the squadron, now the 3rd Military Airlift Squadron received the first operational Lockheed C-5 Galaxy to be assigned to a Military Airlift Command (MAC) flying organization. Three years later, the 3rd moved to its present home with the 436th Airlift Wing at Dover Air Force Base. Aircrews of the 3rd flew support missions for French troops in the Zaire peacekeeping effort. For their efforts, they were co-recipients with a 9th Military Airlift Squadron crew of the Mackay Trophy for the 1978 airlift operation. The 3rd proved itself and the C-5 by setting MAC records for departure reliability. In 1986, the 3rd received the 436th Military Airlift Wing's Flying Eagle award four times for having the highest percentage of on-time departures in the wing. In April 1988, a 3d crew, overcoming the difficulties of flying into unfamiliar territory, airlifted drilling equipment into Semipalitinsk, in the Soviet Union. The mission was part of a joint nuclear weapons detonation monitoring agreement signed by the United States and the Soviet Union. The crew was subsequently awarded the Mackay Trophy for the \\"most meritorious flight of the year\\". Redesignated the 3rd Airlift Squadron on 1 Dec 1991. The 3rd continues its distinct history and support of Air Mobility Command by flying humanitarian and contingency missions into such places as Southwest Asia, Somalia, Rwanda, and Haiti. The squadron participated in the first-ever six-ship formation flights of C-5's in support of the Strategic Brigade Airdrop Test. In October 2003 a crew from the 3rd Airlift Squadron landed the first Galaxy in Iraq at Baghdad International Airport. Until 2004 the unit was also the only Special Operations Low Level capable unit to fly the C-5 Galaxy. In March 2007 the 3rd Squadron transitioned from operation of the C-5 to the newer Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The 3rd Airlift Squadron was awarded the prestigious General Joseph Smith Trophy for 2009 when they were judged to be the best airlift squadron in Air Mobility Command. September 2017, saw the 3rd AS deploy to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to deliver much needed humanitarian supplies to the islands following the devastating Hurricanes Irma and Maria. September 2019, the squadron took part in Mobility Guardian 2019. Exercise Mobility Guardian is Air Mobility Command's premier, large-scale mobility exercise that took place that year at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington.

Publication history The first appearance of the first Brothers Grimm came in Spider-Woman #3. These were a pair of identical, magically animated mannequins created by doll collector Nathan Dolly (also known as Mister Doll) and his wife Priscilla. During their initial appearances only one was ever seen at a time and the singular identity, Brother Grimm was used instead of their true plural name. After three return appearances in Spider-Woman, they perished in issue #12. Although the characters were introduced while Marv Wolfman was writing Spider- Woman, their origin and identities were not revealed until Mark Gruenwald's run on the series. Questioned as to whether he had told Gruenwald the characters' origin or Gruenwald had come up with it himself, Wolfman admitted that he could not even remember if the origin he had originally envisioned for the characters was the same as the one ultimately used by Gruenwald, except that \\"Brother Grimm\\" actually being two people was his intention from the beginning. Though Wolfman could not remember how the Brothers Grimm were created, he has said he is confident that their visual design must have come from series penciler Carmine Infantino: \\"I usually gave the artist a concept of what I wanted and then let them have a field day with it. Carmine created brilliant designs in The Flash, so I would certainly have bowed to his expertise.\\" The second Brothers Grimm appeared in Iron Man #188. They would eventually be thrown together with other lesser known super-villains in a group called the Night Shift. Fictional character biography =First Pair= Mister Doll was a criminal who could mystically harm a person by harming a doll whose features he could reshape to resemble the victim's.Tales of Suspense #48 Later, in the process of creating the Brothers Grimm dolls, Nathan's consciousness was trapped simultaneously inside both doll mannequins. These mannequins mailed themselves to Nathan's wife Priscilla and transferred their life forces into two life size versions. She named them Jake and William (after the historical Brothers Grimm), and believed them to be her sons, a delusion which they played along with. The \\"brothers\\" had sharply opposed personalities, rarely could come to agreement, and as such pursued separate criminal careers. William, though timid and shy in his civilian personality, was a flamboyant, confrontational jokester in his Brother Grimm guise. After debuting with a robbery of a theatre, he pursued the more lucrative pursuit of stealing from diamond merchants. In contrast, Jake was flirtatious in his civilian identity but cold and dispassionate as Brother Grimm, preferring less publicly visible crimes such as extortion. He was also less skilled with his abilities than William; while William was able to consistently defeat Spider- Woman, Jake was defeated in both his confrontations with her, and William had to free him from prison.Spider-Woman #3-4 William was later hired by Pyrotechnics to capture Spider-Woman, and succeeded.Spider-Woman #7 Priscilla planned to use her occult knowledge to transfer Nathan's mind from the mannequins to a living human body. To this end, Jake abducted Jerry Hunt to use for the body, and William captured Spider-Woman to coerce Magnus the Sorcerer to perform the transfer.Spider-Woman #11 Spider-Woman pulled Hunt out of the spell at the last moment, and Nathan's consciousness dispersed.Spider- Woman #12 =Second pair= Twin brothers Percy and Barton Grimes are born in Fresno, California. They work as realtors, and while exploring a theatre they own, they find the original Brothers Grimm mannequins. On a whim, they decide to try the costumes on and become gifted with the powers of the original pair. As the Brothers Grimm, they terrorize a restaurant belonging to a business rival, and then battle Iron Man II. Tony Stark deduced their true civilian identities, and the police arrested the brothers.Iron Man #187-188 The Brothers Grimm later became professional criminals, and join the Night Shift, and team with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates.Captain America #330-331 With the rest of the Night Shift, the Brothers test Moon Knight to take over as their leader.Solo Avengers #3 Alongside the Night Shift, they next battle the West Coast Avengers.West Coast Avengers #40 The Brothers Grimm are among a large group of supervillains who attack Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and Trick Shot in an attempt to collect the reward being paid by Crossfire to the first person who gives him Hawkeye's arm.Avengers Spotlight #22, 24-25 During the \\"Acts of Vengeance\\" storyline, the Brothers Grimm are freed from prison by the Wizard.

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Both pairs of Brothers Grimm had powers which were somehow related to the Brothers Grimm mannequins built by Nathan Dolly. Both pairs of Brothers Grimm possess the ability to conjure, with the appearance of sleight of hand, a variety of small novelty items from within their costumes. Each of these items has a unique offensive capability; long strands of nearly unbreakable thread, corrosive filled eggs, pies filled with blackbirds, paralytic \\"stardust\\", fast-growing bean seeds, and many others have been used. They could also emit poisonous smoke from their hands. They could fly by means of floating five-pointed \\"stars\\" and small cloud banks which are somehow solid enough to stand on.

The operation aimed to help Nationalist China resist the invasion of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was part of the Soviet anti-imperialist effort worldwide. In addition, the Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan had a longstanding rivalry that sometimes resulted in open hostilities. Under Operation Zet, the Soviets provided China with warplanes, bombers, tanks, antiaircraft weapons, ammunition, and transport vehicles.

(1616 ‚Äì 27 August 1679) was a Jesuit Catholic priest and martyr who was also known as Charles Baker. Lewis was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970 as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales and is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church.  Early life  Lewis, the youngest of nine children of Anglican Reverend Morgan Lewis, the headmaster of a grammar school, and Margaret Pritchard, a Catholic, was born at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, then in England, in 1616. At 16 years of age, while visiting Paris, he converted to Catholicism from Anglicanism and subsequently went to study at the English College, Rome, where he assumed the alias \\"Charles Baker\\", a common practice among Catholic priests to avoid spies and informers in the employ of the Crown. He was ordained a Catholic priest on 20 July 1642. Three years later, he joined the Society of Jesus. He came back to his native place and worked for a year and then he was appointed \\"the Spiritual Director to the seminarians at the English College\\" in Rome. After his mission in Rome had been completed he came back to Monmouthshire (then in England) and was working for 30 years in the apostolate paying much attention to the poor people and people in need.and martyrs Retrieved on 17 Jan 2018  Arrest and execution  Oil painting after the engraving, Llantarnam Abbey He was arrested on 17 November 1678 at St Michael's Church, Llantarnam, then in Monmouthshire, and condemned at the Assizes in Monmouth in March 1679 as a Catholic priest and for saying Catholic Masses. He was being accused of attempting to kill Charles II and trying to restore Catholic faith in the land of Wales. He was betrayed by an apostate couple who had been promised an award of 50 pounds for the Jesuit's capture, and another sum of 200 pounds was promised by a Welsh magistrate to those who could help in his exposure.and martyrs Retrieved on 17 Jan 2018 Like John Wall and John Kemble, he was then sent to London to be examined by Titus Oates (the originator of the Popish Plot) and other informers. He was brought for trial at the Lenten Assizes in Monmouth on 16 March 1679. He was brought to the bar on a charge of high treason ‚Äì for having become a Catholic priest and then remaining in England, contrary to the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584. He pleaded not guilty to the charge of being an accessory to the Popish Plot, but five or six witnesses claimed they had seen him say Mass and perform other priestly duties. For this Lewis was found guilty and sentenced to death by Sir Robert Atkyns. The condemned priest was brought to Newgate Prison in London with John Kemble (Herefordshire) and questioned about the \\"plot\\". Oates and his fellow informers William Bedloe, Stephen Dugdale and Miles Prance were unable to prove anything against him. Lord Shaftesbury advised him that if he gave evidence about the \\"plot\\" or renounced his Catholic faith, that his life would be spared and he would be greatly rewarded. Lewis said in his dying speech, \\"discover the plot I could not, as I knew of none; and conform I would not, for it was against my conscience\\". His last words before execution were: Grave of St David Lewis He was brought back to Usk in Monmouthshire for his execution by John Arnold of Monmouthshire, prayed at the Gunter Mansion and was hanged on 27 August 1679 and then posthumously disembowelled. It was a tribute to the esteem in which he was held that the crowd, who were mainly Protestants, insisted that he be allowed to hang until he was dead, and that he receive a proper burial.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p206 The Sheriff, who knew and liked Lewis, refused to attend the execution, which he had postponed for as long as he could.Kenyon p.206 After the Titus Oates affair (1679‚Äì80), the remaining Welsh-speaking Catholic clergy were either executed or exiled. Lewis was the last Welshman (born in Monmouthshire, he would've been English) to become a Jesuit until 2001, more than 300 years later. Recognition Together with John Wall, John Kemble and 37 other martyrs, David Lewis was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970 ‚Äì the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. In November 2007, a plaque was erected on the spot where Lewis was arrested near Llantarnam Abbey. Citations References *Herbermann, Charles, ed (1913). \\"Ven. Charles Baker\\".

It oversees the farming areas in the valley between il-Ballut and il-Manikata. Population 539, Families 40.  Farming  The main industry of Manikata is farming. The valleys around this village are rich in produce. All year round the fields are tended and the produce is enjoyed by many. Grapes, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, melons (bettiegƒß), water melons (dulliegƒß), apples, oranges, pomegranates (rummien), strawberries and many other crops are commonly seen in the fields. Also there are many beekeepers in this area.  Surroundings  = Beaches = Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Bay Literally translates into ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs Spring‚Äù. It is located just east of Golden Bay, one of three bays (Gnejna Bay, Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa & Golden Bay) carved out of the cliffs. It is situated at the bottom of Wied tal-Pwales (Pwales stream.) The sea is deep blue and aquamarine water interspersed with emerald and white stretches of sand. Golden Bay Golden Bay (Il-Mixquqa) is another one of the few sandy beaches located on the southern coast of Malta. The sand at the edge of the water at this bay is peppered with small pebbles and reaching the water can be tricky. The water here can be quite rough at times. As you swim away from the beach, the currents can be quite strong. This is one of the best places for sunsets on the Maltese islands. The water shimmers as the sun hits the horizon. Different periods =Bronze Age= A lot of cart ruts are found around Manikata. These probably date to a period between the Bronze Age and the Roman Era. One particular line of cart ruts surfaces from under the trees in the Mi≈ºieb area, proceeds towards the parish church and goes towards the cliffs hanging above Mejjiesa Bay. =Roman period= In the area of Il-ƒ†nien ta‚Äô Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa there are the remains of Roman baths that formed part of a rural villa. Nearer to Manikata there are several Roman tombs. Some of them have been obliterated when people cut across the cliff side to level the ground and make space for their fields. Other tombs are found in caves and have been modified by subsequent cave inhabitants to be used as storage space. Some tombs were used as air-raid shelters during World War Two. =The Middle Ages= During the Middle Ages, the lands at Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa and Manikata were used for the cultivation of crops and fruit trees. Fields belonged to land owners from the capital city, Mdina, and its suburb, Rabat. The farmers usually inhabited the caves in the vicinity. The caves also housed sheep, goats and oxen. People also used to come here to collect fire wood. A night watch was kept over the sea cliffs of Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa by men from Mosta forming part of the civil corps called Dejma. =The Knights of St. John= On the 18th of May 1565 the Turkish fleet anchored in the bays around Manikata, namely Mejjiesa, Mixquqa (Golden Bay), Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa and ƒ†nejna. The following day it arrived at Marsaxlokk Bay to the South East where Turkish soldiers landed to begin their assault on Birgu, the general headquarters of the Order. In 1637, Grand Master Lascaris came to Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa to lay the foundation stone of Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Tower. Grand Master Lascaris also built other watch towers at ƒ†nejna, Qawra and Binƒ°emma. He also built Saint Agatha's Tower, the red tower dominating Mellieƒßa Bay. Towards the end of the Order‚Äôs reign, coastal entrenchments were built over Mixquqa Bay (Golden Bay), near modern-day Golden Sands Hotel. These were meant to prevent enemy troops from landing on the sandy beach below =The British period= From 1902 onwards, a number of farmers in Manikata and Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa lost a vast amount of agricultural land which was taken over by the Admiralty for the construction of a Royal Marines Training Centre. The Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Camp consisted of shooting ranges and residential quarters for soldiers, their families and camp officials. During World War One (1914-1917) the camp was covered in tents and used as a military hospital to cure wounded soldiers that were brought here from the war front. People from Manikata used to work in this emergency hospital as nurses. In 1935 Benito Mussolini, the Fascist ruler of Italy, invaded Abbisinia (modern Ethiopia) in Africa. The British suspected that Mussolini would attempt to invade Malta. So, they built a number of coastal defences called beach posts. These were built of concrete and camouflaged with rubble walls. Two such beach posts were built in Manikata in 1935, one near Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Tower and one near the Razzett tal-Qasam. When the Second World War eventually broke out, more beach posts were built along the coast. These were provided with a search light in order to spot enemy aircraft. Over Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Gardens, an anti-aircraft battery was also built. Due to the presence of the Admiralty camp, Manikata was often a target during air-raids. The residents used to take shelter in rock-cut air-raid shelters, in caves or in Roman tombs. =Manikata today= Manikata is home to about 1000 inhabitants. New houses, apartments and villas have been built recently. People from different parts of the Maltese islands have come to live here in search of serenity and beautiful surroundings. Many local villagers are full-time or part-time farmers. Their fields are found in the surrounding areas known as il-ƒ†nien ta‚Äô Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa (Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Gardens), il-Wilƒ°a ta‚Äô Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa (Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa meadow), il-Mi≈ºieb (woodland) and ix-Xagƒßra l-ƒ¶amra (The red garrigue). Every last Sunday in August the parish celebrates the feast of St.Joseph. On the eve of the parish feast, the local community celebrates Lejla Sajfija gƒßa≈º-≈ªiffa, a Summer Breeze Night, where the villagers put their best talents and products on show, including songs, drama, paintings, hand crafts, vegetables, fruits, honey, wine, olive oil...  Historical structures  =Bronze Age defensive walls= In the north-east of the Manikata church there is a medium barren land called Tal-Qargƒßa. This land contains a number of archaeological remains mainly cart-ruts, old quarry and walls built of large stones. In the land there is a girna and in the west of the structure there is a wall some 8 metres long and in it there are five large stones. Parallel to this wall there is another wall, which has six large stones. On top of the hill there is another wall and it there are three large stones, the largest one is 0.75m length and 0.6m breath. Apart from this wall there are another two built from large stones. It seems that during the Bronze Age period in this area there was a prehistoric village and it was defended by several walls against their enemies. The idea of building a village on a hill and surround it by a defensive wall is a typical characteristic of the Bronze Age Period, Borƒ° in-Nadur. This site has evidence of hut foundations and has the longest defensive wall of the Bronze Age Period. Borƒ° in-Nadur wall is the best preserved prehistoric fortification in Malta. =Pillbox= A pillbox can be found built in Manikata at the rear of Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Camp. Pillboxes were the last type of fortification to be built in Mellieƒßa and Malta. These types of military structures were constructed in nearly every part of the Island. It seems that the largest number of pillboxes was built in Mellieƒßa and fortunately the largest number of them survived to this day. The first building programme of pillboxes occurred in 1935. =Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Tower= Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Tower was built in 1637, on the top of the cliffs at the western edge of Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Bay. During the Middle Ages il-Mahras maintained a watch-post in Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa, probably in the same site where the tower was built. This is one of the seven towers built by Grand Master Lascaris, during the times of the Knights of Malta. This tower has a longish shape and the ground floor room is larger than the second floor one. It was armed with ¬Ω-pdr cannon and was manned by four men, a captain and three men. Unfortunately, the cliffs around this Tower are eroding very badly. Serious cracks are visible on the surface of the cliffs near the Tower and huge holes can be seen on the wall of the cliffs. This tower may eventually collapse when the terrain on which it's built gives in.  Church of St. Joseph  Manikata Parish Church The Old Chapel of St. Joseph was built in 1920, when there were only twelve families living in Manikata. A number of people from this tiny village helped to build this chapel. Locals recall how the soft, honey- coloured stone was brought from Qasam Barrani quarry, while stronger stone, for the arches was brought from quarries in the north of Mosta. But with the growth of Manikata to over five hundred people the chapel of St. Joseph, which seated only 100, became too small for the religious needs of the locals. In 1961, it was decided to build a new and larger church, the rector Fr. Manwel Grima approached architect Edwin England Sant Fournier to prepare a design for the new church. However, shortly afterwards Edwin handed over the job to his son Richard England. The building of the new church of Manikata faced numerous problems. In 1962 the first stone was laid by Archbishop Sir Michael Gonzi, but after the death of Fr. Grima the church remained half built for five years. Finally Manikata‚Äôs new church was finished and blessed on 29 November 1974 by Archbishop Sir Michael Gonzi, more than ten years after he officially had laid the first stone. The architect Richard England, who built the church took his inspiration from the \\"girna\\" which one sometimes sees in the middle of a field, a small stone building put up by farmers to store in it their implements. Military camps On the outskirts of Manikata there were two military camps in the 1960s. One was home to Royal Malta Artillery and the other was a British Army camp which hosted many different regiments including the Royal Marines. These army camps are no longer active.

The paramilitary groups commanded by Mancuso fought the guerrillas (mainly EPL, FARC and ELN), and financed their activities by receiving donations from land owners, drug trafficking, extortions and robbery. The AUC committed numerous atrocities and massacres against presumed guerrilla members and the civilian population. Mancuso was initially jailed in a Maximum Security Prison in Itag√º√≠, Antioquia after a peace process that led to his demobilization and then transferred to a prison in the city of C√∫cuta to help establish the whereabouts of some of the victims. In a surprise move by the Colombian government, Mancuso, along with 13 other top members of the AUC was extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges.  Early years and education  Mancuso was born in Monter√≠a, the provincial capital of C√≥rdoba Department, in the northern Colombian Caribbean Region. His father was an Italian immigrant from Sapri and his mother a Monter√≠a native. He is the second of six children. He studied civil engineering in the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and later farming administration in the Escuela de Formaci√≥n T√©cnica Agr√≠cola in Bogot√°. He also studied English at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.S. Mancuso: Autobiography, published in his personal site, link checked on May 7, 2007.  Paramilitary leader  He became a prominent landowner in C√≥rdoba Department and in 1995 he joined the \\"Autodefensas Campesinas de C√≥rdoba y Urab√°\\" paramilitary group, citing being tired of guerrilla extortion and abuses that the Colombian authorities failed to prosecute. The attacks by the guerrillas to the estate owners in the region brought as a consequence the formation of illegally armed self-defense groups to confront them. This new movement had the sympathy of some sectors of the Colombian Government such as politicians and some security forces, including then-current and former members of the Colombian National Army. The group was originally under the command of Carlos Casta√±o, with Mancuso as his main Lieutenant. The paramilitary groups in Colombia later expanded, and in April 1997 created what was known as \\"Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia\\" (AUC), an umbrella organization under the leadership of the \\"Autodefensas Campesinas de C√≥rdoba y Urab√°\\" led by Mancuso and Casta√±o. Following the death of Casta√±o,apparently because of internal power struggles in his organization, Mancuso became the strong man, along with Casta√±o's brother Vicente and, consequently, the main leader in the peace process with the Colombian government of president √Ålvaro Uribe. His name has been involved in the command of at least eight paramilitary groups that perpetrated several massacres such as Mapirip√°n. On September 24, 2002 Salvatore Mancuso and Juan Carlos Sierra Ramirez were formally charged by the Colombian and the American governments for narcotrafficking.US Department of Justice: Remarks of Attorney General John Ashcroft - AUC Indictment Press Conference The US Government applied for his extradition to the United States in order to be judged by an American court. Marcuso was so unconcerned about it that he attended the ceremony of the \\"Bloque Bananero\\"'s demobilization, following the peace process with the Colombian State on November 24, 2004. The extradition application was initially accepted by government of Colombia, but soon was suspended to complete the demobilization process of the AUC. Mancuso demobilized officially and surrendered to the Colombian authorities in the \\"Bloque Catatumbo\\"'s demobilization ceremony on December 10, 2006. Gonzo author Matthew Thompson describes his 2006 meeting with Mancuso in Monter√≠a in My Colombian Death (2008). On January 15, 2007, Mancuso admitted his crimes to a Colombian court following a deal that his attorneys were pursuing to preclude his extradition to the United States for drug trafficking. According to the country's Justice and Peace Law, Mancuso should reveal trafficking routes and drug contacts in order to completely fulfill the deal. During his Colombian imprisonment, Mancuso had his own website and criticized the Colombian government, led by √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez on numerous occasions. Many politicians, members of the National Army and government officials, he claimed, had links with the AUC.  Extradition to the United States  In the early morning of May 13, 2008, Mancuso and thirteen other paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the Colombian government. According to Colombian Interior Minister Carlos Holgu√≠n they had been refusing to comply to the country's Peace and Justice law and were therefore extradited to the United States. During his first appearance before the District of Columbia Court, Mancuso refused to speak after having said his name. His lawyer pleaded not guilty for him. The National Movement of State Crimes, a coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked \\"to return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace, since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures.\\" Extradition Cut Short ‚Äò‚ÄôCCAJAR‚Äô‚Äô May 27, 2008 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia stated that \\"[...] according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously-suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the ‚ÄòLaw of Justice and Peace‚Äô and for the loss of the benefits established therein\\". The Inter-American Commission stated that this \\"affects the Colombian State's obligation to guarantee victims‚Äô rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system's regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders.\\". A 2016 investigation by the New York Times found that the extradited paramilitaries, including Mancuso, had been given special treatment by the US justice system, serving shorter sentences than would be expected for drug-trafficking offences of that magnitude; a number of judges and prosecutors involved in trying the cases publicly stated their admiration for the political cause of the AUC, which they saw as a mitigating factor.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/world/americas/colombia-cocaine- human-rights.html After his extradition to the United States, Colombian paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso has continued to testify via satellite as part of the Justice and Peace process. On November 18, 2008, Revista Semana reported on Mancuso's declarations about the 1997 El Aro massacre, in which he stated that the AUC had received logistical help from the Colombian military and police. Marcuso was released from prison in March 2020 after serving 12 of his 15-year sentence. The government of Colombia fears he will be deported to Italy, where he is a citizen, and escape justice for the more than 1,000 murders he committed. Marcuso's have suggested he might be killed if he were sent to Colombia. Colombia and Italy do not have an extradition treaty. Venezuela operations Mancuso testified that in the early 2000s, the AUC had met with anti-Chavez factions in Venezuela to discuss the AUC possibly operating against the Chavez government.  Accumulated wealth  Immediately after his extradition Colombian police seized Mancuso's luxury ranches, farms and plots of land, with a combined property value of US$25 million. On June 5, 2008 Several Colombian media reported police in Monter√≠a found a suitcase allegedly containing Mancuso's shadow administration, revealing more property owned by the warlord through secret associates.

Lyman Run Lake is a man-made lake within the park, surrounded by a northern hardwood forest of mainly maple and cherry trees. Lyman Run State Park is west of Galeton and east of Coudersport, and is nearly completely surrounded by the Susquehannock State Forest. History =Major Isaac Lyman= Lyman Run State Park is named for the creek that runs through it, which is dammed to form Lyman Run Lake. Major Isaac Lyman, an American Revolutionary War veteran was one of the first permanent settlers in Potter County. Major Lyman is recognized as the founder of Potter County. He was paid ten dollars for each settler that he convinced to move to Potter County. He built his home in 1809 in nearby Lymansville, now known as Ladonna. Major Lyman also built the first road to cross Potter County and the county's first sawmill and gristmill. Lyman had a colorful personal history. Isaac was married three times and had 17 children. His first wife (Sally Edgecomb Lyman) died in 1791. He divorced his second wife (Laura Pierce Lyman) and started a third family in Potter County with his third wife (Patience Mann Spafford Lyman). The second Mrs. Lyman was determined not to suffer on her own. She sought out the Major, traveled to Potter County, with the help of her son, Burrell who was 18 at the time, and settled. Major Lyman lived with his two families in Potter County. Historical accounts of the living situation vary. Some say that Lyman kept both wives under one roof. Others state that there were two log homes for the families on the same piece of property. The descendants of Major Isaac Lyman still live and work in Potter County. =The lumber era= The Lyman Run area was part of the massive lumbering operation that occurred in most of north central Pennsylvania in the 1880s and 1890s. The land near Lyman Run was purchased by Frank and Charles Goodyear. The Goodyear brothers owned a railroad and lumber company that harvested the old-growth white pine and hemlock. These logs were floated down Lyman Run to the log boom at Williamsport by way of the West Branch of Pine Creek, then Pine Creek itself, and finally the West Branch Susquehanna River. =Modern era= In the 1930s, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was built at what later became Lyman Run State Park. The grounds of the former CCC camp became a prisoner of war camp toward the end of World War II, with German prisoners of war detained by the U.S. Military there. In 1951, construction began on the state park facilities. In 2000 the park became part of the Hills Creek State Park complex, an administrative grouping of eight state parks in Potter and Tioga counties. Note: the eight parks in the Hills Creek State Park Complex are Cherry Springs, Colton Point, Denton Hill, Hills Creek, Leonard Harrison, Lyman Run, Patterson, and Prouty Place. Recreation =Camping, picnics, and hiking= Camping at both modern and rustic campsites is available at Lyman Run State Park. There are twenty-nine campsites equipped with electricity for RV's. Each site has a fire ring, picnic table and lantern hanger. There is a sanitary dump station at the campground. Those interested in camping out in tents may use one of six walk- in rustic camping areas. These locations have outhouses and hand-operated water pumps. The entrance sign for Lyman Run State Park In addition to the picnic tables at the campsites, Lyman Run State Park has a central, shaded picnic area. There are charcoal grills, outhouses, and a play area. Drinking water is available at hand-operated pumps. There is one picnic pavilion on the grounds. Lyman Run State Park has of hiking trails, which connect with the much larger system of trails in the adjoining Susquehannock State Forest. It is a northern access point for the Susquehannock Trail System (STS), an loop trail almost entirely on state forest land. The STS runs west of the park, and is reached via an access trail from the southwest end of the lake. =Hunting= Hunting is permitted on about of Lyman Run State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and black bears. The hunting of groundhogs is not permitted at the park. Many more acres of forested woodlands are available for hunting on the grounds of the adjacent Susquehannock State Forest. =Lyman Run Lake= Boating with gas powered motors is prohibited on Lyman Run Lake. Motorized boats must be powered by electric motors only. Rowboats, canoes and kayaks are permitted on the waters of the lake. All boats must be properly registered with the state. Lyman Run Lake is a popular fishing lake, with exceptional water quality. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat commission stocks the lake with rainbow and palomino trout during the fishing season. In winter, ice fishing for trout is permitted. The thickness of the ice is not monitored, but should be at least thick before venturing out on it. Ice skating is allowed when the ice is thick enough, but limited to the beach area. Swimming is permitted in Lyman Run Lake. The swimming season opens on Memorial Day weekend and concludes on Labor Day weekend. Beginning in 2008 lifeguards will not be posted at the beach.

It is owned by Macerich, and was developed by Westcor. The anchors at the mall are Dillard's, JCPenney, and Macy's. The mall also has Picture Show as a junior anchor and a freestanding Cheesecake Factory. The mall features an outdoor amphitheatre and a fountain that converts into a stage featuring free concerts from May to August on Saturday evenings. History Superstition Springs Center was built and completed in 1990, and was jointly developed and owned by Westcor and General Growth Properties. The original architect was Rafique Islam. When it first opened, most of the area surrounding the mall was open fields. At the time, it rested at the end of a freeway (U.S. Route 60), and was considered too far away from developed areas to be successful. However, since its opening, the area around Superstition Springs Center has seen significant growth; as of 2009, it held an estimated population of 337,000 in its primary trade area. In February 2002, the mall underwent remodeling to include exterior paint and lighting, interior paint, flooring, and lighting to create a new refined atmosphere with color, texture and regional imagery. Originally majority owned and managed by Westcor (two-thirds share, with General Growth Properties owning the other third), in 2002 Superstition Springs Center became part of Macerich's portfolio, with Westcor kept as management. In June 2011, GGP sold its 1/3 ownership in the mall (along with its 1/3 ownership of Arrowhead Towne Center in Glendale), with Westcor assuming full ownership.  Anchors  The anchors at the mall are Dillard's, JCPenney, and Macy's The Macy's location was built to be Broadway Southwest (the last store built by then owner Carter Hawley Hale). This location was halted during a hostile take over attempt by the Limited and sold off to Robinsons-May in 1994. In 2010, the former Mervyn's became a furniture store called Home Sleep Home,https://www.azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/2010/02/19/20100219mr- furniture0220.html which went out of business. It was then divided up into two junior anchors. The lower level was replaced with a miniature golf course called Lunar Mini Golf and later Phoenix Sofa Factory. Phoenix Sofa Factory closed in October 2017, leaving the lower level vacant.http://www.superstitionsprings.com/Shopping/Details/183987 The upper level became Sports Authority, which went out of business in 2016, and became Book Vault a year later. Book Vault closed on October 28, 2018.https://www.facebook.com/AZBookVault/posts/2003292649716556 In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Superstition Springs Center, into Seritage Growth Properties.http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/6515-e-southern- ave/3312439/landing On October 15, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide.https://www.12news.com/mobile/article/news/local/arizona/sears- bankruptcy-5-more-arizona-locations-closing/75-604485761 Part of the former auto center is expected to become Blink Fitness.

Ury House, currently in the advanced stages of redevelopment. Ury House is a large ruined mansion in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, built in the Elizabethan style in 1885 by Sir Alexander Baird, 1st Baronet. It is situated on the north-east coast about north of Stonehaven in the former county of Kincardineshire. Pre-history Bronze Age cists have been found at the site of the Ury House. Roman legions marched from Raedykes to Normandykes Roman Camp nearby as they used higher ground evading the bogs of Red Moss and low-lying mosses associated with the Burn of Muchalls. That march used the Elsick Mounth, one of the ancient trackways crossing the Mounth of the Grampian Mountains,C. Michael Hogan, Elsick Mounth, Megalithic Portal, editor: Andy Burnham (2007) lying west of Netherley. History Originally the estate belonged to the Frasers, then the Hays starting in 1413, but eventually became the property of the Earl Marischal. Colonel David Barclay purchased Urie in a lengthy process in the late 1660s and his descendants owned it through 1854 when the estate was purchased by the Baird family.(source Clan Barclay and newspaper archives Stonehaven). The second laird was his son, Robert Barclay the Quaker apologist. It descended to Robert Barclay Allardice (1732-1797) and then to his son Captain Robert Barclay Allardice, the celebrated pedestrian. Over the years Ury has been rebuilt three times. In early times the property was known as Urie. In the 17th century Ury was established as the North East Scotland headquarters of the Quaker organisation by David Barclay. Current status Today the house is derelict and the dangerous condition of the structure limits entry. In March 2007, FM Developments lodged an amended planning application for a golf and leisure complex on the estate as the previous housing development was rejected in October 2006. There have been earlier proposals for its restoration, including a 2004 planning application, which was rejected by the local Community Council. The estate in now owned by The FM Group who have recently lodged a planning application to Aberdeenshire Council for the creation of a world-class 18-hole Jack Nicklaus Signature Championship Golf Course as part of the redevelopment of Ury Estate. In early 2019, plans for a housing development in the grounds (3 houses and 58 three-storey flats) were approved by Aberdeenshire Council along with the conversion of Ury House into an hotel. Nearby historic features There are several notable historic structures and sites close to the Ury House, including: * Fetteresso Castle * Muchalls Castle * Raedykes Roman Camp * Rickarton House Natural features Ury Estate is bounded on the west by Fetteresso Forest. Within about 150 metres south of Ury House is the confluence of the Burn of Monboys into the Cowie Water. Cowie Water has generally alkaline pH as tested at the perimeter of the Ury Estate, although its pH is somewhat lower above the confluence with the Burn of Monboys, explained by Lumina Tech as due to more acidic drainage from upland moorland peat areas in the Burn of Monboys watershed.C.M.

Nowadays, Ciudad Vieja is a barrio (neighbourhood or district) of this city. In the last couple of years it has gone through a major transformation that has made it the main nightlife centre in town. It is in this area where most of the nightclubs are, and also it hosts the 'Mercado del Puerto' a traditional venue for Uruguayan food and beverages. The main port of Uruguay (being the main Big Draft port in southern South America) is located in Ciudad Vieja. Part of this transformation is due to the campaign made by the mayor since this part of the city had been in a state of abandonment for decades.  Early history  Until 1829 it was surrounded by a wall that protected it from possible invasions. After the wall was torn down, the only part of it that was kept was its gateway, which is up to this day an emblem of this part of town. Some streets recall the presence of the wall, like Ciudadela (citadel) or Brecha (breach), which has this name because it was near but at this point that the British managed to open a breach on the wall during the 1807 British invasion. The old street Sarand√≠ was turned into a pedestrian walkway in 1992, which increased its commercial and tourist attractiveness. In 2005 it was extended to beyond the Constitution Square. Ciudad Vieja has elegant buildings from the colonial era and the first decades of independence. The Cabildo (built between 1804 and 1812), the Sol√≠s Theatre, the Metropolitan Cathedral and several museums, like the Museo Torres Garc√≠aTorres Garcia Museum are among the most impressive ones. Also several design shops and recycled loft floors flourish in the streets near the port.  Places of worship  Several temples have been built in the historic heart of the city: * Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, St. Philip and St. James (head of the Roman Catholic Church in Uruguay) * Parish Church of St. Francis of Assisi (Roman Catholic) * Church of Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Vincent Pallotti (Roman Catholic, Pallottines) * Charity Chapel, Maciel Hospital (Roman Catholic, Hospitaller Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) * Cathedral of The Most Holy Trinity, popularly known as the English Temple (Anglican) * Sephardic Jewish Community (Synagogue)Jewish Tourism in Uruguay - Temples  Government and infrastructure  The National Meat Institute (INAC), a government agency, has its headquarters here.\\"foot.gif .\\" National Meat Institute.

Often, allusions were also made to the great liberty of the United States of America and the possible support for Lower Canada that could arise in the neighbouring republic. The American Revolution was indeed a major influence of the Patriote movement and its rebellion. Ultimately, the United States would be of little help to the coming Lower Canada Rebellion, despite plans by American northeastern citizens to provide weapons and the passive role that country played hosting the Fr√®res chasseurs and the hunted and banished Patriotes (notably Papineau). They eventually proclaimed their neutrality and, in January 1838, American President Martin Van Buren even cautioned Americans against any assistance or protection, declaring that anyone who would compromise the neutrality of the United States would expose themselves to arrestation and punishment.Canada ‚Äì Qu√©bec by Jacques Lacoursi√®re, Jean Provenche and Denis Vaugeois, √âditions du Septentrion, Sillery, Quebec, p.249,  References   See also  *List of the public meetings held in Lower Canada between May and November 1837 *Quebec nationalism *Quebec independence movement *History of Quebec *Timeline of Quebec history Category:1837 conferences Category:1837 in Canada Category:Lower Canada Rebellion Category:Patriote movement ","title":"Patriote popular assemblies"},{"id":"7701053","text":"The 607th Weather Squadron (607 WS) of the U.S. Air Force has overall responsibility for planning, providing, and/or arranging weather support for the United States Army during armistice conditions in Korea. 607 WS and elements of the US Navy and US Marines support the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) Weather Wing, Combined Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Officer (CMO) and subordinate squadrons during exercises and contingencies. The 607 WS commander is also the Joint METOC Officer (JMO) and the senior US METOC officer (SMO) for the Korean Theater of Operations (KTO). History Following the conclusion of World War II, Korean weather support was managed by the 20th Weather Squadron, headquartered in Japan. The lone Air Force weather detachment in Korea was closed in September 1949. Mobile units of the 20th returned to Korea the next year at the start of the Korean War. The 30th Weather Squadron was soon reactivated with its headquarters in Korea to support the Fifth Air Force and other United Nations Forces. Within one month, the unit's headquarters were forced to retreat south from Seoul to Taegu. It remained in Taegu until July 1951, when it returned to Seoul. In 1954, the headquarters moved to Osan Air Base. After the end of the Korean War, the 30th Weather Squadron began to turn over several of its locations to the Republic of Korea (ROK) Air Force. In 1957, headquarters of the 30th moved from Korea to Japan, to oversee the weather detachments in Korea and Japan with the inactivation of the 20th Weather Squadron. In 1957, the 30th was assigned to the 10th Weather Group. In 1959, the 30th was inactivated and its detachments assigned directly to the 10th Weather Group. The 10th Weather Group was inactivated in 1960. From 1960 to 1964, the remaining USAF weather units in Korea reported directly to the First Weather Wing located at Hickam AFB, Hawaii. In 1964, the 20th Weather Squadron was reactivated at Fuchu Air Station, Japan, and again took responsibility for managing the USAF weather units in Korea. In 1974, 20th Weather Squadron headquarters moved to Yokota AB, Japan, and continued to manage USAF weather support in Korea until it was inactivated on 1 September 1976. On that date, the 30th Weather Squadron was reactivated at Yongsan Army Garrison, Seoul, and all USAF weather units on the Korean peninsula were placed under the squadron's control. The 30th Weather Squadron managed all US weather support in Korea until 1992. In 1992, the US Air Force reorganized, placing all support assets under the control of the local Wing Commander. The 30th Weather Squadron was again inactivated, the squadron at Yongsan was redesignated as the 51st Weather Squadron, and weather units at Osan and Kunsan were removed from squadron control and placed under the local USAF Wing Commanders at their respective bases. The 51st Weather Squadron continued to manage weather support to the Commander, United Nations Command, the Commander, Combined Forces Command, the Commander, United States Forces Korea (CDR, USFK), the Commander, Eighth Army (CDR, 8A), and to all US Army units on the peninsula. Because the 51st Weather Squadron was not under the operational control of the 51st Fighter Wing at Osan AB, the decision was made in July 1993 to replace it with the reactivated 5th Weather Squadron, which had a long lineage of battle decorations from the Pacific Theater in World War II and the Vietnam War. Another USAF restructuring of Numbered Air Forces and a drive toward standardized naming conventions caused the Air Force to inactivate the 5th Weather Squadron and to activate the 607th Weather Squadron in December 1994. Today, the 607th Weather Squadron is part of the 607th Air Support Operations Group, 7th Air Force, Pacific Air Forces. In 1999, the 607th Weather Squadron became the USAF's second \\"Weather Hub\\". In this capacity, the squadron was responsible for providing all point and area weather forecasts for US Forces Command forces operating on the Korean Peninsula. The Weather Hub portion of the 607th was decommissioned and moved to Japan in 2003. As part of the Yongsan Relocation Plan Detachment 1, Camp Red Cloud was closed and moved to Camp Humphreys in Nov/Dec 2018. Headquarters 607th Weather Squadron moved from Yongsan Army Garrison in April of 2019 consolidating with Det 2, at Camp Humphreys. Today, the 607th Weather Squadron has 57 personnel assigned to two locations on the Korean Peninsula; K-16 Air Base, Seoul AB East; and USAG-Humphreys, Pyongtaek.

Bourne (2019-Present) Organization The 607 WS is functionally organized to provide weather support to Headquarters, United Nations Command/US Forces Korea (UNC/USFK) and subordinate Air, Ground, Naval, Marine and Special Operations Component Commands. In-theater units provide weather support at 15 locations in the ROK. Five locations support the U.S. Army's 2 Combat Aviation Brigade and 2nd Infantry Division (United States) and three units support combined/joint operations during exercises and contingencies. These units would be augmented by weather forces attached to and supporting inbound combat units in contingencies/war. The 607 WS at (United States Army Garrison) USAG- Humphreys is divided into two main functional areas: Mission Support and Operations. The 607 WS provides weather forecast products for Korea and the adjacent waters. The staff form the nucleus of the Combined Meteorological Forecast Unit (CMFU) during exercises/contingencies. The 607 WS areas of expertise include operations, forecasting, observing, plans, communications, mobility/readiness, security, scientific services, administration, training and logistics. The 607 WS staff provides direct support to the UNC/USFK, the 2nd Infantry Division (2ID), and Eighth Army (8A). They maintain liaison with US Navy weather support activities and also coordinate weather support with the ROKAF Weather Wing (WW) of the ROK Air Force and ROK Navy. In addition they provide briefings, observations, and staff weather support, including limited observing support at H-264 helipad.

Biography Henry Morse was born a Protestant in 1595 at his grandmother's house at Brome in the English county of Suffolk, the son of Robert Morse, a minor landowner of Tivetshall St Mary, Norfolk.Holmes P, ‚ÄòMorse, Henry (1595‚Äì1645)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2012 accessed 2014-03-15. At the age of 16, Henry went to study law at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and continued at Gray's Inn, London. Upon his father's death in 1614, he went to France to join his brother William, who was at Douai studying to be a priest. Morse converted to Roman Catholicism at The English College, Douay. He returned to England to settle some financial arrangements and was arrested at Dover for refusing to take the Oath of allegiance and confined to Southwark gaol. Morse remained incarcerated with a number of priests for four years, until King James I of England ordered amnesty and banishment for about 100 priests, in furtherance of negotiations to arrange a Spanish marriage for his son Prince Charles. He arrived back at Douai in August 1618 and was sent to the English College in Rome to commence his studies. While there, he used the alias \\"Henry Claxon\\" to shield his identity from the Crown's spies. He was ordained at Rome and left for the English Mission on 19 June 1624. Morse was assigned to assist the Jesuits at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where later that year there was an outbreak of plague. Morse and his companions nursed the sick. The following year he was arrested and later moved from Newcastle gaol to York Castle where he again tended the sick. He completed his novitiate under his fellow prisoner, Father John Robinson, and took simple vows as a Jesuit. After three years in prison he was banished from the country and served as a missionary to the English and Irish soldiers attached to the Spanish army in the Low Countries. Returning to England at the end of 1633 he laboured in London, in the St Giles-in-the- Fields area. In 1635 plague was brought on boats from Flanders. Morse himself contracted the illness while nursing the sick, but recovered. Here he worked with John Southworth, raising funds for food and medicine. Arrested 27 February 1636, he was imprisoned in Newgate. On 22 April he was brought to the bar charged with being a priest and having withdrawn the king's subjects from their faith and allegiance. He was found guilty on the first count, not guilty on the second, and sentence was deferred. On 23 April he made his solemn profession of the three vows to Father Edward Lusher. He was released on bail for 10,000 florins, 20 June 1637, at the insistence of Queen Henriette Maria. In order to free his sureties he voluntarily went into exile when the royal proclamation was issued ordering all priests to leave the country before 7 April 1641, and became chaplain to Gage's English regiment in the service of Spain. In 1643 he returned to England; arrested after about a year and a half he was imprisoned at Durham and Newcastle, and sent by sea to London. On 30 January he was again brought to the bar and condemned on his previous conviction. On 1 February 1645 his hurdle was drawn by four horses and the French ambassador attended with all his suite, as also did Lois, Count of Egmont, and the Portuguese Ambassador. Morse was allowed to hang until he was dead. At the quartering the footmen of the French Ambassador and of the Count of Egmont dipped their handkerchiefs into Morse's blood. Venerated from 8 December 1929, and beatified on 15 December 1929, he was named one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales in 1970.Malcolm Pullan (30 April 2008).

He is famous as the commissioner of the Mannerist Park of the Monsters in Bomarzo (northern Lazio). Biography Born in Corigliano Calabro, he was the son of Giovanni Corrado Orsini and Clarice Orsini di Franciotto di Monterotondo, the daughter of Cardinal Franciotto Orsini and Violante di Vicino Orsini di Foglia. ¬´Franciotto Orsini of Monterotondo married Violante Orsini di Castello, daughter of Pierfrancesco I Orsini, also known as Vicino, who was lord of Bomarzo and transmitted the rights to the fief to the daughter. Franciotto was educated with his aunt in the house of Lorenzo and a native of Giovanni de Medici who, once a pope, named the cousin who had just been widowed a cardinal.¬ª Vicino Orsini inherited the duchy of Bomarzo seven years after the death of his father, thanks to an intercession by Alessandro Cardinal Farnese (the future Pope Paul III). He later married Alessandro's relative Giulia Farnese, not to be confused with her maternal great-aunt and the cardinal's sister Giulia Farnese, the mistress of Pope Alexander VI. His wife Giulia Farnese (d. 1564) was the daughter of Galeazzo Farnese, Duke of Latera and Isabella, daughter of Giuliano dell'Anguillara and Girolama Farnese (d. 1504). Giulia's maternal grandmother Girolama Farnese was the sister of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, Pope Paul III, and Giulia Farnese, the mistress of Rodrigo Borgia, Pope Alexander VI. The second Guilia Farnese's paternal great-grandfather was Bartolomeo Farnese, Count of Montalto and Canino, and the brother of Girolama, Alessandro (the future Pope Paul III) and Giulia Farnese. He was born in 1470 and married Iolanda Monaldeschi, with whom he had the son Pedro Bertodolo Farnese and the daughters Isabella and Cecilia. Bartolomeo died in 1552 and was the founder of the Duchy of Latera, which existed until 1668. Her grandmother Girolama was born in 1466 and was murdered with a sword on the 1st of November at not forty years of age, roughly ten years after her second marriage, for alleged infidelity by her stepson Giovanni Battista dell'Anguillara in Stabiae Castle. Her first marriage had been to Puccio Pucci, whom she married on the 10th of November 1483. From her second marriage to Count Giuliano dell'Anguillara and Stabiae whom she had married on the 15th of February 1495, came the daughter Isabella (Elisabeth) della Anguillara, who later married Galeazzo Farnese, the grandson of Bartolomeo, and the children of that marriage, the daughters Violante and Giulia Farnese. Some sources give the year of Girolama's death as 1504, some as 1505. Puccio Pucci died in 1494, and she married her second husband the following year. Vicino's wife Giulia Farnese was thus related to Pope Paul III two times over, as the child of the only child of his tragically murdered sister, and through the line that inherited the family title and holdings through his brother Bartolomeo as the daughter of Bartolomeo's grandson. In a book published in 1556, Le Imagine del tempio della signaro Giovanna Aragona, by Giuseppe Betussi, Giulia Farnese Orsini is referred to as amongst the most virtuous ladies of Italy, on account of her constancy, having remained faithful to Vicino during the long periods when he was absent at war. Vicino's career as condottiero ended in the 1550s, when he was taken prisoner and the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis ended the French-Spanish Wars in Italy. Orsini then retired to Bomarzo where he surrounded himself with writers and artists, and devoted himself to an Epicurean style of life, which negated any contact with religion. Here he had a family and, starting from 1547, created the famous Park, whose enigmatic constructions and sculptures are one of the most suggestive example of late Renaissance art in Italy. After the death of his wife he dedicated the park to her memory. Vicino and Giulia had several children. Their eldest son was Corradino (b.1545). According to Casa Cesarini. Ricerche e documenti by Patrizia Rosini, Vicino Orsini married Giulia Farnese on the 11th of February 1545 in Rocca di Giove. According to the same book Giulia was named after her great-aunt because her mother Isabella had been raised and protected by her when she lost her mother. This book gives the year of Giulia's death as 1560, while Bomarzo: Ein Garten gegen Gott und die Welt by Renate Vergeiner gives it as 1564. According to Bomarzo: Ein Garten gegen Gott und die Welt the two married in 1541. The article The Collection of Corradino Orsino by Lothar Sickel places the wedding in January 1541. Both books agree, however, that the couple had five sons, Corradino, Marzio, Alessandro, Scipione and Orazio (died in the famous Battle of Lepanto in 1571), and two daughters, Faustina and Ottavia. Portrait of Donna Faustina Orsini Mattei (1557-1594) by Scipione Pulzone Faustina Orsini (1557-1594) married Fabio Mattei. Fabio inherited the Palazzo Nuovo (Palazzo Mattei di Paganica) on his father‚Äôs death in 1566. He remained close to Cardinal Odoardo Farnese after the marriage. ¬´It was with Fabio Mattei that the latter commissioned Annibale Carracci to paint the Piet√† installed in the Mattei family chapel in San Francesco a Ripa at Easter 1603 (even though the chapel itself was not completed for a number of years), and Fabio bequeathed some works of art to Odoardo when he died in 1612. He evidently devoted himself to charitable pursuits within the SS Trinit√† after the death of his wife in 1594.¬ª Her portrait was painted by Scipione Pulzone. Ottavia married Marcantonio Marescotti, III Count of Vignanello, and became Countess of Vignanello. The couple had the children Sforza Vicino Marescotti, IV Count of Vignanello, Clarice ‚Äì Santa Giacinta Marescotti, Ginevra and Ortensia. Pier Francesco Orsini died on the 28 of January 1583.

He began his education studying in a local madrassa under Maulana Abdus Salam. His first mentor was Maulana Sufi Mohammad, to whom he was introduced in 1993 at the age of 22. Sufi Mohammad is the founder of Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM), or Movement for the Enforcement of Islamic Laws. He has one wife in a tribal society, where polygamy is not uncommon. Mohammed was a staunch activist of TNSM. He and his two sons were captured in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban in late 2001, and were held in Dera Ismail Khan jail in southern Pakistan.

He was warned in January 2006 that failure to surrender to authorities would result in his house being burnt down again. He is third in command of the Pakistani Taliban umbrella group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), formed in December 2007 under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud and prefers the title Commander Faqir.Abbas, Hassan. \\"A Profile of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan\\". CTC Sentinel 1 (2): 1‚Äì4. January 2008, 2009 Ceasefire On 23 February 2009 Faqir Mohammed declared in a 30-minute radio broadcast that his followers would begin a unilateral ceasefire. The speech came only a few hours after the Pakistani military announced a halt to operations in the nearby Swat valley, where it had been battling the Swati division of the TTP under the leadership of Maulana Fazlullah. TTP leadership changes After Baituallah Mehsud's reported death in August 2009, Maulana Faqir Mohammed announced to the BBC that he would assume temporary leadership of the TTP and that Muslim Khan would serve as primary spokesperson. He also maintained that Baitullah had not been killed but rather was in ill health. Faqir further elaborated that decisions over leadership of the umbrella group would only be made in consultation and consensus with other TTP leaders. \\"The congregation of Taliban leaders has 32 members and no important decision can be taken without their consultation,\\" he told the BBC. He reported to the AFP that both Hakimullah Mehsud and Wali-ur-Rehman had approved his appointment as temporary leader of the militant group. Neither militant had publicly confirmed Faqir's statement, and analysts cited by Dawn News believed the assumption of leadership actually indicated a power struggle. Two days later Faqir Mohammed retracted his claims of temporary leadership and said that Hakimullah Mehsud had been selected leader of the TTP. Reported death After the alleged death of Hakimullah Mehsud in mid-January, 2010, Faqir Mohammed was one of the highest level leaders. Malik Noor Jamal alias Maulana Toofan was reported to have been appointed as head of the TTP after Mehsud's death but his leadership may not have been entirely accepted as there were also reports of deadly clashes between Toofan's men and those of a TTP leader in Kurram. Pakistan launched an air attack on a building where it was thought that Faqir Mohammed was having a meeting with Taliban figures Fateh Mohammad and Qari Ziaur Rehman. Fateh Mohammed was quickly confirmed as dead but the death of the other two was not known immediately.Taliban leader in Swat Valley killed in airstrike Within days, Faqir Mohammed gave a telephone interview and claimed that he was not present at the attack and that all senior officials had survived. Cross-border raids Faqir Mohammed launched attacks on Pakistani border posts from Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province, across the border with Pakistan's Bajaur Agency, and was hosted by Qari Zia-ur-Rahman. Mohammed claimed responsibility for a 4 July 2011, attack on a paramilitary checkpoint and for similar attacks in June 2011 on several border villages in Bajaur. During a radio broadcast Mohammed stated, \\"Our fighters carried out these two attacks from Afghanistan, and we will launch more such attacks inside Afghanistan and in Pakistan.\\" TTP demotion In early March 2012 the TTP announced that Faqir had been demoted from his role as naib amir and would be \\"considered a common fighter.\\" The main TTP spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, reported that Faqir Mohammed had been conducting peace talks with the Pakistani government without the approval of TTP leadership. Arrest On 18 February 2013 Maulvi Faqir was arrested along with his four accomplices by Afghan Intelligence Officials while he was trying to enter Pakistan‚Äôs Tirah Valley from Afghanistan‚Äôs Nangarhar province.

It was built between 1974 and 1976 by Baranya County State Construction Industry Company (Baranya Megyei √Ållami √âp√≠t≈ëipari V√°llalat). When it was inhabited, it had 800 residences. In 1989, however, it was determined that the building's inner structure was deteriorating to a dangerous extent. The building was evacuated. There have been some plans to renovate and use the building for various purposes, but none of these were ever realized. By 2003 the building had fallen into a critical condition, so it was reinforced, but it remained out of use. It was the tallest out-of-use building in Central Europe until its deconstruction in 2016.  History  The reinforced concrete structure of Magash√°z was built using Yugoslavian IMS post tensioning technology. This technology was used to create residential and public buildings in Hungary since the early 1970s. The idea behind IMS was constructing premade floor slabs and columns, connecting them afterwards. The gaps between elements were filled with a sealant called PU paste. This filling material however, was known to cause chloride corrosion over time, damaging the beams and in Yugoslavia, they used an inhibitor material and also separated the paste from the tensioned posts with a 1mm thin plastic sheet but in Hungary, they skipped these despite only a very small amount of inhibitor would've been necessary.Az IMS a magyar √©p√≠t≈ëipar legs√∂t√©tebb, legundor√≠t√≥bb fejezete Because of this, the building became unstable, and the inhabitants had to move out by the year 1989. In 2003 the local government paid 360 million Hungarian Forints for structural repairs. The building was sold for an Austrian company, the Porr Hung√°ria Kft, to make it a dormitory for the University of P√©cs in the PPP program. The company stepped back from the agreement in 2007. In the fall of 2007, the city made an unsuccessful tender to convert the building into an office for the local government. Magash√°z was sold again in 2008 to the La Torre 2008 Kft, that accumulated significant debt over the years since. No progress has been made in the utilization of the building until 2011, when the idea of selling Magash√°z to the company √ñresund Holding incurred, so that it would be demolished, and a municipal building would be constructed in its place, that would be rented by the city for 30 years. On 25 April 2013 the Second Cabinet of Viktor Orb√°n held a session in P√©cs. Here, Viktor Orb√°n made a promise to mayor Zsolt P√°va, that the government will give one billion Hungarian forints for the demolition of Magash√°z, if the city acquires the ownership of the building. On 4 October 2013 the La Torre 2008 Kft. was acquired by a citizen of P√©cs, the 76 years old pensioner Hossz√∫ Zolt√°n D√©nesn√©. The court of Kom√°rom-Esztergom ordered the liquidation of the company on 16 October. On 22 October 2013 the declaration of demolition for the building was issued, giving a six-month deadline for the owner. Finally in March 2016 the demolishing started and the last walls of the building disappeared in October 2016. = Short summary of the history of Magash√°z = * 1974: beginning of the construction * 1976: first inhabitants move in * 1983: first signs of corrosion are noticed during an inspection * 1988: after extensive inspections, the building was pronounced dangerously unstable * 1989: inhabitants move out * 2003: the frame is reinforced for 360 million Forints * 2007: the Porr Hung√°ria Kft gives the building back to the city * 2008: La Torre 2008 Kft. acquires the building * 2013: the declaration of demolition is issued * 2015: preparations for the deconstruction commence * 2016: deconstruction References External links * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=55520 Category:Skyscrapers in Hungary Category:Buildings and structures in P√©cs Category:Residential skyscrapers Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Hungary Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2016 ","title":"High-rise of P√©cs"},{"id":"7701222","text":"Snaith is a town in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, approximately west of Goole on the A1041 at its junction with the A645.

The library is located at 27333 Center Ridge Road in Westlake, Ohio. In 2009, the library loaned more than 1.47 million items to its 34,000 cardholders. Total holding are over 176,000 volumes with over 500 periodical subscriptions. History In 1884, Leonard Porter willed the sum of $1,000 to the establishment of a public library in Dover Township, Ohio (which became Westlake Township in 1940, and the City of Westlake in 1957) and a collection of books to be housed within. Circulation records date back to 1893, when the average circulation per week was 24.083 books, or about 1,252 books per year. As Dover Township grew, so did its library. The town passed a tax revenue agreement in support of library funds in 1897. Porter Library sponsored debates, meetings and social functions in the 1900s. An Ice Cream Saloon was held on alternate Saturdays. The library extended its collection and services to the Dover Township schools in 1920. In 1933 the permanent legislation enacted by the Ohio State Legislature allocated proceeds from personal property tax to the boards of library trustees. Porter Library received $3,096. Audrey Ward served as library director from 1939-1960. The 1940s saw continued development of the library. The building was remodeled, hours of service increased, and the book budget improved. The library moved to new quarters in 1950: the Ohio Bell Telephone Company building at 27059 Center Ridge Road. By 1957, the library trustees realized that with the growth of the population of the community (an amazing rate of one family per day), Porter Library needed room to expand. In July 1958 the library celebrated a groundbreaking for a new addition. The new wing opened on February 1, 1960. Under the leadership of library director, Kathleen Carnall, the library facilitated its goals of bringing people together, promoting community involvement, sharing information and encouraging learning. Porter Library staff developed pre-school and school age children‚Äôs programming, such as story hours. They acquired a young adult collection, and extended library services to parochial schools. They supported adult programs, and organized a pamphlet and picture file, a periodical collection, and a film, filmstrip and phonograph collection. In 1981 the library acquired a special mascot. A one-eyed gray and black tabby cat named Jiggers moved with the library when the building took permanent residence at 27333 Center Ridge Road in 1985. Westlake Porter Public Library's catalog became an online version in 1986. The library provided patrons with computers and the classes to learn how to use them. On October 12, 1992 Paula Miller, library director, joined the staff and shared her vision of the future. In the early 1990s the library took on the role of community center for advanced telecommunications and multimedia/electronic access. Collections also changed to include multimedia such as CDs, videos, and later DVDs. Online reference services became available. Outreach services expanded. The library moved into a temporary facility in 1999 in the old Rego grocery store at 24350 Center Ridge Road, while the building expanded from 32,000 to .

Quote * \\"The morrow after Simon and Jude's day I was hanged at the wall from the ground, my manacles fast locked into a staple as high as I could reach upon a stool: the stool taken away where I hanged from a little after 8 o'clock in the morning until after 4 in the afternoon, without any ease or comfort at all, saving that Topcliffe came in and told me that the Spaniards were come into Southwark by our means: 'For lo, do you not hear the drums' (for then the drums played in honour of the Lord Mayor). The next day after also I was hanged up an hour or two: such is the malicious minds of our adversaries.\\"‚ÄîIn a letter written to Father Henry Garnet from prison, 23 November 1591.

He is also the dean of the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs at Moscow's Higher School of Economics. Karaganov was a close associate of Yevgeny Primakov, and has been Presidential Advisor to both Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. thumb Karaganov has been a member of the Trilateral Commission since 1998, and served on the International Advisory Board of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1995 until 2005. He has also been Deputy Director of the Institute of Europe at the USSR (now Russian) Academy of Sciences since 1989.  Political activity  Karaganov is known as the progenitor of the Karaganov Doctrine, which states that Moscow should pose as the defender of human rights of ethnic Russians living in the 'near abroad' for the purpose of gaining political influence in these regions. After Karaganov published an article advocating this stance in 1992, Russia's foreign policy position linked Russian troop withdrawals from the Baltics with the end of 'systemic discrimination' against Russians in these countries. In addition to his Doctrine, Karaganov has advocated for a united Sino-Russian strategy to unify a Eurasian bloc. He argues that the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and China's One Belt One Road Initiative (OBOR), will work together to promote economic integration throughout the region. Many experts disagree with this judgement, claiming that China, as a far more powerful economy, will simply dominate this Eurasian bloc. This would counter Russian ambitions to regain their foothold as a global power. Karaganov is the only intellectual from the former Soviet Union listed in the 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll, and only one of four, with Pavol Deme≈°, V√°clav Havel and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek, from Eastern Europe.

A penalty shot or penalty kick is a play used in several sports whereby a goal is attempted during untimed play. Depending on the sport, when a player commits certain types of penalties, the opposition is awarded a penalty shot or kick attempt. The rules on how a player attempts a penalty shot or kick also varies between sports. Penalty shots or kicks are sometimes grouped into the larger penalty shootout, which is used as a tiebreaker to decide games in several sports. Association football In association football, a penalty kick is awarded to the opponent when a direct free kick foul has been committed by a team within its own penalty area. The shot is taken from the penalty mark, which is from the goal line and centred between the touch line, while the goal is defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper. If the match is tied after 90min of regulation and 30min of extra time, a penalty shootout is used to determine the winner. Penalties are taken from the spot, but no rebounds are allowed. Bandy A penalty shot in bandy A penalty shot is awarded to the fouled team in bandy, following a foul usually punishable by a free-shot but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area. The situations when a penalty shot is to be made is stated in Rule 14 of the Bandy Playing Rules published by the Federation of International Bandy. The execution of a penalty shot is regulated in Rule 15. If a match is at a draw at full time, a penalty shot competition can be arranged in order to determine a winning team, either after an extension of the match which still is at a draw or instead of an extension. This is regulated in Rule 16. Gaelic football In Gaelic football, a penalty kick may be awarded if a defender commits a foul within the large rectangle enclosing the goal. The penalty kick is taken from the ground from the centre of the line. Only the goalkeeper may guard the goals. Ice hockey An ice hockey penalty shot In ice hockey, a penalty shot is awarded to a player in a good shooting position denied a chance at a goal by the foul of an opponent. All players are required to leave the ice rink as the player who got fouled faces off solely against the goaltender of the opposite team. The puck is placed at the center of the ice rink as the player has twenty seconds to retrieve the puck and attempt to score a goal against the goaltender. The penalty shot ends as soon as the puck either crosses the goal line, is blocked by the goaltender, stops moving, moves in the opposite direction of the goal line, or if the shooter loses possession of the puck. Polo A penalty shot is awarded. There is an example below: The player who is charged with a brutality is red-carded; that team plays shorthanded for 4 minutes, and is forced to play with one less player than the other team for that duration. In addition to the exclusion, a penalty shot is also awarded to the opposing team, if the foul occurs during actual play. Rugby A rugby penalty goal attempt If a side commits a penalty infringement the opposition can take the option of a place kick at goal from where the infringement occurred. A successful penalty kick is worth two points in rugby league and three points in rugby union. Water polo A penalty shot or throw is awarded when a defender commits a major foul within the six meter area that prevents a likely goal. Similar plays In field hockey, a penalty stroke or a penalty corner is awarded after a foul. Free throws are the equivalent of the penalty shot in basketball; free throws are much more common than penalty shots in other sports, due to the much higher rate of scoring in that game. Gridiron football does not have any sort of explicit equivalent to the penalty shot; scenarios where an illegal act deprived someone of a score are handled through the unfair act clause, which allows officials the right to assess any penalty they see fit, including awarding the score automatically.

It is owned by Spokane City-County. The airport has two runways. Felts Field is now used for general aviation, but it was Spokane's airline airport before the opening of Spokane International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021 categorized it as a regional reliever facility.  History  Boeing Air Transport B-40 at Felts Field on September 23, 1927 Felts Field, Spokane's historic airfield, is on the south bank of the Spokane River east of Spokane. Aviation activities began in 1913. In 1920 the field, then called the Parkwater airstrip, was designated a municipal flying field at the instigation of the Spokane Chamber of Commerce. In 1926 the United States Department of Commerce recognized Parkwater as an airport, one of the first in the West. In September 1927, in conjunction with Spokane's National Air Races that Felts Field hosted ,https://www.historylink.org/File/7924 the airport was renamed Felts Field for James Buell Felts (1898‚Äì1927), a Washington Air National Guard aviator killed in a crash that May. Parkwater Aviation Field, later Felts Field, was the location for flight instruction, charter service, airplane repair, aerial photography, headquarters of the 116th Observation Squadron of the Washington Air National Guard, and eventually the first airmail and commercial flights in and out of Spokane. In summer 1946 the airlines (Northwest and United) moved to Geiger Field (later Spokane International Airport). Felts Field remains a busy regional hub for private and small-plane aviation and related businesses and services. In 1991 it was designated Felts Field Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. United Airlines Plane and DeSoto at Spokane Airport (Now Felts Field) on July 19, 1934 Today the airport is used for general aviation. No scheduled passenger service remains at Felts, though scheduled Part 135 cargo operations remain via UPS and DHL contracting (Ameriflight LLC and previously Merlin Express Airways).  Facilities Felts Field covers at an elevation of 1,957 feet (596 m). It has two runways: 4L/22R is 4,499 by 150 feet (1,371 x 46 m) concrete and 4R/22L is 2,650 by 75 feet (808 x 23 m) asphalt. It has a seaplane landing area designated 3W/21W, 6,000 by 100 feet (1,829 x 30 m). In the year ending February 28, 2015 the airport had 54,881 aircraft operations, average 150 per day: 93% general aviation, 7% air taxi, and <1% military. In July 2017, 176 aircraft were based at this airport: 146 single-engine, 15 multi-engine, and 15 helicopters.  Cargo carriers   Accidents and incidents * On November 29, 2003 an Ameriflight LLC cargo (Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner) (N439AF) crashed on approach to runway 22R at Felts Field using ILS. The pilot's HSI was previously noted as inoperative, deferred, and due for scheduled maintenance. It is unclear whether the pilot was using backup instrumentation as prescribed via the deferral process or using the faulty HSI. The Metro III failed to maintain ILS glide slope and crashed short of the runway into rising terrain and trees. The pilot was killed during the subsequent impact and fire. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.

It was carried out through executions in death camps, as well as through mass murder, ethnic cleansing, deportations, forced conversions, and war rape. This genocide was simultaneously carried out with the Holocaust in the NDH as well as the genocide of Roma, by combining Nazi racial policies with the ultimate goal of creating an ethnically pure Greater Croatia. The ideological foundation of the Usta≈°e movement reaches back to the 19th century. Several Croatian nationalists and intellectuals established theories about Serbs as an inferior race. The World War I legacy, as well as the opposition of a group of nationalists to the unification into a common state of South Slavs, influenced ethnic tensions in the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (since 1929 Kingdom of Yugoslavia). The 6 January Dictatorship and the later anti-Croat policies of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government in the 1920s and 1930s fueled the rise of nationalist and far-right movements. This culminated in the rise of the Usta≈°e, an ultranationalist, fascist and terrorist organization, founded by Paveliƒá. The movement was financially and ideologically supported by Benito Mussolini, and it was also involved in the assassination of King Alexander I. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, a German puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was established, comprising most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as parts of modern-day Serbia and Slovenia, ruled by the Usta≈°e. The Usta≈°e's goal was to create an ethnically homogeneous Greater Croatia by eliminating all non-Croats, with the Serbs being the primary target but Jews, Roma and political dissidents were also targeted for elimination. Large scale massacres were committed and concentration camps were built, the largest one was the Jasenovac, which was notorious for its high mortality rate and the barbaric practices which occurred in it. Furthermore, the NDH was the only Axis puppet state to establish concentration camps specifically for children. The regime systematically murdered approximately 200,000 to 500,000 Serbs. 300,000 Serbs were further expelled and at least 200,000 more Serbs were forcibly converted, most of whom de-converted following the war. Proportional to the population, the NDH was one of the most lethal Europeam regimes. Mile Budak and other NDH high officials were tried and convicted of war crimes by the communist authorities. Concentration camp commandants such as Ljubo Milo≈° and Miroslav Filipoviƒá were captured and executed, while Aloysius Stepinac was found guilty of forced conversion. Many others escaped, including the supreme leader Ante Paveliƒá, most to Latin America. The genocide wasn‚Äôt properly examined in the aftermath of the war, because the post-war Yugoslav government didn‚Äôt encourage independent scholars out of concern that ethnic tensions would destabilize the new communist regime. Nowadays, –æn 22 April, Serbia marks the public holiday dedicated to the victims of genocide and fascism, while Croatia holds an official commemoration at the Jasenovac Memorial Site.  Historical background  Many scholars claimed that the ideological foundation of the Usta≈°e movement, reaches back to the 19th century, when Ante Starƒçeviƒá established the Party of Rights, , , , , , , , , as well as when Josip Frank seceded his extreme fraction from it and formed his own the Pure Party of Rights.,, ,, , , Starƒçeviƒá was a major ideological influence on the Croatian nationalism of the Usta≈°e, he was an advocate of Croatian unity and independence and was both anti-Habsburg and anti-Serb. He envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia that would include territories inhabited by Bosniaks, Serbs, and Slovenes, considering Bosniaks and Serbs to be Croats who had been converted to Islam and Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Starƒçeviƒá called the Serbs an ‚Äúunclean race‚Äù, a ‚Äúnomadic people‚Äù and ‚Äúa race of slaves, the most loathsome beasts‚Äù, while co-founder of his party, Eugen Kvaternik, denied the existence of Serbs in Croatia, seeing their political consciousness as a threat. He was cited as ‚Äúfather of racism‚Äù, while some Usta≈°e ideologues have linked Starƒçeviƒá's racial ideas to Adolf Hitler's racial ideology. Frank‚Äôs party embraced Starƒçeviƒá‚Äôs position that Serbs are an obstacle to Croatian political and territorial ambitions, and then the aggressive anti-Serb attitudes became one of the main characteristics of the party. The followers of the ultranationalist Pure Party of Right were known as the Frankists (Frankovci) and they would become the main pool of members of the subsequent Usta≈°e movement. Following the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungarian Empire, the provisional state which was formed on the southern territories of the Empire which joined the Allies-associate Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia), ruled by the Serbian Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. Historian John Paul Newman explained the influence of the Frankists, as well as the legacy of the World War I on the Usta≈°e ideology and later genocidal means. Many war veterans had fought at various ranks and on various fronts on both the ‚Äòvictorious‚Äô and ‚Äòdefeated‚Äô sides of the war. Serbia suffered the biggest casualty rate in the whole world, while Croats fought in the Austro-Hungarian army and two of them served as military governor of Bosnia and occupied Serbia. They both endorsed Austria‚ÄìHungary‚Äôs denationalizing plans in Serb- populated lands and supported the idea of incorporating a tamed Serbia into Empire. Newman stated that Austro-Hungarian officers' ‚Äúunfaltering opposition to Yugoslavia provided a blueprint for the Croatian radical right, the Usta≈°e‚Äù. The Frankists blamed Serbian nationalists for the defeat of Austria- Hungary and opposed the creation of Yugoslavia, which was identified by them as a cover for Greater Serbia. –úass Croatian national consciousness appeared after the establishment of a common state of South Slavs and it was directed against the new Kingdom, more precisely against Serbian predominance within it. Early 20th century Croatian intellectuals Ivo Pilar, ƒÜiro Truhelka and Milan ≈†ufflay influenced the Usta≈°e concept of nation and racial identity, as well as the theory of Serbs as an inferior race. Pilar, historian, politician and lawyer, placed great emphasis on racial determinism arguing that Croats had been defined by the ‚ÄúNordic-Aryan‚Äù racial and cultural heritage, while Serbs had \\"interbred\\" with the \\"Balkan-Romanic Vlachs‚Äù. Truhelka, archeologist and historian, claimed that Bosnian Muslims were ethnic Croats, who, according to him, belonged to the racially superior Nordic race. On the other hand, Serbs belonged to the ‚Äúdegenerate race‚Äù of the Vlachs. The Usta≈°e promoted the theories of historian and politician ≈†ufflay, who is believed to have claimed that Croatia had been \\"one of the strongest ramparts of Western civilization for many centuries\\", which he claimed had been lost through its union with Serbia when the nation of Yugoslavia was formed in 1918. The outburst of Croatian nationalism after 1918 was one of the one of the main threats for Yugoslavia‚Äôs stability. During the 1920s, Ante Paveliƒá, lawyer, politician and one of the Frankists, emerged as the leading spokesman for Croatian independence. In 1927, he secretly contacted Benito Mussolini, dictator of Italy and founder of fascism, and presented his separatist ideas to him. Paveliƒá proposed an independent Greater Croatia that should cover the entire historical and ethnic area of the Croats. In that period, Mussolini was interested in Balkans with the aim of isolating Yugoslavia, by strengthening Italian influence on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea. British historian Rory Yeomans claimed that there are indication that Paveliƒá had been considering the formation of some kind of nationalist insurgency group as early as 1928. Ante Paveliƒá, one of the Frankists and the leading spokesman for Croatian independence in interwar Yugoslavia, founded the Usta≈°e movement In June 1928, Stjepan Radiƒá, the leader of the largest and most popular Croatian party Croatian Peasant Party (, HSS) was mortally wounded in the parliamentary chamber by Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá, a Montenegrin Serb leader, former Chetnik member and deputy of the ruling Serb People's Radical Party. Raƒçiƒá also shot two other HSS deputies dead and wounded two more. The killings provoked violent student protests in Zagreb. Trying to suppress the conflict between Croatian and Serbian political parties, King Alexander I proclaimed a dictatorship with the aim of establishing the ‚Äúintegral Yugoslavism‚Äù and single Yugoslav nation. The introduction of the royal dictatorship brought separatist forces to the fore, especially among the Croats and Macedonians. The Usta≈°a ‚Äì Croatian Revolutionary Movement () emerged as the most extreme movement of these. The Usta≈°e was created in late 1929 or early 1930 among radical and militant student and youth groups, which existed from the late 1920s. Precisely, the movement was founded by journalist Gustav Perƒçec and Ante Paveliƒá. They were driven by a deep hatred of Serbs and Serbdom and claimed that, \\"Croats and Serbs were separated by an unbridgeable cultural gulf\\" which prevented them from ever living alongside each other. Paveliƒá accused the Belgrade government of propagating ‚Äúa barbarian culture and Gypsy civilization‚Äù, claiming they were spreading ‚Äúatheism and bestial mentality in divine Croatia‚Äù. Supporters of the Usta≈°e planned genocide years before World War II, for example one of Paveliƒá's main ideologues, Mijo Babiƒá, wrote in 1932 that the Usta≈°e \\"will cleanse and cut whatever is rotten from the healthy body of the Croatian people\\". In 1933, the Usta≈°e presented \\"The Seventeen Principles\\" that formed the official ideology of the movement. The Principles stated the uniqueness of the Croatian nation, promoted collective rights over individual rights and declared that people who were not Croat by \\"blood\\" would be excluded from political life. In order to explain and justify ‚Äúterror machine‚Äù, what they regularly referred to as ‚Äúsome excesses‚Äù by individuals, the Usta≈°e cited, among other things, policies of inter-was Yugoslav government which they described as Serbian hegemony ‚Äúthat cost the lives of thousand Croats‚Äù. Historian Jozo Tomasevich explains that that argument is not true, claiming that between December 1918 and April 1941 about 280 Croats were killed for political reason, and that no specific motive for the killings could be identified, as they may also be linked to clashes during the agrarian reform. Moreover, he stated that Serbs too were denied civil and political rights during royal dictatorship. However, Tomasevich explains that the anti- Croatian policies of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav government in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as, the shooting of the HSS deputies by Radiƒá were largely responsible for the creation, growth and nature of Croatian nationalist forces. This culminated in the Usta≈°e movement and ultimately its anti-Serbian policies in the World War II, which was totally out of proportions to earlier anti-Croatian measures, in a nature and extent. Historian Rory Yeomans explains that Usta≈°e officials constantly emphasized crimes against Croats by the Yugoslav government and security forces, although many of them were imagined, though some of them real, as justification for the their envisioned eradication of the Serbs. Political scientist Tamara Pavasoviƒá Tro≈°t, commenting on historiography and textbooks, listed the claims that terror against Serbs arose as a result of ‚Äútheir previous hegemony‚Äù as an example of the relativisation of Usta≈°e crimes. Historian Aristotle Kallis explained that anti-Serb prejudices were a \\"chimera\\" which emerged through living together in Yugoslavia with continuity with previous stereotypes. The Usta≈°e functioned as a terrorist organization as well. The first Usta≈°e center was established in Vienna, where brisk anti-Yugoslav propaganda soon developed and agents were prepared for terrorist actions. They organized the so-called Velebit uprising in 1932, assaulting a police station in the village of Bru≈°ani in Lika. In 1934, the Usta≈°e cooperated with Bulgarian, Hungarian and Italian right-wing extremists to assassinate King Alexander while he visited the French city of Marseille. Paveliƒá's fascist tendencies were apparent. The Usta≈°e movement was financially and ideologically supported by Benito Mussolini., , , , , During the intensification of ties with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, Paveliƒá's concept of the Croatian nation became increasingly race-oriented.  Independent State of Croatia  In April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers. After Nazi forces entered Zagreb on 10 April 1941, Paveliƒá's closest associate Slavko Kvaternik, proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) on a Radio Zagreb broadcast. Meanwhile, Paveliƒá and several hundred Usta≈°e volunteers left their camps in Italy and travelled to Zagreb, where Paveliƒá declared a new government on 16 April 1941. He accorded himself the title of \\"Poglavnik\\" (, ). The NDH combined most of modern Croatia, all of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern Serbia into an \\"Italian- German quasi-protectorate\\". Serbs made up about 30% of the NDH population. The NDH was never fully sovereign, but it was a puppet state that enjoyed the greatest autonomy than any other regime in German-occupied Europe. The Independent State of Croatia was declared to be on Croatian \\"ethnic and historical territory\\". The Usta≈°e became obsessed with creating an ethnically pure state. As outlined by Usta≈°e ministers Mile Budak, Mirko Puk and Milovan ≈Ωaniƒá, the strategy to achieve an ethnically pure Croatia was that:Jones, Adam & Nicholas A. Robins. (2009), Genocides by The Oppressed: Subaltern Genocide In Theory and Practice, p. 106, Indiana University Press; # One-third of the Serbs were to be killed # One-third of the Serbs were to be expelled # One- third of the Serbs were to be forcibly converted to Catholicism According to historian Ivo Goldstein, this formula was never published but it is undeniable that the Usta≈°e applied it towards Serbs. The Usta≈°e movement received limited support from ordinary Croats. In May 1941, the Usta≈°e had about 100,000 members who took the oath. However, local support for Usta≈°e violence was larger than the number of members could suggest. Since Vladko Maƒçek called on the supporters of the Croatian Peasant Party to respect and co-operate with the new regime of Ante Paveliƒá, he was able to use the apparatus of the party and most of the officials from the former Croatian Banovina. Initially, Croatian soldiers who had previously served in the Austro-Hungarian army held the highest positions in the NDH armed forces. Historian Irina Ognyanova stated that the similarities between the NDH and the Third Reich included the assumption that terror and genocide were necessary for the preservation of the state. Viktor Gutiƒá made several speeches in early summer 1941, calling Serbs \\"former enemies\\" and \\"unwanted elements\\" to be cleansed and destroyed, and also threatened Croats who did not support their cause. Much of the ideology of the Usta≈°e was based on Nazi racial theory. Like the Nazis, the Usta≈°e deemed Jews, Romani, and Slavs to be sub-humans (Untermensch). They endorsed the claims from German racial theorists that Croats were not Slavs but a Germanic race. Their genocides against Serbs, Jews, and Romani were thus expressions of Nazi racial ideology. Adolf Hitler supported Paveliƒá in order to punish the Serbs. Historian Michael Phayer explained that the Nazis‚Äô decision to kill all of Europe's Jews is estimated by some to have begun in the latter half of 1941 in late June which, if correct, would mean that the genocide in Croatia began before the Nazi killing of Jews. Jonathan Steinberg stated that the crimes against Serbs in the NDH were the ‚Äúearliest total genocide to be attempted during the World War II‚Äù. Andrija Artukoviƒá, the Minister of Interior of the Independent State of Croatia, signed into law a number of racial laws. On 30 April 1941, the government adopted ‚Äúthe legal order of races‚Äù and ‚Äúthe legal order of the protection of Atyan blood and the honor of Croatian people‚Äù. Croats and about 750,000 Bosnian Muslims, whose support was needed against the Serbs, were proclaimed Aryans. Donald Bloxham and Robert Gerwarth concluded that Serbs were primary target of racial laws and murders. The Usta≈°e introduced the laws to strip Serbs of their citizenship, livelihoods, and possessions. Similar to Jews in the Third Reich, Serbs were forced to wear armbands bearing the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù, for Pravoslavac (Orthodox). Usta≈°e writers adopted dehumanizing rhetoric. In 1941, the usage of the Cyrillic script was banned, and in June 1941 began the elimination of \\"Eastern\\" (Serbian) words from the Croatian language, as well as the shutting down of Serbian schools. Ante Paveliƒá ordered, through the \\"Croatian state office for language\\", the creation of new words from old roots (some which are used today), and purged many Serbian words.  Concentration and extermination camps  Head of Serbian Orthodox priest and Usta≈°e The Usta≈°e set up temporary concentration camps in the spring of 1941 and laid the groundwork for a network of permanent camps in autumn. The creation of concentration camps and extermination campaign of Serbs had been planned by the Usta≈°e leadership long before 1941. In Usta≈°e state exhibits in Zagreb, the camps were portrayed as productive and \\"peaceful work camps\\", with photographs of smiling inmates. Serbs, Jews and Romani were arrested and sent to concentration camps such as Jasenovac, Stara Gradi≈°ka, Gospiƒá and Jadovno. There were 22‚Äì26 camps in NDH in total. Historian Jozo Tomasevich described that the Jadovno concentration camp itself acted as a \\"way station\\" en route to pits located on Mount Velebit, where inmates were executed and dumped. The largest and most notorious camp was the Jasenovac-Stara Gradi≈°ka complex, the largest extermination camp in the Balkans., An estimated 100,000 inmates perished there, most Serbs., Vjekoslav \\"Maks\\" Luburiƒá, the commander-in-chief of all the Croatian camps, announced the great \\"efficiency\\" of the Jasenovac camp at a ceremony on 9 October 1942, and also boasted: \\"We have slaughtered here at Jasenovac more people than the Ottoman Empire was able to do during its occupation of Europe.\\" The Srbosjek (\\"Serb cutter\\"), an agricultural knife worn over the hand that was used by the Usta≈°e for the quick slaughter of inmates. Bounded by rivers and two barbed-wire fences making escape unlikely, the Jasenovac camp was divided into five camps, the first two closed in December 1941, while the rest were active until the end of the war. Stara Gradi≈°ka (Jasenovac V) held women and children. The Ciglana (brickyards, Jasenovac III) camp, the main killing ground and essentially a death camp, had 88% mortality rate, higher than Auschwitz's 84.6%. A former brickyard, a furnace was engineered into a crematorium, with witness testimony of some, including children, being burnt alive and stench of human flesh spreading in the camp. Luburiƒá had a gas chamber built at Jasenovac V, where a considerable number of inmates were killed during a three-month experiment with sulfur dioxide and Zyklon B, but this method was abandoned due to poor construction. Still, that method was unnecessary, as most inmates perished from starvation, disease (especially typhus), assaults with mallets, maces, axes, poison and knives. The srbosjek (\\"Serb-cutter\\") was a glove with an attached curved blade designed to cut throats. Large groups of people were regularly executed upon arrival outside camps and thrown into the river. Unlike German-run camps, Jasenovac specialized in brutal one-on-one violence, such as guards attacking barracks with weapons and throwing the bodies in the trenches. Some historians use a sentence from German sources: ‚ÄúEven German officers and SS men lost their cool when they saw (Usta≈°e) ways and methods.‚Äù The infamous camp commander Filipoviƒá, dubbed fra Sotona (\\"brother Satan\\") and the \\"personification of evil\\", on one occasion drowned Serb women and children by flooding a cellar. Filipoviƒá and other camp commanders (such as Dinko ≈†akiƒá and his wife Nada ≈†akiƒá, the sister of Maks Luburiƒá), used ingenious torture. There were throat-cutting contests of Serbs, in which prison guards made bets among themselves as to who could slaughter the most inmates. It was reported that guard and former Franciscan priest Petar Brzica won a contest on 29 August 1942 after cutting the throats of 1,360 inmates. Inmates were tied and hit over the head with mallets and half-alive hung in groups by the Granik ramp crane, their intestines and necks slashed, then dropped into the river. When the Partisans and Allies closed in at the end of the war, the Usta≈°e began mass liquidations at Jasenovac, marching women and children to death, and shooting most of the remaining male inmates, then torched buildings and documents before fleeing. Many prisoners were victims of rape, sexual mutilation and disembowelment, while induced cannibalism amongst the inmates also took place. Some survivors testified about drinking blood from the slashed throats of the victims and soap making from human corpses. Monument at the Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb dedicated to the children from Kozara who died in Usta≈°e concentration camps = Children's concentration camps = The Independent State of Croatia was the only Axis satellite to have erected camps specifically for children. Special camps for children were those at Sisak, ƒêakovo and Jastrebarsko, while Stara Gradi≈°ka held thousands of children and women. Historian Tomislav Duliƒá explained that the systematic murder of infants and children, who could not pose a threat to the state, serves as one of the important illustration of the genocidal character of Usta≈°a mass killing. The Holocaust and genocide survivors, including Bo≈æo ≈†varc, testified that Usta≈°e tore off the children's hands, as well as, ‚Äúapply a liquid to children‚Äôs mouths with brushes‚Äù, which caused the children to scream and later die. The Sisak camp commander, aphysician Antun Naj≈æer, was dubbed the \\"Croatian Mengele\\" by survivors. Diana Budisavljeviƒá, a humanitarian of Austrian descent, carried out rescue operations and saved more than 15,000 children from Usta≈°e camps. = List of concentration and death camps = * Jasenovac (I‚ÄìIV) ‚Äî around 100,000 inmates perished there, at least 52,000 Serbs * Stara Gradi≈°ka (Jasenovac V) ‚Äî more than 12,000 inmates lost their lives, mostly Serbs * Gospiƒá ‚Äî between 24,000 and 42,000 inmates died, predominantly Serbs Stara Gradi≈°ka concentration camp * Jadovno ‚Äî between 15,000 and 48,000 Serbs and Jews perished there * Slana and Metajna ‚Äî between 4,000 and 12,000 Serbs, Jews and communists died * Sisak ‚Äî 6,693 children passed through the camp, mostly Serbs, between 1,152 and 1,630 died * Danica ‚Äî around 5,000, mostly Serbs, were transported to the camp, some of them were executed * Jastrebarsko ‚Äî 3,336 Serb children passing through the camp, between 449 and 1,500 died * Kru≈°ƒçica ‚Äî around 5,000 Jews and Serbs were interred at the camp, while 3,000 lost their lives * ƒêakovo ‚Äî 3,800 Jewish and Serb women and children were interred at the camp, at least 569 died * Lobor ‚Äî more than 2,000 Jewish and Serb women and children were interred, at least 200 died * Kerestinec ‚Äî 111 Serbs, Jews and communists were captured, 85 were killed * Sajmi≈°te ‚Äî the camp at the NDH territory operated by the Einsatzgruppen and since May 1944 by Usta≈°e; between 20,000 and 23,000 Serbs, Jews, Roma and anti-fascists died here * Hrvatska Mitrovica ‚Äî the concetration camp in Sremska Mitrovica  Massacres  A large number of massacres were committed by the NDH armed forces, Croatian Home Guard (Domobrani) and Usta≈°e Militia. Usta≈°e sawing off the head of a Serb civilian, Branko Jungiƒá The Usta≈°e Militia was organised in 1941 into five (later 15) 700-man battalions, two railway security battalions and the elite Black Legion and Poglavnik Bodyguard Battalion (later Brigade). They were predominantly recruited among the uneducated population and working class. Violence against Serbs began in April 1941 and was initially limited in scope, primarily targeting Serb intelligentsia. By July however, the violence became \\"indiscriminate, widespread and systematic\\". Massacres of Serbs were focused in mixed areas with large Serb populations for necessity and efficiency. In the summer of 1941, Usta≈°e militias and death squads burnt villages and killed thousands of civilian Serbs in the country-side in sadistic ways with various weapons and tools. Men, women, children were hacked to death, thrown alive into pits and down ravines, or set on fire in churches. Some Serb villages near Srebrenica and Ozren were wholly massacred while children were found impaled by stakes in villages between Vlasenica and Kladanj. The Usta≈°e cruelty and sadism shocked even Nazi commanders. A Gestapo report to Reichsf√ºhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, dated 17 February 1942, stated: Charles King emphasized that the concentration camps losing their central place in the Holocaust and genocide research because a large proportion of victims perished in mass executions, ravines and pits. He explained that the actions of the German allies, including the Croatian one, and the town- and village-level elimination of minorities also played a significant role. = Central Croatia = On 28 April 1941, approximately 184‚Äì196 Serbs from Bjelovar were summarily executed, after arrest orders by Kvaternik. It was the first act of mass murder committed by the Usta≈°e upon coming to power, and presaged the wider campaign of genocide against Serbs in the NDH that lasted until the end of the war. A few days following the massacre of Bjelovar Serbs, the Usta≈°e rounded up 331 Serbs in the village of Otoƒçac. The victims were forced to dig their own graves before being hacked to death with axes. Among the victims was the local Orthodox priest and his son. The former was made to recite prayers for the dying as his son was killed. The priest was then tortured, his hair and beard was pulled out, eyes gouged out before he was skinned alive. On 24-25 July 1941, the Usta≈°e militia captured the village of Banski Grabovac in the Banija region and murdered the entire Serb population of 1,100 peasants. On 24 July, over 800 Serb civilians were killed in the village of Vlahoviƒá. Between 29 and 37 July 1941, 280 Serbs were killed and thrown into pits near Kostajnica. Large scale massacres took place in Staro Selo Topusko, Voji≈°nica and Vrginmost About 60% of Sadilovac residents lost their lives during the war. More than 400 Serbs were killed in their homes, including 185 children. On 31 July 1942, in the Sadilovac church the Usta≈°e under Milan Mesiƒá's command massacred more than 580 inhabitants of the surrounding villages, including about 270 children.  Glina  On 11 or 12 May 1941, 260‚Äì300 Serbs were herded into an Orthodox church and shot, after which it was set on fire. The idea for this massacre reportedly came from Mirko Puk, who was the Minister of Justice for the NDH. On 10 May, Ivica ≈†ariƒá, a specialist for such operations traveled to the town of Glina to meet with local Usta≈°e leadership where they drew up a list of names of all the Serbs between sixteen and sixty years of age to be arrested. After much discussion, they decided that all of the arrested should be killed. Many of the town's Serbs heard rumors that something bad was in store for them but the vast majority did not flee. On the night of 11 May, mass arrests of male Serbs over the age of sixteen began. The Usta≈°e then herded the group into an Orthodox Church and demanded that they be given documents proving the Serbs had all converted to Catholicism. Serbs who did not possess conversion certificates were locked inside and massacred. The church was then set on fire, leaving the bodies to burn as Usta≈°e stood outside to shoot any survivors attempting to escape the flames. A similar massacre of Serbs occurred on 30 July 1941. 700 Serbs were gathered into a church under the premise that they would be converted. Victims were killed by having their throats cut or by having their heads smashed in with rifle butts. Between 500‚Äì2000 other Serbs were later massacred in neighbouring villages by Vjekoslav \\"Maks\\" Luburiƒá's forces, continuing until 3 August. In these massacres specifically males 16 years and older were killed. Only one of the victims, Ljubo Jednak, survived by playing dead.  Lika  Sava ≈†umanoviƒá's house in ≈†id, Syrmia, who was tortured and killed together with 150 fellow citizens The district of Gospiƒá experienced the first large-scale massacres which occurred in the Lika region, as some 3,000 Serb civilians were killed between late July and early August 1941. Usta≈°e officials reported an emerging Serb rebellion due to massacres. In late July 1941, a detachment of the Croatian military in Gospiƒá noted that the local insurgents were Serb peasants who had fled to the woods \\"purely as a reaction to the cleansing [operations] against them by our Usta≈°a formations\\". Following a sabotage of railway tracks in the district of Vojniƒá that was attributed to local communists on 27 July 1941, the Usta≈°e began a \\"cleansing\\" operation of indiscriminate pillage and killing of civilians, including the elderly and children. On 6 August 1941, the Usta≈°e killed and burned more than 280 villagers in Mlakva, including 191 children. Between June and August 1941, about 890 Serbs from Liƒçko Petrovo Selo and Melinovac were killed and thrown in the so-called Deliƒá pit. During the war, the Usta≈°e massacred more than 900 Serbs in Divoselo, more than 500 in Smiljan, as well as more than 400 in ≈†iroka Kula near Gospiƒá. On 2 August 1941, the Usta≈°e trapped about 120 children and women and 50 men who tried to escape from Divoselo. After a few days of imprisonment, where women were raped, they were stabbed in groups and thrown into the pits. = Slavonia = On 21 December 1941, approximately 880 Serbs from Dugo Selo Lasinjsko and Prkos Lasinjski were killed in the Brezje forest. On the Serbian New Year, 14 January 1942, the biggest slaughter of the civilians from Slavonia started. Villages were burned, and about 350 people were deported to Voƒáin and executed. = Syrmia = In August 1942, following the joint military anti-partisan operation in the Syrmia by the Usta≈°e and German Wehrmacht, it turned into a massacre by the Usta≈°e militia that left up to 7,000 Serbs dead. Among those killed was the prominent painter Sava ≈†umanoviƒá, who was arrested along with 150 residents of ≈†id, and then tortured by having his arms cut off. = Bosnian Krajina = Drakuliƒá In August 1941 on the Eastern Orthodox Elijah's holy day, who is the patron saint of Bosnia and Herzegovina, between 2,800 and 5,500 Serbs from Sanski Most and the surrounding area were killed and thrown into pits which have been dug by victims themselves. During the war, the NDH armed forces killed over 7,000 Serbs in the municipality of Kozarska Dubica, while the municipality lost more than half of its pre-war population. The biggest massacre was committed by the Croatian Home Guard in January 1942, when the village Drakseniƒá was burned and more than 200 were people killed. In February 1942, the Usta≈°e under Miroslav Filipoviƒá's command massacred 2,300 adults and 550 children in Serb-populated villages Drakuliƒá, Motike and ≈†argovac. The children were chosen as the first victims and their body parts were cut off.  Garavice  From July to September 1941, thousands of Serbs were massacred along with some Jews and Roma victims at Garavice, an extermination location near Bihaƒá. On the night of 17 June 1941, Usta≈°e began the mass killing of previously captured Serbs, who were brought by trucks from the surrounding towns to Garavice. The bodies of the victims were thrown into mass graves. A large amount of blood contaminated the local water supply. = Herzegovina = Garavice Memorial Park On 9 May 1941, approximately 400 Serbs were rounded up from several villages and executed in a pit behind a school in the village of Blagaj. From 4‚Äì6 August 1941, 650 women and children killed by being thrown into the Golubinka pit near ≈†urmanci. Also, hand grenades were thrown at dead bodies. Some 4000 Serbs later massacred in neighbouring places during that summer. In the Livno Field area, the Usta≈°e killed over 1,200 Serbs includiing 370 children. In the Koprivnica Forest near Livno, around 300 citizen were tortured and killed. About 300 children, women and the elderly were killed and thrown into the Ravni Dolac pit in Donji Rujani. = Drina Valley = Some 70-200 Serbs massacred by Muslim Usta≈°e forces in Ra≈°iƒáa Gaj, Vlasenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 22 June and 20 July 1941, after raping women and girls. Many Serbs were executed by Usta≈°e along the Drina Valley for a months, especially near Vi≈°egrad. Jure Francetiƒá's Black Legion killed thousands of defenceless Bosnian Serb civilians and threw their bodies into the Drina river. In 1942, about 6,000 Serbs were killed in Stari Brod near Rogatica and Milo≈°eviƒái. = Sarajevo = During the summer of 1941, Usta≈°e militia periodically interned and executed groups of Sarajevo Serbs. In August 1941, they arrested about one hundred Serbs suspected of ties to the resistance armies, mostly church officials and members of the intelligentsia, and executed them or deported the to concentration camps. The Usta≈°e killed at least 323 people in the Villa Luburiƒá, a slaughter house and place for torturing and imprisoning Serbs, Jews and political dissidents.  Expulsion and ethnic cleansing  Expulsions was one of the pillar of the Usta≈°e plan to create a pure Croat state. The first to be forced to leave were war veterans from the World War I Macedonian front who lived in Slavonia and Syrmia. By mid-1941, 5,000 Serbs had been expelled to German-occupied Serbia. The general plan was to have prominent people deported first, so their property could be nationalized and the remaining Serbs could then be more easily manipulated. By the end of September 1941, about half of the Serbian Orthodox clergy, 335 priests, had been expelled. Advocates of expulsion presented it as a necessary measure for the creation of a socially functional nation state, and also rationalized these plans by comparing it with the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The Usta≈°e set up holding camps, with the aim of gathering a large number of people and deporting them. The NDH government also formed the Office of Colonization to resettle Croats on reclaimed land. During the summer of 1941, the expulsions were carried out with the significant participation of the local population. Many representatives of local elites, including Bosnian Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Germans in Slavonia and Syrmia, played an active role in the expulsion. An estimated 120,000 Serbs were deported from the NDH to German-occupied Serbia, and 300,000 fled by 1943. By the end of July 1941 according to the German authorities in Serbia, 180,000 Serbs defected from the NDH to Serbia and by the end of September that number exceeded 200,000. In that same period 14,733 persons were legally relocated from the NDH to Serbia.In October 1941, organized migration was stopped because the German authorities in Serbia forbid further immigration of Serbs. According to documentation of the Commissariat for Refugees and Immigrants in Belgrade, in 1942 and 1943 illegal departures of individuals from NDH to Serbia still existed, numbering an estimated 200,000 though these figures are incomplete.  Religious persecution  Group of Serb civilians forcibly converted at a church in Glina, after which their throats were slit or heads bashed in, as part of a massacre campaign in the area. The Usta≈°e viewed religion and nationality as being closely linked; while Roman Catholicism and Islam (Bosnian Muslims were viewed as Croats) were recognized as Croatian national religions, Eastern Orthodoxy was deemed inherently incompatible with the Croatian state project. They saw Orthodoxy as hostile because it was identified as Serb. On 3 May 1941 a law was passed on religious conversions, pressuring Serbs to convert to Catholicism and thereby adopt Croat identity. This was made on the eve of Paveliƒá's meeting with Pope Pious XII in Rome. The Catholic Church in Croatia, headed by archbishop Aloysius Stepinac, greeted it and adopted it into the Church's internal law. The term \\"Serbian Orthodox\\" was banned in mid-May as being incompatible with state order, and the term \\"Greek-Eastern faith\\" was used in its place. By the end of September 1941, about half of the Serbian Orthodox clergy, 335 priests, had been expelled. Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Banja Luka by Usta≈°e Usta≈°e propaganda legitimized the persecution as being partially based on the historic Catholic‚ÄìOrthodox struggle for domination in Europe and Catholic intolerance towards the \\"schismatics\\". Following the Serb insurgency which was provoked by the Usta≈°e's reign of terror, killings and deportation campaign, the State Directorate for Regeneration launched a program in the autumn of 1941 which was aimed at the mass forced conversion of the Serbs. Already in the summer, the Usta≈°e had closed or destroyed most of the Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries and deported, imprisoned or murdered Orthodox priests and bishops. The conversions were meant to Croatianize and permanently destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church. Roman Catholic priest Krunoslav Draganoviƒá argued that many Catholics were converted to Orthodoxy during the 16th and 17th centuries, which was later used as the basis for the Usta≈°e conversion program. The Vatican was not opposed to the forced conversions. On 6 February 1942, Pope Pious XII privately received 206 Usta≈°e members in uniforms and blessed them, symbolically supporting their actions. On 8 February 1942 envoy to the Holy See Rusinoviƒá said that 'the Holy See joyed' over forced conversions., In a 21 February 1942 letter to Cardinal Luigi Maglione, the Holy See's secretary encouraged the Croatian bishops to speed up the conversions, and he also stated that the term \\"Orthodox\\" should be replaced with the terms \\"apostates or schismatics\\"., , Many fanatical Catholic priests joined the Usta≈°e, blessed and supported their work, and participated in killings and conversions. In 1941‚Äì1942, some 200,000 or 240,000, , , ‚Äì250,000 Serbs were converted to Roman Catholicism, although most of them only practiced it temporarily. Converts would sometimes be killed anyway, often in the same churches where they were re-baptized. 85% of the Serbian Orthodox clergy was killed or expelled. In Lika, Kordun and Banija alone, 172 Serbian Orthodox churches were closed, destroyed, or plundered. On 2 July 1942, the Croatian Orthodox Church was founded in order to replace the institutions of the Serbian Orthodox Church, after the matter of forced conversion had become extremely controversial. The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust described that the bishops' conference that met in Zagreb in November 1941 was not prepared to denounce the forced conversion of Serbs that had taken place in the summer of 1941, let alone condemn the persecution and murder of Serbs and Jews.Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, vol 1, p. 328. Many Catholic priests in Croatia approved of and supported the Usta≈°e's large scale attacks on the Serbian Orthodox Church, and the Catholic hierarchy did not issue any condemnation of the crimes, either publicly or privately. In fact, The Croatian Catholic Church and the Vatican viewed the Usta≈°e's policies against the Serbs as being advantageous to Roman Catholicism. = List of persecuted head officials of the Serbian Orthodox Church = Platon Jovanoviƒá's relics in the Church of the Holy Trinity, Banja Luka Bishops and metropolitans of the Serbian Orthodox Church dioceses in the Independent State of Croatia were targeted during religious persecutions: *Sava Trlajiƒá, the Bishop of the Eparchy of Gornji Karlovac ‚Äî tortured and killed in 1941 *Platon Jovanoviƒá, the Bishop of the Eparchy of Banja Luka ‚Äî tortured and killed in 1941 *Petar Zimonjiƒá, the Metropolitan of the Metropolitanate of Dabar-Bosna ‚Äî tortured and killed in 1941 *Dositej Vasiƒá, the Metropolitan of the Metropolitanate of Zagreb and Ljubljana ‚Äî died in 1945 as result of wounds from torture by Usta≈°e, before he was banished to Serbia *Nikola Jovanoviƒá, the Bishop of the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina ‚Äî died in 1944, after he was beaten by the Usta≈°e and expelled to Serbia *Irinej ƒêorƒëeviƒá, the Bishop of the Eparchy of Dalmatia ‚Äî interned to Italian captivity = The role of Aloysius Stepinac = A cardinal Aloysius Stepinac served as Archbishop of Zagreb during World War II and pledged his loyalty to the NDH. Scholars still debate the degree of Stepinac's contact with the Usta≈°e regime. Mark Biondich stated that he was not an ‚Äúardent supporter‚Äù of the Ustahsa regime legitimising their every policy, nor an ‚Äúavowed opponent‚Äù publicly denounced its crimes in a systematic manner. While some clergy committed war crimes in the name of the Catholic Church, Stepinac practiced a wary ambivalence. He was an early supporter of the goal of creating an Catholic Croatia, but soon began to question the regime's mandate of forced conversion. Historian Tomasevich praised his statements that were made against the Usta≈°e regime by Stepinac, as well as his actions against the regime. However, he also noted that these same statements and actions had shortcomings in respect to Usta≈°e's genocidal actions against the Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church. As Stepinac failed to publicly condemn the genocide waged against the Serbs by the Usta≈°e earlier during the war as he would later on. Tomasevich stated that Stepinac's courage against the Usta≈°e state earned him great admiration among anti-Usta≈°e Croats in his flock along with many others. However this came with the price of enmity of the Usta≈°e and Paveliƒá personally. In the early part of the war, he strongly supported a Yugoslavian state organized with federal lines. It was generally known that Stepinac and Pavloviƒá thoroughly hated each other. The Germans considered him Pro-Western and ‚Äúfriend of the Jews‚Äù leading to hostility from German and Italian forces. On 14 May 1941, Stepinac received word of an Usta≈°e massacre of Serb villagers at Glina. On the same day, he wrote to Paveliƒá saying: Aloysius Stepinac with two Catholic priests at the funeral of President of the NDH Parliament Marko Do≈°en in September 1944 > I consider it my bishop's responsibility to raise my voice and to say that > this is not permitted according to Catholic teaching, which is why I ask > that you undertake the most urgent measures on the entire territory of the > Independent State of Croatia, so that not a single Serb is killed unless it > is shown that he committed a crime warranting death. Otherwise, we will not > be able to count on the blessing of heaven, without which we must perish. These were still private protest letters. Later in 1942 and 1943, Stepinac started to speak out more openly against the Usta≈°e genocides, this was after most of the genocides were already committed, and it became increasingly clear the Nazis and Usta≈°e will be defeated. In May 1942, Stepinac spoke out against genocide, mentioning Jews and Roma, but not Serbs. Tomasevich wrote that while Stepinac is to be commended for his actions against the regime, the failure of the Croatian Catholic hierarchy and Vatican to publicly condemn the genocide \\"cannot be defended from the standpoint of humanity, justice and common decency\\". In his diary, Stepinac said that \\"Serbs and Croats are of two different worlds, north and south pole, which will never unite as long as one of them is alive\\", along with other similar views. Historian Ivo Goldstein described that Stepinac was being sympathetic to the Usta≈°e authorities and ambivalent towards the new racial laws, as well as that he was ‚Äúa man with many dilemmas in a disturbing time‚Äù. Stepinac resented the interwar conversion of some 200,000 most Croatian Catholics to Orthodoxy, which he felt was forced on them by prevailing political conditions. In 2016 Croatia's rehabilitation of Stepinac was negatively received in Serbia and Republika Srpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Toll of victims and genocide classification  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum website states that \\"Determining the number of victims for Yugoslavia, for Croatia, and for Jasenovac is highly problematic, due to the destruction of many relevant documents, the long-term inaccessibility to independent scholars of those documents that survived, and the ideological agendas of postwar partisan scholarship and journalism\\". In the 1980s, calculations of World War II victims in Yugoslavia were made by the Serb statistician Bogoljub Koƒçoviƒá and the Croat demographer Vladimir ≈Ωerjaviƒá. Tomasevich described their studies as being objective and reliable. Koƒçoviƒá estimated that 370,000 Serbs, both combatants and civilians, died in the NDH during the war. With a possible error of around 10%, he noted that Serb losses cannot be higher than 410,000. He did not estimate the number of Serbs who were killed by the Usta≈°e, saying that in most cases, the task of categorizing the victims would be impossible. ≈Ωerjaviƒá estimated that the total number of Serb deaths in the NDH was 322,000, of which 125,000 died as combatants, while 197,000 were civilians. ≈Ωerjaviƒá estimated that a total of 78,000 civilians were killed in Usta≈°e prisons, pits and camps, including Jasenovac, 45,000 civilians were killed by the Germans, 15,000 civilians were killed by the Italians, 34,000 civilians were killed in battles between the warring parties, and 25,000 civilians died of typhoid. The number of victims who perished in the Jasenovac concentration camp remains a matter of debate, but current estimates put the total number at around 100,000, about half of whom were Serbs. During the war as well as during Tito's Yugoslavia, various numbers were given for Yugoslavia's overall war casualties. Estimates by Holocaust memorial centers also vary. The historian Jozo Tomasevich said that the exact number of victims in Yugoslavia is impossible to determine. The academic Barbara Jelavich however cites Tomasevich's estimate in writing that as many as 350,000 Serbs were killed during the period of Usta≈°e rule. The historian Rory Yeomans said that the most conservative estimates state that 200,000 Serbs were killed by Usta≈°e death squads but the actual number of Serbs who were executed by the Usta≈°e or perished in Usta≈°e concentration camps may be as high as 500,000. In a 1992 work, Sabrina P. Ramet cites the figure of 350,000 Serbs who were \\"liquidated\\" by \\"Paveliƒá and his Usta≈°e henchmen\\". In a 2006 work, Ramet estimated that at least 300,000 Serbs were \\"massacred by the Usta≈°e\\". In her 2007 book \\"The Independent State of Croatia 1941-45\\", Ramet cites ≈Ωerjaviƒá's overall figures for Serb losses in the NDH. Marko Attila Hoare writes that \\"perhaps nearly 300,000 Serbs\\" died as a result of the Usta≈°e genocide and the Nazi policies. Raphael Lemkin, the initiator of the Genocide Convention described the Usta≈°e crimes against Serbs as genocide Tomislav Duliƒá stated that Serbs in NDH suffered among the highest casualty rates in Europe during the World War II. The genocide scholar Israel Charny lists the Independent State of Croatia as the third most lethal regime in the twentieth century, killing an average of 2.51% of its citizens per year. Charny's definition of domestic democide doesn't only include genocide, but also politicide and mass murder, as well as forced deportation causing deaths and famine or epidemic during which regime withhold aid or act in a way to make it more deadly. American historian Stanley G. Payne stated that direct and indirect executions by NDH regime were an ‚Äúextraordinary mass crime‚Äù, which in proportionate terms exceeded any other European regime beside Hitler's Third Reich. He added the crimes in the NDH were proportionately surpassed only by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and several of the extremely genocidal African regimes. Raphael Israeli wrote that ‚Äúa large scale genocidal operations, in proportions to its small population, remain almost unique in the annals of wartime Europe.‚Äù In Serbia as well as in the eyes of Serbs, the Usta≈°e atrocities constituted a genocide., , , , , Many historians and authors describe the Usta≈°e regime's mass killings of Serbs as meeting the definition of genocide, including Raphael Lemkin who is known for coining the word genocide and initiating the Genocide Convention., , , , , , , Croatian historian Mirjana Kasapoviƒá explained that in the most important scientific works on genocide, crimes against Serbs, Jews and Roma in the NDH are unequivocally classified as genocide. Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, stated that ‚ÄúUstasha carried out a Serb genocide, exterminating over 500,000, expelling 250,000, and forcing another 250,000 to convert to Catholicism‚Äù. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, also, mentioned that leaders of the Independent State of Croatia committed genocide against Serbs, Jews, and Roma. Presidents of Croatia, Stjepan Mesiƒá and Ivo Josipoviƒá, as well as Bakir Izetbegoviƒá and ≈Ωeljko Kom≈°iƒá, Bosniak and Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, also described the persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia as a genocide. In the post-war era, the Serbian Orthodox Church considered the Serbian victims of this genocide to be martys. As a result, the Serbian Orthodox Church commemorates the Holy New Martys of Jasenovac Concentration Camp on 13 September.  Aftermath  The Yugoslav communist authorities did not use the Jasenovac camp as was done with other European concentration camps, most likely due to Serb-Croat relations. They recognized that ethnic tensions stemming from the war could had the capacity to destabilize the new communist regime, tried to conceal wartime atrocities and to mask specific ethnic losses. The Tito's government attempted to let the wounds heal and forge \\"brotherhood and unity\\" in the peoples. Tito himself was invited to, and passed Jasenovac several times, but never visited the site. The genocide was not properly examined in the aftermath of the war, because the Yugoslav communist government did not encourage independent scholars. Historians Marko Attila Hoare and Mark Biondich stated that Western world historians don't pay enough attention to the genocide committed by Usta≈°e, while several scholars described it as lesser-known genocide. World War II and especially its ethnic conflicts have been deemed instrumental in the later Yugoslav Wars (1991‚Äì95)., , , = Trials = Mile Budak and a number of other members of the NDH government, such as Nikola Mandiƒá and Julije Makanec, were tried and convicted of high treason and war crimes by the communist authorities of the SFR Yugoslavia. Many of them were executed.MARTINA GRAHEK RAVANƒåIƒÜ, Izruƒçenja i sudbine zarobljenika smje≈°tenih u savezniƒçkim logorima u svibnju 1945, Hrvatski institut za povijest, Zagreb, Republika Hrvatska.Nada Kisiƒá Kolanoviƒá. \\"Politiƒçki procesi u Hrvatskoj neposredno nakon Drugoga svjetskoga rata\\", 1945 - Razdjelnica hrvatske povijesti, Zbornik radova sa znanstvenog skupa u Hrvatskom institutu za povijest u Zagrebu 1-6, svibnja 2006, pp. 75-97, see pg. 85; . Miroslav Filipoviƒá, the commandant of the Jasenovac and Stara Gradi≈°ka camps, was found guilty for war crimes, sentenced to death and hanged. Ljubo Milo≈° en route to his trial Many others escaped, including the supreme leader Ante Paveliƒá, most to Latin America. Some emigrations were prevented by the Operation Gvardijan, in which Ljubo Milo≈°, the commandant of the Jasenovac camp was captured and executed. Aloysius Stepinac, who served as Archbishop of Zagreb was found guilty of high treason and forced conversion of Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism. However, some claim the trial was \\"carried out with proper legal procedure\\". In its judgment in the Hostages Trial, the Nuremberg Military Tribunal concluded that the Independent State of Croatia was not a sovereign entity capable of acting independently of the German military, despite recognition as an independent state by the Axis powers. According to the Tribunal, \\"Croatia was at all times here involved an occupied country\\". The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide were not in force at the time. It was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 9 December 1948 and entered into force on 12 January 1951. Andrija Artukoviƒá, Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Justice of the NDH who signed a number of racial laws, escaped to the United States after the war and he was extradited to Yugoslavia in 1986, where he was tried in the Zagreb District Court and was found guilty of a number of mass killings in the NDH. Artukoviƒá was sentenced to death, but the sentence was not carried out due to his age and health. Efraim Zuroff, a Nazi hunter, played a significant role in capturing Dinko ≈†akiƒá, another the Jasenovac camp commander, during 1990s. After pressure from the international community on the right-wing president Franjo Tuƒëman, he sought ≈†akiƒá's extradition and he stood trial in Croatia, aged 78; he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and given the maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. According to the human rights researchers Eric Stover, Victor Peskin and Alexa Koenig it was \\"the most important post-Cold War domestic effort to hold criminally accountable a Nazi war crimes suspect in a former Eastern European communist country\\". = Ratlines, terrorism and assassinations = With the Partisan liberation of Yugoslavia, many Usta≈°e leaders fled and took refuge at the college of San Girolamo degli Illirici near the Vatican. Catholic priest and Usta≈°e Krunoslav Draganoviƒá directed the fugitives from San Girolamo. The US State Department and Counter-Intelligence Corps helped war criminals to escape, and assisted Draganoviƒá (who later worked for the American intelligence) in sending Usta≈°e abroad. Many of those responsible for mass killings in NDH took refuge in South America, Portugal, Spain and the United States. Luburiƒá was assassinated in Spain in 1969 by an UDBA agent; Artukoviƒá lived in Ireland and California until extradited in 1986 and died of natural causes in prison; Dinko ≈†akiƒá and his wife Nada lived in Argentina until extradited in 1998, Dinko dying in prison and his wife released. Draganoviƒá also arranged Gestapo functionary Klaus Barbie's flight. Among some of the Croat diaspora, the Usta≈°e became heroes. Usta≈°e √©migr√© terrorist groups in the diaspora (such as Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood and Croatian National Resistance) carried out assassinations and bombings, and also plane hijackings, throughout the Yugoslav period.  Controversy and denial  = Historical revisionism = Some Croats, including politicians, have attempted to minimise the magnitude of the genocide perpetrated against Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia. Historian Mirjana Kasapoviƒá concluded that there are three main strategies of historical revisionism in the part of Croatian historiography: the NDH was a normal counter-insurgency state at the time; no mass crimes were committed in the NDH, especially genocide; the Jasenovac camp was just a labor camp, not an extermination camp. By 1989, the future President of Croatia, Franjo Tuƒëman had embraced Croatian nationalism and published Horrors of War: Historical Reality and Philosophy, in which he questioned the official number of victims killed by the Usta≈°e during the Second World War. In his book,Tuƒëman claimed that between 30,000 and 40,000 died at Jasenovac. Some scholars and observers accused Tuƒëman of racist statements, ‚Äúflirting with ideas associated with the Usta≈°e movement‚Äù, appointment of former Usta≈°e officials to political and military positions, as well as downplaying the number of victims in the Independent State of Croatia. Since 2016, anti-fascist groups, leaders of Croatia's Serb, Roma and Jewish communities and former top Croat officials have boycotted the official state commemoration for the victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp because, as they said, Croatian authorities refused to denounce the Usta≈°e legacy explicitly and they downplayed and revitalized crimes committed by Usta≈°e. = Destruction of memorials = After Croatia gained independence, about 3,000 monuments dedicated to the anti-fascist resistance and the victims of fascism were destroyed. According to Croatian World War II veterans' association, these destructions were not spontaneous, but a planned activity carried out by the ruling party, the state and the church. The status of the Jasenovac Memorial Site was downgraded to the nature park, and parliament cut its funding. In September 1991, Croatian forces entered the memorial site and vandalized the museum building, while exhibitions and documentation were destroyed, damaged and looted. In 1992, FR Yugoslavia sent a formal protest to the United Nations and UNESCO, warning of the devastation of the memorial complex. The European Community Monitor Mission visited the memorial center and confirmed the damage.  Commemoration  An exhibition dedicated to the Jasenovac victims, Banja Luka Israeli President Moshe Katsav visited Jasenovac in 2003. His successor, Shimon Peres, paid homage to the camp's victims when he visited Jasenovac on 25 July 2010 and laid a wreath at the memorial. Peres dubbed the Usta≈°e's crimes a \\"demonstration of sheer sadism\\". The Jasenovac Memorial Museum reopened in November 2006 with a new exhibition designed by a Croatian architect, Helena Paver Njiriƒá, and an Educational Center, designed by the firm Produkcija. The Memorial Museum features an interior of rubber- clad steel modules, video and projection screens, and glass cases displaying artifacts from the camp. Above the exhibition space, which is quite dark, is a field of glass panels inscribed with the names of the victims. The New York City Parks Department, the Holocaust Park Committee and the Jasenovac Research Institute, with the help of then-Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY), established a public monument to the victims of Jasenovac in April 2005 (the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the camps.) The dedication ceremony was attended by ten Yugoslavian Holocaust survivors, as well as diplomats from Serbia, Bosnia and Israel. It remains the only public monument to Jasenovac victims outside the Balkans. Memorial museum for victims of massacre in Stari Brod, Rogatica Nowadays, –æn 22 April, the anniversary of the prisoner breakout from the Jasenovac camp, Serbia marks the National Holocaust, World War II Genocide and other Fascist Crimes Victims Remembrance Day, while Croatia holds an official commemoration at the Jasenovac Memorial Site. Serbia and Bosnian entity of Republika Srpska hold a joint central commemoration at the Donja Gradina Memorial Zone. In 2018, an exhibition named ‚ÄúJasenovac ‚Äì The Right to Remembrance‚Äù was held in the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City within the marking of International Holocaust Remembrance Day, with the main goal of to foster a culture of remembrance of Serb, Jewish, Roma and anti-fascist victims of the Holocaust and genocide in the Jasenovac camp. On 22 April 2020, the president of Serbia Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá had an official visit to the memorial park in Sremska Mitrovica, dedicated to the victims of genocide on the territory of Syrmia. Commemoration ceremonies honoring the victims of the Jadovno concentration camp have been organized by the Serb National Council (SNV), the Jewish community in Croatia, and local anti- fascists since 2009, while 24 June has been designated as a \\"Day of Remembrance of the Jadovno Camp\\" in Croatia. On 26 August 2010, the 68th anniversary of the partial liberation of the Jastrebarsko children's camp, victims were commemorated in a ceremony at a monument in the Jastrebarsko cemetery. It was attended by only 40 people, mainly members of the Union of Anti-Fascist Fighters and Anti-Fascists of the Republic of Croatia. The Republic of Srpska Government holds a commemoration at the memorial site of the victims of the Usta≈°e massacres in the Drina Valley.

In all he smuggled some 200,000 books for pupils, priests, teachers and peasants; he used several routes to pass through the FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü Mountains. He was born in Opra Kertsesora, Kingdom of Hungary (, today part of C√¢r»õi»ôoara, Romania), the second child of poor peasants (Nicolae and Ludovica) who were former serfs, and he spent his childhood tending sheep at the edge of his village. In between his later brushes with fame, he would always return to this activity. He became the head of his family on 2 October 1865 with the death of his father. Badea C√¢r»õan at Rome, at the base of Trajan Column. C√¢r≈£an first crossed the mountains into the Romanian Old Kingdom with his sheep and a friend at the age of 18, and it was at that time that his interest in Romanian national unity became powerful. In 1877 he enrolled as a volunteer in the Romanian War of Independence, serving until 1881. In 1895 he travelled to V√°c and Szeged to visit imprisoned Romanians, including the signatories of the Transylvanian Memorandum. Badea C√¢r»õan himself was arrested twice: once because he asked the Emperor-King Franz Joseph at Vienna for Transylvania's self-determination, and once because he asked the authorities for permission to sell Romanian books. C√¢r»õan made a journey on foot to Rome, and when he arrived at the city's edge after 45 days, said, \\"Bine te-am gƒÉsit, maica Roma\\" (\\"Pleased to meet you, mother Rome\\"). He wished to see Trajan's Column with his own eyes, as well as other evidences of the Latin origin of the Romanian people. After pouring Romanian soil and wheat at the column's base, he wrapped himself in a peasant's coat (cojoc) and fell asleep at the column's base. The next day he was awakened by a policeman who shouted in amazement, \\"A Dacian has fallen off the column!\\", as C√¢r≈£an was dressed just like the Dacians carved into the column; the event was reported in Roman newspapers and Duiliu Zamfirescu, Romanian representative in Italy, showed him around the city and introduced him to its important personalities. This January-February 1896 trip was but one of three visits to Rome; on his last, in October 1899, on the occasion of a meeting of the International Congress of Orientalists, he laid a wreath at the column's base. C√¢r»õan also visited France, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Egypt and Jerusalem. He was buried in Sinaia, on soil belonging to the Kingdom of Romania (Transylvania still being seven years away from the declaration of the union with Romania); on the stone cross atop his grave is inscribed the phrase: \\"Aici doarme Badea C√¢r»õan vis√¢nd √Æntregirea neamului sƒÉu\\" (\\"Here lies Badea C√¢r»õan dreaming of the unity of his people\\").

He was a member of the Roman family of the Orsini. Biography The son of Girolamo Orsini and Francesca Sforza, he was grandson, on his father's side, of Felice della Rovere (illegitimate daughter of Pope Julius II) and Gian Giordano Orsini and, on his mother's side, of Count Bosio Sforza and Costanza Farnese, an illegitimate daughter of Pope Paul III. On 3 September 1558 he married Isabella de' Medici, daughter of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, at Poggio a Caiano.Murphy 2008 pp. 65-66 Paolo Giordano lived mostly in Rome and his castle at Bracciano, rather than with his wife, who stayed mostly at Florence. In 1571 he took part in the battle of Lepanto. A year later, in October 1572, he served as a general of the Spanish infantry, in a campaign that tried to reclaim the garrison of Navarino in the Peloponnese.Murphy 2008 pp. 221-222 On 16 July 1576 his wife died unexpectedly at the Medici villa of Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday.

She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees, having immediately fallen dead.\\"Murphy 2008 p. 324 This official version of events was not generally believed, and the Ferrarese ambassador, Ercole Cortile, obtained information that Isabella was \\"strangled at midday\\" by her husband in the presence of several named servants.Murphy 2008 pp. 324-325 Isabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family, her cousin Leonora having died of a similar \\"accident\\" only a few days before.Murphy 2008 pp. 316-324 Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed his wife, in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with his cousin Troilo Orsini, or that he acted on instructions of Isabella's brother, the grandduke.Murphy 2008 pp. 328-333 One scholar, Elisabetta Mori, has argued that Isabella de' Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici.Mori After these events Paolo Giordano returned to Rome, where he started a relationship with Vittoria Accoramboni, wife of Francesco Peretti, the nephew of the future Pope Sixtus V. Peretti was assassinated, it was believed by Paolo Giordano's order, in April 1581. Wanted by both the Papal and Florentine police, Paolo Giordano took refuge in northern Italy, first in Venice and then in Abano and Sal√≤ with his mistress, whom he married on 20 April 1585. He died at Sal√≤ on 13 November 1585.Herman 2013 pp. 315-316; 325-326 On 22 December Vittoria was herself assassinated by Ludovico Orsini of the Monterotondo line, on the instigation of Grand Duke Francesco.Herman 2013 pp. 345-347, 374 The Medici (Francesco and Cardinal Ferdinando) wished to secure movable assets in possession of Vittoria for their nephew Virginio Orsini, Paolo Giordano's son from his first marriage and principal heir.

Following the suppression of the Janissaries in 1826, Sultan Mahmud II transferred the functions of the old Agha of the Janissaries to the serasker. The latter now became a distinct office at the head of the Ottoman military, combining the functions of a commander-in-chief and a minister of war. He also took over the Janissary Agha's former duties regarding the upkeep of order in Istanbul. Indeed, as the police system developed and expanded with the empire's progressive centralization, it became one of the main duties of the serasker until 1845, when it became a separate agency. The seat of the serasker and his department (bab-i seraskeri, or serasker kapƒ±sƒ±‚Äî\\"Gate of the serasker\\") initially was in the Eski Saray, but were transferred to dedicated buildings in 1865.

It has been responsible for several innovations in prosthetics, including the C-Leg, a computerized knee joint that adaptively varies its passive resistance to suit the patient's different walking gaits, and the Michelangelo Hand, a fully articulated robotic hand prosthesis. In 2017, the company bought Bebionic, the high technology robotic hand, from the Steeper, US company that developed prosthesis, and has become the most high- tech company in upper extremities. Ottobock has been a partner to the Paralympic Games since 1988, and an international worldwide partner to the International Paralympic Committee since 2005. In 2016, the partnership was extended until the end of 2020. History Ottobock was founded in Berlin as Orthop√§dische Industrie GmbH in 1919 by its namesake prosthetist, Otto Bock. It was created in response to the large number of injured veterans from World War I. Prostheses handmade by craftsmen could not keep up with demand. Bock's idea was to create components through industrial processes that could be supplied to prosthetists. This marked the beginning of a new industry. The political situation in post-war Berlin was unstable, and soon after the company was founded, it moved to K√∂nigsee in Thuringia. Over the following two decades, the company expanded to employ over 600 people. Science Center Medizintechnik in Berlin After World War II, K√∂nigsee lay within the Russian- occupied East Germany. The company property and assets there were expropriated in 1948. However, Max and Maria N√§der, Bock's son-in-law and daughter, had established an office in Duderstadt in Lower Saxony, initially as a sales office for the zones of Germany occupied by the Western powers. In 1947, Max N√§der became the managing director of the newly formed Otto Bock Orthop√§dische Industrie KG. Otto Bock died in 1953. The company has been responsible for several innovations in prosthetics. As wood was in short supply in the early post-war years, it pioneered the use of polyurethane to manufacture prosthetics. Otto Bock Kunststoff was founded in 1953 to produce plastic prosthetics. By 2016, it employed 423 people and anticipated revenues of ‚Ç¨127 million. Ottobock developed the pyramid adapter, a highly adjustable linkage for prosthetic parts. In 1997, it introduced the C-Leg, a computerized knee that adaptively varies its passive resistance to suit the patients' different walking gaits. It was the world's first fully microprocessor-controlled leg prosthesis system, and transformed the company into a vendor of highly complex mobility systems. The C-Leg was followed by the Michelangelo Hand, a fully articulated robotic hand prosthesis, and the mechatronic C-Brace orthotronic mobility system. Ottobock developed the waterproof Genium X3 knee in cooperation with the United States Department of Defense to allow amputee soldiers to return to duty. In 1958, a US-based corporate headquarters was established in Minneapolis, Minnesota under the name Ottobock. In March 2014, the company announced it would relocate its North American headquarters to Austin, Texas. The logistics facility relocated to Louisville, Kentucky, and manufacturing moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. The US company was its first foreign branch. By 2016, it had branches in 45 different countries. Sycor was established as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1998. By 2015, it had 520 employees, and annual revenues of ‚Ç¨66.7 million. Professor Hans Georg N√§der became head of the company in 1990. In 1992, after the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent German reunification, the N√§der family re-purchased the land in K√∂nigsee that had been expropriated in 1948, and established a new wheelchair manufacturing facility and logistics centre there. A medical science centre () was built by the company in Berlin in 2009 to celebrate 90 years since its foundation. Max N√§der died that year at the age of 94. By 2015, with a work force of 6,300 and annual sales of ‚Ç¨771 million, the company was valued at ‚Ç¨2.5 billion. In February 2017 Ottobock acquired BeBionic. In June 2017, EQT purchased a 20% stake in Ottobock.  Paralympic Games  An Ottobock technician repairs a wheelchair at the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ottobock has been a partner to the Paralympic Games since 1988, and an international worldwide partner to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) since 2005. The 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro was the 13th games at which it provided technical services. This involved shipping of equipment, including 250 items classed as hazardous good or dangerous chemicals, and 15,000 spare parts, including 1,100 wheelchair tyres, 70 running blades and 300 prosthetic feet, from Duderstadt to the port at Bremerhaven, by sea to Santos, and then by road to Rio de Janeiro. At Seoul in 1988, four Ottobock technicians carried out 350 repairs; in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, 100 technicians from 29 countries speaking 26 languages carried out 3,361 repairs for 1,162 athletes, including 2,745 repairs to wheelchairs, 438 to prosthetics, and 178 to orthodics. By 2016, Ottobock was the IPC's longest- serving partner. In Rio on 10 September, the IPC's president, Sir Philip Craven, announced that Ottobock had agreed to extend its world-wide partnership to the end of 2020, encompassing the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo.

The locality is within the Bowen Basin coalfields and there are a number of active coal mines in the locality, including Foxleigh, Oak Park and Lake Lindsay coal mines with other areas being considered for future mines. Railway lines for the Blackwater rail system pass through the south of the locality. However, the mines within the locality are not serviced by these lines but via the lines in neighbouring Middlemount. The Fitzroy Developmental Road passes from south-east to north-west through the locality.

The lyrics open with the image of a child sleeping \\"in the glow of [a] Donald Duck light\\",To Kill the Child lyrics a reference to Waters' prior song \\"The Tide Is Turning.\\" Waters goes on to ask why a culture whose primary concerns are luxury, consumption and petty values would \\"kill the child\\". The song ends with a plea to protect children from the crusade-waging \\"bigots and bully boys / Slugging it out in the yard.\\" \\"Leaving Beirut\\" The second track of the single runs at 12 minutes and 29 seconds. Most of the song's lyrics are derived from a short story about Waters' hitchhiking excursion in Lebanon when he was a teenager. These passages, intoned in monologue over a descending synthesizer ostinato, are interspersed with more recently penned refrains outlining Waters' reaction to United States and United Kingdom involvement in the Iraq War. Waters performed the song at every show on his The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour, replacing the spoken-word recitation with a visual backdrop of the story as a graphic novel. =Controversy and criticism= Waters' condemnation of George W. Bush (at one point, the song's lyrics claim \\"that Texas education must have fucked [him] up\\")Leaving Beirut lyrics received negative reactions from audience members during his show at New Jersey's PNC Bank Arts Center on 6 September 2006, at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 12 September 2006 and in Tampa, Florida on 19 May 2007; however, audience reactions during the 5 October 2006 performance at the Hollywood Bowl were overwhelmingly positive, with many patrons rising to their feet and cheering. The song also received a positive reaction during its American performances at the Boston, Massachusetts and Camden, New Jersey Tweeter Centers, in New York on 30 May 2007, as well as in other cities worldwide, particularly Mumbai and Dubai.Ian Ritchie's tour blog Ironically, during his first show in Dallas, Texas on 2 May 2008, the line referring to George Bush and the Texas education was met with uproarious applause. His last show on the American leg of the tour, in Houston on the 4th, was met with a fairly mixed reaction. While many fans have embraced the song's lyrical content, which is sympathetic towards the people of Lebanon, some have objected to Waters' political stance. In 2006, Waters performed a concert in Neve Shalom, Israel in front of a crowd of 50,000. During the concert, which included \\"Leaving Beirut\\" in the set-list, Waters expressed his belief that Israel had to \\"tear down the walls\\" of the Israeli West Bank barrier (pictured in the single's cover art) to make peace with its neighbours.Press release The morning after Waters' concert in Neve Shalom, editorial writer Ben Dror Yemini wrote in the Israel newspaper Maariv: The song has also received some criticism for its musical content and style; one review of the 10 October show at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California claimed that the song \\"floundered\\" musically despite being lyrically \\"one of Waters' best post-Floyd works.\\"San Jose Mercury News References Category:2004 singles Category:Roger Waters songs Category:Protest songs Category:Songs critical of religion Category:Songs of the Iraq War Category:Songs about cities Category:Songs about Lebanon Category:Songs written by Roger Waters Category:Songs based on actual events Category:Anti-war songs Category:2004 songs Category:Columbia Records singles ","title":"To Kill the Child/Leaving Beirut"},{"id":"7701630","text":"Max Gordon may refer to: *Max Gordon (Village Vanguard founder), founder of the Village Vanguard jazz club *Max Gordon (producer), New York theatre and film producer ","title":"Max Gordon"},{"id":"7701631","text":"John Plessington (c. 1637 ‚Äì 19 July 1679), also known as John Plesington, William Scarisbrick and William Pleasington, was an English Catholic priest who was executed by the English Crown for violating the ban on the presence of Catholic priests in the kingdom. He is now honored as one of the Roman Catholic Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.List of 40 martyrs , accessed 20 July 2008 Life He was born at Dimples Hall, Garstang, Lancashire, the son of Robert Plessington, a Royalist Roman Catholic, and Alice Rawstone, a family thus persecuted for both their religious and political beliefs. He was educated by the Jesuits at Scarisbrick Hall, then at the Royal College of Saint Alban at Valladolid, Spain, and then at Saint Omer Seminary in France. He was ordained in Segovia, Spain, on 25 March 1662. He returned to England in 1663 ministering to covert Catholics in the areas of Holywell and Cheshire, often hiding under the name John Scarisbrick. He was also tutor at Puddington Old Hall near Chester. Upon arrest in Chester during the Popish Plot scare caused by Titus Oates, he was imprisoned for two months, and then hanged, drawn and quartered for the crime of being a Catholic priest. From the scaffold at Gallow's Hill in Boughton, Cheshire, he spoke the following: : Plessington was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI, and canonized and made one of the Forty Martyrs on 25 October 1970 by Pope Paul VI. There is now a school called St. John Plessington in England which won TES School of the Year 2010 out of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. Memorial There is a memorial tablet to him located in the entrance porch of St Werburgh's Catholic Church, Grosvenor Park Road, Chester, just a short distance from the spot he was executed on. In 1980 his name was added to the base of the granite obelisk nearby that was erected in 1898 for the Protestant martyr George Marsh in Boughton, which has the following inscription: Remains In the early 21st century, a set of human bones found in an old trunk in Wales came to be regarded as possibly being Plessington's remains. They had been found in the late 19th century, wrapped in 17th-century clothing, in a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, which had been known to be a secret gathering place for the Catholics of the region to worship covertly. This had been the region where he had carried out his ministry before his arrest. Showing signs of violence, the bones had been considered those of some anonymous martyrs of the period and entrusted to a community of the Society of Jesus in nearby Tremeirchion. When a grave believed to have been Plessington's was opened in 1962 as part of the process for his beatification, it was found to contain the remains of a younger man. Interest later focused on this set of remains. In 2015, Mark Davies, Roman Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury, started a campaign to raise the funds for the testing of the DNA of the bones.

When Charlie is singled out as the least popular senior on the very first day of school, kindly outcast Billie amiably agrees to show him the ropes and provide him with an illuminating crash course in the clique system. Meanwhile, Lori is shocked to discover that dancing has been banned in her new town and the only place to cut loose is at the clandestine dance sessions held in the garage of current janitor and former dance instructor Gabriel. Immediately forbidden from attending the highly secretive shindigs, Lori stealthily sneaks out to be with the kindly Gabriel as her feelings for the dance instructor grow and the pair set into motion a clever plan to usher in a new era of dancing around town.

Produced by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani, it stars Farhan Akhtar and Konkana Sen Sharma in lead roles. Rishi Kapoor, Alyy Khan, Juhi Chawla, Dimple Kapadia, Hrithik Roshan, Isha Sharvani, and Sanjay Kapoor feature in the supporting roles. Guest stars and industry folk starring as themselves included Abhishek Bachchan, Akshaye Khanna, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Kareena Kapoor, Karan Johar, Manish Malhotra, Ranbir Kapoor, John Abraham, Vivek Oberoi, Rajkumar Hirani, Boman Irani and Anurag Kashyap in cameos. The film is about the journey of an actor who arrives in Mumbai to become a movie star. How he finds himself riding his fortune to becoming one, while struggling to sustain his relationships, forms the story. The film, which was released on 30 January 2009, did not perform well at the box office. Plot Young actor Vikram Jaisingh (Farhan Akhtar) arrives in Mumbai to make it as a Bollywood film star with the help of Abhimanyu (Arjun Mathur), an actor friend from his hometown, and their mutual friend Sameer, who works in a studio props department. Vikram befriends Abhimanyu's neighbor, young actress Sona Mishra (Konkona Sen Sharma), with whom he eventually becomes romantically involved. Sona, the mistress of small- time producer Satish Chowdhury (Alyy Khan), who for three years has promised her a leading role in his dream project, meanwhile works in regional films and bit parts. Sona finds out that Satish has secured financing for the new project and meets him expecting him to cast her as second heroine, but he refuses to say that they need a new face and since she has acted in many regional films and other small roles she is no longer a fresh face. She argues that she can act well but he says that is not a major criterion these days in Bollywood. Sona is crying when Satish's wife enters and asks her why she is crying. Sona answers by fabricating a lie about trouble at home to save both her and Satish's embarrassment. Sona while leaving the both of them gives photos of Vikram to Satish who shows it to his wife and who in turn shows them to Romy (Rishi Kapoor). Vikram is shortlisted for Romy's new movie. Neena (Dimple Kapadia), the mom of Nikki (Isha Sharvani), the actress cast for the movie, was a big film actress in the heyday. She sees Vikram's audition and tries to remember where has she met him before. Vikram had once approached her at a film fraternity party. Vikram is told his audition was for the lead in the film and that Neena has seen his audition. At home, he sees every movie Neena has starred in and he impresses her with his charm and knowledge about her work. Recalling past advice, Vikram successfully boosts a competing actor's ego whose overconfident acting is rejected by the director. Finally, Vikram is selected by Neena, Ranjit (director of the film Sanjay Kapoor), and Romy's wife (Juhi Chawla), despite Romy's desire to cast the other macho, hunky actor. On set, Vikram becomes increasingly crafty and manipulative, while Nikki is smitten by him and sneaks into his room one night while her mother is asleep in an attempt to seduce him. Vikram succumbs to her advances and a secret affair starts between the two; the affair becomes stronger when Neena has to leave the set on business for a few days. Vikram tells Nikki he has no girlfriend. Meanwhile, Sona arrives at the hotel where the cast is staying to surprise Vikram. Her friend who is also working on the film warns her of a blossoming romance between Vikram and Nikki. Since Vikram has stayed in touch with her, Sona doesn't take heed of her friend's warning but discovers the truth when she sees Vikram's unexpectedly cold behavior towards her. Hurt, she leaves the hotel. After coming back, Neena instantly recognizes that something is going on between them and makes them understand that it will be mutually beneficial not to let the press and public know of their intimacy. Meanwhile, in Mumbai, news of the affair has leaked and a friend of Sona who works at a tabloid is assigned to prepare the article, which describes Vikram as a user who has shot to stardom by manipulating Neena and her daughter Nikki. The article also mentions details of when he was struggling to land a role and Sona's part in his life as the forgotten girlfriend. Neena gets very upset and yells at the magazine editor and tells Nikki to stay away from Vikram. Vikram and Nikki have a fight, and Vikram shows his frustration to Sona as he believes she is the one responsible for the article. Eventually the film is released and it becomes a hit. Vikram rises to stardom but at the expense of his friends. At a party, he meets his idol Shah Rukh Khan, who advises him to not fall into the trappings of stardom and to always stay close to the people who stood by him when he was a nobody. He tries to get back with Sona, but she points out that he only wants to be with her because he is selfish and feels guilty. She refuses and walks out of his life. Sona soon gets good roles on television and is interviewed by a reporter for her fan following. The film ends with her telling the reporter that she is happy living the life of an independent and somewhat successful actress instead of being upset about not becoming a major movie star.

In an interview she said: > I hand wrote it and it was some ridiculous, epic-length when I came back and > transcribed it on my laptop. The first film is the easiest to write because > it's usually what the person knows their personal graphs, milieu and > feelings. Luck By Chance is not about established actors, but those who are > waiting for things to happen. Farhan's character is fresh off the boat, > while Konkana's does bit roles, looking for a big break. The production team went through a host of names, like Rani Mukerji, Madhuri Dixit, Saif Ali Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Kajol Devgn, and Tabu. Having seen a lot of struggling actors come to Mumbai to make a living out of Bollywood, Zoya found it was easy to write the script for the film without any research. She was inspired to write this movie by a lot of Bollywood-inspired movies like Guddi, Rangeela, and Om Shanti Om. Javed Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film, incorporating, as Zoya puts it, his bizarre sense of humour. Farhan had to reportedly train to get six pack abs for the film. He was trained by Cheetah Yagnesh, who appeared on the film as Farhan's character's trainer. Filming faced a lot of problems, including the unpredictable Mumbai rains, which halted a song shoot with Hrithik Roshan. The rains washed out the entire set, and eventually the entire tent began to leak. Zoya was afraid that this would lead to short-circuit, and so all the lights had to be switched off.Luck by Chance turns unlucky, Oneindia.in, Retrieved on 2009-01-30 According to Farhan, principal photography for the film was completed in October. =Casting= Zoya Akhtar cast her brother Farhan to play the lead role after it was suggested to her by director Reema Kagti. She became convinced after seeing Farhan's performance in The Fakir of Venice. She said in an interview, \\"Farhan was the perfect choice for the role in Luck By Chance because he knows the industry in and out. He is smart and bright and both of us have been working together for years\\". Problems arose with the huge casting of the film. Zoya said, \\"I had to really think it out when I was deciding on these multiple actors that I wanted in the film. It was tough to decide especially because I wanted the right actors who could play themselves and still look believable as part of the film. Then there are other good actors like Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla, who are playing characters in the film\\". Next to be cast were her parents, Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi, along with such veteran stars as Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia. Zoya said, \\"We could have had Shabana (Azmi) as the diva, but I needed a mainstream heroine. Only a leading lady would do. Dimple has played it edgy. She's all warm, soft sunshine and then there's a flip and she's hard, cold, steely\\". Isha Sharvani teams up again with Hrithik Roshan after appearing together in an ad. Juhi Chawla joined the cast playing Minty, the wife of producer Rommy Rolly. =Promotion= The producers decided to go with subtle promotion, letting audiences explore the film by themselves. The main trailer for the movie was released in the last week of December. It introduced the main characters and set the pace for what the plot was about. BigFlix, a part of Reliance BIG Entertainment Ltd., was given the task of promoting the movie. The first bit of promotion came from the music wherein winners were given signed albums by Farhan Akhtar and Konkona Sen Sharma. They promoted the whole movie across the nation in all 112 stores in 10 cities as well to the international audiences through its video-on-demand (VOD) site. The pre-release promotional activities included online marketing and publicity of the film‚Äôs music videos, trailers, downloads, previews, preview shows, contests and continued with other promotional activities post-release like meet-and-greet events with the star cast at select cities. A unique promotional campaign was launched by producers Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani called \\"Auto By Chance\\". They introduced 10 \\"Auto by Chance\\" three- wheelers in suburban Mumbai suburbs that would transport people for free to the destination of their choice in the suburbs. The promotion was run in conjunction with Big FM radio station and Godrej. One passenger would be interviewed live by an RJ and go on air with his experience of getting lucky and enjoying the free ride. The Indian gaming portal Zapak.com created a microsite for the movie with a game, \\"Luck by Chance - Lucky Break\\". Release The movie was initially scheduled to be released 23 January 2009, alongside Raaz - The Mystery Continues, but was pushed to 30 January. Luck by Chance was released on 900 screens worldwide in 27 countries. Of this, over 700 screens were in India and the rest were in overseas markets such as the United States, Canada, UK, UAE, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. Reception =Critical reception= The film was well received by critics, Anupama Chopra of NDTV wrote, \\"Zoya pokes fun at Bollywood but she does it with a great affection. There are some lovely little moments like the star daughter in a super short skin-tight outfit struggling to touch her producer's feet without splitting a seam. But what makes Luck By Chance compelling is the layers beneath the laughs. Though the first half wobbles precariously as the script struggles to find a momentum, but thankfully the narrative flows better in the latter half and culminates in a satisfying, bittersweet end\\". In the review at UAE Daily the United Arab Emirates reviewer said, \\"One of the prime reasons why Luck By Chance works is because [of] the writing...Right from the characters, to the individualistic scenes, to the way Zoya puts them in a sequence, Luck By Chance is easily one of the most cohesive scripts this side of the Atlantic. If Zoya's writing is superb, her execution of the written material deserves distinction marks\\".Exclusive Movie Review: LUCK BY CHANCE , UAE Daily, retrieved on 2009-01-30 The Times of India said, \\"Luck By Chance highlights how the film industry give regards to everything else but the story when making a movie and ironically weaves a fascinating story using that paradox\\". Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL.in cited some drawbacks and said, \\"Luck By Chance provides you some smiles throughout the movie. However, it fails to leave you with the content smile that a feel-good movie ideally aims to do.\\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80%, based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.78/10. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said, \\"It might seem as if Bollywood couldn't possibly satirize itself ‚Äî the genre is already so over-the-top ‚Äî but Zoya Akhtar manages the trick deftly in Luck by Chance...A fabulous circus-theme musical number pulls out all the stops, but a scene in which an acting teacher explains why Hindi stars have to be more talented than those in Hollywood is a subtle comic gem\\"...[I]t is Mr. Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this far-ranging, cameo-filled film. He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc\\". Frank Lovece of Film Journal International characterized it as, \\"The Player meets All About Eve in this seriocomic satire of the Bollywood film industry by a first-time director whose collaring of over a dozen major Hindi stars for cameos speaks well of its biting accuracy\\", while Kyle Smith of the New York Post found it \\"gently humorous\\" and \\"almost totally lacking in the cynicism, self-hatred and ennui that characterizes inside-Hollywood flicks\\". =Box office performance= The movie had a slow start at the box office and registered 25% to 30% attendance. According to trade analyst and critic Joginder Tuteja, the occupancy at the theatres came down to 50%. Outside India, the movie performed per expectations. In the US, Luck by Chance debuted at number 32. In its opening weekend, it collected $217,439 (approximately Rs. 1.06 crores) on 61 screens, a per-screen average of $3,556.

Isabella Romola de' Medici (31 August 1542 ‚Äì 16 July 1576) was the daughter of Cosimo I de' Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Eleonora di Toledo. She was raised and educated in a humanist manner with her siblings, including Francesco de' Medici who succeeded their father as the Grand Duke of Tuscany. To secure a relationship with the powerful Roman Orsinis, Isabella's father arranged her marriage to Paolo Giordano I Orsini when she was 16. She remained in her father's household after her marriage, giving her an unusual degree of independence for a woman of her period. Following the death of her father, Isabella was probably murdered, with the complicity of her husband and brother, and in retribution for her relationship with Paolo Giordano's cousin Troilo Orsini. Biography Isabella de' Medici in her mid-20s, by Alessandro Allori, Uffizi, Florence. Isabella was born in Florence where, with her brothers and sisters, she lived first in the Palazzo Vecchio and later in the Palazzo Pitti, spending much of her time as a child at father's ancestral country home, Villa di Castello.Murphy, 24-28 The Medici children were educated at home by tutors in a range of subjects such as classics, languages, and arts. From an early age Isabella showed a great love for music, which in her adulthood she used as means for self-expression, according to biographer Caroline Murphy.Murphy, 40-44 A great beauty, she had a lively, high-spirited and impulsive character that was commented on by courtiers.One ambassador wrote about the teen-age Isabella: \\"Her liveliness never leaves her, it is born within her.\\" Murphy, 47 In 1553, at age 11 Isabella was betrothed to 12-year-old Paolo Giordano Orsini, in line for the Duchy of Bracciano in southern Tuscany, a liaison Isabella's father felt necessary to secure his southern border and his relationship with the ancient Roman Orsini family.Murphy, 54 The two married in 1558, in a semi-private ceremony, at Villa di Castello.Murphy, 54 Paolo left the following day. Concerned by the spending habits of his new son-in- law, Cosimo decided to keep his daughter and her 50,000 scudi dowry in Florence, giving her greater freedom and control over her own affairs than was customary for Florentine women of the time.Murphy, 67-68 Following her mother's death, she acted as first lady of Florence for a time, displaying the de' Medici aptitude for politics. She suffered several miscarriages and remained childless until her late twenties. Her daughter Francesca Eleonora (known as Nora), was born in 1571Langdon, 148 and eventually married her cousin Alessandro Sforza. Her son Virginio was born in 1572 and eventually inherited his father's dukedom. Isabella's free-spirited personality created rumours with regard to the nature of her relationship with Troilo Orsini, Paolo Giordano's cousin, who was charged with looking after her while her husband tended to military duties. On 16 July 1576 Isabella died unexpectedly at the Medici villa in Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday. According to her brother, the grandduke, this occurred \\"while she was washing her hair in the morning ... She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees, having immediately fallen dead.\\"Murphy 2008, 324 However, the official version of events was not generally believed, and the Ferrarese ambassador, Ercole Cortile, obtained information that Isabella was \\"strangled at midday\\" by her husband in the presence of several named servants.Murphy 2008, 324-325 Isabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family, her cousin Leonora, having died of a similar \\"accident\\" only a few days before.Murphy 2008, 316-324 Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed Isabella, in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with Troilo Orsini, or that he acted on instructions of the Grandduke Francesco, Isabella's brother.Murphy 2008, 328-333 One scholar, Elisabetta Mori, has argued that Isabella de' Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici.Mori Art Various paintings are extant, by Alessandro Allori (see above). Another painting with a right profile, also attributed to Allori, is owned by the Carnegie Museum of Art and has been uncovered and refurbished in 2014, having had a Victorian era face painted over.Faked, Forgotten, Found: The Restoration of Isabella de Medici, CMOA.org, Vimeo video 7m19s, 2014 Ancestry Notes References *Langdon, Gabrielle.

It is named after Edward \\"Ned\\" Eagle Brown. A section of the northeast quadrant of the forest preserve is the Busse Forest Nature Preserve, which was registered as a National Natural Landmark in February 1980. Busse Forest Preserve (Busse Woods) was named for Cook County Commissioner William Busse in 1949.Daily Herald, Arlington Heights, IL 7-15-1949, page 5http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-07-24/features/9407240381_1_mt- incorporation-forester Biology Busse Woods, the heart of the forest preserve, is a mature Great Lakes hardwood forest. A segment of the woods, the Busse Forest Nature Preserve, is listed as a national natural landmarkNPS NNL Summary page as a surviving fragment of flatwoods, a type of damp-ground forest formerly typical of extremely level patches of ground in the Great Lakes region. Parcels of land with slow rates of precipitation runoff into adjacent wetlands and streams were likely to develop into flatwoods. A flatwoods forest is characterized by red maple, swamp white oak, and black ash trees. The black ash trees of Busse Woods are threatened by the emerald ash borer, which was reported in Illinois for the first time in 2006. Other parts of Busse Woods are better-drained and include species more typical of the forests of northern Illinois, such as the basswood, hickory, sugar maple, and white oak, the latter species being the state tree of Illinois. Recreation There are of paved bicycle trail, the Busse Woods Trail, through the forest preserve: a loop and two spurs providing pedestrian and bicycle access to the preserve.The Busse Woods Trail map. In contrast to the natural area, the northwest and southwest quadrants of the preserve are dominated by Busse Lake, a artificial reservoir that serves as a flood-control catchment for Salt Creek and by the tall skyscrapers of eastern Schaumburg. Stewardship The Friends of Busse Woods, a non-governmental organization, began operations in 2008. It cooperates with the Forest Preserve District of Cook County to oversee stewardship partnering operations at Busse Woods. Partnership operations include invasive species management, trash removal, and native plant reseeding and restocking. The operations are carried out by volunteer stewards.

This module was planned to be used for a launch abort system pad- abort flight test. The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion MPCV) is a class of partially reusable spacecraft used in NASA's human spaceflight programs. Consisting two components ‚Äì a Crew Module (CM) manufactured by Lockheed Martin, and a European Service Module (ESM) manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space ‚Äì the spacecraft are designed to support crewed exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Orion is equipped with solar power, an automated docking system, and glass cockpit interfaces modeled after those used in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and can support a crew of six up to 21 days undocked and up to six months docked. A single AJ10 engine provides the spacecraft's primary propulsion, while eight R-4D-11 engines and six pods of custom reaction control system engines developed by Airbus provide the spacecraft's secondary propulsion. Although compatible with other launch vehicles, Orion is primarily designed to launch atop a Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, with a tower launch escape system. The earlier Apollo system had various abort modes depending on altitude, velocity, and other circumstances. Likewise the Orion will have similar modes of operation for its launch performance aborts. Some of these may not use the LAS itself, but would use the second stage of the SLS, or even the Orion vehicle's own propulsion system (the Aerojet AJ10 engine) instead. Initially designed to land on solid ground, like that of the early and current Soviet and Russian crewed spacecraft (Vostok, Voskhod, and Soyuz), with a water landing as a backup, in August 2007, NASA tentatively redesigned the Orion for water landings (splashdowns) as the primary mode of landing, with ground landings as the emergency backup. Under the advice of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) report, NASA will most likely develop abort procedures that resemble the abort procedures used on Apollo, but with some procedures carried over from the Shuttle.  Modes  The method of abort, either using the LAS or the second stage of the Space Launch System booster, depends on how far into the flight the spacecraft and crew are traveling. =Prelaunch= NASA has acquired several MRAPs to station near the launch pad, should there be time for the crew to evacuate the vehicle. One will be occupied by emergency rescue personnel, while the other will stand empty behind a blast shelter.MRAP Rolls Through Pad Evacuation Runs Pad emergency egress enables astronauts and engineers to quickly escape the perimeter of the rocket. Both zip-lines and roller coasters were at one time studied for this purpose.nasaspaceflight.com, September 2012 = Mode one = During the first 120 seconds of flight, up to the jettisoning of the solid- fueled boosters at , the Orion crew module (CM) will separate from the rest of the rocket propelled by the LAS. Unlike the Apollo Launch Escape System, which used a pair of canards and the weight of the spacecraft to flip the vehicle over for landing, the Orion LAS has a set of steering rockets that will steer the spacecraft away from the malfunctioning SLS, as well as prepare the spacecraft for both separation and splashdown. The tower will then be jettisoned 14 seconds later and the hypergolic fuel on the Orion CM would be automatically released at a pre-determined altitude. = Mode two = After the LAS is jettisoned, the Orion will separate as a whole from the SLS and either use its large AJ-10 engine or smaller control engines to maneuver from the rocket. Similar to a Space Shuttle trans-Atlantic (TAL) abort profile, the Orion will use the AJ-10 engine to propel the spacecraft to a desired separation point, in which then the Orion CM would land in either western Spain or Morocco on \\"due east\\" (i.e., lunar) flights, or in Ireland or the United Kingdom on ISS-bound flights. A splashdown in the eastern Atlantic Ocean would only be a contingency. = Mode three = The SLS would propel the Orion into an initial orbit, upon which the spacecraft will immediately separate, and then perform a retrofire that will allow the Orion CM to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the U.S. West Coast, or make a ground landing at either Edwards Air Force Base in California or White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. This is similar in profile to the Shuttle's abort once around (AOA) profile. = Mode four = If the SLS suffers less-than-ideal performance during the initial orbit insertion, it can be restarted 45 minutes later to place the Orion into a less than ideal orbit that can be corrected with the on-board propellant reserves later in the flight. This is similar to the Shuttle's Abort To Orbit (ATO) profile, but depending upon the stable orbit reached, it may require NASA to end the mission with a landing at either Edwards or White Sands within a 24-hour period.

Location The legend of the Hairy Hands is set in Postbridge, Dartmoor. The road is now known as the B3212. According to the story surrounding them, the Hairy Hands are a pair of disembodied hands that appear suddenly, grab at the steering wheel of a moving car or the handlebars of a motorcycle, and then force the victim off the road. In some cases the hands are described as being invisible. Incidents The bleakness of Dartmoor has encouraged the growth of many legends. Since around 1910, drivers and cyclists have reported suffering unusual accidents along the road between Postbridge and Two Bridges. In many cases, the victims reported that their vehicle had jolted or swerved violently and steered off the side of the road, as if something had taken hold of the wheels and wrenched it out of their control. In most instances, the victims ran into a verge and survived. Their experiences remained a local curiosity, until June 1921, when Dr. E.H. Helby, the medical officer for Dartmoor Prison, was killed when he lost control of his motorcycle combination. Two young girls, children of the prison governor, who had been riding in the sidecar, survived. Several weeks after Dr Helby's death, there was another incident in which a coach driver lost control, injuring several passengers who were thrown out of their seats. Then, on 26 August 1921, an army Captain reported that a pair of invisible hands had taken hold of him and forced his motorcycle off the road, after which the story was picked up by newspapers in London and the story became known nationwide. In Supernatural Dartmoor by Michael Williams, there is a story told by journalist and author Rufus Endle. He claimed that, while driving near Postbridge on an unstated date, \\"a pair of hands gripped the driving wheel and I had to fight for control.\\" He managed to avoid a crash and the hands disappeared as inexplicably as they had come. He requested that Williams not publish the story until after his death, for fear of ridicule. Not all reported incidents occurred in moving vehicles. In one incident, in 1924, a woman camping on the moor with her husband reported seeing a hairy hand attempting to gain access to her caravan during the night. She reported that the hand retreated after she made the sign of the Cross. Explanations Most variations of the legend of the Hairy Hands do not specify the origins of the hands or attribute to them any specific purpose, other than driving motorists off the road. A few local versions of the story attribute the hands to an unnamed man who died in an accident on the road. According to local sceptics, most of the accidents were caused by people who were unfamiliar with the area driving too fast down narrow country roads with high walled sides (spurious as the B3212 is not a narrow country road and has no high walled sides, although excessive speed may be a factor), resulting in them either losing control or misjudging the road and running off its edges. After the story appeared in the national press, several investigations were carried out into the road. It was eventually determined that the accidents were most likely due to the camber of the road's surface, which reached dangerous levels in places and was duly altered. In the media The legend was linked to witchcraft in the short play 'The Hairy Hand of Dartmoor' by Michael McStay, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 8 February 1999. The Hairy Hands were mentioned (and incorrectly ascribed to the B3021) by Josh Widdicombe on \\"Monster Mash\\", an episode in Series M of panel show QI.\\"QI Series M, Episode 13 - Monster Mash, comedy.co.uk.

Recorded during the middle of 1977, It Begins Again was her first completed and released album since Cameo five years earlier. Two of the album's titles, \\"Turn Me Around\\" and \\"A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Every Day)\\", were tracks from the abandoned 1974 Longing sessions and Springfield decided to record new versions of both songs for It Begins Again, placing Chi Coltrane's \\"Turn Me Around\\" as the opening track.  Background  It Begins Again, which was Springfield's debut album for the United Artists label in the US and Mercury Records in the UK, was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Englishman Roy Thomas Baker, at the time best known for helping create the four first albums by Queen. Musically It Begins Again was however geared towards the American adult contemporary, pop and disco markets. Contributing on the album were some of the most renowned American session musicians of the era, such as Jay Graydon, Jeff Baxter, Joe Sample, Ed Greene and David Paich and it featured backing vocals by Pattie Brooks, Dianne Brooks and Brenda Russell ‚Äì all acclaimed recording artists and composers in their own right. The songs on the album were also written by a number of notable composers and lyricists, among others Nona Hendryx, Lesley Gore, Ellen Weston, Dean Parks, Peter Allen and Carole Bayer Sager. Barry Manilow's \\"Sandra\\", often singled out as the highlight of the set, is a gentle piano ballad that portrays the life of a suburban housewife who minutely details her daily chores, all the while assuring both herself and the listener that \\"I swear I love my husband and I swear I love my kids\\" ‚Äì yet in the last verse she reveals that she one day found herself cutting her wrists \\"doing the dishes, quite by mistake. It was real touch and go for a while.\\" Containing a diverse range of styles, It Begins Again was seen as somewhat experimental by Springfield herself, as well as music critics, who generally gave it favourable reviews. Despite the critical reception, the hopeful album title, as well as a series of promotional performances made in both the US and the UK promoting the up-tempo singles \\"A Love Like Yours\\" and \\"That's the Kind of Love I've Got for You\\", It Begins Again only briefly made the charts in Britain, peaking at No. 41, and did not chart in the US. Springfield stated that she had wanted to try something different, but felt that she now needed to move into a different style, a commercial, lightweight R&B;, which resulted in the following album Living Without Your Love. In 2002, Mercury/Universal Music UK released the album on CD for the first time, then also including Tom Moulton's extended remix of \\"That's the Kind of Love I've Got for You\\", originally only released as a promotional 12\\" single, which took advantage of the popularity of disco at the time. The song which was the closing track on It Begins Again was, however, the only true disco song on the album. The 12\\" version was somewhat popular with US deejays and the track in fact managed to reach No. 31 in the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. When the Pet Shop Boys in 2005 released their instalment in the mix album series Back to Mine they both included a Dusty Springfield track, Neil Tennant chose her 60s classic \\"Goin' Back\\" ‚Äì and Chris Lowe rather surprisingly the ballad \\"I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love\\" from It Begins Again.

Superseding the Auto Union 1000, it was the last model branded as a DKW by the manufacturer and also the last West German production car equipped with a two-stroke engine. Specifications DKW F 102, museum mobile, Ingolstadt The last European built Auto Union 1000 and 1000S models were produced in July 1963 and the DKW F102 was presented as a replacement model in September 1963, although volume production of 2-door F102s began only in March 1964 with four door cars joining them on the production line in January 1965.Werner Oswald: Deutsche Autos 1945‚Äì1990, vol. 4, , p. 421 It was the last model developed before the Volkswagen take-over. Under Volkswagen control, the F102 provided the basis for the later Audi F103 models (the \\"Audi\\" and later \\"Audi 72\\", plus 60, 75, 80, and Super 90). The F102 featured state-of-the-art two-stroke technology for its time and a unibody of modern design. Nevertheless, the market of the 1960s shunned two- stroke engines as old-fashioned. The F102 in consequence sold below the company's expectations and was the source of huge financial losses. Due to this situation Volkswagen was forced to implement a radical change in 1965. The production of two-stroke-engines was ended, with the last F102s produced in March 1966, by when 52,753 or 53,053 had been produced.Sources differ. The F102 was redesigned to accommodate a four-cylinder-four-stroke-engine. At this point the name of DKW was abandoned, and the F102 mutated into the Audi F103, the first new Audi model since 1938.

Classified as metal carbonyl cluster, it is a dark orange-colored solid that is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. The compound serves as a precursor to other organoruthenium compounds. Structure and synthesis The cluster has D3h symmetry, consisting of an equilateral triangle of Ru atoms, each of which bears two axial and two equatorial CO ligands.Slebodnick, C.; Zhao, J.; Angel, R.; Hanson, B. E.; Song, Y.; Liu, Z.; Hemley, R. J., \\"High Pressure Study of Ru3(CO)12 by X-ray Diffraction, Raman, and Infrared Spectroscopy\\", Inorg. Chem., 2004, vol. 43, 5245-52. Os3(CO)12 has the same structure, whereas Fe3(CO)12 is different, with two bridging CO ligands, resulting in C2v symmetry. Ru3(CO)12 is prepared by treating solutions of ruthenium trichloride with carbon monoxide, usually under high pressure.M. Faure, C. Saccavini, G. Lavigne \\"Dodecacarbonyltriruthenium, Ru3(CO)12\\" Inorganic Syntheses, 2004 Vol 34, p. 110. The stoichiometry of the reaction is uncertain, one possibility being the following: :6 RuCl3 \\\\+ 33 CO + 18 CH3OH ‚Üí 2 Ru3(CO)12 \\\\+ 9 CO(OCH3)2 \\\\+ 18 HCl Reactions The chemical properties of Ru3(CO)12 have been widely studied, and the cluster has been converted to hundreds of derivatives. High pressures of CO convert the cluster to the monomeric ruthenium pentacarbonyl, which reverts to the parent cluster upon standing. :Ru3(CO)12 \\\\+ 3 CO 3 Ru(CO)5 Keq = 3.3 x 10‚àí7 mol dm‚àí3 at room temperature The instability of Ru(CO)5 contrasts with the robustness of the corresponding Fe(CO)5. The condensation of Ru(CO)5 into Ru3(CO)12 proceeds via initial, rate-limiting loss of CO to give the unstable, coordinatively unsaturated species Ru(CO)4. This tetracarbonyl binds Ru(CO)5, initiating the condensation.Hastings, W. R.; Roussel, M. R.; Baird, M. C. \\"Mechanism of the conversion of [Ru(CO)5] into [Ru3(CO)12]\\" Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions, 1990, pages 203-205. Upon warming under a pressure of hydrogen, Ru3(CO)12 converts to the tetrahedral cluster H4Ru4(CO)12.Bruce, M. I.; Williams, M.

She served as the director of the National Museum of Costa Rica and endowed numerous professorial chairs in U.S. universities. Born 1909 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Doris Zemurray was the daughter of Samuel Zemurray, aka Sam the Banana man, a Jewish immigrant who founded the Cuyamel Fruit Company the following year. He built the company into a successful venture, later famously selling it to the United Fruit Company giant in 1930 only to subsequently engineer a reverse takeover of sorts, serving as the latter's director in a profitable, if controversial, tenure from 1933 to 1952.Union College Office of Communications (1995) In 1917 Zemurray purchased and moved his family into a three-storey Beaux Arts mansion on St. Charles Avenue facing Tulane University, which would become the family home for the next four decades. In the early 1960s the mansion was transferred to Tulane where it became the residency of the University's presidents.Johnson (2007) Doris Zemurray attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she majored in anthropology, and also pursued graduate studies in archaeology.Ogilvie & Harvey (2000, p.1241) She graduated in 1930.

Biography Born in Eluisenstein, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire (now Latvia), Thiess grew up in Berlin. He worked as a journalist for four years until he was enlisted into the Germany army in World War I. Discharged after a few months because of a heart condition, he returned to Berlin and journalism. Within a few years, however. he decided to devote himself full- time to writing. His early novels were focussed on contemporary subjects -- Time magazine once called him \\"the hot trumpet in Germany's jazz age.\\" He married Florence Losey, an American singer. From the 1930s on, he concentrated on historical novels. His 1936 novel, Tsushima, translated into English as The Voyage of Forgotten Men, recounted the epic journey of the Russian Second Pacific Squadron, under the command of Admiral Rozhestvensky, from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan, and its defeat by the Japanese fleet at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. His two-part novel, Neapolitanische Legende and Caruso in Sorrent, was based on the life and career of the great Italian tenor, Enrico Caruso. Thiess remained in Nazi Germany, but there is no evidence that he joined the Nazi Party. Thiess died 1977 in Darmstadt.

These drugs cause an autoimmune response (the body attacks its own cells) producing symptoms similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There are 38 known medications to cause DIL but there are three that report the highest number of cases: hydralazine, procainamide, and quinidine. While the criteria for diagnosing DIL has not been thoroughly established, symptoms of DIL typically present as muscle pain and joint pain. Generally, the symptoms recede after discontinuing use of the drugs.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus include the following: * Joint pain (arthralgia) and muscle pain (myalgia) * Fatigue * Serositis‚Äîinflammation of the tissues lining the heart and lungs. * Anti- histone antibodies in 95% of cases among those taking procainamide, hydralazine, chlorpromazine, and quinidine; however, these antibodies have been found in a smaller proportion of patients associated with other medications, including minocycline, propylthiouracil, and statins. These signs and symptoms are not side effects of the drugs taken which occur during short term use. DIL occurs over long-term and chronic use of the medications listed below. While these symptoms are similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus, they are generally not as severe unless they are ignored which leads to more harsh symptoms, and in some reported cases, death.  Causes  The processes that lead to drug-induced lupus erythematosus are not entirely understood. The exact processes that occur are not known even after 50 years since its discovery, but many studies present theories on the mechanisms of DIL. A predisposing factor to developing DIL is N-acetylation speed, or the rate at which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells, creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL. Of the drugs that cause DIL, hydralazine has been found to cause a higher incidence. Hydralazine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure. Approximately 5% of the patients who have taken hydralazine over long periods of time and in high doses have shown DIL-like symptoms.Schur, Peter H. et al. (1983), p. 223. Many of the other drugs have a low to very low risk to develop DIL. The following table shows the risk of development of DIL of some of these drugs on a high to very low scale. * High risk: ** Procainamide (antiarrhythmic) ** Hydralazine (antihypertensive) * Moderate risk: ** Quinidine (antiarrhythmic) * Low to Very Low Risk: ** Infliximab anti (TNF-Œ±) ** Etanercept anti (TNF-Œ±) ** Isoniazid (antibiotic) ** Minocycline (antibiotic) ** Pyrazinamide (antibiotic) ** D-Penicillamine (anti-inflammatory) ** Carbamazepine (anticonvulsant) ** Oxcarbazepine (anticonvulsant) ** Phenytoin (anticonvulsant) ** Propafenone (antiarrhythmic) ** Chlorpromazine (antipsychotic) ** Minoxidil (antihypertensive vasodilator) Diagnosis Antinuclear antibodies are usually positive in drug-induced Lupus. Anti- Neutrophil Cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) can also be positive in association with certain drugs. Furthermore, Anti-Histone antibodies can also be positive in drug-induced lupus. Anti-Histone antibodies are positive in up to 95% of patients with drug induced lupus. The most common medications associated with drug induced lupus are hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, methyldopa, chlorpromazine, quinidine, and minocycline.  Treatment  It is important to recognize early that these drugs are causing DIL like symptoms and discontinue use of the drug. Symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus generally disappear days to weeks after medication use is discontinued. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will quicken the healing process. Corticosteroids may be used if more severe symptoms of DIL are present.

It was published by Faber and Faber on 19 October 2006. It consists of 19 sonnets, each named for a battle beginning with the letter B. Its name stems from the areas north and south of the equator in which sailing ships tend to be becalmed, and where sailors traditionally (and possibly apocryphally) threw horses overboard, to lighten the ship and conserve food supplies (see Horse latitudes). The title was previously employed by Doors singer Jim Morrison for a song on the Strange Days album. Like many of Muldoon's recent collections, Horse Latitudes contains a long poem ‚Äì in this case a sonnet sequence ostensibly describing battle scenes through time and place. The collection also features several other characteristic features of Muldoon's work, such as fixed poetic forms and deft technique combined with a seemingly casual approach full of puns, slant-rhymes and wordplay. The collection is based on serious themes and emotions. Muldoon has reportedly said that the battle of Baghdad \\"is implied by omission\\", consistent with the themes of evasion, silence and censorship. This collection contains the poem \\"Sillyhow Stride\\", written in memory of Warren Zevon. Critical reception In his review of Horse Latitudes, James Fenton of The Guardian described the work as \\"disconcerting\\", and praised Muldoon for the \\"brilliance of his verbal transformations\\". Jim McCue of The Independent described Muldoon as \\"a good poet in the doldrums\\", saying that after 48 trips to the dictionary he felt \\"the book's erudition is for show, and wordplay stands in for meaning instead of standing up for it\\". The New York Times noted the clever and obscure references which Muldoon used to convey the anger and sadness in his poetry, and said \\"the poem's weird levity only darkens the tone\\". The review of Robert Potts in The Telegraph echoed this, saying the \\"ludic nature\\" of Muldoon's work \\"has occasionally irritated less patient readers\\" but that his \\"fun does not preclude his seriousness\\". Potts also praises Muldoon for his \\"absolute control of pitch and tone, his slinky rhythms and winking jests\\". The Irish incarnation of The Independent said understanding Muldoon \\"is often about as easy as to imagine Finnegans Wake outselling the Farmers Journal\\", but added \\"however much the subject-line veers, in the end it comes home, surprisingly enough, to simplicity and clarity\\". Reviewer Brian Lynch mentioned the intensely personal subject matter of his family's cancer history and the juxtaposition between this and the battles through history. He concluded \\"Muldoon more often than not manages by dint of skill to bring the private and public momentarily into balance, to achieve the calm associated with the oceanic standstill found at the latitudes of the title\\".

The book's contents were originally published as the comic book Eightball #22 and were subsequently reformatted to make the hardcover Ice Haven book. Ice Haven takes the form of 29 short, stylistically diverse comic strips about different residents of the small town of Ice Haven. Although each strip is separately titled and presented as if it is self-contained, together they tell a story about the characters' interrelated lives. The uniting plot line of the book involves the kidnapping of a boy named David Goldberg. Characters Random Wilder ‚Äì The supposedly humble narrator of the story who's neither humble nor much of a narrator. He's mainly concerned with his own problems. Wilder is an aspiring writer who nurses a bitter rivalry with Ice Haven's current poet laureate, Ida Wentz. He lives alone and looks down on the general public. Vida ‚Äì Described as an \\"out-of-town guest\\", Vida is a struggling writer who is visiting her grandmother, Ida Wentz. She writes a magazine which doesn't sell. After reading some of Random Wilder's poems, she becomes obsessed with the neighbor who she describes as an \\"owlish oddity\\", and begins to follow him around. David Goldberg ‚Äì The silent boy who is kidnapped during the course of the story. Charles ‚Äì A quiet boy who only talks at length and intelligently to his young neighbor, George. He's disturbed by the behavior he observes from Carmichael, with whom he goes to school. Secretly, Charles is madly in love with his stepsister, Violet, and wishes to end the marriage of their parents in order for them to be together at a later date. Carmichael ‚Äì A \\"troubled youth.\\" He speaks mainly to Charles, though the two are not exactly friends. After he loans Charles a book about the Leopold and Loeb murder (the contents of which are summarized in a one-page comic strip), Charles suspects he might be involved in David Goldberg's disappearance. Violet ‚Äì A teenager in her senior year of high school. She's romantically involved with a boy named Penrod and often daydreams about him. She is unhappy at home with her mother and stepfather, is teased at school, and appears to be friendly only with a girl named Julie. Harry Naybors ‚Äì A serious comic book enthusiast and critic. He is the first character to be introduced after David Goldberg. Harry is the only character to break the fourth wall and speak directly to the reader. Mr. Ames ‚Äì A private investigator who comes to Ice Haven to look into the disappearance of David Goldberg. He has angry outbursts but is otherwise emotionally unreadable. He cares deeply for both his wife and his work. Mrs. Ames ‚Äì Mr. Ames's wife, who is investigating the case alongside her husband. She is growing increasingly fed up with him and their marriage. It is implied that she pursues multiple extramarital affairs while in Ice Haven. Ida Wentz ‚Äì Vida's kindly and emotional grandmother. Poet laureate of Ice Haven. Julie Rathman ‚Äì An overweight friend of Violet's who works at a stationery store and is generally miserable. Kim Lee ‚Äì A convenience store worker who is uncommunicative with customers. Paula ‚Äì A young girl that goes to school with Charles and Carmichael. She is taking ballet and is revealed to have a particularly gloomy outlook. George ‚Äì Charles's young neighbor in whom he confides. George rarely speaks and is never seen without his toy, Blue Bunny. Blue Bunny ‚Äì George's stuffed animal. In a short comic, Blue Bunny is shown in his anthropomorphic form, where he is revealed to be psychotic. Penrod ‚Äì Violet's love interest. He doesn't return Violet's affection at all. Rocky ‚Äì A caveman mainly concerned with survival, procreation, and other aspects of living in the year 100,000 B.C. He apparently was the first man to arrive at the location of modern-day Ice Haven. Officer Kaufman ‚Äì A police officer that appears on and off throughout the book. Guilford High School incident The comic generated controversy when Nate Fisher, a high school teacher in Guilford, Connecticut gave Eightball #22 (Ice Haven) to a student as a make-up summer reading assignment. The parents of the student had concerns about the book's appropriateness. The superintendent of Guilford High School said the book was inappropriate for 13-year-olds and placed the teacher on leave.

He was the grandson of Rayees-ul-Waqt Hajji Mukhthar Shah Ashai. The 'Ashai Bagh Bridge' over Nigeen Lake and Dal Lake is named after Ashai's ancestors. Before moving to suburban Srinagar, the Ashais lived at the 'Ashai Kocha' in Fateh Kadal, Srinagar. The historic Ashai mansion now hosts a Girl's high school. Ashai's hut in Raj Bagh has been converted into a hotel. Popularly known as Ashai Sahib by his colleagues, political contemporaries and subordinates, Ghulam Ahmad Ashai was the first Kashmiri Muslim to attain a bachelor's degree. In reward for his service and academic achievements, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah appointed Ghulam Ahmad Ashai as the first Registrar of the University of Kashmir, both for academic and administrative matters, from 1948 to 1953. He led the first convocation of the University of Kashmir at Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir) Park and was followed by a distinguished panel including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pro-Indian Sheikh Abdullah. Ashai's involvement with Kashmir University started when he was appointed as the Special Officer assigned with the responsibility of starting Kashmir's first university. Ashai spent the next two years touring universities across India building up strategic ties and relations with renowned and established universities. 1951 ‚Äì The First Convocation Procession of the University of Jammu & Kashmir Led by Late Ashai sahib, the Registrar. He is followed by the Vice Chancellor, Wazir Janki Nath (Chief Justice), Sheikh Abdullah (Prime Minister of J&K;), Pandit Nehru (Prime Minister of India), C. Rajagopalachari (the Governor General of India) and Karan Singh (the Yuvraj at the time).In the 1980 Sheikh Abdullah's National Conference government, in recognition of Ashai‚Äôs contributions as founding registrar designated the main road leading to the present university campus in Hazratbal as Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road. A commemorative plaque was installed at the entrance of the university, but it has since been removed. The family claims that illegal orders were given to have the plaque removed and the road christening annulled. However, according to official papers, the road is still legally named as \\"Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road\\". Education Ashai secured first class in the B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) examination of the Punjab University with the distinction of topping the list of candidates in 1915. He then gained his M.A. (Master of Arts) in Persian from Calcutta University. He obtained first division and was awarded His Excellency the Chancellor‚Äôs Gold Medal and the highest cash prize of Rs.200. He gained his B.T. (Bachelor of Teaching) from the Punjab University. He also passed the Munshi Fazil Examination from the same university which earned him an additional degree of M.O.L. (Master of Oriental Languages). He successfully competed for the Senior Forest Service of the State of Jammu and Kashmir with distinction but opted out of it. Family Ghulam Ahmad Ashai was married to Jana Begum, the only daughter of Khwaja Amir Shah of Varmul, a wealthy Kashmiri nobleman. Ahmad and Jana had ten children; four sons and six daughters. They lost their second daughter to a viral disease at age 7. Ashai‚Äôs children founded a charitable memorial trust at Kashmir in memory of their father on 26 August 2005.

The mall is within one mile of three bordering cities on the southern end of San Bernardino (Redlands, Colton, and Loma Linda). Inland Center is a single-level mall anchored by, JCPenney, Forever 21 and Macy's, plus 110 specialty shops and services. History =Construction and grand opening= Originally constructed by Homart Development Company and opened in 1966, Inland Center Mall was built on top of the former Urbita Springs lake. Three major department stores anchored the mall at or close to its opening date: *The Broadway opened August 29, 1966, 3 selling floors, . Charles Luckman and Associates, architects. Its exterior was featured white pillars, as well as Portuguese marble in brown and champagne tones. It had interior murals by Charles Riggs, Ben Morris, Roy Little, Paul Sherman, and Ray Jacobs. *May Company opened September 6, 1966, three levels, *Sears opened September 28, 1966, 2 levels, plus an automotive center in an outbuilding The mall courcourse with approximately 70 stores, opened October 12, 1966. There was parking for 5,000 cars. The total lots size was . =1990s= The mall experienced a number of changes in the 1990s. In 1993, the May Company store closed leaving the mall with only two anchors, The Broadway and Sears, which reduced overall traffic after merging with May Department Stores. In 1995, Gottschalks moved into the old May Co building. A year later, Macy's bought out The Broadway, and converted its three-story building to a Macy's location. In 1998, a fourth anchor building was annexed in front of the mall's main entrance, along with a four-story parking structure. The store was Robinsons-May, returning to the mall after a five- year hiatus from doing business in San Bernardino since May Co's closure. =2000s= In 2000, the main entrances were renovated placing trees and benches at all entrances and a new mall sign along with a new remodeled Food Court next to Sears, where the old Miller's Outpost was located. In 2006, Macy's bought out Robinsons-May, and since having two anchors on the same property was redundant, decided to close the old Broadway building in favor of the more modern built Robinsons-May building at its current location. The vacant Broadway building was sold to Mervyn's in 2007 for renovation and a proposed opening in September 2008, but the Mervyn‚Äôs company was liquidated around that time after filing for Chapter 7. Also in October 2008, construction was made to seal off the vacant and smaller second level of the mall to public traffic. In 2009, Forever 21 announced it would move into the vacant building that was partially renovated by Mervyn's. Gottschalks closed its doors in July 2009 after they too filed for Chapter 11 liquidation. J. C. Penney announced that they would open at the former Gottschalks building. =2010s= In 2013, Macerich Corporation installed over 4,000 solar panels on the corridor rooftops to reduce their dependence on electricity during operating hours. EV Charging Stations were also installed in the parking lots at the major entrances. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Inland Center, into Seritage Growth Properties. In 2016, JCPenney opened a store in the former Gottschalks building. In summer 2018, it was announced that fashion retailer H&M; would be opening a 20,000 square foot location inside the mall. The store opened later in fall 2018. https://www.pe.com/2018/01/30/hm-is-coming-to-san-bernardinos- inland-center/ On October 1, 2019, it was announced that Forever 21 would be closing as part of a plan to close 178 stores nationwide. However, there have been conflicting reports of this location closing, and as of June 2020, the store has remained open.https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/01/heres-a-map-of- the-forever-21-stores-set-to-close.html On November 7, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide. The store closed on February 2, 2020. =2020s= On June 4, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would be closing as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide. However as of August 2020, this store has been removed from the closing list and will stay open for now.https://www.pe.com/2020/06/04/jc- penney-to-close-154-stores-including-chino-san-bernardino/ Structural features In 2006, the original Macy's store which occupied a dated The Broadway location was closed and the more modern Robinsons-May was converted to Macy's as part of the Federated Department Stores merger with May Department Stores. Mervyn's was to take over the old anchor space but failed to open after their bankruptcy finalized in 2009. Construction was also completed in 2007 to seal off the lower level, demolishing a staircase and glass elevator that took customers to the lower level of the mall that remained vacant after Oshman's Sporting Goods and a video arcade closed down in prior decades. After construction was completed, the upper level floor was made solid and a Children's Play Area themed after US Route 66 was built near the old staircase location. On January 2008, parking lots adjacent to the parking structure and a small portion of the underutilized western parking areas of the mall were used in the recent SANBAG and Caltrans I-215 expansion project. The Inland Center Drive overpass reopened next to the mall in April 2010. During 2009, two adjacent pads to Inland Center owned by Macerich corporation were razed and placed for sale: On North Mall Boulevard and E Street (Formerly a Citibank branch) and South Mall Boulevard and E Street (Formerly Buffalo Ranch Restaurant). =Mall layout= A distinctive feature of Inland Center is the large cement vault in the center of the mall serving as its main entrance prior to 1988. The vault today serves as the walkway between Macy's and Forever 21 with smaller-format stores along each side and a perpendicular main walkway with full-size inline stores crossing the vault to reach JCPenney and the former Sears.

Gleason (November 12, 1858 ‚Äì July 21, 1932) was a shortstop in Major League Baseball who played from through for three different teams of the American Association. Listed at , 170 lb., Gleason batted and threw right- handed. His older brother, Jack Gleason, was also a ballplayer. Early life A St. Louis native, Gleason played amateur baseball for the St. Louis Stocks as early as age 16. He earned the nickname \\"Brudder Bill\\" because he was teammates with his older sibling, Jack Gleason, on several amateur and professional baseball teams. Major league career Gleason entered the majors in 1882 with the St. Louis Browns, where he and Jack Gleason were the first siblings to play in the same major league infield. His most productive season came in 1887, when he posted career numbers in batting average (.288), runs (135), hits (172), and on-base percentage (.342). A member of three St. Louis champion teams from 1885 to 1887, in 1883 and 1885 he led the league in games played. During his time with the St. Louis Browns, Gleason was roommates with Charlie Comiskey. While Gleason was considered a gentleman off the field, he was loud and aggressive on the baseball diamond, often hurling continuous insults at opposing players or using his spikes on the basepaths to break up double plays. An 1885 Sporting Life article suggested that if Gleason broke a limb or his neck, \\"not a ball player in the American Association would feel the slightest regret.\\" After Gleason played for the Browns for six years, he joined the Philadelphia Athletics (1888) and Louisville Colonels (1889). In an eight-season career, Gleason was a .267 hitter (907-for-3395) with seven home runs and 298 RBI in 798 games, including 613 runs, 111 doubles, and 35 triples. Incomplete data shows him stealing 70 bases and getting hit by 52 pitches. Gleason became an AA umpire in 1891, but his tenure lasted only one game. In Gleason's lone appearance, a game between the St. Louis Browns and Cincinnati Reds, King Kelly was the catcher and team captain of the Reds. With a tie game in the ninth inning, and with darkness setting in, Kelly told his Reds teammates to stall time. Gleason awarded a forfeit to St. Louis; the league fired him for the decision and the game was played again. Later life Gleason was a member of the St. Louis Fire Department during and after his baseball career. Late in his life, he was a captain with Engine Co. No. 28. In the summer of 1932, Gleason stepped on a nail at a fire, resulting in a foot infection. While recovering from that infection, Gleason tried to walk to a local drug store. He collapsed from heat exhaustion and was confined to bed for a few days before he died in his St. Louis home on July 21, 1932.

In 2006 the science journal Nature listed it as the top-ranked blog written by a scientist based on popularity. The blog addresses a range of topics, including Myers's academic specialty, biology. It has become particularly well known for Myers's writing style (characterized by sarcasm) and for his criticism of intelligent design and creationism. In 2009, Hemant Mehta ranked Pharyngula the most popular atheist blog, based on subscriber levels and other factors. History According to Alexa Internet, Pharyngula.org was started on June 19, 2002.Alexa Internet, Related info for pharyngula.org; accessed 3 September 2006. It started out as an experiment in writing instruction for a class. Students were required to submit mini-essays to be published online. After the project was finished, Myers still had the web-publishing software, and started to use it personally. The blog is named after his favourite stage in embryonic development, the pharyngula stage. Pharyngula moved to hosting at ScienceBlogs in 2005. In 2007, Myers reviewed Stuart Pivar's book Lifecode, which argues that self-organization at the embryonic and fetal stages determines the development and final structure of organisms. Myers reviewed the book negatively, stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivar's imagination and had no basis in actual evidence. After some discussion in the comments threads of Pharyngula, Pivar sued Myers for libel. Within a week Pivar withdrew the lawsuit, stating that \\"the real issue got sidelined\\" and that his problem was more with Seed Media Group. In June 2008, Myers commented on national press reports that a University of Central Florida student took a host (Eucharist wafer) from a Catholic Mass in response to forcible attempts to stop him from carrying it back to his seat, where he claimed he planned to show it to a fellow student who was curious about the Catholic faith.Communion wafer held 'hostage' raises holy heck, Star Tribune, Jul 11, 2008. After death threats were directed against the student by some who were offended by the student's behavior, Myers composed his first blog post on the topic. After describing the harassment leveled against the student, he asked readers to acquire for him consecrated Eucharistic hosts, which he might \\"show you sacrilege, gladly, and with much fanfare\\" and could treat \\"with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web.\\" Bill Donohue's Catholic League responded with a letter demanding the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature take action against Myers. Proponents of this action noted that Myers's blog could be reached from his university web page. Myers has received several death threats and much hate mail over the controversy. In August 2011, Myers and others founded a new blog network, FreethoughtBlogs, to host Pharyngula and other blogs in the atheist/secular field.Freethoughtblogs: The official announcement According to Myers, the move was made as an \\"acceptable compromise\\" between him and National Geographic, who at that time would be \\"taking a more active role in hosting the ScienceBlogs stable\\" and therefore \\"bringing their standards & practices, which are different from the more freewheeling policies of Seed Media [and would cause] a culture clash\\". Myers stated that \\"NatGeo and I have worked out an acceptable compromise. This site on Freethoughtblogs [‚Ä¶is not] in any way associated with National Geographic\\" and that he would only cross-post to his original site on ScienceBlogs \\"whatever I write that I feel is compatible with the more conservative ethos of National Geographic.\\"Inaugural Pharyngula post on Freethoughtblogs As such, since August 2011, the complete Pharyngula has appeared on FreethoughtBlogs, and a limited selection of those posts ‚Äì the more science-focused ones ‚Äì are cross-posted to the ScienceBlogs-hosted version. In September 2012, Myers announced that blogger and environmentalist Chris Clarke would become Pharyngula's co-author. Clarke left the blog in August 2013, partly because of the perceived unpleasantness of Pharyngula commenters Content Myers often criticizes intelligent design, creationism and pseudoscientific movements, and posts on subjects such as science, religion, politics, superstition, and education. His experience in evolutionary developmental biology and as a teacher provides depth to the subjects of science and education. One theme that arises regularly is that of cephalopods, creatures that Myers finds quite fascinating. =Creationism= In particular Myers frequently offers specific criticisms of creationism, including intelligent design as well as the Discovery Institute, Answers in Genesis, and other groups that promote pseudoscientific ideas. For example, in February and March 2007, he focused many of his posts on creationist neurosurgeon Michael Egnor, who had recently joined the Discovery Institute. In addition to Myers's criticisms of Egnor's arguments on evolution and Intelligent Design, Myers criticized the Discovery Institute's reliance on someone whose expertise wasn't relevant to evolution.Dr Michael Egnor challenges evolution! , Pharyngula, 2007-01-18. In early April 2007, Myers participated in an April Fool's Day joke arranged by The Panda's Thumb which manufactured a website spoofing the Discovery Institute's page on which \\"Egnor\\" admitted that his association with the Discovery Institute was itself an April Fool's joke. This elaborate prank succeeded in fooling many of his readers, while others succeeded in spotting jokes in the design of the false Discovery Institute page and concluded that this admission was itself the prank.\\"We should have known better‚ÄîEgnor fooled us all\\", Pharyngula, 2007-04-01. He made a point the following day that he perceived it as getting exceedingly difficult to believe some creationists were for real (cf. Poe's Law) and highlighted a quote by Stephen Meyer.\\"It's April 2nd!\\", Pharyngula, 2007-04-02.\\"The Silliest Thing Yet, or Sheer Genius?\\", Panda's Thumb, 2007-04-02. Memes =\\"Pygmies and dwarfs\\"= In June 2005, Myers criticized a cartoon by biblical literalist Jim Pinkoski which claimed that the Biblical line, \\"There were giants in the earth in those days,\\" (Genesis 6:4) was literally intended to convey that early humans were much taller than their modern counterparts. Pinkoski placed Adam at tall and Noah at tall. What Myers found most interesting about this cartoon, however, was the note on it which read, literally, \\"NOTE: If you doubt this is possible, how is it there are PYGMIES + DWARFS ??\\". Myers argued that the existence of pygmies and dwarfs now is a non sequitur when it comes to whether humans were tall 6,000 years ago. If Pinkoski's claims were valid, humans would perhaps continue to decrease in height and approach that small size at some time in the future, but this does not mean those small humans would exist now (barring the use of time travel, a claim Pinkoski never makes). Myers went on to mock the irrelevance of this argument with parodies such as: *Ever wonder how the hell a moron like George W. Bush got elected? \\"If you doubt this is possible, how is it there are PYGMIES + DWARFS??\\". *How can people be so gullible to believe the nonsense peddled by the Discovery Institute? \\"If you doubt this is possible, how is it there are PYGMIES + DWARFS??\\". The phrase has since been picked up by various bloggers to ridicule creationist arguments, and is also popular with commenters at The Panda's Thumb. The phrase is generally capitalized and bolded to match how it originally appeared in Pinkoski's cartoon.\\"If you doubt this is possible, how is it there are PYGMIES + DWARFS??\\", Pharyngula, 2005-06-14. =The courtier's reply= Myers has voiced the position that many of the responses to Richard Dawkins's The God Delusion are what he calls \\"Courtier's Replies\\". Replying to critics who felt that Dawkins ignored sophisticated versions of modern theology, Myers compared them to courtiers fawning on the legendary emperor who had no clothes: In other words, critics complain about Dawkins not studying aspects of theology that are irrelevant to whether or not God exists in the same way as scholarly writings about imperial fashion are irrelevant when the emperor is naked. Dawkins himself quoted the Courtier's Reply in a debate with Alister McGrath. He also referenced the Courtier's Reply in the preface to The God Delusion's 2007 paperback edition. See also =Blake's Law= Another recurring trope has been Myers's reaction to the label \\"fundamentalist atheist\\", bestowed by some upon him, Dawkins and others who espouse similar views. Myers writes, > The \\"new atheism\\" (I don't like that phrase, either) is about taking a core > set of principles that have proven themselves powerful and useful in the > scientific world -- you've probably noticed that many of these uppity > atheists are coming out of a scientific background -- and insisting that > they also apply to everything else people do. These principles are a > reliance on natural causes and demanding explanations in terms of the real > world, with a documentary chain of evidence, that anyone can examine. The > virtues are critical thinking, flexibility, openness, verification, and > evidence. The sins are dogma, faith, tradition, revelation, superstition, > and the supernatural. There is no holy writ, and a central idea is that > everything must be open to rational, evidence-based criticism -- it's the > opposite of fundamentalism. Eventually, Myers summarized his stance by invoking \\"Blake's Law\\", named for Pharyngula commentator Blake Stacey. As formulated by Stacey in 2007, based in concept on Godwin's Law: > In any discussion of atheism (skepticism, etc.), the probability that > someone will compare a vocal atheist to religious fundamentalists increases > to one. =Feminism= Myers is strongly feminist and has written about discrimination against women. =\\"Deep rifts\\"= Myers has made frequent use of the phrase \\"deep rifts\\" to satirize perceptions that atheism could experience a religious schism over disagreements on marketing atheism or the role of science and religion. Myers does not deny there are some differences of opinion between prominent atheists, but contends this is a good thing and is attributed to the freethinking nature of atheism.

It was founded in 1874 by James White in Oakland, California, and is now located in Nampa, Idaho. Its titles include theological works as well as books on topics such as vegetarianism and home schooling and owns its own printing operation. It is owned by the North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists. History The Seventh-day Adventist Church was formally organized and named in 1863. It began to realize its great mission to go into all the world and preach the gospel. Consequently, Elders J.N. Loughborough and D.T. Bourdeau came to California in 1866. And by May 1871, there were 130 Adventists in California in the San Francisco and Santa Rosa area. Late in 1872, James and Ellen White and their two sons, Willie and James Edson, came to California in the interest of the newly established work of the church on the Pacific Coast. Plans were laid for the establishment of a health institute and a branch publishing house. However, no funds were available, nor was a site yet secured. One day while crossing the ferry from San Francisco to Oakland, Mrs. White through inspiration spoke to her husband. \\"Somewhere in Oakland,\\" she said, \\"is the place to locate the paper.\\" So, in 1874, James White began to publish the Signs of the Times in Oakland. It was printed under the aegis of \\"Elder James White, Editor and Proprietor.\\" The date of the first issue, June 4, 1874. The subscription price \\"$2.00 a year to all those able to pay the subscription price, and free to all others as far as the paper is sustained by donations of liberal friends of the cause.\\" These were the terms. In the fall of 1874 at a camp meeting in Yountville, the president of the California Conference, Elder Loughborough, presented the need of a publishing house to the people assembled. That day $19,414 was given in gold and in pledges. There were less than 500 members in the congregation. Soon, construction of a plant on Castro Street in Oakland began. This became known as the Pacific Seventh- day Adventist Publishing Association. Equipment installed included a four- roller air spring drum cylinder press powered by an upright donkey engine, a paper cutter, a book trimmer, and some new type. Soon the Signs of the Times circulation had passed 4,000. By 1887, the investment of Pacific Press had grown to $200,000, and the annual business totaled $150,000. From its beginning, the Press prospered. The press became well known on the West Coast for its quality work and prompt delivery of printing orders. Around the start of the 20th century, the subscription list of Signs of the Times was nearly 50,000. Retail sales of the book department amounted to $94,000. However, commercial work continued to occupy an important place in production. At times, denominational work was set aside to accommodate the commercial. It was felt that commercial work was necessary to keep the machinery going and profits coming in. Mrs. White encouraged management to move away from the city, which was developing so rapidly around the plant. The town of Mountain View wished to raise its status in the state. The town leaders, upon hearing that the Pacific Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association in Oakland, which had gained a fair and growing reputation, was looking for a more rural atmosphere in which to establish itself, offered the Press five choice acres of land as well as a pair of lots for a church or meeting house. The Press accepted the offer of the of land, and in 1904 they moved to Mountain View. Along with the plant came the families. As a result, real estate in Mountain View began to advance, and area business grew. A brick building soon took shape on the land donated by the town, and work began to come in from customers who patronized the plant in Oakland. Mrs. White implored Management to rely on God alone and give up the commercial work that had followed them from Oakland and had received priority over church publications. At 5:18 in the morning of April 18, 1906, a great earthquake convulsed the whole bay area. The walls of the plant crumbled. Its offices were in shambles. Yet, within a few days the presses were running again. On July 20, three months after the earthquake, on a Friday about midnight, a fire of undetermined origin broke through the roof in the northeast corner of the photoengraving room. In two hours the entire building had become a blazing inferno. Although the fire was finally subdued, it was not entirely extinguished, and it broke out a second time. This time scarcely a charred board remained. The paper stock of the plant, finished books, type plates, manuscripts ‚Äì all were destroyed. Suddenly, all the warnings of Mrs. White came to mind. Soon after the fire the Board of Directors stopped commercial work at the Pacific Press. In 1955 ownership of Chapel Records was transferred from the Pacific Union Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists to Pacific Press Publishing Association. In 1982, the press lost an appeal in a case against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission wherein the court denied that the press could obtain a Title VII exemption to the employment code that would allow them to treat male and female employees differently.EEOC v.

Loma Linda, Calif. : Mars Hill Publications, c1985. 356 p. ; 22 cm. By the early 1980s, the cost-of-living index in the densely populated San Francisco Bay area made it almost impossible for young families to work at the plant. This, among other reasons, made it expedient to move the plant from Mountain View. In 1983, the Board of Trustees, along with the General Conference Committee voted that the plant be sold and a move made to another area. Nampa, Idaho, was chosen as the location for the new plant. The new building contained of floor space. Relocation to Idaho began in June 1984 and was completed in the late winter of 1984-85. The move to Idaho was an advantageous one. From the humble beginning in 1874 when the first Signs of the Times was issued, with Elder James White editing the paper, setting the type, and printing the pages, and with his son as a delivery boy, the institution has grown to become the employer of over 250 workers at a plant larger than three football fields and generating an annual income of over $40 million. Pacific Press is the largest bulk mailer in Idaho. In 1994, Pacific Press began management of literature evangelist work with the establishment of the HHES (Home Health Education Services) Division. Currently, the HHES manages literature evangelist programs for Pacific Union, North Pacific Union, and Mid America Union. The Retail Division for management of Adventist Book Centers was begun in 1996. The Division operated retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, and operated a bookmobile program in the mountain states region. In August, 2013, the Pacific Press board voted to return management of the stores operated by the Retail Division to the local Seventh-day Adventist conferences. Pacific Press closed the last of its Retail Division in the United States in the second half of 2014. Operations in Canada are expected to be closed by year end.

Nomenclature The name Vasistha in the title of the text refers to Rishi Vasistha.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , page 7 The term Yoga in the text refers to the underlying Yogic theme in its stories and dialogues, and the term is used in a generic sense to include all forms of yoga in the pursuit of liberation, in the style of Bhagavad Gita. The long version of the text is called Brihat Yoga Vasistha, wherein Brihat means \\"great or large\\". The short version of the text is called Laghu Yoga Vasishta, wherein Laghu means \\"short or small\\". The longer version is also referred to simply as Yoga Vasistha and by numerous other names such as Vasi·π£·π≠ha Ramayana. Chronology The date or century of the text's composition or compilation is unknown, and variously estimated from the content and references it makes to other literature, other schools of Indian philosophies. Scholars agree that the surviving editions of the text were composed in the common era, but disagree whether it was completed in the first millennium or second. Estimates range, states Chapple, from \\"as early as the sixth or seventh century, to as late as the fourteenth century\\". The surviving text mentions Vijnanavada and Madhyamika schools of Buddhism by name, suggesting that the corresponding sections were composed after those schools were established, or about 5th- century. The translation of a version of the text in 14th- to 15th-century into Persian, has been the basis of the other limit, among scholars such as Farquhar in 1922. Atreya in 1935 suggested that the text must have preceded Gaudapada and Adi Shankara, because it does not use their terminology, but does mention many Buddhist terms. Dasgupta, a contemporary of Atreya, states that the text includes verses of earlier text, such as its III.16.50 is identical to one found in Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava, thus the text must be placed after the 5th-century. Dasgupta adds that the philosophy and ideas presented in Yoga Vasistha mirror those of found in Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara, but neither mention the other, which probably means that the author(s) of Yoga Vasistha were scholars who lived in the same century as Shankara, placing the text in about 7th- to early 8th-century. The shorter summary version of the text is attributed to the Kashmiri scholar Abhinanda, who has been variously dated to have lived in 9th- or 10th-century. =Evolving text theory= Mainkar states that Yoga Vasistha probably evolved over time. The first work, states Mainkar, was the original ancient work of Vasistha that was an Upanishad with Brahamanical ideas, a work that is lost. This text was, suggests Mainkar, was expanded into Moksopaya in or after 6th- century, which is now commonly known as Laghu-Yogavasistha. The Laghu (shorter) version was then expanded into the full editions, over time, in the centuries that followed the completion of Laghu-Yogavasistha. The syncretic incorporation of Buddhism and Hinduism ideas happened in the Laghu- Yogavasistha edition, states Mainkar, while ideas from Kashmiri Shaivism, particularly the Trika school, were added to the growing version by the 12th- century. Similar serial expansion, revisions and interpolation is typical in Indian literature. Peter Thomi has published additional evidence in support Mainkar's theory on Yoga Vasistha's chronology.Peter Thomi (1983), The Yogavasistha in its longer and shorter version, Journal of Indian philosophy, volume 11, number 1, pages 107-116. The oldest surviving manuscript of the Moksopaya (or Moksopaya Shastra) has been dated to have been composed in Srinagar in the 10th century AD.Slaje, Walter. (2005). \\"Locating the Mok·π£opƒÅya\\", in: Hanneder, J√ºrgen (Ed.). The Mok·π£opƒÅya, YogavƒÅsi·π£·π≠ha and Related Texts Aachen: Shaker Verlag. (Indologica Halensis. Geisteskultur Indiens. 7). p. 35.Gallery ‚Äì The journey to the Pradyumna≈õikhara Author The text is traditionally attributed to Valmiki, the author of Ramayana. The author of the shorter version, the Laghu-Yogavasistha, is generally considered to be Abhinanda of Kashmir. Structure The text exists in many editions of manuscripts with varying number of verses, but similar message. The full editions contain over 29,000, to a few with 32,000 verses, and in some editions about 36,000 verses.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , page 8 with footnote An abridged version by Abhinanda of Kashmir (son of Jayanta Bhatta) is Laghu (\\"Little\\") Yogavasistha and contains 6,000 verses. The verses of Yoga Vasistha are structured in the genre of ancient Indian literature, called Grantha. In this genre, each Shloka (verse) in the text is designed to equal 32 syllables, while conveying its message. A Grantha can be sung and depending on its meter, set to specific Raga music. This genre is found in Bhakti movement literature, and Yoga Vasistha's Advaita theories and monism influenced the Grantha literature of Sikhism, whose primary scripture is called Guru Granth Sahib.Opinder jit Kaur Takhar (2005), Sikh Identity: An Exploration of Groups Among Sikhs, Ashgate, , page 145 The Yoga Vasistha is a syncretic work, containing elements of Vedanta, Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta, Jainism and Mahayana Buddhism, thus making it, according to Chapple, \\"a Hindu text par excellence, including, as does Hinduism, a mosaic- style amalgam of diverse and sometimes opposing traditions\\". The text consists of six books: *Book 1: titled Vairagya-prakaranam (Exposition of dispassion), which opens with Rama frustrated with the nature of life, human suffering and disdain for the world. *Book 2: titled Mumukshuvayahara-prakaranam (Exposition of the behavior of the seeker), which describes, through the character of Rama, the desire for liberation, the nature of those who seek such liberation, and the need for self-effort in all spiritual pursuits. *Book 3: titled Utpatti-prakaranam (Exposition of the arising and birth), describes the birth of all creation as well as the birth of spiritual side of Rama. *Book 4: titled Sthiti-prakaranam (Exposition of the existence and settling), describes the nature of world and many non-dualism ideas with numerous stories. It emphasizes free will and human creative power. *Book 5: titled Upashama- prakaranam (Exposition of the patience and tranquility), discusses meditation to dissolution of false dualism, to feel oneness and its powers in liberating the individual. *Book 6: titled Nirvana-prakaranam (Exposition of the freedom and liberation), the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful Rama. The last book also has large sections on Yoga. The Nirnaya Sagar version of Yoga Vasistha manuscript has 1146 verses in the first Book, 807 in second, 6304 verses in third, 2414 verses in the fourth book, 4322 in the fifth, while the last is longest with 14296 verses, for a cumulative total of 29,289 verses. Content This is one of the longest Hindu texts in Sanskrit after the Mahabharata, and an important text of Yoga. It consists of numerous short stories and anecdotes used to help illustrate its ideas and message. The text shows the influence of Advaita Vedanta and Saivite Trika school. In terms of Hindu mythology, the conversation in the Yoga Vasishta is placed chronologically before the Ramayana. The traditional belief is that reading this book leads to spiritual liberation. The conversation between Vasistha and Prince Rama is that between a great, enlightened sage and a seeker of liberation. The text discusses consciousness, cosmology, nature of the universe and consciousness, the ultimate dissolution of body, the liberation of the soul and the non-dual nature of existence. = On Human Intellect = The Yoga VƒÅsi·π£·π≠ha states the following on the credibility of the provider and seeker of knowledge through these magnificent words. > 'Even a young boy's words are to be accepted if they are words of wisdom, > else, reject it like straw even if uttered by BrahmƒÅ the creator.' =On who is ready for spiritual knowledge= The Yoga Vasistha states that there are four characteristics that mark someone ready for spiritual journey who:KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , pages 43 with footnotes, 108-109, 381-384 #Senses the difference between atman (soul) and non-atman #Is past cravings for anyone or anything, is indifferent to the enjoyments of objects in this world or after #Is virtuous and ethical with Sama (equality),Sama Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany Dama (self-restraint, temperance), Uparati (quietism),Uparati Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany Titiksha (patience, endurance),Titiksha Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany Sandhana (uniting, peace)Samdhana Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany and Sraddha (faith, trust)zraddha Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany #Has Mumukshatawa, that is longing for meaning in life and liberation =On the process of spiritual knowledge= Yoga Vasistha teachings are divided into six parts: dispassion, qualifications of the seeker, creation, existence, dissolution and liberation. It sums up the spiritual process in the seven Bhoomikas: # ≈öubhecchƒÅ (longing for the Truth): The yogi (or sƒÅdhaka) rightly distinguishes between permanent and impermanent; cultivates dislike for worldly pleasures; acquires mastery over his physical and mental faculties; and feels a deep yearning to be free from Sa·πÉsƒÅra. # VicƒÅra·πáa (right inquiry): The yogi has pondered over what he or she has read and heard, and has realized it in his or her life. # TanumƒÅnasa (attenuation ‚Äì or thinning out ‚Äì of mental activities): The mind abandons the many, and remains fixed on the One. # SattvƒÅpatti (attainment of sattva, \\"reality\\"): The Yogi, at this stage, is called Brahmavid (\\"knower of Brahman\\"). In the previous four stages, the yogi is subject to sa√±cita, PrƒÅrabdha and ƒÄgamƒ´ forms of karma. He or she has been practicing Sampraj√±ƒÅta SamƒÅdhi (contemplation), in which the consciousness of duality still exists. # Asa·πÉsakti (unaffected by anything): The yogi (now called Brahmavidvara) performs his or her necessary duties, without a sense of involvement. # PadƒÅrtha abhƒÅvana (sees Brahman everywhere): External things do not appear to exist to the yogi (now called Brahmavidvarƒ´yas); in essence there is a non-cognition of 'objects' as the separation between subject and a distinct object is dissolved; and tasks get performed without any sense of agency (doership). Sa√±cita and ƒÄgamƒ´ karma are now destroyed; only a small amount of PrƒÅrabdha karma remains. # Turƒ´ya (perpetual samƒÅdhi): The yogi is known as Brahmavidvari·π£·π≠ha and does not perform activities, either by his will or the promptings of others. =On liberation= In Chapter 2 of Book VI, titled as The story of Iksvaku, the text explains the state of nirvana (liberation) as follows, \\"Liberation is peace. Liberation is extinction of all conditioning. Liberation is freedom from every kind of physical, psychological and psychic distress. This world is not seen by the ignorant and the wise in the same light. To one who has attained self-knowledge, this world does not appear as samsara, but as the one infinite and indivisible consciousness\\".Swami Venkatesananda (1993), Vasistha's Yoga, SUNY Press, , page 528 =On Jivanmukta= The Yoga Vasistha describes the Jivanmukta, or liberated person, as follows (abridged from the 1896 translation by KN Aiyer): * He associates with the wise. He has reached the state of mind, which sees happiness everywhere. To him, neither sacrificial fires, nor Tapas, nor bounteous gifts nor holy waters have any meaning. He is replete with wisdom and friendly to all.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , pages 107-108 * He is desireless and in his eyes there is nothing supernatural. His state is indescribable and yet he will move in the world like anybody else. His mind will not be bound by any longings after Karmas. He will be indifferent to joy or pains arising from good or bad results. He will preserve a pleasant position in the happy enjoyment of whatever he obtains.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , pages 110-111, 129-130 * He is never affected by anything, whether he is in a state of Jiva consciousness or state of Shiva devoid of the Jiva consciousness. * He is same whether he moves in a family or is a solitary recluse. * He feels unbound by the delusions of Srutis and Smritis. * Nothing matters to him, he is unaffected by griefs or pleasures. He is distant, he is close, he in the one Reality of Atman. He is neither clingy nor arrogant. * He has no fear of anyone, no anger against anyone.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , pages 349-350, 701-703 * When the attraction towards external objects ceases, then there yet remains the internal craving which is called Trishna (thirst). The Jivanmukta is beyond Trishna. He is, not becoming. He does not even long for salvation. He is content. * A Jivanmukta will always transact his present duties, but neither longs for things in the future, nor ruminates upon things of the past. * He is a child amongst children; as old men amongst the old; as the puissant amongst the puissant; as a youth amongst the young, compassionate and understanding with the grieved.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , pages 466-467 * In him is found nobleness, benevolence, love, clearness of intellect.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , pages 332-333 =On Samsara and reality= The Yoga Vasistha describes samsara and reality as follows: * Samsara is mundane existence with rebirths.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , page 43 * The universe is full of Samsara driven by Moha (delusion), bondage, Tamas (destructive, chaotic behaviors), Mala (impurity), Avidya and Maya.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , page 118 * Ignorance feeds samsara, self-knowledge liberates.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , pages 286-287 * Samsara is ephemeral and unreal. With birth, death is inevitable.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , pages 306-307 Commentaries The following traditional Sanskrit commentaries on the Yoga Vasistha are extant:Surendranath Dasgupta (1932, Reprinted in 1978), A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, ISBN , pages 231-232 :* VƒÅsi·π£·π≠ha-rƒÅmƒÅya·πáa-candrikƒÅ by AdvayƒÅra·πáya (son of Narahari) :* TƒÅtparya prakƒÅ≈õa by ƒÅnanda Bodhendra Sarasvatƒ´ :* BhƒÅ·π£ya by Ga·πÖgƒÅdharendra :* Pada candrikƒÅ by MƒÅdhava Sarasvatƒ´ Influence Yoga Vasistha is considered one of the most important texts of the Vedantic philosophy.The Himalayan Masters: A Living Tradition, pp 37, by Pandit Rajmani Tigunait, Contributor Irene Petryszak, Edition: illustrated, revised, Published by Himalayan Institute Press, 2002, , The text, states David Gordon White, has served as a reference on Yoga for medieval era Advaita Vedanta scholars. The Yoga Vasistha, adds White, was one of the popular texts on Yoga that dominated the Indian Yoga culture scene before the 12th-century. Indian freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar has praised Yoga Vasistha. Quotes from his Autobiography \\"My Transportation For Life\\":Savarkar,Vinayak D. \\"My Transportation for Life\\" pp.151 http://www.savarkarsmarak.com/activityimages/My%20Transportation%20to%20Life.pdf :* \\"All of a sudden I fell upon the Yoga Vashistha, and I found it of such absorbing interest that I have come to regard it ever since as the best work on the Vedanta Philosophy. The propositions were so logical, the verse is so beautiful, and the exposition is so thorough and penetrating that the soul loses itself in raptures over it. Such a fine combination of philosophy and poetry is a gift reserved only for Sanskrit poets\\" :*\\"When I used to be lost in the reading of the Yoga Vashistha, the coil of rope I was weaving dropped automatically from my hands; and, for hours on end I lost the sense of possessing the body and the senses associated with that body. My foot would not move and my hand was at a stand still. I felt the deeper yearning to surrender it all. All propaganda, all work seemed such a worthless task, a sheer waste of life. At last the mind and the matter asserted their sway over the body and swung it back to work again\\" The practice of atma-vichara, \\"self- enquiry,\\" described in the Yoga Vasistha, has been popularised due to the influence of Ramana Maharshi, who was strongly influenced by this text.

The song is a ballad, in which Romuald reminisces about a girl he went to kindergarten with called Catherine. He sings that he was already in love with her then, and while they have lost touch since that time, he retains his feelings for her. The song ends with his question as to whether she has found love herself, and it is unclear whether he wants her to have done so.

Struthers, 319 U.S. 141 (1943), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a law prohibiting the distribution of handbills from door to door violated the First Amendment rights of a Jehovah's Witness, specifically their freedom of speech. The ruling was 5-4 5-4 and deemed trespassing laws a better fit for the town imposing the ordinance. Background Historically, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses often ran into conflict when going door to door distributing their religious pamphlets and information. They were often met with violence and/or arrest for practicing what they saw as their constitutional rights of religion and freedom of speech. In 1943, a woman from Struthers, Ohio by the name of Thelma Martin went knocking on doors to pass out Jehovah's Witness leaflets to people in her city. Martin's visits were not well received by some households which led to her arrest. She was convicted \\"in the Mayor's Court\\" and fined$10.00 for violating a Struthers, Ohio city ordinance which made it illegal to knock on doors to distribute handouts to that contained information about religious meetings. Martin confessed to handing out invitations to their religious meetings. The city ordinance was created to keep solicitors from coming to people's home and causing a disturbance. Martin's argument was that the city ordinance violated her First Amendment as well as her Fourteenth Amendment rights. Opinion of the Court The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the lower court. The Court held that the First Amendment protects both \\"the right to distribute literature\\" and \\"the right to receive it\\" and stated that the distribution of literature is protected \\"even if it creates the minor nuisance for a community of cleaning litter from its streets.\\" Justice Hugo Black, writing the opinion of the court, stated, > While door to door distributers of literature may be either a nuisance or a > blind for criminal activities, they may also be useful members of society > engaged in the dissemination of ideas in accordance with the best tradition > of free discussion. ... The ordinance does not control anything but the > distribution of literature, and in that respect, it substitutes the judgment > of the community for the judgment of the individual householder. It submits > the distributor to criminal punishment for annoying the person on whom he > calls, even though the recipient of the literature distributed is, in fact, > glad to receive it. ... In any case the problem must be worked out by each > community for itself with due respect for the constitutional rights of those > desiring to distribute literature and those desiring to receive it, as well > as those who choose to exclude such distributors from the home. ... We > conclude that the ordinance is invalid because [it is] in conflict with the > freedom of speech and press. Therefore, Martin won her right to distribute information. =Dissents= Justices Reed, Roberts and Jackson dissented. Justice Reed wrote that > The most ... that can be or has been read into the ordinance is a > prohibition of free distribution of printed matter by summoning inmates to > their doors. There are excellent reasons to support a determination of the > city council that such distributors may not disturb householders while > permitting salesmen and others to call them to the door. Practical > experience may well convince the council that irritations arise frequently > from this method of advertising. The classification is certainly not > discriminatory. ... To prohibit such a call leaves open distribution of the > notice on the street or at the home without signal to announce its deposit. > Such assurance of privacy falls far short of an abridgment of freedom of the > press.

Born in Wewoka, Oklahoma, Goss threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He spent nine years in minor league baseball, hitting 172 home runs, before making his first Major League team, the 1962 Pirates. He was mostly a late-inning replacement that season for regular leftfielder Bob Skinner, a left-handed batter, although Goss did start 15 games in right field, normally the domain of Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente. He showed some power potential with a .351 slugging average playing in cavernous Forbes Field. In the closing days of spring training in 1963, Goss was traded to the Colt .45s for a then-unknown 25-year-old outfielder, Manny Mota. While Goss would be Houston's regular 1963 centerfielder, he batted only .209 in 411 at bats and finished his professional career in the minor leagues in 1964. Mota went on to play 19 more seasons in the National League, and became particularly well known for his pinch hitting, at one time holding the Major League record for pinch hits. Howie Goss appeared in 222 Major League games, with 522 at bats. His 113 hits including 24 doubles and 11 home runs. He died at age 61 in Reno, Nevada.

L'Assembl√©e des six-comt√©s (French for \\"The Assembly of the Six Counties\\"), also known as Manifestation des Canadiens contre le gouvernement anglais, √† Saint-Charles, en 1837 (\\"Demonstration of the Canadiens against the English government, at Saint-Charles, in 1837\\"), is a large oil painting executed on canvas by Ontario artist Charles Alexander Smith in 1890.\\"¬´ Je me souviens ¬ª. When Art Imagines History\\", in mnba.qc.ca, retrieved Sept. 17, 2011 It depicts the Assembly of the Six Counties, an event in 1837, part of the history of Quebec and the Patriote movement. It is displayed in the permanent exhibition of the Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec in Quebec City. Composition The picture includes many elements of what is known about the Patriote movement and their time. It features a number of Patriote leaders, upon the stage at the right, with accurate appearance. Patriote leader Louis-Joseph Papineau is shown in a speech to the crowd. At the bottom right stand three flags. From the left, the first represents the influence the Patriotes received from the French Revolution, the second is the Patriote flag and the third embodies the admiration of the Patriote for the American Revolution. The Patriote flag remains a visual leitmotiv across the composition. The right field profusely displays maple leaves, a symbol of the French Canadians of the time (they have now been discarded by their modern-day Qu√©b√©cois and Quebec nationalist successors because of their appropriation by the Canadian federation). In the same section is the Coat of arms of Quebec, leaning upon the wooden stage structure (one anachronistic detail, as this version, contemporary to the painting's execution, is the first arms of Quebec post- Confederation, granted in 1868). The crowd, mesmerized and invigorated at the same time by Papineau's much celebrated oratory skills, holds many signs reading nationalist and independence slogans. Many in attendance wear the tuques and ceintures fl√©ch√©es belts characteristic of the Patriote symbology. The Colonne de la libert√© stands tall in the background (the one from Henri Julien's illustration and the contemporary replica appear much shorter). Finally, a very young girl at the immediate left-of-the-middle evocatively stares at the spectator. History Smith was commissioned to paint it for display in the chamber of the Legislative Assembly in the Parliament of Quebec City. However, the government of Premier of Quebec Charles-Eug√®ne Boucher de Boucherville did not accept it, and the work was passed unto various owners before finally becoming part of the Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec collection. Located in Room 10, it is a part of the permanent exhibition of Quebec history-related art called Je me souviens : Quand l‚Äôart imagine l‚Äôhistoire (\\"Je me souviens [motto of Quebec]. When Art Imagines History\\"). The picture has seen restoration. Nowadays, a great number of books related to the Patriotes, or their era in Quebec, use the painting, often cropped, to illustrate their cover page. In a similar fashion, initial plans to erect a statue in honour of Louis-Joseph Papineau on the Quebec City Parliament Hill were aborted because of the then-controversial aspect of what was seen as a revolutionary figure. A smaller statue was instead made for interior display in the Parliament and a monument such as the one originally envisioned was inaugurated in the 2000s. Subject The Assembly of the Six Counties gathered Patriote leaders and approximately 4,000 followers in Saint-Charles, Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) on October 23 and October 24, 1837. Presided by Wolfred Nelson, it is the most famous of the various popular assemblies held during that year protesting the Russell Resolutions. It was a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 that sought the independence of a Lower Canadian republic. Speakers were united in their protest of the British colonial government, but, as one part supported economic boycotts of British products, the other appealed to an armed uprising.

She was a Victory ship design, VC2-S-AP5. She was named after Missoula County, Montana, United States, and was the second ship to bear the name . Construction Missoula was laid down 20 June 1944, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCV hull 559, by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2, Richmond, California; launched 6 September 1944; sponsored by the Harmonettes, a female vocal group; acquired by the Navy 27 October 1944; and commissioned at Richmond, the same day, Commander Alexander C. Kopper in command. Service history After shakedown along the California coast, Missoula steamed from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor 6 to 12 December. She trained in Hawaiian waters during the next 6 weeks; thence, with units of the 5th Marine Division embarked, she sailed 27 January 1945, for the scheduled invasion of Iwo Jima. Among her troops she carried the men who on two separate occasions raised the American flag atop Mount Suribachi during bitter fighting 23 February. Assigned to Transport Squadron 16, she steamed via Eniwetok to the staging area at Saipan, where she completed final preparations for the invasion. =Invasion of Iwo Jima= Missoula sortied with Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill‚Äôs TF 53 on 16 February. She reached the transport area off Beach Green 1 before dawn 19 February, lowered her landing boats, and at 07:25 began debarking troops for the assault. As Marines stormed the beaches and began the struggle for Iwo Jima, Missoula sent ashore troops and cargo from her position about offshore. Late in the afternoon she departed the transport area for night cruising at sea; thence, she returned the following morning and resumed unloading operations. During the next 5 days she continued this pattern of operations. Raising the Flag on Mount Suribachi While operating in the transport area 23 February, she received the following message at 10:35: ‚ÄúAmerican flag now flying on Mount Suribachi Yama.‚Äù Three Marines from Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, had raised the national colors from the summit of Mount Suribachi at 10:20. That flag, the first of two which flew from Mount Suribachi that day, the second flag was a larger replacement flag, had come from Missoula. The 2nd Battalion adjutant, whose job it was to carry the flag, had brought the small set of colors from the attack transport during the invasion. Medical assistance ‚Äì return to Saipan In addition, Missoula provided medical facilities for casualties of the fierce fighting ashore. Her four surgical teams treated 100 stretcher and ambulatory cases, 59 of whom were brought on board during the first day. After embarking a final group of casualties, she sailed in convoy for Saipan 25 February. The following morning one of the convoy escorts, , detected, depth-charged, and sank Japanese submarine I-370. Missoula arrived Saipan 28 February; and, after debarking the wounded marines, she sailed for the New Hebrides with Transport Squadron 16 on 5 March. =Invasion of Okinawa= Steaming via Tulagi, Missoula reached Espiritu Santo 15 March and there embarked 1,177 Army troops of the 27th Division. She departed with other transports 25 March, touched at Ulithi 3 April, and arrived off the western beaches of Okinawa 9 April. During the next 5 days she discharged men and supplies and embarked 143 casualties of the Okinawa campaign; thence, between 14 and 18 April she steamed to Saipan. =Training for invasion of Japan= For much of the next month Missoula operated out of Ulithi after which she headed for troop training exercises in the Philippines. She arrived Subic Bay, Luzon, 31 May, and during the closing weeks of the war against Japan, she took part in preparing Army troops for a possible amphibious invasion of Japan. Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese ended hostilities 15 August; thence, Missoula supported the movement of occupation troops into Japan. =Transporting troops to Japan= As part of TF 33, Missoula departed Subic Bay 27 August. She entered Tokyo Bay on the morning of 2 September and began debarking troops of the 1st Cavalry Division at 09:51. Less than an hour before in another part of the bay, the Japanese Foreign Minister, Mamoru Shigemitsu, had signed the Instrument of Surrender on board , thus officially ending World War II. Missoula returned to the Philippines 4 to 11 September, and embarked additional occupation troops at Zamboanga and Mindanao. Departing Leyte Gulf 22 September, she arrived Okinawa 25 September, and on 3 October, sailed for the Inland Sea. Between 6 and 11 October, she debarked troops for the occupation of the rubble that was once Hiroshima. =Operation Magic Carpet= She returned to Okinawa 13 October and joined in the mighty task of returning veterans of the Pacific campaigns to the United States. With 1,923 troops embarked, Missoula sailed 17 October, and arrived San Francisco 1 November. She departed on a second ‚ÄúMagic Carpet‚Äù run 21 November, and on 6 December, embarked 2,060 soldiers at Okinawa. She steamed to Tacoma, Washington, 8 to 21 December; thence, she returned to the western Pacific 21 January 1946, for further trooplift duty. She carried 692 men of the 2d Marine Air Wing from Okinawa to Yokosuka early in February, embarked more than 2,000 veterans at Okinawa and Guam later that month, and departed Guam for the west coast 22 February. Missoula reached San Francisco 5 March, discharged her passengers, and completed her ‚ÄúMagic Carpet‚Äù duty. Assigned to the 19th Fleet 9 April, Missoula operated in the San Francisco Bay area during the next 5 months.  Fate  She decommissioned at Port Chicago, California, 13 September 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Mare Island. Her name was struck from the Navy list 1 October 1958. She transferred to the Maritime Administration the same day and was assigned to the National Defense Reserve Fleet. She was berthed in Suisun Bay, California on 29 October 1958. On 5 March 1977, she was sold to American Ship Dismantlers, Inc., for $218,001, to be scrapped. At 11:15 PDT, on 8 March 1975 she was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet and sent to the breaker's yard.

His credits included My Sister Eileen, which he produced both on stage and on film. Biography Born Mechel Salpeter, Gordon was the youngest son of immigrants from Poland. His older brother, Cliff, used the stage name of \\"Gordon,\\" and Max then used it also. Cliff, an entertainer in vaudeville, died at age 32 (in 1913). Then in his early 20s, Gordon within months formed a vaudeville agency with Albert Lewis, his late brother's former vaudeville and burlesque partner. They specialized in providing sketches for shows, and their material, and performers (e.g. Phil Baker and Lou Holtz), played the Keith and Orpheum circuits. It was on May 24, 1921, the tail end of this period- months before the team produced their first play- that Gordon wed Mildred Bartlett, of Amsterdam, New York. Bartlett gave up her acting career- she performed in films under the name Raye Dean- a few months before the wedding at the request of her fiance. Gordon soon became one of New York's most successful producers, from the Roaring Twenties and Depression-era on into the Eisenhower years.Gordon, Max [n√© Mechel Salpeter]. (1892-1978). Oxford Companion to American Theatre, 2004, p272. One of his first great hits came when he presented, with Lewis, the original stage incarnation of The Jazz Singer, which ran from September 1925 to June 1926.Listing ibdb.com, Accessed 01 Dec 2007. The year following the stock market crash of 1929- \\"Marx, the jig is up\\" is how he famously relayed the news to his friend and frequent tip recipient\\\\- Gordon became an independent producer.Cullen, Frank, Hackman, Florence, and McNeilly, Donald. Vaudeville, old & new (2007), Routledge, , p. 448 In 1930 he produced Three's A Crowd. By 1932, broke and suffering from a nervous collapse, such friends as \\"George Kaufman offered him fifteen hundred of the sixteen hundred dollars Kaufman had at that time, and Harpo Marx came to see him in the hospital with his pockets stuffed with cash and strewed it over the bed...\\" It was in these years that Gordon gradually became playwright Kaufman's producer of choice - 10 shows in 25 years- starting in 1931 with the Astaires' final musical, The Bandwagon. Gordon had even greater luck with the married playwrights Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. For Kanin's Born Yesterday - it ran 1,642 performances- producer Gordon even had a hand in discovering its star, Judy Holliday (\\"The minute she walked in, I knew she was it.\\"). His reputation during this era was immortalized in Cole Porter's song \\"Anything Goes\\" from the musical of the same name: When Rockefeller still can hoard enough money to let Max Gordon produce his shows-- Anything goes!

It is a major pest in cotton and one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species. It should not be confused with the similarly named, related species Helicoverpa zea. Distribution This species comprises two sub-species: Helicoverpa armigera armigera is widespread in central and southern Europe, temperate Asia and Africa; Helicoverpa armigera conferta is found in Australia, and Oceania. The former sub-species has also recently been confirmed to have successfully invaded Brazil and has since spread across much of South America and reached the Caribbean. It is a migrant species, able to reach Scandinavia and other northern territories. Morphology Eggs Larva Maize field habitat, Poland The cotton bollworm is very variable in both size and colour. The body length varies between with a wingspan of . The fore wings are yellowish to orange in females and greenish-gray in males, with a slightly darker transversal band in the distal third. The external transversal and submarginal lines and the reniform spot are diffused. The hind wings are a pale yellow with a narrow brown band at the external edge and a dark round spot in the middle. Lifecycle Lateral view Mounted, dorsal view Mounted, ventral view The female cotton bollworm can lay several hundred eggs, distributed on various parts of the plant. Under favourable conditions, the eggs can hatch into larvae within three days and the whole lifecycle can be completed in just over a month. The eggs are spherical and 0.4 to 0.6 mm in diameter, and have a ribbed surface. They are white, later becoming greenish. The larvae take 13 to 22 days to develop, reaching up to 40 mm long in the sixth instar. Their colouring is variable, but mostly greenish and yellow to red-brown. The head is yellow with several spots. Three dark stripes extend along the dorsal side and one yellow light stripe is situated under the spiracles on the lateral side. The ventral parts of the larvae are pale. They are rather aggressive, occasionally carnivorous and may even cannibalise each other. If disturbed, they fall from the plant and curl up on the ground. The pupae develop inside a silken cocoon over 10 to 15 days in soil at a depth of , or in cotton bolls or maize ears. Host plants The cotton bollworm is a highly polyphagous species. The most important crop hosts are tomato, cotton, pigeon pea, chickpea, rice, sorghum, and cowpea. Other hosts include groundnut, okra, peas, field beans, soybeans, lucerne, Phaseolus spp., other Leguminosae, tobacco, potatoes, maize, flax, Dianthus, Rosa, Pelargonium, Chrysanthemum, Lavandula angustifolia, a number of fruit trees, forest trees, and a range of vegetable crops. In Russia and adjacent countries, the larvae populate more than 120 plant species, favouring Solanum, Datura, Hyoscyamus, Atriplex, and Amaranthus genera. Economic significance The greatest damage is caused to cotton, tomatoes, maize, chick peas, alfalfa, and tobacco. The economic threshold of harmfulness in central Asia is three to five larvae per hundred plants of long-staple cotton and eight to 12 larvae per hundred plants on medium-staple cotton. In cotton crops, blooms that have been attacked may open prematurely and stay fruitless. When the bolls are damaged, some will fall off and others will fail to produce lint or produce lint of an inferior quality. Secondary infections by fungi and bacteria are common and may lead to rotting of fruits. Injury to the growing tips of plants may disturb their development, maturity may be delayed, and the fruits may be dropped. Control measures include the use of NOCTOVI adulticide attract and kill formulation,http://www.isca.com.br/pt/produtos/p/1dc95a44-9a83-4919-9fec-f9d3125bc3b4/noctovi NOCTOVI as an effective semiochemical attract and kill adulticide for the control of Helicoverpa armigera growing of resistant varieties, weeding, inter-row cultivation, removing crop residues, deep autumn ploughing, winter watering to destroy the pupae, the use of insecticides or biological control through the release of entomophages such as Trichogramma spp. and Habrobracon hebetor. Monitoring is possible by the use of sex pheromone traps.http://www.iscatech.com/ecommerce/index.php?main_page=product_info&products;_id=57 Helicoverpa armigera monitoring Sex Pheromone Lures Development of Bt cotton (genetically modified to produce Bacillus thuringiensis toxin) improved yields of lint. Genome analysis The genomes of Helicoverpa armigera conferta and Helicoverpa zea were published in July 2017.  Management  = Prevention = The CABI-led programme, Plantwise and their partners suggest planting trap crops and intercropping with crops including cowpea, sunflower, maize, marigold. They also recommend rotating with cereal crops and other non-host crops to prevent the population from building up. Partners of Plantwise suggest introducing spacing when planting, removing weeds, crop residues and volunteer crops. Introducing bird perches and providing habitats for natural enemies are methods that can be used to prevent pest populations building up. = Monitoring = The caterpillars feed on buds, flowers, grains, fruits, pods; sometimes leaves and stems. In cotton they are found on the vegetative part and reproductive structures. In corn, millet at sorghum they attack the grain. In tomato and beans caterpillars bore into young fruits and in chickpea they attack foliage and consume developing seeds. = Direct control = In small plots, Plantwise suggests handpicking and destroying eggs and young caterpillars is possible.

Background The song was written with the intent of using Canadian singer/performer Dallas Green (of Alexisonfire and City and Colour) as the featured vocalist. In a last- minute attempt to lift the sound of the album, Victor came up with \\"The Grace\\" during a late night writing session, only a month before the album went into stores. After capturing Dallas Green's vocal parts in Toronto, Ontario, the song was promptly mixed and released in Canada. Every instrument and part in the song was performed and recorded by Daniel Victor in his home studio in Windsor, Ontario, Canada (except for the violin parts). Commenting on the song's name, Victor stated that \\"...it's about someone's thoughts that dying could be a positive thing, a good transition to get away from the world...and the person in the song is trying to figure out where he really belongs in this world with the help of his angels...\\"[quoted from an e-mail reply written to a fan]. Themes of life and death are the main focus of Victor's debut album, and this song is no exception. Its original title was \\"The Grace of a Happy Death\\". Chart performance As the first single from the album, it received extensive radio play across the country, eventually charting #3 on Rock Radio and #1 the Rock Audience Chart. It also reached #1 on many popular radio station countdowns including Edge 102 in Toronto (for 2 weeks). Music video The music video is a cinematic blue-tinged love story between a man (played by Victor) and a fallen angel (played by musician Emm Gryner) in the Victorian era. It hit #1 on MuchMusic in April 2006, and on MuchMoreMusic for two weeks that same month. \\"The Grace\\" essentially launched Neverending White Lights into the Canadian spotlight. The video starts off with glimpses of statues of angels, and a camera clicking as they are filmed. It then leads to a scene of Victor mending the wings of a fallen angel in his home. As he sews the feathers in, a long and painful process, tears roll down the angel's cheeks. Victor wipes them off gently with a feather. Over the next few days as he finishes his work, plays music to her and shows her the film of the statues he'd taken earlier, it is evident he falls in love with her. Each day the angel puts on a white pendant with the figure of a woman on it, and Victor shows her a good time. But at last, Victor's work is done, and the grateful angel, with her new wings, touches his face gingerly before disappearing. She leaves the pendant behind. Heartbroken, Victor commits suicide, and the angel reappears then and stays by his side, grieving as the song ends with one final piano note.

It is usually held before the church service on Saturday morning, but this may vary. It includes programs that are Bible based, to foster Christian growth. This period usually lasts for a period of 1 hour 40 minutes. During this time the \\"lesson study\\" is also conducted. Activities Sabbath School usually begins at 9:30am or 10:30am on Saturday mornings before the worship service starts. The Sabbath School service for adults typically has two portions. The first portion begins with a song service, followed by a mission emphasis and a short talk. The second, and larger portion, is the lesson study. Different churches conduct Sabbath School in many ways, mostly teaching on the same topic or reading in a given week, as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible, doctrinal, or church lifestyle teachings. The lesson booklet is called the \\"quarterly.\\" Sabbath School may be conducted in one large class, or the congregation may separate into smaller groups for discussion in the sanctuary or in different rooms. Participation is not restricted to Church members. Young people often meet separately. After Sabbath School the church service begins, usually at 11:00am. On the last Sabbath of the quarter, or the 13th Sabbath, a special collection is taken for a missionary project. During the \\"13th Sabbath Program,\\" youngsters may present a music or acting special based on the subject learned that quarter or explain the traditions and dress in the attire of the countries or world regions which offerings collected will benefit. Communion Service preceded by footwashing may take place on or right after the 13th Sabbath. A 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders estimated that 67% of Adventists, including 63% of under-18s, \\"attend Sabbath School nearly every week\\".\\"Three Strategic Issues: A World Survey\\". General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 2002. See question 4, on p19 etc. For youth, see question 58 Teachers Sabbath School teachers are usually lay people selected by a designated coordinator, board, or committee. Normally, the selection is based on a perception of character and ability to teach the Bible rather than formal training in education, although some Sabbath School teachers have a background in education as a result of their occupation. Some churches offer courses in teaching, or hold teachers' classes to go over the lesson for that Sabbath; other churches allow volunteers who make a profession of faith to teach without training. Study guides (Seventh-day Adventist) =Adult lesson= Adult church members are provided with the Adult Bible Study Guide (formerly known as Sabbath School Quarterly) issued four times a year. It is also known as the \\"Quarterly\\"Pacific Press Publishing Association - Search and the \\"Lesson\\". It is published by Pacific Press Publishing Association. Sabbath School quarterlies are Bible study guides that cover a specific topic or book of the Bible every quarter. The quarterly is designed to be read during the week, so that during Sabbath School, the class members are ready to discuss questions and topics raised in that lesson in small groups. The Adult Sabbath School always has a heavy focus on the Bible. All Seventh-day Adventists around the world use the same Sabbath School quarterly, translated into the necessary languages (with few exceptions such as Germany, where members cover the same topic with different material). the editor of the Adult Sabbath School lessons was Clifford Goldstein. =Other lessons= At the same time as the adult study, children attend classes for their age group. Typical age group divisions are Beginner (infants), Kindergarten (K), Primary (Grades 1-3), Junior (Grades 4-6), Earliteen (Grades 7-8), Youth (High School), and Collegiate (College and Young Adult). Each age division has its own specific quarterly, which is titled by the class name up to Primary. Juniors and Earliteens often share the same quarterly entitled PowerPoints. Some Earliteen groups use a separate publication entitled Real Time Faith. Youth use either Cornerstone Connections or Collegiate Quarterly (CQ). Some churches give the children a weekly magazine at the close of Sabbath School. Kindergarten receives Our Little Friend, Primary receives Primary Treasure, Juniors and Earliteens receive Guide, and the Youth receive Insight.

FM stereo broadcasting is known to incur up to a 23 dB noise penalty over that of monophonic FM broadcasting; this is due to the combination of the triangular FM noise spectrum and the wider baseband bandwidth occupied by the stereo multiplex signal. Developed at the CBS Technology Center, FMX was intended to improve this characteristic for listeners in the fringe areas where the noise penalty would be worst. This improvement was achieved by adding an amplitude-compressed version of the L‚àíR (left-minus-right, or difference) signal modulated in quadrature with the stereo subcarrier, using a version of the CX noise-reduction system originally developed at CBS for LP records. Upon his accession as Chairman of CBS, Laurence Tisch closed the CBS labs in 1986, whereupon the FMX intellectual property was spun off to an investment group, under the name Broadcast Technology Partners (BTP). With about 50 stations using the technology and perhaps another 50 committed, a controversy emerged in 1989 when MIT professor and Bose Corporation CEO Amar Bose and Bose engineer William Short released a critical study, finding the system to have the potential to \\"seriously degrade the quality of stereo reception whether received by FMX equipment or not.\\" According to the study, the heavy compression of the L‚àíR audio caused interference in receivers under multipath conditions. A BTP spokesman rebutted the finding, saying that the Bose analysis exaggerated a \\"worst-case scenario\\", and actually employed \\"flawed mathematics\\" to attempt to prove their point. Perhaps not coincidentally, a patent application filed earlier by BoseUS4821322: FM multiplex decoding disclosed an invention whose implementation was incompatible with the adoption of FMX, while another ‚Äì filed by Bose and Short around the time of the release of the critical study ‚Äì sought to improve the performance of FMX under multipath conditions.US5046129: Reducing phase error in received FM multiplex signal Despite industrial supporters in both the broadcast and consumer electronics industries, the system never achieved a critical mass, and faded into obscurity.

It is used for the analysis and purification of low to moderate molecular weight, thermally labile molecules and can also be used for the separation of chiral compounds. Principles are similar to those of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), however SFC typically utilizes carbon dioxide as the mobile phase; therefore the entire chromatographic flow path must be pressurized. Because the supercritical phase represents a state in which liquid and gas properties converge, supercritical fluid chromatography is sometimes called convergence chromatography. Applications SFC is used in industry primarily for separation of chiral molecules, and uses the same columns as standard HPLC systems. SFC is now commonly used for achiral separations and purifications in the pharmaceutical industry. Apparatus SFC with CO2 utilizes carbon dioxide pumps that require that the incoming CO2 and pump heads be kept cold in order to maintain the carbon dioxide at a temperature and pressure that keeps it in a liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate. The CO2 subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the column oven when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved. SFC as a chromatographic process has been likened to a process having the combined properties of the power of a liquid to dissolve a matrix, with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of a gas. The result is that you can get a lot of mass on column per injection, and still maintain a high chromatographic efficiency. Typically, gradient elution is employed in analytical SFC using a polar co-solvent such as methanol, possibly with a weak acid or base at low concentrations ~1%. The effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed 500K plates per metre routinely with 5 um material. The operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate, co-solvent composition, system back pressure and column oven temperature which must exceed 40 ¬∞C for supercritical conditions to be achieved with CO2. In addition, SFC provides an additional control parameter - pressure - by using an automated back pressure regulator. From an operational standpoint, SFC is as simple and robust as HPLC but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and a small volume of polar co-solvent. If the outlet CO2 is captured, it can be recompressed and recycled, allowing for >90% reuse of CO2. Similar to HPLC, SFC uses a variety of detection methods including UV/VIS, mass spectrometry, FID (unlike HPLC) and evaporative light scattering. Sample preparation A rule-of-thumb is that any molecule that will dissolve in methanol or a less polar solvent is compatible with SFC, including polar solutes. CO2 has polarity similar to n-heptane at its critical point, but the solvent strength can be increased by increasing density or using a polar cosolvent. In practice, when the fraction of cosolvent is high, the mobile phase is not truly supercritical, but this terminology is used regardless. Mobile phase The mobile phase is composed primarily of supercritical carbon dioxide, but since CO2 on its own is too non-polar to effectively elute many analytes, cosolvents are added to modify the mobile phase polarity. Cosolvents are typically simple alcohols like methanol, ethanol, or isopropyl alcohol. Other solvents such as acetonitrile, chloroform, or ethyl acetate can be used as modifiers. For food-grade materials, the selected cosolvent is often ethanol or ethyl acetate, both of which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). The solvent limitations are system and column based. Drawbacks There have been a few technical issues that have limited adoption of SFC technology, first of which is the high pressure operating conditions. High-pressure vessels are expensive and bulky, and special materials are often needed to avoid dissolving gaskets and O-rings in the supercritical fluid. A second drawback is difficulty in maintaining pressure (backpressure regulation). Whereas liquids are nearly incompressible, so their densities are constant regardless of pressure, supercritical fluids are highly compressible and their physical properties change with pressure - such as the pressure drop across a packed- bed column. Currently, automated backpressure regulators can maintain a constant pressure in the column even if flow rate varies, mitigating this problem. A third drawback is difficulty in gas/liquid separation during collection of product. Upon depressurization, the CO2 rapidly turns into gas and aerosolizes any dissolved analyte in the process. Cyclone separators have lessened difficulties in gas/liquid separations.

Emerin, together with LEMD3, is a LEM domain-containing integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane in vertebrates. Emerin is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiac muscle, emerin localizes to adherens junctions within intercalated discs where it appears to function in mechanotransduction of cellular strain and in beta-catenin signaling. Mutations in emerin cause X-linked recessive Emery‚ÄìDreifuss muscular dystrophy, cardiac conduction abnormalities and dilated cardiomyopathy. It is named after Alan Emery.  Structure  Emerin is a 29.0 kDa (34 kDa observed MW) protein composed of 254 amino acids. Emerin is a serine-rich protein with an N-terminal 20-amino acid hydrophobic region that is flanked by charged residues; the hydrophobic region may be important for anchoring the protein to the membrane, with the charged terminal tails being cytosolic. In cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle, emerin localizes to the inner nuclear membrane; expression of emerin is highest in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In cardiac muscle specifically, emerin also resides at adherens junctions within intercalated discs.  Function  Emerin is a serine-rich nuclear membrane protein and a member of the nuclear lamina-associated protein family. It mediates membrane anchorage to the cytoskeleton. Emery‚ÄìDreifuss muscular dystrophy is an X-linked inherited degenerative myopathy resulting from mutation in the EMD (also known clinically as STA) gene. Emerin appears to be involved in mechanotransduction, as emerin-deficient mouse fibroblasts failed to transduce normal mechanosensitive gene expression responses to strain stimuli. In cardiac muscle, emerin is also found complexed to beta-catenin at adherens junctions of intercalated discs, and cardiomyocytes from hearts lacking emerin showed beta-catenin redistribution as well as perturbed intercalated disc architecture and myocyte shape. This interaction appears to be regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta.  Clinical significance  Mutations in emerin cause X-linked recessive Emery‚ÄìDreifuss muscular dystrophy, which is characterized by early contractures in the Achilles tendons, elbows and post-cervical muscles; muscle weakness proximal in the upper limbs and distal in lower limbs; along with cardiac conduction defects that range from sinus bradycardia, PR prolongation to complete heart block. In these patients, immunostaining of emerin is lost in various tissues, including muscle, skin fibroblasts, and leukocytes, however diagnostic protocols involve mutational analysis rather than protein staining. In nearly all cases, mutations result in a complete deletion, or undetectable levels, of emerin protein. Approximately 20% of cases have X chromosomes with an inversion within the Xq28 region. Moreover, recent research have found that the absence of functional emerin may decrease the infectivity of HIV-1. Thus, it is speculated that patients suffering from Emery‚ÄìDreifuss muscular dystrophy may have immunity to or show an irregular infection pattern to HIV-1.  Interactions  Emerin has been shown to interact with: * ACTA1, * ACTG2, * BANF1, * BCLAF1, * CTNNB1, * GMCL1, * LMNA, * PSME1, * SYNE1, * SYNE2, * TMEM43, and * YTHDC1.

In Christian art, this was usually meant to signify that the subject in question had been martyred by beheading. Handling the halo in this circumstance offers a unique challenge for the artist: some put the halo where the head used to be, others have the saint carrying the halo along with the head, and some split the difference. Associated legends often tell of the saint standing and carrying their own head after the beheading. The term \\"cephalophore\\" was first used in a French article by Marcel H√©bert, \\"Les martyrs c√©phalophores Euchaire, Elophe et Libaire\\", in Revue de l'Universit√© de Bruxelles, v. 19 (1914).  Possible origins  The topos can be traced to two sources.As noted by Christopher Walter, The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition, 2003:143. In a homily on Saints Juventinus and Maximinus, John Chrysostom asserted that the severed head of a martyr was more terrifying to the devil than when it was able to speak. \\"He then compared soldiers showing their wounds received in battle to martyrs holding their severed head in their hands and presenting it to Christ\\". The other source was the Western vita of Saint Denis, founder of the see of Paris, who was identified in the text with Dionysius the Areopagite. John the Baptist, the best known beheaded saint, is not considered a cephalophore, since he did not hold his own head in his hands. Saint Denis. Thus, an original, and perhaps the most famous cephalophore is Denis, patron saint of Paris, who, according to the Golden Legend, miraculously preached with his head in his hands while journeying the seven miles from Montmartre to his burying place.In the rational atmosphere of the Enlightenment, Mme du Deffand observed \\"il n'y a que le premier pas qui co√ªte\\", \\"it's only the first step that matters\\"; her mot was repeated in Baron Grimm's Correspondance litt√©raire, 15 May 1764. Although St Denis is the best known of the saintly head-carriers, there were many others; the folklorist √âmile Nourry counted no less than 134 examples of cephalophory in French hagiographic literature alone.Les saints c√©phalophores. √âtude de folklore hagiographique, Revue de l‚ÄôHistoire des Religions (Paris), 99 (1929), p. 158-231. Given the frequency with which relics were stolen in medieval Europe, stories like this, in which a saint clearly indicates their chosen burial site, may have developed as a way of discouraging such acts of furta sacra.\\"Kephalophoroi saints, of whom there were a hundred or so in Western tradition, usually performed this prodigy in order to indicate the emplacement of the shrine where their relics should be venerated\\" (Walter 2003:143).  Examples of cephalophoric saints A cephalophoric legend of Nicasius of Rheims tells that at the moment of his execution, Nicasius was reading Psalm 119 (Psalm 118 in the Vulgate). When he reached the verse \\"Adhaesit pavimento anima mea\\" (\\"My soul is attached unto dust\\") (verse 25), he was decapitated. After his head had fallen to the ground, Nicasius continued the psalm, adding, \\"Vivifica me, Domine, secundum verbum tuum.\\" (\\"Revive me, Lord, with your words\\")San Nicasio di Reims The theme of the speaking head is extended in the 8th-century Passio of Saint Justus of Beauvais: after the child had been beheaded by Roman soldiers, his father and brother found the corpse sitting with his head in his lap. Giving the head to his father, Justus asked him to carry it to Auxerre, that his mother, Felicia, might kiss it.Scott B. Montgomery, \\"Mittite capud meum... ad matrem meam ut osculetur eum: The Form and Meaning of the Reliquary Bust of Saint Just Mittite\\" Gesta 36.1 (1997), pp. 48-64. Saint Aphrodisius, a martyr of Alexandria, venerated at B√©ziers. The legend of Aphrodisius of Alexandria was transferred to B√©ziers, where his name was inserted at the head of the list of bishops. In the hagiographic accounts, Aphrodisius was accompanied by his camel. As he was preaching, a group of pagans pressed through the crowd and beheaded him on the spot. Aphrodisius picked up his head and carried it to the chapel which he had recently consecrated at the site. It is identified today as Place Saint-Aphrodise, B√©ziers.France pittoresque: coutumes et traditions 1908 Saint Gemolo is said to have survived his decapitation and, after collecting his head, climbed on horseback. He rode to meet his uncle, a bishop, on a small mountain before he finally died.Passio di San Gemolo A legend associated with Saint Gin√©s de la Jara states that after he was decapitated in southern France, he picked up his head and threw it into the Rh√¥ne. The head was carried by the sea to the coast of Cartagena in Spain, where it was venerated as a relic (Cartagena was the center of this saint's cult). In The Golden Legend, Paul the Apostle at his martyrdom \\"stretched forth his neck, and so was beheaded. And as soon as the head was from the body, it said: Jesus Christus! which had been to Jesus or Christus, or both, fifty times.\\" When the head was recovered and was to be rejoined to the body as a relic, in response to a prayer for confirmation that this was indeed the right head, the body of Paul turned to rejoin the head that had been set at its feet.The Golden Legend: The Life of Saint Paul the Apostle . In legend, the female saint Osyth stood up after her execution, picking up her head like Saint Denis in Paris and other cephalophoric martyrs, and walking with it in her hands, to the door of a local convent, before collapsing there. Similarly, Valerie of Limoges carried her severed head away to her confessor, Saint Martial. Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne is often depicted with his head on his neck/shoulders and carrying a second head in his hands. However, he is not a cephalophore. The second head is that of Saint Oswald of Northumbria, who was buried with him at Durham Cathedral.  In literature  In Dante's Divine Comedy (Canto 28) the poet meets the spectre of the troubadour Bertrand de Born in the eighth circle of the Inferno, carrying his severed head in his hand, slung by its hair, like a lantern; upon seeing Dante and Virgil, the head begins to speak.\\"E'l capo tronco tenea per le chiome Pesol col mano, a giusa di lanterno: E quei mirava noi, e dicea: \\"O me!\\". Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy, Inferno, Canto 28, 121-123. Longfellow translation, Commentaries from the Dartmouth Dante project. The speaking severed head appears memorably in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The motif Head in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk LiteratureCopenhagen, 1957. reveals how universal is the anomaly of the talking severed head. Aristotle is at pains to discredit the stories of talking heads and to establish the physical impossibility, with the windpipe severed from the lung. \\"Moreover,\\" he adds, \\"among the barbarians, where heads are chopped off with great rapidity, nothing of the kind has ever occurred.\\"Aristotle, De partibus animalium 3.10. Aristotle was doubtless familiar with the story of the singing disembodied head of Orpheus and Homer's image of heads severed so rapidly they seemed still to be speaking,Iliad 10.457, and Odyssey 22.329. and Latin examples could be attested. A link between Latin poets and the Middle Ages in transmitting the trope of the speaking head was noted by Beatrice White,White, \\"A Persistent Paradox\\" Folklore 83.2 (Summer 1972), pp. 122-131) p 123. in the Latin poem on the Trojan War, De Bello Troiano by Joseph of Exeter. Hector whirls in the air the severed head of Patroclus, which whispers \\"Ultor ubi Aeacides\\", \\"Where is Achilles [Aeacides], my avenger?\\" Some modern authors link the legends of cephalophores miraculously walking with their heads in their hands\\"The stories of St. Edmund, St. Kenelm, St. Osyth, and St. Sidwell in England, St. Denis in France, St. Melor and St. Winifred in Celtic territory, preserve the pattern and strengthen the link between legend and folklore,\\" Beatrice White observes. (White 1972:123). to the Celtic cult of heads.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Euronext Dublin under the ticker KMR. Kenmare is one of the world's largest mineral sands producers and the Company owns and operates the Moma Titanium Minerals mine. Moma is one of the world's largest titanium minerals deposits, located 160 km from the city of Nampula in Mozambique, Africa.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 2: Kenmare is the world‚Äôs fourth largest producer of titanium feedstocks (ilmenite and rutile), which are primarily used to make titanium dioxide (Ti02) pigment. Ti02 pigment impart whiteness and opacity in the manufacture of paper, paint and plastics. The Company is responsible for 7% of global supply of titanium feedstocks at current production levels and this is expected to grow to 10% once Kenmare has completed the third of its three growth projects to increase ilmenite production to 1.2 million tonnes per annum (plus associated co- products). History Kenmare was incorporated in Ireland in 1972 under the name Kenmare Oil Exploration Limited. After several years of oil exploration, the Company re-registered as a public limited company under the name Kenmare Oil Exploration Plc on 5 June 1985. On 28 July 1987, the Company changed its name to Kenmare Resources plc and in 1994 it was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange and the main market of the Irish Stock Exchange (now Euronext Dublin). In 1987, the company acquired 50% of the licence for the Congolone heavy mineral sands deposit in Mozambique and during 1989, Kenmare's holding increased to 95%. Separately, the Company operated the Ancuabe graphite mine from 1994 until 1999 when it was placed on care and maintenance due to a fall in graphite prices. Kenmare's drilling of the Congolone deposit resulted in measured mineral resources of 167 million tonnes of ore at grade 3.3% heavy minerals, containing a recoverable 4 million tonnes of ilmenite and associated co-products rutile and zircon. In 1996, BHP became a joint venture partner with Kenmare in the development of the Congolone deposit. Over the coming years, BHP would begin appraising the Namalope, Pillivi and Mualadi deposits and identify new heavy minerals deposits, which would ultimately become the main focus of the mining project. Following the closure of some of BHP's Titanium feedstocks operations, the joint venture agreement was dissolved in 1999 and by 2001 Kenmare had acquired the exclusive rights to the deposit. Work began constructing the mine in October 2004. Production began in 2007 and Kenmare exported its first ilmenite from Moma in December 2007. Commercial production commenced in 2009.https://www.kenmareresources.com/about-us/history A settling pond adjacent to the Moma Mine breached its southern wall on 8 October 2010. A non- toxic discharge of water, sand and clay flowed through the nearby village of Topuito, leaving one 4-year-old child missing. Mining at Moma is undertaken using dredges and floating concentrator plants. Once the minerals are extracted, sand and clay tailings are deposited behind the plants through a series of settling ponds. The accident occurred when a containment wall on one of these settling ponds failed during the early hours of the morning. Mining resumed the following month after some 300 homes had been rebuilt.Questor share tip: Mozambique incident upsets Kenmare Resources Daily Telegraph, 12 October 2010 Kenmare extensively reviewed the berm system, which surrounds the containment ponds and implemented design changes provided by independent engineering firms to prevent any future incidents.Reference KMR press release: 27th October 2010: Update on Moma Mine Incident Operations WCP B at Namalope Kenmare employees at Mineral Separation Plant stockpiles in Mozambique The Company's principal asset is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine, located in Moma, Nampula Province, Mozambique. It has been in production since late 2007.Proactive Investors, 17 March 2010 In 2019 the Mine produced 892,900 tonnes of ilmenite (plus associated co-products) and this is expected to increase to 1.2 million tonnes per annum once the third of the Company‚Äôs three growth projects, the relocation of Wet Concentrator Plant (WCP) B, is complete.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 8 and 9 The mine produces 7% of the world's titanium feedstocks (ilmenite and rutile), which are predominantly used in the production of titanium dioxide pigment favoured for its whiteness and opacity in paper, paint and plastics. The Moma Mine also produces zircon, an important raw material in the manufacture of ceramics and mineral sands concentrates, which is used in various clean technology applications.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 4 and 5 The mine is estimated to have a mine life of over 100 years at current production levels, with over eight billion tonnes of Mineral Resources in various ore zones. The current mine plan extends to beyond 2040.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 10 The Mine has a low environmental impact, with 90% of its power requirement in 2019 sourced from hydropower. No chemicals are used in Moma‚Äôs mining or processing operations and Kenmare employs a progressive rehabilitation strategy in order to return mined land to local communities in a timely manner.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 6 and 53 At the end of 2019, the Mine employed over 1,420 people and 96% were Mozambican. In 2019 the Mine received a five star NOSA accreditation for health, safety and environmental management for the fourth consecutive year.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 22 The total proved and probable ore reserves under the Namalope, Pilivili, and Nataka mining concession are estimated as at 31 December 2019 at 1,584 million tonnes, grading 2.7% ilmenite, 0.18% zircon and 0.060% rutile, containing 43 million tonnes of ilmenite, 2.9 million tonnes of zircon and 0.95 million tonnes of rutile. The total ore resource (excluding reserves) held by the Group under a combination of exploration licences and mining concessions is estimated as at 31 December 2019 at 6.4 billion tonnes, grading 2.4% ilmenite, 0.16% zircon and 0.052% rutile, containing 150 million tonnes of ilmenite, 10 million tonnes of zircon and 3 million tonnes of rutile.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 38 KMAD Community health centre constructed by KMAD In 2004 Kenmare established a not-for-profit development association called the Kenmare Moma Development Association (KMAD). KMAD‚Äôs objective is to implement development projects in the Moma Mine‚Äôs host communities, with the three key focuses of economic development and livelihoods, healthcare development and education development. Since its inception, some of KMAD‚Äôs initiatives have included drilling water boreholes to provide clean drinking water for more than 24,000 people, building over 30 classrooms for local schools, constructing a community health centre including a maternity unit and pharmacy, and building a technical school for vocational development.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 6 and 17 Products The Moma Mine's primary product is ilmenite (accounting for 68% of revenue in 2019), with the associated co-products of primary zircon (22% of revenue), concentrates including mineral sands concentrate (7% of revenue), and rutile (3% of revenue).Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 4 Kenmare is the world‚Äôs fourth largest producer of titanium feedstocks (ilmenite and rutile), which are primarily used to make titanium dioxide (Ti02) pigment. Ti02 pigment impart whiteness and opacity in the manufacture of paper, paint, plastics and multiple other ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô items like inks, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. The Company is responsible for 7% of global supply of titanium feedstocks at current production levels and this is expected to grow to 10% once Kenmare has completed the relocation of WCP B to increase ilmenite production to 1.2 million tonnes per annum (plus associated co-products).Reference: AGM presentation 2020: The Moma Mine also produces zircon, which is an important raw material for the ceramics industry, and mineral sands concentrate, which is used in various clean technology applications. Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks, sediments, and sedimentary rocks in many parts of the world. Apollo astronauts found abundant ilmenite in lunar rocks and the lunar regolith. Ilmenite is a black iron-titanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO3. Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium, a metal needed to make a variety of high- performance alloys. Most of the ilmenite mined worldwide is used to manufacture titanium dioxide, TiO2, an important pigment, whiting, and polishing abrasive.https://geology.com/minerals/ilmenite.shtml Ilmenite is the main source of titanium dioxide, which is used in paints, fabrics, plastics, paper, sunscreen, food and cosmetics. Kenmare produces 7% of the world's titanium feedstocks (ilmenite and rutile). Zircon is a zirconium silicate mineral with a chemical composition of ZrSiO4. It is common throughout the world as a minor constituent of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Zircon is present in most soils and clastic sediments. Zircon-rich sediments are mined and the recovered zircon is used to produce zirconium metal and zirconium dioxide. These are used in a wide variety of manufactured products and industrial processes.https://geology.com/minerals/zircon.shtml Zircon is mainly consumed as an opacifier, and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry. Rutile is a titanium oxide mineral that is most commonly found in granites, pegmatites, and metamorphic rocks. It is also found in sands derived from the weathering of these rocks. Rutile also forms as slender crystals within quartz and micas. It is a common mineral in the alluvial sands that are dredged for magnetite and ilmenite. Rutile is used as a coating on welding rods. It is also used as an ore of titanium, a metal used where light weight and high strength are needed. Some rutile is used in the production of pigments for paints.https://geology.com/minerals/rutile.shtml In Q4 2018 Kenmare introduced a new product stream called mineral sands concentrate, which contains monazite. Monazite is a rare phosphate mineral with a chemical composition of (Ce,La,Nd,Th)(PO4,SiO4). It usually occurs in small isolated grains, as an accessory mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, pegmatite, schist, and gneiss. These grains are resistant to weathering and become concentrated in soils and sediments downslope from the host rock. When in high enough concentrations, they are mined for their rare earth and thorium content. Monazite is an important source of thorium, cerium, and other rare elements. Often mined as a byproduct from heavy mineral deposits. Kenmare despatched its first shipment of mineral sands concentrate from the Moma Mine in Q2 2019.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 64 Markets Kenmare's products are raw materials used in the production of many consumer products. The market for ilmenite, zircon and rutile is a substantial one ‚Äì the titanium feedstocks industry is worth US$4.5 billion per year and the zircon industry is worth US$1.7 billion per year. Demand for Kenmare‚Äôs products is heavily linked to the performance of the global economy. Ti02 pigment is a ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô item and consumption of it grows as income levels increase. Kenmare also expects to benefit from emerging supply constraints. The Company believes that current product prices are not high enough to incentivise new greenfield projects to be built, which means that over time, demand for titanium feedstocks will exceed the available supply. This is expected to support product prices.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 2 and 12 Kenmare's sales profile is geographically diverse with the Company selling its products to customers operating in more than 15 countries globally. In 2019, 58% of the Company‚Äôs revenue was attributable to Asian markets, 27% to European markets and 15% to the rest of the world.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 134 Expansion Plans In August 2018, Kenmare announced three development projects that together have the objective of increasing Moma‚Äôs production to 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite, plus associated co-products, on a sustainable basis. This represents a 35% increase compared to 2019 ilmenite production. The Company says that its development projects will also deliver margin expansion, with Moma‚Äôs largely fixed costs spread over higher production volumes. This will position Kenmare in the first quartile of the industry revenue to cost curve. The first of the three development projects, the WCP B upgrade, was undertaken in 2018. It had the objective of increasing WCP B‚Äôs capacity by 20% from 2,000 tph to 2,400 tph. The project was completed on time and for a capital cost of US$10 million, 35% less than the original budget of US$16 million. The second project was the construction of a third mining plant, named WCP C, and this work was primarily undertaken during 2019. The project budget was US$45 million. WCP C produced its first heavy mineral concentrate, which is then separated into Kenmare‚Äôs four final products, in February 2020. The project experienced some delays due to the late delivery of the concentrator by the contractor, but Kenmare expects WCP C to achieve its nameplate capacity in Q2 2020.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 14 The third project is the relocation of WCP B to the high grade Pilivili ore zone. The move was scheduled to take place in Q3 2020, once WCP B has completed its mine path in Namalope, however in April 2020 Kenmare said the timing is uncertain due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Reference Q1 2020 production update: Prior to the current development programme, the last major expansion decision was taken in 2010. Against the backdrop of a bottleneck in global supply and a very favourable product market, Kenmare announced that it was going to undertake a major expansion of the mine. The goal of the expansion was to raise production by 50%. As the project was being developed, the market cycle turned. The mine briefly suspended operations in June 2015 in the face of industrial action by employees unhappy about the company's cost-cutting measures. Successful negotiation between the union, the Company and the Ministry of Labour had resulted in agreement on somewhat less drastic measures involving fewer layoffs than originally announced. The industrial action was not organized by the union. Operations resumed in early July 2015. By late 2015 the mine had fallen into financial crisis due to a worldwide drop in mineral prices. Flooding in northern Mozambique was also causing power outages in the Moma District region. Prices for titanium ingots fell by about a third between 2012 and 2015. This led Kenmare to undertake a capital raising and restructuring in mid-2016, raising US$275 million and reducing its debt by 74%. As a result, the Company‚Äôs balance sheet was significantly stronger, with a robust cash position and a manageable debt position. Iluka Attempted Takeover In June 2014, following media speculation in Australia, both Iluka and Kenmare Resources announced that Iluka had made an approach to Kenmare, based on a paper transaction, regarding a possible takeover. No formal offer was made, although a number of prices were put forward.https://www.ft.com/content/296fe72a-fd27-11e3-bc93-00144feab7de The process carried on over an extended period, during which Iluka returned with a lower offer. The Iluka approaches failed to attract support from Kenmare's largest shareholder and Iluka ultimately ended the process in December 2015.https://www.irishtimes.com/business/energy-and-resources/kenmare- considers-new-iluka-bid-after-posting-90-7m-net-loss-1.2195692  Oman Investment and Restructuring  As Iluka was announcing its decision to withdraw from takeover talks, Kenmare management announced that the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF) of Oman had indicated an interest in investing $100 million, based on an overall restructuring arrangement being accepted by shareholders.https://www.irishtimes.com/business/energy-and-resources/kenmare- finalises-multimillion-balance-sheet-restructuring-1.2705894 The deal which would ultimately be agreed, saw the SGRF invest $100 million of an overall $275 million refinancing of the Company, which closed in mid-2016. Lenders to the Company agreed to substantially reduce debt.https://ir.euroinvestor.com/Solutions/Kenmare2018tf/3908/newsArticle.aspx?storyid=13419220 The overall impact of the restructuring was to leave the company with a substantially strengthened Balance Sheet, placing the Company on a firm financial footing. Return to Profit and Announcement of Dividend Since the completion of the Mine expansion, production and shipments have risen to record levels. Production in 2017 was just short of 1m tonnes.https://www.irishtimes.com/business/energy-and-resources/kenmare- resources-returns-to-profit-as-production-hits-record-1.3426662 Kenmare reported a return to profit in 2017. Full year profits after tax of $19.4m were reported by the Company. In 2019 Kenmare delivered EBITDA of US$92.6 million and profit after tax of US$44.8 million. On October 16, 2018, Kenmare announced its dividend policy and indicated dividend payments would commence in 2019.https://www.irishtimes.com/business/energy-and-resources/kenmare- announces-maiden-dividend-for-shareholders-1.3665157 The dividend policy committed to pay a minimum of 20% of profits after tax as shareholder returns from 2019, subject to market conditions. In October 2019, Kenmare paid a maiden dividend of USc2.66 per share, which was an interim dividend and based on the Company‚Äôs H1 2019 Results. In May 2020, Kenmare paid a final dividend of USc5.52 per share, resulting in a 2019 full year dividend of USc8.18 per share. This was in line with the dividend policy. Kenmare says that it expects to pay increased shareholder returns following the completion of the WCP B move.Kenmare Resources Annual Report 2019: Published 30th March 2020: Page 11 References External links *Official site Category:Companies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Companies of Mozambique Category:Titanium ","title":"Kenmare Resources"},{"id":"7702685","text":"Burcher is a small rural village situated in central New South Wales, Australia, in Lachlan Shire.

It is listed on CITES Appendix II, restricting trade in wild-caught birds to preserve its stocks.BLI (2008) Systematics Three subspecies are recognized today as good, while an additional one is of unclear validity: * P. b. bicalcaratum Linnaeus, 1758 - Common grey peacock-pheasant * P. b. ghigii Delacour & Jabouille, 1924 - Ghigi's grey peacock-pheasant * P. b. bailyi Lowe, 1925 - Lowe's grey peacock-pheasant (disputed) * P. b. bakeri Lowe, 1925 - Northern grey peacock-pheasant One previous subspecies, the Hainan peacock- pheasant (P. b. katsumatae), has since been given approved species (AS) status by the IOC. Lowe's grey peacock-pheasant was described from a captive bird of unknown provenance.Lowe (1924) Similar examples have turned up on occasion, but the validity and - if distinct - home range of this taxon remains unknown. It was theorized to inhabit western Assam or the eastern Himalayas, but this is based on conjecture. The phylogeny of this species is fairly enigmatic. mtDNA cytochrome b and D-loop as well as the nuclear ovomucoid intron G sequence data confirms that it belongs to a largely Continental Asian clade together with Germain's peacock-pheasant (P. germaini), but also the \\"brown\\" southern species bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant (P. chalcurum) and mountain peacock-pheasant (P. inopinatum).Kimball et al. (2001) The ovomucin sequence seems to have evolved convergently or with a decreased mutational rate on the grey and the bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant. Though they are quite similar on the molecular level, the distance and interspersed populations of their closest relatives argue against a much more recently shared common ancestry between them versus the other two \\"northern\\" peacock-pheasants. Also, the cytochrome b and D-loop data does not support a closer relationship between P. bicalcaratus and P. chalcurum; overall, as it seems the four species' ancestors separated during a very short timespan. Note however that in the absence of dedicated phylogeographic studies, the molecular data is only of limited value in this species, the most morphologically diverse and widespread peacock-pheasant: There is no data on the origin and number of specimens, but it is unlikely that more than one or two individuals - possibly of captive origin and undeterminable subspecific allocation - were sampled. All that can be reasonably assumed is that the grey peacock-pheasant evolved on mainland Southeast Asia, probably during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene 3.6-1 million years ago.Kimball et al. (2001); note that the uncalibrated molecular clock method used here is an outdated technique. The presumed 2% mutation rate is appropriate for small short-lived Neoaves, but probably not for larger and more ancestral birds like Galliformes.

The Privy CouncilNote: The Privy Council is an English court that, at the time of this case, was the final appeal court of Australia held that a party can be held liable only for loss that was reasonably foreseeable. Contributory negligence on the part of the dock owners was also relevant in the decision, and was essential to the outcome, although not central to this case's legal significance. The Wagon Mound (No 1) should not be confused with the successor case of the Overseas Tankship v Miller Steamship or \\"Wagon Mound (No 2)\\", which concerned the standard of the reasonable man in breach of the duty of care.. Facts Overseas Tankship had a ship, the Wagon Mound, docked in Sydney Harbour in October 1951. The crew had carelessly allowed furnace oil (also referred to as Bunker oil) to leak from their ship. The oil drifted under a wharf thickly coating the water and the shore where other ships were being repaired. Hot metal produced by welders using oxyacetylene torches on the respondent's timber wharf (Mort's Dock) at Sheerlegs Wharf fell on floating cotton waste which ignited the oil on the water. The wharf and ships moored there sustained substantial fire damage. In an action by Mort's Dock for damages for negligence it was found as a fact that the defendants did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the oil was capable of being set alight when spread on water. The dock owners knew the oil was there, and continued to use welders. The leading case on proximate cause was Re Polemis,Re Polemis & Furness, Withy & Co Ltd [1921] 3 KB 560. which held that a defendant can be deemed liable for all consequences flowing from his negligent conduct regardless of how unforeseeable such consequences are. As this case was binding in Australia, its rule was followed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal.Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock & Engineering Co (1959) 61 SR (NSW) 688 (3 December 1959), Court of Appeal (NSW, Australia). The defendant appealed to the Privy Council. Judgment Former site of Mort's Dock, Balmain, New South Wales. The Privy Council found in favour of the defendant, agreeing with the expert witness who provided evidence that the defendant, in spite of the furnace oil being innately flammable, could not reasonably expect it to burn on water. The Board indicated Morts would probably have been successful if they had claimed damages for direct damage by the oil to the slipway but this was minor and not part of the damages claimed (although success on this count may have saved Morts Dock and Engineering the costs of all the litigation for both parties across all three levels of court). Viscount Simonds, in his delivery for the Privy Council, said that the Counsel for Morts had discredited their own position by arguing that it couldn't have been bunkering oil because it wouldn't burn on water. The Privy Council's advice soundly disapproved the rule established in Re Polemis, as being \\"out of the current of contemporary thought\\" and held that to find a party liable for negligence the damage must be reasonably foreseeable. The council found that even though the crew were careless and breached their duty of care, the resulting extensive damage by fire was not foreseeable by a reasonable person, although the minor damage of oil on metal on the slipway would have been foreseeable. Viscount Simonds delivered the judgment of the Board and said: > It is, no doubt, proper when considering tortious liability for negligence > to analyse its elements and to say that the plaintiff must prove a duty owed > to him by the defendant, a breach of that duty by the defendant, and > consequent damage. But there can be no liability until the damage has been > done. It is not the act but the consequences on which tortious liability is > founded. ... Who knows or can be assumed to know all the processes of > nature? But if it would be wrong that a man should be held liable for damage > unpredictable by a reasonable man because it was \\"direct\\" or \\"natural,\\" > equally it would be wrong that he should escape liability, however > \\"indirect\\" the damage, if he foresaw or could reasonably foresee the > intervening events which led to its being done. > It is a principle of civil liability, subject only to qualifications which > have no present relevance, that a man must be considered to be responsible > for the probable consequences of his act. To demand more of him is too harsh > a rule, to demand less is to ignore that civilised order requires the > observance of a minimum standard of behaviour. Significance Up until this time the leading case had been Re Polemis, where the central question was that of the directness of the chain of events between the triggering act being examined for negligence and the result. The Council decided that rather than go with precedent (authority) they would determine a principle from a range of cases, in a similar way as Lord Atkin did in Donoghue v Stevenson, and their principle was primarily a single test for foreseeability which they argued was a logical link between the damage and the liability (culpability). Stated differently, foreseeability was the logical link between, and the test for, breach of the duty of care and the damages. This is the supreme test, and may be rephrased as \\"the liability of a consequence ... was natural or necessary or probable.\\" The Lords made reference to hindsight, indicating it is nothing like foresight and should play no role in assessing negligence. There is authority to challenge this view of hindsight; in Page v Smith, Lord Lloyd stated: \\"In the case of secondary victims, i.e. persons who were not participants in an accident, the defendant will not be liable unless psychiatric injury is foreseeable in a person of normal fortitude and it may be legitimate to use hindsight in order to be able to apply the test of reasonable foreseeability.\\"Page v Smith [1995] 2 All ER 736 (p 767 j, post) The Lords gave Morts the opportunity to sue in nuisance but there is no record of them testing this action in that tort. The common law rules of causation have had their importance lessened by the promulgation of statute law in Australia. Contributory negligence is now essential for many determinations and are covered by statutes such as the Civil Liability Act (1936) South Australia which has more recent counterparts in a number of jurisdictions including New South Wales.

CCAF serves approximately 300,000 active, guard, and reserve enlisted personnel, making CCAF the world's largest community college system. The college awards over 22,000 associate in applied science degrees from 71 degree programs annually.https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Barnes/CCAF/ The CCAF is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools through Air University. History In the early 1970s, the Air Force decided to attempt to gain accreditation and recognition for Air Force training programs. Representatives of the Air Training Command (ATC), Air University, and the United States Air Force Academy held numerous conferences in 1971 to discuss increased training for Air Force non-commissioned officers (NCOs). These conferences, in turn, recommended the foundation of an Air Force community college. On 9 November 1971, Gen John D. Ryan, Air Force Chief of Staff, approved the establishment of the Community College of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force approved the plan 25 January 1972, and the college was officially established on 1 April 1972, at Randolph AFB, TX.USAF Air University: Community College of the Air Force General Information Until the mid-1970s, the CCAF offered only certificate programs. It became apparent that CCAF standards exceeded the minimum requirements of associate degree programs in civilian community colleges. Therefore, in 1975 the Air Force sought degree-granting authority for the college from Congress. President Gerald R. Ford signed Public Law 94-361 on 14 July 1976 authorizing the AETC commander to confer the associate degree. Search Results ‚Äì THOMAS (Library of Congress) Following an evaluation in October 1976, the U.S. Commissioner of Education certified degree-granting authority in January 1977. The college awarded its first AAS degree in April 1977.USAF Air University: Community College of the Air Force General Information When the Commission on Occupational Education Institution charter was limited in 1975 to non-degree-granting institutions, the CCAF began seeking accreditation from the SACS Commission on Colleges. The Commission on Colleges accredited the CCAF on 12 December 1980. In 2004, Air University became accredited by the SACS Commission on Colleges to award associate and master's degrees. CCAF now shares in Air University's regional accreditation. CCAF was separately accredited by SACS from 1980 to 2004.USAF Air University: Community College of the Air Force General Information Currently the CCAF is only open to airmen, but Congressman Sestak added language to the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act to open admission to all branches.Congressman Sestak's Amendments in National Defense Authorization Act Pass House Academics The program combines the technical education offered by Air Force schools with a core of general education from regionally accredited civilian institutions, and management education from Air Force or civilian sources. The CCAF offers Associates of Applied Science degrees in five broad career areas:USAF Air University: Community College of the Air Force *Aircraft and Missile Maintenance *Allied Health *Electronics and Telecommunications *Logistics and Resources *Public and Support Services Within those 5 broad areas, the CCAF currently offers 67 specific degree programs.2005‚Äì2007 Degree Programs AU-ABC program In June 2007 Air University announced a new program where four-year colleges accept the entire value (60 credits) of the CCAF Associate degree towards a bachelor's degree, requiring only 60 more credits (typically upper division, core classes). This program is called the Air University Associate-To-Baccalaureate Cooperative. It has been publicized as a convenient way for an Airman to complete their 4-year degree. It has also served to boost the desirability of a CCAF degree, as there is a notion among the enlisted members that a CCAF Associate degree only holds value in the Air Force community. As of October 2009 the AU-ABC program included 42 civilian colleges and universities offering 209 bachelor's degree programs. Thirty-six of the ABC schools hold regional accreditation, and six hold national accreditation through the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (formerly the Distance Education and Training Council).

During World War II, Bob flew approximately 700 combat missions, and claimed 60 victories; 37 of which were on the Eastern Front. Early Luftwaffe Bob joined the Luftwaffe in 1936,Ries and Obermaier 1991 at the rank of a Fahnenjunker (officer candidate), and began his flight training on 1 June 1937. World War II In 1939, prior to the Invasion of Poland, Bob was transferred to the newly formed 3./Jagdgeschwader 21 (JG 21) (later known as the \\"Devils Squadron\\"),For an explanation of the meaning of Luftwaffe unit designation see Luftwaffe Organization which was redesignated on 6 June 1940 into 9./Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54). It was equipped with the Bf 109 fighter, an aircraft Bob would become very familiar with over the years ‚Äì flying every model except the Kurf√ºrst. During the French campaign on 10 May 1940, Bob claimed his first victory when he shot down a Gloster Gladiator over Tongeren in Belgium. That August, he was promoted to the rank of Oberleutnant. On 10 October 1940, he was appointed Staffelkapit√§n of 7./JG 54 for a short period; he was soon appointed Staffelkapit√§n of 9./JG 54. During the Battle of Britain, 9./JG 54 was activated as a Jabo unit, targeting shipping vessels. By November 1940, Bob had recorded 19 kills, and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) by Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring on 7 March 1941. On 21 March 1941, Bob survived, unhurt, a ditching into Cherbourg harbour with his B√º 131 training aircraft, which had suffered engine failure. After the Battle of Britain, he participated in the Balkan campaign, where he recorded his 20th and 21st victories. JG 54 was re- equipped with the new Bf 109 F and relocated to airfields in Prussia, in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia. On 23 June 1941, Hans Ekkehard Bob recorded his first victory in Russian airspace ‚Äì a Tupolev SB twin-engined bomber. During this combat, his Bf 109 F-2 was hit by return fire, resulting in a forced landing behind enemy lines. He evaded capture and returned to his unit two days later. Between 13 July and 30 October 1941, Bob made three more emergency landings due to aircraft combat damage behind enemy lines, but in each case returned to his unit. On 29 September 1942, Bob had his 50th victory, and was promoted to Hauptmann later that year. Flying on the Eastern Front ended for Hans Ekkehard Bob and III./JG 54 in February 1943, after he received orders from General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland to change positions with elements of the then French-based JG 26. This order was later cancelled, but III. Gruppe stayed on the Western Front, separated from the rest of the 'Greenhearts', serving initially in northern Germany with Jagdgeschwader 1. On 17 April 1943, Bob recorded his 57th victory; the ramming of a USAAF Boeing B-17 bomber near Bremen with his Bf 109 G-6. He bailed out and survived the crash without injury. On 1 August, Bob was promoted to the rank of Major and was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of IV./JG 54. He returned to the Eastern Front, where he scored a further two victories. By May 1944, Bob was back at the Western Front as Gruppenkommandeur of II./Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3), based in the Normandy invasion front corridor, flying Reichsverteidigung (Defense of the Reich) duties. In August, he was transferred to Erprobungskommando 262 where he learned to fly the Messerschmitt Me 262. In early 1945, his experience led to his becoming a member of General der Flieger Josef Kammhuber's staff. Bob was responsible for allocating newly built Me 262's to operational units. Later, he took command of I. and II./EJG 2 and was responsible for practice and training former bomber pilots in flying the Me 262. Bob was one of the aces chosen to fly as a member of the jet fighter unit JV 44, led by Adolf Galland. In the final days of World War II, Bob was responsible for building a longer runway at Innsbruck airfield for the Me 262 jets. At the capitulation on 8 May 1945, Bob was in Kappl, a small village near Salzburg. From Kappl, he walked more than in six weeks to return to his home in Celle. After the war Bob returned to civilian life working as a farm labourer. In 1946, he founded his own transport company. Around this time, he met Waldemar W√ºbke, an old JV 44 comrade, and a friend from his time in JG 54. Bob always told W√ºbke's history with a smile on his face. W√ºbke still wore his old uniform and officer cap as he was questioned by a British officer. \\"Why are you wearing this old stuff?\\" W√ºbke replied, \\"Do I ask you if your grandma has hemorrhoids?\\" He never met W√ºbke again, and W√ºbke later died in the early 1950s in Argentina, the result of injuries sustained in an airliner crash. In 1956, Bob established the Celle Flying Club. From 30 September to 1 October 2000, Bob also was among the historical figures at the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Santa Monica, California. Bob had been married to his wife Christa for over 50 years. They had three children: Roland, Elmar and Delia. He also had three other children with his first wife. He died on 12 August 2013.http://en.ww2awards.com/person/28508 Awards * Iron Cross (1939) ** 2nd Class (17 September 1939) ** 1st Class * Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe (28 September 1940)Obermaier 1989, p. 90. * German Cross in Gold on 24 December 1942 as Oberleutnant in the 9./Jagdgeschwader 54 * Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 7 March 1941 as Oberleutnant and Staffelkapit√§n of the 9./Jagdgeschwader 54 Notes References =Citations= =Bibliography= Bob, Hans-Ekkehard (2003).

In contrast, in conventional routing, routers in the network determine the path incrementally based on the packet's destination. Another routing alternative, label switching, is used in connection-oriented networks such as X.25, Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode and Multiprotocol Label Switching. Source routing allows easier troubleshooting, improved traceroute, and enables a node to discover all the possible routes to a host. It does not allow a source to directly manage network performance by forcing packets to travel over one path to prevent congestion on another. Many high-performance interconnects including Myrinet, Quadrics, IEEE 1355, and SpaceWire support source routing. Internet Protocol In the Internet Protocol, two header options are available which are rarely used: \\"strict source and record route\\" (SSRR) and \\"loose source and record route\\" (LSRR). Because of security concerns, packets marked LSRR are frequently blocked on the Internet. If not blocked, LSRR can allow an attacker to spoof an address but still successfully receive response packets by forcing return traffic for spoofed packets to return through the attacker's device. In IPv6, two forms of source routing have been developed. The first approach was the Type 0 Routing header. This routing header was designed to support the same use cases as the IPv4 header options. Unfortunately there were several significant attacks against this routing header and its utilisation was deprecated. A more secure form of source routing is being developed within the IETF to support the IPv6 version of Segment Routing. Software-defined networking Software-defined networking can also be enhanced when source routing is used in the forwarding plane. Studies have shown significant improvements in convergence times as a result of the reduced state that must be distributed by the controller into the network. Myrinet When using source routing with Myrinet, the sender of the packet prepends the complete route, one byte for every crossbar, to each packet header. Each crossbar examines the first routing byte of the packet. When using source routing, that byte indicates a particular port of that crossbar; when that port becomes available, the router discards that routing byte and sends the rest of the packet out that port. SpaceWire Each packet traveling through a SpaceWire network can use path addressing (source routing) or logical addressing or some combination. The router examines the first data character of the packet; when it indicates some specific port of the router, the router discards that routing character and sends the rest of the packet out that port.

It was an alternative to the SRBs. The addition of wings (and some form of landing gear) on the S-IC stage would allow the booster to fly back to the Kennedy Space Center, where technicians would then refurbish the booster (by replacing only the five F-1 engines and reusing the tanks and other hardware for later flights). The Shuttle would handle space station logistics, while Saturn V would launch components. This would have allowed a space station, using a Skylab or Mir configuration with docking ports, to have been lifted with just a handful of launches.

Its campus is located at 1640 New High Shoals Road in Watkinsville, Oconee County, Georgia, United States.  History  Westminster Christian Academy was founded in the fall of 1989. The school's initial class was composed of 10 first, second, and third grade students meeting in rented space at Faith Presbyterian Church in Watkinsville, taught by Karen Schaefer. The school grew alongside the oldest students in this first class, adding a new grade level after each school year.Founding Principles section of WCA official website. Last accessed April 10, 2012. In 1994, enrollment in the school outgrew the capacity of its facilities at Faith Presbyterian. As a result, the school's lower grades (K-4) remained at Faith, and the higher grades (5-8, the highest grade offered at the time) moved to facilities at Watkinsville First Baptist Church. WCA's first high school class graduated in the spring of 1999. The school completed the first phase of development at its present location, a site in Oconee County, in the fall of 1998. An additional expansion was planned that would add a new gymnasium and bring the school's capacity to 500 students.In 2018, another expansion was and is still planned to make new 6-12th grade classrooms that make the capacity of the school to 750.  Academics  The school enrolled 365 students across all grades for the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year. WCA's facilities include an administration building, which also houses the library; a lower-school building, which houses Pre-K through fifth grade; an upper-school building with a gymnasium and a fitness center, which houses the middle grades and Westminster High School; a field house containing two class rooms; and three athletic fields.

The station also carries West Virginia University basketball and Richwood High School sports. While it simulcasts sister station WSGB full-time, WVAR breaks away for sports broadcasts. History =As WMNF= WVAR first went on the air on November 16, 1957, and first broadcast at 1280 AM under the call letters WMNF. The original owner was Royal Broadcasting Company, of which Herman Dotson served as president and Art Grunewald as general manager. Studios were located along Cemetery Road in Richwood. By 1959, the call letters were changed to WVAR, as they remain today. =As WVAR= On January 1, 1965, WVAR was sold to R & S Broadcasting. Carl Gainer was the new company president, and Virgil Graves became General Manager. In 1968, WVAR moved from its dial position of 1280 kHz to 600 kHz. The station retained its daytime-only broadcast hours and output power of 1,000 watts. In 1991, WVAR moved its studios and offices to 713 Main Street in Summersville, but would maintain a local presence in Richwood at 2 Rhododendron Drive, formerly known as Cemetery Road. On December 24, 1996, after more than 30 years of ownership, WVAR was sold by R & S Broadcasting to J & K Broadcasting. The ownership change also resulted in the pairing of an FM sister station, WAFD, which had gone on the air earlier that year with a southern and country gospel format. In mid-February 2003, an ice storm that ravaged the southern part of West Virginia toppled the WVAR broadcasting antenna atop Hinkle Mountain which overlooks Richwood. In the following summer the station and its owner raised funds to erect a new antenna. The station was closed with a dark license while funds were sought to replace it. On March 13, 2007, J & K Broadcasting, Inc. sold WVAR to Summit Media Broadcasting, LLC for $1.24 million in a transaction that included sister FM station WAFD in Webster Springs. Summit Media also owns WDBS-FM and WSGB-AM. Studios were moved to 202 Back Fork Street in Webster Springs. On May 15, 2007, WVAR dropped its country format and began simulcasting sister WSGB-AM's oldies format as \\"The Mighty 1490\\". That October, Summit Media filed an application with the FCC to waive main studio requirements for WVAR, which would allow on-air operations to be co-located with WSGB and other stations in Summit Media's ownership group. Two months later, another application was filed informing the FCC that Summit Media had taken the station silent due to Summit Media's inability to successfully meet FCC-required staffing needs at the Webster Springs studio. The FCC granted the application to keep the station silent in January 2008 until granting permission for the studio waiver later that year. However, Summit Media kept the station silent for another year due to technical renovations being delayed due to the lack of available workforce. =Translator= In November 2009, Summit Media filed an application to rebroadcast WVAR's signal over FM translator W251AY, licensed to Birch River. The translator, licensed to operate at 98.1 mHz, broadcasts at 250 watts at a height of 256 m above average terrain. The translator, which has been on the air since 2004, had been previously used to rebroadcast the signal of sister FM station WDBS.

The earliest extant manuscript containing Johann Sebastian Bach's solo keyboard arrangement of the concerto, BWV 974, dates from around 1715. As a concerto for oboe, strings and continuo its oldest extant sources date from 1717: that year it was printed in Amsterdam, and a C minor variant of the concerto, S Z799, was written down. Bach's keyboard version was published as an arrangement of a concerto by Antonio Vivaldi in the 19th century. In 1923 the C minor version of the oboe concerto was published as a composition by Benedetto Marcello, Alessandro's brother. In the second half of the 20th century several publications indicated Alessandro again as the composer of the piece, as it had been in its early 18th-century print, and the oboe concerto was again published in its D minor version. In the 20th and 21st centuries the concerto developed into a well-established repertoire piece, as well as an oboe concerto as performed on keyboard.Alessandro Marcello: Concerto for Oboe and String Orchestra and Concerto in D minor after Alessandro Marcello, BWV 974 at ArkivMusic website. History The Concerto in D minor, S D935, was published by Jeanne Roger in Amsterdam in 1717, as a Concerto a Cinque (concerto in five parts) for oboe (soloist), strings (two violin and one viola parts) and continuo composed by Alessandro Marcello.Jones 2006, pp. 143‚Äì144Rasch 2005, p. 72(score publication) Amsterdam [1717] No publication date appears in the print: although the year of publication is, depending on author, sometimes given as \\"ca. 1714-1717\\"Scarnati 1996 or \\"1716\\"Schulenberg 2013, p. 130 and endnotes p. 462 it can be inferred from the consecutive testaments of the publisher's father (Estienne Roger) and from the sequence of publication numbers.Rasch 2005 The publication presents the melody lines unadorned, that is: it is left to the performing musician to embellish melodies with ornaments such as trills, mordents and grace notes.Scarnati 1996, pp. 12‚Äì13 Alessandro Marcello published most of his works under a pseudonym (Eterio Stinfalico): the oboe concerto publication was an exception in that sense as it used his real name.Scarnati 1996, pp. 16‚Äì17 In his Weimar period (1708‚Äì17) Johann Sebastian Bach arranged several concertos by Venetian composers, most of them by Antonio Vivaldi, for solo keyboard, known as his Weimar concerto transcriptions. In July 1713 Prince Johann Ernst returned to Weimar from the Netherlands with several compositions by Italian masters. Vivaldi's Op. 3, L'estro Armonico had been published in Amsterdam in 1711, and there is little doubt that the Prince brought this edition, containing twelve concertos, to Weimar in 1713, as Bach apparently used this print for five of his solo keyboard arrangements. The Prince, who also composed Italianate concertos, presumably encouraged Bach to produce solo keyboard arrangements of such works. As the Prince left Weimar in July 1714 it is estimated that most of Bach's solo keyboard arrangements of Italian and Italianate concertos originated in the period from July 1713 to July 1714. That is, at least those arrangements that could be performed on a harpsichord without pedalboard, while the Weimar court organ (which would be needed for arrangements including pedals such as BWV 592‚Äì597) would have been unavailable for undergoing repairs in this period. Bach's manualiter arrangement, BWV 974, of the Marcello concerto was apparently not based on the Amsterdam edition, but must have been based on a (lost) manuscript version of the concerto that circulated before it was printed. The July 1713 to July 1714 timeframe may fit for the production of the arrangement of this concerto, although an earlier or later date is possible too. Bach's autograph of the solo keyboard arrangement is lost, but the arrangement was copied around 1715 by Bach's second cousin Johann Bernhard, as the third item in a manuscript containing 12 of Johann Sebastian's keyboard transcriptions of Italian and Italianate concertos. In 1739 Johann Bernhard's son Johann Ernst wrote a title page for this collection, suggesting that the collection contained Vivaldi arrangements for organ exclusively. He may have intended this title page for the first concerto in the collection only (which was indeed an arrangement of a Vivaldi concerto), but an unknown hand later added the number \\"XII\\" before the title, thus causing the misunderstanding that all 12 were Vivaldi arrangements.(manuscript) D-B Mus. ms. Bach P 280 (3) Another copy of Bach's arrangement indicates \\"Marcello\\" (without first name) as the composer of the original work, and J. S. Bach as the arranger. That copy, specifying harpsichord as the intended instrument for the arrangement, originated after Johann Bernhard's, but may have been copied from an earlier stage of Bach's arrangement.(manuscript) D-DS Mus. ms. 66 Another manuscript containing Bach's arrangement of Marcello's oboe concerto indicated \\"J. S. B.\\" as composer on the title page, without mentioning an earlier model, or its composer, for the composition.(manuscript) D-B Mus. ms. Bach P 804, Fascicle 4 Wilhelm Friedemann The ornamentation as indicated in Bach's keyboard version of the concerto works well on harpsichord, but is less suitable for performance on an early 18th-century oboe. Nonetheless Bach's ornamentation has been used for 20th-century publications of the oboe concerto ‚Äì the ornamentation causes fewer problems when performed on a modern oboe. Editions of the D minor version of the oboe concerto with an ornamentation which is better in line with the possibilities of a baroque oboe have been proposed since the late 20th century.Scarnati 1996, pp. 99‚Äì111(score publication) Voxman 1977 Another transcription of the concerto, as concerto a 5 for oboe, strings and continuo in C minor, is found in a 1717 manuscript. The type of errors in this manuscript seems to suggest that the transposition from D minor to C minor may have been produced by its scribes while copying. This manuscript writes the composer's name as \\"Marcello\\" without specifying a first name: as Alessandro's brother Benedetto was far better known as a composer by the name Marcello, later generations would interpret the title of the manuscript as referring to the better known of the \\"Marcello\\" composers.(manuscript) SW Mus. Ms. 3530 Movements The piece has three movements: # Andante spiccato # Adagio # Presto The concerto survives in different printed and manuscript versions, one of these in C minor. Other versions The concerto has also been recorded played on a piccolo trumpet - a notoriously challenging transcription due to the breath control and tight embouchure required for its sustained passages in the higher register.

It is named for Russian physicists Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm who developed the theory of the Cherenkov effect in 1937, for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958. When a charged particle moves faster than the phase speed of light in a medium, electrons interacting with the particle can emit coherent photons while conserving energy and momentum. This process can be viewed as a decay. See Cherenkov radiation and nonradiation condition for an explanation of this effect. Equation The energy dE emitted per unit length travelled by the particle per unit of frequency d\\\\omega is: :\\\\frac{d^2E}{dx \\\\, d\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{q^2}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\mu(\\\\omega) \\\\omega {\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{c^2} {v^2 n^2(\\\\omega)}\\\\right)} provided that \\\\beta = \\\\frac{v}{c} > \\\\frac{1}{n(\\\\omega)}. Here \\\\mu(\\\\omega) and n(\\\\omega) are the frequency-dependent permeability and index of refraction of the medium respectively, q is the electric charge of the particle, v is the speed of the particle, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. Cherenkov radiation does not have characteristic spectral peaks, as typical for fluorescence or emission spectra. The relative intensity of one frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) are more intense in Cherenkov radiation. This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue. In fact, most Cherenkov radiation is in the ultraviolet spectrum; the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green, and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum. The total amount of energy radiated per unit length is: :\\\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\\\frac{q^2}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\int_{v > \\\\frac{c}{n(\\\\omega)}} \\\\mu(\\\\omega) \\\\omega {\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{c^2} {v^2 n^2(\\\\omega)}\\\\right)} d\\\\omega This integral is done over the frequencies \\\\omega for which the particle's speed v is greater than speed of light of the media \\\\frac{c}{n(\\\\omega)}. The integral is convergent (finite) because at high frequencies the refractive index becomes less than unity and for extremely high frequencies it becomes unity.The refractive index n is defined as the ratio of the speed of electromagnetic radiation in vacuum and the phase speed of electromagnetic waves in a medium and can, under specific circumstances, become less than one. See refractive index for further information.The refractive index can become less than unity near the resonance frequency but at extremely high frequencies the refractive index becomes unity.  Derivation of Frank‚ÄìTamm formula  Consider a charged particle moving relativistically along x-axis in a medium with refraction index n(\\\\omega) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} For simplicity we consider magnetic permeability \\\\mu(\\\\omega) = 1. with a constant velocity \\\\vec v = (v,0,0) . Start with Maxwell's equations (in Gaussian units) in the wave forms (also known as the Lorenz gauge condition) and take the Fourier transformation: \\\\bigg ( k^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c^2} \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) \\\\bigg) \\\\Phi(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{ 4 \\\\pi}{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} \\\\rho(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega) \\\\bigg ( k^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c^2} \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) \\\\bigg) \\\\vec A(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{ 4 \\\\pi}{c} \\\\vec J(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega) For a charge of magnitude ze (where e is the elementary charge) moving with velocity v, the density and charge density can be expressed as \\\\rho(\\\\vec x, t) = z e \\\\delta(\\\\vec x - \\\\vec v t) and \\\\vec J(\\\\vec x,t) = \\\\vec v \\\\rho(\\\\vec x,t), taking the Fourier transformation We use 'engineer' notation for the Fourier transform, where 1/\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi} factors appear both in direct and inverse transforms. gives: \\\\rho(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega) = \\\\frac{ z e}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\vec k \\\\cdot \\\\vec v) \\\\vec J(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega) = \\\\vec v \\\\rho (\\\\vec k ,\\\\omega) Substituting this density and charge current into the wave equation, we can solve for the Fourier-form potentials: \\\\Phi(\\\\vec k, \\\\omega) = \\\\frac{2 z e}{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} \\\\frac{ \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\vec k \\\\cdot \\\\vec v)}{k^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c^2} \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} and \\\\vec A(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) = \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) \\\\frac{\\\\vec v}{c} \\\\Phi(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) Using the definition of the electromagnetic fields in terms of potentials, we then have the Fourier- form of the electric and magnetic field: \\\\vec E(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) = i \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{\\\\omega \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)}{c} \\\\frac{\\\\vec v}{c} - \\\\vec k \\\\bigg) \\\\Phi(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) and \\\\vec B(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) = i \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) \\\\vec k \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\vec v}{c} \\\\Phi(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) To find the radiated energy, we consider electric field as a function of frequency at some perpendicular distance from the particle trajectory, say, at (0,b,0), where b is the impact parameter. It is given by the inverse Fourier transform: \\\\vec E(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{ ( 2 \\\\pi)^{3/2}} \\\\int d^3k \\\\vec E(\\\\vec k,\\\\omega) e^{i bk_2} First we compute x-component E_1 of the electric field (parallel to \\\\vec v): E_1(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{2 i z e}{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) ( 2\\\\pi)^{3/2}} \\\\int d^3k e^{i bk_2} \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{ \\\\omega \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) v}{c^2} - k_1 \\\\bigg ) \\\\frac{\\\\delta(\\\\omega - v k_1)}{k^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c^2} \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} For brevity we define \\\\lambda^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{v^2} - \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c^2} \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{v^2} \\\\big ( 1 - \\\\beta^2 \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) \\\\big ). Breaking the integral apart into k_1, k_2, k_3, the k_1 integral can immediately be integrated by the definition of the Dirac Delta: E_1(\\\\omega) = - \\\\frac{2 i z e \\\\omega}{v^2 ( 2\\\\pi)^{3/2}} \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} - \\\\beta^2 \\\\bigg) \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} dk_2 e^{i bk_2} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{dk_3}{k_2^2 + k_3^2 + \\\\lambda^2} The integral over k_3 has the value \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{ (\\\\lambda^2 + k^2_2)^{1/2}}, giving: E_1(\\\\omega) = - \\\\frac{ i z e \\\\omega}{v^2 \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} - \\\\beta^2 \\\\bigg) \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} dk_2 \\\\frac{e^{i bk_2}}{(\\\\lambda^2 + k_2^2)^{1/2}} The last integral over k_2 is in the form of a modified (Macdonald) Bessel function, giving the evaluated parallel component in the form: E_1(\\\\omega) = - \\\\frac{i z e \\\\omega}{v^2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} - \\\\beta^2 \\\\bigg) K_0(\\\\lambda b) One can follow a similar pattern of calculation for the other fields components arriving at: E_2(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{z e}{v} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} K_1(\\\\lambda b), \\\\quad E_3 = 0 \\\\quad and \\\\quad B_1 = B_2 = 0, \\\\quad B_3(\\\\omega) = \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) \\\\beta E_2(\\\\omega) We can now consider the radiated energy dE per particle traversed distance dx_{\\\\text{particle}} . It can be expressed through the electromagnetic energy flow P_a through the surface of an infinite cylinder of radius a around the path of the moving particle, which is given by the integral of the Poynting vector \\\\mathbf S = c / (4 \\\\pi) [ \\\\mathbf E \\\\times \\\\mathbf H] over the cylinder surface: \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{dE}{dx_{\\\\text{particle}}} \\\\bigg)_{\\\\text{rad}} = \\\\frac{1}{v} P_a = - \\\\frac{c}{4 \\\\pi v} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} 2 \\\\pi a B_3 E_1 dx The integral over dx at one instant of time is equal to the integral at one point over all time. Using dx = v dt: \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{dE}{dx_{\\\\text{particle}}} \\\\bigg)_{\\\\text{rad}} = - \\\\frac{c a }{2} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} B_3(t) E_1(t) dt Converting this to the frequency domain: \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{dE}{dx_{\\\\text{particle}}} \\\\bigg)_{\\\\text{rad}} = -c a \\\\, \\\\text{Re} \\\\bigg( \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} B_3^*(\\\\omega) E_1(\\\\omega) d\\\\omega \\\\bigg) To go into the domain of Cherenkov radiation, we now consider perpendicular distance b much greater than atomic distances in a medium, that is,  \\\\lambda b  \\\\gg 1. With this assumption we can expand the Bessel functions into their asymptotic form: E_1(\\\\omega) \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{i z e \\\\omega}{c^2} \\\\bigg( 1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta^2 \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} \\\\bigg) \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\lambda b}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda b}} E_2(\\\\omega) \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{z e}{v \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{b}} e^{-\\\\lambda b} and B_3(\\\\omega) = \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) \\\\beta E_2(\\\\omega) Thus: \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{dE}{dx_{\\\\text{particle}}} \\\\bigg)_{\\\\text{rad}} = \\\\text{Re} \\\\bigg( \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{z^2 e^2}{c^2} \\\\bigg(-i \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^*}{\\\\lambda} }\\\\bigg) \\\\omega \\\\bigg( 1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta^2 \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) } \\\\bigg) e^{-(\\\\lambda + \\\\lambda^*) a} d\\\\omega \\\\bigg) If \\\\lambda has a positive real part (usually true), the exponential will cause the expression to vanish rapidly at large distances, meaning all the energy is deposited near the path. However, this isn't true when \\\\lambda is purely imaginary - this instead causes the exponential to become 1 and then is independent of a, meaning some of the energy escapes to infinity as radiation - this is Cherenkov radiation. \\\\lambda is purely imaginary if \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) is real and \\\\beta^2 \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) > 1. That is, when \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) is real, Cherenkov radiation has the condition that v > \\\\frac{c}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega})} = \\\\frac{c}{n} . This is the statement that the speed of the particle must be larger than the phase velocity of electromagnetic fields in the medium at frequency \\\\omega in order to have Cherenkov radiation. With this purely imaginary \\\\lambda condition, \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^*}{\\\\lambda}} = i and the integral can be simplified to: \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{dE}{dx_{\\\\text{particle}}} \\\\bigg)_{\\\\text{rad}} = \\\\frac{ z^2 e^2}{c^2} \\\\int_{\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega) > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta^2}} \\\\omega \\\\bigg( 1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta^2 \\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)} \\\\bigg) d\\\\omega = \\\\frac{ z^2 e^2}{c^2} \\\\int_{v > \\\\frac{c}{n(\\\\omega)}} \\\\omega \\\\bigg( 1 - \\\\frac{c^2}{v^2 n^2(\\\\omega)} \\\\bigg) d\\\\omega This is the Frank‚ÄìTamm equation in Gaussian units.

The case is also influential in negligence in the English law of tort (even though English law does not recognise \\"allurement\\" per se). The case's main significance is that, after the shift within the common law of negligence from strict liabilityAs in Re Polemis to a reasonable standard of care,As in Donoghue v Stevenson and The Wagon Mound this case advocated a middle way, namely: *Even if the loss or harm is not itself foreseeable, liability may arise provided the actual loss falls with a \\"foreseeable class of harm\\". This idea was neither developed nor expanded upon, and only one year later the claimant in Doughty v Turner Manufacturing obtained no remedy via this \\"middle way\\".Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Company case reportDoughty v Turner Manufacturing Company [1964] 1 QB 518 However, the case was followed in subsequent cases on occupiers' liability. Facts One evening in November 1958 two boys aged 8 and 10The older boy was the younger boy's uncle. were walking down Russell Road, Edinburgh where some Post Office workers were repairing cables under the street. The men had opened a manhole and had erected a weather tent over it, with an access ladder inside. From mid- afternoon onwards, the tent had four red paraffin warning lamps. The workmen left around 5pm for a tea break nearby; before leaving, they withdrew the ladder, leaving it outside the tent. While the workmen were out, the boys arrived and started meddling with the equipment. They picked up one of the lamps and entered the tent. They took the ladder and proceeded to explore the manhole, after which they safely climbed out again. The younger boy tripped over the lamp, which fell into the manhole and broke. The paraffin leaked and vaporised, causing an explosion with flames reaching up to thirty feet. The impact of the blast caused the 8-year old to fall into the hole and suffer severe burn injuries. The question arose whether the Post Office workers had been negligent in leaving the site unattended with the lamps burning. Under Scots law, they owed a duty of reasonable care to prevent the site becoming an \\"allurement\\" for the boys; had they discharged this duty? On the other hand, the children were trespassers and possibly contributorily negligent. A crucial issue was the likelihood (or foreseeability) of the presence of children on Russell Road, and whether the explosion causing the serious burn injuries was of \\"different type than that could have been foreseeable\\". The court of first instance, the First Division of the Court of Session, limited the liability of the Post Office on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident itself was not foreseeable. The defence had argued that the boys were not only trespassers but also contributorily negligent, but the court responded that the Post Office did not have any exclusive interest in the middle of the road to support a claim of trespass; and taking into consideration the youth of the boy, it was agreed that he was NOT contributorily negligent; and these points were dropped on appeal to the House of Lords). Judgment on appeal Lord Jenkins affirmed the existence of a duty of care by applying the test formulated by Lord Atkin in Donoghue v. Stevenson,Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] AC 562]In Donoghue v. Stevenson Lord Atkin had declared that you take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.\\" saying: \\"the Post Office had brought on the public highway apparatus capable of constituting a source of danger to passer-by ... It was therefore their duty that such passerby, \\"neighbour\\" in the language of Donoghue v. Stevenson, were, so far as reasonably practicable, protected from the various obstacles or allurements, which the workmen had brought to the site. It is clear that the safety precautions taken by the Post Office did not in this instance measure up to Lord Atkin's test.\\" Lord Morris stated that \\"exercising an ordinary, and certainly not an over-exacting, degree of prevention the workmen should have decided, when the tea-break came, that someone had better be left in charge who could repel the intrusion of inquisitive children,\\" thereby casting doubt that the workers had discharged their duty of care. In both the First Division and in the House of Lords, the defence argued that it was unforeseeable that children might be on Russell Road, \\"a quiet road, some four hundred yards away from any houses\\". Lord Morris opined (following the judgement of Lord Ordinary) that \\"if, of, course, there was no likelihood that children might appear, different considerations would apply. But children did appear, and I find no reason to differ from the conclusion of the Lord Ordinary that the presence of children in the immediate vicinity of the shelter was reasonably to be anticipated.\\" Lord Guest declared that the burden of proof that the presence of children was unforeseeable lay with the respondent; and on the facts there was insufficient evidence to do this. He found that it was reasonable to anticipate the danger that might arise by meddling children, and that, \\"... the normal dangers of such children falling into the manhole and injured by a lamp were such that a reasonable man would not have ignored them.\\" It was accepted that the explosion causing the burns was a result of paraffin leaking from the lamp. According to Lord Reid, the boy's injuries from burns was foreseeable. Although the extent of the injury of burn was greater than might have been expected, this was no defence (Eggshell skull rule). However, if the injury were of a different kind than the foreseeable type the defender might have escaped liability. Lord Reid continued that as the cause of the accident - the explosion from paraffin lamp - was known, it left no scope to allege the accident was caused from some unknown source, rather than the fault of the respondent. Lord Reid concluded that the accident in question \\"was but a variant of foreseeable\\" and it mattered not it may have arisen in an unforeseeable manner. Lord Jenkins agreed, finding no justification to hold someone liable if the accident had occurred from the burning of lamp but not if the lamp had exploded. Lord Morris argued that the injury suffered by the boy was of a higher degree, but was \\"of the kind or type of accident which was foreseeable\\". He said the respondent \\"should not escape liability just because they could not foresee the exact way\\" in which the boy might play with the equipment, or the way in which he might get hurt. Allowing the appeal, he found there was a duty owed by the respondent to safeguard the boy against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries, and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they didn't envisage \\"the precise concatenation of circumstances which lead up to the accident.\\" Lord Guest pointed out that for making a coherent chain of causation it is not necessary to follow the minute details leading up to the accident to be reasonably foreseeable, but only that \\"the type of accident caused was of a foreseeable type\\". He was of the view that the lower courts wrongly gave more emphasis on the fact on explosion; to Lord Guest it was a non-essential element. He gave more emphasis on the fact whether burning of paraffin outside the lamp was a reasonable foreseeable event. The lower courts had already concluded these events as a reasonable foreseeable event, but they were of the view the explosion was an unforeseeable event. Lord Guest argued this as a \\"fallacious\\" claim. Lord Guest concluded that the accident and the injuries sustained by the boys should have been reasonably foreseen by the Post Office employees, who were in breach of duty to take adequate protection against the accident. Lord Pearce cited the case of The Wagon Mound (No. 1) which held that a person is not liable if the accident is of a different type than the type which was foreseen by the person. It would be unjust to check each and every details of the foreseeability test too minutely when the case deals with things that can be allurement to children leads to an accident and hard to foresee the exact way in which the accident may take place. In sum, all judges allowed the boy's appeal. The decision was followed in Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council,Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council [2000] 1 WLR 1082 (For a similar case arising under US law, see Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad,Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co. 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99 (1928) a case which had been influential upon the court in Donoghue v Stevenson).

The plot and content of the conversation is drawn from popular mythology but the performance mainly consists of an impromptu debate between characters involving sarcasm, puns, philosophy positions and humour. The main plot is sung from the same oral texts used for the Yakshgana form of dance- drama. Performers claim that this was a more intellectual rendition of the dance during the monsoon season. The art form is popular in Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Shimoga districts of Karnataka and Kasaragod district of Kerala. It is a derived form of Yakshagana‚Äîa classical dance or musical form of art from the same region. Performances A typical Tala-Maddale show consists of veteran artists sitting in a circular fashion along with a Bhagavata (the singer, with \\"Tala\\" or pair of small hand cymbals) and a \\"Maddale\\" (a type of drum) player. Artists play the roles of characters in stories, typically, from Ramayana, Mahabharata, and other puranas. Some consider them as a good presentation of oratorial skills. Artists are normally well versed with the Hindu epics and puranas. Kannada language is the normal medium of communication. Tala-Maddale performances are mostly held during the night, the traditional reason being that in ancient times, people finished their work by this time and assembled in temples to watch Tala Maddale. It is organized by either hobbyists who are interested in the art at their houses or as a public event in villages and towns. As is common in many Indian art forms, A Tala Maddale performance is commenced with a puja to Lord Ganesh (the Hindu God of knowledge, learning and art) with a prayer song by Bhagavatha. Usually this song is \\"Gajamukhadavage ganapage\\". This tends to be followed by a combination of pre scripted as well as ex tempore debates between the artists. Hence, while the average length of a performance is about three hours, it can extend depending upon the debate. Due to the latter, artists are expected to be well versed with the subject matter too. In ancient times, Tala-Maddale performances often took the form of all-night performances, from 7 pm right up to 6 am. Subjects of Tala Maddale performances normally focus on episodes from the Hindu epics of Bhagavata and Puranas. However, episodes have also been created on other more current issues, some of which include the Second World War, the Tashkent Agreement, the Indian freedom struggle (Swarajya Vijaya) and computerisation (Ganakasura Kalaga). Some of the popular Tala maddale artists are Sheni Gopala Krishna Bhat, Kerekai Krishna Bhat, Kerekai Umakant Bhat, Polali Shankaranarayana Shastri, Shankaranarayana Samaga, Matti Subba Rao, Vasudeva Samaga, Prabhakara Joshi, M.V. Hegde, Kumble Sundara Rao, M.L. Samaga, Padekallu Vishnu Bhat, Sadashiva Alva Talapady, Appu Nayak Athrady, Ramana Acharya, Krishnapura Hari Bhat and Prashanth Belur. Artha vaibhava or the grandeur of dialogues tends to be a highlight of these performances relished by the rasikas (audience). In August 2016, the story of the Indian Freedom Struggle, Swarajya Vijaya, was enacted in Tala Maddale in the outer yard of the Sri Ananteshwara Temple at Rajangana, Karnataka. The episode (prasanga) had been written by M.V. Hegde. A similar Tala Maddale performance related to the Indian freedom struggle had been held at this very place on 14 August 1947 when India achieved freedom from British Colonial powers.

He famously battled a giant, and is sometimes said to be a giant himself, though normally he is just represented as possessing giant-like strength. Various stories of his exploits have grown up. In one version he is fabled to have been a simple labourer at the time of the Norman Conquest and to have killed a giant in the marsh at Tilney, Norfolk armed only with an axle-tree stuck into a cartwheel. When his makeshift weapon broke he grabbed a \\"lusty rawboned miller\\" and used him as a weapon instead. This exploit earned him the governorship of Thanet. At the church in Walpole St Peter there is a depression in the ground, where it is said a cannonball landed after he threw it to scare away the devil (in this version Tom is a giant). In the fairy tale as told by Joseph Jacobs, Tom lived in marsh of the Isle of Ely and although initially lazy and gluttonous, he was prodigiously tall and it soon became apparent that he had the strength of twenty men. Various proofs of his strength are given: he carried twenty hundredweight of straw and a tree as if they weighed nothing, kicked a football so far that nobody could find it and turned the tables on four men who tried to rob him. He eventually got a job carting beer in Wisbech, but the long journey tired him, so one day he cut across the land of the Wisbech Giant. The giant took this badly and fetched his club to beat Tom, but at this point Tom took the axletree and cartwheel and fought the giant. After a furious battle the giant was killed. Tom took his land and was from then on held in esteem by the people of the area. Jacobs cites his source as the chapbook in the Pepysian Library from around 1660, edited by G. L. Gomme. Gomme's introduction states that there was evidence that an axle-tree and cartwheel had figured on a stone tomb in Tilney churchyard and local accounts associated these with a man named Hickifric who had withstood the tyranny of the lord of the manor. It has been suggested that he echoes the Norse god Thor (Anglo-Saxon: √ûunor): they were both known for fighting giants, ate prodigiously and used a hammer-like weapon (there is even a suggestion that the \\"miller\\" and Thor's hammer Mjolnir come from the same source). He is mentioned in Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy and Lavengro by George Borrow, although Borrow places his exploits as far north as Lincolnshire. The elaborate moulded plasterwork (pargeting) decorating the Old Sun Inn in Saffron Walden, Essex features his battle against the Wisbech Giant. There are still references to Hickathrift in the Wisbech area. Hickathrift Farm, Hickathrift House and Hickathrift Corner exist. The large indentation known as Hickathrift's Washbasin has however been built over. A large stone cross remains in Tilny All Saints churchyard, thought to be the last of three that were collectively known as Hickathrift's Candlesticks. A character named Hiccafrith, based on Tom, appears in Marcus Pitcaithly's Hereward trilogy.

It is operated by Alberta Health Services ‚Äì Calgary Health Region. The new facility opened on September 27, 2006, and is the first free-standing pediatric facility to be built in Canada in more than 20 years. It was originally opened on May 19, 1922, as the Junior Red Cross Children's Hospital. It is located west of the University of Calgary campus grounds and just across from the site of the Foothills Medical Centre. ACH is one of several children's hospitals in Canada (others being Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Stollery Children's Hospital in Edmonton, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine in Montr√©al, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton, The Children's Hospital of Winnipeg in Winnipeg, Children's Hospital at London Health Sciences Centre in London, Ontario, BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver and IWK Health Centre in Halifax). Design The Alberta Children's Hospital was designed with substantial input from young patients, as well as families, physicians and staff of the hospital. In 2002, architects created renderings of how the hospital could look; a multi-storey brick building. These drawings were brought to the hospital's Teen Advisory Group (TAG) and changed substantially into a colourful building closely resembling toy building blocks. The idea for the Alberta Children's Hospital was to create a building that would reduce stress and promote healing. The interior of the hospital has been designed to enable the delivery of family centred care. The hospital includes supports for families such as sleeping facilities for parents in each patient room, a babysitting service for siblings of patients, a sacred space for spiritual activities, a pet visitation room and the Healing Gardens that surround the new hospital, giving parents and their children areas to heal, to have fun and to spend private time. The Alberta Children's Hospital is used by patients from birth to age 18 from southern Alberta, southeastern British Columbia and southwestern Saskatchewan. It is an accredited pediatric level I trauma centre by the Trauma Association of Canada. Additionally, the ACH is the provincial expert and referral centre for bone marrow transplantation, and is the leader in Western Canada (which is rapidly establishing itself as the national leader), for pediatric neurosciences. It also is the only pediatric hospital in Canada that consists of a comprehensive Behavioral Unit, is the world leader in congenital cataracts surgery, and has the largest pediatric vision clinic in all of Western Canada.First in North America with Laser Eye Surgery for Kids!

Ribas was born in Luanda, the son of Arnaldo Gon√ßalves Ribas (who was Portuguese) and Maria de Concei√ß√£o Bento Faria (Angolan). His first publications were two novels: Nuvens que passam (Clouds that pass) in 1927 and Resgate de uma falta (Rescue of a lack) in 1929. Ribas suffered from gradual loss of eyesight in his 20s. Nevertheless, he continued to research and write. In 1950 he published: Flores e espinhos (Flowers and Thorns) and Uanga ( Magic ) and in 1952 Ecos da minha terra (Echoes of my land). Together with Echoes Of My Land and The Evil Spell (1951), Ribas's writings took on a distinct African character. The Evil Spell is about the marriage of an African man and woman. It is interwoven with Mbundu fables, songs, and folklore. In 1969, Ribas published an expanded edition of the novel. Researches Ribas also conducted and published seminal researches. In 1958 Ribas published Ilundo: Angolan Divinations and Rites, his 18-year study of Mbundu culture and religion. His second publication on Angolan culture was Missosso: Traditional Angolan Literature. This three-volume work was published in 1961. It was a linguistic work that also contained a vernacular dictionary and Portuguese translations of Angolan tales. The fascination Ribas had for Angolan culture and his affection for the country received in-depth treatment in his autobiography All of This Happened (1975).

The church was inspired by a sermon preached by Anglican minister Reverend Dr. W. Herbert Burk, founder and first rector of the parish. The building was designed by architect Milton B. Medary. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 2017,National Register of Historic Places Program: Weekly List, May 12, 2017 (week of 5/01/17 through 5/05/17), SG100000943, Listed 5/1/2017. and is undergoing an active restoration campaign.http://wmchapel.org/heritage/ It is physically located in Upper Merion Township. // Compare with History 261x261px 298x298px Reverend Burk was rector of an Episcopal church in nearby Norristown. The money for the chapel was raised in small increments (nickels and dimes), and its stone walls were built a \\"few feet at a time.\\" In the religious and patriotic zeal of the day, Dr. Burk was active in trying to preserve Valley Forge, and in the establishment of the Valley Forge Museum of American History (the predecessor to the Valley Forge Historical Society). A previous attempt to build a memorial church at Valley Forge had been launched in 1885 by Baptist minister James M. Guthrie, who raised funds and began building before running out of funds. On June 19, 1903, the 125th anniversary of the evacuation of the Continental Army from Valley Forge, the cornerstone was laid on property donated by the I. Heston Todd family. A small wood-framed building nearby preceded the present structure. Following President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to the site and address in 1904, the original wooden building was named the \\"Theodore Roosevelt Chapel.\\" It was demolished after completion of the present chapel. The Chapel's exterior was completed in 1917 and its interior in 1921. It serves as a wayside chapel to those who visit Valley Forge National Historical Park, and is open to the public. Noted ironsmith Samuel Yellin produced the wrought iron gates, hardware, and locks. He was one of many artisans to produce sculptures, stonework, stained glass and metal work. The interior woodwork was supplied by Belgian-American cabinetmaker Edward Maene (1852-1931).Lita Solis-Cohen, \\"Winterthur‚Äôs Philadelphia Furniture Forum: What Was Learned?\\" Furniture News, March 5, 2014. From the visitor's perspective the Chapel, with its central location, can appear to be a part of the park. However, the Chapel and surrounding property belong to the Episcopal Church. Across Valley Forge Park Road (formerly, Port Kennedy Road), standing opposite from the Chapel, is the builder's model of the Washington Monument. This obelisk marks the grave of Lieutenant John Waterman. The original Waterman gravestone had been on display in the visitor's center museum. The Bell Tower houses the DAR Patriot Rolls, listing those that served in the Revolutionary War, and the Chapel grounds hosted the World of Scouting Museum until ca. 2013. National Patriots Bell Tower and Carillon 313x313px The National Patriots Bell Tower was a later addition to the Chapel, and houses its carillon. The tower was built entirely with funds raised by members of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) over a period of more than a decade. Construction began in 1941, but was suspended due to World War II, and restarted in 1949.Shelley, p. 33. The bell tower was completed and dedicated in 1953. The Justice Bell (Women's Liberty Bell) is on permanent display in the bell tower chamber. It was forged in 1915 as a nearly identical replica of the Liberty Bell, and became an instrumental symbol of the Women's Suffrage movement. In 1920, after touring many parts of the country to promote the passing of the 19th Amendment, the bell was stored on the grounds of Valley Forge National Park before being permanently moved to the bell tower chamber in 1943. The bell tower contains a traditional carillon, with a keyboard of 58 bells. The first 14 bells (from the Meneely Bell Foundry) were installed in a temporary wooden tower in 1926, and the number of bells expanded over the course of three decades. Fifty-six bells were installed in the bell tower in 1953, and expanded to 58 bells in 1963 with two bells from the Fonderie Paccard in France. The bell tower is played regularly by a resident carilloneur. Concerts, both formal and informal, are held throughout the year and are open to the public.

It currently is the administrative center for the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, District III. Lake Lena is located 25 miles east of Hinckley; and 7 miles west-northwest of Danbury, Wisconsin. Lake Lena is 24 miles east-southeast of Sandstone. Grace Lake Road (Pine County 173) serves as a main route in the community. State Highway 48 (MN 48) is nearby. Its name in the Ojibwe language is Aazhoomog, meaning \\"Crossroads\\" in reference to being at the former crossroad of the north‚Äìsouth trail connecting Bikoganaagan (Danbury), via the former Agaming (Outflow/\\"Lower Tamarack River Village\\"), and the former Gibaakwa'iganing (Tozer Camp/\\"lower Upper Tamarack River Village\\") with the east‚Äìwest trail connecting Mooningwanekaaning (La Pointe), via Namekaawa'iganing (Gordon), with Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag (Hinckley). History =Pre-Dakota= Before the arrival of the Dakota Sioux, the area about Lake Lena was inhabited by the Cheyenne, Fox and Ho-Chunk, with migratory Gros Ventre, Mandwe and Menominee peoples. The Lake Lena area served as a place abundant with food, in the heart of the Folle Avoine Region, with Wild Rice and Sturgeon. In addition, the Lake Lena Village was located along the site of the annual Bear migratory path. =Dakota= With the arrival of the Dakota Sioux, only the Fox remained as permanent residents of the region. However, occasional Cheyenne, Ho-Chunk and Menominee peoples still came to the area for the Wild Rice. The Santee Sioux maintained a trade network routes offered by the St. Croix River, and the series of trails connecting the Lake Lena Village with Lake Superior, Mississippi River headwaters and other major upper Mississippi River destinations, Red Cedar River and Chippewa River. With the arrival of the Ojibwe from the cultural center in La Pointe, the area about the upper St. Croix River became a contested place. Though the Fox were permanently pushed out of the area, the Dakota and Ojibwe eventually came to peace and lived side-by-side. =Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe= After the Ojibwe had gained control of the upper St. Croix River valley, the Lake Lena area became one of many network of trade villages. However, in the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien, the United States formally drew the boundaries separating the Dakota and the Ojibwe. For the Lake Lena and other Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe, already intertwined with the Dakota, this posed a problem. With agreements, the more southern Dakota north of the \\"Prairie du Chien Line\\" moved south of the line with the more northern Dakota north of the line were adopted as \\"Ojibwe\\" and became the Wolf Totem. Meanwhile, many of the Ojibwe located south of the line were adopted into the Mdewakanton. By maintaining the trade network but with a different tribal association, Aazhoomog transitioned from a Dakota-Ojibwe village to a fully Ojibwe village. The Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe of the upper St. Croix River valley became one of the signatories to the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters and the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe. The 1837 treaty, dubbed the \\"White Pine Treaty\\", brought an influx of lumber industry. After the Sandy Lake Tragedy, the United States encouraged the consolidation of the Ojibwe onto Indian Reservations rather than removing them west of the Mississippi River. In the treaty negotiations for the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe, St. Croix Chippewa realized that a central reservation would be created immediately south of the Upper St. Croix Lake near Solon Springs, Wisconsin. Due to strong lumber interests, the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe knew the removal to a reservation would mean eventual loss of hunting, fishing and gathering rights promised the 1837 and 1842 treaties. Upon this realization, the St. Croix Chippewa refuted all provisions of the treaty negotiations and did not sign the 1854 treaty. However, by not signing the treaty, the St. Croix Chippewa lost their federal recognition. However, even as un-recognized Indian Tribe, the St. Croix Chippewa was still eligible to receive their annuities. Depending on the time and location, peoples of St. Croix Chippewa went to either the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation or to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. Eventually, the Lake Lena Village, through the lumber operations in the region, went to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation more often than to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. =Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe= After the loss of federal recognition of the St. Croix Chippewa, the population of the Aazhoomog slowly declined. For their annuity payment, the people of Aazhoomog were sent to either the Lake Mille Lacs Indian Reservation or the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. Eventually, the Aazhoomog Village, through the lumber operations in the region, went to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation more often than to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. Aazhoomog's English name \\"Lake Lena\\" came about during this time, named after Mrs. Lena Thayer, who operated a post office until the early 1920s. Beginning in 1922, under the authority of the Consolidated Chippewa Agency, Lake Lena Village began receiving services independent of the Mille Lacs Indians or the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians. In 1936, when Minnesota Chippewa Tribe was created under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe was further divided between those located in Minnesota and those located in Wisconsin. When the contemporary Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe was organized, its charter included the Mille Lacs Indians, Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa and the St. Croix Band of Chippewa Indians. This was praised in the Lake Lena Village for regaining Federal recognition after 85 years of not having Federal recognition, though it was not independent Federal recognition. However, this posed a major problem for the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe on the Wisconsin side, especially for those living about Danbury, Wisconsin since the charter also included them, yet they were not eligible to receive services from the Consolidated Chippewa Agency of Minnesota. The remaining St. Croix Chippewa on the Wisconsin side, in order to maintain cohesion of the un-recognized tribe, sought and gained Federal recognition independent of both the Mille Lacs and Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservations, becoming the contemporary St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Today, the Aazhoomog village houses the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III Government Services and Community Center and the Aazhoomog Clinic of the Ne-Ia-Shing Clinic System. The United States Postal Service places Aazhoomog under Sandstone, Minnesota, though a separate community of Asinikaaning exists. The Lake Lena Village relies on the nearby Swiss Township fire department for fire emergencies. Near the village, the Mille Lacs Band operates the Crossroads Marathon gas station, convenience store, and laundromat.

Early life and career  He was born on 23 February 1931 in the Melbourne suburb of Kew.Rich, Maria F. (ed.), excerpt from \\"Weaving, John\\", Who's Who in Opera: An International Biographical Directory of Singers..., Arno Press, 1976, p. 585. This was the very day on which his great forebear Dame Nellie Melba died. His maternal cousin was the tenor Ken Neate. He studied singing with Jessye Schmidt and Browning Mummery before leaving for further studies in London with Dino Borgioli, Joan Cross, Herman Simberg, Audrey Langford, Andrew Field and Glyndebourne's Jani Strasser. During this time he also worked as a rehearsal singer with Sir Thomas Beecham for two years before his friend Richard Bonynge assisted enormously in developing a tenor voice from his former bass-baritone. After a further two years with Bonynge, Weaving was engaged by the Sadler's Wells Opera and made his debut as Danilo in The Merry Widow opposite June Bronhill at the London Coliseum, the first of many hundreds of performances of the role. At Sadler's Wells Weaving also sang Lensky in Eugene Onegin, Alfredo in La traviata, and Rom√©o et Juliette opposite Elsie Morison, as well as other operetta appearances including Pluto in Orpheus in the Underworld, Raoul de Gardefeu in La Vie parisienne and Danilo, all of which were recorded by HMV at Abbey Road studios. In this time he made various recordings with the BBC, the first of which was as Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus direct from a stage performance at the Wells. He also sang again with June Bronhill when he appeared as Sir Walter Raleigh in Merrie England. In 1962, Jon began a tour of Australia and New Zealand for Sadler's Wells, which had become the English National Opera Company. During this time he starred in a weekly television series with Suzanne Steele, which ran on the ABC for three years. He sang with the All-State Symphony Orchestra during this period and on his third tour of New Zealand, directed and sang Frederick in The Pirates of Penzance at Her Majesty's Theatre in Auckland. Returning to Europe in 1966 he was engaged by Benjamin Britten after many Covent Garden auditions for the role of MacHeath in Britten's adaptation of The Beggar's Opera and sang this role under the baton of Norman Del Mar in London, France and in Montreal at the World Expo in 1967. After study with Modesti in Paris he was engaged for his first Wagnerian role, Lohengrin, which he sang first at the Kiel Opera House in 1967. In Kiel, he went on to sing Herman in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades, Otello, Andrier Chenier, Hoffman, Canio, Gounod's Faust, Don Jose, Florestan, MacDuff in Macbeth etc., as well as singing classical operetta roles such as Sou Chong in The Land of Smiles, Danilo in The Merry Widow, The Count of Luxembourg and The Gypsy Baron. He also created roles in four world premieres during this time and later Rashomon for the Olympic Games in Munich. He was constantly offered Wagnerian roles and finally agreed to sing Siegmund under the baton of Hans Zender and Klaus Tennstedt. This was a success and was followed by Loge in Das Rheingold and Erik in The Flying Dutchman. During this time in Kiel he guested all over Europe and returned to London for performances of Pluto in Orpheus in the Underworld and Bacchus in Ariadne auf Naxos under Sir Charles Mackerras. He made numerous television appearances during this time also e.g. The Phil Silvers Show, where he sang arias and appeared in a duet with his former idol, Sergeant Bilko. He made his debut at the Bavarian State Opera, Munich as Dimitri in Boris Godunov under Rafael Kubel√≠k and then returned to Australia for concerts and a recording of Malcolm Williamson's The Violins of Saint-Jacques with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, which was also released on video. Returning to Europe he finally decided to accept offers to sing both Siegfrieds and sang his first Ring in London under the batons of Sir Charles Mackerras and Sir Reginald Goodall. His first German Ring was in Wiesbaden and he was offered numerous contracts to sing the two roles in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and France. He continued every year to sing the Siegfrieds and Siegmund in the famous English Ring in London and went on to create the Siegfrieds in the Herz Ring in Wagner's birthplace, Leipzig. He sang in this famous production for several seasons before deciding to take his family back to Australia, where he was to sing a recital tour with Geoffrey Parsons, record two albums and sing numerous concerts for the ABC throughout Australia. He sang Siegmund and Siegfried for the Australian Opera, again under Sir Charles Mackerras and performed Die Walk√ºre with both Hiroyuki Iwaki and Leif Segerstam. With his wife, the Swedish soprano Monique Brynnel, he made a television series and appeared in numerous concerts and sang with her in seasons with the Victorian and Queensland Opera companies. He lived in Kew in Melbourne and made a career teaching singing privately, having numerous successful students enter the opera world. He had two sons; Jon (b. 1955 to first wife soprano Margaret Nisbett) and Jack (b. 1974). Jon was offered numerous film roles, the highlight of which was to be invited to Rome by Federico Fellini to screen test for the lead in Fellini's Casanova. This he declined in order to continue his operatic career. He had many very successful singing students. In May 2011, Jon Weaving and Monique Brynnel emigrated from Australia to Sweden. They established a singing school in their new home town. Jon Weaving died of pancreatic cancer in Sweden on 19 October 2011, aged 80.

The seventeenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, and eighth hurricane of the season, Michael developed from a non-tropical system to the southwest of Bermuda on October 15\\\\. The system was initially subtropical, but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by October 17\\\\. Michael quickly strengthened into a hurricane later that day. By October 20, Michael peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale at a relatively high latitude of 44¬∞N. The storm weakened slightly to a Category 1 hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in Newfoundland on October 20\\\\. As the intensity of Michael was equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane during landfall, high winds were reported throughout Atlantic Canada, especially in Newfoundland. Winds from the storm peaked at in St. Lawrence, Newfoundland; other locations across the island reported winds of . High winds caused minor structure damage across Newfoundland, confined to vinyl siding peeled off, shattered windows, and unroofed houses. In addition, sporadic power outages were also reported from Corner Brook to St. John's. Michael also dropped rainfall across Atlantic Canada and in Maine. The rainfall was generally light, with much of the region reporting between of precipitation. Michael also produced high tides, accompanied by waves reported as high as by a buoy well offshore of Newfoundland. Meteorological history The system originated out of a non-tropical cold-core upper level low that drifted southward into the subtropics. The low interacted with a cold front, which resulted in the development of a stationary front over the Bahamas on October 10\\\\. As the cold low drifted southward, a surface low developed on October 12\\\\. The surface low remained mostly stationary until early on October 15 as it merged with the upper-level low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida. Later that day, the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression. The storm remained stationary over warm water, with sea surface temperatures around , while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics. Around 0000 UTC on October 16, it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm. Later that day, the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the low-level circulation. Hurricane Michael intensifying over the alt=A hurricane moving over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream By 0000 UTC on October 17, the transition was completed and Michael was reclassified as a tropical storm as supported by satellite classifications via the Dvorak technique. Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Seventeen; post-analysis later discovered it was actually a tropical storm. A well-defined eye quickly developed early on October 17 as Michael began to strengthen and continued to organize. That afternoon, Michael rapidly intensified further and was upgraded to a hurricane as Reconnaissance flights found winds of . At that point, Michael began to move northward. While Michael was maintaining minimal hurricane status, the eye remained ragged, yet well-defined. Early on October 19, Michael briefly strengthened to 140 km/h (85 mph) before weakening slightly six hours later. Tracking into cooler water, Michael began its extratropical transition while accelerating to the northeast towards Newfoundland, which prevented significant weakening. The acceleration was caused by a shortwave trough embedded within strong southwesterly mid-level flow. Unexpectedly, Michael began to rapidly intensify on October 19 while in extratropical transition. Later that day, a ship report in the eastern eyewall reported a minimum central pressure of and maximum sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), making Michael a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. The sudden intensification was determined to have been as a result of baroclinic effects as it interacted with an incoming trough, which provided additional energy to counter the general weakening of hurricanes while in the high latitudes over sea-surface temperatures around . At 2300 UTC on October 19, shortly after completing its transition to an extratropical cyclone, Michael made landfall near Parsons Harbour, Newfoundland with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). The extratropical system gradually weakened as it tracked across Newfoundland on October 20, and slowed down considerably with the presence of the trough. The storm was absorbed by another extratropical low just north of Newfoundland that afternoon. Impact Rain accumulations with Michael Because it was unknown that Michael became extratropical before landfall, it was initially considered the first tropical cyclone to strike Newfoundland since Hurricane Luis in 1995. Furthermore, Michael was also considered the first hurricane to make landfall in Canada since Hurricane Hortense in 1996. When the Meteorological Service of Canada and the National Research Council flew a Convair research flight into Michael on October 19, it was the first successful research flight made into a tropical cyclone by those agencies. Subsequent flights have been made into Tropical Storm Karen, Hurricane Isabel (while inland), Hurricane Juan, and Hurricane Ophelia. =Newfoundland= alt=Radar image of a storm moving over Newfoundland In advance of the storm, the Newfoundland Weather Centre posted wind warnings, gale warnings, storm warnings, and hurricane warnings throughout Newfoundland. Rainfall advisories were also issued in portions of the East Coast, Central Newfoundland, the South Coast, and the West Coast. Offshore, storm force wind warnings were declared on October 19 for Newfoundland waters. Several Special Weather Statements were also posted. Light to moderate damage was reported throughout Newfoundland, primarily as a result of the strong winds. The entire region was affected by Michael, though the majority of the damage was confined to small communities east of where the storm made landfall, including Gaultois, Harbour Breton, Hermitage and English Harbour West. These areas reported significant power outages and minor structural damage; vinyl siding was peeled off, windows were shattered, and roof shingles were torn off in some localized locations. The most severe damage was in Gaultois, where several roofs were torn off and trees were uprooted.

Centurione II Zaccaria (died 1432), scion of a powerful Genoese merchant family established in the Morea, was installed as Prince of Achaea by Ladislaus of Naples in 1404 and was the last ruler of the Latin Empire not under Byzantine suzerainty. Centurione was the son of Andronikos Asen Zaccaria and grandson of Centurione I Zaccaria. He succeeded his father in the barony of Arkadia (modern Kyparissia) in 1402. Though young, he was ambitious and he overthrew his aunt, Maria II Zaccaria, in Achaea in 1404; a move which was approved by his overlord, the king of Naples. Immediately, he reinforced his power on a local basis by marrying Creusa, the daughter of Leonardo II Tocco, lord of Zante and niece of Carlo I Tocco whose dominions covered Cephalonia and Lefkada and extended to Epirus and the western Peloponnese. Centurione then made his brother Stephen the Latin Archbishop of Patras. However, Centurione was quickly at war with his alienated relatives. His wife's cousin Carlo I Tocco, duke of Leucas, had Ladislaus absolve him from his feudal obligations to Achaea (1406) and then, allied with Theodore I Palaiologos, Despot of Morea, made war on the principality, conquering Glarentza (1408), long the principality's chief seaport. His brother Stephen, however, abandoned the diocese of Patras to the Venetians on loan for five years. Centurione himself was forced to ally with the Venetians and Justinian, Lord of Chios, and to hire Albanian mercenaries to retake the port on 12 July 1414. In return for military protection, he granted the ports of Glarentza and Navarino to the Giustiniani family of Genoa. Thereafter, for three years, Centurione could obtain no help from Genoa, pressed by the Duke of Milan on land and by the Crown of Aragon at sea. In 1417, the imperial army of Constantinople, led by the despot Theodore II Palaeologus and Emperor John VIII, invaded Achaea. They took Messenia and Elis and holed up Centurione in Glarentza, from which he fled by sea in the spring of 1418. A little later, Patras too fell. Only by the mediation of the Venetians occupying Navarino was the prince able to secure a truce. All that was left of the principality that once dominated Greece were a few fortresses, such as the ancestral castle and barony of Chalandritsa. In 1429, Thomas Palaeologus of the Morea besieged Centurione in Chalandritsa and extracted a treaty from him whereby his daughter, Catherine, would marry the despot and thus make him Centurione's heir in Achaea. Centurione was allowed to keep his inheritance, the barony of Arcadia (not to be confused with the region of the same name). Centurione retired to Arcadia in 1430, after the marriage was finalised. He died there two years later. His domains passed to the despotate of Morea and into Byzantine hands.Donald M. Nicol, The immortal emperor: the life and legend of Constantine Palaiologos, last emperor of the Romans, (Cambridge [England]: University Press, 1992), p. 12 Centurione left one illegitimate son, John Asen Zaccaria, who was the centre of later revolts against Greek authority.

He was the son of gynecologist Johann Baptist Chiari (1817‚Äì1854), and brother to rhinolaryngologist Ottokar Chiari (1853‚Äì1918).  Biography  Chiari studied medicine in Vienna, where he was an assistant to Karl Freiherr von Rokitansky (1804‚Äì1878) and Richard Ladislaus Heschl (1824‚Äì1881). In 1878 he received his habilitation in pathological anatomy, and within a few years became an associate professor at the University of Prague. At Prague he was also superintendent of the pathological-anatomical museum. In 1906 he relocated to the University of Strasbourg as a professor of pathological anatomy. Chiari's research dealt largely with postmortem examinations, and most of his numerous writings are the result of autopsies. In the 1890s he described a condition involving deformities of the cerebellum, and brainstem in children with herniation of the spinal cord.Arnold‚ÄìChiari malformation @ Who Named It The phenomenon was later to become known as the \\"Arnold‚ÄìChiari malformation\\", named after Chiari and German pathologist, Julius Arnold (1835‚Äì1915). The malformation was given its name in 1907 by two of Dr. Arnold's students.Julius Arnold @ Who Named It Another medical term named after Chiari is the Budd‚ÄìChiari syndrome, which is ascites and cirrhosis of the liver caused by an obstruction of the hepatic veins due to a blood clot.

In the United States, Canada and Australia, it is the ninth episode but it's the tenth overall and was written by Oliver Goldstick and directed by Ken Whittingham. This episodes's title is a pun on a former ABC sitcom, Who's the Boss?, which starred Judith Light, who became a regular on this series. Plot It's the day after Thanksgiving. Betty finds Daniel Meade, fully naked in bed with just his black socks and black underwear on. He reminds him that she picked him up drunk in a bar last night. When he asks her where she slept, her answer was 'In your arms,' but she's just teasing; she actually slept on the couch. He bitterly tells her that Sofia ran away with her perfect boyfriend and 'his perfect chin' (aka Hunter, her fianc√©). She tries to reassure him that a lot can change in a short time and tucks him back into bed. Betty goes downstairs and tells her father to be nice to Daniel when he wakes up. Another surprise guest, Santos, walks into the kitchen in a kimono and Ignacio says he liked it better when he sneaked out in the middle of the night. Daniel eventually comes down and tries to leave quietly, but Ignacio finds him and pulls him into the kitchen. Santos begins to compliment Daniel on his publicized history with the ladies before Ignacio brings Daniel a plate of food that sends him running to the bathroom. Meanwhile, back at MODE, Wilhelmina is going through the litany of destructions that befell her office to Marc. He tried to pretend that he was in Schenectady on Thanksgiving, but she knows that it was him after she discovered the 15 grams of fat left behind in the form of a cashew Amanda dropped. However that issue would be put aside when Bradford calls to tell Wilhelmina to turn on Fashion TV where they see Isaac Mizrahi reporting on an elusive sought-after couple. Bradford then tells her that they've been chosen to reveal 'baby Chutney' (the newborn of celebrity couple Tim and Chloe) to the world for the first time. Betty walks into the office and finds Sofia leaving a note for Daniel; he hasn't been calling her back. She begins to go on about her marriage plans with Hunter before confessing to Betty that she isn't sure anymore, but would Daniel even care? Betty tries to feign disinterest and they return to work. Bradford comes down looking for Daniel, worried about the photo shoot for Tim and Chloe's baby. Sofia has offered to do the writing. Betty calls Daniel, still mildly drunk and mollycoddled on the sofa by Justin and Ignacio. He tells Betty that he is not going anywhere and he's having a Christmas tree delivered to her family. Betty begins to wonder how she will get this shoot taken care of. While Justin starts to tell Daniel about issues of MODE he's saved, Ignacio slips away to ask Hilda how long she thinks Santos will stay this time, now that Hilda and Santos had their night of lovemaking. Back at MODE, Bruno the stylist arrives with Amanda. He tries to fob Betty off while she makes excuses for Daniel. He demands coffee and starts explaining his concept to Amanda. Meanwhile, Wilhelmina and Marc are driving around town worrying about the shoot. Marc sends Amanda a message that Wilhelmina knows all about their secret romp; Amanda scarfs down a croissant. Amanda then sends Marc a text message back which obviously outs him as the culprit even though Wilhelmina is unaware it was Amanda who answered the phone (she took Marc's phone from him after seeing the text, then threw it out the window). He begins to wheeze while Wilhelmina demands to know why he was calling the hospital. But just as she was about give Marc the grilling the car gets a flat while Marc hyperventilates. Betty continues trying to call Daniel while Sofia tries to get information out of Betty about him. Bruno starts to go through a series of baby outfits before deciding on a chain mail outfit. Betty questions the choice, but he says he won't take critiques from someone who trims her bangs with a lighter. Meanwhile, Daniel goes through the homemade ornaments of Betty's family while they decorate the tree. They ask him to hang an ornament but he isn't sure how; he was never allowed to touch the Christmas tree growing up. Later on in the day, Christina tries to sort out a costume for the baby while Betty calls Daniel again. He's enjoying decorating her tree; it was just a photo opportunity in his family. He tells her that she should look after things; she always wants more responsibility. The designer then goes into a panic. He just received a photo of the baby and it's hideous. Betty says that maybe he's not the right person for the job if he doesn't think he can find something beautiful in a baby. He tells her she should find someone who designs installations for the zoo and storms out. On the way out, he asks Sofia who she was. Sofia answers 'Today, she's the boss'. Sofia offers to help Betty, but Betty explains that Daniel's heart is broken and he's drunk himself sick. Amanda then walks in and announces that 'team Baby Chutney has arrived and is waiting.' Across town, Wilhelmina and Marc decide to go grab a cab. As they do, Marc tries to make excuses for his behavior by pretending that he didn't know anything about who was on the phone, but she tells him that he stepped way over the line; she doesn't know that she can protect him anymore. The person he tried to call (the mystery woman) is not amused. The driver pulls over and throws them out after Wilhelmina begins insulting him for getting lost (After all, she did say \\"Take the side streets\\"). She left her bag in the back of the cab and now they're stranded. They walk the streets and ask some prostitutes for cash. The prostitutes start feeling up Wilhelmina's fur and she tries to talk slang to them but fails abysmally. Marc pretends to be her pimp (he calls Wilhelmina \\"Lil' Kim\\") and ushers her off before the girls can go for their knives. They later end up in a church, where Wilhelmina complains how she can't do her job anymore because she has to look after Daniel all the time but then lets slip her plot to take over Meade Publications, thus giving Marc an idea to guarantee his future. They rob the poor box for cab fare but Wilhelmina leaves a diamond earring in return. At the Suarez house, Santos tries to get Justin to come out and play football, to get away from the glamour, to be a 'normal kid', only to see this picture perfect family moment come apart when Hilda and Santos begin arguing. She's comfortable with who Justin is and so is Justin. She says that Santos has no business telling her how to raise their son, after having walked out on them three years earlier. Upset, Santos says 'adios' and walks out. Daniel stays with Justin making ornaments as they decorate the tree. He apologizes to Ignacio for stepping in all day, yet Ignacio thanks him, telling him that he'll make a good father. Later on at MODE, Betty tries to create a concept; she's going to portray Tim and Chloe as a 21st Century Adam and Eve in a jungle setting. She calls Daniel with her idea, but he says that she should bring Tim and Chloe to her house for the shoot. Betty goes to the elevator and Sofia is there. Betty asks her for a ride back to her house. They arrive at the Suarezes' and Betty tells Sofia that she needs to tell Daniel that the next time Sofia sees him, she'll be someone's wife. After escaping a harrowing experience known as the seedy part of Queens, Wilhelmina and Marc return to the office and she's outraged the shoot has been moved to Queens. She gets a call from her mysterious friend, saying that she's an old friend from college. Realizing an opportunity after finding out that Wilhelmina never went to college, Marc says that they don't have any secrets anymore; he wants job security and a company credit card in exchange for keeping her secret. Marc also told Amanda that she was off the hook, but \\"...it would cost her.\\" Inside Betty's house, everything is prepared as Ignacio and Daniel look out the window. Daniel asks him how to say 'I love you and can't live without you' in Spanish. Ignacio tells him, then wishes him luck. Outside, Sofia tells Betty that she's wasting her life at MODE: She should come and work for her. Betty doesn't know what to say. She goes inside and tells Daniel he should talk to Sofia before she leaves. In the snow, he tells her that he comes from a very messed up family and asks for one more chance before he bungles a Spanish declaration of love, although he messes up and says 'I love my camera' instead. He gives her an ornament he made and asks her to pick out a tree with him. They kiss. Back inside, Daniel tells Betty that he convinced Sofia to stay and tells her to take the job she offered; he doesn't want to get in her way, she deserves more. She hugs him. After he leaves, the family talks about how exciting it all was and how Betty just got another job offer. But the celebration takes a serious turn for the worse for the Suarezes when the doorbell rings and two immigration officers come to inform Ignacio that he is under arrest while the family is celebrating in the living room. Reception Entertainment Weekly's Michaeal Sleazak gave the episode a great review by noting, \\"Speaking of holiday treats, I don't even know where to start with this episode, arguably the funniest in Betty's short, punch-line-filled run. Wilhelmina and Marc stranded in the boroughs? Hilda and Daniel defending Justin's freedom of fabulousness? Betty doing battle with an out-of-control stylist? Baby Chutney? The amazing thing about Ugly Betty is that its large cast of characters contains no weak links ‚Äî well, except for Walter, and let's give thanks he had the night off.\\"From EW.com Ratings \\"Lose the Boss\\" would be the lowest-rated Ugly Betty episode of the first season, coming in 48th with only 8.74 million viewers in the United States tuning in.Week of November 20th-26th/2006 complete ratings References Also starring *Kevin Alejandro (Santos) *Salma Hayek (Sofia Reyes) Guest stars *Isaac Mizrahi (Himself) Category:Ugly Betty (season 1) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes ","title":"Lose the Boss"},{"id":"7703520","text":"This Is Us is an American family comedy drama television series.

Ivanov, Anatoly Vershik and Oleg Viro. Work Rokhlin's contributions to topology include Rokhlin's theorem, a result of 1952 on the signature of 4-manifolds. He also worked in the theory of characteristic classes, homotopy theory, cobordism theory, and in the topology of real algebraic varieties. In measure theory, Rokhlin introduced what are now called Rokhlin partitions. He introduced the notion of standard probability space, and characterised such spaces up to isomorphism mod 0\\\\. He also proved the famous Rokhlin lemma. Family His son Vladimir Rokhlin, Jr. is a well-known mathematician and computer scientist at Yale University.

Her keel was laid on 26 June 1982 at Robert Derecktor Shipyard Incorporated, Middletown, Rhode Island. She was named for John Canfield Spencer, United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1843 to 1844 under President John Tyler and launched on 17 April 1984 and was commissioned into service on 28 June 1986. In March 1991, Spencer towed a disabled U.S. Navy frigate, a ship twice Spencer's size, to safety. Spencer participated in the search for a missing Air National Guard paratrooper during the 1991 Perfect Storm. In 1999, Spencer was the on-scene command vessel for the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash off Nantucket, controlling both U.S. Navy and Coast Guard assets in the search and recovery efforts. Operational history During a law enforcement patrol in 1987, Spencer arrested 23 people and confiscated more than 46,000 pounds of marijuana from four smuggling vessels. While on a south patrol in 1989, Spencer rescued and repatriated 538 Haitian migrants bound for the United States, and later seized a Panamanian freighter laden with 438 kilograms of cocaine. In 1993, Spencer made the first planned deployment of a 270-foot cutter with an SH-60 helicopter. This ship/helicopter deployment was shortened so that Spencer could participate in the response to a mass exodus of Haitian migrants. Spencer was on-scene command for patrol boats conducting survivor/decedent recovery of the Feb. 1993 ferry sinking in the Gulf of Gonave. The ship rescued over 1700 Haitian migrants during this patrol, 544 of whom were rescued on a single day on July 4, 1993. Two months later, Spencer repatriated more than 200 Haitian migrants from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. During New York City's Annual Fleet Week of 1995, Spencer opened her brow to more than 5000 visitors. Spencer also carried several crew members from the World War II cutter of the same name in honor of Fleet Week's celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of that war. In early 1996, Spencer responded to the downed Alas Nacionales plane crash off the coastal waters of the Dominican Republic in which 188 people lost their lives. On April 22, 1997, Spencer seized 3905 pounds of cocaine off the coast of Honduras. When the fishing vessel Lady of Grace became disabled during a severe storm in November 1997, Spencer was there to save the crew and tow the vessel to safety. Recently, Spencer worked with the French warship Vent√¥se, to seize 1800 kilograms of pure cocaine off the coast of Venezuela.

The Court held that a step parent who is found to be in loco parentis cannot unilaterally withdraw from the family relationship.  Background  In 1991, Gerald Chartier married to Sharon Chartier, with whom he had been in a relationship since 1989, and with whom he had a daughter, Jeena, who was born a year prior. At the time of their marriage, Sharon also had a second daughter, Jessica, from a previous relationship.Chartier v. Chartier, 1 SCR 242 at para. 1 (LexUM). Gerald had helped care for the child and took on the role a father. The couple \\"discussed, but did not proceed with, the husband‚Äôs adoption of Jessica[,]\\" though they \\"did amend Jessica‚Äôs birth registration to indicate, falsely, that the husband was Jessica‚Äôs natural father and to change her name to his.\\"Ibid. at para. 2. In May of 1992, the couple separated, and did so permanently the following September after briefly reconciling. In March of 1994, a consent judgment under Manitoba's Family Maintenance Act determined that both daughters were \\"children of the marriage\\" and granted Gerald access to them. Though he consented to supporting Jeena, \\"the judgment was silent as to maintenance for Jessica and for the wife.\\"Ibid. at paras. 3-4. The Family Maintenance Act declares that \\"[s]pouses and common-law partners have the mutual obligation to contribute reasonably to each other's support and maintenance,\\" and that ‚Äì while former spouses should seek to become financially independent from one another following a separation ‚Äì it extends this obligation to support one's former partner following a separation under certain circumstances.Family Maintenance Act, C.C.S.M., c. F20, part 1. Sharon commenced divorce proceedings in February, 1995, at which time she applied for child support, requesting a declaration that Gerald \\"stood in the place of a parent to Jessica.\\" Gerald contested the claim, and argued that he had severed his in loco parentis role to Jessica, and therefore was not responsible for supporting the child. An interim order ruled Gerald pay child support to both daughters and suspended his access to them pending a report from Consiliation Services. That report, issued in October of that year, recorded Gerald's desire to sever his parental relationship with his step-daughter. A trial court ruled that Gerald pay spousal support to Sharon as well as reimburse her for her legal costs, while it reduced the amount of child support he was obligated to pay for the care of Jeena. Moreover, it denied Sharon's request that he pay child support for the care of Jennifer as well, finding that Gerald \\"had repudiated his parental relationship with Jessica.\\" Both parties appealed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal, which agreed to hear the case on the issue of the reduction of Gerald's monthly support to Jeena, denying his own appeal for review on the issue of his obligation to pay spousal support. The appellate court set aside the lower court's judgment that Gerald cover Sharon's legal fees, and denied Sharon's request that her ex-husband provide child support for the care of Jessica as well.Chartier v. Chartier, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 242 at paras. 5-6 (LexUM). Sharon subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which heard oral arguments in November of 1998.  Decision of the Supreme Court  Justice Bastarache, writing for a unanimous Court, held in favour of Sharon and stated that Gerald could not unilaterally sever ties to the child. To determine if a spouse is in the role of parent, the court must look at a number of factors including: * whether the child participates in the extended family in the same way as would a biological child; * whether the person provides financially for the child (depending on ability to pay); * whether the person disciplines the child as a parent; * whether the person represents to the child, the family, the world, either explicitly or implicitly, that he or she is responsible as a parent to the child; * the nature or existence of the child's relationship with the absent biological parent.

The United States National Memorial Arch, located in Valley Forge National Historical Park, Pennsylvania, is a monument built to celebrate the arrival of General George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. Valley Forge was the military camp 18 miles northwest of Philadelphia where the American Continental Army spent the winter of 1777‚Äì78 during the American Revolutionary War. Starvation, disease, malnutrition, and exposure killed more than 2,500 American soldiers by the end of February 1778. The arch is physically in Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County. // Compare with Overview The Memorial Arch was planned during the height of the post-Civil War memorial boom. During this period of around 50 years, many monuments were planned and built in the United States, many of which are on the National Mall. As a result, the architectural style of the Arch mirrors many of the monuments. The Memorial Arch is dedicated \\"to the officers and private soldiers of the Continental Army December 19, 1777 June 19, 1778\\". The Arch is situated at the top of a hill at the intersection of Gulph Road and Outer Line Drive in Valley Forge National Historical Park. The United States National Memorial Arch was designed by Paul Philippe Cret with hopes its styles would mirror a simplified version of the Triumphal Arch of Titus in Rome (marked the capture of Jerusalem by Emperor Titus in A.D. 70). Paul Philippe Cret was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and was originally from France, studying at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. In classical architecture, the triumphal arch was erected to honor generals and emperors. The United States National Memorial Arch does so by offering a national tribute to George Washington, and his army. The Arch stands at 60 feet tall. In 1907, the Valley Forge Park Commission planned the construction of two arches, the Washington Arch at the Valley Creek entrance, and a von Steuben Arch at the park entrance on the opposite end. Both arches were designed to serve as entrance gates to welcome park visitors as well as monuments honoring the two generals and their troops. In 1908, Congressman Irving P. Wanger introduced a bill to Congress to get funding for the two arches. The two arches were given a bill of $50,000 each, which was approved by the House of Representatives in March 1910, but failed in the Senate later that year. Instead, a bill for one arch was approved in October 1910 for $100,000. Funds were distributed in 1911, and construction began in 1914. The arch was formally dedicated to George Washington and his troops on June 19, 1917. When the National Memorial Arch was dedicated on June 19, 1917, patriotism in the U.S. was strong due to ongoing battles in World War 1 which engendered significant interest in the memorial. A train of Pullman cars brought members of Congress to Valley Forge on the day of the ceremony where they attached platforms with red-white-and-blue bunting in a celebration of patriotism. Pennsylvania Governor Martin Brumbaugh spoke of the spirit of Valley Forge and its importance during hard times. To ensure the arch was still in good health, a restoration project began in 1996 headed by the Freemasons of Pennsylvania. The project had a budget of $1.5 million and provided nine tons of stabilizing steel to ensure the monument was structurally sound. The restoration project ended in 1997. The Valley Forge Historical Park attracts 1 million yearly visitors, and the National Memorial Arch draws in 300,000 of these. The arch is currently maintained by the Valley Forge National Historical Park, one of 413 National Parks in the National Park Service. Inscriptions National Memorial Arch inscription: Naked and starving as they are We cannot enough admire The incomparable Patience and Fidelity of the Soldiery -George Washington The National Memorial Arch is inscribed in many locations. On the front of the memorial is a quote from George Washington's letter to Governor George Clinton while at Valley Forge. Naked and starving as they are We cannot enough admire The incomparable Patience and Fidelity of the Soldiery Located within the arch of the monument is a quote from a speech given by Henry Armitt Brown, an American writer and orator. Brown gave his speech at the 100 year anniversary of Valley Forge. And here in this place of sacrifice, in this vale of humiliation, in this valley of the shadow, of that death out of which, the life of America rose, regenerate and free, let us believe, with an abiding faith, that to them, union will seem as dear, and liberty as sweet, and progress as glorious, they were to our fathers, and are to you and me, and that the institutions, which have made us happy, preserved by the, virtue of our children, shall bless, the remotest generation, to the time to come Also located on the back of the monument are the last names of the American generals during the Revolutionary War.

It reflects the traditional Taiwanese style of glove puppetry known there as budaixi, supplemented by computer-generated imagery. Plot Throughout the storyline within this movie film, 400 years within the past is where it is meant to be taking place. The story begins when a man by the name of Mo Kuei threatens the people to the extent that he will destroy all of Wulin, which had been the forest of residence for the warriors of Wulin. A certain sage by the name of Su Huan-jen had responded to this conflict by summoning three specific warriors from different schools of martial arts to assist him. These three warriors would then wait within ambush for Mo Kuei to gather his spiritual energy amongst the summit of the mountain. The story continues onward in which Lord Jian almost becomes sealed by certain protectors of Wulin. Many conflicts follow this in which Jian loses all of his powers and lusts to find the Sacred Stone to regain his powers.

Huan-Jen was regularly referred to as White Lotus through his purity of mind and character. No matter how extreme of circumstances, Huan-Jen will always reflect calmness within his art of the sword and inner mind even when he consists of merely one arm. Huan-Jen is renowned for his excelled abilities with his sword. Huan-Jen also reflects various traits such as being clever within his tactics and rather wise. His ultimate goal is to restore Wulin to its former power even if it costs him his life in the process. Huan-Jen later vows to destroy Lord Jian after he sees his brother dead right before him. Ao Hsiao Hong-Chen: The primary subordinate character within Legend of the Sacred Stone. Hong-Chen had been an old friend of Lord Jian. The many unforeseen events within his life, such as his friend becoming rather distorted of mind has led for him to have no true desire towards political power. Through this, Hong-Chen has searched for many years towards a more pure way with the world. After some years had passed by, he soon became rather obsessed with spiritual power, and a rather strong sense of justice. However, Hong-Chen can act impulsively at times when his sense of justice is challenged in any type of way. It is noted that Hong-Chen is even a greater swordsman than that of Su Huan-Jen which was proved through a certain serious duel to the death between each other. Ching Yang-Zi: A very close friend to that of Su Huan-Jen. He is always with Huan-Jen, and they regularly call each other brothers due to their closeness. Yang-Zi possesses a certain unique ability with the harp weapon, in which he can transmit spiritual power and use at will within battle. It is also known that Yang-Zi is brave of heart and is a rather noted gentleman. At one time within the story, Yang-Zi attempts to flee with Ru-Bing in hopes of escaping the demon allies of Lord Jian. After Yang-Zi is severely wounded and near death, he had kept continuing to protect Ru-Bing for the sake of his brother. However, after he made a secure rout of escape for Ru-Bing, he would see his last against three specific demons, in which he had violently unleashed his powers amongst the melee. Yang-Zi however was dealt the final slash by the enemy, in which he stood alone with blood rushing forth from his body, never to wake again. Jian Ru-Bing: A rather beautiful woman who had been well known as the daughter of Lord Jian. Ru-Bing is daily forced to carry around her father's hatred towards their past village. Ru-Bing's actions, which are partially driven through fear, result in her acting in any way that complies with her father. Ru-Bing even went to the extent as to attempt to retrieve the Sacred Stone from Hell's Valley to restore her father's face, and spiritual power. Ru-Bing is also the secret love of Su Huan-Jen. In the end however, Ru-Bing sadly sacrifices her life to the Sacred Stone so that her father can become restored. This is because the Sacred Stone requires an equal sacrifice to attain a greater goal. Lord Jian: The primary villain within the Legend of the Sacred Stone, and father of Ru-Bing. Jian had at one time been noted as a kind man of noble descent, even to the extent that he was known as the \\"Great Protector\\". Later however, his younger brother would find a certain artifact known as the Sacred Stone, which caused many demons to attack him (in which is where his face became ruined) and to have his whole family slaughtered. This caused for a large distortion within Jian, leading for him to possess an immense blood lust. Jian will stop at nothing to fin the Sacred Stone for revenge, even if it costs him being sealed away or killed. Jian's hatred leads for him to become enemies with the warriors of Wulin, even leading for many to be recruited to act against him. His ultimate goal is to restore his face and attain unlimited power, even if it costs his daughter's death. In the end however, his daughter is sacrificed, and he is finally defeated after a long battle against both Su Huan-Jen and Hsiao Hong-Chen. Jian Wei: The sworn protector of Lord Jian. Jian Wei had served as Jian's protector even at a young age, and will continue to serve him even if he had become distorted of mind. However, Jian Wei still wishes for Lord Jian to return to his old self and will stop at nothing to see his true master's self again. Later within the story, Jian Wei runs away with Ru-Bing when he acquires the Sacred Stone, as to save Lord Jian from his ambition. Jian later catches up with Jian Wei and slays him without a second thought. Technique The techniques used in Legend of the Sacred Stone and the Pili TV series are glove puppetry, CG animation, and wires are sometimes used when characters are fighting to flip them around in the air. Unlike other hand puppets, budaixi puppets have legs. DVD versions There are two versions of the film on DVD - the uncut 120-minute version from Taiwan, which has no English subtitles, and the truncated 99-minute version from Japan, with English subtitles. The Japanese DVDs advertise a \\"129-minute\\" running time, but this includes the special features.

Human Science aims to expand our understanding of the human world through a broad interdisciplinary approach. It encompasses a wide range of fields - including history, philosophy, genetics, sociology, psychology, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, neurosciences, folkloristics, and anthropology. It is the study and interpretation of the experiences, activities, constructs, and artifacts associated with human beings. The study of the human sciences attempts to expand and enlighten the human being's knowledge of their existence, its interrelationship with other species and systems, and the development of artifacts to perpetuate the human expression and thought. It is the study of human phenomena. The study of the human experience is historical and current in nature. It requires the evaluation and interpretation of the historic human experience and the analysis of current human activity to gain an understanding of human phenomena and to project the outlines of human evolution. Human science is the objective, informed critique of human existence and how it relates to reality. Meaning of 'science' Ambiguity and confusion regarding usage of the terms 'science', 'empirical science', and 'scientific method' have complicated the usage of the term 'human science' with respect to human activities. The term 'science' is derived from the Latin scientia meaning 'knowledge'. 'Science' may be appropriately used to refer to any branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged to show the operation of general laws. However, according to positivists, the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge which comes from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific method, the application of knowledge or mathematics. As a result of the positivist influence, the term science is frequently employed as a synonym for empirical science. Empirical science is knowledge based on the scientific method, a systematic approach to verification of knowledge first developed for dealing with natural physical phenomena and emphasizing the importance of experience based on sensory observation. However, even with regard to the natural sciences, significant difference exist among scientists and philosophers of science with regard to what constitutes valid scientific methodPopper, Karl, Logic of Scientific Discovery, Routledge, 2002.‚Äîfor example, evolutionary biology, geology and astronomy, studying events that cannot be repeated, can use a method of historical narratives.Mayr, Ernst. Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought. More recently, usage of the term has been extended to the study of human social phenomena. Thus, natural and social sciences are commonly classified as science, whereas the study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts are referred to as the humanities. Ambiguity with respect to the meaning of the term science is aggravated by the widespread use of the term formal science with reference to any one of several sciences that is predominantly concerned with abstract form that cannot be validated by physical experience through the senses, such as logic, mathematics, and the theoretical branches of computer science, information theory, and statistics. History The phrase 'human science' in English was used during the 17th- century scientific revolution, for example by Theophilus Gale, to draw a distinction between supernatural knowledge (divine science) and study by humans (human science). John Locke also uses 'human science' to mean knowledge produced by people, but without the distinction. By the 20th century, this latter meaning was used at the same time as 'sciences that make human beings the topic of research'. Human science (also, human sciences, humanistic social science, moral science, and moral sciences) refers to the investigation of human life and activities via an interdisciplinary framework spanning the sciences and humanities. Underlying Human science is the relationship between various humanistic modes of inquiry within fields such as, history, sociology, folkloristics, anthropology and economics, and advances in such things as genetics, evolutionary biology and the social sciences for the purpose of understanding our lives in a rapidly changing world. Its use of an empirical methodology that encompasses psychological experience contrasts to the purely positivistic approach typical of the natural sciences which exclude all methods not based solely on sensory observations. Modern approaches in the human sciences integrate an understanding of human structure, function and adaptation with a broader exploration of what it means to be human. The term is also used to distinguish not only the content of a field of study from those of the natural sciences, but also its methodology.Georg Henrik von Wright, Explanation and Understanding, , pp. 4‚Äì7 =Early development= The term moral science was used by David Hume (1711-1776) in his Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals to refer to the systematic study of human nature and relationships. Hume wished to establish a \\"science of human nature\\" based upon empirical phenomena, and excluding all that does not arise from observation. Rejecting teleological, theological and metaphysical explanations, Hume sought to develop an essentially descriptive methodology; phenomena were to be precisely characterized. He emphasized the necessity of carefully explicating the cognitive content of ideas and vocabulary, relating these to their empirical roots and real-world significance.\\"David Hume\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy A variety of early thinkers in the humanistic sciences took up Hume's direction. Adam Smith, for example, conceived of economics as a moral science in the Humean sense.Book Review of Jeffrey T. Young's Economics As a Moral Science: The Political Economy of Adam Smith =Later development= Partly in reaction to the establishment of positivist philosophy and the latter's Comtean intrusions into traditionally humanistic areas such as sociology, non-postivistic researchers in the humanistic sciences began to carefully but emphatically distinguish the methodological approach appropriate to these areas of study, for which the unique and distinguishing characteristics of phenomena are in the forefront (e.g. for the biographer), from that appropriate to the natural sciences, for which the ability to link phenomena into generalized groups is foremost. In this sense, Johann Gustav Droysen contrasted the humanistic science's need to comprehend the phenomena under consideration with natural science's need to explain phenomena, while Windelband coined the terms idiographic for a descriptive study of the individual nature of phenomena, and nomothetic for sciences that aim to define the generalizing laws. Wilhelm Dilthey brought nineteenth-century attempts to formulate a methodology appropriate to the humanistic sciences together with Hume's term \\"moral science\\", which he translated as Geisteswissenschaft - a term with no exact English equivalent. Dilthey attempted to articulate the entire range of the moral sciences in a comprehensive and systematic way.Wilhelm Dilthey, An Introduction to the Human Sciences, Princeton Press Meanwhile, his conception of ‚ÄúGeisteswissenschaften‚Äù encompasses also the abovementioned study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts. He characterized the scientific nature of a study as depending upon: * The conviction that perception gives access to reality * The self-evident nature of logical reasoning * The principle of sufficient reason But the specific nature of the Geisteswissenschaften is based on the \\"inner\\" experience (Erleben), the \\"comprehension\\" (Verstehen) of the meaning of expressions and \\"understanding\\" in terms of the relations of the part and the whole ‚Äì in contrast to the Naturwissenschaften, the \\"explanation\\" of phenomena by hypothetical laws in the \\"natural sciences\\".Wilhelm Dilthey, Gesammelte Schriften, vol. VII Edmund Husserl, a student of Franz Brentano, articulated his phenomenological philosophy in a way that could be thought as a basis of Dilthey's attempt. Dilthey appreciated Husserl's Logische UntersuchungenEdmund Husserl, Logical Investigations, 1973 [1913], Findlay, J. N., trans. London: Routledge (1900/1901, the first draft of Husserl's Phenomenology) as an ‚Äúepoch making‚Äú epistemological foundation of his conception of Geisteswissenschaften. In recent years, 'human science' has been used to refer to \\"a philosophy and approach to science that seeks to understand human experience in deeply subjective, personal, historical, contextual, cross-cultural, political, and spiritual terms. Human science is the science of qualities rather than of quantities and closes the subject-object split in science. In particular, it addresses the ways in which self-reflection, art, music, poetry, drama, language and imagery reveal the human condition. By being interpretive, reflective, and appreciative, human science re-opens the conversation among science, art, and philosophy.\\" Objective vs. subjective experiences Since Auguste Comte, the positivistic social sciences have sought to imitate the approach of the natural sciences by emphasizing the importance of objective external observations and searching for universal laws whose operation is predicated on external initial conditions that do not take into account differences in subjective human perception and attitude. Critics argue that subjective human experience and intention plays such a central role in determining human social behavior that an objective approach to the social sciences is too confining. Rejecting the positivist influence, they argue that the scientific method can rightly be applied to subjective, as well as objective, experience. The term subjective is used in this context to refer to inner psychological experience rather than outer sensory experience. It is not used in the sense of being prejudiced by personal motives or beliefs. Human science in universities Since 1878, the University of Cambridge has been home to the Moral Sciences Club, with strong ties to analytic philosophy. The Human Science degree is relatively young. It has been a degree subject at Oxford since 1969. At University College London, it was proposed in 1973 by Professor J. Z. Young and implemented two years later. His aim was to train general science graduates who would be scientifically literate, numerate and easily able to communicate across a wide range of disciplines, replacing the traditional Classics training for higher-level government and management careers. Central topics include the evolution of humans, their behaviour, molecular and population genetics, population growth and ageing, ethnic and cultural diversity and the human interaction with the environment, including conservation, disease and nutrition. The study of both biological and social disciplines, integrated within a framework of human diversity and sustainability, should enable the human scientist to develop professional competencies suited to address such multidimensional human problems. In the United Kingdom, Human Science is offered at degree level at several institutions, these include: * University of Oxford * University College London (as Human Sciences and as Human Sciences and Evolution) * King's College London (as Anatomy, Developmental & Human Biology) * University of Exeter * Durham University (as Health and Human Sciences) * Cardiff University (as Human and Social Sciences) * Osaka University Human Science Lab The Human Science Lab (HSL) is a global centre for world-leading research on evolutionary, biological and behavioural aspect of human species. It is located in Oxfordshire and London. Its current research focus are human cognition, motivation, intelligence, leadership, critical thinking, learning, ergonomics and human well-being. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach for most of its research incorporating neuroscience, anthropology, psychology, evolutionary biology, genetics, and physiology.

Tingmissartoq means \\"one who flies like a big bird\\"; the plane was thus christened by an Inuit boy in Godthaab (Nuuk), Greenland, who painted the word on its side. First flight Lockheed had introduced its Sirius model in 1929; this particular craft appears to have been built to specifications sometime between then and 1931, when the Lindberghs planned to fly to the Orient via the Great Circle Route. A low-wing monoplane, Tingmissartoq was outfitted with Edo floats, as much of the planned route was over water. The trip was described solely as a vacation flight, with \\"no start or finish, no diplomatic or commercial significance, and no records to be sought.Lockheed 8 Sirius \\" It began in North Haven, Maine, from which point the couple flew to Ottawa. From there they flew to various other sites in Canada, including Moose Factory, Churchill, Baker Lake, and Aklavik, before heading to Point Barrow, Alaska. They continued on to Shismaref and Nome, after which they crossed the Pacific Ocean to Petropavlosk. From here they continued over the Kuril Islands to Tokyo, where they were enthusiastically welcomed. The trip continued on to China, with its final stop on Lotus Lake near Nanking made on September 19. Anne Morrow Lindbergh described the trip, and her impressions and experiences, in her book North to the Orient. Accident at Hankow While at Hankow, the plane, with the Lindberghs aboard, was being lowered into the Yangtze River from the British aircraft carrier when it capsized accidentally. One wing hit a ship's cable and was damaged, necessitating the craft's return to the United States for repairs. Second journey Tingmissartoq was to see action again in 1933 as a result of international interest in the development of commercial air transport. Pan American Airways, Imperial Airways, Deutsche Luft Hansa, KLM, and Air France collaborated on a study of international air routes. The assigned areas were Newfoundland to Europe via Greenland; Newfoundland via the great circle route to Ireland; Newfoundland southeast to the Azores and Lisbon; Miami, Bermuda, the Azores, and Lisbon; and across the South Atlantic from Brazil, to Cape Verde. Pan American was given the responsibility for the first of these, and sent Lindbergh, as the company's technical advisor, to survey the route. Accompanied once more by Anne, he took off from New York City on July 9 in the rebuilt craft. The purpose of the trip was to gain as much data as possible on the area to be covered. The plane had been fitted with a Sperry artificial horizon and a directional gyro since its previous flight. The engine, too, was new, a Wright Cyclone SR1820-F2 of 710 hp. All possible spaces were used, including the wings and floats; these contained the gasoline tanks. There was also plenty of emergency equipment for use in the event of a forced landing. To maintain radio contact with the couple, Pan American hired a Danish ship, the Jellinge, to stay within range in the area of Labrador, Greenland, and Iceland. It also delivered advance supplies for them to Halifax, St. John's, Cartwright, Greenland, and Iceland. Tingmissartoq flew first from New York to Hopedale, Labrador, hugging the eastern Canada‚ÄìUS border along the way. From here the Lindberghs made the first major hop over water, flying 650 miles to Godthaab. The couple then crisscrossed Greenland to Baffin Island and back, and then flew to Iceland. They continued the trip by flying around the world; visiting first the major cities of Europe, they continued to Moscow, then down Africa's west coast, and across the South Atlantic to South America. Here, they flew down the Amazon River, and then turned north through Trinidad and Barbados before returning to the United States. They returned to New York on December 19, having traveled 30,000 miles and visited four continents and twenty-one countries. The information they provided proved invaluable in planning transatlantic air transport routes. Tingmissartoq was on display in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City until 1955, when it was acquired by the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. It was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959, and is currently on display in the \\"Pioneers of Flight\\" gallery of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

Mary quickly moved up the amateur ranks in 2003 and soon became a professional figure competitor in 2004 by winning NPC National Figure Championships. Today Lado is one of the top figure competitors in the Industry, winning the Ms. Figure International on two consecutive occasions and placing in the top-five at the Ms. Figure Olympia on two occasions. Biography Mary Lado was born in New Orleans, Louisiana is a professional figure competitor. Lado was raised amid Spanish culture; her mother, Marianela, was born in Cuba and her father, Jose, in Spain. The oldest of three, Mary along with her two brothers, Jose and Carlos were raised to be active, well-mannered individuals, who go after their dreams and work hard to achieve them. She still lives at her home state of Louisiana near her friends in a close-knit family. At an early age her parents encouraged her daughter to get involved in sports. Even as a child Lado was a naturally competitive child in different fields such as sports. In high school, Lado was on the volleyball, basketball, softball and track teams. This competitive fire helped her in her education; excelling in volleyball and softball, she received a full four-year scholarship to attend Chipola Junior College in Marianna, Florida as a pitcher, and then to Georgia Southwestern State University to play Softball. There she majored in sociology, and while she treasured her education, she felt uncomfortable studying and having to do homework was not a very enjoyable activity for her during her college years. After graduation Lado felt that she needed something to do in order to deal with her competitive energy since school was over and she had no sports nor people to play sports with. She toyed with free weights to stay active, when she was encouraged by relatives in the gym to compete in figure competitions. In 2003, after six months of hard training, she entered her first NPC figure contest, the New Orleans Figure Championships, and won her height class. In 2004, she came in second in the NPC Junior Nationals in her height class and won the figure overall title at the Nationals, catapulting her into the pros. In 2005, Lado entered five pro figure contests, winning the Pittsburgh Pro Figure Championships and the California Pro Figure Championships. Everything was going well at the professional level for Lado, but soon she would find herself with some personal issues that began to take their toll on her competitive career. While visiting family in Spain her hometown was hit by Hurricane Katrina. Unable to community with her family members in Louisiana for more than a week after her the disaster, Mary was in a serious emotional turmoil and for sometime thought of not attending the 2005 Ms. Figure Olympia contest (her first Olympia). But she then decided to the Olympia after being able to talk to her family in Louisiana. Unable to find adequate gyms in Spain, and only relying on Theraband exercise and outdoor cardio sessions to prepare for the Olympia contest. After returning to Louisiana, she stayed with some friends and continued her last few preparations for the contest. And while she was not in her best condition she managed to place 4th at the Sacramento Pro Figure, and 5th Figure Olympia (her last two competitions of 2005). During this time Lado asked some of the judges and professional figure competitors about what she needed to do to improve her performance on stage as well as other areas that she needed work on in order to be more competitive at the pro level. She was told that she needed more stage presence and needed to work at her conditioning as well. Mary put her newfound knowledge to work and began her preparations for the 2006 Arnold Classic, where she placed 1st. Her crowning achievement to date came at this year's Arnold Fitness Weekend, she became the only athlete besides Jenny Lynn to hold the Figure International title, in total Lado has won the title twice.

Located on Ontario Highway 7, which is the Trans-Canada Highway, Omemee is one of the major communities in the Kawartha Lakes, as the proclaimed \\"city\\" is vastly rural and has but one major population centre. The community had a population of 1,247 in the Canada 2011 Census. It is located between the city of Peterborough and the community of Lindsay. Lindsay is the largest population centre in the city of Kawartha Lakes, and serves as the administrative centre as it did with Victoria County. Omemee was the early childhood home of musician Neil Young, and of his father, author and sportswriter Scott Young. In late 2014 Omemee‚Äôs Youngtown museum closed for good, and shipped its content to neighbouring town Lindsay for display. August 2016 Omemee was featured on Canadian comedian Jonny Harris‚Äô CBC Still Standing program. Filmed at Thanksgiving the year prior, in the town's city hall, the episode focused on Neil Young and his childhood friend, taking rifle shooting lessons from the town doctor and going adventure diving in a swimming pool. History The community that grew up around William Cottingham's mills on the Pigeon River was first called Williamstown and then Metcalfe. In 1857 the community was renamed Omemee, for the Omemee tribe, which once hunted in the area. The word means pigeon in the Mississauga language. The construction of the Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton Railway in 1857 (when the town also acquired a post office) fostered the growth of the community, which became a thriving shipping point for timber and grain. Until the 1860s, Omemee competed with Lindsay as the largest town in Victoria County. At its zenith in the late 1800s, Omemee had a grist mill, two sawmills, a tannery, a foundry, a shingle mill, a cloth mill, three churches, four hotels, an elementary and secondary school, and a newspaper. As Ontario‚Äôs economy shifted away from agriculture and surrounding towns grew, the industrial section of Omemee declined until, 100 years later, only the Regal Stationery Company remained (the factory has since closed). Today, Omemee‚Äôs economy is supported by the town‚Äôs population as well as seasonal residents and retirement communities in the surrounding area. Education Omemee has two public schools: Lady Eaton Elementary (kindergarten to grade 3), and Scott Young (grades 4 to 8). Scott Young Public School was named after Scott Young, a journalist and author of many books, and father of musician Neil Young. In 2015 due to enrolment decline in Scott Young Middle school, ‚Äúto the point where both schools were below 50 per cent Ministry of Education identified capacity‚Äù, the Trillium Lakelands District School Board moved the overflow of grade 4‚Äôs from Lady Eaton over to Scott Young. Then in late 2016 it was announced that Lady Eaton Elementary school will close for good in June 2018. Though Lady Eaton is to be closed, there are plans to keep the daycare open to the public: ‚Äúthe board [can] work with the Omemee Children‚Äôs Centre in the hopes of moving the daycare to Scott Young‚Äù. Legacy The ghost town of Omemee, North Dakota, was named after the Ontario Omemee, as the former's first post master hailed from the latter. In 1970, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young released D√©j√† Vu with a recording of the song \\"Helpless\\" which was based on Neil Young's hometown Omemee, referring to the town in the first verse as, ‚ÄúThere is a town in north Ontario...All my changes were there‚Äù.

She is the subject of the 1986 film Sarraounia based on the novel of the same name by Nigerien writer Abdoulaye Mamani.  Biography  Sarraounia means queen or female chief in the Hausa language. Among the predominately animist Azna people of Lougou and surrounding Hausa towns and villages, the term refers to a lineage of female rulers who exercised both political and religious power. Sarraounia Mangou was the most famous of the Sarraounias due to her resistance against French colonial troops at the Battle of Lougou in 1899. While most chiefs in Niger pragmatically submitted to French power, Sarraounia Mangou mobilized her people and resources to confront the French forces of the Voulet‚ÄìChanoine Mission, which launched a fierce attack on her fortress capital of Lougou. Overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the French, she and her fighters retreated from the fortress, and engaged the attackers in a protracted guerrilla battle which eventually forced the French to abandon their project of subduing her. The 1986 film Sarraounia is a retelling of her struggle against Voulet and Chanoine's troops.

He is also an accomplished poet and TV scriptwriter. Life and career The middle son of a Presbyterian minister, Hugh Fraser McDonald, 1909‚Äì81, and the Central Queensland historian, Dr Lorna McDonald, 1916-2017, his childhood was spent in the NSW country towns of Bribbaree, Temora, and Bourke, before the family moved to Sydney. He attended The Scots College and the University of Sydney. He was briefly a teacher, ABC producer, and publisher's editor in NSW, Tasmania, and Queensland, before moving to Canberra and taking up writing full-time in 1976, in order to complete his first novel, 1915. McDonald has since 1980 lived near Braidwood, NSW, apart from periods in Sydney and New Zealand. His novels are 1915, Slipstream, Rough Wallaby, Water Man, The Slap, Mr Darwin's Shooter, The Ballad of Desmond Kale, When Colts Ran, The Following and A Sea-Chase. Non-fiction: Shearers' Motel and The Tree In Changing Light. 1915 won The Age Book of the Year in 1979 and the South Australian Biennial Literature Prize in 1980. In 1982 it was made into a seven-part ABC-TV television series. (Scripting: Peter Yeldham) Shearers' Motel won the 1993 Banjo National Book Council Banjo Award for non-fiction. It was filmed as \\"Cross Turning Over\\" for ABC-TV in 1996 (Director: Robert Klenner) McDonald was nominated for the Miles Franklin Award in 1994 for Water Man, and in 1999 for Mr Darwin's Shooter, which in that year won the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, the Victorian Premier's Literary Award, the South Australian Premier's Awards, and the Adelaide Festival Book of the Year. The Ballad of Desmond Kale won the Miles Franklin Award in 2006 and the Adelaide Festival Prize for Fiction in 2008. McDonald won the O. Henry Award in 2008 for \\"The Bullock Run\\" (USA). This story forms the basis of chapters 15 and 16 of When Colts Ran. McDonald's eighth novel, When Colts Ran, 2010, was shortlisted for the 2011 Miles Franklin Award, the 2011 Victorian Premier's Prize for Fiction, and the 2011 Prime Minister's Literary Award for Fiction. His ninth novel, The Following, was published in 2013. A fictionalised reimagining of the life of Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley, the story centres on the rise to prominence and legacy of Marcus Friendly. Of the book, Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Daniel Herborn wrote: 'The Following is just as interested in the sweep of history as in those who are caught up in, and occasionally influence, the great social changes it surveys. Its themes of destiny, sectarianism and political patronage echo across generations as the influence of Friendly rises and wanes.' His tenth novel, A Sea-Chase was published in October 2017. The book follows the fortunes of young teacher Judy Compton. After fleeing a rioting classroom one dismal Friday, she gets drunk and wakes up on a boat. Overnight her life changes; she is in love with being on the water and in love with Wes Bannister. But then events at sea challenge everything she holds dearest...

Both highways are major east-west arteries in Morris County, New Jersey, and both are also lined with businesses and strip malls. Consequently Route 10 and US 46 experience heavy daily use, especially during the rush hours and on the weekends.History of Roxbury Township, Morris County, New Jersey NJ This intersection is also the western terminus of Route 10.New Jersey Department of Transportation  Replacing the Ledgewood Circle  In the mid 1990s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation dismantled the Ledgewood Circle and reconfigured the two highways into a signalized T-intersection. Before the circle was replaced, eastbound traffic on US 46 had to travel almost three- quarters of the way around the circle (while contending with traffic merging on to US 46 east and west from Route 10 west) in order to continue traveling on US 46 east. Travelers on U.S. Route 46 west wishing to travel on Route 10 east also had to go almost three-quarters of the way around the circle with the same merging traffic to reach Route 10 eastbound. There were traffic metering signals to provide gaps in traffic so that motorists could in theory move in and out of the circle safely, but these signals were overwhelmed by the volume of daily traffic entering and exiting the circle and were not effective. Speeding around the circle was a hazard as well because the roadway was broad and the circle itself had a large diameter, allowing those who wished to travel at highway speeds (50‚Äì55 m.p.h.) to do so even though these speeds were significantly higher than the advisory speed of . This was the cause of many serious automobile accidents at the circle and another reason that the circle was replaced. Since replacement Since the circle has been replaced, traffic approaching the former circle from the west while moving eastbound on U.S. Route 46 uses a new roadway that cuts through the middle of the former circle. Traffic must then use two dedicated left turn lanes governed by a signal to turn onto the original alignment of US 46 eastbound. Motorists wishing to travel on Route 10 eastbound maintain their travel lanes as those lanes become Route 10 eastbound. There is a signal for these lanes too, it stops eastbound traffic to allow for U-turns and westbound US 46 traffic to make a left turn onto eastbound Route 10. Traffic on US 46 westbound merges on to a new two lane roadway that occupies the former south- western roadway of the old circle. Traffic is governed by a signal which permits westbound US 46 traffic to merge on to the original divided highway that carried U.S. Route 46 west from the circle. Westbound travellers wishing to make a left turn onto Route 10 eastbound bear left from US.S. Route 46 westbound before this merge and use dedicated left turn lanes to make this move. Traffic on Route 10 westbound wishing to travel onto U.S. Route 46 eastbound merge right at the terminus of Route 10 and travel onto the original alignment of US 46 eastbound. There is no signal for this traffic and it must yield to on coming traffic. Travelers on Route 10 westbound wishing to use US 46 westbound maintain their travel lanes and merge onto the original US 46 westbound divided highway via a new roadway built through the middle of the old Ledgewood Circle. These lanes are governed by a traffic signal which allows for U-turns and U.S. Route 46 eastbound traffic to make a left turn to continue on US 46 eastbound. While the intersection is more heavily used than ever, traffic moves through much more safely and fluidly with this new alignment.The Circle Tree controversy European beech tree blooms on Ledgewood Circle in Spring 1994 A purple European beech tree grew in the former Ledgewood Circle. The tree was going to be destroyed during the replacement project, and as a result a grass-roots effort was taken up by local residents, led by Marion Whitescarver beginning in 1994, to save the tree. Philip Amsterdam, president of the Marsellis Warner Corp., who was hired to eliminate the Ledgewood Circle, offered to move the tree at no cost to the township. He was told that tree experts hired by the municipality said it wouldn't be feasible to move it, as they determined the tree sat in a morass of rocks and boulders, making it impossible to dig under. The New Jersey Department of Transportation agreed that the tree needed to come down. On November 20, 1997, the tree was given a one-day reprieve to consider opposition to cutting down the tree. Construction was halted to consider Amsterdam's offer. The township was not persuaded to delay construction to remove the tree for replanting, which would have required colder temperatures to ensure a frozen root ball, and the tree was cut down on November 21, 1997.

A bad quarto, in Shakespearean scholarship, is a quarto-sized printed edition of one of Shakespeare's plays that is considered to be unauthorised, and is theorised to have been pirated from a theatrical performance without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or, alternatively, written down later from memory by an actor or group of actors in the cast ‚Äì the latter process has been termed \\"memorial reconstruction\\". Since the quarto derives from a performance, hence lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to be \\"bad\\", i.e. to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings.Jenkins, Harold. \\"Introduction\\".

CUP Archive (1941). pp. 1-4 In contrast, a \\"good quarto\\" is considered to be a text that is authorised and which may have been printed from the author's manuscript (or a working draft thereof, known as his foul papers), or from a scribal copy or prompt copy derived from the manuscript or foul papers.Duthie, George Ian. \\"Introduction; the good and bad quartos\\". The Bad Quarto of Hamlet. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 5-9 The concept of the bad quarto originates in 1909, attributed to A W Pollard and W W Gregg. The theory defines as \\"bad quartos\\" the first quarto printings of Romeo and Juliet, Henry V, The Merry Wives of Windsor and Hamlet, and seeks to explain why there are substantial textual differences between those quartos and the 1623 printing of the first folio edition of the plays. The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's The Battle of Alcazar, Greene's Orlando Furioso, and the collaborative script, Sir Thomas More.Erne, Lukas. Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist. Cambridge University Press. (2013) p. 223Maguire, Laurie E. Shakespearean Suspect Texts: The 'Bad' Quartos and Their Contexts.

Jonathan Bate states that \\"late twentieth- and early twenty-first century scholars have begun to question the whole edifice\\".Bate, Jonathan. \\"The Case for the Folio\\". (2007) Playshakespeare.com Origins of bad quarto theory The concept of the \\"bad quarto\\" as a category of text was created by bibliographer Alfred W. Pollard in his book Shakespeare Folios and Quartos (1909). The idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, which appears at the beginning of Shakespeare's First Folio and is titled, \\"To the Great Variety of Readers\\". Heminges and Condell refer to \\"diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies\\" of the plays. Up until 1909, it had been thought that the reference to stolen copies was a general reference to all quarto editions of the plays. Pollard, however, claimed that Heminges and Condell meant to refer only to \\"bad\\" quartos (as defined by himself), and Pollard listed as \\"bad\\" the first quartos of Romeo and Juliet (1597), Henry V (1600), The Merry Wives of Windsor (1602), Hamlet (1603), and Pericles (1609). Pollard pointed out that not only do these five texts contain \\"badness\\" (namely significant textual errors and corruptions), but also that there is (legal) \\"badness\\" in those who pirated them.De Grazia, Margreta. \\"The essential Shakespeare and the material book.\\" Orgel, Stephe and others, editors. Shakespeare and the Literary Tradition. Courier Corporation (1999) , p. 51. Scholar W. W. Greg worked closely with Pollard and published the bad quarto of The Merry Wives of Windsor,Greg, W. W. editor. Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor, 1602. Oxford; At the Clarendon Press (1910) which is a work that is significant in the history of the \\"bad quarto\\" theory. Greg described how the text may have been copied, and he identified the actor who played the role of \\"Host\\" as the culprit. Greg called the process that the actor may have used \\"memorial reconstruction\\", a phrase later used by other scholarsPollard, Alfred W. Shakespeare folios and quartos: a study in the bibliography of Shakespeare's plays, 1594‚Äì1685. University of Michigan Library (1909)Erne, Lukas. Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist. Cambridge University Press (2013) . p. 221 ‚Äì meaning, literally, a reconstruction of it from memory. Comparison of the \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet For Shakespeare, the First Folio of 1623 is the crucial document; of the 36 plays contained in that collection, 18 have no other source. The other 18 plays had been printed in quarto form at least once between 1594 and 1623, but since the prefatory matter in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts, which are termed \\"stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors\\", 18th- and 19th-century editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio. It was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented shorthand reporting, a practice mentioned by Thomas Heywood in the Prologue to his 1605 play If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody; reporters would surreptitiously take down a play's text in shorthand during a performance and pirate a popular play for a competing interest. However, Greg and R.C.Rhodes argued instead for an alternative theory: since some of the minor speeches varied less (from the folio text) than those of major characters, their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had reconstructed the play texts from memory and thereby gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played, but a less correct report of the other actors' parts. The idea caught on among Shakespearean scholars. Peter Alexander added The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster (1594) and The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York (1595) ‚Äì the earliest versions of Henry VI, Part 2 and Henry VI, Part 3 ‚Äì to the roster of bad quartos; both had been previously thought to be source plays for Shakespeare's later versions of the same histories. The concept of the bad quarto was then extended to play texts by authors other than Shakespeare, and by the second half of the 20th century the idea was being widely adopted.Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, p. 49. However, by the end of the century dissenting views had been published, such as the work of Laurie Maguire, then at the University of Ottawa. Criticism and alternative hypotheses Various problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis, particularly concerning the notion of memorial reconstruction. Furthermore, the hypothesis makes no allowance for changes to occur in the text across the enormous period between 1594 and 1623 (almost thirty years), from revisions by the author, abridgements for special circumstances, or natural evolution resulting from improvements to the text made by the actors in performance. For some plays, critics seem undecided even as to what amounts to a bad quarto. The first quarto of Richard III, for instance, is often now termed a bad quarto, \\"even though it is an unusually 'good' bad quarto\\".Evans, Riverside Shakespeare, p.754. Alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays he studied, which possessed problematical features that could not be explained, and in the end retreated to arguing, instead, that the quartos of the two early histories were \\"partial\\" memorial reconstructions. Some critics, including Eric Sams and Hardin Craig, dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that, unlike shorthand reporting, no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory. They believe that memorial reconstruction is a modern fiction. Individual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts, such as revision or abridgement by the author. Steven Urkowitz argued the hypothesis that King Lear is a revised work, in Shakespeare's Revision of \\"King Lear\\". Some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the Shakespearean canon, such as All's Well That Ends Well and Troilus and Cressida, make sense as works that Shakespeare wrote in the earliest, rawest stage of his career and later revised with more sophisticated additions. Steven Roy Miller considers a revision hypothesis, in preference to a bad-quarto hypothesis, for The Taming of a Shrew, the alternative version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew.Miller, pp.6‚Äì33. Robert Burkhart's 1975 study Shakespeare's Bad Quartos: Deliberate Abridgements Designed for Performance by a Reduced Cast provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction. Other studies have also questioned the \\"orthodox view\\" on bad quartos, as in David Farley-Hills's work on Romeo and Juliet. Maguire study In 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a studyMaguire, L. Shakespeare's Suspect Texts: the 'Bad' Quartos and their context Cambridge Univ Press (1996) of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the BBC TV Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. She found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. But the larger-scale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but a few of the bad quartos. The study uncovered only limited circumstantial evidence suggestive of possible memorial reconstruction, in the bad quartos of Hamlet, The Merry Wives of Windsor and Pericles. In fact, according to Maguire, virtually all the so-called bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts, which \\"merit our attention as valid texts in their own right\\".Quoted in The Sunday Telegraph, 17 March 1996, p. 12 This challenges the entire concept of bad quartos as pirated editions, mired in textual corruption; and presents them, rather, as earlier versions of the plays printed in the 1623 folio. Of other playwrights Though the bad quarto concept originated in reference to Shakespearean texts, scholars have also applied it to non-Shakespearean play texts of the English Renaissance era. In 1938, Leo Kirschbaum published \\"A Census of Bad Quartos\\" and included 20 play texts.Maguire, pp. 85‚Äì6. Maguire's 1996 study examined 41 Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos, including the first editions of Arden of Feversham, The Merry Devil of Edmonton and Fair Em, plays of the Shakespeare Apocrypha; plus George Chapman's The Blind Beggar of Alexandria; Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus and The Massacre at Paris; Part 1 of Heywood's If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody; and Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy.Maguire, pp. 227‚Äì321.

For the 2011-2012 school year, the Flint Community Schools had both middle schools, four elementary schools and one high school placed in the bottom 5% of all schools in the State of Michigan based on student achievement and attendance. The school district accommodated a total student population of about 30,000 students. It included two early childhood education centers, 18 elementary schools, and three secondary schools.  History  The current mission statement of \\"developing a community of learners who are prepared to live, work, and contribute to an ever changing society\\" was developed by Walter Milton, who became Superintendent in 2005. Milton subsequently wrote a book entitled Me in the Making which included a chapter on his stormy tenure in Flint.Journalaccessdate=February 11, 2008 http://blog.mlive.com/flintjournalpublisher=Flint Journalaccessdate=February 11, 2008 In November 2012, Superintendent Linda Thompson announced her retirement. Thompson, 57, is a Flint native who has worked 36 years with the district in several roles. She worked her way up the ranks from teacher to assistant principal, to principal before coming to the administration building and her eventual selection as superintendent. Linda Thompson, a native of Flint and graduate of the University of Michigan School of Education assumed the Superintendentship in 2008 and set about downsizing the District by closing schools. In late 2011 the District was found to be running a deficit of 3.7 million dollars by the accounting firm of Yeo and Yeo. In early 2012 the Flint School Board opted not to extend Superintendent Thompson's contract beyond the current year, citing the deficit and her previous effectiveness rating of 2.7 out a possible 4.0 points. Mrs. Thompson continued on a one-year contract, but in November 2012, on the heels of the discovery of an even larger budget deficit than the year before, she announced her retirement. In December 2012, Lawrence Watkins Jr. was selected to serve as the Districts Interim Superintendent. Watkins was a longtime Flint School District employee. He graduated from Flint Central High School in 1971 and then graduated from Hillsdale College on a football scholarship in 1975. He's worked for the district, in some capacity, \\"since I was 14 years of age,\\" he has said. He was a locker room attendant in high school. After college, Watkins became varsity wrestling coach at Central High. In 1986, he became staff assistant for the district's office of pupil personnel services. He held several other positions in the administration office before retiring as director of pupil personnel services in 2012. He also served as director of school safety and security. Larry Watkins helped the Flint School District usher in a comprehensive educational plan, negotiate concessions from bargaining units and collaborate with community organizations to bring back the community education model that put Flint schools on the map. At the same time, Watkins saw Flint schools' deficit grow from $4 million to $21.9 million in a little over two years, thousands of students leave the district and numerous school buildings closed. On April 8, 2015, Mr. Watkins announced his retirement. In August 2018, The Flint Community Schools selected Derrick Lopez, JD as its new Superintendent.https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/08/new_flint_schools_superintende.html One of his first acts was to secure funding from the Elon Musk Foundation in the amount of $480,350 to replace each water fountain in all of the Flint Community Schools with new water stations and two filtration systems: carbon filtration to remove the lead and ultraviolet filtration to remove other chemicals and soluble particulates. As of December 2018, Flint Community Schools have agreed to switch to the balanced school calendar for the 2019-2020 school year. This will affect all schools in the district. Freeman was the only school with a balanced calendar before the change. https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/10/elon_musk_donates_480k_to_flin.html The city of Flint's two oldest schools were Flint Central High School (formerly Flint City High School) and Flint Northern High School. Due to administrative decisions and budget cuts, Flint Central High School, founded in 1875, is not currently in operation; Flint Northern High School, founded in 1929, ranked in the bottom 1% of Michigan secondary schools and was also closed in 2013.

Hurst supported a relaxation of Canada's Sunday shopping laws for communities on the American border, arguing that this step would counter the effects of cross- border shopping on the local economy. He opposed a restrictive shopping law brought forward by the province of Ontario in early 1991.Kenneth Kidd and Donn Downey, \\"Sunday shopping law attacked\\", Globe and Mail, 5 June 1991, A1. Mayor Hurst was elected Mayor of Windsor in the 1991 municipal election, defeating local magazine publisher Jerry Woloschuk. The incumbent mayor, John Millson, did not seek re-election in order to spend more time with his family. Hurst renewed his opposition to Sunday shopping legislation after the election, and indicated that he might attempt to circumvent the law through legal means.Paul Waldie and Drew Hasselback, \\"Shoppers give warm greeting to return of Sunday spending\\", Globe and Mail, 2 December 1991, A8. He welcomed a 1992 ruling by the Ontario Municipal Board which allowed Sunday shopping in much of Windsor to promote tourism.Chris Vander Doelen, \\"Windsor stores win fight to open Sunday\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 2 May 1992, A5. =Major projects= Hurst announced in 1992 that he would support the construction of a casino for Windsor, to be built by private enterprise and leased to the province. He argued that fifty million Americans lived within driving distance of the city, and that a casino would greatly improve the city's threatened economy.\\"Windsor casino plan may beat Detroit to punch\\", Grand Rapids Press, 16 March 1992, B3. The plan was accepted by the provincial government of Bob Rae, and casino operations were opened to the public in 1994.Jeffrey Ulrich, \\"Canadian province turns to casino gambling to pay bills\\", Las Vegas Review- Journal, 1 May 1992, 12E. Despite concerns about the long-term viability of a casino-centred economy, the project encountered relatively little organized opposition from the local community. On opening night in 1994, Hurst proclaimed, \\"These are momentous days for Windsor. Windsor is a city of hope.\\"\\"Casino opens in style: Windsor celebrates newest 'tourist facility'\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 16 May 1994, A3. One year later, with the casino generating strong revenues, he said, \\"It's changed the city forever.\\"\\"Windsor casino is on a roll . . . on its first anniversary\\", Hamilton Spectator, 18 May 1995, A11. The permanent Casino Windsor building was opened in 1998.Heather Greenwood, \\"Glitzy casino opens its doors\\", Toronto Star, 28 July 1998, A6. Hurst also made several efforts to build a new arena in downtown Windsor, although these plans were beset with various delays.Rob MacKenzie, \\"Infrastructure in Canada finds itself in a hole\\", Financial Post, 5 October 1992, p. 8. In the late 1990s, he championed a successful plan to construct an office tower complex for Chrysler Canada Ltd.\\"Windsor set to OK Chrysler tower\\", Associated Press Newswires, 2 October 1998, 16:40. Hurst was instrumental in the removal of the Holiday Inn ( Plywood Palace ) on the Northside of Riverside Drive in April 1999 two weeks before demolition the structure burnt. This opened up continuous public access for over 5 kilometers \\" a jewel in the Crown for the City of Windsor \\" =Relations with the provincial government= Hurst criticized the provincial government in April 1993 for cancelling a plan to relocate government jobs from Toronto to other communities. The Rae government had planned to decentralize the public sector after coming to office but was forced to change its plans in the face of a serious recession.Darcy Henton, \\"'People devastated' as job relocation plan is shelved\\", Toronto Star, 24 April 1993, A1. In 1997, Hurst criticized the provincial government of Mike Harris (who succeeded Rae as premier in 1995) for introducing a bill to give the province extensive powers over public sector unions. He argued that it was unhelpful and unnecessarily confrontational.David Lewis Stein, \\"Mayors psyched to take Tories to task\\", Toronto Star, 24 August 1997, F4. He also criticized the government's downloading of provincial services to the municipalities, arguing that the municipalities lost money from the arrangement.Richard Brennan, \\"Skarica, Carr defy premier\\", Hamilton Spectator, 3 December 1997, B4; Paul Moloney, \\"Other cities in Toronto's corner\\", Toronto Star, 31 January 2001, p. 1. Hurst was himself asked to run for Harris's Progressive Conservative Party in a 1997 by- election, but declined.Ian Urquhart, \\"Windsor by-election could be a real scrap\\", Toronto Star, 28 August 1997, A31. In 1999, Hurst accused provincial cabinet minister Steve Gilchrist of putting himself in a conflict-of-interest situation by suggesting his personal lawyer as a government contact. Hurst says that he rejected the offer outright; Gilchrist denied having seriously made the offer.Richard Brennan, \\"Gilchrist questioned over new allegations\\", Toronto Star, 17 November 1999, p. 1. Hurst later indicated that he would not enforce the Harris government's laws against panhandling.Richard Brennan, \\"Squeegee law faces challenge\\", Toronto Star, 1 February 2000, p. 1. In 2003, he commended Harris's successor Ernie Eves for promising to invest $625 million over five years in the auto sector.Terry Weber, \\"Ontario to invest $625-million in auto sector\\", Globe and Mail, 26 February 2003 (Breaking News). =Other= Hurst also welcomed the return of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operations to Windsor in 1993.\\"Windsor newscast marks new CBC policy\\", Globe and Mail, 19 August 1993, E1. The Windsor City Council voted to license escort services in 1996, as a means of providing legal protection for vulnerable sex-trade workers. Hurst opposed the licensing law, although he later acknowledged that it did not generate any complaints.Jacqueline Smrke, \\"Licensed to sell sex\\", Hamilton Spectator, 23 July 1997, B8. In 2002, two city employees were fired over allegations of the misleading council over lease agreements with MFP Financial Services. One of the employees was also accused of accepting \\"personal benefits\\" from MFP. Hurst was strongly critical of the company's role in the matter.\\"Two Windsor, Ont., officials fired over dealings with MFP Financial Services\\", Canadian Press, 8 February 2002, 19:39 report. Later in the same year, Hurst threatened to call a state of emergency if the provincial and federal governments did not look into the issue of American-board trucks causing gridlock in the city. There were reports that urban gridlock was promoting an economic downturn for the community.\\"Mayor may declare state of emergency\\", National Post, 4 July 2002, A8; Lisa Priest, \\"Endless queues of 18-wheelers test city's patience to the limit\\", Globe and Mail, 29 August 2002, A11. Hurst was re-elected in 1994, 1997 and 2000, each time by a significant margin. Current activities Hurst supported a controversial Detroit River Tunnel Partnership plan near the end of his final term,Kevin McGran, \\"'Everybody's worried about it...The auto sector is desperate'\\", Toronto Star, 13 January 2004, A04. and he was hired as chief executive officer of the partnership's Jobs Tunnel project in January 2004. He was fifty-three years old at the time.\\"Hurst Named CEO of Detroit River Tunnel Partnership\\" [press release], PR NewsWire, 22 January 2004, 14:30 report.

On 13 March 2006 ESPN Classic launched on Sky channel 442 in the UK and Ireland, the first channel in the UK under the ESPN branding. On 3 August 2009, ESPN Classic launched on Virgin Media channel 533 as a part of the XL pack, and in early 2011 video on demand content started to appear on the Virgin Media platform. On 14 August 2009, ESPN Classic launched on UPC Ireland channel 409 as a part of the Max package. It broadcast a range of archive sports coverage, with a large emphasis on football. On 25 February 2013, BT Group agreed to acquire ESPN's UK and Ireland TV channels business, consisting of ESPN and ESPN America, the value of the deal was not disclosed, but BT is understood to have paid \\"low tens of millions\\". ESPN Classic, which was not part of the BT deal, ceased transmission on satellite across Europe, the Middle East and Africa at midnight on 1 August 2013. Programming Much of the channel's output was football. This included action from the Premier League, FA Cup matches, European Cup, European Cup Winners Cup and League Cup finals and some England games. ESPN Classic also showed games from the FIFA World Cup following a multi-year deal to show 150 classic FIFA World Cup matches from 1930 to 2006. Though most coverage on the channel was from the colour era, it had shown original black-and-white footage of European Cup finals going back as far as 1959. A significant proportion of the football action on ESPN Classic was archive ITV football coverage, including matches covered by regional ITV companies. However much of the football seen on the channel was not shown with the original commentary. Instead, many games, especially the Premier League and FA Cup games, tended to feature commentary dubbed on more recently by Jon Champion and Paul Dempsey, or commentary by Sky Sports broadcasters such as Martin Tyler and Alan Parry which seemed to be from the international feed of the time. Similarly, the footage from games where commentary was later added did not include original on-screen captions, with ESPN adding captions themselves. Some 1960s European Cup finals also had a new commentary dubbed on by Tony Jones. The channel also showed some rugby union international matches, including action from the Rugby World Cup, as well as past matches from the rugby union Premiership. Other sports featured included cricket, ESPN-produced vintage boxing matches, The Ultimate Fighter and more recently, action from American sports to complement the live American sports action which was broadcast on ESPN and ESPN America. In addition to the programmes mentioned above, ESPN Classic had made a variety of other programmes. These included Sports Years as well as many football compilation programmes. In addition, to mark the 30th anniversary of ESPN, the channel showed the ESPN Films' 30 for 30 series. ESPN Classic regularly repeated the sporting action that it showed on the channel with the same material often being shown time and time again. Some of the action, especially ESPN-produced programmes and series, had been broadcast on the channel on dozens of different occasions. BBC-produced programming During the first three years of the channel sporting action from the BBC was featured extensively. However, this deal expired in mid 2009 and was seemingly not renewed as for the next eighteen months the channel did not feature any sport produced by the BBC. Therefore, sports such as rugby league, golf, athletics, darts and snooker were not shown on the channel nor were events such as domestic cricket prior to 1999 (the year that the BBC lost the rights to show live cricket), Wimbledon tennis, the Olympic Games and football coverage to which the BBC had the exclusive rights, which had included showings of 1970s and 1980s editions of Match of the Day under the title of \\"The Dead Good Match\\" with the opening and closing titles removed, and some editions were truncated, with only one of the matches covered in a particular programme being shown. One exception had been BBC-produced coverage of rugby union's Five Nations tournament shown during the 2011 Six Nations Championship. In March 2011, a new deal between ESPN and the BBC was signed which provided ESPN Classic with access to around 80 hours of footage. However, this was far less than under the previous agreement which had given the channel access to around 630 hours. The new deal meant that previous ESPN-produced programmes based on the BBC archive, such as the darts series Bellies and Bullseyes, were once again shown on the channel along with new programmes, such as athletics series Solid Gold - Team GB and other one-off programmes such as a compilation of top Grand Nationals. This new deal with BBC Sport coincided with a new look for the channel, the first new look since ESPN UK launched in summer 2009. Live action ESPN Classic occasionally showed live action when two events to which ESPN has the rights took place at the same time. The first live sport that the channel showed was two UEFA Europa League matches, on 29 September and 20 October 2011. The first of the two games was Maribor and Birmingham. On 9 January 2012, the channel broadcast the third evening of the BDO World Darts Championship because the main channel was showing a third round match from the FA Cup. This happened again a year later when for the same reason ESPN Classic again showed the third evening's action. On 5 May 2012, ESPN Classic broadcast two live events - the final day of rugby union's Premiership league season and a football match from Serie A. This was due to the main channel showing live coverage of the FA Cup Final. On 1 September 2012, ESPN Classic showed a live rugby union match from the Aviva Premiership because the main network was broadcasting its weekly match from football's Premier League. The same happened two weeks later although the clash this time was due to the main channel showing the Scottish Premier League. On 20 and 22 September 2012, ESPN Classic showed live coverage of the European Darts Championship because the main channel was showing the UEFA Europa League and the Aviva Premiership respectively. The following day (Sunday 23rd) ESPN swapped its coverage with the darts being shown on the main channel with much of its traditional Sunday fare of European league football plus another Aviva Premiership match airing on Classic. On 4 May 2013, ESPN Classic was used to provide coverage of a second game from the final set of league matches of the 2012‚Äì13 Aviva Premiership season.

It is a tributary of the Red River that runs in an easterly direction through West Texas . It was discovered and mapped for the first time in 1856 by Jacob de C√≥rdova, who found the river while surveying for the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad Company; it was named after Texas Governor Elisha M. Pease. In December 1860, the Texas Rangers recaptured Cynthia Ann Parker and her daughter from the Comanche Indians at an engagement along the river. The river begins northeast of Paducah in northern Cottle County and runs eastward for to its mouth on the Red River northeast of Vernon. Its course flows through \\"flood-prone flat terrain with local shallow depressions, surfaced by sandy and clay loams\\"; part of it forms the county line between Hardeman and Foard counties. The river has three main branches, the North Pease, Middle Pease, and Tongue (or South Pease) rivers; the beginning of the main river is variously given as where all three branches come together, or where only the North and Middle Pease Rivers intersect. Satellite and topographical imagery, however, clearly shows that the Tongue River empties into the Middle Pease before the latter's meeting with the North Pease. North Pease River The North Pease rises southeast of Cedar Hill on the Caprock Escarpment in eastern Floyd County and runs through Motley, Hall and Cottle before meeting the Middle Pease River. It begins at and descends over , cutting a wide, sandy bed through mostly flat terrain; most of the area through which it passes is remote ranchland. Middle Pease River The Middle Pease river rises northwest of Matador at the confluence of Mott and Boggy Creeks in western Motley County; it flows about for in an eastward direction before joining the North Pease in northeastern Cottle County. It runs through flat, isolated ranch territory; the only settlement ever established on its banks was the now-ghost of Tee Pee City. The state has established a region called the Matador Wildlife Management area along its course in northwestern Cottle County. Tongue River The Tongue River, or South Pease River, was named allegedly for a 19th-century disease, called \\"Black Tongue\\", that killed many area buffalo. It rises west of Roaring Springs in southwestern Motley County and flows east and northeast through rugged ranch- and canyonland. The geographic feature of Roaring Springs (not to be confused with the town), downstream from the river's source, was a popular gathering place for Indians, cowboys, and others. A ranch club is now located near the spring, where State Highway 70 crosses the river.

It is distributed through much of the countryside of C√≥rdoba and Seville, and is concentrated particularly in the area of Utrera, which is considered the heartland of the breed. In 2009 the population was estimated at 10,000 birds. A very different type of Andalusian, more intensely blue and with blue-laced plumage, was created in England from birds imported from Andalusia through selective breeding and cross-breeding with birds of other breeds. History There is little information on the early history of the Andalusian. Blue chickens from Andalusia were imported to England no later than 1851. The creation of the \\"international\\" type of Andalusian, with blue-laced plumage, is attributed to the English, whether in Andalusia or in Britain. Two breeders in particular are thought to have started this process, which took many years: one named Coles, from Fareham, Hampshire, and a certain John Taylor of Shepherd's Bush, in west London. Another claimant was Augusta Legge who was the countess of Dartmouth.K. D. Reynolds, Legge, Augusta, countess of Dartmouth (1822‚Äì1900)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 March 2017 Andalusians were shown at Baker Street, London, in January 1853; they were not included in the original Standard of Excellence in 1865. Andalusians reached the United States in about 1850‚Äì55, and were included in the first edition of the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874. The breed arrived in South America in 1870, and was first shown in Germany in the same year. A bantam was created in the 1880s. Characteristics The slate-blue plumage of the Andalusian is caused by a dilution gene, which, in combination with the E gene for black plumage, produces partial dilution of the melanin which gives the black colour. Not all Andalusians are blue: birds with two copies of the gene have near-total dilution, and are off-white; birds with no copies have no dilution, and are black; those with one copy have partial dilution, and are blue. Blue birds occur, in Mendelian proportion, twice as often as each of the other colours. All are present in the population. The earlobes of the Andalusian are smooth, white, and almond-shaped; the crest is single and of medium size, with five well-defined points. The skin is white and the legs and feet are black. Use Andaluza Azul hens lay about 165 white eggs per year; eggs weigh Blue- bred white hens lay the largest eggs.

The book documents the author's death and resurrection experience in 1989. 90 Minutes in Heaven remained on the New York Times Bestseller List for more than five years and has sold over six million copies. The book has also been adapted into a feature-length film, released in theaters on September 11, 2015. Summary On January 18, 1989, Baptist minister Don Piper was on his way home from a conference in Texas when a semi-trailer truck struck his Ford Escort while crossing a bridge. Piper describes that he was crushed by the roof of his car, the steering wheel impaled his chest, and the dashboard collapsed on his legs. When paramedics arrived, they could not find any sign of life in Piper and covered him with a tarp as a fellow pastor prayed over him while waiting for the medical examiner to arrive. According to Piper, he went straight to Heaven and experienced things he describes as amazing and beautiful, including meeting family members such as his great-grandmother and joining a Heavenly Choir that proceeded into the Gates of Heaven. Piper, an ordained minister since 1985, has recounted his narrative before 3,000 live audiences that included more than 1.5 million people altogether, and has appeared on numerous television and radio programs.

Steve is portrayed by Stephen Nichols and Kayla is portrayed by Mary Beth Evans. On the Internet message boards[5] the couple is often referred to by the portmanteau \\"Stayla\\" (for Steve and Kayla). The couple was initially popular from 1986 through 1990 until the \\"death\\" of Steve. Both characters have since returned: after Steve being presumed dead for 16 years, Steve returned to the show on June 9, 2006; Kayla returned on June 12, 2006. Steve and Kayla were dropped off canvas in February 2009. Kayla returned in December 2011. In August 2015, Steve returned to Salem, and the couple reunited soon after.  Storyline  = 1986-1990 = Steve Johnson was a former Merchant Marine who came to Salem working as a mercenary. He had a vendetta against his former best friend, Bo Brady (Kayla's brother) who had gouged out his eye during a fight long ago. His bad boy image and criminal actions were no match for the beautiful good girl, Kayla Brady. One night, he rescued her from a street gang and left a note with his number on her car, and eventually, the two fell in love. Kayla pushed Steve away, but he was undeterred. He kept trying to convince her that they were meant to be together. Kayla's family were opposed to the pairing, most especially Bo Brady, who believed Steve to be dangerous. Steve received an incredible shock when his sister came to town. Adrienne had been born after Steve's mother had brought Steve and baby Billy to an orphanage. Steve had been 5, Billy had been a young baby. Jo Johnson (Steve's mother) was afraid her husband Duke would kill the children (or vice versa) due to Duke's extremely violent nature. Steve wanted nothing to do with Adrienne or Jo, but deep down, he was yearning for the mother he had loved and hoped to see again. Duke ended up raping his virgin daughter, Adrienne, when she refused to tell him where to find her mother. She shot him in self-defense when he staggered over to her to do it again, and then she blocked out the memory of the rape and the killing. Steve tried to take the blame and developed a strong protectiveness towards his sister. Adrienne remembered what had happened just in time, during the trial, and Steve was exonerated. He started to push Kayla even further away, blaming her at first for not letting him kill Duke when he had had a chance (before the rape) and then fearing that he would be just like Duke, after his mother angrily told her children that Duke hadn't always been so bad when they confronted her on her decision to ever hook up with a man like him. She told Steve that Steve reminded her of Duke in many ways, not realizing how painful those words would be. Their relationship would be challenged by the news that Steve had a wife. While taken aback and hurt by the news, Kayla continued the relationship. Then Kayla's boyfriend, Jack, shows up. Jack is madly in love with Kayla but Kayla does not return the feelings. Jack hopefully pursued Kayla because he thought eventually he would win her over. The Deveraux Family hired Kayla to be Jack's private nurse when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease and quite ill. Steve learned the truth that Jack was his own brother, Billy. When he did, he shunned Kayla, hoping she would end up with Jack so his brother would have someone special with whom to spend his seemingly final days. Believing Steve was no longer interested in her, Kayla accepted a marriage proposal from Jack. Jack (now played by Matthew Ashford) recovered, but Kayla rebuffed every one of his attempts to consummate the marriage, unable to let her love for Steve go. Jack assumed Kayla was just nervous because they didn't know each other all that well. He knew she didn't love him, suspected that there were still feelings between Steve and Kayla, but he still remained hopeful that she would someday love him. Months later, Steve discovered Kayla was being poisoned. Suspecting it to be someone in the Deveraux house, and heartbroken that it could be his baby brother, he kidnapped her and the two *almost made love. They carried on their affair in secret. Kayla wanted to get out of her marriage, but Jo and Steve begged her to wait until Jack's political election had passed. On New Year's Eve/Day, Jack planned a romantic evening for them, and Kayla feigned illness so she and Steve could be together that night. A photographer snapped pictures of them kissing on New Year's Eve, while at the same time, a disconsolate Jack was searching for his wife at a party to do the new years countdown together. Worried what they were doing was wrong, the two said a heartfelt goodbye, something they would do over and over again. A few weeks later, Jack won the political election and an unscrupulous reporter gave him the compromising pictures, intending to blackmail him. Enraged by her behavior and believing that Kayla and Steve had deliberately set out to hurt him, Jack confronted Kayla, and angrily raped her. Steve discovered this, fought his brother, and nearly killed him when Jack fell off the roof where they were fighting. In the aftermath, as Jack suffered from failing kidneys, Steve donated one of his own to save his brother's life. Jack resented - and even harassed - Steve and Kayla, but the revelation that he was Steve's brother and that his own father Harper had been a serial killer (who had tried to poison Kayla) would change his life, eventually for the better. Steve saved Kayla from Harper once more, but Kayla ended up losing her ability to speak following surgery to repair her hearing. When Jack discovered that Kayla was deaf and that part of the reason she was deaf was the stresses in her life, including his own violent behavior, he sadly granted her a divorce. Steve learned to use sign language to communicate with her. Kayla's speech returned on her wedding day when she said \\"I do\\" to marrying Steve. A couple of years later, Steve's supposedly dead wife Marina resurfaced. She wanted to get back together with Steve, but instead asked for his help in finding a special key. A pregnant Kayla thought it was the best thing to do in the hopes Marina would grant Steve a divorce so they could truly be married. Marina had every intent of rekindling things with Steve, but Jack, who was now well on his way to reforming did his level best to bring Steve and Kayla back together, despite Steve and Kayla's insistence that he stay away from them. After going all the way to Italy and back, Marina ended up dead and Kayla was accused of the murder. Due to doctored videotape evidence, Kayla was sentenced to prison for ten years. She gave birth to a daughter, Stephanie, who Steve would raise while Kayla was in prison. However, a deranged nanny kidnapped Stephanie. Kayla escaped prison and she and Steve followed the kidnapper to Australia where, along with Bo and Hope, they were able to recover their baby. Now a newspaper man, Jack Deveraux worked with Jennifer Horton (his employee and future wife) to help push public opinion Kayla's way and help find out who really killed Marina. The evidence against Kayla was soon discovered to be a fraud when Isabella, Marina's sister remembered that she had killed her sister during a violent altercation and Kayla was allowed to return to Salem, a free woman. Steve and Kayla were married again in 1990, this time with Jack Deveraux as best man. The incident with Marina had changed his relationship with Steve and Kayla and Steve was tentatively trying to welcome his brother into his life. Kayla, while always uncomfortable around Jack, tried to make peace with their past and allow the relationship to grow between the brothers. Tragedy would strike, however, when Steve was caught in an explosion aboard Bo Brady's boat. It was no accident; the explosion was meant to kill Bo and was planned by the evil oil baron Lawrence Alamain. Steve survived the blast, but because he thought Steve had evidence against him, Lawrence had Steve's IV poisoned. With a grief-stricken Kayla at his side, Steve died. However, an empty coffin was buried in his grave. = Sixteen years later = Presumed dead after his car went into a river, Jack Deveraux was on his deathbed in a hospice. He was awaiting death, and refusing to let his wife Jennifer, daughter Abigail and mother Jo know he was still alive, hoping to spare them the agony of losing him (yet again, as he has 'died' more than once). A caring orderly tried to see if he wanted anything to eat or drink and a delirious Jack was shocked to see that it was his brother Steve Johnson! Jack could not believe his eyes. Steve believed himself to be a man by the name of Nick Stockton, but a DNA test proved otherwise. Intrigued by the possibilities, and driven by his brother's earnest pleadings that he return home, he convinced Jack to return home as well. On the day of Jennifer's wedding to Frankie Brady, Steve and Jack arrived. Everyone was shocked when Jack interrupted the ceremony. Meanwhile, overwhelmed by the pain of returning to Salem where she had enjoyed such a short time of joy with Steve, Kayla was crying at Steve's graveside at the cemetery at the church, unable to sit through the wedding without breaking down. Suddenly, Steve approached her from behind, asking her if she was okay. The shock of seeing her long lost love caused Kayla to faint, but when she awoke, her wildest dreams were confirmed: Steve has returned. Kayla was overjoyed and has tried not to pressure Steve, who is clearly suffering from amnesia. He has shared the memories he does have, but continually tells Kayla he has no memory of her. Kayla and Steve have spent a lot of time together trying to stir up memories, she explained to him why the sky was blue and the meaning of e=mc2, but upon a visit to Cincinnati, Ohio - Nick Stockton's old stomping grounds - it appeared as though Steve was giving up on those missing memories and on Kayla. She returned to Salem, and Steve would almost immediately follow her. Steve's daughter Stephanie also proved to be a great draw for him, as the young woman joyfully welcomed her thought-dead father into her life. Steve began to push Kayla away again, trying instead to make a love connection with Billie Reed whom he thought to be more like himself than the classy Dr. Kayla Brady. At the same time, his brother Jack made a complete recovery and left with wife and son to head up the London Spectator news office. Jack begged his brother to give his love with Kayla a chance, telling him that Kayla and Steve were meant to be together, which was full circle from the times he tried to tear them apart. Having no memories of his darker past with his brother, Steve was moved and affected by the younger man's words and outpouring of brotherly affection, but he still could not make the move towards a life with Kayla. His daughter roundly scolded him for bringing Billie with him to watch her race (she races cars) and Steve blamed himself when Stephanie was critically injured during the race. Tearfully at her bedside, he had a flashback to holding her as a baby. He still doesn't remember Kayla, but now he remembers Stephanie and he's terrified of how much it hurts to love her, especially as she lies near deaths door. * Steve and Kayla were poisoned by a biotoxin a month later, in November 2006. Steve recovered, but Kayla, hovering near death, fell into a coma. Steve pretended to get his memory back (with the help of notes of his history with Kayla, provided by Bo and Hope) to give her the will to carry on; it worked, and Kayla woke up, weak but responsive. Before John and Marlena could get back from Canada with the antidote for Kayla, she flatlined, and Steve became hysterical; he lifted her up and gave her a long kiss, and miraculously, her heart started to beat again. John and Marlena got to the hospital, the antidote was administered, and Kayla began to recover. After Kayla was released from the hospital, Steve remained by her side, but was distant; because of her fragile, still-recovering state, he was hesitant to tell her that his memory had not really returned. However, Kayla suspected the truth, as he was distant. To find out for certain, she asked Steve to take a trip with her to the bungalow where they had hid from Victor Kiriakis nearly two decades earlier; she wanted to 'test' his memory there. Steve, not knowing that Kayla suspected the truth, reluctantly agreed. Once at the bungalow, Steve decided to tell Kayla the truth: his memory did not return‚Äî and he remembered a life with a separate family, a different wife and daughter. However, he cared about Kayla and he was just determined to keep Kayla alive, and wanted to give her the will to live. Heartbroken but strong, Kayla surprised Steve by telling him that she had already knew that this was the case. She excused herself, going to another room to silently cry. Steve promptly fell asleep on the bed, and began to have flashes of memories and dreams of Kayla. Waking up in the middle of a dream, he thought that he and Kayla were on the run from Victor Kiriakis, something that had happened nearly 20 years prior. Entering the room Kayla was in, he frantically vowed to protect her, as Kayla, shocked, didn't understand what was going on. The flashes of memory became more intense, and Steve, with Kayla holding on to him in an attempt to snap him out of his erratic state, fell; catching his breath, he realized Kayla could be the love of his life, his memory had returned, telling Kayla tearfully, \\"I remember loving you!\\" Kayla was skeptical, but Steve, at first, was oblivious; he was so overjoyed at having his memory back, trying to tell her every memory at once. He soon noticed that she was crying, and was shocked, asking her what was wrong. Kayla replied that she didn't know if she could believe that he had really gotten his memory back, especially not after how he had previously pretended to remember her. Horrified, Steve grabbed her and assured her that he, Steven Earl Johnson, her \\"one-eyed tomcat\\" was indeed back. Overcome, Kayla ran out of the bungalow, crying, with Steve chasing her. Coming back, she nearly fainted‚Äîstill recovering from the biotoxin poisoning‚Äîand he caught her, holding her close and assuring her that everything would be fine. After more desperate pleas from Steve to believe in him, and after he signed 'courage' to her as he did on their wedding day, Kayla relented; they reunited passionately. Over the next year, 2007, Steve and Kayla would overcome the consequences of Steve's brainwashing by Stefano DiMera, who had used him as a pawn. Kayla deprogrammed him after several months of pain and terror. That summer, Steve would act as a go-between for the DiMera family and the Bradys, as he attempted to discover what the DiMeras were up to by infiltrating their mansion as an undercover agent. Also around this time, Kayla began thinking about adopting a child so she and Steve could experience raising one together. Kayla was working at the hospital when she discovered an abandoned baby boy there, and instantly fell in love with him. With some convincing, Steve agreed that they would become the foster parents of the baby boy, nicknamed \\"Pocket\\" by Kayla. After a couple of months, however, Pocket began getting sick, and had to be hospitalized. During this time, Philip Kiriakis discovered he had a son, an in-vitro baby with Mimi Lockhart. Steve, Kayla, and Philip all learned that Pocket was really Philip and Mimi's son, whose real name was Tyler, and who had been abandoned by the surrogate who gave birth to him. In the end, a young couple who had been caring for the baby after he was taken away from Steve and Kayla expressed a desire to adopt him, and Steve and Kayla, though heartbroken to lose the little boy, agreed that the child would be well off with the adoptive parents, as did Philip. Steve and Kayla then had to deal with the rape of their daughter, Stephanie, by Ford Decker, who afterwards died in an accidental fall. In February 2008, Kayla learned that she was pregnant with the couple's second child. On May 16, 2008, in an emotionally charged episode, Kayla gave birth to her and Steve's baby boy, who arrived three months prematurely, and was not breathing at birth; he was immediately transported to the NICU of Salem University Hospital. Devastated yet hopeful, his parents are now dealing with the aftermath. The baby boy has been named Joseph, to be known as 'Joe' Johnson. = Impact = Steve and Kayla were part of a growing \\"supercouple\\" phenomenon on Days of our Lives, largely starting after Luke Spencer and Laura Webber from General Hospital took the daytime world by storm and enthralled viewers with their adventurous and romantic storylines. Steve and Kayla were a classic good girl/bad boy story, with Steve battling his inner demons, stemming from the resentment he felt at being left to live in an orphanage, his abusive parents, and his general disdain for any type of romantic relationship. In contrast, Kayla had been raised in a happy, content family, and grew up with loving parents and siblings. At times, Steve felt it impossible for them to really have anything in common. However, the show stuck by the couple and their pairing was and remains one of the most successful partnerships in DAYS history. They were ranked number 19 on the We Love Soaps list of 50 greatest soap opera couples of all time. In addition to being popular with viewers, Steve and Kayla were also featured regularly in soap opera magazines, appearing on numerous Soap Opera Digest covers, and also appearing in the now-defunct magazines Daytime Television and Soap Opera Update. Their wedding in 1988, occurring over the course of two episodes, caused Days of Our Lives to go to number one in the ratings, something that had not happened for 14 years. They were honored with many accolades, including an honor bestowed by Soap Opera Digest, Favorite Couple, in 1989. Stephen Nichols has also received Best Actor honors from Soap Opera Digest. In the Best & Worst 1988 issue, they were singled out as having the best wedding. Nichols was also nominated for a Daytime Emmy in 1988. Many fellow actors and co-stars have praised the magic of their partnership, with one writer from Soap Opera Update quoting that \\"There was Bogie and Bacall, Tracy and Hepburn, and Scarlett and Rhett. Then there was Patch and Kayla.\\" Analysis In the book No End to Her, Martha Nochimson notes that the Patch/Kayla storyline reverses the usual male-focused narrative of the Beauty and the Beast story:  See also  * List of supercouples Further reading * Soap Fans: Pursuing Pleasure and Making Meaning in Everyday Life, Carine Harrington, Temple University Press (2010) * Soap Opera Supercouples: The Great Romances of Daytime Drama, Henrietta Roos, McFarland (2016) * Days of Our Lives: The True Story of One Family's Dream and the Untold History of Days of Our Lives, Ken Corday, Sourcebooks (2011) * It's Time for My Story: Soap Opera Sources, Structure, and Response, Carol T.

The character was promoted to series regular in the first season. Introduced to television audiences in the pilot episode ‚ÄúGenesis‚Äù as an employee at Yamagato Industries, Ando is a partner to his co-worker and friend Hiro Nakamura on various quests to save the world. He often has to overcome insecurities about being undervalued and being seen as a sidekick or liability due to his lack of special abilities in contrast to Hiro and other characters. At the end of the third volume, \\"Villains,\\" he acquires the ability to massively amplify the power of any posthuman he touches. Later, in the fourth volume, \\"Fugitives,\\" Ando has learned to channel this energy into concussive blasts, projecting the energy outward to knock back any targets.  Production  = Casting = James Kyson, who portrays Ando, had to audition several times for the role, and recounted the entire process of his being selected in an interview with BuddyTV: Kyson explained that he, a Korean American, had to learn the Japanese language from scratch with the aid of a coach because the role was written as Japanese. As Japanese was grammatically similar to Korean, which he was already fluent in, he did not find the process difficult. = Character = In a discussion about his characters presence in Season 1, Kyson commented on how he felt the relationship between Hiro and Ando had become that of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo respectively, and talked about Ando's progression as a character: He also mentioned his belief that Ando embodied the ‚Äúeveryman,‚Äù and that Hiro's assertion that ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to have superpowers to be a hero‚Äù was true of the character. In an interview with TV Guide, Kyson spoke about the character in Season 2, and his promotion from a recurring character to series regular. He also spoke about the possibility of Ando obtaining a power, saying that, ‚ÄúI fully embrace him as an ordinary mortal,‚Äù but mentioned that, ‚ÄúI do want to get in the mix a little bit. To get in there and do some action.‚Äù Regarding Season 3, Kyson expressed the belief that Ando's role would be important, and that his background story would be explored:  Character history  = Genesis = Ando first appeared to the audience as a friend of Heroes protagonist Hiro Nakamura, watching an internet video of online stripper Niki Sanders. Ando did not believe that Hiro could manipulate space and time, even after Hiro teleported into the women's bathroom of a bar. After the incident, he told Hiro to stop trying to be different and accept his lot in life. When Hiro returned from the future in \\"One Giant Leap,\\" he convinced Ando of his powers and Ando then traveled with Hiro to America to prevent the explosion from occurring. Following an issue of a ‚Äú9th Wonders!‚Äù comic book they went to Las Vegas and visited a casino, where Hiro used his powers to cheat at gambling. After being thrown out, they were attacked by some men that lost money to them. They argued in the next episode and Ando left Hiro to find Niki Sanders at her home, where he was apprehended by a group of police. He then reunited with Hiro in their journey to find Isaac Mendez. After contacting Peter Petrelli, Ando and Hiro learnt about the latters future self. They were again confronted by the men they defeated in the poker game, and forced to play another round. Ando panicked during the game and rushed with Hiro to the bathroom. While in there, their opponents were killed and they fled. Ando later consoled Hiro, telling him he could perhaps change their deaths by time travel after their mission. While on the road, they happened upon a burning car, and helped D.L. Hawkins save the life of the passengers. Ando called the police, which forced D.L. to flee with his son Micah. Further along in their journey they stopped at a Diner in Odessa, Texas, where they met a waitress named Charlie Andrews, who had the ability to instantly memorize things. When Charlie was killed in the storage room of the diner by an unknown man Hiro, despite Ando's pleading, traveled back in time to prevent her death. He failed to return within five seconds as he promised, leaving Ando alone. Later in the diner, Ando noticed a picture of Charlie and Hiro together, taken six months ago, and realized Hiro had traveled back there. Peter Petrelli called, and later met Ando at the diner. Ando protested against Peter going to find ‚Äúthe cheerleader‚Äù without the presence of someone with abilities, but Peter left. Eventually, Hiro returned, having failed to save Charlie, and they continued onwards to Union Wells High School . When it became clear they had arrived too late, Hiro felt the world was doomed. As they left, they received a phone call from Isaac Mendez, whom they met back at the diner, with Isaac telling them of his prophetic paintings. Later, he painted another of Hiro. In ‚ÄúGodsend,‚Äù Ando and Hiro finally arrived at New York, and visited the Museum of Natural History looking for a sword like the one in Isaac's painting, and they find the Blade of Takezo Kensei, a legendary samurai. They stole it, but it transpired that the sword was a replica, with the original belonging to a Mr. Linderman. They went to Isaac's loft seeking his help, and met Simone Deveaux, who told them that Linderman resided in Las Vegas. When Ando and Hiro were kidnapped and brought to Hiro's father in ‚ÄúThe Fix‚Äù, Ando became attracted to Hiro's sister, Kimiko in the next episode. In ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù, Ando became infatuated with a woman named Hope, who convinced Ando to obtain a bag of hers from her ‚Äòex-boyfriend‚Äô. When he returned with it, Hope convinces Ando to give her a ride. Hiro, who had been locked up by Hope, pursued them with her ‚Äòex- boyfriend‚Äô, a gaming commission officer. This led to a shoot-out between Hope and the officer, and afterwards, Hiro told Ando to go home. Ando nonetheless followed Hiro, and saved him from arrest when Hiro was discovered stealing Takezo Kensei's sword from Linderman's casino. Hiro teleported them away. In ‚Äú.07%,‚Äù it is revealed to the audience that Hiro has teleported them both five years into the future, were they encounter Hiro's future self. With ‚ÄúFive Years Gone,‚Äù New York has been devastated by the atomic explosion predicted by Isaac. When Hiro is captured by Homeland Security, Ando and Future Hiro escaped, and plotted to free him so he and Ando could return to their time and stop the bomb. Ando learned from Future Peter that he was killed in the explosion. They eventually manage to free Hiro, but Future Hiro was killed by Matt Parkman. As he died, he handed to Ando a page of a ‚Äú9th Wonders!‚Äù comic book. Ando and Hiro returned to the present, and traveled to Isaac's loft to consult him. They found him dead, killed by Sylar, and hid as the killer detected them. They escaped him and then followed him to his mother's. Hiro did not want to kill Sylar, but Ando showed Hiro the ‚Äú9th Wonders!‚Äù comic page which shows him dead. Hiro unsuccessfully attempts to kill Sylar. He and Ando teleport to safety, where they discovered that the sword has been broken. They try to have the sword repaired, and Ando and Hiro encountered Hiro's father once more. Kaito and Hiro spoke alone, and Ando, impatient, decided to seek out and kill Sylar himself. In the season finale, Ando went to Isaac's loft and found Sylar. The superhuman villain overpowered him and prepared to kill him. Ando dropped the ‚Äú9th Wonders!‚Äù comic book in the process, revealing to Sylar that Hiro would kill him. When he started to kill Ando, Hiro arrived and teleported himself and Ando to the offices of Yamagato industries back in Tokyo, where their journey started. Hiro gives Ando Kensei's sword, promised to return, before he finally teleported to Kirby Plaza to kill Sylar with Ando's sword. In the graphic novel \\"Heroism is Found in the Heart,\\" after Hiro was teleported back to Japan, Ando was reassigned by Kaito Nakamura to Hiro's former position. Ando became infatuated with Kimiko Nakamura and sought her affections. One night, he walked her home and they were confronted by a group of bikers. Ando learned that the leader, Fukazawa, was also pursuing Kimiko. Ando and Kimiko ran, but were eventually cornered. Ando promised to protect Kimiko and confronted the gang. When they ran away, Ando kissed Kimiko. Neither were aware that Kaito had scared the pursuers away. =Generations= In \\"Four Months Later...,\\" Ando has returned to New York City following Hiro's disappearance, waiting for his friend's return with Kaito Nakamura. Kaito receives a death threat and Ando leaves to get a sword for protection. He returns to see Kaito killed by Adam Monroe, though Ando does not see the killer's face. Following Kaito's death, Ando is questioned by Matt Parkman about the incident, but, besides telling him the meaning of the helix symbol, Ando is unable to answer his questions. In the episode \\"Kindred,\\" Ando discovers that Hiro has left messages for him, stored within the hilt of Takezo Kensei's sword. The messages, written while he was in the year 1671, detail Hiro's adventures with Takezo Kensei. Hiro returns in \\"Out of Time,\\" to Ando's delight. While both are happy about the reunion, Ando sorrowfully tells Hiro about his father's death. At Kaito's funeral, Ando is dismayed at Hiro's decision to go back and time to save his father, but is unable to dissuade him. However, Hiro realizes that Ando is right and does not change history, instead using the opportunity to discover that Adam Monroe, who he knows as Takezo Kensei, was responsible. Hiro makes it his mission to stop Adam and confronts him at the Primatech Paper Facility. He returns to Ando with the assurance that Adam can never hurt anyone again. =Villains= In \\"The Second Coming,\\" Hiro, resigned to working in his father's office at Yamagato Industries, told Ando that he was bored without a quest. Suddenly Kaito's lawyer turned up with a recorded message from Kaito to Hiro. It instructed him to guard the contents of a safe, and never open it. Hiro curiously opened the safe and found one half of a molecular formula, which was stolen by an unidentified person with the ability of super speed. When Hiro travelled to the future to learn more about the formula, he saw himself be killed by Ando, who had a power. Ando then took the formula before Tokyo was devastated by an unexplained disaster. After that in \\"The Butterfly Effect,\\" they travelled to Paris in search of the thief, identified as Daphne Millbrook, and Hiro explained to Ando that in the future he saw Ando kill him. Ando was shocked and told Hiro he could never do that when Daphne arrived. Events led to Hiro freezing time while Daphne held a knife at Ando's throat. Hiro saved Ando by allowing her to leave with the formula. They continued to follow Daphne in the next episode, and she tried to drive Hiro and Ando apart by undermining Ando. Hiro and Ando noticed the Haitian, and discovered he was in possession of the other half of the formula. Ando knocked the Haitian out. Daphne managed to steal the other half from them, and before they can give chase, the Haitian awoke and apprehended them both, taking them to the Level 2 prisons of the Primatech Facility. The next episode showed Hiro and Ando arguing, with Ando claiming that Hiro did not value him as a partner. While trying to escape, Hiro realized he did need Ando. They almost escape, but are caught by the Haitian. He takes them to Angela Petrelli, who claims that Hiro has the \\"key\\" to solving the whole issue of the formula. Ando then helped Hiro dig up the key: Adam Monroe. In \\"Angels and Monsters,\\" Adam begrudgingly took Ando and Hiro to a bar that was a gathering place for \\"specials for hire,\\" and caused a fight. This led to Hiro being knocked out, and Adam escaping. Ando proclaimed them \\"the worst heroes ever,\\" before Daphne and Knox entered the bar, wanting to recruit Hiro to the Pinehearst Company. Knox said that to prove himself, Hiro had to kill Ando, handing him a sabre sword. Hiro appeared to do so, but in the next episode it was revealed that Hiro froze time. After that, he acquired a collapsible sword and fake blood, then traveled slightly back in time to tell Ando that, when the time came, he had to pretend to be dead. He returned to the correct moment, and stabbed Ando. When Daphne and Knox left, Ando stood up again. They travelled to Africa on their first assignment in search of Usutu, a man who could paint the future. Ando expressed doubt over their situation, saying they were working for the bad guys. Hiro reassured him it was simply to infiltrate Pinehearst. They were unable to capture Usutu through Hiro's time traveling abilities, so they tried to do it by hiding and waiting for him. He congratulates them for using their heads as opposed to Hiro's power, and in \\"Eris Quod Sum\\", offers Hiro and Ando the chance to take a spirit walk for guidance. Ando refused, and watched over Hiro as he slept in \\"Villains.\\" In \\"It's Coming,\\" he tried to save Hiro from Arthur Petrelli, but was tossed aside by Arthur's telekinesis. When Arthur became distracted, he and Hiro escaped. Hiro though, had regressed back into his 10-year-old self, and Ando tried to help him reclaim his memories in a bowling alley. Hiro then teleported them to a comic book store, where Ando spotted a new issue of \\"9th Wonders!\\" and saw an opportunity to help Hiro become normal again. In the first part of \\"The Eclipse,\\" Ando was taken by Hiro to Mohinder Suresh's apartment to meet Matt Parkman, and the three followed the speedster after she fled to her childhood home. Hiro and Matt were shocked to discover their powers gone. While Matt attempted to talk to Daphne, Ando and Hiro left, with Hiro claiming to know a way to regain his power. Hiro takes him to a comic book store, and with the help of two comic book geeks Sam and Frack, the four search through copies of 9th Wonders! to learn of Hiro's fate and any possible way to repair his memory. After Frack discovers a scene depicting Hiro and Claire Bennet hiding as Kaito Nakamura gives baby Claire to her father Noah Bennet, Hiro teleports away without Ando. Parkman and Daphne find Ando in the comic book store, and they try to figure out how to follow Hiro's adventure. Sam tells them that there is only one last copy of 9th Wonders!, given by Isaac Mendez to a bike courier before his death. Daphne takes Ando and Parkman to New York in \\"Our Father\\" to track the comic book down. They find the last copy, and discover that Hiro is stuck 16 years in the past as Arthur Petrelli has taken Hiro's powers. The three come to the conclusion that the only way to save Hiro is to find another time-traveler. Ando volunteers himself to take an experimental formula to give him the ability to manipulate space and time so he can save Hiro. In \\"Dual,\\" Daphne steals a dose of the formula from Mohinder, and gives it to Ando. Ando manifests the ability to \\"super charge\\" the abilities of others, which he uses on Daphne to allow her to run faster than the speed of light, enabling time travel per Einstein's Theory of Relativity. They rescue Hiro from the past, saving Hiro from death at the hands of his father but likewise preventing Hiro from destroying the formula. Nevertheless, Hiro is able to steal the formula in the present with Daphne's help and the group celebrates as he destroys it. =Fugitives= Cold Snap\\". In \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\" Hiro and Ando are back in Japan. Hiro has bought an abandoned fire station as their headquarters. Ando leaves Hiro frustrated after he's injected with a GPS device and feels that Hiro is trying to live through him since he has lost his powers. Later, Ando hears Hiro being kidnapped by Nathan's agents through the phone. In \\"Trust and Blood,\\" using the GPS device Hiro injected himself with, Ando figures out that Hiro is in Arkansas. Daphne arrives in Japan to find Hiro and Ando to talk about Matt's disappearance. Daphne and Ando go to Arkansas and see the plane's crash site. After Daphne appears to have been killed and Claire uses herself as a shield, Ando, Mohinder, Matt, and Hiro escape and meet up with Peter. Then he and Hiro realize that they must travel to India as seen in one of Matt's paintings. In \\"Building 26,\\" once in India, Hiro and Ando realize that they must save a local girl, Annapoora, from being married against her will. At first Ando uses his red glow as the sign she was looking for, but he \\"steals\\" Hiro's chance to recover his powers and also he ends up being kidnapped by the groom to force Annapoora into marriage. Finally, Hiro realizes that he does not need powers to be a hero, as he saved the girl without them, getting Ando back too. Later, Annapoora gives them a message \\"Rebel\\" sent them: to find Matt Parkman in LA. As seen in \\"Shades of Gray\\" and continued in \\"Cold Snap,\\" Hiro and Ando arrive Los Angeles where they find that the Matt Parkman \\"Rebel\\" was referring to was only a baby, also named Matt Parkman. Later they discover that this is actually the son of the Matt Parkman they know, and also discover the baby possesses the ability to touch things and make them \\"go.\\" While Hiro and Ando are convincing Janice that Matt Sr. is not a terrorist and that his baby is in danger, agents take Janice away and break into the house. Ando shows that his acquired ability can also be used as an offensive weapon when he channels the energy outward to hit one of the pursuing agents, before Hiro manages to stop time with his partially restored ability (Matt Jr. used his powers to restore part of Hiro's). Hiro carries baby Matt and a paralyzed Ando to safety as he is unable to teleport, having only regained the ability to stop time. In \\"Turn and Face the Strange,\\" Hiro and Ando have the mission to take baby Matt to Matt Sr., but Matt Jr. keeps inactivating any vehicle they are on due to the noise they make, until Ando comes with a funny face to entertain the baby, so Hiro convinces him to keep it so the \\"cube\\" can go. They finally manage to track down Matt Sr. who has gone to confront Danko. Hiro ends up saving Matt, and then he meets his son for the first time, giving Matt a reason to live again. In \\"I Am Sylar,\\" after failing to convince Matt to join them, Hiro and Ando go to Reed Street Laboratories to set up a trap for HLS agents, using Ando as bait. Although he refuses, as Hiro manages to not freeze him, Hiro still keeps his plan going on, unfreezing the agents so they can take down Ando, and then freezing everybody again so he can take an agent's place as they carry Ando to the \\"Building 26.\\" Once in motion, Ando is awoken by Hiro so he can be ready for action, but when an agent realizes Hiro is not one of them, Ando shoots a big blast of red lightning, affecting everyone and saving Hiro. As plan B, they use the GPS signal of the agents to track the place, and once they are ready to fight, Hiro tries to freeze time, but instead he receives a strong headache and nosebleed as they realize he cannot use his ability anymore. Ando is then seen aiding Hiro. In \\"An Invisible Thread,\\" because of Hiro's condition, Ando plans to enter \\"Building 26\\" by himself, but Hiro recovers and insists on continuing with the plan despite the danger. Hiro stops time and both break in to free the trapped prisoners, including Mohinder, Noah and Danko, and replace the drugged evolved humans with all of the \\"Building 26\\" staff. Once time is going, Hiro and Ando show the freed prisoners the way out. Ando asks Mohinder to check out Hiro, finding out his body is rejecting his powers and he should stop using them. As Hiro faints after saving Noah from Danko, is apparently taken to a hospital by Ando and Mohinder. Later, Ando, along with Hiro, witness the burning of Sylar's (really James Martin) body and then both decide to return home. =Redemption= In \\"Orientation,\\" Ando and Hiro have opened a hired hero business called Dial-A- Hero settled in a conference room at the Yamagato Building, which enrages Kimiko. On Ando insistence to visit a doctor, Hiro reveals that his headaches are caused by a terminal illness, and he is dying. Attending their first mission, saving a girl's cat, both Ando and Hiro realize their abilities are not fitted to the situation, but still Ando is forced by Hiro to help the cat. Once he catches the cat, Ando loses balance and falls. Hiro stops time saving him, but Ando notices Hiro remains frozen while time is resumed. Ando then takes Hiro to Yamagato where he unfreezes. While talking, they remember the carnival they attended 14 years before, where a fortune teller directed Hiro on his path to being a hero. Ando remembers as he accidentally spilled a drink over Kimiko, causing her to hate him despite he was in love with her. While remembering this, Hiro's time travel manifests teleporting him to the carnival 14 years in the past. In \\"Jump, Push, Fall,\\" while Hiro is at the carnival in the past, a young Ando is seen together with a young Kimiko in the carnival. The young Hiro rushes into them making Ando spill a Slushy in Kimiko's direction, but Samuel Sullivan pushes adult Hiro in the way to show him past can be changed, so he gets wet instead of Kimiko. This event avoids Ando to be hated by Kimiko, and when adult Hiro teleports back to the present, he finds out the two of them felt in love at the carnival and have dated since. In \\"Acceptance,\\" Kimiko reveals to Hiro that she and Ando have gotten engaged. Ando is concerned about Kimiko wanting Hiro to give her away in the wedding a year from now, knowing that he may not be alive by that time, so he talks Hiro into confessing the truth to Kimiko. Hiro's ever-lasting mission to save a man makes him hear this speech from Ando over and over again, and finally understands the picture. Ultimately, Hiro tells Kimiko the truth about his illness, and then suffers a headache; Ando rushes in the office to help him, but Hiro teleports away in front of Ando and Kimiko, leaving her extremely shocked. In \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas,\\" as Hiro travels back in time 3 years to Midland, Texas to save Charlie, he meets past-Ando waiting for past-Hiro to teleport back (Seven Minutes to Midnight timeline). Hiro convinces past-Ando to stay at the diner to avoid making too many changes and preserve history. In \\"Upon This Rock,\\" a brain-addled Hiro is brought to Ando by the police after they find a business card on him. Ando reveals that Hiro has been missing for six weeks and figures that Hiro's referring to himself and everything else as fictional characters (with Ando being Sancho Panza) is a side-effect of his brain tumor. Ando does not understand what Hiro means by they have to save \\"Doctor Watson\\" at \\"Arkham\\" in the land of the \\"swamp dragons,\\" but decides to check Hiro's comics to try to figure it out. Ando eventually realizes that Hiro is referring to Florida when Hiro mentions Curt Connors and realizes that the \\"swamp dragons\\" are alligators and that Arkham refers to an insane asylum though he still does not understand the Doctor Watson reference. Ando searches on the web and finds that there's an asylum on Arkham Road in Florida and realizes that Hiro means Ando is his sidekick when he refers to him as Sancho Panza. Ando admits this, but Hiro refers to him as the best sidekick he knows. ECT to fix Hiro's mind. In \\"Close to You,\\" Ando checks Hiro into the asylum Hiro keeps referring to, but is reluctant as Hiro in his addled state cannot stop time or use his powers. Hiro points Ando to \\"Watson's\\" room as he's led away, and after Ando uses his power to bypass a lock, he finds out \\"Watson\\" is Mohinder Suresh and realizes that Hiro wants to save him. Ando, realizing that Mohinder cannot use his powers due to the drugs the orderlies are giving him, switches Mohinder's pills with aspirin to stop that, but accidentally swallows Mohinder's pills and enters into a drug-induced daze. Hiro hides him in a closet and later that night frees Mohinder, but the two are forced to wheel Ando out in a wheelchair as he's still in a daze. As the three are found by orderlies, Ando snaps out of it and uses his powers to blast open a door leading out, creating enough of a distraction that Mohinder is able to overpower the orderlies and allow the three to escape. Running through a swamp chased by orderlies and dogs, the three are forced to hide behind a tree and Mohinder suggests Ando use his power like electro-shock therapy to restore Hiro's mind so he can teleport them away. Ando is reluctant as his future self killed Hiro using that power, but Mohinder convinces him to try. Ando shocks Hiro and it does work, restoring Hiro's mind back to normal. With Hiro back to normal, he teleports himself, Mohinder and Ando to Noah Bennet's apartment, seconds before orderlies and dogs find their hiding place. When the three teleport in, they interrupt Noah and Lauren Gilmore kissing and Hiro asks the two for their help. In \\"Pass/Fail,\\" Ando and Hiro watch as Mohinder creates a compass for Noah to use and suggests Ando or Hiro as the ones that use it as only someone with powers can use it. After Mohinder leaves, Hiro collapses due to his brain tumor and Ando has him rushed to the hospital. There, Ando watches worried as the doctors prepare to perform brain surgery to try to remove the tumor and save Hiro's life. In Hiro's hallucination, Ando acts as his lawyer during his trial and his young self acts as a witness for the prosecution. In the real world, Ando watches the surgery and when Hiro crashes makes a rousing speech that gives Hiro strength in his hallucination. The doctors manage to revive Hiro and remove the tumor. Ando later visits Hiro as he recovers from the surgery. In \\"Brave New World,\\" Ando is happy to see Hiro awake and has him test his powers which Hiro now has full control of after his tumor was removed. Ando and Hiro are shocked when Hiro receives a note from Charlie and Ando watches as a now old Charlie and Hiro reunite. When Hiro plans to travel back in time to get Charlie after she arrived in the past, Ando thinks Hiro is being selfish to try to do that as Charlie is clearly happy and leaves the room. He receives a call from Noah Bennet who wants him and Hiro to come to the Carnival in Central Park and Ando goes to get Hiro. Hiro has changed his mind about going back in time after talking to Charlie and now feels he has lost his purpose and has finished all of his missions, but Ando reminds him of Samuel and informs him of Noah's call. Hiro teleports himself and Ando to the Carnival where Claire asks Hiro to teleport all of the carnies away. Hiro tells them all to hold hands, but is unsure if he can teleport them all as there are over a dozen, so Ando offers to use his powers to supercharge Hiro's to teleport everyone. Hiro agrees to try and thanks to Ando supercharging his power, Hiro successfully teleports everyone away which results in Samuel's defeat as the removal of all the special reduces Samuel's power significantly. =Brave New World= Hiro and Ando walk through the Carnival after everything is over and plan to go home. The two witness Claire climbing up the Ferris Wheel and jumping off to reveal her power to the world. Alternate timelines *In \\"Five Years Gone\\", Ando discovers from the future Peter Petrelli that he was killed in the explosion. Peter speculates that it was Ando's death that changed Future Hiro from the optimistic person Ando knows, into the dark focused warrior he has become. *In \\"The Second Coming,\\" Hiro travels into the future Tokyo during a horrific cataclysm. There he finds future Ando and Hiro arguing over the formula. Ando demands that Hiro relinquish the formula, but Hiro refuses, claiming Ando betrayed him. Ando denies this, then hits Hiro with a blast of his energy projection when Hiro draws his sword. Hiro is knocked out or killed by the blast and Ando walks off with the formula. Moments later, an unseen force destroys Tokyo. *In most of the show, Ando loves Kimiko but she does not return it due to an incident with a Slushy at a carnival. After accidentally time traveling, Hiro changes this and in the current timeline Ando and Kimiko are in love and engaged to be married. Besides this, there do not seem to be too many major changes to Ando's history as he still goes on adventures with Hiro and still retains his powers. (Jump, Push, Fall). Powers and abilities Ando's red lightning. During the first two volumes, Ando is a normal human with no abilities. In the opening episode of the third season, \\"The Second Coming,\\" Hiro Nakamura travels into the future and witnesses Ando using an ability described by the writers simply as \\"red lightning.\\" In \\"Dual,\\" Ando injects himself with the formula, revealing that the red lightning amplifies the abilities of others. He demonstrates this unintentionally by boosting the range of Matt Parkman's telepathy to cover all of New York City and increasing Daphne Millbrook's super speed to such an extent that she is able to break the spacetime barrier. In the episode \\"Cold Snap\\" Ando learns to use his power offensively, channeling his energy into powerful bolts through his hands in the classic Hadouken pose, wrists touching with palms exposed. As seen later in \\"I Am Sylar,\\" Ando is able to produce a large volume of energy with greater precision, as he attacks agents inside a van with a heavy blast without affecting Hiro or the van itself. In \\"Close To You,\\" Ando displays the ability to use his power to slightly overload a keypad, allowing him to bypass a locked door without frying the system. He later is able to use a concussive energy blast to blast open a locked door to allow himself, Hiro and Mohinder Suresh to escape an insane asylum. He is also able to use his power as a shock similar to electro-shock therapy to restore Hiro's scrambled mind back to normal. In \\"Brave New World,\\" when Hiro needs to teleport a lot of people to safety, Ando offers to supercharge Hiro's powers so he can do it. Thanks to Ando's supercharging, Hiro is able to teleport dozens of people an unknown distance with no apparent problems while before he has only been able to teleport two at most.

It is operated under the auspices of the Trustees of the Christian Brothers and is situated within the borders of the Catholic Diocese of Broken Bay. The College was ranked 101st in the State for the 2005 Higher School Certificate marks, up from 108th the previous year. More recently, in 2013, the school again improved its rank to 73.\\"HSC 2007: All Class\\" (304 KB) The Daily Telegraph. (20 December 2007). It is a member of the Independent Schools Association (ISA) and the Junior School Heads Association of Australia. The college operates as two separate schools: \\"The Junior School\\" catering for boys in Years 5 and 6, \\"The Senior School\\" catering for boys in Years 7 to 12. History St Pius X College started in 1937 as Christian Brothers Chatswood,History of the College initially going to the Beginner level, with the first Leaving Certificate class graduating in 1941. St Pius X College used to be a co-educational school, partnered with Mercy College, however during the 20th century the partnership ended and each school became single sex. A major improvement in the 1990s was the development of Oxford Falls as an educational complex. Named the Treacy Centre, the facility comprises a variety of sports fields and venues as well as a number of meeting places and classrooms. In the late 1990s the college undertook extensive renovations and rebuilding. Later, during the late 2000s a new building was built, it includes; meeting rooms, stands, basketball courts and can facilitate stage plays (Pius Talent Show). \\"Fide et Labore\\" is written on the shield, which is Latin for \\"By Faith and Labour\\". The current principal is John Couani, the first lay person to be principal at the school. The college has recently implemented an E-Learning program, which provides students with personal learning devices, specifically the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 across the school. These computers act as learning aids and hold student text books. Extra-curricular activities =Sport= The school participates in rugby, cricket, football, basketball, tennis, softball, swimming, squash and athletics. =Debating and public speaking= The college also participates in debating and public speaking. It is a member of the Catholic Schools Debating Association, the largest debating competition for schools in New South Wales and has since 2015 participated in the Sydney Debating Network. It enters students into the Legacy Youth Public Speaking and Plain English Speaking Competitions annually. In 2015 the 11 A debating team were runners up in the CSDA debating competition and were awarded the prestigious Aggregate Senior shield for winning the most debates out of any school in the competition. Following this in 2016 the 12 A team were Grand Final winners of the CSDA Senior Opens debating competition winning the Michael Robson Shield as champions of the Senior Competition.http://www.csda.nsw.edu.au/http://www.spx.nsw.edu.au/news- events/fx-articles.cfm?loadref=15&id;=72 =Music= Music has also always been a large part of extracurricular involvement at St Pius. The various bands include concert bands, jazz bands and guitar ensembles. In order to gain entry to any band, a student must audition. In order to gain access to the Senior Jazz Band and Senior Concert Band, genChouirerally a high level of skill is required in the instrument of which a student plays. The bands and choir often play for the school as well at the Twilight Concert held every term. The twilight concert generally begins with the choir. After the choir have performed, the ensembles usually play next and after which, the Jazz and Concert Bands begin to play. The school has also recently been involved with competitive hissing but no words on a performing group as of yet. Performing Arts is an integral part of the College curriculum and students at St Pius X have every opportunity to make the performing arts an involved part of their lives, through participation in many different types of music and drama activities. =Robotics= St Pius X College has the largest active robotics club in Australia with over 100 members. The school's robotic club takes part in robotics competitions. The two major annual competitions are the RoboCup and First Lego League (FLL). The club consists of members from years five through to twelve. Acceptance is usually granted through the robotics lessons held in class during year five, however, entry to the club in later years can also be granted through applying directly to the robotics coordinator. = Outdoor education = St Pius's Outdoor Education program facilitates personal development and teamwork through camps, excursions and overnight experiences. Outdoor Education is offered to all students, these experiences enhance learning, build relationships and respect, develop leadership and teamwork, as well as resilience as boys overcome fear and adversity as they push outside their comfort zones. Connection with nature also provides a platform for spiritual growth and experience. Highlights of the Outdoor Education Program include: * Milson Island camp (Year 5) * Camp Wombaroo (Year 6) * Ski trip (Year 7) * The Great Aussie Bush Camp (Year 8) * Workul Koo Terrigal (Year 9) * Immersions to Walgett and Bowraville (Year 10) * Snowy Hike (Year 11, the 100 km 6-day trek is a 30 + year tradition at the College) * Bush Retreat to Tallow Beach (Year 12) * Duke of Edinburgh practice hikes and expeditions * Kokoda preparation * Warrumbungles expedition =Mock trial= Students in Year 11 have the opportunity of entering the Mock Trial Competition conducted by the Law Society of New South Wales.

Sadiq al-Mahdi, calculating that the province's demographics favored the \\"African\\" tribes, successfully courted the DDF, leaving Imam al-Hadi to mobilize the \\"Arab\\" vote. Sadiq's faction won 13 of 24 seats, while the faction led by al-Hadi received seven. The factions were reconciled only when the parliamentary government was overthrown by the military coup of Col. Gaafar Nimeiry in May 1969. Both Diraige and al-Sadiq were arrested, while al- Hadi was executed.G√©rard Prunier, Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide, Cornell University Press, 2005, , p. 741-42 In 1979, Darfuris rioted after their province became the only one in which the governor, al-Tayeb al-Mardi, was not locally chosen. Nimeiry had chosen al-Tayeb al-Mardi to oversee the support to the Chadian guerilla force led by Hiss√®ne Habr√©, but grew concerned that he was losing control of the situation. In January 1980, he dismissed al-Tayeb al-Mardi and appointed Diraige. The appointment of the DDR leader resulted in an immediate lessening of tensions. Diraige refused to accept a salary and quickly concentrated on replacing posts filled due to political patronage with largely apolitical civil servants from across the ethnic spectrum who had all been affiliated with the DDF since 1964. The many problems facing the provincial government, including rising racial tensions, the accumulated administrative neglect and spillover from the conflict in Chad, was soon superseded by steadily diminishing rains.Prunier, pp. 49 In the 1981 provincial elections, ethnicity had become a dominant political factor and Diraige, with his large Fur base of support and long out of jail, easily won the governorship. His election, in turn sparked plans by Darfuri Arabs to join with the Zaghawa and Fellata and form an \\"Arab Alliance.\\"Flint, Julie and Alex de Waal, Darfur: A Short History of a Long War, Zed Books, London March 2006, , p. 51 The Diraige government soon realized that they could not dig water boreholes quickly enough to make up for the lowered amount of rainfall. In November 1983, Diraige wrote a letter to Nimeiry warning him that, unless foreign food aid was requested, Darfur faced a serious famine. This letter would come to be known as the \\"famine letter.\\" Since 1977, Nimeiry had been creating an image of Sudan as the \\"future breadbasket of the Arab world\\", was furious with Diraige for sending this inconvenient letter and refused to respond. On 23 December 1983, Diraige flew to Khartoum to present his case in person. Nimeiry made his displeasure clear and stated that he would not ask for aid. An arrest warrant for Diraige was issued about 48 hours later, which he escaped by flying to Saudi Arabia. By August 1984, the existence of the famine was obvious and Nimeiry was forced to declare Darfur a \\"disaster zone\\".Prunier, pp. 50-51 The story of Diraige, the first locally accountable governor who had been forced into exile for warning of a preventable famine, became widely known, further aggravating tensions between Darfur and the northerner-dominated government. Exile By 1987, the situation had worsened. The Libya-Chad War overflowed into the province, resulting in widespread violence. Many Fur military conscripts fighting the Second Sudanese Civil War deserted to the side of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Sudanese Brig. Fadlallah Burma Nasir and Chief of Staff Brig. Fawzi Ahmed el- Fadl visited Diraige at his home in London, asking if he would come back and support the government to stop the desertion of Fur soldiers. Diraige refused.Prunier, p. 62 In the late 1980s, Darfuri politician Daud Bolad sought help from the SPLA in extending the rebellion to Darfur. Other leftist leaders, such as Diraige, believed that the SPLA would use them for its own purpose and intentionally did not associate themselves with the southern rebels. Bolad's capture in 1991 and the destruction of his resistance network was seen as confirmation that this was the correct stance.Flint and de Waal, p. 22, and Alex de Waal, \\"Counter-Insurgency on the Cheap\\", London Review of Books, 5 August 2004 Diraige created the Sudan Federal Democratic Alliance (SFDA), a member organization of the opposition National Democratic Alliance. From 1996, SFDA deputy Sharif Harir set up an office in Asmara, Eritrea, from which it actively recruited armed fighters from migrant Darfuris.Alex de Waal, \\"As they sign a peace, is this the face of yet another tragedy\\", parliamentary brief (hosted by Sudan Tribune), February 2005 On 23 January 2004, Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Taha met Diraige in Nairobi, while ostensibly on hajj break from talks in Naivasha ending the war in the south. Diraige used his personal credibility to get the Darfuri rebels to agree to talks on humanitarian matters in Geneva to be mediated by the Henri Dunant Foundation, as a trust-building first step. The government then broke Diraige's trust by publicly demanding a meeting on \\"national reconciliation\\" in Khartoum. This had been the last line of communication that the government still had with the Fur rebels.Prunier, p. 112 In 2003, the Darfur Liberation Front, a new rebel group fighting a steadily escalating conflict asked the SFDA for political and logistical support. Harir agreed and declared that the DLF fighters were the military wing of the SFDA. However, Diraige disagreed that this was the time for armed rebellion and the DLF got no substantive support.Flint and de Waal, p. 81 This position apparently changed. In June 2006, Diraige was named the head of the National Redemption Front, a coalition of the SFDA, Justice and Equality Movement and the faction of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) that had not signed the May deal taken by the faction of the SLA led by Minni Minnawi.Martin Plaut, \\"Darfur - on the brink of new conflict\\", BBC News, 4 September 2006\\"Joint Statement of Darfur Leaders Abstaining from Signing on Abuja\\", hosted by Sudan Tribune, 15 June 2006  Notes and references  External links * Tim Sebastian, \\"Sudan: The suffering continues\\", HARDtalk interview of Diraige - BBC News, 4 August 2004 * SUDAN: Veteran Darfur leader blames conflict on marginalisation IRIN, November 2007 Category:Living people Category:Sudanese politicians Category:People from Darfur Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Sudanese expatriates in the United Kingdom ","title":"Ahmed Diraige"},{"id":"7705133","text":"You're Just Too Obscure for Me is a greatest hits album by New Zealand band The Verlaines, released in 2003 by Flying Nun Records.
