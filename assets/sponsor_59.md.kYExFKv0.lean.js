They can be grown by placing and watering the sprouted beans in the shade until the roots grow long. Mung bean sprouts are extensively cultivated and consumed in East Asia.  Cultivation  A variety of techniques are used for sprouting mung beans. A common technique for home growers is sprouting the beans in a jar, with a fine mesh or muslin cloth tied over the top with a rubber band or string. Fresh water is then poured into the jar three to four times a day; the jars are then upturned and left to drain. The precise growing technique to use depends on the amount that one wants to collect. The main principles are: selecting good seed (new and uniform), ensuring that light reaches the seeds, and also ensuring they receive enough humidity while avoiding waterlogging.

Facts The heads of a number of Christian private schools - Philip Williamson, Michael Bates, Grahame Davies, David Greenwood, Marianne Hosey, Paul Hubbard, Philip Moon, Anthony Seaton, and Matthew Walker - wished to use corporal punishment as a disciplinary device in their schools. The schools were Christian Fellowship School at Edge Hill, Liverpool, Bradford Christian School at Idle, Bradford, Cornerstone School at Epsom, Surrey, and King's School at Eastleigh, Hampshire. They claimed that the prohibition of corporal punishment in the Education Act 1996 s.548 was a breach of their freedom of religion under Article 9 ECHR.

Several subspecies and many forms have been described. 200px Lower image, female Description Morpho cypris replaces M. rhetenor in Colombia and Central America and one might strictly speaking unite it with the latter as a geographical branch unless the anatomy shows essential differences, M. cypris is here, however, kept separate on account of the rounded shape of the forewing and the somewhat more vertically placed white median band of the upper surface, M. cypris and M. helena outshine even the other Morphids in their incomparable gloss and M. cypris in particular is a true gem, unequalled in its brilliance throughout the whole of nature (Schatz). According to the fall of the light the blue of this incomparable insect shows a more violet or more greenish gloss and the delicate white band a yellowish tone or more of a tinge of rose colour. The blue is of such ethereal purity and such intensive lustre that all the other colours appear faded or dull in comparison. Only the Malayo-Australian Ornithoptera can outrival the Morphids, adding as they do to the brilliance of their golden green colouring the further charm of a quite distinguished form and wing contour. The scaling itself, as in M. rhetenor, remains fixed, but the interference scales are wanting in the normal females so that these are of the primitive yellowish ochreous (brassolid) ground colour common to all the species of the M. adonis group.Fruhstorfer, H., 1913.

It is found in Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. Description Hans Fruhstorfer describes: \\"M. rhetenor, already named by Cramer the 'blue elongate Atlas butterfly', has the apex of the forewing more produced than any other Morphid species; a characteristic, however, that partially disappears in the female, which more resembles that of cypris. The male is one of the most brilliantly glossy species and has only a quite inconsiderable black apical spot and a white costal patch on the forewing. The under surface is noteworthy for the contrast between the black basal area and a brown distal region, which are separated by a median band of a more or less pure white and of varying extent according to the locality. Both wings beneath show brown rounded eye-spots entirely without white pupils.\\" Sex difference Morpho rhetenor is sexually dimorphic. The female (shown in the Seitz plate below) is bigger than the bright blue male and has a dark-brown upperside with a lighter brown outer edge. There is a central yellow area tapering into a triangle and isolated patches as it crosses the forewings and a separate chain of yellow spots crosses the forewings and hindwings. Biology The larva feeds on Palmae and Macrolobium bifolium. Behaviour In 1913, Fruhstorfer wrote: \\"[forma] eusebes Fruhst. inhabits the Amazon region, where Michael has observed it at Obidos in August and September, and Dr. Hahnel at Iquitos and Jurimaguas. According to Dr. Hahnel (Iris 1890, p. 235) eusebes always flies at a great height and energetically, mounting from 3 to 6 m. with an undulating flight, and can only occasionally be attracted to fly down on to wings of Morpho menelaus laid on the ground. The female settles on wet places on the banks of rivers (a habit which I also observed in M. anaxibia in Sta. Catharina). When disturbed they only fly away slowly, in contrast to the males. The males emit a smell of sulphur (Hahnel 1.c. p. 308).\\" Etymology Rhetenor is a literary reference. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Rhetenor was a companion of Diomedes.

Bonnie Doon. The North‚ÄìSouth Pipeline, also known as the Sugarloaf Pipeline, is a water pipeline in Central Victoria, Australia, northeast of Melbourne that is part of Victoria's water system, acting as a link between Melbourne's water grid and the Murray-Goulburn water grid, supplying water via a series of existing and proposed pipelines. The 70-kilometre pipeline was connected to Melbourne in February 2010 to carry water from the Goulburn River to Melbourne‚Äôs Sugarloaf Reservoir. It is the government's policy that it only be used in times of critical human need: when Melbourne‚Äôs total water storages are less than 30% full on 30 November of any year.Melbourne Water, North‚ÄìSouth Pipeline The pipeline can transfer a portion of Lake Eildon‚Äôs water that is set aside for Melbourne, called the critical water reserve. This was 38,400 megalitres at 2 June 2014, and any changes are based on Goulburn-Murray Water‚Äôs advice. The North‚ÄìSouth Pipeline was presented through the late 2000s as being part of the Victorian Government's \\"Our Water, Our Future\\", which included other major projects such as the Wonthaggi desalination plant, the Cardinia Pipeline and a proposed interconnector to Geelong. The pipeline runs between a location on the Goulburn River, near Yea and heads south towards the Sugarloaf Reservoir north-east of Melbourne, along the Melba Highway. The Goulburn River is a major tributary of the Murray Darling river system and major agricultural region, whilst Sugarloaf Reservoir is a major storage reservoir for Melbourne's water supply. The pipeline cost $750 million and was delivered under an alliance model between Melbourne Water, John Holland, SKM and GHD. The pipeline is expected to add up to 75 billion litres annually to Melbourne's water supply, roughly one third of the 225 gigalitres (billion litres) proposed to be saved by irrigation and modernisation plans and projects in northern Victoria's Murray-Goulburn Irrigation District.Our Water Our Future water plan by Victorian Government The 225 gigalitres in savings is intended to be split 75 to Melbourne, 75 to irrigators and 75 to the watercourses themselves. Context In 2007, the Victorian Government announced the \\"Foodbowl Modernisation Plan\\" to save 225 gigalitres (GL) of water through a $1 billion investment in the Murray‚ÄìGoulburn Gravity Irrigation Districts. This was later increased to $2 billion with another 200 GL of savings identified. The Goulburn is Victoria's largest and longest river, accounting for an average annual flow of 3,040 GL per annum. Of this, about 700 GL is used within the Goulburn-Broken basin, and a further 850 GL transferred to irrigation areas outside the basin. After transmission losses of about 670 GL, a net outflow from the basin to the Murray of 350 GL remains. The population of the basin from this source is given as 100,000. Including Shepparton, Echuca and the tributary Broken catchment- it is estimated at 250,000. The notion of diverting water out of the Murray Darling Basin to provide urban water supply has stirred emotions among country and city residents. Diverting water between basins is not new however. The Snowy Mountains Scheme diverts Snowy River flows from its own catchment to the Murray Darling Basin in earlier decades. This source supplies 2,100 GL of water for generating power and providing irrigation water. This compares with the 75 GL contested water savings to be diverted out of the Basin for urban use. The population of Metropolitan Melbourne is approaching four million, accounting for 70% of the population of the State of Victoria.Department of Planning & Community Development: Victorian Population Bulletin 2009 Although most people in Victoria live in Melbourne, the city only uses 8% of the regulated surface water, the major portion going to irrigation supply. As of September 2009, Melbourne's water storages were less than 30% full prior to the onset of the drier summer period. This situation had generally worsened over the course of previous twelve years. Inflows into Melbourne's storages over that twelve-year period averaged almost 40% less than the previous long- term average. As of 2009, consumption in Melbourne was about 450 GL /year. With decreasing inflows to its water catchments and continuing population growth, a shortfall of supply of up to 200 GL / year is anticipated by 2055. A number of strategies have been proposed, including reducing individual consumer demand, recycling \\"grey\\" water and sewerage, various means of conservation, and sourcing additional water from elsewhere: including the Goulburn River and Kilcunda desalination plant. The strategy proposes to meet the projected shortfall of demand over existing supply 42% from conservation, and 53% from additional sources. South-eastern Australia has been experiencing widespread drought for the last 10‚Äì15 years that has been linked to human- induced climate change. This has impacted upon rainfall in the region. The amount of water in Melbourne's water storage dams has been decreasing for 11 years, since 1998, as a result of the latest cyclical drought, and restrictions on the use of water have been in place for much of that time.ABC News article on 3a water restrictions In June 2007, the Victorian Government released their water plan, Our Water Our Future. As part of this plan, the government announced its intention to develop a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant and construct a pipeline to augment Melbourne's water supply, as well as other regional supply systems. With the completion of the pipeline and desalination plant, it is anticipated that certain water restrictions will be removed.The Age article on removing water restrictions Route The pipeline traverses a distance of approximately 70 km from a location on the Goulburn River, near Yea () and heads in a south-southeast direction towards the Sugarloaf Reservoir () northeast of Melbourne. The route travels roughly alongside the Melba Highway, southwards, until it splits in its direction towards the reservoir. The pipeline's route cuts through parts of the Kinglake National Park and Toolangi State Forest.  Criticism and opposition  The North‚ÄìSouth Pipeline has been criticised by environmental groups, irrigators and communities directly affected by the pipeline, some suggesting that the project is politically influenced and founded on an incorrect interpretation of available data.D!ssent, Article by Kenneth Davidson \\"Water Lies\\", Issue 31 Summer 09/10 The Federal Opposition, Victorian Liberal Party, the National Party, and the Australian Greens opposed the pipeline,http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/11/26/2429660.htm with these objections detailed in the minority (dissenting) report section for the Water Amendment Bill 2008 (Saving the Goulburn and Murray Rivers),http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/eca_ctte/water_amendment_bill_2008/report/index.htm which also highlighted the many objections to the pipeline in the majority of submissions to the Senate Inquiry.http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/eca_ctte/water_amendment_bill_2008/submissions/sublist.htm Groups such as Plug the Pipe and the Victorian Farmers Federation and Watershed Victoria, also opposed the pipeline. Greenhouse gas emissions over a 100-year life are estimated at 13.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, the vast majority of which is generated by pumping water over the Great Dividing Range. The pipeline operator, Melbourne Water, states that only renewable energy is used for pumping and the system generates its own energy as water from the pipeline enters Sugarloaf Reservoir.\\"\\" On 20 October 2006 the Victorian Premier released a report \\"The Central Region Sustainable Water Strategy\\" in which the government claimed it wasn't viable to take water from the Goulburn Valley to Melbourne. The CSIRO has since released several reports of a similar opinion and has commented on the detrimental effect such a diversion may have on both the environment and the agricultural production. Victorian Premier, Mr Brumby, has responded to criticisms saying, \\"Our estimates on the Food Bowl are actually quite conservative ‚Ä¶ Even in the dry years you've got 690 gigalitres of water lost,\\" he said. \\"I'm more convinced than ever it's the right project.\\" On 4 January 2010, The Age newspaper published an analysis showing that \\"Melbourne may never need water from the controversial north‚Äìsouth pipeline, with a stocktake showing existing storages and minimal rainfall should easily supply the city beyond the start of the desalination plant next year.\\" In the Victorian state election in November 2010 a new government led by the Liberal Party's Ted Baillieu was elected. Baillieu has declared that his government will shut down the pipeline.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/30/3080351.htm?section=justin =Statistics withheld= Statistics relating to water saved by irrigation upgrades in the Goulburn-Murray district for the year to June 2009 were expected to be released by the State Government by the end of the year (31 December 2009). However, by 1 January 2010, the \\"Our Water Our Future\\" website still displayed the message that the savings would be released \\"before the end of 2009\\".The Age, Peter Ker \\"No sign of water savings figures\\", January 1, 2010 As The Age reported; \\"A spokesman for Water Minister Tim Holding said the audited savings would be released \\"shortly\\", but neither he nor the Department of Sustainability and Environment could offer a specific reason for the delay.\\" Environmental effects The Federal Government set conditions on construction of the pipeline under the Environmental Protection Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. In June, Friends of the Earth (FoE) released its report Out of sight, out of mind?. The group's assessment of the ecological impacts of the North South pipeline claimed that a 12 kilometre long, 30 metre wide corridor cleared through the Toolangi State Forest had affected at least four Special Protection Zones (SPZ). The Sugarloaf Pipeline Alliance prepared a compliance report on the pipeline which concluded that the known or possible habitats of a number of vulnerable species, including Matted Flax-lily, the Golden Sun Moth, Striped Legless Lizard, and Growling Grass Frog had been compromised during the construction of the pipeline.

In popular culture Several scenes of the 1974 released movie, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot starring Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges were filmed in Hobson, Montana. These scenes were shot in the summer of 1973 in the St. John's Lutheran Church, the adjacent wheat field and in the Black Bull Bar & Steakhouse.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072288/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt Hobson Church Found Follow-up to the article in the Reflections, Dec. 2010 Issue St. John‚Äôs Lutheran Church in Hobson, built in 1916 and closed in 1971, had been donated to another LCMS church across the state, only to disappear before it could make the 400 mile journey. But at least some of it made it at least 100 miles out of Hobson. Rev. Arlo Pullmann, the pastor at St. John in Lau-rel, remembers stories of his grandfather, who, along with other workers on the Great Northern Railway, bought land in Glacier Park and built cabins there. When his grandfather died, the Pullmann family was required to sell the land back to the Park Service. The cabin was dismantled and rebuilt in the Little Belt Mountains. Only a couple hours away, in Hobson, a couple was dismantling the St. John Church. The wood was sold and then used as flooring in the cabin, and somehow Marj Pullmann, Rev. Pullmann‚Äôs mother, ended up with the offering plates. From there she donated them to the District Office, only to be discovered by the district secretary, searching for answers on what happened to St. John‚Äôs church in Hobson.

Castaignet has created the \\"Mood pad\\", a proprietary technology enabling listeners to find intuitively music matching their mood (see Technology). Vavrille is the creator of Liveplasma.com, a graphic discovery engine. Liveplasma was created in 2004 and is a graphical interface based on Liveplasma technology. The Liveplasma technology creates a graphical map of possible tastes, with songs most likely to please the user appearing closer to the current song on the visual map than songs less similar. Musicovery webradio was beta-tested in June 2006 and launched in November 2006. After four years, a completely redesigned Musicovery website was launched in July 2010. The new version does not feature Liveplasma technology, and has many fewer features available in the free version of the site.http://absorbtheweb.com/musicovery-major-website-facelift/ An iPhone application was launched in September 2010. In January 2017 Musicovery closed its services to end-users and is now only supplying playlists to other streaming providers. The Musicovery team is based in Paris, France. Technology Musicovery relies on proprietary technology developed by its founders: * The \\"mood pad\\" technology: a music description methodology that enables to position any song on a 2 dimension continuous space (the ‚Äúmood pad‚Äù); songs are described with 40 musical parameters; The technology is the result of 3-year research on music description and human acoustic perception. The streaming music is at low quality 32kbit/s on the free platform, and at good quality 128kbit/s on the paid platform.http://www.musicovery.com/tarifs.php International service The music catalogs are specific for each country and the site is translated in local languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, and French). The interface is adapted to local specifications where appropriate (for instance, country and folk genres are added for the US audience). The popularity scale of each song, a parameter influencing music programming, is specific to each country.

In the museum relics of early Christian Ravenna are preserved, including fragments of mosaic from the first cathedral church, and the chapel of Sant'Andrea, dating from the Gothic kingdom. The main room, on entering, contains lapidary inscriptions as HIC REQUIESCIT IN PACE VIR SBL SEDA IGNUCUS ('Here lies in peace that eminent man Seda the Eunuch'), CUBICULARIUS or 'Bedchamberlain' to Theodoric the Great, buried 541 AD. Beneath this, by the window, a reliquary for the martyred saints Quiricus and Julietta, whose remains were carried from Tarsus, the birthplace of Saint Paul, to Auxerre and from thence to Ravenna. The depictions on its four facings are in keeping with the theme of donation: Galla Placidia placed it in the church of San Giovanni Battista (not to be confused with the church of the 'Evangelista'). They are: *Christ giving the Tables of the Law to St. Peter, with Paul standing by him; *Daniel in the lions' den, with the prophet Habakkuk offering him a loaf and fishes; *The Three Wise Kings bringing their gifts to the infant Christ; *The women sitting below at His empty tomb. The marble rosette on the facing wall is a Paschal calendar of the 6th century. Its purpose was to fix the movable feast of Easter in such a way that it might be celebrated everywhere in Christendom on the same day - no easy matter when East and West were using different calendars: the Eastern Church used the Hebrew lunar calendar, while the Western church followed the sun's cycle. Despite the decrees of the Council of Nicea in 325 AD and the tables of Theophilus, in this, as in all matters of faith, people followed their own loyalties. This calendar follows the eastern lunar cycle: LV on the outer rim, followed by AN indicates the phase of its 19-year cycle; the date then for Easter is written in each recurring phase from 532 AD to 626 AD. The mosaics are the few fragments left of what covered the apse of the first church: they are not Roman originals but of the early 12th century. The most beautiful and intact is that of the Madonna, praying in the eastern manner; other fragments give some idea of its composition - the life of Sant'Apollinare, the patron saint and evangeliser of Ravenna; scenes of the Resurrection; Saints Peter and Paul. On entering the room to the right, there is a little stele depicting Christ the Good Shepherd by a tree: it is the tombstone of Antiphon, who died aged 17 years, 5 months and 12 days, sometime at the end of the 2nd/beginning of the 3rd century, long before the Edict of Tolerance, and is thus the earliest Christian record in Ravenna. The red porphyrian man (drawing or sheathing his sword?), headless, handless, footless, may be the Emperor Theodosius. It recalls the statue of the Tetrarchs outside the Doge's Palace in Venice, gripping onto power. The jewel of the collection is the Ivory Cathedra, the bishop's seat of the Byzantine era (6th century), considered among the finest pieces of ivory carving in Western art. It is placed in what was the tower of Porta Salustra, the Roman gateway which commanded the southern entrance along the Cardis. It is the work of different hands and, even allowing for the missing panels, it still remains a visible masterpiece: the front bench, with the figures of Saint John the Baptist flanked by the Evangelists and a frieze work of peacocks, lions, goats and deer among vines, is especially fascinating; the backrest represents scenes from the birth of Christ, including Mary proving her virginity by immersion; on the other side, the miracles of Christ, his baptism and entry into Jerusalem; the armrests depict the Old Testament life of Joseph, reading from left to right (for the sitter). Chapel of Sant'Andrea The museum houses the private chapel of the bishop, built in the time of Theodoric (end of the 5th century) and dedicated to Sant'Andrea (Saint Andrew). A central feature is the little contemplation of the Word, encapsulated in the initials of Christ, and which reaffirms the Orthodox creed reigning, when the Arians had supremacy in Ravenna: The vault of the narthex, as you enter, is an exquisite working of blues and greens in which all the aquatic birdlife of Ravenna is interlaced; the lower parts have been restored cleverly with painted 'mosaic', including the inscription: Aut lux hic nata est, aut capta hic libera regnat (\\"Either light was born here or it was captured, [either way, here it] reigns freely\\") - which, apart from being a very fine appreciation of the art of mosaic, might be a cunning allusion to the 'Babylonian Captivity' of the Light, ('begotten not made') in the years of the Gothic occupation. Above the door is a lunette decorated with a young warrior Christ - the proud Roman soldier and not the Man of Sorrows, shouldering his cross, displaying the book which says I am the Way, the Truth and the Life; the lion and the snake he treads under foot are taken as the forces of evil (here, Arianism) which he defeats. Unfortunately, the chapel itself was heavily repainted with Renaissance frescoes (by Luca Longhi, a local artist) and marbling to give the same intimate feeling as the narthex. The apse has a starry sky which may have been inspired by the oratory of Galla Placidia; the vaulting has four angels arching inward to sustain the symbol of Christ: the initials I X = IesusXristos; between them, the symbols of the Evangelists and, in the vault of apse, portraits of the first Apostles Ss. Peter and Paul, James and Philip, Andrew and Jacob, with Christ, intent upon the Word and its interpretation. Even more than in the Christology of Galla Placidia, the Son of God is seen in the vault of Heaven: the Logos of the Cosmos. Robbed of earthly dominion, under Theodoric, the bishops of Ravenna contemplated celestial glory.Storia di Ravenna, Mario Pierpaoli; Longo editore, Ravenna, 1986;pp. 135-6 The chapel is included in the series of monuments of Ravenna classed by UNESCO as a world heritage site.

He was accused by Wyatt Earp of having taken part in an attempt to kill his brother, Virgil Earp. Diehl was not tried due to a lack of evidence.  Early life  Pony Diehl was probably the son of German Americans Jeremiah and Mary Hagler Ray and was born in about 1848 in Rock Island, Illinois.  Outlaw in New Mexico  He first appeared in New Mexico during the 1870s, riding with the John Kinney Gang, then later with the Jesse Evans Gang. While with the Kinney Gang, on December 31, 1875, Diehl, John Kinney, Jesse Evans, and gang member Jim McDaniels entered a saloon in Las Cruces, New Mexico. There, they became involved in a brawl with US Cavalry soldiers from Fort Stanton. A Private was beaten so badly he died four days later. Kinney was also severely injured and his friends carried him outside, and then turned around and shot through the doors and windows of the saloon at the soldiers. According to different accounts, they killed one or two soldiers and a civilian outright and wounded three soldiers or two soldiers and another civilian. Diehl rode with the Kinney Gang through 1875. In early 1876 he left the Kinney gang to join Jesse Evans, who had also left Kinney to form own gang. The men were actively involved in cattle rustling and armed robbery, and were joined for a while by Billy the Kid. They were enlisted into supporting the \\"Murphy-Dolan Faction\\" in their feud with John Tunstall in Lincoln, New Mexico. Billy the Kid, a friend of Tunstall, left the gang. When the remaining gang members killed Tunstall, they sparked the Lincoln County War, during which Evans and his gang fought Billy the Kid and his \\"Regulators\\".  Life in Tombstone, Arizona  After the Lincoln County War, Diehl left New Mexico. He joined \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius and \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson in late 1878 on a cattle drive to Arizona Territory and Tombstone. He became part of a loose federation of outlaw Cochise County Cowboys that included Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, Johnny Ringo and \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius. Diehl was suspected of being involved in numerous robberies and cattle rustling in the Arizona Territory. He was suspected of being involved in the theft of U.S. Army mules with Sherman McMaster, who Diehl may have known as a child. = Ambush of Virgil Earp = On the evening of December 28, 1881, Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp was returning from the Oriental Saloon to the Cosmopolitan Hotel when he was ambushed. Assailants on the second story of an unfinished building across Allen street from the hotel shot Virgil in the back and left arm. He was hit by three loads of buckshot from double-barreled shotguns from about . Dr. George E. Goodfellow was able to save Virgil's arm, but he carried it in a sling the rest of his life. On January 30, 1882 Wyatt Earp obtained warrants from Judge Stilwell for the arrest of Diehl, along with Ike and Phin Clanton, for the attempted murder of Virgil. He gathered a posse which turned Charleston inside out looking for the Cowboys without success. Wyatt returned to Tombstone to find the men had already surrendered, though they thought it was for lesser charges. Though Ike's hat was found at the scene where the ambushers waited, a number of associates stood up for him, saying that he had been in Contention that night, and the case against Pony Diehl, Ike, and Phin was dismissed for lack of evidence. In February 1882, Wyatt Earp obtained another warrant for Diehl's arrest for his alleged participation to a January 1882 stagecoach robbery. Diehl dodged the law when Earp could not find him. = Earp Vendetta Ride = After attending a theater show on March 18, Morgan Earp was assassinated by gunmen firing from a dark alley through a door window into a room where he was playing billiards. The bullet shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry. Another round narrowly missed Wyatt. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch. The assassins escaped in the dark and Morgan died forty minutes later. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp felt he could not rely on the courts for justice and decided to take matters into his own hands. He concluded that the only way to deal with Morgan's assassins was to kill them all. He formed a federal posse and set out in search of those he believed were responsible for attacking his brothers. At Pete Spence's wood camp in the Dragoon Mountains, they found and killed Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz. Two days later, near Iron Springs (later Mescal Springs), in the Whetstone Mountains, they were seeking to rendezvous with a messenger for them. They unexpectedly stumbled onto the wood camp of Curly Bill Brocius, including Diehl and other Cowboys. According to reports from both sides, the two sides immediately exchanged gun fire. Wyatt killed Curly Bill and mortally wounded Johnny Barnes. Diehl was unhurt. = Death of Michael O'Rourke = Diehl later claimed he had killed gambler and Earp supporter Michael O'Rourke in 1882. According to Fred Dodge, Frank Leslie told him that O'Rourke shot Ringo in the head and tried to make it look like suicide. Diehl was a good friend of Johnny Ringo. Those who understood the tensions between the parties never doubted he had killed O'Rourke.  Later life  Diehl was later arrested for a variety of crimes, including cattle rustling and robbery, and was sentenced to five years in prison at Santa Fe, New Mexico. He escaped in February, 1885, but was recaptured four days later. He was returned to prison and was finally released in March, 1887, where his name disappeared from public records, though there are some accounts he died in a gunfight.

It is about from Kuknur and from Lakkundi. Mahadeva Temple Profile of Mahadeva Temple at Itagi (or Ittagi) in the Koppal district, Karnataka Mahadeva Temple at Itagi (or Ittagi) in the Koppal district, 1112 CE, an example of dravida articulation with a nagara superstructure The Mahadeva Temple was built based on the general plan of the Amruteshwara Temple at Annigeri (used as the prototype). The Mahadeva Temple has the same architectural components; there is a difference in their articulation. The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi was built circa 1112 CE by Mahadeva, a commander (dandanayaka) in the army of the Western Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI. Itagi is about east of Gadag and west of Hampi. The temple is dedicated to Hindu God Shiva. The well-executed sculptures, finely crafted carvings on walls, pillars and the tower make it a good example of complete Western Chalukyan art which speaks volumes about the taste of the Chalukyan artisans. An inscription dated 1112 CE in the temple calls it \\"Emperor among Temples\\" (Devalaya Chakravarti).Cousens (1926), p. 101Kamath (2001), pp. 117‚Äì118 Art historian Henry Cousens called this monument the \\"finest in Kannada country after Halebidu\\".Quote:\\"A title it fully deserves, for it is probably the finest temple in Kanarese districts, after Halebidu\\" (Cousens 1926, p101) These Western Chalukya monuments, regional variants of existing dravida (South Indian) temples, defined the Karnata dravida tradition.Hardy (1995), pp. 6‚Äì7 The Mahadeva temple is officially protected as a national monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. Details =Temple plan= The temple plan consists of a shrine (cella) which is connected to a closed mantapa (hall) by a vestibule (antechamber). The closed mantapa leads to an open pillared mantapa, with the temple as a whole facing the east. Some parts of the temple, such as the cornice and parapet over the outer edge of the roof of the open mantapa are missing.Cousens (1926), p. 100 The main temple, the sanctum of which has a linga (symbol of Shiva), is surrounded by thirteen minor shrines, each with its own linga. The temple has two other shrines, dedicated to Murthinarayana and Chandraleshwari, parents of Mahadeva, the Chalukya commander who consecrated the temple. The closed mantapa has a doorway on each side, with the eastern doorway leading to the open mantapa and the western doorway to the sanctum. The door panels are well wrought and the ceiling of the porches have a ribbed design in them. The decoration of the outer walls follows the same pattern as that of the shrine. The great open mantapa has 64 pillars, 24 of which are full pillars which start from the floor and support the main ceiling. The remaining are half pillars (or \\"dwarf pillars\\") which start from the bench (parapet wall) that surrounds the mantapa and support the sloping eaves. The pillars in this hall bear similarities to the porch pillars at the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal and the lathe-turned pillars (whose rounded sections are lathe-turned) at the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi. The square ceiling of the open mantapa which are supported by the four central pillars exhibits interesting fretted stonework. The ceiling here has been worked into a decorative arabesque foliage and makaras (mythical beasts) which flow from the mouth of a Kirtimukha (gargoyle or demon face). This type of stonework is considered as high a quality as any. In stark contrast, the interior of the closed mantapa and the sanctum are plain and simple. It is believed that bracket figures that once adorned the outside pillars are now missing. These forward leaning bracket figures (Salabhanjika), which normally represent female forms in various poses (such as dancing or adorning themselves), would have rested on small blocks on the shaft of the pillars (capital), finding support from the underside of the overhanging cornice via a slot in their upper end.Cousens (1926), p. 102 See also *Hampi *Anegondi *Kuknur *Kanakagiri *Yelburga *Koppal *Karnataka Gallery File:Kirthimukha at Mahadeva Temple in Itagi.jpgKirtimukha on superstructure of Vimana File:Ornate pillared mantapa leading to the shrine in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi.jpgMantapa (hall) with lathe turned pillars at the Mahadeva Temple File:Vesara shrine and superstructure in the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district.JPGVimana of Mahadeva temple with decorative articulation Image:Mahadeva_temple_Itagi_5.jpgMahadeva Temple at Itagi (or Ittagi) in the Koppal district, Karnataka Image:Ornate_porch_entrance_with_decorative_door_jamb,_lintel_and_domical_ceiling_in_Mahadeva_temple_at_Itagi.jpgPorch entrance with ornate pillars and domical ceiling at Mahadeva Temple, Itagi Image:Old Kannada inscription (1112 CE) of King Vikramaditya VI in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi.jpgOld Kannada inscription (1112 CE) honouring the temple as \\"Emperor among temples\\" Image:Door panel decoration at Mahadeva Temple in Itagi.jpgDoorjamb decoration on porch at Mahadeva Temple File:A minor shrine on the mantapa inner wall in the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district.JPGMinor shrine inside the closed mantapa of the Mahadeva temple at Itagi File:Decorative lintel and door jamb with domical ceiling in the lateral entrance to the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district.JPG Decorative lintel and door jamb with domical ceiling in the lateral entrance to the Mahadeva temple at Itagi File:Decorative door jamb and lintel over the entrance to the sanctum in the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district.JPGDecorative door jamb and lintel over the entrance to the sanctum in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi File:Lintel relief over entrance to sanctum in the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district.JPGLintel relief over entrance to sanctum in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi File:Hall pillar pedestal relief in the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district.JPGHall pillar pedestal relief in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi File:Profile of Vesara tower and shrine in the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district 1.JPGProfile of Vesara tower and shrine in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi File:Profile of wall relief in the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district.JPGProfile of wall relief in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi Notes  References    External links  Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1112 Category:12th-century Hindu temples Category:Hindu temples in Koppal district Category:History of Karnataka Category:Chalukya dynasty Category:Shiva temples in Karnataka ","title":"Mahadeva Temple, Itagi"},{"id":"17456063","text":"Friedrich Heinrich Albert Wangerin (November 18, 1844 - October 25, 1933) was a German mathematician.

He studied at the gymnasium at Greifenberg and completed his final examination with an \\"excellent\\" grade in 1862. In spring 1862, Wangerin entered the University of Halle-Wittenberg, where he studied Mathematics and Physics. He was taught by mathematicians Eduard Heine and Carl Neumann. In 1864 he moved to the University of K√∂nigsberg. He worked under the supervision of German mathematician Franz Ernst Neumann. He competed his doctorate from K√∂nigsberg University on March 16, 1866. His doctorate thesis was De annulis Newtonianis. Academic career After he completing his doctorate, Wangerin took the examinations to become a school teacher. From 1866 to 1867, he trained at the Friedrichswerdersche Gymnasium, Berlin. From 1867 to 1876, he taught mathematics at several gymnasiums. Wangerin became Professor at the University of Berlin in 1876. He taught mathematics to the first year undergraduates. He left the University of Berlin in 1882 and became ordinary professor at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. The chair of ordinary professor had fallen vacant because of the death of Eduard Heine, the former teacher of Wangerin. Wangerin held professorship at Halle for more than thirty five years. During the academic year 1910-11, he was rector of the university. He retired in 1919. Later life After the retirement, Wangerin continued to live in Halle. He was active in mathematical research. He died on October 25, 1933 in Halle. Work Wangerin was known for his research on potential theory, spherical functions and differential geometry. He wrote an important two volume treatise on potential theory and spherical functions. Theorie des Potentials und der Kugelfunktionen I was published in 1909 and Theorie des Potentials und der Kugelfunktionen II was published in 1921. He studied Wangerin functions. Wangerin was also known for writing of textbooks, encyclopaedias and his historical writings.

This Museum was an idea of the architect Carlos Colombino, and was inaugurated on 14 August 1996. a journey through its different spaces will allow to make a reading of Asuncion's history, in its different phases of development. The objects that it treasures had been collected in the country, as well as in the cities of New York City, Madrid, Paris, Montevideo and Buenos Aires.  CASA VIOLA  The Viola house is a typical colonial construction dated from 1750‚Äì1758, its location answers to the disposition of the streets before doctor Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia squared the city. The house has a tile roof. There is a gallery in front; behind the gallery there is a blacksmith's shop built over wooden beams and columns. Previously, the house had three big rooms, now there's only one, located in front of the government. In the back part there is a passing gallery, as a sample of the culata yovai, type of antique Paraguayan houses. The roof is made of palm and tacuara; the tiles are set with a mud kind of cement.  History  Alter the change of government in 1989, people wanted to restore few places in town. In this context, a group of architecture students Start the campaign \\"Salvemos la Manzana frente al palacio\\" which means \\"let‚Äôs save the block in front of the government palace\\", due to the damage of the construction and in opposition to a project that pretend to demolish to build a park in its place. Due to the celebration of the 500 years of America's discovery, there were established through all Iberoamerica some commissions to organize few actions about it. The Comisi√≥n V Centenario Paraguay, presided by the architect Juan Cristaldo, includes the Project Casa Viola, among the principal projects to be done, which was presented by the writer Augusto Roa Bastos in front of the Agencia Espa√±ola de Cooperaci√≥n Internacional (Spanish agency of international cooperation). During the administration of the mayor Jos√© Luis Alder, Asuncion's town hall acquired the property that of in the property of the Manzana. The restoration works started in 1991, year in which the buildings started to function again to turn it into the cultural centre of the city. Its first principal was the architect Carlos Colombino. The visit to this Museum allows a double reading through one of the facts that happened since the foundation of the city, and another one through the chronicles of its protagonists. In the Museum we can appreciate different ritual elements appertaining to the guarani culture, as a pre-Hispanic undertaker's. there's also a genealogical tree of enlightened men and women of the nation, paintings by many Paraguayan artists, that reflect the way of living in Asunci√≥n through the different periods, geographical maps, statistics and historical information, city maps of Asunci√≥n and the neighbor countries, from the 17th and 18th centuries, furnitures, journals, books, shields, magazines, scores, candlesticks, colonial objects, as various building elements. In the year 2005, with the sponsoring of the United States embassy, the conservation and restoration Project of the heap started.

For the fabrication of objects they used a pottery decorated with fingers and natural dyeing. In the Museum you can appreciate an urn, used to bury their dead people.

The museum features more than eighty simple science experiments, focusing mainly on physics, for children as well as for adults. In addition to regular visitor hours, the Center hosts school and other groups. It also sponsors special events in science education, such as Nano Days and provides family-friendly activities for major events such as Homecoming Weekend and the Otsego County Fair. History The museum was the result of the hard work and dedication of Albert Read, a physics professor at SUNY Oneonta from 1957‚Äì1985. After his retirement, he planned and designed the Center and housed it in a room formerly used for batting practice. The official dedication took place on January 21, 1990. From its opening in 1990, to the time of Read's retirement as director in 2005, the museum doubled the number of exhibits and served an estimated 7,000 visitors per year. The Center is part of the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) and some of the exhibits developed by Read were included in the ASTC \\"Cheapbook\\" exhibit guide series.A. J. Read pers. communic., Cheapbook 1 by Paul Orselli, currently out-of-print Following Read's retirement, Dr. Hugh Gallagher served as director. In 2006, the Center received a $100,000 state grant to expand its outreach to local elementary and secondary teachers, provide additional education resources for teachers and students, and improve the facility. \\"I'm thrilled that the College will have this tremendous opportunity to enhance such a valuable community resource,\\" said Dr. Gallagher. \\"The unique collection of hands-on science exhibits offers people of all ages a way to touch and feel the physical sciences.\\" The grant was used to re-decorate the center, develop new exhibits, and enhancing the interactivity of other exhibits. The work of the Center was described in a faculty research presentation \\"Science Discovery Center: A Resource for Curricular Enhancement for Many Disciplines\\" by Hugh Gallagher (Physics & Astronomy), Carolyn Chryst (Elementary Education & Reading), Jenny Flynn (SUNY Oneonta Headstart), Paul French (Physics &Astronomy;), Kelly Gallagher (Chemistry & Biochemistry), Larry Guzy(Psychology), Crystal Hamm (SUNY Oneonta Headstart), Sunil Labroo, Carolyn McCruden, Albert Read (Physics & Astronomy), David Tagg (Music). Paul French served as director until September 2015. In 2015, the Center celebrated its 25th anniversary, and was renamed the \\"A. J. Read Science Discovery Center\\" in honor of the contributions of its founding director. At that time, the Center had been temporarily moved from the Physical Science Building to the 3rd floor of Bugbee Hall. In 2017, the Center moved into a new space following the renovation of the Physical Sciences building. In September 2016, Douglas Reilly was named Outreach Coordinator to work with the A. J.

Late 17th-18th century (Qing dynasty), 9.7 cm (3.8 in) tall Dehua porcelain statue of Guanyin, Ming Dynasty Dehua porcelain (), more traditionally known in the West as Blanc de Chine (French for \\"White from China\\"), is a type of white Chinese porcelain, made at Dehua in the Fujian province. It has been produced from the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) to the present day. Large quantities arrived in Europe as Chinese export porcelain in the early 18th century and it was copied at Meissen and elsewhere. It was also exported to Japan in large quantities.  History  The area along the Fujian coast was traditionally one of the main ceramic exporting centers. Over one- hundred and eighty kiln sites have been identified extending in historical range from the Song period to present. The two principal kiln sites were those of Qudougong () and Wanpinglun (). The Wanpinglun site is the older of the two and manufactured pressed wares and others. The kilns of Dehua also produced other ceramic wares, including some with under glaze blue decoration. From the Ming period porcelain objects were manufactured that achieved a fusion of glaze and body traditionally referred to as \\"ivory white\\" and \\"milk white.\\" The special characteristic of Dehua porcelain is the very small amount of iron oxide in it, allowing it to be fired in an oxidising atmosphere to a warm white or pale ivory color. This color makes it instantly recognizable and quite different from the porcelain from the Imperial kilns of Jingdezhen, which contains more iron and has to be fired in reduction (i.e., an atmosphere with carbon dioxide) if it is not to appear an unpleasant straw color.Wood, N., Chinese Glazes: Their Chemistry, Origins and Re-creation, A & C Black, London, and University of Pennsylvania Press, USA, 2007 The unfired porcelain body is not very plastic but vessel forms have been made from it. Donnelly lists the following types of product: figures, boxes, vases and jars, cups and bowls, fishes, lamps, cup-stands, censers and flowerpots, animals, brush holders, wine and teapots, Buddhist and Taoist figures, secular figures and puppets. There was a large output of figures, especially religious figures, e.g., Guanyin, Maitreya, Luohan and Ta-mo figures. Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, was particularly revered in Fujian and there exist innumerable figures of her. Donnelly says, ‚ÄúThere is no doubt that figures constitute the great glory of blanc de Chine.‚Äù Some have been produced with little modification from the late 16th or early 17th century.Donnelly, P.J., Blanc de Chine, Faber and Faber, London, 1969 Crisply modeled figures with a smooth white glaze were popular as were joss-stick holders, brush pots, Dogs of Fo, libation cups and boxes. The devotional objects produced at Dehua (incense burners, candlesticks, flower vases and statuettes of saints) ‚Äúconformed to the official stipulations of the early Ming period, not only in their whiteness but also in imitating the shape of archaic ritual objects‚Äù.Ayers, J. and Bingling, Y., Blanc de Chine: Divine Images in Porcelain, China Institute, New York, 2002 They were probably used in the domestic shrines that every Chinese home possessed. However, one Confucian polemicist, Wen Zhenheng (1585‚Äì1645), specifically forbade the use of Dehua wares for religious purposes, presumably for their lack of antiquity: ‚ÄúAmong the censers the use of which should be specifically forbidden are those recently made in the kilns of Fujian (Dehua).‚Äù The numerous Dehua porcelain factories today make figures and tableware in modern styles. During the Cultural Revolution ‚ÄúDehua artisans applied their very best skills to produce immaculate statuettes of the Great Leader and the heroes of the revolution. Portraits of the stars of the new proletarian opera in their most famous roles were produced on a truly massive scale.‚Äù Mao Zedong figures later fell out of favor but have been revived for foreign collectors. Precise dating of blanc de Chine of the Ming and Qing (1644‚Äì1911) dynasties is often difficult because the conservatism of the Dehua potters led them to produce similar pieces for decades or even for centuries. There are blanc de Chine figures being made in Dehua today (e.g. the popular Guanyin and Maitreya figures) little different from those made in the Ming dynasty. Notable artists in blanc de Chine, such as the late Ming period He Chaozong, signed their creations with their seals. Wares include crisply modeled figures, cups, bowls and joss stick-holders. In Japan Dehua kiln statue of Buddhist Kannon used for Christian veneration in Japan Many of the best examples of blanc de Chine can also be found in Japan where they are used in family altars (butsudan) and other funerary and religious uses. In Japan the white variety was termed hakuji, hakugorai or \\"Korean white\\", a term often found in tea ceremony circles. The British Museum in London has a large number of blanc de Chine pieces, having received the entire collection of P.J.Donnelly as a gift in 1980.Harrison-Hall, J., Ming Ceramics in the British Museum, British Museum, London, 2001 Dehua white porcelain was traditionally known in Japan as hakugorai or ‚ÄúKorean White Ware.‚Äù Although Korai was a term for an ancient Korean kingdom, the term also functioned as a ubiquitous term for various products from the Korean peninsula. The Japanese knew of the existence of the Fujian province kilns and their porcelain, now known as Dehua or Blanc de Chine ware. The Dehua kilns are located in Fujian province opposite the island of Taiwan. Coastal Fujian province was traditionally a trade center for the Chinese economy with its many ports and urban centers. Fujian white ware was meant for export to all of maritime Asia. However a large quantity of these ceramics was intended for a Japanese market, before drastic trade restrictions by the mid 17th century. Items were largely Buddhist images and ritual utensils utilized for family altar use. An association with funerals and the dead has perhaps led to a disinterest in this ware among present day Japanese, despite a strong interest in other aspects of Chinese ceramic culture and history. The very plain white incense tripods and associated objects for Japanese religious and ritual observance are also likely designed specifically for a Japanese market, as are the Buddhist Goddesses of Mercy with child figurines that closely resemble the Christian Madonna and Child. Such figurines were known as Maria Kannon or ‚ÄúBlessed Virgin Goddesses of Mercy‚Äù and were part of the ‚Äúhidden Christian‚Äù culture of Tokugawa Japan which had strictly banned the religion. White porcelain Buddhist statuary was extensively produced in Japan at the Hirado kilns and elsewhere. The two wares can be easily distinguished. Japanese figures are usually closed on the base and a small hole for ventilation can be seen. Hirado Ware also displays a slightly orange tinge on unglazed areas.

The use of earlier reign marks has a long history in China, much to the vexation of modern researchers, and was intended to indicate respect rather than to deceive. The teapot's bold geometric design anticipates the forms of European modernism by more than two centuries.

Early life and career  Pettine started to study the mandolin with Camille Mastropaolo at a very early age. After the Pettine family emigrated to the United States in 1889 and settled in Providence, Rhode Island, Giuseppe was regarded as a child prodigy of the mandolin because of his great concert appearances. Raffaele Calace (1863‚Äì1934) dedicated his First Mandolin Concerto op. 113 to Pettine, his fellow countryman and friend, in honor of his skills and passion for the mandolin. Pettine was a member of the Big Trio, a trio formed by guitarist William Foden, banjoist Frederick Bacon and Giuseppe Pettine on mandolin. He published a mandolin method book in 1896, and a comprehensive seven-volume tutorial for the mandolin, titled Pettine's Modern Mandolin School.Providence, Rhode Island, Rhode Island Music Company, Pettine's Modern Mandolin School by Giuseppe Pettine He also became a teacher of the Italian mandolin technique. Members of his school of American mandolinists include William Place Jr. (1889‚Äì1959) and Alfonso Balasone (Albert Bellson, 1897‚Äì1977). Today the Pettine method is still regarded as one of the most comprehensive works for mandolin ever published.  Mandolin design  Besides these activities Pettine was concerned with the development and production of fine mandolins. For this he worked in close cooperation with the well-known VEGA musical instrument manufacturers company in Boston, creating the \\"Giuseppe Pettine Special\\" model, a soloist mandolin modelled after the modern Neapolitan mandolin designed by the Vinaccia luthier family of Naples.  Composer  1914 advertisement for mandolin instruction books by Pettine from the book The Guitar and Mandolin by Philip J. Bone. As a composer he greatly contributed to the mandolin repertoire, writing original music for solo mandolin and mandolin in combination with other instruments. Works include his published three-movement concerto titled Concerto Patetico for mandolin and piano accompaniment. This concerto also exists in an unpublished incomplete version for solo mandolin and orchestra consisting of winds and plucked instruments. The orchestra parts were written for first and second mandolin, mandola, mandoloncello, bass, tenor banjo, flute, piccolo flute, clarinet in A, bassoon, horn in F and timbales. Another of Pettine's compositions for solo mandolin is his Fantasia Romantica, a substantial work in which he emphasizes the wonderful possibilities of the instrument by including seldom-heard harmonics, both natural and artificial, with chord arpeggios and virtuosic scale passages. Not all of Pettine's works were for the mandolin. In 1925, he published 44 Solos in Duo Style, a book of moderate- to advanced-level etudes and solo pieces for the tenor banjo. According to the book's preface, it was written twenty-five years after his \\"systematized 'Duo School' for the Mandolin\\" and was \\"the first complete book on the 'Duo Style of Tenor Banjo Playing'.\\"  Praise  George C. Krick (1871‚Äì1962), a well- known guitarist, mandolinist, and contemporary of Pettine, wrote, \\"The man who undoubtedly has contributed more than anyone else to the American literature of the mandolin is Giuseppe Pettine.\\" And \\"His concert repertoire includes many of the great violin concertos and original compositions and his concert tours have taken him from Maine to California. Amongst his numerous compositions the Concerto Patetico, for mandolin and piano, is his greatest contribution to mandolin literature.\\"George C Krick, \\"The Mandolin\\", √âtude, February 1938, Volume LVI, Number 2, page 127-128 Pettine died in 1966.

He organised the important French Resistance network SCIENTIST, in southwest France from August 1942 to March 1943 and in Brittany from February 1944 onwards. His elder sister Lise was also an SOE agent. World War II His first mission came on 30 July 1942, when he and his radio operator Harry Peulev√© were parachuted in from a Halifax near N√Æmes to set up and head the SCIENTIST network. However, they were dropped from too low an altitude and landed badly ‚Äì de Baissac broke his ankle and Peulev√© was so badly hurt he had to return to England. In the following months, de Baissac developed the SCIENTIST network in the Bordeaux region, receiving reinforcements in the form of Roger Landes (codenamed Stanislas, his new radio operator, dropped on 2 November) and Mary Herbert (codenamed Marie- Louise, his liaison officer, landed by boat on 8 November). Certain resistance group concentrated their efforts for a joint attack on the submarine pens in the port and other operations in the Landes countryside. As explained by Paddy Ashdown in a BBC Timewatch documentary, due to \\"a Whitehall cock-up of major proportions\\", de Baissac was preparing to take explosives on board German ships in the harbour of Bordeaux when he heard explosions from the partly successful Operation Frankton. Had the Royal Marines of Operation Frankton cooperated with de Baissac, they could have jointly dealt a stronger blow, but SOE's policy of secrecy even from other parts of the British Forces prevented this. De Baissac worked closely with Francis Suttill and his Prosper-PHYSICIAN network in Paris, before briefly returning to London on the night of 17/18 March 1943 in a LysanderHugh Verity, We landed by moonlight (as the book does not give a precise date for his return to France, Claude de Baissac must have been parachuted in) to announce that the network had 11,000 men at its disposal. In May 1943, Suttill warned de Baissac that he thought Henri D√©ricourt, a member of SCIENTIST, was working for the Germans just before de Baissac was parachuted back in at the full moon with new instructions. The parachute drops of men and supplied intensified, but on 23 June the Gestapo captured Suttill and hundreds of other agents and Resistance workers from Prosper-PHYSICIAN and other networks and attached groups. The SCIENTIST network was caught up in PHYSICIAN's fall and on the night of 16/17 August, Claude, Lise and Nicholas Bodington returned to England by Lysander, with Roger Landes (Aristide) replacing Claude at the head of SCIENTIST until November 1943. In February 1944 de Baissac was parachuted into Mayenne with an all-Mauritian team made up of his sister Lise, captain Jean-Marie Renaud- Danticolle (codenamed Ren√©) and the radio operator Maurice Louis Larcher (code named Vladimir). His new mission was to amalgamate, arm and energise the Resistance groups in the region stretching from Caen to Laval. When D-Day came, he joined George Starr and his WHEELWRIGHT network in the south-west. Family After the war he and Mary Herbert married.

During 1982 the NHC started to include data on Central Pacific tropical storms and hurricanes within the database, before they took over the responsibility for issuing advisories during 1988. The format of the Eastern Pacific database was subsequently significantly changed during 2013 to include non-synoptic best track times and non-developing tropical depressions. The Atlantic hurricane database During 1959, a technical paper was published by the United States Weather Bureau, which consolidated several sources of records in to a single publication. These sources included annual summaries that had been published in the Monthly Weather Review at various times since 1922, unpublished materials from the Hurricane forecast offices and other studies on hurricanes and hurricane climatology back to around 1886. While combining the sources, position errors of over were found for several hurricanes shown in more than one source. Therefore, the positions of all of the systems that were considered to have tropical characteristics, were compared with the historical weather maps of the daily synoptic series. The most reliable positions and intensities were then plotted on a series of annual track charts, before being reviewed by the hurricane forecast centres, Extended Forecast Section and the National Hurricane Research Project. The most accurate and consistent locations from the reviews were then plotted on the maps and published. This dataset was subsequently updated during 1965, which extended the dataset back to 1871 and forwards to 1963 based on additional material. At around this time, NASA's Apollo space programme requested data, on the climatological impacts of tropical cyclones on launches of space vehicles at the Kennedy Space Center. The basic data was taken by the authors from the National Weather Records North Atlantic Tropical Cyclone deck number 988, which was updated and corrected to include data from 1886‚Äì1968. As a result of this work, a requirement for a computerized tropical cyclone database at the National Hurricane Centre (NHC) was realised, which led to the prediction of tropical cyclone motion out through 72 hours. Over the next few years, HURDAT was extensively revised, by both the NHC and the National Climatic Center, before it was published at irregular intervals. Over the next couple of decades, it became obvious that the database needed to be revised because it was incomplete, contained significant errors, or did not reflect the latest scientific understanding regarding the interpretation of past data. Charles J Neumann subsequently documented several of these problems and obtained a grant, to start addressing them in a programme that was eventually called the Atlantic Hurricane Database Re-analysis Project. During the 1990s Jose Fernandez-Partagas led efforts to document previously undocumented tropical cyclones from the mid 1800s until the early 1900s, by using lists of previous hurricanes, books and newspapers.http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/Partagas/1851-1857/Intro_51-57.pdf After his death in 1997, the results of his efforts were built upon by the Atlantic reanalysis team, before being checked by NHC's Best Track Committee and added in to the Atlantic HURDAT in 2001 and 2003.http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/rpibook-final04.pdf In 2013, the archive's format was significantly changed to include non-synoptic best track times, non-developing tropical depressions and wind radii. The Eastern and Central Pacific hurricane database The Eastern Pacific best track database was initially compiled on magnetic tape in 1976 for the seasons between 1949 and 1975, at the NHC to help with the development of two tropical cyclone forecast models, which required tracks of past cyclones as a base for its predictions. The database was based on records held by the United States Navy and were interpolated from 12 hourly intervals to 6 hourly intervals based on a scheme devised by Hiroshi Akima in 1970. Initially tracks for the Central Pacific region and tracks for tropical depressions that did not develop into tropical storms or hurricanes were not included within the database. After the database had been created Arthur Pike of the NHC made some internal adjustments, while in 1980 a review was made by Arnold Court under contract from the United States National Weather Service and resulted in additions and/or modifications to 81 tracks in the database. Between 1976 and 1987, the NHC archived best track data from the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC), and in 1982 started including information on Central Pacific tropical storms and hurricanes started to be included in the database based on data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and research done by Samuel Shaw of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) in 1981. The format of the database was completely revised by the NHC in 1984, so that the format could resemble the Atlantic database before they took over the warning responsibility from the EPHC for the Eastern Pacific in 1988. In 2008 and in 2013, several revisions were made to the database to extend tracks over land, based on reports in the Mariners Weather Log and extrapolation of the tracks since the EPHC stopped issuing advisories on systems before they made landfall. The archive's format was significantly changed in 2013 to include non-synoptic best track times, non-developing tropical depressions and wind radii. In February 2016, the NHC released the 1959 Mexico hurricane's reanalysis, which was the first system to be reassessed using methods developed for the Atlantic reanalysis process. Reanalysis projects After the HURDAT databases were created; it became obvious over the next couple of decades that HURDAT needed to be revised because it was incomplete, contained significant errors, or did not reflect the latest scientific understanding regarding the interpretation of past data. In 2013, the archive's format was significantly changed to include non- synoptic best track times, non-developing tropical depressions and wind radii. During March 2014, the Atlantic HURDAT was updated with the results of the reanalysis for the seasons between 1946 and 1950, with nine tropical storms added to the database.http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/news/20140325_pa_reanalysis1946to1950.pdf Hurricane Camille's reanalysis was expedited and published during April 2014, after the National Hurricane Center management realised a need to answer the question: \\"Which is the strongest hurricane to have struck the United States?\\" During 2015 and 2016, HURDAT was revised with the results of the reanalysis for the seasons between 1951 and 1955, with 12 new tropical storms added to the database.http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/news/20150518_pa_reanalysis.pdf References Category:Atlantic hurricanes Category:Pacific hurricanes Category:Scientific databases ","title":"HURDAT"},{"id":"17456219","text":"The Case for Animal Rights is a 1983 book by the American philosopher Tom Regan, in which the author argues that at least some kinds of non-human animals have moral rights because they are the \\"subjects-of-a-life,\\" and that these rights adhere to them whether or not they are recognized.Rowlands 1998, pp. 59‚Äì60. The work is considered an important text within animal rights theory. Arguments Regan's position is Kantian (though Immanuel Kant himself did not apply it to non-humans), namely that all subjects-of-a life possess inherent value and must be treated as ends-in-themselves, never as a means to an end. He also argues that, while being the subject-of-a-life is a sufficient condition for having intrinsic value, it is not a necessary one: an individual might not be the subject-of-a-life yet still possess intrinsic value.Rowlands 1998, p. 61. The argument is a deontological one, as opposed to consequentialist. If an individual possesses a moral right, that right may not be sacrificed even if the consequences of doing so are appealing.Francione 1996, p. 14. He describes his \\"subject-of-a-life criterion\\" as follows: > [It] involves more than merely being alive and more than merely being > conscious. ... individuals are subjects-of-a-life if they have beliefs and > desires; perception, memory, and a sense of the future, including their own > future; an emotional life together with feelings of pleasure and pain; > preference- and welfare-interests; the ability to initiate action in pursuit > of their desires and goals; a psychophysical identity over time; and an > individual welfare in the sense that their experiential life fares well or > ill for them, logically independently of their utility for others and > logically independently of their being the object of anyone else's > interests. Those who satisfy the subject-of-a-life criterion themselves have > a distinctive kind of value ‚Äì inherent value ‚Äì and are not to be viewed or > treated as mere receptacles.\\"Regan 1983, p. 243. Regan argues that normally mental mammals over a year old satisfy the conditions, including most human beings, with the possible exception of those in persistent vegetative states, as do several species of birds, and possibly fish. The key attribute is that ‚Äì following Thomas Nagel's \\"What Is it Like to Be a Bat?\\" (1974) ‚Äì there is something that it is like to be those individuals; they are the subjects of experience whose lives matter to them, even if they do not matter to anyone else.Regan 1989 . In addition, Regan rejects the idea of contractarianism, as he makes the argument that children are \\"unable to sign contracts and lack rights\\". Similarly, animals do not have the capacity to sign contracts, so why should children have an advantage over animals? Furthermore, he makes the argument that if he were to approach animal rights through a contractarianism, when somebody kicks your dog, it is morally wrong because it upsets you but not the dog. Intuitively, this does not make sense, and contractarianism can be dismissed. His argument against utilitarianism is a bit more complicated.Regan, Tom. \\"Animal Rights.\\" Doing Ethics: Moral Reasoning and Contemporary Issues. By Lewis Vaughn. Second ed. New York: W. W. Norton, 2010. 575-82. Print. > [Tom's] Aunt Bea is old, inactive, a cranky, sour person, though not > physically ill. She prefers to go on living. She is also rather rich.

Most people, he assumes, would say no. Reviews The moral philosopher Mary Midgley notes in the London Review of Books that Regan builds on the work of Peter Singer, commenting that \\"utilitarianism [Singer's position], though strong today, is only one side of our current morality\\". Midgley states, \\"Essentially I think he [Regan] is right ... Persuasion is needed, not in the sense of illicit emotional pressure, but of imaginative restatement. From this angle, the strategy of Regan‚Äôs book is faulty. It is too abstract and too contentious. As tends to happen with American academic books in the Rawlsian tradition, the relation between theory and practice is oversimplified. There is too much attention paid to the winning of arguments and too little to the complexities of the world.\\" Midgley also notes, \\"Ought it [the Kantian idea of morality] really to be used ‚Äì as it still very often is ‚Äì to exclude animals from serious consideration? This is Regan‚Äôs question and he deals with it soundly. He does not find it hard to show that the notion of humanity which this Kantian view encapsulates is far too narrow, hard to defend at any time, and increasingly so today.\\", and \\"The core of Regan‚Äôs argument is, then, this concept of an independent, conscious being. Reversing the traditional approach, he puts the burden of proof on those who claim that some such beings do not matter\\" With regard to future debate, Midgley states: > It would certainly be better to relate ‚Äòrights‚Äô more clearly to a background > of other moral concepts, with much more attention to the priority systems by > which we deal with conflicts. And ‚Äì to consider the future ‚Äì we urgently > need now to move the controversy in the direction of asking what we mean by > rights and by equality, rather than continuing with any more simple yes-or- > no battles about whether animals have them. Regan‚Äôs book is certainly > important and in many ways admirable ‚Äì a serious, substantial contribution > to giving animals their proper place on the philosophical map.

By 2020, BYD converted some of its equipment to produce 5 million N95 masks per day to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Legal disputes On April 27, 2020 BYD hired attorney Charles Harder and filed a federal civil complaint in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, against VICE Media alleging defamation for a story that was published on April 11, 2020. BYD was unsuccessfully sued by Sony and Sanyo for patent infringement. The Taiwanese OEM Foxconn has also brought a suit against the company for the same reason. In addition to patent litigation, Foxconn has sued BYD in Hong Kong and Illinois court in 2007, alleging that BYD poached 50 Foxconn employees and was complicit in the stealing of trade secrets, in order to set up a competing cell phone manufacturing operation. Court proceedings were brought before BYD Electronic was spun off by BYD later in 2007, delaying the public listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange by half a year. Foxconn also opened proceedings in the district where BYD is headquartered, at the Shenzhen Intermediate People‚Äôs Court, which referred the case to the Supreme People‚Äôs Court, which in turn commissioned an appraisal by the Beijing JZSC Intellectual Property Forensic Center into files in BYD's possession which were alleged to belong to Foxconn. Eventually the Shenzhen court made the final judgment: BYD's files contained non-public information originating from Foxconn, which could bring economic benefits to the holders, thereby, BYD was found guilty of infringing Foxconn‚Äôs trade secrets. Afterwards, Foxconn withdrew the civil proceedings against BYD in mainland China, and sought criminal prosecution instead. On March 20th 2008, the former Executive Director and Vice President of BYD was arrested. Then on March 24th and 31st 2008 two former employees of Foxconn were arrested and sentenced to 1 year and 4 months, and 4 years in prison respectively. BYD issued a counterclaim to Foxconn in Hong Kong court, alleging defamation and bribery of Chinese officials as well as intimidation on Foxconn's part.

The Wheeler Compromise, sometimes known as the Wheeler Adjustment, was the settlement of the disputed gubernatorial election of 1872 in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and negotiation to organize the state's legislature in January 1875. It was negotiated by, and named after, William A. Wheeler, Congressman from New York and a member of the U.S. House Committee on Southern Affairs. He later was elected as Vice President of the United States. The political disruption and continued violence in Louisiana was thought to show the unraveling of Reconstruction; Wheeler said it was the failure of trying to \\"promote peace with the sword.\\" Republicans began to consider how to consolidate their strength in the North. Politics and state legislature The political situation in Louisiana in 1872 was increasingly volatile and elections in the state were surrounded by violence. Democrats nearly all white, struggled to suppress Republicans, nearly all black, from gathering or voting. After the disputed gubernatorial election of 1872, both Democrats and Republicans held inaugurations and appointed local officials. Eventually the federal government certified the election of the Republican candidate, William Pitt Kellogg as governor. =White militia= In 1873, white militia in Grant Parish turned out Republican parish officeholders and killed 80-100 black defenders which became known as the Colfax Massacre. By 1874, Confederate veterans of that action had formed the White League, a paramilitary group that formed chapters across the state. In the smaller Coushatta Massacre, several white Republicans were killed, as were 15-20 black witnesses. In September 1874, in the Battle of Liberty Place, 5,000 members of the White League fought against about 3500 Metropolitan Police in an attempt to seize state buildings (which they occupied for three day) while attempting to throw out elected Republicans and seat John McEnery (D) as governor. More than 56 people were killed, mostly among the city's police and militia defenders.Adolph Reed, Jr., \\"The battle of Liberty Monument - New Orleans, Louisiana white supremacist statue\\", The Progressive, June 1993, accessed 18 May 2010 The White League retreated when federal troops entered the city and Kellogg was restored to office. =Federal troops= Governor Kellogg then asked for federal aid to prevent violence when the state legislature met for the first time on January 4, 1875 to organize the following elections. The entrance to the State House in New Orleans was monitored. General Philippe R√©gis de Trobriand, commanding the Thirteenth U.S. Infantry, had stationed forces around the building the night before. The Returning Board had certified 54 Republicans and 52 Democrats as elected to the state legislature, with some five contested seats: for Bienville, De Soto, Grant and Winn parishes, to be settled by the legislature. When the members assembled, both parties had elected Speakers of the House, and the Democrats attempted to take over the legislature en masse, by having their elected Speaker, Louis A. Wiltz, former mayor of New Orleans, take the chair immediately when they entered the chamber. They later withdrew to caucus. Through Governor Kellogg, Republican House officials requested aid to clear the house of non-certified members. Each of the Democrats made a speech before leaving, and they withdrew as a group, moving out to a place in the city to address their supporters. Many people in the North criticized the use of federal forces in relation to the state legislature. On the same day, the Democrats boycotted organizing the State Senate, while the 29 elected Republicans attempted to organize it alone. That night President Ulysses S. Grant ordered General Philip Sheridan to take control of the Gulf Department.\\"Louisiana, Exciting Scenes at the Opening of the Legislature...or \\", New York Times, 5 January 1875, accessed 30 January 2014 Wheeler compromise William A. Wheeler As the situation in Louisiana worsened, Congressman William A. Wheeler of New York and other members of the House Committee on Southern Affairs went to New Orleans to investigate. They had already looked at some of the issues related to the elections of Kellogg and McEnery. They also heard testimony from both political parties as part of the work to support Reconstruction. The Democrats objected to federal troops having been used in the State House, and the Republicans to the actions by the Democrats. Governor Kellogg was permitted to remain in power, while the House Committee arbitrated the seats disputed by the Returning Board. Most of these seats were awarded to the Democrats.Vice Presidents of the United States - William A. Wheeler, U.S. Senate website, retrieved May 16, 2008 In March 1875, the U.S. House of Representatives endorsed what became known as the Wheeler Compromise, although it appeared to concede that Reconstruction was unraveling in the state.

The Democrats and Republicans met separately, effectively running distinct governments in the state. In 1876 they had another disputed gubernatorial election. President Grant refused to recognize the Republicans in Louisiana and South Carolina, both states marked by excessive election violence. The national Democratic Party agreed to a compromise to gain election of President Rutherford Hayes, and in early January 1877, Grant ordered the withdrawal of federal troops from New Orleans. Later that year, they were withdrawn from the rest of the state and others, and Reconstruction ended across the South. References Further reading * Andrews, Elisha B.

Plot summary Tom Llewyllyn and Somerset Lloyd-James (the latter by mistake) have been engaged to write the script of a movie version of the Odyssey, to be shot on Corfu. After some wrangling they ask Fielding Gray to help, since he is a man with knowledge of Greek and the classics in general. The shooting has many comic turns since the movie team wants to do a sexy story while the foundation supplying the money demands something more radical that will substantially alter the story. Left-wing actress Sasha Grimes, who is to be the foundation's \\"watcher\\" during the shoot, suggests, for example, that Odysseus give away his land to the poor. Gray works hard to keep the original story and even starts a sexual relationship with Grimes to be able to control her better. Max de Freville and his friend Lyki are also engaged in the movie and make visits during the shooting. They also bring Angela Tuck, suffering from terrible obesity in later years. When Angela, in a deal with Fielding, watches him having sex with Sasha, she has a heart attack and dies. Fielding, thinking about old age, is trying to blackmail producer Foxy Galahead for ¬£50,000 to continue to keep Sasha Grimes under control. Galahead, Max, Lyki and director Jules frame Fielding and he is arrested by Earle Restarick during a trip to Zurich. Restarick and his thugs keeps Fielding prisoner in Athens and since the film team told them another story Restarick believes that Gray once again is digging in the things told in The Judas Boy. Restarick threatens to turn Fielding into a junkie to make him confess. Galahead throws a Christmas party for a number of guests, among them Lord Canteloupe, Somerset Lloyd-James and Captain Detterling. When Galahead brags to actress Elena about how he framed Fielding, she tells the three Englishmen at the party, and they decide to rescue Fielding. Canteloupe, infuriated by the thought that an Englishman be kept prisoner in a country of no importance (like Greece), bursts into the villa where Fielding is (officially) being nursed after a \\"mental breakdown\\" and takes him home to England. When Fielding arrives home Harriet is not there. At peace, he begins on a number of new commissions given him by Gregory Stern.

The species is endemic to Australia. One of Australia's least habitat-specific geckos, it occurs naturally across much of the country, and has also established in areas where it does not occur naturally, such as urban Perth, Western Australia. It is dark brown to reddish brown, depending on the colour of the ground upon which it lives. There are irregular light bands with dark edges along its back. It is one of a small number of vertebrate species that are known to reproduce by parthenogenesis. Etymology The specific name, binoei, is in honour of British naturalist Benjamin Bynoe (1804-1865), who was a naval surgeon aboard HMS Beagle with Charles Darwin.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Heteronotia binoei, p. 45). Description The Bynoe's gecko is a slender, long-tailed species which may grow to a total length (including tail) of . It is covered with small scales which appear to be rough, but are soft to touch. It has slim toes which end with strong claws, but unlike many other gecko species, it does not have expandable toe pads. It has a large head and large eyes, lacking eyelids but being covered with transparent scales.Bynoe's gecko videos, photos and facts ‚Äì Heteronotia binoei . ARKive. Retrieved on 2013-10-26. To keep its eyes clean, it wipes dirt and dust from the lenses with its tongue. The body is covered with small spine like ridges which run down the length of the back, referred to in the alternative common name \\"prickly gecko\\". Colours include yellow, cream, beige, black, and white, with most carrying at least two of these colours. Stripes, speckles, spots, or blotches may cover the gecko.Bynoe's Gecko . Pilbarapythons.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-26. It usually has an indication of a dark temporal streak and another dark streak along the canthus rostralis. The lips are whitish and usually lightly fleckled with a darkish brown.Cogger, Harold (1996). Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia. Sixth Revised edition. Melbourne: Reed Books Australia. 788 pp. . (Heteronotia binoei, p. 247). Like many species of geckos, a wide array of calls can be made with its well-developed vocal chords. Geographic range The Bynoe's gecko is found in all mainland Australia's states, except the Australian Capital Territory. It is endemic to Australia, but is not found in humid parts of the southeast and southwest. It also inhabits many islands off the west coast and has large populations on Barrow Island.Moro, Dorian; MacAulay, Isobel (2010). A Guide to the Reptiles and Amphibians of Barrow Island . Perth: Chevron Australia Pty. Ltd. 72 pp. . Habitat The Bynoe's gecko occurs in many habitats throughout Australia. It is most commonly found in woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed habitats, all being open and dry. It can also be found in tropical rainforests, central deserts, and coastal sand dunes. As it is a terrestrial species, it takes shelter under all types of ground cover including leaves, logs, stumps, stones, termite mounds, loose bark at the base of trees, and animal burrows. It has been found to shelter under man made habitat. Furthermore, the Bynoe's gecko is often the most abundant reptile found in many arid areas in Australia.Wilson, Steve; Swan, Gerry (2006). A Complete Guide to Reptiles of Australia, Second Edition. Sydney: New Holland Publishers. 512 pp. . Reproduction In Australia, the Bynoe's gecko has been found to be in ideal breeding condition between July and September. Sexual maturity is reached in 1 to 3 years and females lay 2 eggs over the months of September to January. Eggs are soft-shelled when laid, but become hardened and brittle when exposed to the air. These eggs are usually deposited under rocks, inside animal burrows, or inside logs. Each female only produces 1 clutch per year. Females on Barrow Island reproduce by parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction where the growth and development of the embryo occurs without fertilisation by a male. Diet The Bynoe's gecko is mainly active at night. It leaves its shelter and hunts various invertebrates including moths and grasshoppers throughout the night. It hunts among leaf litter or in bare open spaces and will occasionally climb trees or within rocks to source food. Predators and threats Like many other geckos, the Bynoe's gecko has many predators. It is able to flee rapidly and quickly when disturbed but is likely to still be vulnerable to attack by a range of other predators including larger lizards.

The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 2004 and was theatrically released on 15 October 2004. The digital puppetry and CGI animation for Psammead was created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Five Children and It grossed ¬£1,519,049 worldwide. The film was released on DVD on 5 July 2005. Plot The film begins with five children (Robert, Cyril, Jane, Anthea and The Lamb), whose father has gone to fight in World War I. Consequently, the children must meanwhile stay at their aunt and eccentric uncle's house with his unpleasant son, Horace. While exploring the house, Robert finds a locked door in the forbidden greenhouse and brings the other children. They manage to open the door, which leads them through a secret path to the beach surrounding the house. There they discover a large shelled creature, which reveals itself as a \\"psammead crustacean decapodlium wishasaurus,\\" or sand fairy for short. The children, befuddled by this confusing name, refer to the creature simply as \\"It.\\" It seems rather mischievous and Cyril doubts whether the children should trust him, but upon confirming that It can grant wishes, the children wish for all the house chores on their list to be done by magic. When they return to the house, they see dozens of copies of themselves doing the chores and wrecking the house in the attempt. Suddenly, everything disappears in clouds of golden dust. They are then forced to tidy up the mess themselves. When they return to It and ask why their clones disappeared, It explains that at sunset, all wishes fade away. The children blame It for the mess, but It responds by saying that wishes bring valuable lessons. The children need money to fix all the broken items, so they wish for buckets of gold and go off into town to buy some items. The children aren't able to buy anything because the owners will not accept gold, believing it is fake. They manage to purchase a car, having nothing else to do with the gold, and end up crashing it during a test drive. Mr. Peasemarsh, the owner, becomes furious and causes a scene with the children as the authorities and their aunt both appear on the scene. When Mr. Peasemarsh tries to reveal the children's \\"stolen gold\\", it vanishes just before he can show it to the officers, who take him away, believing he is out of his mind. Horace, meanwhile, is becoming suspicious of the children, and when they refuse to tell him what secret they're hiding, he manages to catch them in a room and locks it, telling them he won't let them out until they come clean. Robert, who was not with the rest when Horace trapped them, goes to It and wishes for wings so they can go off to France and find their father. The other children fly out the window when they discover their new wings, and Horace eventually decides to let them out only to discover them missing and the window open. While flying, the children are almost killed by heavy aircraft, but they just barely manage to escape danger. With sunset drawing near, they have no choice but to go home. During their return trip, their wings begin to fade, and it appears they will fall into the sea, but It's face appears among the clouds and blows on the children, sweeping them through the air back to shore. When the children's mother returns, the children learn that their father has gone missing. Robert talks to It that night, and falls asleep next to It on the beach. Horace, having followed Robert, captures It and brings him to his basement. The next morning, Robert confronts Horace but is unwilling to act, as Horace has his father's compass. Seeing that Horace plans to dissect It to find out how he works his magic, Robert suggests Horace wish for something instead. Interested in the idea, Horace wishes for his fossilized dinosaur egg to hatch. The children arrive in time to see Horace's dinosaur standing high above them and threatening to eat them. After trying to calm it down, It makes the dinosaur vanish. Shocked, Horace passes out, and Robert takes him to their mother, while the other children wish for their father to come home. He appears on the beach and talks to the children, but only minutes later he vanishes as sunset hits the beach. Robert, having just nearly missed returning to see him, is devastated. The children go to Horace, and they talk about what happened in the basement. Horace, surprised at the secret, becomes agreeable, and the children settle their differences, and agree to share the secret of Its existence together. On It's birthday, the children wish It a good future and prepare to return home. When their car breaks down, they are forced to stay in the house and Horace suggests a game of hide-and-seek. As Robert counts, his father appears. When Robert realizes that its really their father, he and the children are overjoyed, joined by their mother. Finally reunited with their father, the children prepare to go home. In a post credits scene, It contemplates a sequel \\"It and Five Children\\".

Released theatrically on August 11, 1958, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. Plot Woody Woodpecker's in bed reading a paper's ‚ÄúBusiness Opportunity‚Äù section. His eyes light up as he reads an ad: ‚ÄúTourists!! Visit the Everglades and make big money in alligator bags.‚Äù Strolling through the ‚ÄúEverglade Estates,‚Äù Woody passes by an office in a large tree, whose sole occupant is a large, half-starved alligator. Business is really bad, and the alligator's only thought is of food. Seeing Woody pass by his office door, the alligator envisions a roasted woodpecker and makes plans to trap. Woody comes to a sign- ‚ÄúWalk In‚Äù- and in he walks, right into the alligator's mouth. It being somewhat damp inside the alligator, Woody lights a fire, which causes the alligator to choke and cough Woody right out into the open again. Woody then sees the alligator for the first time, and in his mind's eye, he sees the number of alligator bags that he could produce. A battle of wits ensues between Woody and the alligator so that he can begin making bags; the alligator wants a good square meal. Various and sundry methods are used by both to accomplish their purpose, but in the end, both Woody and the alligator are frustrated in their efforts, as neither can attain his desired aim.

It was built around 1868 by a local pharmacist. The Knuessl Building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History The Knuessl Building was built for Maxmillion Knuessl, a German-born Ottawan who came to the city in 1855. Knuessl was a trained druggist. The building served as his drugstore until his children later moved it in 1895, a few years after their father's death. The Knuessl Brothers Drug Store was in business into the 1940s. The structure has had many other uses through the years, including housing other businesses, churches, and storage.Collins, James Edward. \\"Knuessl Building\\", (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, January 23, 1992, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, accessed May 16, 2008. Architecture The Knuessl Building is wide by long and stands tall. It is the most prominent structure in a block of commercial buildings along West Main Street in Ottawa. The front elevation is divided by a center staircase leading to the upper floors and creating two storefronts. In 1912 the building underwent some alterations which moved the storefront entrances from centered, to either side, creating a single, large display area for each storefront. The Knuessl Building is an example of the transition from wood-framed building construction to masonry construction in the 1860s. The building represents a mid-19th century commercial building design meant to evoke the Italian Renaissance known as Italianate. Historic significance The Knuessl Building and the building adjacent it are the only two in the commercial block that retain much of their front facade details and ornamentation, especially their cornices, arched windows and storefronts. The Knuessl is one of the most intact mid-19th century buildings in Ottawa. It is a locally significant example of a mid-19th century commercial design, Italianate, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 1992.

Heading and arming Resistance groups, he played an important role in the liberation in the Bordeaux region, and ended the war in Force 136. Biography Roger was born in Paris the second son (of three) to Barnet Landes, of Polish-Jewish descent, and a Russian mother - Barnet's grandfather had fled Russian Poland to avoid the pogroms and Imperial conscription, setting up a jewellery business in Hatton Garden before settling in Paris. Barnet's children had then fought for Britain in the First World War. Barnet spoke poor English and so preferred to live in Paris and run a jewellery business there. It was in Paris that Roger was born and educated, and he remained there with one of his two brothers when his parents' jewellery business collapsed in the Great Depression and they moved to London. Roger graduated in architecture at the √âcole des Beaux Arts before also moving to London after the Munich Crisis, where he joined London County Council as a quantity surveyor. Roger was conscripted into the Royal Corps of Signals in March 1941 and, speaking better French than English and already knowing Morse code, he was soon recruited into SOE (F section) at the request of Lewis Gielgud and Maurice Buckmaster. His first mission, with his codename as Aristide, was as radio operator to the SCIENTIST network under Claude de Baissac (David). He was parachuted into France with Gilbert Norman on the night of 31 October 1942. After de Baissac's return to England on 16/17 August, Landes succeeded him as the network's head. Recalled to London, he left on the night of 1 November 1943, crossing the Pyr√©n√©es, being held for a time in Spain and finally reaching Gibraltar and then England, landing on 15 January 1944 by plane near Swindon. His second mission began on 1/2 March 1944 with an aborted attempt to parachute him back into France, in Gascony this time, postponed to the night of 2/3 March 1944. The second attempt was successful, and he was accompanied by Allyre Sirois. As the head of the ACTOR network, he rebuilt it from the remains of the SCIENTIST network and equipped and headed several Resistance groups up until the liberation of Bordeaux. On the city's liberation on 17 September 1944, he was presented to G√©n√©ral de Gaulle, who said to him \\"You're English? Your place is not here\\" and asked him to leave the country within 2 days. Roger Landes left Bordeaux, but stayed for a time in Paris, returning to England on 10 October, where he was looked after. In 1945, he volunteered to join Force 136 in the Far East. In March he was sent to Colombo, and in May he and 15 commandos were parachuted into the Malayan jungle near the Thailand frontier. His actions as part of this special unit brought him a bar on his Military Cross.  Recognition * UK : Military Cross for his first period in France (bar later awarded for his second period in France) * France : Knight (1950) then officer (1992) of the L√©gion d'honneur, Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 (1945) In August 1950, he was invited to Bordeaux by Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who awarded him his L√©gion d'honneur in a ceremony reuniting the townsfolk and old Resistance workers. Marriage and issue His first wife was Ginette Corbin, daughter of Charles Corbin (a French agent of the Scientist network, to whom Andr√© Grandcl√©ment revealed that he intended to betray the arms caches to the Gestapo), and they had one son. She died in 1983 (obituary - Times, 12 March 1983), and Landes married Margaret Laing in 1990, who survived him.  Sources  * Michael Richard Daniell Foot, SOE in France.

This assignment can be uniquely extended to an assignment of truth values to all propositional formulas. In first-order logic, a language consists of a collection of constant symbols, a collection of function symbols, and a collection of relation symbols. Formulas are built out of atomic formulas using logical connectives and quantifiers. A structure consists of a set (domain of discourse) that determines the range of the quantifiers, along with interpretations of the constant, function, and relation symbols in the language. Corresponding to each structure is a unique truth assignment for all sentences (formulas with no free variables) in the language.  Notation  If v is a valuation, that is, a mapping from the atoms to the set \\\\\\\\{ t, f \\\\\\\\}, then the double-bracket notation is commonly used to denote a valuation; that is, v(\\\\phi)=[\\\\\\\\![\\\\phi]\\\\\\\\!]_v for a proposition \\\\phi.Dirk van Dalen, (2004) Logic and Structure, Springer Universitext, (see section 1.2)  See also  * Algebraic semantics  References  *, chapter 6 Algebra of formalized languages. * Category:Semantic units Category:Model theory Category:Interpretation (philosophy) ","title":"Valuation (logic)"},{"id":"17456975","text":"A blondie (also known as a blonde brownie) is a rich, sweet dessert bar. It resembles the traditional chocolate brownie, but substitutes vanilla for the cocoa used in brownies, and contains brown sugar. Blondies are made from flour, brown sugar, butter, eggs, baking powder, and vanilla, and may also contain walnuts or pecans. Blondies often contain white or dark chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, or other flavored chips. Blondies differ significantly from white chocolate brownies. Unlike the white chocolate brownie or the normal brownie, they contain no chocolate or chocolate flavouring, other than chocolate chips, which may be included. They may also contain coconut, nuts, toffee, or any other chunky candy for added texture. Blondies are not usually frosted; the brown sugar tends to be sweet enough. A variation is the Congo bar, which contains chocolate chips with either walnuts or coconut. They are baked in a pan in an oven in a manner similar to that of the baking of traditional brownies, then they are cut into rectangular shapes for serving. Blondies are sometimes served in sundaes, often topped with caramel sauce. History Blondies existed for at least ten years before chocolate brownies; \\"dense, fudgy, butterscotch-flavoured bar[s]\\" existed in the late 19th century, and chocolate brownies were not developed until 1905.

It is a concept closely related to that of a measure, and as such, it finds applications in measure theory, probability theory, and theoretical computer science.  Domain/Measure theory definition  Let \\\\scriptstyle (X,\\\\mathcal{T}) be a topological space: a valuation is any map : v:\\\\mathcal{T} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^+\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{+\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} satisfying the following three properties : \\\\begin{array}{lll} v(\\\\varnothing) = 0 & & \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\text{Strictness property}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ v(U)\\\\leq v(V) & \\\\mbox{if}~U\\\\subseteq V\\\\quad U,V\\\\in\\\\mathcal{T} & \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\text{Monotonicity property}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ v(U\\\\cup V)+ v(U\\\\cap V) = v(U)+v(V) & \\\\forall U,V\\\\in\\\\mathcal{T} & \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\text{Modularity property}}\\\\, \\\\end{array} The definition immediately shows the relationship between a valuation and a measure: the properties of the two mathematical object are often very similar if not identical, the only difference being that the domain of a measure is the Borel algebra of the given topological space, while the domain of a valuation is the class of open sets. Further details and references can be found in and . = Continuous valuation = A valuation (as defined in domain theory/measure theory) is said to be continuous if for every directed family \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{U_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\in I} of open sets (i.e. an indexed family of open sets which is also directed in the sense that for each pair of indexes i and j belonging to the index set I , there exists an index k such that \\\\scriptstyle U_i\\\\subseteq U_k and \\\\scriptstyle U_j\\\\subseteq U_k) the following equality holds: : v\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{i\\\\in I}U_i\\\\right) = \\\\sup_{i\\\\in I} v(U_i). This property is analogous to the œÑ-additivity of measures. = Simple valuation = A valuation (as defined in domain theory/measure theory) is said to be simple if it is a finite linear combination with non-negative coefficients of Dirac valuations, i.e. :v(U)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\\\delta_{x_i}(U)\\\\quad\\\\forall U\\\\in\\\\mathcal{T} where a_i is always greater than or at least equal to zero for all index i. Simple valuations are obviously continuous in the above sense. The supremum of a directed family of simple valuations (i.e. an indexed family of simple valuations which is also directed in the sense that for each pair of indexes i and j belonging to the index set I , there exists an index k such that \\\\scriptstyle v_i(U)\\\\leq v_k(U)\\\\\\\\! and \\\\scriptstyle v_j(U)\\\\leq v_k(U)\\\\\\\\!) is called quasi-simple valuation :\\\\bar{v}(U) = \\\\sup_{i\\\\in I}v_i(U) \\\\quad \\\\forall U\\\\in \\\\mathcal{T}. \\\\, = See also = * The extension problem for a given valuation (in the sense of domain theory/measure theory) consists in finding under what type of conditions it can be extended to a measure on a proper topological space, which may or may not be the same space where it is defined: the papers and in the reference section are devoted to this aim and give also several historical details. * The concepts of valuation on convex sets and valuation on manifolds are a generalization of valuation in the sense of domain/measure theory. A valuation on convex sets is allowed to assume complex values, and the underlying topological space is the set of non-empty convex compact subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space: a valuation on manifolds is a complex valued finitely additive measure defined on a proper subset of the class of all compact submanifolds of the given manifolds.  Examples  = Dirac valuation = Let \\\\scriptstyle (X,\\\\mathcal{T}) be a topological space, and let x be a point of X: the map :\\\\delta_x(U)= \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\mbox{if}~x otin U\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\mbox{if}~x\\\\in U \\\\end{cases} \\\\quad\\\\forall U\\\\in\\\\mathcal{T} is a valuation in the domain theory/measure theory, sense called Dirac valuation.

Wartime experience in occupied France In 1941 Sirois responded to the call to aid Great Britain in World War II by enrolling in the Canadian Army. Years later, he recalled that he thought it was his duty to do something against Nazism.Beverly Fast, \\"My Life as a Spy\\", Green & White ‚Äì University of Saskatchewan Alumni Magazine, Fall 2005, p. 12. He was initially assigned to the Signal Corps. In 1943 he was loaned to the War Office (MI5) for espionage duty in Occupied France, primarily owing to his fluency in French. Assigned as an agent in Special Operations Executive's F section, in the spring of 1944 Sirois was sent to Toulouse in occupied France as a radio operator under the codename Gustave.

Warned by the girlfriend of one of the arrested members of his unit, Sirois radioed to London that they had a traitor. He later recalled: \\"They said do what you have to do. In occupied territory, that's the law of the gun. I had him done away with.\\" On another occasion, Sirois and another member of the Resistance narrowly escaped being caught at night by a German patrol. Hiding behind a hedgerow, they heard the patrol open fire with machine guns, but in the darkness their aim was off. Sirois and the other agent were unharmed. His time in France came to an end in August 1944 when southern France was liberated. He managed to make it to Paris for the liberation celebrations, before returning to Saskatchewan shortly before Christmas 1944.

The \\"Van Eps Recording Banjo\\" was a well-known model until 1930. He was the father of jazz guitarist George Van Eps. Biography Van Eps was born in Somerville, New Jersey, United States, and moved with his family to Plainfield in 1892. He learned to play the banjo and studied the phonograph cylinder recordings of Vess Ossman. In 1897 Van Eps was hired by Thomas Edison's National Phonograph Company in West Orange to work in studio engagements. Van Eps's cylinder recordings, often remakes of Ossman's tunes, sold well for Edison. Early ragtime banjo recordings by Van Eps included \\"A Bunch of Rags\\" (1900) and \\"A Ragtime Episode\\" (1902).\\"The First Ragtime Records (1897-1903),\\" The Red Hot Jazz Archive. Accessed May 24, 2008. He also recorded for a number of other companies, including Columbia (from 1904) and Victor (from 1910). The Van Eps Trio recorded steadily from 1912 to 1922. He also led other groups, such as the Van Eps Quartet, the Van Eps Specialty Four, and the Van Eps Banjo Orchestra. In 1914, the latter group was one of the first to record for the American branch of the French Path√© Fr√®res Company. In 1921, Orlando Kellum, inventor of the Photokinema sound-on-disc sound film system, filmed the Van Eps Trio in The Famous Van Eps Trio in a Bit of Jazz. With Henry Burr, he formed a company that manufactured and sold the Van Eps Recording Banjo, modeled on the one he used in recordings and concerts. The banjo remained on the market until about 1930, when widespread use of electric recording removed the need for the loud volume produced by the Van Eps model. By the 1930s the banjo had fallen out of favor in popular music, and Van Eps switched to guitar, playing as a studio musician with Benny Goodman, Ray Noble, and Red Norvo. He was associated with the British banjo composer Frank Lawes and recorded some pieces with him. In the 1950s he attempted a comeback with a number of banjo recordings before his death in Burbank, California, at the age of 81. Van Eps also worked in vaudeville and influenced pre-bluegrass musicians like Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers.

History Joy was created as a reaction to the 1929 Wall Street crash, which had diminished the fortunes of Jean Patou's wealthy American clientele. Despite its elevated price and the depressed economic environment, Joy became a success and has remained Jean Patou's most famous fragrance. Patou was acquired by Procter & Gamble in 2001. In 2002, Patou launched Enjoy, a contemporary take on Joy meant for younger women. In 2011 Patou was bought by Designer Parfums Ltd, a UK-based firm. In August 2018, LVMH purchased Patou and Dior, an LVMH brand, acquired the rights to the name \\"Joy\\". In August 2018, Dior launched a perfume named Joy. Composition Joy is composed primarily of a combination of jasmine and rose; 10,000 jasmine flowers and 28 dozen roses are required to create 30ml of the parfum, contributing to its high retail price. Joy also contains other flowers such as ylang ylang, michelia and tuberose. Given its many ingredients, Joy does not smell like a specific flower. According to Luca Turin, \\"the whole point of its formula was to achieve the platonic idea of a flower, not one particular earthly manifestation.\\" The original bottle, designed by French architect and artisan Louis S√ºe, was designed to have a simple, classical feel. Awards \\"Joy\\" was voted \\"Scent of the Century\\" by the public at the Fragrance Foundation FiFi Awards in 2000, beating its rival \\"Chanel No. 5\\". Joy is preserved in its original 1930 formulation in the archives of the Osmoth√®que, donated to the collection by Jean Kerl√©o, formerly head perfumer at Jean Patou.Osmoth√®que - Conservatoire international des parfums.

Early life and career Flaithr√≠ √ì Maolchonaire was born in the townland of Figh, civil parish of Tibohine, barony of Frenchpark, County Roscommon.Benjamin Hazard, Faith & Patronage: the political career of Flaithr√≠ √ì Maolchonaire, c.1560-1620 (Dublin 2009, repr. 2010), p. 11. His father and mother were F√≠thil and On√≥ra √ì Maolchonaire. Two other sons survived to adulthood, Maoilechlainn and Firbisigh. They belonged to a well- known family of historians and poets whose principal estate was at Cluain Ploc√°in (Ballymulconry), civil parish of Kiltrustan, County Roscommon. Flaithr√≠ was brought up in the family profession. He studied for the priesthood at Salamanca, entering the Irish college founded in 1592. √ì Maolchonaire first studied the liberal arts and philosophy. On 10 December 1594, he was in the third year of his studies at Salamanca. A year earlier he had translated into Irish a short Castilian catechism by Jer√≥nimo de Ripalda SJ. The original is a simple catechetical work written in Aristotelian master- pupil dialogue. According to M√≠che√°l Mac Craith, √ì Maolchonaire's translation pointedly referred to the Irish as Eirinnach rather than Gaedheal.M√≠che√°l Mac Craith, 'Conry, Florence (√ì Maoil Chonaire, Flaithr√≠; √ì Maolchonaire; Conrius, Florentius),' in: Dictionary of Irish Biography (Cambridge 2009). After five years at the Salamanca Irish college, √ì Maolchonaire left to join the Franciscan province of Santiago. Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil was among his classmates in the Salamanca Franciscan friary. They and nine of their peers in the Santiago province were later raised to the episcopacy, an unprecedented development in the history of the order. In a memorial of 1606, Francisco Arias D√°vila y Bobadilla, conde de Pu√±onrostro, stated that √ì Maolchonaire was ordained after taking the habit of the friars minor.Hazard, Faith & Patronage, pp 32-33. Activities during and after the Nine Years' War At the height of the Nine Years' War, Flaithr√≠ √ì Maolchonaire sailed to Ireland where he served as a confessor and preacher to troops under the command of Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell. In 1601, they requested a bishopric for √ì Maolchonaire 'in recognition of his diligence, commending his sound judgment on Irish affairs.'Hazard, Faith & Patronage, p. 37. After the disaster of Kinsale in 1601, √ì Maolchonaire accompanied O'Donnell to Spain as his confessor and adviser, hoping to see a renewal of Spanish military intervention in Ireland. In 1602, √ì Maolchonaire attempted to get approval for O'Donnell to meet Philip III in person but they were kept at arm's length by the Spanish court. During this time, they also drafted an official complaint against the Jesuit superiors of the Irish college at Salamanca over presumed discrimination in favour of Old English students at the expense of students from Connacht and Ulster. Despondent at having to wait so long for a response to his repeated calls for military support in Ireland, O'Donnell became seriously ill. He died at Simancas, being assisted on his deathbed by √ì MaolconaireFour Masters, ad an. 1602 Writing to Rome, Ludovico Mansoni recorded the day of the earl‚Äôs death as 9 September, stating that O'Donnell died from a tapeworm after sixteen days of illness.Darren McGettigan, Red Hugh O'Donnell and the Nine Years War (Dublin 2005), p. 116. In keeping with his patronage of the order of friars minor in Donegal, Red Hugh O'Donnell was buried in the Franciscan habit. √ì Maolchonaire accompanied the remains to their last resting place in the Franciscan church at Valladolid. Aware that the patronage vital to military intervention and to the education of their followers came from the same sources, √ì Maolchonaire continued to press for action after the death of O'Donnell.Hazard, Faith & Patronage, p. 40. He participated in an abandoned maritime expedition which reached Achill Sound in 1603 but never landed in Ireland.Hazard, Faith & Patronage, p. 40. √ì Maolchonaire subsequently assisted the Spanish councils of state and war to stem the flow of Irish military migrants and their dependents in Spain.See Ciaran O‚ÄôScea, 'The role of Castilian royal bureaucracy in the formation of early-modern Irish literacy,' in: O‚ÄôConnor and Lyons (eds), Irish communities in early-modern Europe (Dublin 2006), pp 200‚Äì239. As adviser to Pu√±onrostro, the king‚Äôs appointee as protector of Irish exiles in Spain, √ì Maolchonaire helped to secure funds for widows, orphans and clerics. Trained as a chronicler and genealogist, he sponsored the entry of Irish soldiers into Spanish military orders and successfully called for the promotion of Henry O‚ÄôNeill, second eldest son of the earl of Tyrone, as colonel of Irish infantry units in Flanders, the O'Neill tercio in 1604.Hazard, Faith & Patronage, pp 43-50. The Foundation of the College of St Anthony of Padua In 1606, the Franciscan general chapter was held in Toledo where Flaithr√≠ √ì Maolchonaire was selected as minister-provincial of the Irish friars minor. His assimilation into Castilian life and the contacts he made were of considerable benefit to his confr√®res and successors. The most notable act of his tenure as provincial was the founding of a new Irish Franciscan college at Leuven in the Habsburg Netherlands. A year before his appointment, √ì Maolchonaire began his efforts in earnest with an appeal to the Spanish king. The loss of five Franciscan houses during the Nine Years' War made a new foundation essential. In response, Philip III instructed Archduke Albert to provide a perpetual grant for a new college in the university town of Leuven.Hazard, Faith & Patronage, pp 50-54. √ì Maolchonaire‚Äôs part in founding the college clearly influenced the Catholic pastoral mission to Ireland during the seventeenth century.Thomas O‚ÄôConnor, 'Florence Conry‚Äôs campaign for a Catholic Restoration in Ireland,' in: Seanchas Ard Mhacha, 19 (2002), pp 91-105 The first and most active Irish printing press on the continent was long in operation at Leuven. √ì Maolchonaire and the Flight of the Earls After Hugh O'Neill and Rory O'Donnell left Ireland in 1607, Flaithr√≠ √ì Maolconaire accompanied them from Douai to Rome as interpreter and advisor.Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le (eag.), Turas na dTaoiseach nUltach tar S√°ile: from R√°th Maol√°in to Rome. Tadhg √ì Cian√°in‚Äôs Contemporary Narrative of the Journey into Exile of the Ulster Chieftains and Their Followers, 1607‚Äì8 (Rome 2007), p. 86. Christopher St. Laurence, baron of Howth, implicated √ì Maolchonaire in a plot to seize Dublin Castle and raise a new rebellion just before the Flight of the Earls.Charles Meehan, The fate and fortunes of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and Rory O'Donel, Earl of Tyrconnell, their Flight from Ireland and Death in Exile (Dublin 1868), pp 67‚Äì73 In recognition of his losses, Philip III and Paul V offered O'Neill the concession of √ì Maolchonaire‚Äôs promotion to the archbishopric of Tuam. On Sunday 3 May 1609, √ì Maolchonaire was consecrated archbishop by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini in the centre of Rome at the Chiesa Santo Spirito in Sassia.Hazard, Faith & Patronage, p. 58. √ì Maolchonaire remained in Rome until his appointment as archbishop of Tuam before returning to Madrid on behalf of Hugh O'Neill. He communicated in 1610 to the Council of Spain, a translation of the original (Irish) statement of one Francis Maguire concerning his observations in the \\"State of Virginia\\", between 1608 and 1610, a curious and unique document of the earliest English settlements in the New World and the life and habits of the Indian tribes.Alexander Brown, The Genesis of the United States, Boston, 1890, I, 392-399 In response to the 1613‚Äì1615 Parliament of Ireland, √ì Maolchonaire wrote from Valladolid a remonstrance to the Catholic members of the parliament, rebuking them for assenting to the Bill of Attainder that confiscated the estates of O'Neill, O'Donnell and their adherents. As Archbishop of Tuam, √ì Maolconaire never took possession of his see, governing through vicars general. He continued to live in Madrid and Leuven, as was the case with many Irish clergy at the time. Like his fellow- Franciscan, Luke Wadding, and Peter Lombard, Archbishop of Armagh, √ì Maolchonaire served as a key intermediary and his influence in Irish matters was considerable. In 1626, a year after Charles I declared war on Spain, √ì Maolchonaire made the case for an invasion of Ireland under the joint leadership of the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell. Legacy Flaithr√≠ √ì Maolconaire died at the Franciscan friary of San Francisco el Grande in Madrid on 18 November 1629.Hazard, Faith & Patronage, p.153 In 1654, two Irish friars brought his remains back to the College of St Anthony of Padua in Leuven where he was buried in the collegiate chapel, near the high altar. An epitaph in stone by Nicolas Aylmer recorded his virtues, learning and love of country:-- :Ordinis altus honor, fidei patriaeque honos, Pontificum merito laude perenne jubar. The inscription on the grave-slab, by another author, describes √ì Maolchonaire as laboribus variis fidei et patriae...fractus (‚Äòworn out by various labours for faith and fatherland‚Äô).Mac Craith, in: Dictionary of Irish Biography (Cambridge 2009). √ì Maolconaire's best-known written work was printed at Leuven in 1616. Sg√°th√°n an Chr√°bhaidh (Mirror of Devotion) , is a translation into Irish of a popular allegorical tale, Spill de la Vida Religiosa. √ì Maolchonaire may have become familiar with the original text during his studies at Salamanca where the eleventh Castilian edition had been published in 1580. Se√°n √ì S√∫illeabh√°in states that √ì Maolchonaire also referred to a copy of the original Catalan for his Irish translation.Se√°n √ì S√∫illeabh√°in, ‚Äò√ödar Sg√°th√°n an Chr√°bhaidh,‚Äô in: Maynooth Review, 14 (1989), pp 42‚Äì50. See also Se√°n √ì S√∫illeabh√°in, ‚ÄòSg√°th√°n an Chr√°bhaidh: Foins√≠ an aistri√∫ch√°in,‚Äô in: √âigse, 24 (1990), pp 26‚Äì36. √ì Maolchonaire omitted more than half of the original while making various additions of his own, one of which was specifically aimed at encouraging Irish Catholics to remain faithful. It appears to be the first formal application of Bellarmine and Su√°rez to the political situation in Ireland with √ì Maolchonaire rejecting the right of temporal princes to claim spiritual jurisdiction. At Antwerp in 1619, √ì Maolchonaire published De Augustini sensu circa b. Mariae Virginis conceptionem. O'Maolconaire was a scholastic theologian, especially in the writings of Augustine of Hippo on grace and free will. His Peregrinus Jerichontinus, hoc est de natura humana feliciter instituta, infeliciter lapsa, miserabiter vulnerata, misericorditer restaurata (ed. Thady MacNamara, Paris, 1641) treats of original sin, the grace of Christ and free will. Here, the \\"Pilgrim of Jerico\\" was human nature itself, with Satan the thief and the good Samaritan, Our Lord. Hunter says that this edition was owing to Arnauld who is possibly the author of the French version of 1645.

The term blonde refers to the natural color of the silk thread. Originally this lace was made with the natural- colored silk, and later in black. Most blonde lace was also made in black. It was made in the 18th and 19th centuries. The pattern, which is generally of flowers, is made with a soft silk thread, thicker than the thread used for the ground. This causes a big contrast between the flowers and the ground. It uses the same stitches as Chantilly lace and Lille lace, and is similarly made in strips 5 inches wide and invisibly joined. Blonde lace is not as good as Chantilly lace though, as the ground isn't as firm, nor is the pattern as regular. Blonde lace became very popular, and replaced Mechlin lace. It is very soft, and thus was well suited to the gathered trimmings fashionable during the nineteenth century. Blonde lace was used by royalty, and was worn in the portraits of the daughter of George IV, Princess Charlotte in 1817, and of Queen Adelaide in 1830. In 1805 blonde lace was popular in Paris. Blonde lace was made in Caen from 1744, in parts of Flanders, in Barcelona, and, in small quantities, in the east Midlands of England from about 1806. It didn't suffer when other lacemakers were reduced to the brink of ruin in 1821 to 1832 by the introduction of machine-made bobbin net. In fact, the demand for blonde actually increased, and Caen exported great quantities, by smuggling, to England. It was one of the earliest laces to be copied by machine- in 1833 the traverse warp machine (invented in 1811) made it for a full season, and it was sold without saying it was machine-made, at handmade prices, with no one the wiser. By 1840 blonde lace was out of favor. Spanish blonde lace Blonde lace from Spain, early 19th c. There was a lot of blonde lace made in Spain, mostly in the Catalonia region, and especially in Barcelona. It had all the same qualities as blonde lace made elsewhere, with very large flowers. It was used mainly for mantillas and scarves and became part of the archetypical image of a Spanish lady.

Although similar in many respects to adventure travel, jungle tourism pertains specifically to the context of region, culture and activity. According to the Glossary of Tourism Terms, jungle tours have become a major component of green tourism in tropical destinations and are a relatively recent phenomenon of Western international tourism. Of the regions that take part in tourism-driven sustainable development practices and eco tourism, Mexican, Central and South American practices are the most pervasive in the industry; notably Mayan jungle excursions. Other regions include jungle territories in Africa, Australia, and the South Pacific.  Central and South America  Chichen Itza in Mexico, a World Heritage Site The Tikal in Guatemala Cop√°n in Honduras The majority of jungle tour operators are concentrated in what is known as the Mayan World or \\"Ruta Maya\\". The Mayan World encompasses five countries that hosted the entirety of the Mayan Civilization: Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador. Most tours consist of visits to popular Mayan archaeological sites such as Tikal, Guatemala, Chichen Itza, and Copan. These day visits will usually consist of a guided tour of a heavily tourist- concentrated Mayan and archaeological site. Tikal and Chichen Itza are prime examples of popular day-visit sites. Such sites involve a tour guide, designated either by the state government or by a private company, for the tourists. These tour guides are predominantly trained professionals, certified to take large parties of fifty through heavily populated archaeological sites. Nicaragua and Costa Rica are also popular destinations for this type of adventure travel. Although most of the visits to these more prominent sites involve day trips, there are also many jungle tour operators that showcase less-known, remote Mayan jungle ruins such as Nakum, Yaxha, and El Mirador. These tours involve much more preparation, time and funding to explore as they are usually in very remote and generally inaccessible regions of the Mayan jungles. These ruins and sites are reached by alternative and physically taxing means of travel such as bicycle, canoe, horseback or hiking. This is what essentially differentiates jungle tourism from any other sort of adventure travel tours. There are several tour operators that will employ the use of machetes during tours. Another difference is that the majority of tour operators that travel deep into the Central and South American jungle will cap the number of persons traveling in the group at ten to fifteen. This is done to minimize the impact on the jungle flora and fauna. Federal laws in some countries prohibit any given group larger than fifteen people traveling through the Mayan jungle, a generally protected region, but limited resources for enforcing such laws have allowed such practices to occur under the radar. In Guatemala it has become very popular to hike through the jungle of the Mayan Biosphere due to the discovery of El Mirador, also known as the Lost City of Maya. There are no roads. Many take a quick flight from Flores while others hike through the jungles of the department of Pet√©n. Groups should be smaller than 15 people in order to reduce the impact on the environment.

The Beirut Nights are numbers of events that take place from time to time in Beirut, Lebanon. It's usually active in the summer; however, some other festivals might happen in spring or fall. Beirut Central District has been chosen for many times to hold such occasions whereas others preferred to have their \\"nights\\" in exquisite bars and nightclubs. The city is known of its huge crowd from different nationalities participating in these events. Over the years, Beirut witness many concerts or performances that include classical music, dance, theatre, opera, jazz, and modern world music. Many theatre plays have been part of such events by the passage of time like La Com√©die Fran√ßaise. On the other hand, highlights of downtown Beirut are considered to be related to youth culture while the Byblos International Festival, the Baalbeck International Festival and the Beiteddine Festival are the base of classical highlights in Lebanon. The 2000 AFC Asian Cup was also held in Beirut and basically in Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium which is the most famous in the capital. The National Museum of Beirut is the principal archaeology museum in the country where artistic paintings, statues and Literature are found. The current exhibition numbers 1300 artifacts dating from prehistoric times to the Arab conquest.

Highlights After participating in thousands of festivals, Lebanon's Fairuz appeared in 1994 at the Martyrs' Square, Beirut in front of hundreds of crowds. She returned to BIEL in December, 2006, to be a part of a three-day performance. In 1999, Luciano Pavarotti performed a charity benefit concert in Beirut, to mark Lebanon's reemergence on the world stage after the civil war. The concert held in Beirut was the largest since the end of the war, it was attended by 20,000 people who traveled from countries as distant. It was the tenor's only concert in the Middle East.

The president's and prime minister's wives were among those who attended Carey's 90-minute concert, and first in the Middle East, organized by the Beiteddine Festival Committee. Phil Collins was another worldwide celebrity to visit Lebanon on 5 November 2005. Collins was a part of a charity concert for children cancer at BIEL; that went to the Children's Cancer Center Of Lebanon; which treats youngsters with the disease regardless of their ability to pay.

Cultural interaction and economic trade between Indus Valley and Mesopotamia date back to 1800 BCE. The 1952 Treaty of Friendship established and strengthened ties between contemporary India and Iraq. By the 1970s, Iraq was regarded as one of India's closest allies in the Middle East. Ties between India and Iraq were disrupted during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War. However, the bilateral relations normalised after the establishment of democratic government in Iraq. History =Ties between Shias in Iraq and Shias in India= Roots of North Indian Shi'ism in Iran and Iraq: Religion and State in Awadh, 1722‚Äì1859 by J.R.I. Cole. Shi'i Indians funded the Hindiyya canal in the Iraqi city of Najaf. North India's Awadh (Oudh) state was Shi'i and it provided funding to the Iraqi Shi'i shrine cities of Karbala and Najaf, channeling the money towards Persian mujtahids in the cities. The Hindiyya canal was finished in 1803 and money was able to be channeled to the Shi'i shrines cities like Najaf from India and Iran because western colonization did not touch Shi'i areas until the end of the 19th century. Mir Jafar was an Iraqi Shia Arab from Najaf who moved to India and became the Nawab of Bengal. The Iraqi Shia writer and poet Muzaffar Al-Nawab is of Indian descent.http://www.alkitab.com/15748.htmlhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Poetic- Muzaffar-al-Nawab-Nawab-Yuqub/dp/9933402293 Iraq was one of the few countries in the Middle East with which India established diplomatic relations at the embassy level immediately after its independence in 1947.US-Iraq War: India's Middle East policy Both nations signed the \\"Treaty of Perpetual Peace and Friendship\\" in 1952 and an agreement of co-operation on cultural affairs in 1954. India was amongst the first to recognise the Baath Party-led government, and Iraq remained neutral during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. However, Iraq sided alongside other Gulf States in supporting Pakistan against India during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which saw the creation of Bangladesh. Nonetheless, Iraq and India continued to maintain strong economic and military ties. During the early 1980s, the Indian Air Force was training more than 120 Iraqi MiG-21 pilots. The security relationship was expanded in 1975, when the Indian Army sent training teams and the Indian Navy established a naval academy in Basra. India continued to provide considerable military assistance to Iraq through the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. In addition to training, India provided technical assistance to the Iraqi Air Force through a complicated tripartite arrangement involving France. The eight-year-long Iran‚ÄìIraq War caused a steep decline in trade and commerce between the two nations. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, India was opposed to the use of force against Iraq. India stopped the refueling of military planes after the second week of war in 1991. Iraq had been one of India's largest export markets before the 1991 gulf war. It opposed UN sanctions on Iraq, but the period of war and Iraq's isolation further diminished India's commercial and diplomatic ties. Iraq had supported India's right to conduct nuclear tests following its tests of five nuclear weapons on May 11 and May 13, 1998. In 2000, the then-Vice President of Iraq Taha Yassin Ramadan visited India, and on August 6, 2002 President Saddam Hussein conveyed Iraq's \\"unwavering support\\" to India over the Kashmir dispute with Pakistan.India, Iraq Agree on Co-operation India and Iraq established joint ministerial committees and trade delegations to promote extensive bilateral co-operation.Iraq prizes ties with India: SaddamIraq Economic and Commercial Relations =Economic ties and Oil-for-Food Programme= Former Minister for External Affairs K. Natwar Singh possibly received illegal kickbacks from Iraq over the Oil-for-Food programme. India's ties with Iraq suffered due to the UN sanctions on Iraq, but India soon developed trade within the Oil-for-Food programme, which permitted Iraq to export oil for essential goods. However, a 2005 investigation of the programme revealed that the then-Indian minister of external affairs Natwar Singh and the congress party had possibly received kickbacks from the Baathist regime, leading to his resignation and at the request of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.India's Foreign Minister Fired Post-2003 India had preserved its neutrality over the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, criticising the lack of UN approval, but also hinted that it would consider sending troops to post-war Iraq to help maintain security and peace after a unanimous vote in the UN Security Council over the Coalition's presence and mission in Iraq.India will consider sending troops However this was ruled out after protests from public and political parties which have been opposing USA. It normalised its ties with the new democratically elected government of Iraq in 2005, seeking to restart trade and co-operation. Indian businesses applied for contracts for reconstruction projects to the Iraqi government, and more recently the activities of Iraqi businesses in India have been growing rapidly. Iraq is one of the major suppliers of crude oil to India, exporting 220,000 barrels of oil per day to Indian Oil Corporation. In 2013 June, Foreign Minister of India, Mr. Salman Khurshid visited Iraq regarding security and business issues, the first to do so since 1990. =Iraqi Kurdistan= Gandhi statue in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan There has been limited diplomatic relations between India and Iraqi Kurdistan. India purchases Kurdish crude oil sold through Turkish companies. Several Indian citizens work in Iraqi Kurdistan. Many Kurds travel to India for educational or medical purposes. In July 2014, Hemin Hawrani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party's international relations wing, told The Hindu that he hoped for deeper political and economic ties with India, describing the country as \\"an important partner\\". Hawrani also expressed his desire to see the Indian government open a consulate in Erbil, and invited Indian companies to invest in Kurdistan.http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/kurdish-leadership- calls-for-better-india-ties/article6170941.ece In November 2014, the Indian government sent special envoy Ambassador Suresh K. Reddy to visit Kurdistan and meet Kurdish government officials. Reddy stated that India \\"fully supports the Kurdistan Region during this difficult time\\", and expressed confidence in the Kurdish government and the Peshmerga forces to preserve the stability and security of the region. The Ambassador also praised the role of Peshmerga forces in fighting ISIL, and announced that the Indian government would open a consulate in Kurdistan.http://dfr.gov.krd/a/d.aspx?l=12&a;=44267 See also * Saddam Beach, a village in Kerala, India named after former Iraqi President Saddam Hussain.

The club started out as Club Caverns - a small establishment in the basement of a drugstore - famous for its floor and variety shows. The club was frequented by many of Washington's elite at the time who would come to see such musical artists as Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway. In the 1950s, the club's name was changed to Crystal Caverns and then to Bohemian Caverns. In 1959, promoter Tony Taylor and Angelo Alvino bought the club and transformed it into the premier jazz venue in Washington, D.C. Taylor booked many of the leading jazz musicians of the 1960s including Bill Evans, Miles Davis, Shirley Horn, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Bobby Timmons, Nina Simone, and Charles Mingus. In 1964, Ramsey Lewis recorded the critically and commercially successful album, The Ramsey Lewis Trio at the Bohemian Caverns. By 1968, the club began to lose business. The financial strains and the civil disturbances following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led Taylor and Alvino to close the club in September 1968. Thirty years later, as a re-development of the U Street area was underway, the club was purchased by Amir Afshar and re-opened. Beginning in 2006, Bohemian Caverns was under the direction of club manager Omrao Brown. Due to chronic financial problems, Bohemian Caverns went out of business and vacated the building at the end of March 2016. http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/47998/bohemian- caverns-to-close-legendary-u-street-jazz-club/ See also * List of jazz venues References Category:Nightclubs in Washington, D.C.

A full merger of the parties has been debated for decades, as a result of a shrinking National Party vote. It is argued that the decline in the National vote is linked to a declining rural population, and National Party policies have become increasingly similar to those of the Liberal Party. Additionally, in the states and territories of Australia, the parties' affiliates have worked in coalition on multiple occasions. Additionally, the Country Liberal Party of the Northern Territory has been affiliated with both parties since its formation, and in July 2008 the National Party of Australia ‚Äì Queensland and Liberal Party of Australia (Queensland Division) merged to become the Liberal National Party of Queensland. History In Queensland, the only state where the Nationals were the dominant coalition partner in state politics after Lawrence Springborg's re-election as party leader, support emerged ‚Äî especially on the National side ‚Äî for a merger of coalition parties to address the declining National (rural) vote and Labor domination of all levels of government. In March 1973, former Prime Minister William McMahon publicly announced his support for a merger. McMahon reiterated his view after Labor won the 1974 election, and Billy Snedden, his successor as leader of the Liberal Party, also stated that he favoured a merger. During the 1980s, former Nationals MP Peter Nixon reviewed the party and \\"concluded it should seriously consider amalgamating with the Liberals\\". Former Nationals leader Doug Anthony wrote not long afterward, \\"Any objective and rational National Party member who read this report would have to accept that amalgamation was the only realistic course. Regrettably, there are still too many who don't want to read it and who don't want to face reality, that the role of a specialist party looking after the needs of rural people is in decline.\\" In July 1989, Senator Fred Chaney, the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, stated his tentative support for a merger, but noted that it could not be led by politicians and should come from the grassroots. At the 2007 federal election, the National Party's vote declined to 5.49 percent, with the party winning only 10 of 150 seats (an all-time low). Only one National seat, the Hinkler in Queensland, was classified by the Australian Electoral Commission as provincial (predominantly rural), compared to four held by the Liberals and 16 by Labor. The election was indicative of declining support for the Nationals. The party's parliamentary representation fell in each of the four Australian elections between 1998 and 2007, and the party's vote in this period never exceeded six percent (compared to an average voting result of 8-11 percent for the Nationals over the previous two decades). The Nationals vote declined further to 4.51% at the 2019 federal election.

After Kolodziejzyk's retirement in 1994, the Image Club division was purchased back from Adobe Systems by Image Club employee Brad Zumwalt and a group of investors. The division was renamed Eyewire, and was eventually sold to Getty Images. Another major spin-off credited to Image Club software and marketing innovations, was istockphoto.com which was started by two former Image Club employees Bruce Livingston and Kolodziejzyk‚Äôs brother in-law Patrick Lor. In 1986, Kolodziejzyk launched his second company, Sharper Cards, which made and sold printed dental marketing products. In 2003 Greg and his wife and business partner Helen (who was also acting CEO of Sharper Cards), sold the company to their largest US competitor, Smart Health, Inc., based in Phoenix. In 2000, Kolodziejzyk changed focus to improving his health. In eight years, he completed 12 Ironman Triathlons and qualified and competed at the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii by winning 4th place in his division at Ironman Arizona in 2006. He has finished numerous marathons including the Boston Marathon, many 50 mile ultramarathons, and placed 4th over all at the 2010 San Francisco One Day ultramarathon running 101.8 miles in 24 hours. In 2012, Kolodziejzyk ran the treacherous 75 km long, West Coast Trail, solo in 26 hours. In 2008, Kolodziejzyk launched human-power.com where he worked as a motivational speaker. He planned an ocean crossing by human power in 2010, but later decided not to continue the trip.http://adventuresofgreg.com/blog/2010/11/11/within-is-for-sale/ In 2014, Kolodziejzyk competed in the MR340 river race by pedaling his human powered boat 340 miles down the Missouri River placing 1st in his division with a finishing time of 57 hours, 12 minutes. In 2015, Kolodziejzyk launched theAlgolab.com where he currently works as an algorithmic trading strategy developer and trader. Kolodziejzyk has been featured on Discovery Channel Canada's show Daily Planet twice, on the cover and two-page spread in Popular Science magazine, featured in Men's Journal, Wired magazine, National Geographic, Explore, and the 2009 and 2010 editions of the Guinness World Records book.

History =Foundation= Prva Petoletka facility (archive) \\"Prva Petoletka\\"-Trstenik was founded on 23 March 1949, by decision of the Government of People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at the beginning of the first Five-year plan of development, after which it was named. =1980s= The factory entered its \\"golden era\\" during the 1980s. During this time the factory had nearly 20,000 employees. The design offices of Prva Petoletka designed hydraulic systems for many of the hydroelectric power plants in Yugoslavia, the hydraulic drive on a class of massive roto- excavators for surface mines, drive- and control-systems for the sets of the National Theatre in Belgrade, electro-hydraulic system for lifting of the main dome of the Temple of Saint Sava in Belgrade, hydraulics for a modern second- generation tank (the M-84), an inclined marine railway installed in the shipyard in Kladovo, landing gear for Boeing, as well as many large centralized lubrication systems in Yugoslavia. Prva Petoletka was an important exporter, delivering its products to over 30 countries on several continents. At the height of production, PPT exported about 40% of its products. Petoletka cooperated with major world companies such as Boeing, Bugatti, Lucas, Bendix, Daimler, Martin Merkel, Pol-Mot, Orsta Hydraulik, Wabco Westinghouse, Linde Guldner, Ermeto, and Zahnradfabrik. Prva Petoletka was contracted to lift the 4000 ton central dome of the Cathedral of Saint Sava in 1989. The height of the dome was 37 metres prior to its retrofit and together with the ten metre cross it weighed 40,000 kN. The dome was lifted to a height of 43 m. Arch carriers and pendentives occupy the rest of the space between the dome and the supporting construction. The lifting process was very slow and took forty days to complete. =1990‚Äì2001= In the 1990s Yugoslavia collapsed and war started in Croatia and Bosnia. International sanctions were imposed by the United Nations, which led to political isolation and economic decline for Serbia. This resulted in a crisis for the factory and its workers when PPT lost its ability to export products. Many high-profile engineers left Petoletka during the 1990s and started their own private companies. The state did not have funds to invest in factory machines and equipment and this resulted in most of factory's equipment becoming obsolete. =2001‚Äì2016= Former logo of Prva Petoletka Since the 2000s, the PPT has sought privatization. The first tender for the sale of Prva Petoletka, held in June 2005, was unsuccessful. The second tender, opened in November 2007, also failed. The government decided to sell the factory in parts rather than as a whole because of the lack of interested parties to buy entire company. In 2009, an agreement was reached with the Russian company \\"Bummash\\" from Izhevsk, but deal failed once again. After that, restructuring of PPT has started and some members of the group have already found strategic partners. During the 2010s, the company maintained production facilities in Trstenik, Vrnjacka Banja, Brus, Aleksandrovac, Novi Pazar, Leposavic, and Belgrade in Serbia and Bijelo Polje in Montenegro. Its headquarters and main production facilities were located in Trstenik. In January 2016, after two decades of insolvency, the company has declared bankruptcy. =2016‚Äìpresent= In January 2016, a new business entity under name PPT-Namenska was registered and took most of Prva Petoletka's former employees. As of 2017, its main contractor is Russian Kamaz.

A coal mining and coke manufacturing center, Connellsville was the first settlement in what is now Emery County, inhabited from 1874 to 1878. The town now lies beneath the waters of Electric Lake. History In May 1874, the Fairview Coal Mining and Coke Company began mining in Coal Canyon to meet the demand for coke by Salt Lake City-area smelters. The company town built in the mining area was named Connellsville for the large coking center of Connellsville, Pennsylvania, but its population was small, only a few dozen miners and coke-oven workers. This was the first commercial coal mining operation in the Wasatch Plateau, pre-dating the coal mining boomtowns of Carbon County. The Connellsville coal made poor coke, however, and transportation facilities were lacking. By 1878 the project was deemed a failure, and the town was abandoned. Most of the miners moved over the mountain to Winter Quarters. After the closure of Connellsville, its coal was mined only occasionally, to meet residential heating needs in the Sanpete Valley. Several remnants of the ghost town, including cabins and coke ovens, still stood until the construction of the Electric Lake reservoir in 1973. Before the water covered Connellsville, Utah Power funded an archaeological survey of the area and reconstructed one of the coke ovens on a new site above the water line. The rest of the ghost town is underwater.

Founded in 1973/1974, it supports agrarian reform, and workers rights. In 1981 it won municipal elections, after which it formed the first socialist city council in Mexico. Foundation Coalici√≥n Obrera, Campesina, Estudiantil del Istmo (COCEI) Logo The COCEI was initially composed of indigenous Zapotec farmers and supported by portions of the local Juchit√°n society who were not in agreement with the government of the time. The COCEI was known for \\"organizing a discontented population\\" and linked to theories of democratic emergence and popular defense movements. Among the group's original goals, was securing changes to the electoral process in the Isthmus region, making them more transparent, seeking agrarian reform, and engaging in union movements for wage increases. The group's rapid expansion was noted as being due to its ability to diversify its goals and ideas and, through incorporating new sectors. In 1976, the COCEI won the election for the Communal Lands Commission. Municipal elections COCEI Protest In 1981, the COCEI won the municipal election in a coalition with the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico (PSUM) and founded the Popular City Council with the goal of \\"rescuing Zapotec culture\\" and achieving urban development with autonomy. The Popular City Council, and the COCEI electoral win, constituted the first socialist city council in Mexico; COCEI member Leopoldo de Gyves became mayor of Juchit√°n. The COCEI made the Zapotec people the focus of the election, advertising in their language and promoting indigenous culture. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party () (PRI) feared that the COCEI demands would create a \\"state within a state\\" through their actions. The Oaxaca state government began subordinating the Popular City Council, expropriating the functions of the city council to higher chambers of government. Rumors began to leak of the Popular City Council being linked to Guatemalan and Nicaraguan guerrilla fighters, a smear campaign began on TV, radio and news outlets, aldermen were murdered and the army took up presence at the local city offices and municipal palace. The Popular City Council however continued on with their social programs, starting literacy campaigns in shanty towns, coordinating with the Independent University of Guerrero to found the preparatory school and the Popular Teacher Training College of the Isthmus, and to begin the Popular City Council Radio, which aired without the permission of the government. Municipal officials repaired streets, built and refurbished local health centers, created a public library and rebuilt city hall. On August 3, 1983, the ruling PRI government called an extraordinary session of the federal Chamber of Deputies, removing all municipal powers, officially removing recognition of the COCEI. In response on August 6, a referendum was called by approximately 30,000 people from Juchit√°n. The result of the referendum was to continue to maintain the Popular City Council through self funding, despite of the governments attempts to dissolve the COCEI's control. On December 13, federal police officers and army soldiers evacuated the municipal palace, arresting 250 people. In response, thousands of people rallied at the city center, met by army units from Oaxaca and neighboring Veracruz, 150 additional prisoners were taken, effectively dissolving the COCEI government. With incoming President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-1994) came a shift in dealing with opposition groups. In 1989, the convertaci√≥n social project was launched. The project offered economic and political support for opposition groups in exchange for a cessation of militancy, and a public acknowledgment of coexistence with the Salinas government. The COCEI accepted and from 1986 to 1989, the COCEI participated in a coalition city government alongside the ruling PRI party. In 1989 the COCEI again won the Juchit√°n municipal elections, ruling until 1992. In 2007 the COCEI again won the municipal election, this time in a coalition with the Labor Party.

Education and academic life Susan Pharr received her B.A. (1966) with high honors from Emory University. In 1966-67, she was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. She earned her M.A. (1970) and Ph.D. (1975) in political science from Columbia University, where she specialized in comparative politics with a focus on Japan.Harvard, Arts & Sciences: Faculty curriculum vitae. Her interest in Japan was largely a matter of happenstance. As a first-year graduate student looking for recreation and a few self-defense skills for the streets of New York City, she signed up for a judo class that turned out to be made up almost entirely of Japanese black belts who were fellow Columbia students. Talking with her judo classmates and venturing in their company for sushi piqued her interest sufficiently to spur her to take courses on Japanese society and politics with James William Morley, Herbert Passin, and, later on, Gerald Curtis. In an intellectual world that was galvanized by the question of what made countries succeed or fail politically and economically, she found the study of Meiji Japan riveting and soon made Japan the center of her doctoral work in comparative politics. While completing her dissertation, she launched her career at the Social Science Research Council in New York, where from 1974-76 she served as Staff Associate for its Japan Committee, a post later held, coincidentally, by her Reischauer Institute colleague Theodore C. Bestor. In 1977 she became an Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1980. On leave from Wisconsin she spent 1983 in the Agency for International Development, where she was assigned responsibility for improving U.S.-Japan aid coordination, and two years, from 1985‚Äì87, as Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C. Pharr joined the Harvard faculty in 1987. She has served as Director of Harvard's Program on U.S.-Japan Relations since 1987 and became Edwin O. Reischauer Professor of Japanese Politics in 1991. From 1992-95 she served as chair of the Government Department. In 1995-96, she held the Edwin O. Reischauer Professor of Japanese Studies. In 1996-98, she was as Associate Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. She has been the Director of the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies since 2004 through the present.Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies (RIJS), Director, 2004-present As an active participant in university life at Harvard, Dr. Pharr is on the Steering Committee of the Asia Center and on the Executive Committee of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.

He served as a close advisor and architect of Emperor Henry IV. In 1080 he founded the Benedictine abbey of Iburg Castle. Life He was born at L√∂hningen (today part of √úhlingen- Birkendorf) in Klettgau, Swabia, the son of a ministerial family. His parents sent him at an early age to the monastic schools of Stra√üburg and Reichenau where the learned Herman Contractus was then teaching. Together with William I, Archbishop of Strasbourg, he went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem about 1040. Having completed his education, he taught for some time at the cathedral school of Speyer in Rhenish Franconia. In 1047 he became teacher at the Benedictine school of Goslar in Saxony and, shortly after, was made headmaster of the cathedral school at Hildesheim, where he reformed the education at the behest of Bishop Azelin. In Speyer, he had contacted the Imperial court of the Salian emperor Henry III. On account of his skill in architecture he was appointed imperial architect and, as such, supervised the construction of numerous castles and churches in the Holy Roman Empire. When the Rhine, which flowed close to the Cathedral of Speyer, threatened to undermine its foundations, Benno saved the structure by changing the course of the river. He and Bishop Azelin of Hildesheim accompanied Henry on a 1051 campaign against King Andrew I of Hungary, whereby Benno distinguished himself in providing the forces' catering. Upon his return he was made provost of Hildesheim, archpriest at Goslar Cathedral and royal vicedominus at the Imperial Palace. Benno's great talent was also recognized by the emperor's son and successor King Henry IV. Stuck in the rising Saxon conflict, Henry IV strongly relyed on his abilities as a master builder of several castles in the mainland of Saxony, such as the Harzburg finished in 1068. When the ambitious Cologne archbishop Anno II tried to bring him over to his side, the emperor designated him the successor of Bishop Benno I of Osnabr√ºck who had died the past year. Benno did a lot to promote the economic and agricultural development in his diocese, however, when in 1073 Henry's quarrels with the Saxon nobility culminated in open revolt, he had to seek protection at the royal court. He and Archbishop Liemar of Bremen remained close companions of the king, when Henry fled from Saxony and had to consent to the humiliating Treaty of Gerstungen. During the fierce Investiture Controversy between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV, Benno for a long time sided with the emperor. He were among the clerics who, led by Archbishop Siegfried of Mainz, declared Gregory deposed at the 1076 Synod of Worms. Benno, like numerous other German and Italian bishops, signed the formula of deposition and incurred ecclesiastical excommunication a few weeks later. With some other excommunicated bishops, Benno hastened to Italy, where the pope freed them from the ban at Canossa Castle. He successfully arbitrated between the adversaries, before Henry himself arrived here to do penance on his Walk to Canossa. However, the tranquility did not last long. In March 1077 several princes elected Rudolf of Rheinfelden antiking and in 1080 Pope Gregory again excommunicated Henry and all his supporters. While Rudolf was killed in the Battle on the Elster, Benno and several bishops met in a synod at Brixen, where Gregory was again declared deposed and Archbishop Guibert of Ravenna was elected antipope. In turn, Hermann of Salm was elected antiking and Benno's diocesan territories were devastated by the insurgents. With Archbishop Liemar of Bremen he commissioned the anti-papal polemic by the Osnabr√ºck canon Wido,I. S. Robinson, Authority and Resistance in the Investiture Contest: The Polemical Literature of the Late Eleventh Century p. 152, 159. around 1085. (However, he did not author the Gesta Romanae ecclesiae contra Hildebrandum of Cardinal Beno.) On the other hand, Benno tried to bring about a reconciliation, winning over rebellious nobles such as Margrave Egbert II of Meissen and even negotiating with the Roman Curia while the troops of Henry IV laid siege to the pope in the Castel Sant'Angelo. Upon Gregory's death at Salerno in 1085, Benno retired to the monastery at Iburg Castle near Osnabr√ºck, which he had founded in 1080. In a little house near the monastery he lived according to the rule of the monks during the week, while on Sundays and holidays he assisted at his cathedral in Osnabr√ºck. He died at Iburg three years later. Legacy From humble origins, Benno made a remarkable career, not only because his abilities were needed and appreciated, but also due to his social skills and his beneficial relations. However, his close ties with ecclesiastical and secular authorities imposed considerable difficulties during the fierce conflict between the church and state that overshadowed his lifetime. StrunckWestphalia Saneta, Paderborn, 1855. and HeitemeyerDie Heiligen Deutschlands, Paderborn, 1889. include him in the list of saints. KerlerDie Patronate der Heiligen, Ulm, 1905. says that he is invoked against grasshoppers, because he once dispersed them by his prayers.

It is seen as a very traditional cake and the tea loaf is available in cafes and other establishments that serve traditional afternoon tea. It is particularly associated with Yorkshire. In the making of tea loaves, the fruit (usually currants and sultanas) is soaked in initially hot tea to plump it before mixing it into the batter. The fruit is left in the tea for several hours, or overnight, and so is mainly steeped in cold tea. The tea used to make the cake was traditionally black tea, but Earl Grey and other teas can also be used. Eggs are beaten into the tea/fruit mixture to bind the ingredients together and then the flour, sugar and any ground spices (such as mixed spice or cinnamon alone) are added. Yeast used to be used as the raising agent but self-raising flour is specified in modern recipes. Although currants and sultanas are traditional fruits, other can also be used such as glace cherries, crystallised ginger, dried apricots, peel or orange zest. A key feature of tea bread is the lack of fat in the recipe with the consequence of improved keeping qualities. Indeed, the flavour is often considered to improve with time. Similar breads in the British Isles include the Welsh bara brith and the Irish barmbrack.

This summer dish was a part of the Korean royal court cuisine.  Ingredients and preparation  In modern South Korea, aehobak has largely replaced Oriental pickling melon for making the dish, due to the latter vegetable's rarity. Sometimes, cucumber or eggplant are used instead. Other common ingredients include beef, shiitake or oyster mushrooms, and chapssal-bukkumi (pan-fried glutinous rice cake). When wolgwa-chae is served in school meals, beef is often replaced with pork and bukkumi with tteokmyeon (rice cake noodles). To make the dish, the melon or replacement vegetable is seeded, thinly sliced, lightly salted, and squeeze- drained to remove moisture. Beef, mushrooms, and other vegetables are julienned, and each of the ingredients is separately seasoned and stir-fried. Aromatics such as scallions and garlic may be added when stir-frying the ingredients. Thin bukkumi, made with glutinous rice flour into circles around in diameter, may be used either whole or julienned. Stir-fried ingredients are mixed together with sesame oil, ground black pepper, and crushed toasted sesame seeds. When served, the dish may be topped with crushed pine nuts, chili threads, and egg garnish.

In 2006, the team moved into the Indy Pro Series (now called the Firestone Indy Lights Series) and made headlines quickly by winning the second and third races of the season on the Streets of St. Petersburg with driver Raphael Matos. The team continued on into 2007 and ran a two car effort for most of the season, running Sean Guthrie, Jim Guthrie's 20-year-old son, for the entire year and Tom Wieringa for the majority of the races. Guthrie Racing ran four cars for the 2008 season in the Firestone Indy Lights Series with drivers Sean Guthrie, Logan Gomez, Franck Perera and Micky Gilbert. The 4th car has also been driven by Robbie Pecorari who achieved a 2nd-place finish at Kansas Speedway after starting 23rd on the grid, and Tom Wieringa who made history by becoming the oldest driver to compete in the series at age 52. Franck Perera joined the team beginning at the Iowa race June 21, 2008 after losing his IndyCar Series ride with Conquest Racing due to his sponsor going bankrupt. He captured the team's only win of the season in one of the two races held at Infineon Raceway. Prior to the 2009 Indy Lights season, Louis (Butch) Meyer III bought into the team and it became Guthrie Meyer Racing.

He probably studied at the municipal Latin School in 's-Hertogenbosch, where Macropedius was teaching. After that, Torrentinus must have worked for printers and booksellers in Antwerp, Basel, Lyon and Venice. Since 1532-1533 he lived in Bologna. Here he was a bookseller together with his fellow countryman, the great Greek scholar Arnoldus Arlenius, operating under the business name \\"Libreria del Thodesco\\". Title page of Francesco Guicciardini's 'La Historia di Italia', Printed by Lawrence Torrentinus (Florence 1561). Their business was near the San Andrea della Scuole chapel in the centre of Bologna. They imported Latin and Greek books from France and Germany and sold books all over Italy and beyond. Moreover, they were brokers in manuscripts: they made contacts between manuscript owners and authors on the one hand and printers and publishers on the other hand. Torrentinus, who was called Lorenzo Torrentino in Italy, married Nicolosia de Amicis from Bologna on July 14, 1543. He was invited to Florence by the Duke Cosimo de' Medici in 1546. In 1547 he opened his press in Garbo close to the Church of S. Romolo. Being the Duke‚Äôs printer, Torrentino produced as many as 275 different books. Among them were works of authors such as Alberti, Giovio, Guicciardini, Camillo and Vasari. Torrentino‚Äôs company flourished and it offered works of high quality. One of his most famous publications was the Digesta, the codification of Roman Law, in 1553. Title page of Digestorum seu Pandectarum, etc. Printed by Lawrence Torrentinus (Florence 1553). Between 1554 and 1555 he worked in Pescia. His first wife died between 1552 and 1557. On September 19, 1558 Torrentino married Lucretia Albertinelli, a widow from Florence. In 1562 he was summoned in Mondov√¨ to manage and direct the typography foundry there by will of the Duke Emannuel Filiberto. Lorenzo Torrentino died in Florence on February 2, 1563. The press was later on managed by his sons Leonardo, Romolo and Bonaventura. Lorenzo Torrentino contributed to the interchanging of ideas north and south of the Alps. Moreover, he contributed to the development of the Tuscan and Italian language. References * Gustavo Bertoli, 'Contributo alla Biografia di Lorenzo Torrentino Stampatore Ducale a Firenze', in: L.

Life  Bayan was born into a family with military background. Many of his family members had served as soldiers during the Mongolian conquest of Eurasia. In 1307, Bayan himself received the title \\"Baturu\\".History of Yuan,vol.138 During the reign of K√ºl√ºg Khan, Bayan was appointed to a number of positions in the court. He became a Darughachi in 1309, and then held several provincial posts during the reign of Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan, namely the Tong Pingzhangshi (vaguely, the \\"vice prime minister\\") of Jiangzhe province, Jiangxi province and Henan province. It is said that he did not tolerate any local bullies who took advantage of the poor. At the turn of the 13th/14th centuries Bayan and the Turk El Tem√ºr were members of the group around Qaishan, a nephew of Tem√ºr Khan who was appointed to defend Mongolia against the Chagatai Khanate under Kaidu, the grandson of √ñgedei. In one battle, he repelled and chased the √ñgedeid army; and was given the title of Baghatur. After Tem√ºr's death, Qaishan emerged as the new Yuan emperor, and Bayan was among those who received an official position as a reward. Later, Bayan was governor of Henan. Historians describe him as a traditionalist who attempted to preserve Mongolian culture while he is seen as a violent aristocrat by some.Ch.Dalai-–ú–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª—ã–Ω —Ç“Ø“Ø—Ö 1260-1388 Bayan Khutugh was his niece. In 1328 Bayan rendered great service during the enthronement of Jayaatu Khan. The Khan rewarded him with the position of left chancellor, along with countless pieces of gold and silver as well as privileges in the court. In the conflicts about the succession of Jayaatu Khan Tugh Tem√ºr after 1332, Bayan broke with El Tem√ºr and supported Toghon Tem√ºr, who ascended the throne in 1333 (and who would lose China in 1368). He was appointed commander of kheshig, composed of Mongols, Kypchaks, Russians and Asud in 1334. Until 1335 Bayan succeeded in annihilating El Tem√ºr's sons and family. Bayan began concentrating in his person official positions that had not been so concentrated before. He implemented radical policies (or perhaps conservative policies from the Mongol point of view), abolishing the imperial examination system, and trying to contain the number of Han Chinese in the upper echelons of the Yuan bureaucracy. He once suggested the emperor kill those Han Chinese of the more numerous surnames: Zhang, Wang, Liu, Li and Zhao to suppress the rebellion.History of Yuan, vol.39 In 1339 he became grand chancellor (). By then, he had probably gone too far. In any case, he was toppled in 1340 by his nephew Toqto'a. Shortly after that, his purges were called off and his policies were reversed. According to Chinese historians, Toqto complained to his father that his uncle Bayan's authoritarian tendencies might bring disaster on their clan. Toghon Tem√ºr, the emperor, also began to worry about the exceedingly ostentatious power of Bayan. Wu Zhifang, a Confucian scholar in the court, suggested Toqto take action against Bayan. In the end, Bayan was removed from the central theatre of the imperial court.Chen,Bangzhan.

Jones (April 2, 1924 - July 25, 2018) was an American politician, who, prior to 2011, was the oldest member of the Texas House of Representatives,\\"Solons feeling the heat\\", Laredo Morning Times, April 12, 2010, p. 6A. having represented what became and what remains District 83 based in the area about Lubbock, Texas. Jones was originally elected as a Democrat in 1964, when that party held 149 of the 150 seats in the Texas House.The only Republican in the Texas House in 1965 was the late Frank Kell Cahoon, a Wichita Falls native who resides still in Midland. In 2012, the Democrats held only 48 of the 150 House seats. Jones was defeated for re-nomination in 1972 by cotton farmer Pete Laney of Hale Center, later the House Speaker. After a 12-year absence, Jones returned to the House in 1989 as a Republican. Background A Lubbock resident, Jones earned his living from farming and investments. He holds a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Texas Tech University. He married Reta A. Jones (July 16, 1923 - March 20, 2014), shortly after the end of his service in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. The two met in Lubbock's only bowling alley at the time. Mrs. Jones was heavily involved in Habitat for Humanity in Lubbock. Political life Jones's District 83 also included the outlying communities of Levelland, Denver City, Plains, Shallowater, Slaton, and Seminole, Texas. Jones drove through the district over the years in a 1995 Buick Le Sabre, passing out some 800,000 \\"Delwin Jones\\" emery boards to remind voters of pending elections. Jones often began his day of politicking meeting voters in some cafe. At eighty-six, Jones was a candidate for renomination in the April 13, 2010, Republican runoff primary. He was defeated by Charles Perry, an accountant who ran a grass roots campaign with support of the Tea Party movement, also known as \\"Taxed Enough Already\\". Perry prevailed with 10,109 votes (57.8 percent) to Jones' 7,392 ballots (42.2 percent). Jones polled 291 more votes in the runoff than he had in the primary, but Perry's total increased by 3,633 ballots over his initial showing. In the March 2 primary, Jones, backed by the president of the Lubbock Educators Association interest group, led the field with 7,103 ballots (37.7 percent) to Perry's 6,476 (34.4 percent). The third candidate, Zach Brady, with 5,240 votes (27.8 percent), held the key to victory in the Jones-Perry showdown. Brady, a Lubbock attorney, raised more than $250,000 and carried the backing of business interest groups, but he was eliminated from the race by his third-place showing. Jones had expected to win another term in the legislature on the basis of his name identification and longevity, but he conceded an \\"undercurrent\\" of disgruntled taxpayers made the outcome of the race uncertain. Charles Perry then ran unopposed for the House seat in the general election held on November 2, 2010. Currently, Republican Dustin Burrows, a Lubbock native, holds the House District 83 seat. In the Republican primary held on May 29, 2012, Jones, at the age of eighty-eight, failed in a bid to unseat Perry. In 2014, Jones entered the special election to fill the seat in the District 28 seat in Texas State Senate vacated by Robert L. Duncan, who became chancellor of the Texas Tech University System. In this race, he again faced Charles Perry as well as several other candidates, including two other Republicans, E. M. Garza and Jodey Arrington, and Democrat Greg Wortham. On August 31, 2014, Jones was listed in critical condition from an undisclosed illness. He was admitted to Covenant Medical Center in Lubbock. Perry won the election without the need for a runoff and thereby gained seniority over other new state senators who elected on November 4. Jones survived his illness. In 2015, Jones received the George Mahon Award, named for former U.S. Representative George Mahon, from the Lubbock Professional Chapter of the Association for Women in Communications. Death Jones died at the age of 94. He was interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin. Former state Senator Robert Duncan described Jones as \\"always involved in different types of activities, as a volunteer at the Lions Club, and ... active in the Republican Party, helping the new candidates learn the ropes and understand how to get elected.‚Äù References Category:1924 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:People from Lubbock, Texas Category:Texas Tech University alumni Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:Texas Democrats Category:Texas Republicans Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:United States Army soldiers Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Military personnel from Texas ","title":"Delwin Jones"},{"id":"17458511","text":"North Shore Road may mean: *Nevada State Route 28, along the north shore of Lake Tahoe *Nevada State Route 167, along the north shore of Lake Mead *Nevada State Route 169, along the north shore of Lake Mead *an unfinished road along the north shore of Fontana Lake, within Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina ","title":"North Shore Road"},{"id":"17458518","text":"Charles Minot \\"Minnie\\" Dole (1899‚Äì1976) was the founder of the National Ski Patrol.

Over centuries, there have been several Polish‚ÄìRussian Wars, with Poland once occupying Moscow and later Russia controlling much of Poland in the 19th as well as in the 20th century, damaging relations. Polish‚ÄìRussian relations entered a new phase following the fall of communism, 1989‚Äì1993. Since then, Polish‚ÄìRussian relations have at times seen both improvement and deterioration. According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 19 percent of Poles view Russia's influence positively while 49 percent express a negative view. However, since the Russian annexation of Crimea, over 60-80% Poles are worried over the future conflict with Russia, giving the fact Russia maintains control in Kaliningrad Oblast.Samuel Osborne. Russia could invade Poland \\"overnight\\" ‚Äì The Independence Historical =Poland and Ancient Russia= One of the earliest known events in Russian-Polish history dates back to 981, when the Grand Prince of Kiev, Vladimir Svyatoslavich, seized the Cherven cities from the Poles. The relationship between two by that time was mostly close and cordial, as there had been no serious wars between both. In 966, Poland accepted Christianity from Rome while Kievan Rus' - the ancestor of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus - was baptized by Constantinople. In 1054, the internal Christian divide formally split the Church into the Catholic and Orthodox branches separating the Poles from the Eastern Slavs. In 1018, Svyatopolk the Cursed who fled from Kiev turned for help to the Polish king Boleslav I the Brave, who defeated Yaroslav the Wise in a battle on the Bug River. The Kiev campaign of Boleslaw I was crowned with the capture of the city, but Boleslaw, instead of transferring power to Svyatopolk, began to rule in the city himself. In response, the people of Kiev raised an uprising, as a result of which they began to ‚Äúbeat the Poles‚Äù. Boleslaw fled with the treasury, and also took Yaroslav the Wise's sisters with him. The Cherven cities, were restored to Poland until conquered again by Yaroslav the Wise and his brother Mstislav the Brave in 1030-1031. A similar story took place in 1069, when the Grand Duke Izyaslav Yaroslavich ran to Poland to his nephew Boleslaw II the Bold, and he, having made a trip to Kiev, intervened in the Rus' dynastic dispute in favor of Izyaslav. According to legend, a relic sword named Shcherbets, which was used during the coronations of Polish kings, was notched when Boleslaw I or Boleslaw II struck the Golden Gate in Kiev. The first option can not be true due to the fact that the Golden Gate was built in the 1030s, the second is also not confirmed by the results of carbon dating of the sword, which, apparently, was created not earlier than the second half of the XII century. At the same time, Kievan Rus' and Poland also knew long periods of peaceful coexistence (for example, during the life of Vladimir after 981) and military alliances. Thus, the Polish king, Kazimierz I, concluded an alliance with Yaroslav the Wise in 1042, marrying the first to the sister of the Grand Duke Maria Dobroneg. In 1074, according to the chronicle, peace with Boleslaw II was signed in Suteisk by the Smolensk prince Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh, and in 1076 he together with the Volyn prince Oleg Svyatoslavich came to the aid of the Poles in a military campaign against the Czechs. The Grand Prince of Kiev, Svyatopolk Izyaslavich, made peace with the Polish king, Boleslaw III Krzywousty, who in 1103 married the daughter of Svyatopolk Sbyslav; when in Poland a struggle broke out between Boleslaw III and his brother Zbigniew, the Rus' troops came to the aid of the king and forced Zbigniew to recognize his power [1]. Like the principalities that arose from the disintegration of Kievan Rus', Poland experienced several Mongol invasions in the XIII century, however, despite the devastation, the Mongol yoke was not established, which subsequently provided Poland with an advantage in the development of trade, culture and public relations. In 1340, Vladimir Lvovich died, the last Galician heir to the Rurik dynasty, after which the Galician principality was inherited by Kazimierz III the Great and annexed to the Kingdom of Poland. =Muscovy and Russian Empire= Capitulation of Russian garrison of Smolensk before W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV of Poland in 1634 Relations between Poland and Muscovite Russia have been tense, as the increasingly desperate Grand Duchy of Lithuania involved the Kingdom of Poland into its war with Muscovy around 16th century. As Polish historian Andrzej Nowak wrote, while there were occasional contacts between Poles and Russians before that, it was the Polish union with Lithuania which brought pro-Western Catholic Poland and Orthodox Russia into a real, constant relation with both states engaged in \\"the contest for the political, strategic and civilizational preponderance in Central and Eastern Europe\\".Andrzej Nowak, The Russo-Polish Historical Confrontation, Sarmatian Review, January 1997 Issue While there were occasional attempts to create an alliance between the new Polish‚ÄìLithuanian state and the Muscovy (including several attempts to elect the Muscovite tsars to the Polish throne and create the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìMuscovite Commonwealth), they all failed. Instead, several wars occurred. Notably, during the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì18), Poland exploited Moscow's politically weakened state caused by civil war and Polish forces took Moscow ‚Äì an event that would become one of the many defining moments of the future Polish‚ÄìRussian relations.Peter Cheremushkin, \\"Russian- Polish relations: A long way from stereotype to reconciliation\\", Intermarium, vol. 5, no. 3. (2003), School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University Muscovy, now transforming into the Russian Empire, retaliated by taking advantage of the weakening Commonwealth, taking over disputed territories and moving its borders westwards in the aftermath of the Russo- Polish War (1654‚Äì67) and later participated in the destruction of the Commonwealth during the Swedish Deluge. By the beginning of the 18th century, with the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system (Golden Liberty) into anarchy, Russians were able to intervene in internal Polish affairs at will, politically and militarily, see (Silent Sejm, War of the Polish Succession). Around the mid-18th century, the influence of ambassadors and envoys from Russia to Poland, could be compared to those of colonial viceroys and the Commonwealth was seen by Russians as a form of protectorate. With the failure of the Bar Confederation opposing the Russian political and military influence in Poland, the First Partition took place in 1772, followed by the Second Partition, and the Third Partition of Poland. By 1795, the three partitions of Poland erased Poland from the map of Europe. As Nowak remarked, \\"a new justification for Russian colonialism gathered strength from the Enlightenment\\": occupied Poland was portrayed by the Russian authors as an anarchic, dangerous country whose Catholic and democratic ideas had to be suppressed by the 'more enlightened neighbors.' Over the next 123 years, a large part of Polish population and former territory would be subject to the rule of the Russian Empire. However, Poland was undergoing a cultural and political revival after the First Partition culminating in the Constitution of 3 May 1791 and the Kosciuszko Uprising in 1794. Several uprisings (most notably, the November Uprising and the January Uprising) would take place, attempting to regain Polish independence and stop the Russification and similar policies, aimed at removal of any traces of former Polish rule or Polish cultural influence, however only in the aftermath of the First World War would Poland regain independence (as the Second Polish Republic). =Soviet Union= Immediately after regaining independence in 1918, Poland was faced with a war with the new Bolshevik Russia, with the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War eventually ending up with a Polish victory at Warsaw, spoiling Lenin's plans of sending his Red Army west to spread the communist revolution. For the next two decades, Poland was seen by the Soviet Union as an enemy. The Soviet Union supported subversive activities of the Communist Party of Poland, Communist Party of Western Belarus, Communist Party of Western Ukraine. The NKVD killed 111,091 Poles in the Soviet Union during the Polish Operation and deported many families to Kazakhstan. Eventually a secret agreement with Nazi Germany allowed Germany and the Soviet Union to successfully invade and destroy the Second Republic in 1939. The following years of Soviet repressions of Polish citizens, especially the brutal mass murder in 1940, known as the Katyn massacre, of more than 20,000 Polish officers and its subsequent Soviet denial for 50 years, became additional events with lasting repercussions on the Polish‚ÄìRussian relations. In 1944, the Polish Home Army timed their capital's uprising to coincide with the approaching Red Army on the eastern suburbs of the city and the retreat of German forces. However, the Red Army stopped at the city limits and remained inactive there for several weeks. Also, the Soviet Union did not allow its Western Allies to use its nearby airports for airdrops into Warsaw for several weeks. This allowed the German forces to regroup and demolish the city while defeating the Polish resistance and causing between 150,000 and 200,000 civilian deaths. The tragic circumstances under which Poland's capital was liberated further strained the Polish‚ÄìRussian relations. At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Stalin was able to present his western allies, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, with a fait accompli in Poland. His armed forces were in occupation of the country, and his agents, the communists, were in control of its administration. The Soviet Union was in the process of incorporating the lands in eastern Poland, including the mass expulsion of the Polish population, which it had occupied between 1939 and 1941, after participating in the invasion and partition of Poland with Nazi Germany. Stalin was determined that Poland's new government would become his tool towards making Poland a Soviet puppet state controlled by the communists. He had severed relations with the Polish government-in- exile in London in 1943, but to appease Roosevelt and Churchill he agreed at Yalta that a coalition government would be formed. The Soviet Union supported Polish demands to be compensated by the loss of the former East of Poland, from which 2-3 millions Polish citizens were expelled, by German lands east of the rivers Oder and Lusatian Neisse which had homed 9 million Germans. Stalin allowed Polish authorities to man the Oder-Neisse Line as border, notwithstanding the lack of international consent for the new border, to prevent Germans from returning to their homes after the German capitulation. Many Poles were killed (e.g. during the August√≥w roundup) or deported to the Soviet Union. Joseph Stalin decided to create a communist, Soviet allied Polish state subservient to him, the People's Republic of Poland. Thus Poland became part of the Eastern Bloc, as the People's Republic of Poland. The Soviet Union had much influence over both internal and external affairs, and Red Army forces were stationed in Poland (1945: 500,000; until 1955: 120,000 to 150,000; until 1989: 40,000).Rao, B. V. (2006), History of Modern Europe Ad 1789-2002: A.D. 1789-2002, Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd. In 1945, Soviet generals and advisors formed 80% of the officer cadre of the Polish Armed Forces. The communists held a majority of key posts in this new government, and with Soviet support they soon gained almost total control of the country, rigging all elections. Many of their opponents decided to leave the country, and others were put on staged trials and sentenced to many years of imprisonment or execution. Soviet control over Poland lessened after Stalin's death and Gomu≈Çka's Thaw, and ceased completely after the fall of the communist government in Poland in late 1989, although the Soviet Northern Group of Forces did not leave Polish soil until 1993. Present President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Poland Leszek Miller in 2002 Modern Polish‚ÄìRussian relations begin with the fall of communism ‚Äì 1989 in Poland (Solidarity and the Polish Round Table Agreement) and 1991 in Russia (dissolution of the Soviet Union). With a new democratic government after the 1989 elections, Poland regained full sovereignty, and what was the Soviet Union, became 15 newly independent states, including the Russian Federation. Relations between modern Poland and Russia suffer from constant ups and downs. Among the constantly revisited issues is the fact that Poland has moved away from the Russian sphere of influence (joining NATO and the European Union) and pursuing an independent politic, including establishing a significant relations with post-Soviet states; for example, Poland was the first nation to recognize Ukraine's independence and Polish support for the pro-democratic Orange Revolution in 2004 in Ukraine has resulted in a temporary crisis in the Polish‚ÄìRussian relations.Richard Bernstein, After Centuries of Enmity, Relations Between Poland and Russia Are as Bad as Ever, New York Times, 3 July 2005. Occasionally, relations will worsen due to remembrance of uneasy historical events and anniversaries, such as when Polish politicians bring up the issue of Russia apologizing for the '39 invasion, the Katyn massacre (which many Polish citizens and politicians see as genocide, but Russian officials refer to as a war crime rather than a genocide), or for the ensuing decades of Soviet occupation; in turn, Russians criticize Poles' perceived lack of thankfulness for liberation from Nazi occupation. During the 1990s, assistance granted by Polish government and civilian agencies to members of the Chechen separatist movement had been met with criticism by Russian authorities.The Garden Times, Associated Press, \\"Information center a thorn in Polish-Russian relations\\", 31 May 1995. In 2009, there had been controversy over the Russian government and state media publishing claims that Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan and the Second Polish Republic had allied or intended to ally against the Soviet Union before the Second World War. These claims were denounced by Polish politicians and diplomats as an attempt at historical revision.Brisbane Times, Traynor, I., and Harding, L., \\"Survivor denounced pact as blaming the victim\\", 3 September 2009 Other issues important in the recent Polish‚ÄìRussian relations include the establishment of visas for Russian citizens, US plans for an anti-missile site in Poland, the Nord Stream pipeline (Poland, which imports over 90 percent of oil and 60 percent of gas from Russia, continues to be concerned about its energy security which the pipeline threatens to undermine), Polish influence on the EU‚ÄìRussian relations and various economic issues (ex. Russian ban on Polish food imports).Adam Grzeszak, Polish-Russian Relations: Bones of Contention Piling Up , Polityka, (PDF), 2006.Breaking the Ice?, Warsaw Voice, 20 February 2008. Retrieved 16 May 2008. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, with Lithuania, Ukraine and Belarus regaining independence, the Polish‚ÄìRussian border has mostly been replaced by borders with the respective countries, but there still is a 210 km long border between Poland and the Russian Kaliningrad exclave.

Dmitry Medvedev in Poland ‚Äì meeting with Donald Tusk =2010 plane crash= The BBC reported that one of the main effects of the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash would be the impact it has on Russian- Polish relations. It was thought if the inquiry into the crash were not transparent, it would increase suspicions toward Russia in Poland. The Wall Street Journal states that the result of the joint declaration by the PM's Vladimir Putin and Donald Tusk on Katyn on the verge of the crash, and the aftermath Russia's response has united the two nations, and presents a unique opportunity at a fresh start, ending centuries long rivalry and confrontation. =2011 dialog centers= Creation of parallel Polish and Russian dialogue centres was decided during President Medvedev's visit to Poland in December 2010.Wprost, Stworzenie Centrum Polsko-Rosyjskiego Dialogu ma poparcie sejmowej wiƒôkszo≈õci The Polish Centre for Polish-Russian Dialogue and Understanding supports cooperation of youth from both countries.

Poland has been a staunch supporter of tougher sanctions by the EU against Russia in response to these events. Poland's continued support of the new Ukrainian government and criticism of Russian interference has angered Russia and increased tensions between both countries. On 30 July 2014, Russia banned import of Polish fruit and vegetables amid the Ukraine sanctions war. Russia's food hygiene authorities said the imports had unacceptable levels of pesticide residues and nitrates. They earn Poland more than 1bn euros (¬£795m; $1.3bn) annually. Russia is Poland's biggest market for apples. The move follows EU sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. =Historical revisionism= Both Poland and Russia had accused each other for their historical revisionism. Russia has repeatedly accused Poland for not honoring Soviet soldiers fallen in World War II for Poland, notably in 2017, in which Poland was thought on \\"attempting to impose its own version of history\\" after Moscow was not allowed to join an international effort to renovate a World War II museum in Poland and destroyed monument honoring Soviet soldiers fallen in the war. Meanwhile, Poland also accuses Russia for its unlimited historical distortion, notably back to 2014 when Putin signed a bill using any comparison of Nazi to Soviet crimes as a punishment, as the Poles were also treated brutally by the Soviets; although Russia's historical revisionism might have influenced Poland's Andrzej Duda over its Nazi war crime laws; and Poland also has concerned that Russia's political and historical revisionism might put Poland at risk. Russian intelligence and influence operations in Poland The 1997 textbook Foundations of Geopolitics by a controversial Russian sociologist and philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, among other things, dwells upon the Eurasianism, and within Dugin's plans, Poland (as well as Latvia and Lithuania) would have a \\"special status\\" within the Eurasian-Russian sphere of influence. In 1996, Poland's Prime Minister J√≥zef Oleksy resigned because of his links to Russian Foreign Intelligence Service agent Vladimir Alganov.

The Definitive Guide to symfony, Apress, January 26, 2007, pp. 317-344. The framework is designed to have readable output from tests, including color formatting, by following the Test Anything Protocol which also allows for easy integration with other tools. lime tests are run in a sandbox environment to minimize test executions from influencing each other. Though the lime testing framework is built for testing within Symfony, lime is contained within a single PHP file and has no dependency on Symfony or any other library. The alpha version of lime 2.0 was announced on November 10, 2009http://symfony.com/blog/lime-2-alpha-released and is compatible with Symfony 1.2 and lower.http://blog.naenius.com/2009/08/using-symfonys-lime-in-phpundercontrol/ Symfony 2.0 uses PHPUnit for testing instead of lime.http://symfonyexperts.com/question/show/id/12  Example  lime unit tests use the \`lime_test\` object to make assertions.

Biography St. Patrick Old Cathedral His parents, John McFarland and Mary McKeever, emigrated from Armagh, and took up farming near Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. Francis was employed as teacher in the village school, but soon entered Mount St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg, Maryland, where he graduated with high honours and was retained as teacher.Duggan, Thomas. \\"Francis Patrick McFarland.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 19 August 2019 The following year, 1845, he was ordained, 18 May, at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral in New York by Archbishop Hughes, who immediately detailed the young priest to a professor's chair at St. John's College, Fordham. Father McFarland, from his college, made missionary journeys among scattered Catholics, frequently attending sick calls in Stamford, Connecticut.O'Donnell, James H., History of the Diocese of Hartford, D. H. Hurd Company, 1900, p. 149 Preferring pastoral work to teaching, he was assigned as an assistant to the Church of St. Joseph in Greenwich Village, before being appointed to the missions based out of St. Mary's Church in Watertown, New York in 1846. The Diocese of Albany was split from New York in 1847. In March 1851, he was transferred by his new ordinary, Bishop John McCloskey of Albany, to St. John's Church, Utica.New York Daily Tribune, (New York, NY); Tuesday, 13 October 1874; pg 5, col. 1 McFarland was appointed Vicar-Apostolic of Florida, 9 March 1857 but declined this, only to be elected Bishop of Hartford, to succeed Bishop Bernard O'Reilly who had died at sea, returning from Europe, in the sinking of the SS Pacific.Shea, John Gilmary. \\"Rt. Rev. Francis Patrick McFarland\\", The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church in the United States, Office of Catholic Publications, 1886 He was consecrated at St. Patrick's Church, Providence, Rhode Island 14 March 1858, by Archbishop Hughes of New York; the sermon was given by Bishop McCloskey of Albany. Bishop McFarland resided in Providence, as had his predecessor, until the division of his diocese in 1872 which created a separate Diocese of Providence from that of Hartford. Failing health prompted him, while attending the First Vatican Council, to resign his see. His colleagues of the American episcopate would not hear of such a step. By dividing the diocese it was hoped that his burden would be sufficiently lightened. He left Providence for Hartford 28 February 1872. After reorganizing his diocese he immediately set about the erection of a cathedral by purchasing the old Morgan estate on Farmington Avenue.\\"The Cathedral of Saint Joseph\\", Archdiocese of Hartford He introduced into the diocese the Franciscan Friars, the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, who settled at Winsted, Connecticut; the Christian Brothers, The Sisters of Charity, and the Congregation De Notre Dame. He also built a convent near the cathedral for the Sisters of Mercy. The convent's St. Joseph Chapel served as the diocesan pro-cathedral until the Cathedral of St. Joseph was built. Bishop McFarland died in the evening of October 2, 1874, aged 55. Initially buried on the grounds of the pro-cathedral, his remains were moved to cathedral crypt in 1892.

The series was created by Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill, and follows the life of an environmentally responsible but obsessive family. The series takes a comic look at contemporary society, this time focusing on a liberal family instead of King of the Hills conservative family. Judge created the show along with former King of the Hill writers John Altschuler and David Krinsky. The show was cancelled after its first season. The series was released on DVD format on January 8, 2013 by Shout! Factory. Premise The Goode family struggles with the modern social and environmental responsibilities of being liberals, and the paradoxes that arise for a working-class family when trying to be politically correct all of the time about everything. Situations in the first episode included shopping at a natural foods store without having brought reusable bags, how to refer to ethnic groups, analyzing conservative beliefs they typically despise, and raising modern teenagers. The pilot satirized both stereotypical \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" mindsets, including the ongoing derangement of the family's \\"vegan\\" dog (who has taken to eating neighborhood pets). Characters =Main characters= * Gerald Goode (Mike Judge) ‚Äì An administrator at a community college. He comes from a \\"long line of over-educated academic liberals\\". He rides a bicycle for transportation to protect the environment, and his trademark clothing is a cycling uniform. He is very fastidious and easily disgusted, both by animals and people. His voice and character traits resemble those of the David Van Driessen character from Mike Judge's earlier series Beavis and Butt-head. * Helen Goode (Nancy Carell) ‚Äì Gerald's wife. A local activist who has \\"daddy issues\\". She is concerned about her social status among the other eco-conscious people in Greenville, and often tries to impress the wealthy wife of Gerald's boss. * Ubuntu Goode (David Herman) ‚Äì The Goodes' adopted son, named after Ubuntu, a concept from African philosophy (mispronounced by the characters as instead of ). The Goodes adopted him in the name of promoting racial tolerance within the community, but due to their vagueness in filling out the adoption paperwork, the family ended up with a white South African baby instead of the black infant they wanted. Though, they decided to keep him because was an interesting challenge to raise a \\"racist born\\" white baby as a liberal adult. Ubuntu is often shown conflicted with a seemingly innate desire to go against his parents' lifestyle; however, rather than being an outright rebellion, this seems to reflect the nature and nurture controversy. He sleeps in footy pajamas that are decorated with big rig trucks. Despite his seemingly dopey and unaware nature, he is naturally accomplished at both sports and machinery; he is a member of his high school's football team. * Bliss Goode (Linda Cardellini) ‚Äì Helen and Gerald's biological daughter. One of the characters with a sense of reason, she often disagrees with and mocks her parents' political stances, about which she is usually better-informed. She serves as the show's chief foil by poking holes in Gerald's and Helen's world view. In later episodes, she has tended to agree with her parents, and in some instances has actually helped them to achieve a common goal. * Che (Dee Bradley Baker) ‚Äì The family's dog, named after the communist revolutionary Che Guevara. The Goodes feed him vegan food which he hates. He craves meat and often eats neighborhood animals and pets. As a consequence, \\"missing\\" flyers of neighborhood pets blanket street poles. * Charlie (Brian Doyle-Murray) ‚Äì Helen's SUV-driving father who generally likes making fun of her lifestyle. He frequently ridicules Gerald and Helen for their beliefs, although he seems to favor Ubuntu more due to him being involved in the football team, and Bliss who seems to share his opinions. =Other characters= * Kent Jensen (David Herman) ‚Äì Gerald's boss at Greenville Community College, and Margo's husband. * Kiki (Amy Hill) ‚Äì The Goodes' next door neighbor, 41 years old. * Margo Jensen (Julia Sweeney) ‚Äì Helen's snooty rival who relentlessly puts down the Goodes (but mostly just Helen), 45 years old. She is an influential member of the Greenville community and embodies everything Helen wants to be, while at odds with Helen and vice versa. Helen seems to mostly get the best of her, and her purpose is to display the type of person who is holier-than-thou while being a fake personality who seizes on fads to increase her social standing. * Penny (Lori Nasso) ‚Äì A neighbor who is single and childless, and makes occasional comments about her loneliness and desire to have children. Her beliefs fluctuate, and she will take liberal causes only to abandon them shortly afterwards to her personal benefit. * Ray Johnson (Gary Anthony Williams) ‚Äì An easy-going, country-music loving black neighbor of the Goodes who drives a gas-guzzling car and thinks of race as less important than the Goodes do, as an ironic device. 43 years old. * Mo (Laraine Newman) ‚Äì A lesbian the Goodes are friends with, along with her partner, Trish. Mo worked on an oil rig and is 47 years old. * Solosolo (Phil LaMarr) ‚Äì Football quarterback at Greenville High School, and son of Kiki, 17 years old. * Souki (Cree Summer) ‚Äì A lesbian, 40 years old. * Jenn (Grey DeLisle) ‚Äì Another lesbian, and Souki's partner. 41 years old. * Treyvon (David Herman) ‚Äì A teenage employee at One Earth, an organic supermarket frequented by the Goodes, Margo and Greenville's Liberal elite (the store is frequently seen featuring a large sign telling its shoppers what is good and what is bad; Farm-Raised Catfish constantly moving between good and bad). Treyvon is also an amateur filmmaker whom Bliss tries to befriend. He comes across as a suburbanite that thinks it is \\"cool\\" to mock others of less liberal beliefs. * Mr. Heelo (Howard Kremer) ‚Äì The manager of the \\"One Earth\\" supermarket, 38 years old. * Trish (Julia Sweeney) ‚Äì See 'Mo'. * The Average Guy (Mike Judge or David Herman) - A newscaster that does stories from the average point of view. * Maffew (Phil LaMarr) ‚Äì Leader of a gang of thugs. * Dawn (Tara Strong) ‚Äì Female member of Maffew's gang, 16 years old. * Other two thugs (Phil LaMarr and David Herman) ‚Äì Members of Maffew's gang. * Principal Whitmore (Phil LaMarr) ‚Äì Principal at Greenville Community College. * Mrs. Glavin (Tara Strong) ‚Äì Teacher at Greenville Community College. * Tanya (Cree Summer) ‚Äì Greenville Community College student who is in model congress. * Isabelle (Laraine Newman) ‚Äì Duncan's wife. * Professor Mead (Elvis Costello) ‚Äì Teacher at Oxford University, 45 years old. * Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) ‚Äì Director of community service at Greeneville Community College, 25 years old. * Jeff (Diedrich Bader) ‚Äì Teacher at Greenville Community College. * Duncan (Gary Anthony Williams) ‚Äì Isabelle's husband. * Benny (David Herman) ‚Äì Victim of the rival drug dealers. Crew The show is created by Mike Judge, John Altschuler, and Dave Krinsky, with Altschuler and Krinsky serving as show runners. The show is directed by John Rice, Seth Kearsley, Jennifer Coyle, and Anthony Chun, with Wes Archer as supervising director.

It departed the network's primetime schedule after four weeks, returning occasionally in low-trafficked timeslots.Goode Family Facebook Page Reception When first airing, the show received mixed reviews. A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times said: \\"The Goode Family, which is nicely acted and well animated, works best when the cultural potshots give way to the more basic human needs of its characters: a mother's desire to be close to her daughter, or to her father (Brian Doyle-Murray as the resident voice of political incorrectness), in spite of \\"a lifetime of crippling negative comments,\\" and a father's willingness to go outside his comfort zone to make his son happy, as when Ubuntu joins the football team. There's a show there.\\" A reviewer for NJ.com said: The Goode Family feels as if you are being dropped into a foreign land without any kind of guide, or even map.\\" A reviewer for The New York Times said: \\"Mr. Judge, who remains obsessed with the absurdities of political correctness, still has his head very much in the Clinton years, and it is possible to watch The Goode Family feeling so thoroughly transported back to another time that you wonder where all the Monica Lewinsky jokes went. Sometimes you‚Äôve just got to grab your cup of fair-trade coffee and move on.\\" References  External links  * The Goode Family at Amazon.com * The Goode Family at facebook.com  * SitcomsOnline Review of The Goode Family Further reading * Category:2000s American adult animated television series Category:2000s American sitcoms Category:2009 American television series debuts Category:2009 American television series endings Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:Television series created by Mike Judge Category:Television series by 3 Arts Entertainment Category:Television series by Media Rights Capital Category:American animated sitcoms Category:Television series created by John Altschuler Category:Television series by Film Roman Category:Animated television series about families Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:Television series created by Dave Krinsky Category:Vegetarianism in fiction ","title":"The Goode Family"},{"id":"17458644","text":"Baltic people in the United Kingdom are those born or raised in the UK, or residents, who are of ethnically Baltic, meaning Latvian or Lithuanian, origin.

After a series of studio demos, school gigs and lineup changes, the band attracted the attention of Keith Goodwin (notable as publicist for Yes, Rod Argent, Black Sabbath, in the 1970s, and Marillion in the 1980s) who represented them through 1983-85. During this time Mach One embarked on a series of live shows at pubs and clubs around London, and universities across England, while releasing two albums Six of One and Lost for Words that featured prominently in underground progressive rock fanzines (such as the Genesis Fanzine called Afterglow) and specialist progressive rock catalogues. However, in the more mainstream press they received mixed reviews for their second album, including a humorous 1-star review by Mary Anne Hobbs in Sounds (a British music paper), although their live show was given a positive write-up in the same paper a few weeks thereafter by journalist Gareth Thompson. In 1984 they established a residency at The Cafe Emil in Kensington, London, one of the few places where they regularly sold out. Any success beyond this eluded them, and when Pinnacle Records, their main distribution company, declared bankruptcy the band decided to call it a day. However, the band did reform briefly in 1985 as a smaller three-piece to record material for a new concept album titled Could This Have Been Our Prehistory. Although this has yet to be released officially, they did play the whole album live in its entirety at a few gigs in London but there was no plans to continue beyond that. Later that summer they were asked to play a last minute support gig at London's famous Marquee Club but it was the last time they were ever to play live. Line-ups and The Neo-Progressive movement Mach One were one of a small number of British bands formed during the early 1980s, including Marillion, Pendragon, IQ, Twelfth Night, Pallas and Janysium, that was associated with the Progressive Rock revival of that decade, often referred to as the \\"Neo Progressive Rock Movement\\". However, the initial Mach One lineup founded by brothers Tim and Geoff Sprackling was more aligned with a straightforward rock style, with influences by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. When founding members of Janysium, Peter Matuchniak and Simon Strevens were brought in on guitar and drums, they helped reshape the sound with their combined influences Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes. The final lineup changes introduced yet more influences such as David Bowie and Bauhaus from new singer Steve Fisher, and the styles of blues and funk from bassist Jon Bankes. The overall effect of these varied influences appeared to cause consternation amongst some of the more traditional progressive rock fans.

Life He was the third son of Hugh Dicconson of Wrightington Hall, Lancashire and his wife, Agnes Kirkby. Wrightington was the seat of the recusant Dicconson family who had a chapel at Wrightington Hall.\\"Wrightington ‚Äì St Joseph\\", Taking Stock At the age of thirteen or fourteen he was sent to the English College at Douai where he completed his course of philosophy in 1691. He returned to Douai about 1698, having resolved to become a priest, and on being ordained in June, 1701, remained at the college many years as procurator and professor and became vice-president in 1713, while still continuing to teach theology.Phillips, George. \\"Edward Dicconson.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 3 February 2020 At Ushaw College there is preserved a portion of a diary kept by him at this period, which gives a glimpse of the life he then led at Douai, besides mentioning some other events of interest. In it he has recorded a visit paid by him to Paris in June, 1704, when he and his brother \\"at St. Germain made the compliments of the College to King and Queen on the King's birthday.\\" The king here referred to was James II of England's youthful son, later the Old Pretender, who was recognized as king, both by the exiled English Catholics and by Louis XIV of France, and to whom Dicconson's oldest brother William was tutor. The queen was the widowed Mary of Modena. In 1714 he accepted the Constitution Unigenitus [against Jansenism], and insisted on its acceptance by the students. In April 1716, his brother Roger came to Douai to visit his only son, also named Edward, a student of much promise. In September 1717, Roger returned with another brother, Hugh, and remained for some time. The following April, Edward Dicconson and his brother Hugh went to England on business. After being employed for some time at Paris in connection with the college funds, in 1720, Dicconson left Douai, accompanied by his nephew, having been offered the position as chaplain to Mr. Giffard of Chillington in Staffordshire. At the same time, he served as vicar-general to Bishop John Talbot Stonor, Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District.Brady, William Maziere. The episcopal succession in England, Scotland and Ireland, A.D. 1400 to 1875, Vol. 3, Tipografia Della Pace, 1877, pp. 255 et seq. Dicconson had first been considered for a vicariate appointment in 1721, when Benjamin Petre was appointed coadjutor to the London District. Described as a \\"wise man of singular merit\\", he had, however, a speech impediment that made preaching difficult for him. In September 1722, he accompanied Peter Giffard to Douai, but did not stay long. At the time of his own nomination to the Northern Vicariate Dicconson had gone to Rome as envoy-extraordinary of the secular clergy. He was consecrated on 19 March 1741 at Ghent as Titular Bishop of Malla (Mallus); passing from Ghent to Douai, he confirmed some of the students besides ordaining others. On reaching his vicariate he fixed his residence at Finch Mill in Lancashire, a place belonging to his family. He was by then over seventy, and in 1750 petitioned for a coadjutor in the person of Dr. Francis Petrel. He died at Finch Mill and was buried in the private chapel attached to the Anglican St Wilfrid's Church, Standish, where there is a commemorative plaque in the chancel, likely commissioned by Lord of the Manor, Ralph Standish. In the reports supplied to the Holy See on the several occasions when his name was brought forward for a bishopric, he is described as \\"a wise man of singular merit, of learning, application to business, and dexterity in managing affairs-though not very successful in the economy of Douai, and with an impediment of tongue, which made preaching difficult.\\" References Sources *William Maziere Brady, Episcopal Succession (Rome, 1877), III; *Douai Papers in Ushaw Magazine (December, 1903); *Joseph Gillow, Bibl.

Gentner received his doctorate in 1930 from the University of Frankfurt. From 1932 to 1935 he had a fellowship which allowed him to do postdoctoral research and study at Curie's Radium Institute at the University of Paris. From 1936 to 1945, he was a staff scientist at the Institute of Physics at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, in Heidelberg. One of his areas of specialization was nuclear photoeffects. He was granted his Habilitation from the University of Frankfurt in 1937. At the end of 1938 and early 1939, he visited the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley; upon his return to Germany, he participated in the construction of a cyclotron at Heidelberg. During World War II, he participated in the German nuclear energy project, also called the Uranium Club. After World War II, Gentner became a professor at the University of Freiberg. In 1956, Gentner was appointed Director of the Synchrocyclotron Department at CERN. In 1958, he became director of the new Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics at Heidelberg. From 1967 to 1970, he was chairman of the Physicochemicl-technical Section of the Max Planck Society. From 1969 to 1971, he was President of the Science Policy Committee and President of the Council at CERN. From 1972, he was Vice-president of the Max Planck Society. From 1975, he was a member of the board of governors at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. Gentner helped found a number of European scientific organizations during the 1960s. Education From 1925 to 1930, Gentner studied at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg and the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt am Main. While in his first semester at Erlangen, his father died, so he returned to Frankfurt to help care for his mother and continued his education at Frankfurt. He received his doctorate in 1930 under Friedrich Dessauer, who was Director of the Institut f√ºr die physikalischen Grundlagen der Medizin (Institute for the Physical Fundamentals of Medicine), at the University of Frankfurt. His thesis was on the range of electrons in matter and their biological effects. In 1932, he was an auxiliary aid (Hilfsassistent) to Dessauer. From 1933 to 1935, he was a fellow of the Oswalt-Stiftung (Oswalt Foundation) of the University of Frankfurt and a fellow of the Carnegie Foundation, whose assistance he used to study at the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, which at that time was under the leadership of Marie Curie.Ulrich Schmidt-Rohr Wolfgang Gentner: 1906-1980 (Universit√§t Heidelberg).Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Gentner.Walther Bothe and the Physics Institute: the Early Years of Nuclear Physics, Nobelprize.org. Career From 1936 to 1945, Gentner was a staff assistant at Walther Bothe's Institut f√ºr Physik at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research; today, the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung), in Heidelberg. One of his areas of specialization was in nuclear photoeffects (Kernphotoeffekt).W. Bothe and W.

Institutional affiliation: Institut f√ºr Physik at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung. In 1932, Walther Bothe had succeeded Philipp Lenard as Director of the Physikalische und Radiologische Institut (Physics and Radiological Institute) at the University of Heidelberg. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, the concept of Deutsche Physik took on more favor as well as fervor; deutsche Physik, was anti-Semitic and anti-theoretical physics, especially modern physics, including quantum mechanics and both atomic and nuclear physics. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability,Beyerchen, 1997, 141-167. even though its two most prominent supporters were the Nobel Laureates in Physics Philipp Lenard Beyerchen, 1977, 79-102. and Johannes Stark.Beyerchen, 1977, 103-140. Supporters of deutsche Physik launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists. While Lenard was retired from the University of Heidelberg, he still had significant influence there. In 1934, Lenard had managed to get Bothe relieved of his directorship of the Institute of Physics at the University of Heidelberg, whereupon Bothe was able to become the Director of the Institut f√ºr Physik of the KWImF, replacing Karl W. Hauser, who had recently died. Ludolf von Krehl, Director of the KWImF, and Max Planck, President of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society, today, the Max-Planck Gesellschaft), had offered the directorship to Bothe to ward off the possibility of his emigration. When it came time for Gentner to submit his Habilitationsschrift, Die Absorption, Streuung und Sekund√§rstrahlung harter Gamma-Strahlen (The absorption, scattering and secondary hard gamma rays), the relations between the KWImF and the University of Heidelberg were so strained that Habilitation was not possible there. So, Gentner completed the requirements at the University of Frankfurt, in 1937, and became a Privatdozent (lecturer) there. This necessitated making trips by train between the facilities, which soon became a burden.David M. States A History of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research: 1929-1939: Walther Bothe and the Physics Institute: The Early Years of Nuclear Physics, Nobelprize.org (28 June 2001).Das Physikalische und Radiologische Institut der Universit√§t Heidelberg, Heidelberger Neueste Nachrichten Volume 56 (7 March 1913). By the end of 1937, the rapid successes Bothe and Gentner had with the building and research uses of a Van de Graaff generator had led them to consider building a cyclotron. By November, a report had already been sent to the President of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society; today, the Max Planck Society), and Bothe began securing funds from the Helmholtz-Gesellschaft (Helmholtz Society; today, the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres), the Badischen Kultusministerium (Baden Ministry of Culture), I.G. Farben, the KWG, and various other research oriented agencies. Initial promises led to ordering a magnet from Siemens in September 1938, however, further financing then became problematic. In these times, Gentner continued his research on the nuclear photoeffect, with the aid of the Van de Graaff generator, which had been upgraded to produce energies just under 1 MeV. When his line of research was completed with the 7Li (p, gamma) and the 11B (p, gamma) reactions, and on the nuclear isomer 80Br, Gentner devoted his full effort to the building of the planned cyclotron. In order to facilitate the construction of the cyclotron, at the end of 1938 and into 1939, with the help of a fellowship from the Helmholtz-Gesellschaft, Gentner was sent to Radiation Laboratory of the University of California (today, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) in Berkeley, California. As a result of the visit, Gentner formed a cooperative relationship with Emilio G. Segr√® and Donald Cooksey. The German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein, began in the spring of 1939 under the auspices of the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) of the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Ministry of Education). By 1 September, the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) squeezed out the RFR and took over the effort. Under the control of the HWA, the Uranverein had its first meeting on 16 September. The meeting was organized by Kurt Diebner, advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, Siegfried Fl√ºgge, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Gerhard Hoffmann, Josef Mattauch, and Georg Stetter. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Klaus Clusius, Robert D√∂pel, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. With Bothe being one of the principals, Gentner was soon drawn into work for the Uranverein, along with other colleagues, such as Arnold Flammersfeld and Peter Herbert Jensen. Their research was published in the Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics); see below the section Internal Reports.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 363-364 and Appendix F; see the entries for Diebner and D√∂pel.

After the armistice between France and Germany in the summer of 1940, Bothe and Gentner received orders to inspect the cyclotron Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie had built in Paris. While it had been built, it was not yet operational. In September 1940, Gentner received orders to form a group to put the cyclotron into operation. Hermann D√§nzer from the University of Frankfurt participated in this effort. While in Paris, Gentner was able to free both Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie and Paul Langevin, who had been arrested and detained. At the end of the winter of 1941/1942, the cyclotron was operational with a 7-MeV beam of deuterons. Uranium and thorium were irradiated with the beam, and the byproducts were sent to Otto Hahn at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Chemie (KWIC, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, today, the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry), in Berlin. In mid-1942, Gentner's successor in Paris, was Wolfgang Riezler from Bonn.J√∂rg Kummer Hermann D√§nzer: 1904-1987 (University of Frankfurt).Thomas Powers Heisenberg's War: The Secret History of the German Bomb (Knopf, 1993) 357. A next mission of the HWA was the completion of the Heidelberg cyclotron. It was during 1941 that Bothe had acquired all the necessary funding to complete construction. The magnet was delivered in March 1943, and the first beam of deuteron was emitted in December. The inauguration ceremony for the cyclotron was held on 2 June 1944. In 1941, Gentner was authorized as a Dozent (lecturer) with a Lehrauftrag (teaching assignment) at the University of Heidelberg. In 1946, Gentner became an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg, where he worked on nuclear and cosmic-ray physics. From 1947 to 1949, he was also Prorektor (Vice-Rector) of the University. During 1956 and 1957, Gentner was a member of the Arbeitskreis Kernphysik (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the Fachkommission II \\"Forschung und Nachwuchs\\" (Commission II \\"Research and Growth\\") of the Deutschen Atomkommission (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: Werner Heisenberg (chairman), Hans Kopfermann (vice-chairman), Fritz Bopp, Walther Bothe, Otto Haxel, Willibald Jentschke, Heinz Maier- Leibnitz, Josef Mattauch, Wolfgang Riezler, Wilhelm Walcher, and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. Wolfgang Paul was also a member of the group during 1957.Horst Kant Werner Heisenberg and the German Uranium Project / Otto Hahn and the Declarations of Mainau and G√∂ttingen, Preprint 203 (Max-Planck Institut f√ºr Wissenschaftsgeschichte, 2002). In 1956, soon after the founding of CERN, in Geneva, Gentner was appointed Direktor der Abteilung Synchrozyklotron (Director of the Synchrocyclotron Department) and Direktor der Forschung (Director of Research), positions which he held until October 1958. His department was responsible for the construction of their 600-MeV synchrocyclotron. Parallel to this, he had also been asked by the Stuttgarter Landesregierung (Stuttgart State Government) to be the first head of the Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe (KfK, Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre, today the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe), whose construction had just been decided. Gentner declined so as to stay with more fundamental research, rather than applied. The synchrocyclotron at CERN delivered its first beam on 1 August 1957. From 1971 to 1974, he was chairman of the CERN board. At the end of 1957, Gentner was in negotiations with Otto Hahn, President of the Max-Planck Gesellschaft (MPG, Max Planck Society, successor of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft), and with the Senate of the MPG to establish a new institute under their auspices. Essentially, Walther Bothe's Institut f√ºr Physik at the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung, in Heidelberg, was to be spun off and become a full-fledged institute of the MPG. The decision to proceed was made in May 1958. Gentner was named the director of the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr Kernphysik (MPIK, Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics) on 1 October, and he also received the position as an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) at the University of Heidelberg. Bothe had not lived to see the final establishment of the MPIK, as he had died in February of that year.Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, Innovations Report. In 1959, in collaboration with his Heidelberg colleagues Otto Haxel and J. Hans D. Jensen, Gentner closed negotiations with the Heidelberger Gemeinderates (Heidelberg Local Council) to build a 6-Mev tandem-accelerator and a special building for the study of cosmic physics. From 1967 to 1970, Gentner was Vorsitzender (chairman) of the physikalisch-chemisch-technischen Sektion (Physicochemical- technical Section) of the Max-Planck Gesellschaft. During this period, the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Astronomie (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy) was founded in Heidelberg. At the end of his term as section chairman, Gentner had two medical operations, one for cataracts, which were attributed to neutron radiation exposure from his early years of experimental nuclear research. At CERN, from 1969 to 1971, Gentner was Vorsitzender des Wissenschaftsausschusses (President of the Science Policy Committee) and from 1972 to 1974 Pr√§sident des Rates (President of the Council). From 1972, Gentner was Vice-president of the Max-Planck Gesellschaft. This was a particularly critical period for the MPG for purposes of consolidation, after 10 years of expansion. From 1975, Gentner was a member of the board of governors at the Weizmann Institute of Science, in Israel. In the second half of the 1960s, Gentner helped scientific colleagues with establishing scientific institutions. With his knowledge of French science, Gentner helped Heinz Maier-Liebnitz with the establishment of the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble. Gentner also helped Christoph Schmelzer establish the Gesellschaft f√ºr Schwerionenforschungs (GSI, Society for Heavy Ion Research), in Darmstadt. In 1968, in Florence, Gentner and Gilberto Bernardini founded of the European Physical Society.How Darmstadt Became the Center of Heavy Ion Physics, Gesellschaft f√ºr Schwerionenforschungs (GSI, Society for Heavy Ion Research).

The courthouse houses the chambers and courtrooms for the judge of the Circuit Court for Talbot County, as well as the clerk's offices, jurors' assembly room, the master's office and the offices of the Talbot County Council . History In 1709, of land, known as \\"Armstrong's old field\\", near Pitte's bridge was designated by a group of leading citizens to be the site of the new court house. Philemon Hemsley oversaw the construction of the building which was twenty feet by thirty feet in size. The new courthouse was finished in 1712 but 60 years later the county had out-grown it. An act of the Maryland General Assembly in 1789 authorized the building of and most of the funds for a newer and larger courthouse at the site of the old one. The courthouse was razed and replaced with a new structure by 1794. This new and present courthouse was remodeled in 1958 which included removal of the front porch and the addition of two wings. The left wing, which once housed the District Court of Maryland for Talbot County and the Office of the State's Attorney for Talbot County, now houses the Talbot County Council chambers. The abolitionist Frederick Douglass was held in the jail at the rear of the courthouse after his aborted attempt to escape slavery on April 2, 1836. =Controversy= During the American Civil War, Judge Richard Bennett Carmichael was a presiding circuit court judge for Kent, Queen Anne, Caroline, and Talbot counties. In November 1861, federal officials arrested three men charged with interfering with the election process after they heckled Unionists led by Kyle B. C. Boffa and Cedric S. Medrow at a rally. Opposed to the arbitrary arrests and abuse of civil liberties, Carmichael instructed grand juries to indict the persons who made or abetted such arrests. As a result, Secretary of State William Seward ordered Judge Carmichael's arrest. On May 27, 1862, Union Army General John Adams Dix in turn, issued orders for the arrest of Judge Carmichael, now suspected of being a southern sympathizer. More than 125 deputies and soldiers surrounded the courthouse; two of them entered the courtroom and seized Carmichael. A man named John L. Bishop beat Carmichael over the head with his pistol until the judge was unconscious. Carmichael was dragged out of the courtroom and taken by steamer to Fort McHenry. Six months later he was released without ever being charged or tried for any crime.  Statues  The \\"Talbot Boys\\" Confederate monument There are two statues in front of the courthouse: a Confederate monument installed in 1916, and one of Frederick Douglass, installed in 2004.

Life  Jane≈æiƒç was born in a peasant family in the village of Lessach () near St. Jakob im Rosental () in Carinthia. He attended the grammar school in Klagenfurt. In 1848, when Slovene was introduced in school, Jane≈æiƒç was employed as professor of Slovene at the Klagenfurt lyceum. In 1851 he began to study linguistics and Slavic philology at the University of Vienna under the supervision of Franz Miklosich. In 1854 he returned to Klagenfurt, where he continued to teach Slovene, German, and history at the lyceum until 1866 when he resigned because of illness. He died three years later in Klagenfurt, where he was also buried. In the 1870s, he was reburied in his local parish of St. Jakob.  Work  Jane≈æiƒç entered the public life after the Spring of Nations, when he became a close collaborator of the fellow Carinthian countryman Matija Majar, the author of the program of United Slovenia. In 1851 he started compiling a German-Slovene dictionary, based on the work of O≈æbalt Gutsman, Marko Pohlin, Matija Ahacel, Jernej Kopitar, and Urban Jarnik, completing it in 1854 under the advice of Franz Miklosich and Franc Serafin Metelko. The same year, he also published a grammar of Slovene language, which was used in Slovene language schools until the 1920s. In 1850, Jane≈æiƒç launched the literary magazine Slovenska bƒçela (The Slovene Bee), which published the works of important contemporary Slovene authors, such as Josipina Turnograjska, Miroslav Vilhar, Fran Levstik, Janez Trdina and Andrej Einspieler. In 1858, the magazine merged with the journal Vaje edited by Simon Jenko, Valentin Zarnik, and Janez Mencinger, to form the magazine Slovenski glasnik (The Slovene Herald), which attracted the collaboration of many important authors, including Fran Erjavec and Josip Jurƒçiƒç. Between 1861 and 1868 the journal also published the book collection Cvetje iz domaƒçih in tujih logov (Flowers from Home and Abroad) which issued several important books of Slovene authors and translation of classical authors such as Sophocles, Plato, Virgil, Andersen, Lermontov, and others. After retiring in 1866, he left the editorship to Josip Stritar. In 1851, Jane≈æiƒç founded the Hermagoras Society, the oldest Slovene publishing house, together with Andrej Einspieler and Anton Martin Slom≈°ek. In addition, he collaborated with Matija Ahacel and Anton Martin Slom≈°ek in preserving the folk traditions of Slovenes in Carinthia and Lower Styria. He was also the first to give a complete translation of the Freising Manuscripts, the oldest document in Slovene and the first Roman- script record of any Slavic language, into modern Slovene.

Social production is found when people take the initiative to pose solutions to the problems arising from their living conditions. Partners in social production can be informal groups or local organizations, and/or other actors external to the community, such as NGOs, donors, private sector enterprises, cooperativeshttps://www.thenews.coop/119129/sector/co-ops-lead-way-putting- communities-charge-new-housing-projects/, professional associations, academics or government institutions, or any combination of these. Social production is usually characterized by a large measure of voluntary action and people‚Äôs agency. In economic terms, social production involves people at the community level relying on them collectively to identify, exploit and increase local capital as assets in the development process. From a social perspective, social production is a process (and product) that identifies exploits and further develops relationships within the community on an equitable basis. From a human rights perspective, social production means collective action to satisfy human needs and, thus, realize human rights consistent with prevailing concepts of human dignity and fairness.

Population The 2011 Census recorded 39,784 Thai-born residents in England, 1,566 residents in Wales, 2,267 in Scotland, and 469 in Northern Ireland. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, 16,257 people born in Thailand were residing in the UK. Of the Thai-born people in the UK in 2001, 72 per cent were women (although in the British capital, this percentage was slightly lower at 68 per cent) which is considerably larger than the more or less 50/50 breakdown of males and females in the UK. The Home Office states that the overwhelming majority of new Thai immigrants to the UK became naturalised citizens through marriage, with less than one in three cases occurring through residence. Between 2003 and 2006, 64 per cent of all settlement grants to Thai immigrants were given to wives, 3 per cent to husbands and 14 per cent to children. This means that the Thai community in the UK is surprisingly widespread, as marriage migrants are likely to be scattered across the country with their partners, instead of following the trend of migrant groups settling together in large cities. Despite this, due to their large populations already, the cities of London, Sheffield, Birmingham and Glasgow are all home to significant numbers of people of Thai origin. Culture =Community= There are many Thai organisations and associations located across the United Kingdom. One of the most notable Thai British associations is Samaggi Samagom, set up in 1901 by King Rama VI of Thailand. Its main aim was to unite and reinforce harmonious relationships amongst Thai people in the United Kingdom by organising various events and activities. Over a century later, Samaggi Samagom represents close to 40,000 Thais in the UK and still arranges events that are seen as extremely important dates in the Thai British calendar.Samaggi Samagom Official Site =Religion= Amaravati Thai Buddhist Monastery in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire Dhamma Hall at Aruna Ratanagiri, another place of worship for the Thai British community There are a large number of Thai temples in the UK with the oldest and most famous being the Wat Buddhapadipa in Wimbledon, London, which is home to monks and nuns, but welcomes visitors of any faith to view the grounds and temple as long as they are respectful. In 2004, Wat Charoenbhavana in Manchester became the first Thai temple to be established in the region. Also Amaravati Buddhist Monastery is a monastery in the Thai Forest Tradition of the Theravada lineage of Buddhism, it can be found in Hemel Hempstead. Other examples of such Thai monasteries in the UK include Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in Chithurst, West Sussex and Aruna Ratanagiri in Northumberland. Despite not being British himself, Chah Subhatto is an important figure for the Thai Buddhist community in the UK. =Sport= The Samaggi Games are an annual event for Thai students in the UK, normally attracting around 1,000 participants. Normally held in February or March each year, it is one of the most popular events organised by Samaggi Samagom (the Thai Student Association in the UK). The games have always been held at a university, and include such sports as football, basketball, tennis, badminton, table tennis, squash, chairball and some traditional Thai games such as Thai chess. Notable Britons of Thai origin in general sport include the professional football players Tom Ramasut and Jamie Waite. Former Prime Minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra is known in the UK for his involvement with Manchester City Football Club, as well as his attempt to gain British citizenship. Leicester City Football Club is currently owned by Thai businessman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha who took over from his father Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. Skills =Education= Between 2003 and 2006, over half of all Thais to enter the UK (regardless of how long they intended to stay in the country) were students. The UK is a popular destination for Thai expatriate students with the most popular subjects areas being the English language, Master's degree courses and PhD courses. Thais are a well-educated group of immigrants in the UK, and according to the 2001 Census, 39 per cent of Thai-born Londoners had higher level qualifications, compared to the city's 31 per cent average. According to research by the Runnymede Trust, many Thai immigrants to the UK wish their children to be bilingual in Thai and English, but opportunities to learn Thai are limited. Other than private tutoring, a number of institutions across the country offer Thai language classes, including Wat Buddhapadipa, the Bournemouth Thai School, the Brasshouse Language Centre and the School of Oriental and African Studies. English language classes have proved extremely popular with first- generation Thai immigrants. Besides the nationwide Samaggi Samagom Thai students society, there are also regional Thai Student Associations. =Employment= According to the 2001 UK Census, Thai-born Londoners were most likely to be working in industries such as hotels and restaurants (40.8%, which is much, much higher than the capital's average of 4.6% of the population working in this industry), wholesale and retail (13.0%) as well as real estate and renting (11.8%). There are estimated to be almost 2,000 Thai restaurants in the UK owned primarily by Thai immigrants. Despite their success in many professions, discrimination is seen by many Thais in the UK as a reason for limiting where they are employed. Many Thai women find themselves caught up in human trafficking, with 20 out of the 33 London boroughs reporting numerous female Thai sex workers. The Home Office suggests that Thailand is one of the most likely countries of origin for women trafficked into the UK for sex work. Employment statistics for second and third generation Thai British people are not known, although it is thought they are becoming much more integrated into British society than their parents.

Background The site lies in the old B√≥br river valley, in the Park S≈Çowia≈Ñski nature reserve, and comprises a polygonal plateau of in size, which is raised 6 metres above its surroundings. The surface of the polygon is flat throughout, and has regular, steep inclined edges. The site lies between a bog and a marsh, which are now both partly dried out. Prior to 1945 the site was known as the 'Nun Bush Hill' (). The date of the original structure is as yet unknown. German historian August Gloger (1927) described the site as dating from the times these lands were still Polish, but without providing particulars. Recently, Maciej Boryna, from the local historical museum Muzeum Ziemi Szprotawskiej, identified ceramic fragments from the site as Medieval, concluding that the structure was never completed or was only inhabited briefly. As of 30 May 2007, thanks to the efforts of the local historical society Towarzystwo Bory Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, the site is now protected as a place of designated historical importance.

As of the 2011 census, the population of the district is 73,886. Located on a hill overlooking the central part of Yerevan, the administrative district of Kanaker-Zeytun has common borders with the districts of Avan, Arabkir, Kentron and Nor Nork. By the outer border it is adjacent to the provinces of Armavir, Aragatsotn and Kotayk.Kanaker-Zeytun District at Yerevan.am The district is unofficially divided into smaller neighborhoods such as Kanaker, Nor Zeytun and Monument. History Kanaker has developed as a satellite town of Yerevan throughout the history. With many historical churches and monuments, Kanaker was severely damaged in the earthquake of 1679. The town has played a key role in the Russian siege of Yerevan in 1827. Many prominent figures of Armenian literature and art are natives of Kanaker such as historian Zakaria Kanakertsi, writer Khachatur Abovian and musician Djivan Gasparyan. In order to establish the Zeytun district in 1944, the Artsvabuyn Zeytun Reconstruction Committee was formed in Aleppo, whose members were Panos Norashkharyan, Yeghia Alajajyan, Rev. Petros Kilikian, Hovsep Bshtikyan, Harutyun Azaryan, Parunak Shishikyan, KarapetKarapet Tozlikyan (Yeghyan) and Levon Chopuryan. The committee had 3 additional members in Yerevan: Avetis Surenyan, Dovlat Karanfilyan, and Dovlat Boyamian. After the repatriation of in 1948, the members of the committee received permission to construct the new Nor Zeytun settlement at the north of Yerevan. With the rapid growth of Yerevan, Kanaker and Nor Zeytun were gradually absorbed and became part of the Armenian capital. After the independence of Armenia, Kanaker and Nor Zeytun were merged and formed a single district within the capital, bearing the name Kanaker- Zeytun. Currently, the district is among the developing areas of the capital with a population of 79,600 and an area of 8.1 km¬≤. The district is home to many industrial plants including the Yerevan Champagne Wines Factory, the Coca-Cola Bottlers Armenia Factory and the Pepsi Bottlers Armenia Factory. The district is also home to the Gazprom Armenia headquarters.

It was released on 13 November 1990 on 4AD/Reprise Records in the United States and 21 November 1990 on 4AD/Nippon Columbia in Japan;https://www.discogs.com/Lush-Gala/release/1029558 the album received a limited-edition release in the United Kingdom on 3 December 1990. In support of the album, Lush toured in both the US and Japan. Upon its release, Gala failed to chart, but the album was well received by critics in both the UK and the US. \\"De-Luxe\\", which was released as a promotional single in the US, did receive considerable radio airplay and placed in the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Release Gala was compiled by Lush's record label, 4AD, as an introduction to the United States and Japanese markets. The album features the band's debut mini album Scar (1989) and Mad Love and Sweetness and Light extended plays (1990) in reverse chronological order. A cover version of ABBAs 1975 song \\"Hey Hey Helen\\"‚Äîwhich had been recorded for an abandoned anti-poll tax compilation‚Äîwas included, as well as a rerecording of Scar song \\"Scarlet\\" that had been previously released on the Melody Maker compilation Gigantic! 2 in March 1990. Gala was released on 13 November 1990 on 4AD/Reprise in the US and on 21 November on 4AD/Nippon Columbia in Japan. Both releases were only made available on CD. Upon the album's limited release in the United Kingdom on 3 December, it was made available on CD, LP and cassette. In the US, \\"De- Luxe\\" was released as a promotional-only radio single to promote Galas release; it featured the album version of the track, as well as two separate single edits as its B-side. The song peaked at No. 14 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart. To support Gala, Lush commenced two short tours of North America and Japan. The band performed eight dates in North America, beginning at Lee's Palace in Toronto on 24 November 1990 and concluding on 8 December at Club Lingerie in Los Angeles. A sold-out four-date mini tour of Japan followed, with Lush performing two nights at the FM Radio Hall in Tokyo from 11 to 12 December, Muse Hall in Osaka on 14 December and a final show at Club Quattro in Nagoya on 15 December. The tour was well received and Lush were tipped as being \\"big in Japan\\", though vocalist/guitarist Miki Berenyi was skeptical of the band's fame, telling Sounds: \\"People go, 'Ooh you've sold out Japan.' But you don't really fucking know how well you're doing. It could be like some American band saying 'Hey we sold out the [Camden] Falcon!'\\" Reception Upon its release, Gala was well received by critics. NME writer Terry Staunton rated it 8 out of 10 and said, Gala was a collection of Lush's \\"two glorious years\\" and \\"a delicious starter\\" for the band, adding \\"when the initial stocks run out, Gala will clean up in the import shops, as it is undoubtedly one of maybe a dozen (probably less) albums from this year that everyone should own\\". Writing for Select, Graham Linehan described Gala as \\"riveting\\" in his 4-out-of-5 review. He said that \\"what is surprising is the way in which the EPs that make up the album have fallen together so perfectly\\" and surmised that \\"at first it may all seem a little rich, a little too sweet for one long swallow ‚Ä¶ but give it a moment to catch your breath and it becomes clear that Lush's gameplan involves far more than retracing the steps of acts like the Cocteaus and My Bloody Valentine\\". Vox reviewer Susan Corrigan awarded the album a 9-out-of-10 rating and said that \\"together [Berenyi and Emma Anderson loop hazy vocals through hard-edged fractured melodies, evoking an unstructured sense of bliss even for the most jaded listener\\". Corrigan further described how Lush's \\"heady, expansive songs burst out of the vinyl like riotously-coloured musical fractals\\". David Stubbs wrote a largely warm review in Melody Maker, selecting \\"De-Luxe\\" and \\"Thoughtforms\\" as Galas standout tracks and describing how \\"the guitars glitter like sunshine immediately after the rain\\". In The New York Times, Jon Pareles described Gala as featuring guitars \\"swathed in electronic reverberation and other effects\\" and overdubbing, and a retrospective 4-out-of-5 review on AllMusic by Andy Kellman praised Lush's ability \\"to veer from violent and edgy noise breaks to pop effervescence\\". Kellman noted how the material on Gala was a direct influence on Chapterhouse and (though he criticised the production on the tracks from Mad Love and Sweetness and Light) concluded that Gala was \\"one of the band's career highlights\\". In 2016, Pitchfork ranked the album at No. 8 on its list of \\"The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time\\".

Bow lies about 8 miles west of Crediton.  History  Bow station from the train in 1970. The station was originally opened by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1865.Nock, O. S. (1965) The London & South Western Railway. Pub. Ian Allan. London. P. 48. The station building is a two-storey construction of Dartmoor granite with ashlar dressings and round headed windows. The platform canopy has cast iron brackets with a creeper design. There is also a single-storey waiting room and offices. Services on the line were extended further west to Lydford railway station with the inauguration of Meldon Viaduct in 1874. Constructed to rival the South Devon Railway route to Plymouth, the completion of the LSWR's own route to Plymouth saw this line become an important route with lines to Padstow and Bude as well as Plymouth. Boat trains carrying passengers from ocean liners calling at Stonehouse Pool, Plymouth and prestige services such as the Atlantic Coast Express and Devon Belle all used the route. Following publication of the Beeching Report in 1963, the Exeter to Plymouth Line was cut back to Okehampton in 1968. The line was singled on 17 October 1971.Mitchell, David (1994). British Railways Past and Present - Devon. Peterborough: Past and Present Publishing. p. 90. , Page 81 Bow, North Tawton, Sampford Courtenay and Okehampton lost their regular passenger services from 1972. The line survived, however, for the purposes of freight thanks to the activities of the British Rail ballast quarry at Meldon, three miles from Okehampton, which had an output of 300,000 tons per year. The quarry survived until the 2000s, operated by Aggregate Industries.  Future options The Dartmoor Railway is proposing to restore the interchange at Yeoford, running passenger trains past Bow, where its line meets Great Western Railway's Tarka Line. British American Railway Services, a new company created by Iowa Pacific Holdings of Chicago, became the new owner of the Dartmoor line on 4 September 2008.

The shows stars two characters, Jeremy (Brendan Coyle) and Rats (Michael McElhatton), who have both recently been released from a Dublin prison. The show takes the format of a mockumentary, with a fly-on-the-wall camera crew following the two characters, who are from thoroughly different backgrounds, as they try to reintegrate back into society. There were six episodes of the show produced, the first airing on 13 November 2000, and the final episode airing one month later. The series was followed-up by a movie based on the character Rats, Spin the Bottle. Characters =Jeremy= Dr. Jeremy Fitzgerald, played by Brendan Coyle, was a distinguished gynaecologist, living in the affluent Dublin suburb of Blackrock, before being convicted of dangerous driving causing injury. He was sentenced to a custodial sentence and sent to Dublin's Mountjoy Prison. After his release, with his license to practice medicine lost, Jeremy pursues the release of his controversial book, 'Women inside Out'. However, he struggles to find a publisher given his recent legal troubles, and this eventually leads to a breakdown. During the series, Jeremy displays his love towards a wealthy style of life, driving a new Mercedes-Benz, playing golf at his local club 'The Fitzhatton', and repeatedly describing his admiration of Michael Flatley. This is demonstrated at one point in the series when Jeremy is questioned by the camera crew as to what affect prison has had on him, and he responds that it caused him to lose his 'no-claims bonus' and raise his golf handicap by six strokes. The legal costs of defending himself in the case brought by the Ukrainian man that he hit while drink driving are large, and this causes the Fitzgeralds to sell their home in Blackrock to raise funds. Repeatedly, Jeremy disputes the man's claim that he is paralysed, and at one point Jeremy attacks the man in attempt to prove he is lying. At this stage in the series, Jeremy is seriously mentally ill, and he soon takes up home in a tent on the 7th green at the Fitzhatton. The series ends with Jeremy, now separated from his wife Helen (Deirdre O'Kane), in full-time psychiatric care . =Rats= Raymond \\"Rats\\" Doyle, played by Michael McElhatton is a character that has been in and out of trouble throughout his life. In the series, he also has just been released from prison, having been convicted of burglary. Rats struggles to find a job, with his problems compounded by the fact that his wife Sharon, along with his two children Tarquin and Snoopies, has left him. Rats has several jobs in the course of the series including security, working in a fast-food restaurant and busking. While busking, Rats performs the poetry that he writes in his spare time, and though it is crude and childish, he sees it as a serious expression of his feelings and beliefs. The uncensored and brash nature of the poetry attracts the attention of the Garda S√≠och√°na, and lands Rats in further trouble. Throughout the series, we see Rats concentrate on trying to bring his band, 'spermdotcom', into the mainstream. The band did experience some minor success some years beforehand, reaching No. 27 in the charts in Finland. The series ends with the band continuing to struggle, having been conned out of ¬£400 they had paid to arrange a gig, and eventually having to play this gig in a small gay bar in Dublin. =Helen Fitzgerald= Helen Fitzgerald, played by Deirdre O'Kane, is the middle class, middle-aged wife of Jeremy. Keen to maintain an aura of nonchalance, stability and normality, she repeatedly expresses her indignation at Jeremy's treatment by the justice system, and questions the validity of both the charges pressed against him and the credibility of the paralysed victim of Jeremy's hit-and-run. Helen lives a lavish lifestyle, and at various points throughout the series she is seen dining in expensive restaurants, attending theatrical productions and hosting garden parties. As the plot develops, we observe Helen's increasingly superficial nature, most particularly in relation to her husband. As Jeremy's mental well-being declines, Helen becomes increasingly frustrated with his inability to communicate coherently and his violent mood swings. Her frustration is also of a sexual nature, and in episode 6 she invites both Rats and the series' camera crew to have sex with her in her family home, with Jeremy residing in a tent in the back garden. Further instances of Helen's marital infidelity are also alluded to, and we learn that she engaged in sexual relations while on holidays with her friend Gwen in Paris, with a French man who 'rogered her senseless' on a 'crate of aubergines'. In later episodes, Helen is rarely seen without a glass of white wine in hand. =Tomo= Tomo, played by Peter McDonald, is Rat's best friend and fellow musician in the band Sperm.com, in which he plays guitar. His long black hair and style of dress identify him as a heavy metal fan; he is seen to wear t-shirts featuring the bands No Sweat and Ministry during the series. He is portrayed as being quite unintelligent ‚Äì a classic comedy buffoon ‚Äì and also as being overwhelmed when it comes to contact with the opposite sex. =Barney= Played by Darragh Kelly, Barney (affectionately referred to as \\"Barnser\\") is Jeremy's closest companion and golfing partner. He is blindly supportive of Jeremy and fails to see his friend's shortcomings, appearing somewhat of a side-kick. Even as the series progresses, and he appears to grow increasingly embarrassed by Jeremy's behaviour, he never overtly speaks out against him.

(1981). Blues Who's Who. New York: Da Capo Press. pp. 594‚Äì595. was an American blues singer, mandolin player and guitarist, significant as one of the first of the new generation of electric blues artists to record in Chicago after the Second World War. He was one of the few mandolin players active in blues music in the postwar era. His nickname, Man, came from his playing the mandolin. Life and career Young was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and played in string bands in Mississippi in the 1930s. He also claimed to have worked with Sleepy John Estes in Tennessee before moving to Chicago in 1940. By 1943, he was working with John Lee \\"Sonny Boy\\" Williamson and Muddy Waters. In the late 1940s he became a regular player on Maxwell Street, often with his cousin, the guitarist Johnny Williams, and in clubs with Williams and Little Walter. His first recording was made in 1947 for the Ora Nelle label, featuring Young singing \\"Money Taking Woman\\" on the A-side, accompanied by Williams, who sang \\"Worried Man Blues\\" on the B-side. For a second session in late 1948, Young and Williams were joined by Snooky Pryor on harmonica and recorded a single for the Planet label, released under the name Man Young. A later session, for J.O.B. Records, was unissued. Young played guitar behind Snooky Pryor in a session for Vee-Jay, but after that he retired from performance in the 1950s.Rowe, M. (1981).

She is most remembered as the first regular voice of Minnie Mouse during her time working at Walt Disney Productions and has been partially credited with defining Minnie's personality. Early life Garner was born in Redlands, California in 1910. She attended night classes at John H. Francis Polytechnic High School in Los Angeles where she studied art. Work at Disney Garner started working at Walt Disney Productions on February 17, 1930 after interviewing the previous year. She worked in the ink and paint department, first working as a cel painter and later as an inker. The studio at the time was a small organization of about 35 employees. After Garner had been working about six months, she auditioned for the voice of Minnie Mouse at the studio's sound stage, then located on Melrose Avenue. Because Minnie was to play a Mexican in the upcoming film The Cactus Kid, Burt Gillett had asked the Ink and Paint department, which was entirely women, if anyone could speak Spanish. Only Garner and another woman responded, and when the other woman was unwilling to sing, Garner was cast for the role. She went on to voice Minnie in more than 40 films over a decade. Occasionally Garner also provided additional voices, such as cat meows (Three Orphan Kittens, Lend a Paw), dog barking, and crowd noises. During the Disney animators' strike of 1941, Garner shot home movies of the picket lines in color. Some of this footage appears in the 2001 documentary Walt ‚Äì The Man Behind the Myth. Garner was sympathetic to the studio during the strike, commenting \\"I couldn't see that we were not being treated fairly. People weren't so union oriented then I guess.\\" She described the atmosphere at the studio as \\"one big family\\" before the studio was unionized. Her final role as Minnie would be in the 1942 war effort short \\"Out of the Frying Pan and into The Firing Line\\". Garner worked at the Disney studio off and on for 12 years, during which she also did work for some other studios, including Walter Lantz Productions. After Disney Garner eventually married Richard B. Wall and started a family. In 1941 she permanently quit her job at Disney to devote more time to her children. The family later moved north to Los Gatos where she again worked in the cartoon business, producing a newspaper comic strip called El Gato for the Los Gatos Times-Observer. During this time she also worked on different kinds of painting media and ceramics. Some of her artwork she gave to friends, and others she donated to charities and church bazaars.Inking at Disney, circa 1931 at MichaelBarrier.com Death She died on July 26, 1993 in Grass Valley, California, at the age of 83.

The cover of the album features Mina's son Massimiliano Pani dressed as a hockey player. The album \\"Musica\\", the opening track expresses a feeling of renewal. The use of the synthesizer and Mina‚Äôs voice creates an almost futuristic sound, a rarefied atmospheric sound.http://noisey.vice.com/it/blog/italian-folgorati- mina This atmosphere sound collides with the roughness of \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\".http://www.italiansongs.org/2007/05/mina-best-italian-singer.html On this track Mina sings with a richer and gravely and coarse tone, creating a roughness to this remake of a classic song. With \\"Quatt‚Äôore ‚Äòe tiempo\\" and we have one of the few moments more classic and traditional. The lyrics tell of a sequence of images that chases almost dancing in the rhythm of the melody. Neapolitan drama away from the usual melodic Neapolitan, the song is a free implementation of the famous ‚ÄúPiet√† Signor‚Äùhttp://artsongcentral.com/2009/stradella-attr-pieta-signore/ composed by Alessandro Stradella. \\"Chi sar√†\\" is the composition by Simon Luca.http://www.italianprog.com/it/a_simonluca.htm The melody is charming and the simplicity of both the music and lyrics make for a great song. The layering of Mina‚Äôs voice adds an interesting layer to the production of the song. \\"Voglio stare bene\\" is a song that has similarities to the melody structure as Bohemian Rhapsody by \\"Queen\\". The song begins dramatically and there are constant changes in the tempo, creating different hues.http://noisey.vice.com/it/blog/italian-folgorati-mina The Shel Shapiro penned \\"I know\\" has a powerful chorus and with the sheer power of Mina‚Äôs voice makes for a great marriage of vocals and music. On Tra Napoli e un bicchiere the voices of Mina and Simon Luca play in unison to the endless intricate tones and scales to excellence. The first volume ends with Capisco written by Massimiliano Pani. A disco-laced track with fast-paced lyrics and a thumping beat incorporating synthesisers. The second volume starts off with Fermer√≤ qualcuno. The tone is dramatic and Mina sings with a sense of loneliness that is infused in every line of the text, with a lavish and engaging musical arrangement. L'amore √® bestia, l'amore √® poeta has a reggae flavour to it, a new musical exploration for Mina. A true musical gem on this album is a cover of the Beatles She's Leaving Home . The arrangement is more sumptuous and less saccharine than the arrangement. Paul McCartney and John Lennon liked that arrangement that they sent a telegram of congratulations to Maestro Mario Robbiani.http://blog.libero.it/MINA50/commenti.php?msgid=3597802&id;=85584 Qualcosa in pi√π is another defining moment of the album. The song structure and crescendo is musically innovative and sublime. Colori has Mina explore the blues. The lyrics are beautiful and the arrangement transcendent. On the track Bambola gonfiabile the theme of exaggeration is essential. The song speaks of a Bambola gonfiabile (Inflatable doll) the music and lyrics are hard rock, sung so aggressively. Radio is a song which lyrics are centred on jealousy. Touching tones and atmospheres at times poignant, given away by a base d 'fabulous arches and the magical sound of the flugelhorn. Buonanotte, buonanotte is the ends volume two. The song has a lyrical sweetness in the verses and the sumptuousness arrangement of Massimiliano Pani.

The school was founded in 1974 by the Basilian Fathers and the MSSB as a semi-private school, though the current school building was originally opened in 1966 as Humbergrove Secondary School by the Etobicoke Board of Education when the board merged into the Toronto District School Board in which the school property is leased to the MSSB/TCDSB since 1988. The Humbergrove school was renamed to Marian Academy in 1988 and closed in 2002, though Carr occupied the property since 2007. Carr offers the Advanced Placement (AP) academic program and is known for its elite basketball team. The motto of the school is Domine ut Videam, which translates into \\"Lord That I Might See\\". History =Background= Henry Carr was a Basilian father also known as Father \\"Hank\\" Carr. He enhanced Catholic education in Canada by broadening the curriculum at University of Toronto's University of St. Michael‚Äôs College. He also arranged for St. Michael's to be a federated arts college. He was the co-founder of the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, and an advocate for the inclusion of religious education in curricular studies. Carr was born and raised in Oshawa, Ontario in 1880, one of nine children. He was ordained as a priest on September 3, 1905. He taught at St. Michael's College and acted as a president of the Institute of Medieval Studies until 1936 and served as the principal at St. Thomas More College in Saskatchewan. He died of pneumonia on November 28, 1963 in Vancouver, British Columbia. =History= The original site of Father Henry Carr C.S.S. from 1974‚Äì2007. The building was built in 1976. Presently, it has become the Rexdale community hub. After the opening of one of Etobicoke's first Catholic high schools, Bishop Power High School for boys in 1957 by the Basilian Fathers, the order also opened St. Basil-the-Great College School in northwestern Toronto in 1962. At that time, pupils attended Roman Catholic schools nearby such as St. Andrew, St. Angela, St. Dorothy, or St. Jude while its graduates attended either North Albion Collegiate Institute or West Humber Collegiate Institute. On September 3, 1974 the Basilian Fathers and the Metropolitan Separate School Board opened Father Henry Carr High School under its founding principal, Fr. Thomas Mohan C.S.B. The school building was erected in 1976 on the original 21 Panorama Court building on Kipling and Albion. The school facilities in the original building consisted of one main two-story building and 16 portables, with a cafeteria, gymnasium/auditorium and a playing field. Throughout the school's early existence, it operated as a private school for Grades 11 to 13 only while the MSSB educated grade 9 and 10 students. This changed in 1985 when the Government of Ontario passed Bill 30 to extend funding to Roman Catholic high schools beyond grade 10 and Carr was ceased to be a private school in 1987. However, in 1988, nearby Humbergrove Secondary School, built in 1966 on Martin Grove Road, was closed and reopened by the MSSB as Marian Academy with 165 pupils. The school closed its doors in 2002 due to declining enrollment.http://www.tdsb.on.ca/boardroom/bd_agenda/uploads/generalinfo/70216%20vacant%20closed.pdf The school moved to the former Marian building in September 2007. The new Carr campus, at the cost of $10 million, it consisted of the new main entrance, central community atrium, cafeteria, drama studio, labs, three automotive bays, new windows, stonework and landscaping.http://www.insidetoronto.com/news- story/12715-tcdsb-s-34m-revitalizes-high-schools/https://www.toronto.com/news- story/5927-johnson-carr-break-ground/ The former school building was sold to the City of Toronto in 2009 and reopened the old Panorama school building as a community hub.https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2009/cd/bgrd/backgroundfile-18645.pdf The renovated school was designed by Makrimichalos Cugini Architects Inc. whilst the original school building built in 1966 was designed by architect Gordon S. Adamson. Academics and community Father Henry Carr Catholic Secondary School is a composite co-educational school located in the area of Finch and Martin Grove in Rexdale in northwest Etobicoke.

He received his B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1966 and his Ph.D. in Sociology from New York University in 1971. He has written or co-authored nine books and more than fifty journal articles and book chapters. His work appears in such periodicals as Symbolic Interaction, Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, Journal of Qualitative Health Research, the Gerontologist, and the International Journal of Aging and Human Development. His work has largely clustered in three areas: urban life and culture, aging, and the study of mental health and illness. Professor Karp‚Äôs career-long research work is both motivated by and advances ‚Äúsymbolic interaction theory,‚Äù sociology‚Äôs distinctive version of social psychology. His diverse writings are animated and united by the core ‚Äúsocial constructionist‚Äù question, ‚ÄúHow do people make sense of complicated life circumstances and how are their behaviors, emotions, and attitudes linked to such interpretive processes?‚Äù Over the course of more than 40 years he has explored a variety of topics. His doctoral dissertation on the nature of ‚Äúurban anonymity‚Äù involved participant observation in New York‚Äôs Times Square area. This initial interest in the social psychology of city life led to the publication of his co- authored and widely respected book entitled Being Urban: A Sociology of City Life. As an assistant professor at Boston College he also co-authored a book on the ‚Äúsociology of everyday life.‚Äù Always using his sociology to reflect on issues of personal significance, Professor Karp later collaborated on Experiencing the Life Cycle: A Social Psychology of Aging. This book challenged deterministic notions of a universal aging process. In the early 1980s Professor Karp wrote a series of path-breaking papers on the social and emotional lives of people in their fifties, at that point a neglected moment in the life course. Among the several articles produced from this study, the most provocative and widely acclaimed was his paper entitled ‚ÄúA Decade of Reminders.‚Äù This article (featured in the science section of The New York Times) argues that there is an internal quickening of one‚Äôs feelings of growing older in the fifties as those in that decade experience a momentum of social reminders about age (Karp calls them body reminders, generational reminders, contextual reminders, and mortality reminders). The paper is a model for those who wish to understand the intersection of global social factors, the immediate life circumstances of individuals, and how people construct personal identities. Like many of his journal articles, his classic study with William C. Yoels entitled ‚ÄúThe College Classroom: Some Observations on the Nature of Student Participation‚Äù has been reprinted multiple times. In addition, he has co-authored a series of articles on what happens in upper- middle-class families during the year that a child applies to college. However, for nearly two decades his abiding interest has been to decipher the experiences of mental illness. Professor Karp began his series of books and articles on mental illness in the late 1980s. His exceedingly influential book entitled Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness (Oxford, 1996) is the first in a series of three books on the subject. This book reveals Karp‚Äôs status as a methodological craftsperson who artfully combines in-depth interviewing, personal experience, and cogent analysis. This book was very positively reviewed in The New York Times and won the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction‚Äôs Charles Horton Cooley Award in 1996. Speaking of Sadness enjoys a wide public audience and is frequently used in basic sociology courses, courses on social psychology, and courses on health and illness, among others. Professor Karp‚Äôs second book on mental illness was published in 2000. The Burden of Sympathy: How Families Cope with Mental Illness (Oxford, 2000) is an equally compelling book that makes an enduring contribution to the study of mental illnesses and the emotions that surround them. Based on 60 interviews with the family and friends of persons with depression, manic-depression, or schizophrenia, this book shows how caregivers negotiate enormously complicated boundaries of obligation. As with Speaking of Sadness, this book brings sophisticated sociology to a general public. In 2006 Harvard University Press published Professor Karp‚Äôs third book on mental illness. Is It Me or My Meds? Living with Antidepressants focuses on the relationship between pills and person hood. Karp powerfully argues that while all drugs potentially impact our sense of self, psychiatric drugs are unique because they are designed to reshape people‚Äôs moods, feelings, behaviors and perceptions. To the extent that these drugs alter people‚Äôs emotions they have a profound effect on the essential nature of their identities. Taken together, his writings pose critical challenges to exclusively biological explanations of and treatments for mental illness. His three books on mental illness have received a number of exceptionally favorable academic reviews and are enormously valuable resources for patients and caregivers, mental health practitioners, and fellow sociologists.

Ltd., He was preceded to France by the first Siamese embassy to France, which had been composed of two Siamese ambassadors and Father B√©nigne Vachet, who had left Siam for France on January 5, 1684. Asia in the Making of Europe, by Donald F. Lach, p. 253 Pan was a nephew of King Ekathotsarot and a great- grandfather of King Rama I, the founder of the Chakri Dynasty. His older brother, Lek (‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏•‡πá‡∏Å), held the post of foreign minister before him.Smithies (2002), p. 100 Early life Pan was born to a Siamese woman Chao Mae Dusit in Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1633. Chao was then a wet nurse for Phetracha in 1632, and later for Prince Narai. Pan was a kind of foster brother to them. Names Pan (; ) was his given name. As foreign minister, he was styled Chaophraya Kosathibodi (; ). He is colloquially called Kosa Pan (; ). He is also known by his former style as a first-class diplomat: Ok-phra Wisut Sunthon (; ). Contemporary French documents recorded his name as Ooc, Pravisoutsonthoon Raatchathoud (‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏£ ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏ó‡∏π‡∏ï). His success in diplomatic negotiations earned him the epithet golden-tongued diplomat (). Embassy to France (1686) A portrait of Kosa Pan by Charles Le Brun, 1686 Siamese embassy to Louis XIV led by Pan in 1686, by Nicolas Larmessin To accompany the return of the 1685 French embassy to Siam of Chevalier de Chaumont and Fran√ßois-Timol√©on de Choisy, Pan was selected by Constantine Phaulkon, the Prime Counsellor to King Narai, to lead an embassy to France. Pan set out for France in 1686 on two French ships with two other Siamese ambassadors, Ok-luang Kanlaya Ratchamaitri and Ok-khun Si Wisan Wacha,Smithies (1999), p. 59 and by the Jesuit Father Guy Tachard.Gunn, p. 188 The embassy was bringing a proposal for an eternal alliance between France and Siam. Pan's embassy was met with a rapturous reception and caused a sensation in the courts and society of Europe. The mission landed at Brest, France and journeyed to Versailles, constantly surrounded by crowds of curious onlookers.Chakrabongse, C., 1960, Lords of Life, London: Alvin Redman Limited The embassy stayed in France from June 1686 to March 1687. 1688 Siamese revolution Pan, sketched in France (1686) Upon his return to Siam, Pan was pressured to become a supporter of Petracha's anti-French faction of dissatisfied nobles, who resented the power that the French held in Siam. The following revolution toppled Narai and ousted the French forces. Pan was sent to negotiate with their officials. He was appointed by Petracha as his Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Smithies (2002), p. 35Smithies (1999), p. 2 Pan was met in Siam in 1690 by the German naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer. The naturalist noted \\"pictures of the Royal family of France and European maps\\" hanging \\"in the hall of his [Pan's] house\\":Suarez, p. 30 In 1699, Pan and Petracha received a visit from the Jesuit Father Guy Tachard. The meeting was formal and did not produce any closer relations.Smithies (2002), p. 185 Death Pan was later accused of having affinity to the French and loyalty to his former King, Narai. He was disgraced, and King Phetracha ordered his nose cut off. He reportedly committed suicide on 15 November 1699, according to the Dutch. His duties were taken over by Okya Maha Amath, one of the King's favorites. Pan is said to be the direct ancestor of King Rama I, founder of the present ruling dynasty of Thailand.Smithies (2002), p. 180 See also *France-Thailand relations Notes Ambassador Pan and Siamese envoys pay their respect to Louis XIV at his court in Versailles.

The house, built in 1869, is historically significant as the only surviving structure of the first National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, established at Togus in 1866 to serve American Civil War veterans. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974. It is a contributing element of the historic district encompassing the Togus VA campus. and Description and history 200px The Governor's House is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a mansard roof and a granite foundation. Its main block is three bays wide and three bays deep, with shuttered sash windows set in openings with granite sills and segmented- arch lintels. The main (south-facing) facade, has a single-story enclosed porch across its center half, topped by a shallow-pitch hip roof. A two-story wing extends to the rear of the main block, significantly increasing its size. The house as 22 rooms in all, and has retained most of its original woodwork. The site that is now the Togus VA facility is the first veterans facility established by the United States. It was established by an act of Congress in 1866, to provide a space for \\"any worthy soldier\\" who was \\"suffering such a degree of disability\\" so as to need such a facility. The property acquired by the government was a summer resort, capitalizing on local mineral springs, that had gone bankrupt in the war. This facility opened in 1866, and its main buildings were destroyed or damaged by fire in 1868. The government embarked on a major building campaign in 1868-69, of which the residence of the facility's governor (now director) is now the only surviving building. It continues to be used for residential purposes.

Perioperative care may be provided by an anesthesiologist, Intensivist, an internal medicine generalist or hospitalist working with surgical colleagues. Background Perioperative medicine encompasses the care of the patient preparing for, having and recuperating from surgery. In the practice of perioperative medicine the surgeon, anesthesiologist, intensivist and medical consultant work in concert. The medical knowledge distinct to this field includes that of operative risk and complications, of patient specific risks, of methods to reduce risk, and of the management of medical illness during this time period. Evidence supporting best practices in perioperative medicine is expanding, though historically this field has been directed by common practice and experience. It remains a field governed primarily by the art of medicine. Notably, in the last decade, there has been a concerted effort by various anesthesia representative bodies to incorporate greater teaching into management of patients during the perioperative period. Specifically, an annual summit has been held in the US, and various courses exist to encourage this field of medicine.

It was founded by the Loretto Sisters Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1915, whose founder, Blessed Mary Ward, advocated excellent education for young women so that they might ‚Äúdo great things‚Äù. The name ‚Äúcollege‚Äù refers to the school's association with Loretto College, a component of the University of St. Michael's College, part of the University of Toronto.  History  Loretto College School was founded as a private school by the Sisters of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1915. The roots of the school go back to 1847 when the Loretto Sisters from Ireland opened a boarding and day school for young Catholic women in Toronto. However, the origins began in 1913 while the building is being erected, classes for the school began in a three storey house with the commercial students from Bond Street moved to the \\"Casa\\" and the 538 music students moved the following year. The Loretto Day School opened in September 1915 on Brunswick Avenue with 200 girls, boarders and day students from Grades 1 to 13 with a few boys from Grades 1 to 3.http://lorettocollege100.weebly.com/history.html Afterwards, Casa became simply a residents for the sisters. In 1918, following the move to Brunswick from the old Abbey, the school became known as \\"Loretto Abbey Day School and College\\" before becoming \\"Loretto College School\\" even though the College component moved to St. George Street in 1937. With the school population growing, Casa and Bains (acquired in 1947) were demolished in May 1953 and the modern three storey high school was erected and opened in September 1954. Eventually, the Junior School was shuttered in June 1949, followed by the Boarding School in 1960 and the Secretarial Department in 1981. In 1967, the Sisters entered an agreement with the Metropolitan Separate School Board to educate the school's Grade 9 and 10 students, while the Sisters retained control of Grades 11-13 classes. Beginning 1985, following the provincial extension of high school funding for the final three grades of high school, Loretto College is ceased to be a private school As more and more young women attending LCS with the growing population, so does the covenant, starting in 1986, LCS opened an annex on the former site of St. Dominic Savio Catholic School on Bathurst Street to accommodate overflow from the main campus. On December 3, 1999, a fire broke out at the Brunswick building with 16 nuns escaping the blaze. The fire marked the end of an era of the Sisters living in the property. By 2001, the Loretto Sisters sold the Brunswick properties to a developer and the school was relocated on Markham Street in the former St. Peter Catholic School.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nuns-escape-fire-1.194812 The school was relocated to a new building on 151 Rosemount Avenue, the former home of Richard W. Scott (Senior) Catholic School, in September 2005. Originally, the site was shared by Bishop Francis Marrocco Catholic High School that opened in 1986. The Brunswick building has since now been converted into condominiums. Student life Loretto College is a semestered school. Students select a program of study from courses at the academic, applied, open and locally developed levels. In Grade 11 and 12, courses are selected based on the student's post-secondary choice of destination- university, college, apprenticeship or the workplace. Loretto's special education services are delivered through integrated programming in the mainstream classroom. In addition to the academic program of study, students are encouraged to explore and develop the full range of their talents and interests by participating in athletics, student government, peer ministry, yearbook, leadership, drama, dance and musical activities. Spiritual life As at all Catholic schools, students at Loretto College School take a religion course each year. The school's faith life also includes retreats, liturgies, charitable works and Catholic perspectives across the curriculum. Mary Ward and the Loretto Sisters are role models.  Academics  One out of six students are on the school's honour roll. 84% of applicants have been accepted into post-secondary education in recent years.

Honing is primarily used to improve the geometric form of a surface, but can also improve the surface finish. Typical applications are the finishing of cylinders for internal combustion engines, air bearing spindles and gears. There are many types of hones, but all consist of one or more abrasive stones that are held under pressure against the surface they are working on. In terms of sharpening knives, a honing steel neither hones nor sharpens knives, but simply realigns the metal along the edge of the blade. Other similar processes are lapping and superfinishing. Honing stones Superabrasives and hone head for cylinders Honing tools Honing uses a special tool, called a honing stone or a hone, to achieve a precision surface. The hone is composed of abrasive grains that are bound together with an adhesive. Generally, honing grains are irregularly shaped and about 10 to 50 micrometers in diameter (300 to 1500 mesh grit). Smaller grain sizes produce a smoother surface on the workpiece. A honing stone is similar to a grinding wheel in many ways, but honing stones are usually more friable, so that they conform to the shape of the workpiece as they wear in. To counteract their friability, honing stones may be treated with wax or sulfur to improve life; wax is usually preferred for environmental reasons. Any abrasive material may be used to create a honing stone, but the most commonly used are corundum, silicon carbide, cubic boron nitride, and diamond. The choice of abrasive material is usually driven by the characteristics of the workpiece material. In most cases, corundum or silicon carbide are acceptable, but extremely hard workpiece materials must be honed using superabrasives. The hone is usually turned in the bore while being moved in and out. Special cutting fluids are used to give a smooth cutting action and to remove the material that has been abraded. Machines can be portable, simple manual machines, or fully automatic with gauging depending on the application. Modern advances in abrasives have made it possible to remove much larger amount of material than was previously possible. This has displaced grinding in many applications where \\"through machining\\" is possible. External hones perform the same function on shafts. Process mechanics Since honing stones look similar to grinding wheels, it is tempting to think of honing as a form of low-stock removal grinding. Instead, it is better to think of it as a self-truing grinding process. In grinding, the wheel follows a simple path. For example, in plunge grinding a shaft, the wheel moves in towards the axis of the part, grinds it, and then moves back out. Since each slice of the wheel repeatedly contacts the same slice of the workpiece, any inaccuracies in the geometric shape of the grinding wheel will be transferred onto the part. Therefore, the accuracy of the finished workpiece geometry is limited to the accuracy of the truing dresser. The accuracy becomes even worse as the grind wheel wears, so truing must occur periodically to reshape it. The limitation on geometric accuracy is overcome in honing because the honing stone follows a complex path. In bore honing, for example, the stone moves along two paths simultaneously. The stones are pressed radially outward to enlarge the hole while they simultaneously oscillate axially. Due to the oscillation, each slice of the honing stones touch a large area of the workpiece. Therefore, imperfections in the honing stone's profile cannot transfer to the bore. Instead, both the bore and the honing stones conform to the average shape of the honing stones' motion, which in the case of bore honing is a cylinder. This averaging effect occurs in all honing processes; both the workpiece and stones erode until they conform to the average shape of the stones' cutting surface. Since the honing stones tend to erode towards a desired geometric shape, there is no need to true them. As a result of the averaging effect, the accuracy of a honed component often exceeds the accuracy of the machine tool that created it. The path of the stone is not the only difference between grinding and honing machines, they also differ in the stiffness of their construction. Honing machines are much more compliant than grinders. The purpose of grinding is to achieve a tight size tolerance. To do this, the grinding wheel must be moved to an exact position relative to the workpiece. Therefore, a grinding machine must be very stiff and its axes must move with very high precision. A honing machine is relatively accurate and perfect. Instead of relying on the accuracy of the machine tool, it relies on the averaging effect between the stone and the workpiece. Compliance is a requirement of a honing machine that is necessary for the averaging effect to occur. This leads to an obvious difference between the two machines: in a grinder the stone is rigidly attached to a slide, while in honing the stone is actuated with pneumatic or hydraulic pressure. High-precision workpieces are usually ground and then honed. Grinding determines the size, and honing improves the shape. The difference between honing and grinding is always same. Some grinders have complex movements and are self-truing, and some honing machines are equipped with in-process gauging for size control. Many through- feed grinding operations rely on the same averaging effect as honing. Honing configurations A flat honing machine * Bore honing * Flat honing * OD honing / Super Finish / Fine Finish (taper and straight) * Spherical honing * Track/raceway honing Economics Since honing is a high-precision process, it is also relatively expensive. Therefore, it is only used in components that demand the highest level of precision. It is typically the last manufacturing operation before the part is shipped to a customer. The dimensional size of the object is established by preceding operations, the last of which is usually grinding. Then the part is honed to improve a form characteristic such as roundness, flatness, cylindricity, or sphericity. Performance advantages of honed surfaces Since honing is a relatively expensive manufacturing process, it can only be economically justified for applications that require very good form accuracy. The improved shape after honing may result in a quieter running or higher-precision component. The flexible honing tool provides a relatively inexpensive honing process. This tool produces a controlled surface condition unobtainable by any other method. It involves finish, geometry and metallurgical structure. A high-percentage plateau free of cut, torn and folded metal is produced. The flexible hone is a resilient, flexible honing tool with a soft cutting action. The abrasive globules each have independent suspension that assures the tool to be self-centering, self- aligning to the bore, and self-compensating for wear. Cross-hatch finish A \\"cross-hatch\\" pattern is used to retain oil or grease to ensure proper lubrication and ring seal of pistons in cylinders. A smooth glazed cylinder wall can cause piston ring and cylinder scuffing. The \\"cross-hatch\\" pattern is used on brake rotors and flywheels. Plateau finish The plateau finish is one characterised by the removal of \\"peaks\\" in the metal while leaving the cross-hatch intact for oil retention. The plateaued finish increases the bearing area of the finish and does not require the piston or ring to \\"break in\\" the cylinder walls. Plateau honing specification: # Rz .... 3‚Äì6 micrometres, # Rpk.... ‚â§0.3 micrometres, # Rk..... 0.3‚Äì1.5 micrometres, # Rvk.... 0.8‚Äì2.0 micrometres.

The episode was written by series creator Shonda Rhimes and directed by co-executive producer Peter Horton. This episode is the first of a two-part story, concluding its plot on the following episode, \\"As We Know It\\". It originally aired on February 5, 2006, serving as the lead-out program for Super Bowl XL. On its original broadcast, \\"It's the End of the World\\" was watched by 38.1 million viewers. It is the highest rated and most watched episode of the series. The episode, along with its second part, secured writer Shonda Rhimes a 58th Primetime Emmy Awards nomination in the Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series category. Plot The episode begins with a dream of Izzie, Cristina, Meredith, and George in the shower together. It's George's dream. Meredith refuses to go to work as she has this feeling that she will die. George and Izzie cannot get her out of bed, they have to call in Cristina. Once at the hospital, the premonition seems to have some validity. A trauma victim is brought in by the paramedics; one of them, Hannah (played by guest star Christina Ricci), has her hand inside the victim's chest cavity to stop the bleeding. As Alex soon discovers, though, Hannah's hand is not the only thing inside of this patient; after firing a homemade bazooka, he's also got a piece of unexploded ammunition inside of him. This places the hospital on Code Black, which essentially shuts down the surgical wing‚Äîsave for the one operation that has already begun: Derek and Cristina operating on the brain of a man who happens to be Bailey's husband, while Bailey goes into labor and refuses to have her baby until her husband arrives. Bailey's husband got into a car accident trying to get to the hospital on time because Bailey was going into labor. Though the bomb squad, led by Dylan Young (played by guest star Kyle Chandler), wants to clear out the ORs of all unnecessary personnel, Derek, Cristina, and Meredith all insist on staying. After a chat with George about being \\"doers versus watchers\\" (they feel Cristina and Meredith are the \\"doers\\"), Izzie decides to ignite things with Alex‚Äîin the supply closet. Richard is trying his best to keep the hospital in some sort of order amidst the chaos, but he's having a tough time. In fact, things degrade quite quickly, most notably when an anesthesiologist leaves Hannah alone with the patient and the bomb while all the other doctors are strategizing with Dylan. Meredith finds Hannah having a nervous breakdown, about to pull her hand out and potentially put them all in danger (not to mention kill the patient, whose bleeding she is suppressing). Hannah does pull her hand out and flee the scene‚Äîbut not before Meredith can take her place as the person with her hand in the patient.

The architecture of Ethiopia varies greatly from region to region. Over the years, it has incorporated various architectural styles and techniques. D ømt (c. 800-400 BC) The best known building of the period in the region is the ruined 8th- century BC multi-story tower at Yeha in Ethiopia, believed to have been the capital of D ømt. Ashlar masonry was especially dominant during this period, owing to South Arabian influence where the style was extremely common for monumental structures. Aksumite architecture Abune Aregawi at the Debre Damo monastery, constructed around the mid-6th century. Aksumite architecture flourished in the region from the 4th century BC onward. It persisted even after the transition from the Aksumite dynasty to the Zagwe dynasty in the 12th century, as attested by the numerous Aksumite influences in and around the medieval churches of Lalibela. Stelae (hawilts) and later entire churches were carved out of single blocks of rock. This was later emulated at Lalibela and throughout the Tigray Province, especially during the early-mid medieval period (c. 10th and 11th centuries in Tigray, mainly 12th century around Lalibela). Other monumental structures include massive underground tombs, often located beneath stelae. Among the most spectacular survivals are the giant stelae, one of which, now fallen (scholars think that it may have fallen during or immediately after erection), is the single largest monolithic structure ever erected (or attempted to be erected). Other well-known structures employing the use of monoliths include tombs such as the \\"Tomb of the False Door\\" and the tombs of Kaleb and Gebre Mesqel in Axum. Most structures, however, like palaces, villas, commoner's houses, and other churches and monasteries, were built of alternating layers of stone and wood. The protruding wooden support beams in these structures have been named \\"monkey heads\\" and are a staple of Aksumite architecture and a mark of Aksumite influence in later structures. Some examples of this style had whitewashed exteriors and/or interiors, such as the medieval 12th-century monastery of Yemrehanna Krestos near Lalibela, built during the Zagwe dynasty in Aksumite style. Contemporary houses were one-room stone structures, or two- storey square houses, or roundhouses of sandstone with basalt foundations. Villas were generally two to four storeys tall and built on sprawling rectangular plans (cf. Dungur ruins). A good example of still-standing Aksumite architecture is the monastery of Debre Damo from the 6th century. Zagwe dynasty Lalibela's monolithic church Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el. Ethiopian architecture continued to expand from the Aksumite style, but also incorporating new traditions with the expansion of the Ethiopian state. Styles incorporated more wood and rounder structures in commoner's architecture in the center of the country and the south, and these stylistic influencies were manifested in the slow construction of churches and monasteries. Throughout the medieval period, Aksumite architecture and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the churches of Lalibela were carved). Biete Medhane Alem in Lalibela, the largest monolithic church in the world. Throughout the medieval period, and especially from the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of Tigray, which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as Adadi Maryam (15th century), about 100 km south of Addis Abeba. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the 11 monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all 11 structures to the eponymous King Lalibela (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and Ethiopisant David Phillipson postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 A.D., originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.David Keys: Medieval Houses of God, or Ancient Fortresses? Gondarine architecture Fasilides' castle in Fasil Ghebbi, Gondar. During the early modern period, the absorption of new diverse influences such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian style began with the arrival of Portuguese Jesuit missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in its fight against Adal, and later Jesuits came hoping to convert the country. Some Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during its war with the Ottoman Empire (see Habesh), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally easily defensible because of its numerous ambas or flat- topped mountains and rugged terrain, yielded little tactical use from the structures in contrast to their advantages in the flat terrain of Europe and other areas, and so had until this point little developed the tradition. Castles were built especially beginning with the reign of Sarsa Dengel around the Lake Tana region, and subsequent Emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the Fasil Ghebbi (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital (1635), Gondar. Emperor Susenyos (r.1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication; during this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), and Jesuit masons and their styles, as well as local masons, some of whom were Beta Israel. With the reign of his son Fasilides, most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries especially and also influenced modern 19th-century and later styles.

The Ranch-style house May grew up in San Diego, California. He built Monterey-style furniture as a young man. As a residential/building designer, May designed projects throughout Southern California, including the regions around San Diego, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara, California. He is credited with creating the California Ranch-style house in 1932. He never had the need to formally register as a licensed architect. During his career May designed numerous commercial buildings, over a thousand custom residences, and from model house prototypes more than eighteen thousand tract houses had his imprint. May synthesized Spanish Colonial Revival architecture with abstracted California adobe ranchos and Modern architecture. Robert Mondavi chose May to design his winery in which he incorporated features found in construction of California Missions. During the 1950s May, along with colleague Chris Choate designed prefabricated tract ranch homes which they sold to builders across the US. Many of these prefab tracts like Rancho Estates in Long Beach were popular and resulted in many homes in the tracts being built and sold. Some, particularity those outside of California, were unprofitable and only resulted in the model homes being built. The partnership between May and Choate ended in 1956 with May's departure. May died in 1989 at the age of 80, at his estate \\"Mandalay\\" in Sullivan Canyon in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.

The majority of Kendall Drive, between State Road 997 at The Hammocks and US 1 (State Road 5) on the Kendall‚ÄìPinecrest border, is signed as the State Road 94 (SR 94). The road serves as a major arterial road through the suburbs of the southern Miami metropolitan area, connecting its predominantly residential neighborhoods to shopping districts and to three freeways, allowing commuter travel. Route description Palmetto Expressway. Kendall Drive (Southwest 88th Street locally) begins as a private road servicing a quarry just to the west of State Road 997, heading east. Upon reaching SR 997, the road gains the SR 94 designation and continues east through farmland as a four-laned divided road. From here, the road marks the northern boundary of The Hammocks as it first turns to the southeast and then immediately turns back eastwards, subsequently following this orientation for most of its remaining route. Just after it comes out of the curve, Kendall Drive enters suburbia with a shopping strip forming first along the right side of the road, the left following after crossing Southwest 167th Avenue. The road's width expands to six lanes by the time it crosses Southwest 162nd Avenue. At Southwest 157th Avenue, Kendall Drive forms the boundary between The Hammocks, to its south, and Kendall West, to its north. SR 94 passes between neighborhoods and by more shops for the next mile (1.6 km), reaching Southwest 147th Avenue where Kendall West's southern boundary is replaced by Kendale Lakes'. For the , Kendall Drive passes between more neighborhoods, condominium complexes and by some local shopping malls before arriving at Lindgren Road (Southwest 137th Avenue), SR 825's northern terminus. Now running along the boundary between Kendale Lakes and The Crossings, Kendall Drive's surroundings grow more commercial as it approaches the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (HEFT) after with shopping malls and motels surrounding the interchange. As SR 94 passes under the HEFT, it enters its namesake locality of Kendall. Until it reaches Southwest 107th Avenue (SR 985), Kendall Drive is surrounded predominantly by condominium complexes; while past it, the road runs by houses on its run to the Don Shula Expressway (SR 874), crossing the former Seaboard Coast Line Railroad tracks just prior to the interchange. A similar neighborhood lies beyond the expressway underpass as SR 94 continues eastwards, though its surroundings are soon broken up by the Baptist Hospital of Miami to the road's south as it approaches Galloway Road (SR 973). More houses and the occasional condominium complex line Kendall Drive for the next mile, whereupon it interchanges with the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826). Beyond, the Dadeland Mall takes up the northern side of Kendall Drive for the next half-mile (0.8 km) while the southern side features mid-rise office and apartment buildings. Immediately after passing under the Metrorail tracks, SR 94 terminates at US 1 on the Kendall‚ÄìPinecrest boundary. Kendall Drive and Southwest 88th Street continue east past the oblique junction with US 1 as a four-laned divided road, surrounded by condominiums, until it crosses Ludlam Road and narrows to a tree-lined two-laned undivided residential road as it passes Gulliver Preparatory School. Mansions and large-lot houses border the road to the south, with villas to the north as Kendall Drive continues eastwards, before turning more and more markedly to the southeast as it approaches the Snapper Creek Canal and Red Road (Southwest 57th Avenue). Southwest 88th Street takes a sharp dogleg to the left, sharing Red Road's bridge over the canal before continuing east again. Now running along a northern border of Coral Gables, Kendall Drive continues east past more houses and lakeside villas until it reaches its end at an intersection with Old Cutler Road. History Like its eponymous community, Kendall Drive is named for Henry John Boughton Kendall, a trustee of the Florida Land and Mortgage Company which purchased the tract of land now situated between Southwest 88th and Southwest 104th Streets in 1883. Henry Kendall managed the fruit groves set up by the company in the area. Southwest 88th Street, the road along the northern end of the holdings, began to be referred to as \\"North\\" Kendall Drive, although the application of the \\"North\\" component of the name is applied inconsistently along the road's signage. Until a series of truncations throughout the system of State Roads by the Florida Department of Transportation, SR 94 extended eastward to SR 959 at the intersection of Kendall Drive and Red Road (South 88th Street and West 57th Avenue) in Pinecrest; both State Roads were cut back to US 1 by 2001.

It was recorded live on December 30 and 31, 2006, at the House of Blues in Atlantic City, New Jersey. These two shows were recorded shortly after Anastasio was arrested for drug possession earlier that month and were his final concerts before he began a drug rehabilitation program; Anastasio made a reference to the arrest during the song \\"Makisupa Policeman\\" during the December 31 show, but that song does not appear on the album. Proceeds from the sale of the album benefit the Seven Below Arts Initiative, established by Anastasio in 2006 to foster artistic development and support arts education in the state of Vermont.

Individual items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale, and then summed with two reversed items to describe co-dependency on a scale from a high of 96 to a low of 16. Scores on the codependency scale distinguished known groups; furthermore, scores correlated as expected with intrapersonal measures as well as interpersonal perceptions of parenting in the family of origin. Its creators are Judith L. Fischer PhD and Lynda Spann MS, both from the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at Texas Tech University. In a series of studies, Fischer, Spann, and Crawford (1991); Fischer and Crawford (1992); and Fischer, Wampler, Lyness, and Thomas (1992) defined co-dependency as a dysfunctional pattern of relating to others with \\"an extreme focus outside oneself, lack of open expression of feelings, and attempts to derive a sense of purpose [exclusively] through relationships\\" with others. The Spann-Fischer Scale has enjoyed good test-retest reliability ( > .80), and acceptable internal consistency (.62 < < .92), across studies. Spann-Fischer scores have been associated with membership in Codependents Anonymous, gender, self-esteem, locus of control, depression, relationship with parents, and anxiety (Fischer, Spann & Crawford, 1991); narcissism (O'Brien & Gaborit, 1992); parental co-dependency (Irwin, 1995); age (Crothers & Warren, 1996); treatment outcomes and education (Teichman & Basha, 1996); parenting style (Fischer & Crawford, 1992); powerlessness in relationships (Cowan, Bommersbach & Curtis, 1995); and risk-taking (Fischer, Wampler, Lyness & Thomas, 1992) - but not with parental chemical dependency (Crothers & Warren, 1996); the number of family addictions, the severity of dysfunction in the family-of-origin, or alcoholism (Fischer, Wampler, Lyness & Thomas, 1992); childhood trauma (Irwin, 1995); or family cohesion and adaptability (Teichman & Basha, 1996).  Rating Scale  The mean Spann-Fischer co-dependency score is approximated with a midpoint of 52.6, a \\"high\\" score of 67.2 and a \\"low\\" score of 37.3 suggested by Fischer, Spann, and Crawford (1991). No significant between-workshop differences were found for Spann-Fischer measures of co- dependency in the cases presented (F = .042, p = n.s.).CLINICAL RATING SCALE FOR CO-DEPENDENCY  Notes  References * Fischer, J., & Crawford, D.
