He was educated at Lenzie Academyian Buchan, \\"Pupil power\\", Evening Times, 19 October 1981 and Bathgate Academy. He worked for the Guardian Royal Exchange insurance company from 1956 until 1970; his broadcasting career started in 1965 on the pirate radio station Radio Scotland 242, which was closed down in 1967 under the provisions of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act. Thereafter, he joined the BBC in Glasgow, including working as a DJ on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2's Night Ride programme. He moved to Kent, England, in 1970, becoming a presenter on the Chatham-based BBC Radio Medway (now BBC Radio Kent), plus occasional broadcasts on BBC Radio 2. He also produced some programmes for BBC Radio 4, such as You and Yours. Following the launch of BBC Radio Scotland in 1978, Mack returned to Scotland in 1979, becoming presenter of the mid-morning programme (The Jimmy Mack Show), which in 1988 broadcast live from the Glasgow Garden Festival for a total of 108 consecutive outside broadcasts, a possible record for such a programme. He became well-known on television in Scotland, with programmes for the BBC as well as Grampian Television and Scotland Today for STV. In 1990, he left Radio Scotland to work for the commercial station Radio Clyde in the west of Scotland, becoming one of the station's main presenters on Clyde 2 from the launch on 3 January 1990. Jimmy presented the drivetime show for eight years and also presented a show called Relax with Mack on Sunday afternoons before moving onto presenting the early evening and weekend breakfast shows for a few years. In 2001, he launched his own Saturday night show called Saturday Night with Jimmy Mack. He was patron of the Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association. His charity work led to him being awarded the MBE in 1996. He continued to broadcast on Radio Clyde until two weeks before his death from cancer on 3 July 2004.

It is most often seen in the lower labial gingiva of tobacco users. Most easily it is found in Caucasians, due to their lack of a genetically caused melanin pigmentation.Hedin CA: Smoker's Melanosis. Occurrence and localization in the attached gingiva. Arch Dermatol 1977; 113:1533-1538. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Smokers_melanosis.jpg The brown to black colour is melanin. In skin, melanin prevents harmful UV- light from reaching deeper, sensible parts of the tissue. If UV-light penetrates deep, some of the toxic substances due to the UV-light damage to the cells, are bound to melanin in the epithelial cells and travel with the ageing cells to the skin surface, where they are expelled from the tissue surface. In this way the melanocytes and kerationocytes together protect the tissue, with melanin serving as a toxic defence and cleaning agent. In the oral mucosa, where the ageing epithelial cells move faster to the surface compared to skin, a similar defence-mechanism seems to be present, cleaning the mucosa from different toxic chemicals penetrating the epithelium. Besides chemicals in tobacco also antimalaria-drugs cause an oral pigmentation. Smoker's melanosis is like the genetic melanin pigmentations, a defence-system in action. The microscope shows smoker's melanosis to be characterized by a melanin hyperpigmentation of the lower part of the oral epithelium, similar to sun-tanned skin. The hyperpigmentation consists of melanin granules which have the shape and colour of \\"coffea beans\\". They are produced by the dendritic, octopus-like melanocytes, seen between the epithelial cells situated closest to the epithelium/connective tissue border.Hedin CA, Larsson √Ö: The ultrastructure of the gingival epithelium in smoker's melanosis. J Periodont Res 1984; 19:177-190. In tobacco-users the melanocytes are stimulated to produce melanin granules and to distribute them out to the surrounding epithelial cells for further transport to the mucosal surface, like the mechanism in melanin-pigmented skin. Small amounts of melanin-like granules together with other electron-dense particles can also be seen within large melanosome complexes in the underlying connective tissue.Hedin CA, Larsson √Ö: Large melanosome complexes in the human gingival epithelium. J Periodont Res 1987; 22:108-113. If the granules derive from the epithelium, a phenomenon known as melanin incontinence, is not known.Sapp JP, Eversole LR, Wysock GPi: Contemporary Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Chapter 6 - Epithelial Disorders. Published by Mosby,1997; St. Louis, MO. In Caucasians these granules are not expected to influence on the clinically observed degree of smoker's melanosis. Causes Smoker melanosis in a patient consuming 2 packs of cigarette per day Smoking or the use of nicotine-containing drugs is the cause to Smoker's melanosis,.Hedin CA, Larsson √Ö: In vitro activation of amphibian dermal melanocytes by nicotine. Scand J Dent Res 1986; 94:57-65.Wallstrom M, Sand L, Nilsson F, Hirsch JM: The long-term effect of nicotine on the oral mucosa. Addiction 1999; 94:417-423. Also tar-components (benzopyrenes) are known to stimulate melanocytes to melanin production, and other unknown toxic agents in tobacco may also be the cause. These chemical agents have a polycyclic, chain-like structure. Environmental tobacco smoke from parents is causing smoker's melanosis in their children Hanioka T, Tanaka K, Ojima M, Yuuki K: Association of melanin pigmentation in the gingiva of children with parents who smoke. Pediatrics 2005; 116:186-190. Swedish snuff causes a small elevation of oral melanin pigmented individuals from 3.0% to 4.7%. Nicotine tablets have shown to stimulate to melanin pigmentation of the oral mucosa. Treatment and prognosis Lesions usually disappear between 3 months to 3 years for those who stop smoking.Hedin CA, Pindborg JJ, Ax√©ll T: Depigmentation of smoker's melanosis after smoking-stop. J Oral Pathol Med 1993;22:228-230. Smoker's melanosis is a benign, normal physiological reaction, and does not develop into cancer. If it does not disappear, however, a biopsy can verify the diagnosis. If Smoker's melanosis is destroyed by excessive smoking, as in the hard palate of reverse smokers, who smoke with the glowing part of the cigarette inside the mouth for different reasons, a pale depigmented surface is first seen, indicating the loss of the protecting melanin. Then a red inflammation sometimes occurs and cancer development may follow. In reverse smokers it is important to regularly inspect the areas with Smoker's melanosis to detect any melanin destruction, in order to stop smoking in time and thus prevent a cancer to develop. Epidemiology A study in Sweden showed that 21.5% of smokers and 3% of nonsmokers (genetic pigmentation or unknown cause) had lesions that could be classified as an oral melanin pigmentation. A gingival melanin index in 4 degrees was established.Hedin CA: Smoker's Melanosis. Occurrence and localization in the attached gingiva. Arch Dermatol 1977; 113:1533-1538.Already with a consumption of 1-3 cigarettes a day 9.3% of all 20.333 examined showed a smoker's melanosis. Pipe smokers had smoker's melanosis in 16.8%. One year after the start of cigarette smoking a clinically visible smoker's melanosis could be seen in 12.3% of women, and 17% among men. In cigarette smokers who quit smoking, the number of individuals with smoker's melanosis becomes slowly less frequent after 2‚Äì3 months, but can still be seen in a few former smokers three years after smoking stop. Although clinically visible genetic melanin pigmentations in the mouth are present in several ethnic groups all over the world, more mucosal areas will be melanin- pigmentet if tobacco products are used. Smoker's melanosis is found in India,Sridharan S, Ganiger K, Satyanarayana A, Rahul A, Shetty S: Effect of environmental tobacco smoke from smoker parents on gingival pigmentation in children and young adults: a cross-sectional study.

Early life and education He was born in Wichita, Kansas on February 12, 1897 to Charles Melchior LaPaz and Emma Josephine (Strode). He earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1920 in mathematics at Fairmont College (presently Wichita State University) and also taught there between 1917 and 1920. He earned his master's degree via a scholarship at Harvard University, completed in 1922. On June 18, 1922, he married Leota Ray Butler and later had two children, Leota Jean and Mary Strode. Between 1922 and 1925 he taught at Dartmouth College. He received his Ph.D. in 1928 at the University of Chicago, where he instructed for a short time and acted as National Research Fellow. In 1930, he was assistant professor at Ohio State University and became associate professor in 1936 and finally professor in 1942, where he helped develop the graduate mathematics program. Career LaPaz took leave from Ohio State to the New Mexico Proving Ground during World War II where he was a Research Mathematician, and later as Technical Director, Operations Analysis Section, Second Air Force. This is where he became interested in ballistics as well as meteorites. His work with the Second Air Force included investigation of Japanese Fu-Go balloon bombs that had reached the United States. In 1945, he worked at the University of New Mexico where he founded the Institute of Meteoritics, of which he was Director until 1966. Between 1945 and 1953 LaPaz was Head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy. From 1953 to 1962, he served as Director of the Division of Astronomy at the university. In 1952, while serving as Director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the university, he researched the Lake Murray Meteorite.\\"Rare Meteorite Found, Exhibited In State Park.\\" Resourceful Oklahoma. Volume 3, Number 10, October,1952. Retrieved July 25, 2014. UFO investigations In ufology, LaPaz's name is often associated with UFO investigations on behalf of the military during the late 1940s and early 1950s. These include Roswell UFO incident of 1947, the N.M. green fireballs, that began in late 1948 and continued through the 1950s, and the search for near-Earth orbiting satellites in 1954 along with fellow N.M. astronomer Clyde Tombaugh. However, only LaPaz's association with the green fireball investigations for the Air Force is thoroughly documented and a historical fact. LaPaz had two known UFO sightings of his own. The first occurred with his family on July 10, 1947, only two days after the infamous Roswell UFO incident and only 70 miles north of Roswell near Fort Sumner, N.M. As reported in a LIFE magazine article on UFOs in 1952, though LaPaz was not identified at the time, \\"all four of us almost simultaneously became aware of a curious bright object almost motionless\\" among the clouds. \\"As seen projected against these dark clouds, the object gave the strongest impression of self-luminosity.\\" It \\"showed a sharp and firm regular outline, namely one of a smooth elliptical character much harder and sharper than the edges of the cloudlets... The hue of the luminous object was somewhat less white than the light of Jupiter in a dark sky, not aluminum or silver-colored.... The object clearly exhibited a sort of wobbling motion ... This wobbling motion served to set off the object as a rigid, if not solid body.\\" After remaining stationary for about 30 seconds, it then suddenly rose. \\"This remarkably sudden ascent thoroughly convinced me that we were dealing with an absolutely novel airborne device.\\"LIFE article summary His second sighting was of a green fireball, soon after he began his investigations into the phenomenon for the Air Force in December, 1948. The sighting was on December 12 and the phenomenon was also seen over Los Alamos, enabling LaPaz to perform a triangulation. This showed the object's path was directly over the very sensitive Los Alamos. In a classified letter to the Air Force on December 20, LaPaz wrote that the object moved far too slowly to have been a meteor and left no \\"trail of sparks or dust cloud\\" as would be typical of meteors flying at low altitudes. Other anomalous characteristics were the intense lime-green color, low altitude of only 8‚Äì10 miles yet exhibiting no sound, flat rather than arced trajectory, and turning on and off like a light switch. Investigating many other green fireball sightings, LaPaz reached similar conclusions and decided they were probably artificial in origin, perhaps Russian spy devices. (see green fireballs for details) LaPaz's green fireball investigations were also mentioned in the 1952 LIFE magazine article, and his wife also made a painting of a green fireball. Regarding the 1947 Roswell incident, at least three witnesses, including two involved with Army and Air Force counterintelligence, claimed that LaPaz was brought in after the Roswell UFO incident to interview witnesses and reconstruct the trajectory of the crash object.affidavit of Ed Zimmerman; other witnesses were M/Sgt. Lewis Rickett of the Army Counterintelligence Corp (CIC), who said he assisted LaPaz in the investigation of the Roswell object, and Canadian archeologist Boyd Wettlaufer, once a student of LaPaz's, who said LaPaz discussed it with him in 1950 while both were working near the Winslow meteor crater. However, UFO researcher Karl T. Pflock discovered some facts that might call into question some aspects of this testimony. For example, one of the purported witnesses to LaPaz's Roswell involvement claimed that LaPaz spoke fluent Spanish, but by interviewing family members, Pflock discovered that LaPaz did not speak any Spanish. In August 1954, a story broke in the press that Tombaugh and LaPaz, working on behalf of the Army, had found two \\"natural\\" satellites only 400 and 600 miles out that had recently come into orbit. LaPaz at first vehemently denied that he was involved in any way, and later denied that anything had been found, as did Tombaugh (see Clyde Tombaugh for details). However, the fact that Tombaugh was indeed engaged in such a search was already public knowledge from previous press releases, as was LaPaz's knowledge of the search from discussions with Tombaugh, even if he wasn't directly involved. (see newspaper photo at right, where LaPaz was shown discussing the search with Tombaugh) In 1964 LaPaz was also involved peripherally in the investigation of the famous Socorro UFO incident, in which a Socorro policeman named Lonnie Zamora saw a small egg-shaped object land, saw two humanoid figures near the object, and then when he approached to within 50 feet, the object blasted off and rapidly disappeared. LaPaz interviewed Zamora and vouched for him as a witness. LaPaz's true beliefs about the origins of UFOs are a bit muddled. Two witnesses have said that LaPaz told them he was of the opinion that the Roswell crash object was an unmanned extraterrestrial probe. The green fireballs he also felt were artificial in origin because of their anomalous characteristics. But government documents and public statements make it clear he thought they were probably Russian spy devices. (see green fireballs for details) LaPaz's last known comments on UFOs and the green fireballs occurred in 1965 during a visit by astronomer J. Allen Hynek, a consultant to the Air Force's Project Blue Book UFO investigation. Hynek was also investigating the Socorro incident. According to Hynek, LaPaz felt the fireballs were the most important part of the UFO phenomenon. He remained convinced that the fireballs' anomalous characteristics had never been adequately explained by the official investigation. LaPaz continued to think the green fireballs were artificial, but now believed the fireballs, and also the Socorro craft, to be highly secret projects of the U.S. government. He also accused Hynek, Project Blue Book, and others of being part of \\"a grand cover-up for something the government does not want discussed\\".Brad Steiger, Project Blue Book, pp. 132, 136 Notes References  Category:1897 births Category:1985 deaths Category:American astronomers Category:Dartmouth College faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Ohio State University faculty Category:People from Wichita, Kansas Category:Ufologists Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:University of New Mexico faculty Category:Wichita State University alumni ","title":"Lincoln LaPaz"},{"id":"13603611","text":"Refrigerator (1988‚Äì1999) was an Appendix Quarter Horse racehorse who won the Champions of Champions race three times.

Hapalodectids differ from the larger and better-known mesonychids in having teeth specialized for cutting (presumably meat), while the teeth of other mesonychids, such as Mesonyx or Sinonyx, are more specialized for crushing bones. Hapalodectids were once considered a subfamily of the Mesonychidae, but the discovery of a skull of Hapalodectes hetangensis showed additional differences justifying placement in a distinct family. In particular, H. hetangensis has a postorbital bar closing the back of the orbit, a feature lacking in mesonychids. The skeleton of hapalodectids is poorly known and of the postcranial elements, only the humerus has been described.

Events  Seomra Spraoi was run on a not-for-profit basis by an anti- capitalist collective of around 50 people with anarchist principles. At Belvedere Court, the building had two floors and a garden. There was a kitchen, a cinema, a computer, a library, a free shop and meeting spaces. Seomra Spraoi hosted a number of regular events such as a vegan cafe, bicycle repair workshop, gigs, free cinema and art exhibitions. Fundraisers were held for groups such as Refugee and Migrant Solidarity Ireland, and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). Queer Thing organised at the space and Auntie Underground Cinema screened screened anarchist films fortnightly. Other events included anti-authoritarian parent and child groups, anarcha-feminist meetings and a table-tennis club. From 2005 onwards, Seomra Spraoi hosted the Forgotten Zine archive, created in 2004 by Ciar√°n Walsh. It contained around 1,200 zines from both Irish and foreign authors.

Nye was drafted by the Cubs in 1966 while still at the University of California, Berkeley. Nye went to their Class A team in Caldwell, Idaho for a brief \\"spring training\\" and 3 weeks of action before being called up to the California Class A league to finish that minor league season; Chicago brought him to the majors in 1966 at the end of the season. Nye received a degree in civil engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in the same year he was drafted. He played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Montreal Expos, and Chicago Cubs. Nye was with the Cubs during the years Leo Durocher was manager and recalled learning when he was scheduled to pitch not from Durocher, but by reading the sports column. He was named Chicago's Rookie of the Year in 1968. Nye played in the major leagues for over five years; his baseball career came to an end due to injuries. Upon retiring, Rich initially used his civil engineering degree, working for a time on what was to become the Willis Tower and became a commodities trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Rich Nye in 1968 A teammate of his with the 1971 Winnipeg Whips, Triple A affiliate of the Montreal Expos, was the father of major leaguer John Olerud, who was in medical school while playing baseball. Looking for something that would be as inspirational to him as baseball was, the two discussed the possibilities and Nye learned he needed some undergraduate science credits to be a candidate for the University of Illinois' veterinary program. He entered the University of Illinois School of Veterinary Medicine in 1972, becoming a veterinarian in 1976. He began practicing medicine at Niles Animal Hospital in Niles, Illinois. Nye developed a special interest in birds while at the practice and became an exotic and avian specialist. When the Association of Avian Veterinarians was founded in 1980, he became a charter member and is also a past president of AAV (1989). Using his abilities in commodity trading to earn the money for starting his own practice, Nye and two other exotic animal veterinarians founded Midwest Bird and Exotic Animal Hospital in Westchester, Illinois in 1985, which was the first exotic-only specialist practice in the United States. Nye and Dr. Susan Brown, a partner and the inspiration for starting the all-exotic practice, were married. Their practice grew to include five veterinarians and a large support staff; almost 20 years after the founding of the hospital, the couple sold it to two veterinarians on their staff in October 2004. The practice that Nye and Brown started outgrew its original home in Westchester; in 2005, it moved to its present location in Elmwood Park, Illinois. He is the author of several veterinary textbook chapters on avian medicine, serves as a consultant, and has continued to see patients at Ness Exotic Wellness Center in Lisle, Illinois on a part-time basis.

Formed in 2005, it is the principal accreditation for hospitals in India. Overview Organisations like the Quality Council of India (QCI) and its National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers have designed an exhaustive healthcare standard for hospitals and healthcare providers. This standard consists of stringent 600 plus objective elements for the hospital to achieve in order to get the NABH accreditation. These standards are divided between patient centered standards and organization centred standards. To comply with these standard elements, the hospital will need to have a process-driven approach in all aspects of hospital activities ‚Äì from registration, admission, pre- surgery, peri-surgery and post-surgery protocols, discharge from the hospital to follow up with the hospital after discharge. Not only the clinical aspects but the governance aspects are to process driven based on clear and transparent policies and protocols. In a nutshell, NABH aims at streamlining the entire operations of a hospital. NABH is equivalent to JCI and other International standards including HAS: Haute Authorite de Sante, Australian Council on Healthcare Standards, the Japan Council for Quality in Health Care and the National Committee for Quality Assurance in the United States. Its standards have been accredited by ISQUA the apex body accrediting the accreditators hence making NABH accreditation at par with the world's most leading hospital accreditation. The official website of QCI should be referred for application and implementation of healthcare standards. The Quality Council of India works under the guidance of Ministry of Commerce. History NABH accreditation system was established in 2006 as a constituent of Quality Council of India (QCI). The first edition of standards was released in 2006 and after that the standards has been revised every 3 years. Currently the 4th edition of NABH standards, released in December 2015 is in use. The first hospital to be accredited by NABH is 'Malabar Institute of Medical Sciences (MIMS), Kerala' which is a 650-bed multispeciality hospital and was accredited in 2007 and till date more than 350 hospitals in India has achieved accreditation by NABH. In public hospitals, Gandhinagar General hospital was the first to get NABH accreditation in 2009.

It has several historical sites, including the Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple, the triangular Chanda Bhairab Temple, the five-domed Tenga Mosque, and a Hammamkhana built in the late sixteenth century by Maharaja Pratapaditya.  History  Once the capital of Raja Bikramaditya and Maharaja Pratapaditya was at Dhumghat. Later it was transferred to Ishwaripur. It was the capital city from 1590-1610. The first Catholic Church of Bengal was built in Ishwaripur in 1599. The Portuguese soldiers of Pratapaditya initiated the building process of the church. After the fall of Pratapaditya the area surrounding Iswaripur emerged as forest and people started going away from the area. The Mughal Foujders and the Jamiders also retreated from the area. Then there was no worship in the Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple. Eventually, the area was used by local robbers as a hiding place. The robbers worshiped the goddess Kali at that time. After some hundred years, somehow people from other villages came and worshiped the goddess. As the days past, there was a village situated surrounding the Temple. This village was known as Jessoreshwaripur, now known as Ishwaripur. The village has a long heritage of social harmony. The Kali Temple, the catholic Church and the Tenga Mosque played an important role for the said harmonious relationship of the people of the village. In 1919, at the time of British rule, a post office (Ishwaripur Post Office) was placed in the village.  Geography  Ishwaripur is located south of Satkhira Sadar. It has an area of and is bounded by Kaliganj and Assasuni upazilas on the north, the Sundarbans on the south, Koyra and Assasuni upazilas on the east, West Bengal of India on the west. The village is situated on the bank of Ichamati River (now known as Kadamtali Canal). Demographics  According to the 2011 Bangladesh census, Ishwaripur had 781 households and a population of 3,323. The literacy rate (age 7 and over) was 49.2%, compared to the national average of 51.8%. The population is 94% Muslim and 6% Hindu.

Description This extinct Urania species was black with iridescent red, blue and green markings. The iridescent parts of the wings do not have pigment; as determined by optical analysis on the species Urania fulgens belonging to the same genus.Prum, R.O. Quinn T. & Torres, R.H. (2006). \\"Anatomically diverse butterfly scales all produce structural colours by coherent scattering\\". The Journal of Experimental Biology. 209, 748-765 The color originates from refraction of light by the ribbon-like scales covering the moth's wings. Urania sloanus is considered \\"the most spectacular Urania species\\". As most species of the subfamily Uraniinae, it was a day-flying moth while most moths are active at night; its bright colors advertised, as a warning, the fact that it was also toxic. { - valign=\\"top\\" Urania sloanus as illustrated in A Handbook to the Order Lepidoptera by W. F. Kirby Illustration from Pieter Cramer and Caspar Stoll's De uitlandsche kapellen: voorkomende in de drie waereld-deelen Asia, Africa en America } Extinction Based on current knowledge of extant uraniine species, it is likely that Sloane's urania migrated between patches of host plants, after population explosions locally defoliated them. This probably required relatively large, intact areas of lowland forest.(2004) Urania sloanus in The Titian Peale Butterfly and Moth Collection of The Academy of Natural Sciences. Retrieved October 6, 2007. Habitat loss when Jamaica's lowland rainforests were cleared and converted to agricultural land during the colonial era may have contributed to its extinction, although large parts of primary forest still remain. Thus, the more probable answer to its extinction would be that the moth population \\"crashed below a sustainable level, perhaps a victim of loss of one of its larval foodplants\\" such as the toxic Omphalea triandra and O. diandra. Like other members of the genus Urania, periodic swarms of moths were separated by years of great scarcity.

One component of their language is the use of idioms. The validity of these idioms have often been questioned or confused with metaphorical language. The term idiom can be defined as, \\"A speech form or an expression of a given language that is peculiar to itself grammatically or cannot be understood from the individual meanings of its elements,\\" (Idiom, 2007). The following examples are written in ASL glossing. These idioms further validate ASL as a language unique and independent of English. Idioms in ASL bond people in the Deaf community because they are expressions that only in-group members can understand.  Examples  \\"Train go sorry\\" is one of the most widely used idioms and is similar to the English idiom You missed the boat.Cohen, 1995 Another variation of this idiom is \\"Cigarette- gone\\".Vicars, 2005 \\"Cow-it\\" is roughly translated into I don't care for [something].Schmidt, 2007 \\"I-I-I,\\" the letter, not \\"me,\\" signed repeatedly with alternating hands on the chest is an idiom that is translated into the English word egotistical.Duncan et al. However, even examples like \\"Cow-it\\" and \\"I-I-I\\" remain controversial. There is ambiguity in defining and identifying idioms in American Sign Language as little is known of ASL's use of idioms. Cokely & Baker-Shenk write, \\"it is interesting to note that ASL seems to have very few widely-used idioms, according to the standard definition of ‚Äòidiom.‚Äô\\"Cokley & Baker-Shenk, 1980: 119 In their examination of how interpreters approach ASL idioms Santiago and Barrick (2007) cite Rosenthal's (1978) definition of idiom to frame their research: \\"1. Idioms consist of at least two or more words, which may or may not be contiguous, inflected or in a specific order. 2. Idioms are recurrent constructs...(Some degree of recurrence is necessary to distinguish idioms from metaphors and other style figures).\\"Rosenthal, 1978: 1 This is important because some constructs like \\"Cow-it\\" and \\"Cigarette-gone\\" may not have the incidence of recurrence needed to be considered ASL idioms. Some authors have noticed that many signs that people often think are idioms in ASL i.e., \\"Out of sight,\\" \\"On the fence,\\" \\"Funny None/Funny Zero,\\" are either sign compounds with transparent meaning (\\"Funny none\\" means \\"not funny\\") or single-sense lexical items that either cannot be translated into English by using a single lexical item, or whose translation requires an English idiom. According to Battison in Valli and Lucas 1998, \\"We can show that things that are often called sign ‚Äòidioms‚Äô: are often just ordinary signs that are difficult to translate into English.\\"Battison, 1998, p. 225 When compared to the sign \\"Succeed,\\" which is made with two movements, the sign \\"At last\\" is one sharp movement and has historically been called an ASL idiom for the very reason of its non- translatability. But Battison purports that because the \\"two signs are made differently (they) have different meanings...they are two separate signs.\\" By \\"misusing\\" the term idiom in application to American Sign Language, the result is an \\"obscure\\" understanding of how \\"the language really works and it make(s) it seem as if the language is unstructured and simple. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.\\"Battison 1998, p. 225 See also * Profanity in ASL Citations  References  * Cohen, L. (1995). Train Go Sorry.

Recently, however, the Spring 2011 issue of The Baum Bugle featured articles discussing his life, career, and work. Snow notes that Kramer was born in New York City and lived in Brooklyn, and was a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers, living as modestly as a \\"typical\\" (Snow's quotation marks) business man. He had indeed been a business man, but gave it up to become a freelance artist.

Since then, several more disciplines have been added. It was founded in 1983. It is currently headquartered in Gurnee, Illinois, United States. The NSBA has a partnership with the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) in order that both associations can benefit from the many rules and regulations they have in common.  History  There was a long period of chaos with all the involved parties of pleasure riding meeting in various places and attempting to improve the sport, while a few good men complained on the sidelines. Then these few decide to its time to take a big risk to do something exceptional for the horse. Knowing that it is a long-term endeavor, these men take a leap of faith and meet in Dallas, Texas, to shape a plan in detail. The result was the National Snaffle Bit Association. It started with donations gathered from the most active, mostly trainers, riders, and owners. With the funds collected, they used it as seed money; thus the NSBA was founded in 1983. Many members can rightfully claim credit for getting the association started. But a handful were crucial - Leo Barbera, Walter Hughes, Jerry Stanford, and Jack Benson are some. These cowboys were intent on promoting gentler training methods, more authentic gaits, and longevity in show horses. They helped to protect the horse and ensured a lasting future for the show horse. One of the changes was to have trainers stop pressuring the two-years old to have them ready to show bridles in the summer. Rather, they wanted them shown in snaffle bits. \\"We first formed the National Pleasure Horse Association but it didn‚Äôt quite have the leadership that was needed to get off the ground,\\" says trainer and judge Brad Gibby, who was there from the very beginning when NSBA was formed. \\"That‚Äôs when we came together again and our vision for NSBA was for it to be a place to market our western pleasure horses and for us to slow down a bit and not push the horses as much as we had in the past.\\" There was quite a bit of adjustment after the switch. When the NASB first started, it was a Western Pleasure based association only. When they welcomed June Warren onto the Board in 1986, she advocated for the hunter under saddle horse. Not long after, she had lassoed cowboys and a hunter under saddle division was born. And for every addition to Western pleasure, she made sure a commensurate addition was made for hunter horses. The association continued to grow with a Stallion Incentive Fund (SIF) and then a Breeders Championship Futurity (BCF). A new program was added for rail horses. The BCF was expanded to include trail and western riding. The show transitioned to the NSBA World Championship Show. The NASB says it is a combination of programs and people that has made their association so successful.  Organization  = Hall of Fame = The National Snaffle Bit Association Hall of Fame was created to recognize extraordinary athletes, individuals, riders, and horses in the equestrian sport of Pleasure riding. These inductees are tracked in a separate article. = World Show = The World Show is several days of pleasure horse classes and special events.

Liang Heng was born in Changsha, Hunan Province. He led a difficult life as a child, dealing with hardships of the Cultural Revolution, Party Bureaucracy, and poverty. In 1983, Son of the Revolution, his account of his experiences growing up in communist China during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, written with his wife Judith Shapiro, was published.Wakeman, Carolyn. THE LITTLE RED BOOK AND THE BOTTOM LINE. The New York Times. June 22, 1986. He was the sole son born to a reporter and a police bureaucrat. At first he and his two elder sisters were assured a place in China's communist system - their parents were well placed, and all were fervent believers in Mao Zedong, also known as Mao Tse-tung. The Liangs' fortunes turned during the Hundred Flowers Campaign. At the outset of the campaign, loyal communists were encouraged to find faults in the existing regime, in an effort to purify communism. Unfortunately for those involved, the campaign was quickly replaced with an \\"anti-rightist\\" campaign leading in an opposite direction of the Hundred Flowers Campaign. This new campaign targeted as enemies many who had criticized the party in compliance with the Hundred Flowers Campaign - a group that included Liang Heng's mother, who was banished from her lofty position and sent to a re-education camp. Liang Heng's father reluctantly separated from his now disgraced wife in order to spare his family the \\"black mark\\" of having a \\"rightist\\" mother. The effort proved wasted, as the family bore the brunt of the nation's growing revolutionary fervor. Liang Heng's father was labeled a counter-revolutionary intellectual, and he himself a \\"stinking intellectual's son\\". Despite the family's hope to stay together, the Cultural Revolution saw them banished to distant corners of China. Heng stayed with his father, who remained a stalwart believer in Mao, even as they (and many like them) were forced to leave their privileged lives as city dwellers to become country peasants. In Son of the Revolution, Liang chronicled his participation in a Changsha street gang when his parents were sent to cadre schools. Eventually, the fervor of the cultural revolution lead to outright warfare fought by competing cadres using weapons they didn't understand. Eventually, the fighting came to an end, leaving the Chinese in an uneasy peace. Rather than revolutionary zeal, an older Liang Heng found a new danger in China's bribery economy. He became a factory worker and then a star basketball player. When China signaled that it would reopen schools, Liang Heng jumped at the chance for a university education. During his studies at the Hunan Teachers' College in Changsha he met Judith Shapiro, an American teacher. In 1980, they married. Liang Heng emigrated with his wife to the United States in the early 1980s. Liang Heng was portrayed by Robin Shou in the 1990 TV drama film Forbidden Nights. He and his wife Judith Shapiro also co-authored After the Nightmare (Knopf, 1987) and Cold Winds, Warm Winds (Wesleyan University Press, 1987). In 1991 the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Liang and Shapiro had divorced. http://articles.philly.com/1991-11-17/news/25771114_1_china-shapiro-people-s- republic Bibliography * References Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Writers from Changsha ","title":"Liang Heng"},{"id":"13604535","text":"Jan Stanis≈Çaw Bystro≈Ñ.

In the main event, Zayn defeated Adrian Neville to win the NXT Championship. After a long celebration with the roster, Owens turned on Zayn, delivering a powerbomb on the apron and re- igniting their feud. On February 11, 2015 at NXT TakeOver: Rival, Owens won the title from Zayn via ref stoppage after continuously powerbombing Zayn. In May 2015, Owens was brought up to the main roster, followed by Zayn the following year.

Following Clash of Champions, Owens and Zayn would embark on a feud with WWE Champion AJ Styles, facing him at Royal Rumble in a Handicap Match and at Fastlane in a six-pack challenge, also including Baron Corbin, Dolph Ziggler, and John Cena, failing both times. During the Fastlane match, Owens and Zayn's rivalry with Shane McMahon intensified when Shane, who was sitting at ringside, constantly interfered and broke up pinfalls attempted by both Owens and Zayn. This led to a match at WrestleMania 34 against the team of Shane McMahon and the SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan, who made his in-ring return after years of retirement. At the event, Zayn submitted to Bryan's Yes! Lock. After they lost, they joined RAW, where they wrestled several tag team matches until Money in the Bank. After the event, it was reported that Zayn had to undergo surgery to fix torn rotator cuffs on his knee and shoulder, thus splitting the team and Owens was also reported to undergo knee surgery as well. On the June 4, 2019 episode of SmackDown Live, Owens and Zayn would reunite to face The New Day in a losing effort. At Stomping Grounds, they defeated The New Day.

He returned in June with John Hamilton, abbot of Paisley, in time to assist Cardinal Beaton's opposition to the English matrimonial schemes of the English court. In 1543 he became secretary to James V. The letters of the English ambassadors, preserved in Sadler's Papers, and George Buchanan's bitter criticism testify to the strength of his influence on behalf of France. In December he was ordered by the governor to deliver back, according to custom, the badge of knighthood of the Golden Fleece to the Emperor Charles V. In 1545 he became bishop of Ross, and in May of that year was sent on a mission to the king of France, the Emperor, and Mary of Hungary. He was abroad for seven years. On his return, in 1552, he received consecration to his bishopric at Jedburgh, before a brilliant assembly of the Scottish nobles. He died, according to Holinshed, at Stirling on 1 October 1558, and was succeeded in the bishopric by Henry Sinclair.

The film stars Evelyn Ankers, J. Carrol Naish, Samuel S. Hinds, Lois Collier, Milburn Stone, and Douglass Dumbrille. The film involves Dr. Carl Fletcher who is in court on the murder of Paula Dupree, who he explains has the ability to turn into an Ape Woman. Jungle Woman was the second film in Universal's \\"Cheena, the Ape Woman\\" series, preceded by Captive Wild Woman. It was shot in a short period with LeBorg claiming 7 days while production documents claim were 10 days. It would be the last film for actress Acquanetta in the role of the Ape Woman as she would leave Universal before the next film in the series, The Jungle Captive. Contemporary reviews of the film commented on the acting and overall quality of the plot, while retrospective reviews from the book Universal Horrors and AllMovie have called it among the worst of the Universal horror films. Plot As a coroner and a District Attorney investigate the death of Paula Dupree, which Dr. Carl Fletcher admits that he has murdered. He expands on this death, revealing more information on the story. Through a flashback, Fletcher is at an opening night of the Whipple Circus and witnessed Cheela the Gorilla's heroic act that saved the life of Fred Mason. After her supposed demise, the doctor acquires the body of the beast. He detects a heartbeat, and revives the animal. Fascinated by the creature, he purchases the late Dr. Walters‚Äô estate, hoping to find the records of his experiments. Cheela returns to human form. She is at first unable to speak and Fletcher diagnoses her condition as being due to shock. Upon the arrival of his daughter Joan and her fianc√© Bob Whitney, the girl suddenly becomes verbal identifying herself as Paula. Enamored with Bob, Paula's jealous streak resurfaces. During a moonlight canoe ride, an unseen attacker capsizes Joan and Bob. Discussing the episode with Dr. Fletcher, they believe that one of the other patients Willie is responsible. Willie is then discovered to be missing. Paula later meets with Bob in private, showing him bruises on her shoulder, injuries she claims were inflicted by Dr. Fletcher. Meanwhile, the caretaker for the estate has made the doctor aware of the vicious killing of his dog and a flock of chickens. Armed with the broken lock to the henhouse, Dr. Fletcher confiscates Paula's perfume bottle as well. After he returns to his study, Paula makes an attempt on his life. Just as he pushes her to the floor, Bob enters the room. Misunderstanding what he has seen, he takes Paula to another doctor for an examination. Dr. Fletcher has the lock and perfume bottle analyzed by a fingerprint expert, learning that although different in size, the prints do indeed match. He is now convinced that Paula and Cheela are one and the same. Bob has Paula examined by Dr. Meredith (Pierre Watkin), who does detect mental instability and extreme physical strength. When told she is already under the care of a doctor, he admonishes the young man to return her at once to her attending physician. Arriving back at Crestview, Dr. Fletcher is met with the news that Willie's mangled body has been found. He confides in Joan what he knows about Paula, and expresses his concern for Bob. Paula and Bob return as well, and the latter finally tells her that he is going to marry Joan, which visibly angers her. Joan rushes to meet him as Paula disappears in the shadows. Learning the truth about the girl, he sends his fianc√©e to her cabin while he goes to the aid of Dr. Fletcher. After a search of Paula's room fails, Dr. Fletcher tells Bob to check the rest of the house. Brandishing a hypodermic needle filled with a sedative, the physician heads outside to continue his search. Paula pursues Joan through the woods to the cottage. Attempting to gain entrance, she hears the approaching Dr. Fletcher. She attacks him, and in the struggle, he accidentally administers a fatal overdose. The flashbacks conclude and the D.A. expresses his disbelief. The Coroner parades the group, including the jury, to the morgue to re-examine the body of Paula Dupree. She is found to have reverted in death to the form of a half-human, half-ape monster. Dr. Fletcher is exonerated. Cast Cast is sourced from the book Universal Horrors. Production The film was originally titled Jungle Queen and had issues with its script as the Breen Office cited the script Edward Dein as being \\"unacceptable under the provisions of the Production Code by reason of a flavor of bestiality.\\" This led to a meeting between the Breen Office, executive producer Will Cowan and Maurice Pivar was set up to tone down the more lurid implications of the screenplay. The script changes included having the character the District Attorney to not be undignified or unsympathetic and that the script made it clear that Paula Dupree was not nude when changing from her animal form to her human form. Director Reginald LeBorg stated that the film had \\"an atrocious script and a silly idea anyway. But again, I was under contract. If I had refused it. I would have been suspended without pay, and I wouldn't have gotten anything any more. You had to play ball with the Front Office.\\" The authors of the book Universal Horrors stated the film was a \\"disguised attempt\\" to rewrite Cat People with a woman turning into an Ape instead of a leopard when she is sexually aroused. LeBorg commented that taking a more psychological approach to the film was \\"the only way to make the script palatable. I tried that especially because I think you have suspense that way [...] the story was so bad, I felt I had to do something\\". The film re-creates the stalking sequence from Cat People with Simone Simon stalking Jane Randolph's character down a New York street. Acquanetta spoke about her role in the film stating she did the film as she was \\"assigned to it. But once I accepted it, I did it to the best of my ability. It made money because Acquanetta as in it. I came to realize that I was the property, not the film. That's why I left Universal. I felt that I was being used.\\" She recalled that Universal \\"never forgave her\\" for leaving as they had more films in the series in mind. Filming began on February 14, 1944 at Pollard Lake for pre-production with Acquanetta. In an interview in 1984 about the film, Edward Dein didn't recall much about the production of the film, but stated that \\"We always used old sets from other films. These jungle pictures and horror films were exploitable, so we did them. Sixty minutes was about right for a B film because they were used as filler, like newsreel.\\" LeBorg recalled that the film was made in one week, and that most of these films were made in ten days. Studio papers indicate the film took the full 12 days to shoot. Release Jungle Woman was released on July 7, 1944 where it was distributed by the Universal Pictures Company. It was followed by the sequel The Jungle Captive. Jungle Woman was for released on blu ray by Scream Factory on June 16, 2020 as the fifth volume in their Universal Horror Collection, along with Captive Wild Woman, The Monster and the Girl and The Jungle Captive. Reception From contemporary reviews, \\"Char.\\" of Variety commented on the cast noting J. Carrol Naish had his \\"usual steady performance\\" while Samuel S. Hinds, Milburn Stone, Douglass Dumbrille, Lois Collier and Richard Davis were suitable. Frank Quinn of New York Daily Mirror found that the \\"story is told reasonably enough\\" and that \\"Naish turns in the most convincing performance as the puzzled medico.\\" Kate Cameron of the New York Daily News referred to the film as a \\"sequel on the economic scale\\" noting the use of old footage and that Acquanetta acted with \\"a stilted air, while the other members of the cast go through their parts [...] with assurance, trying to give the absurd story a semblance of reality.\\" The New York World-Telegram commented that \\"After Jungle Woman is over you may have furtive desire to turn yourself into a gorilla just once - and wreck the theater.\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times declared that Universal cloaked the film with \\"a balther of scientific bunk..... What's Universal doing to us - trying to make monkeys of us all?\\" From retrospective reviews, the authors of the book Universal Horrors stated that after spending its most excited sequence at the beginning, the film \\"quickly descends into unrelieved tedium.\\" and that Jungle Woman was a \\"a chore to sit through even for hardcore Universal horror buffs\\" and is \\"often cited as among the worst, if not the worst of Universal's horror movies.\\" Hans J. Stoll of AllMovie echoed this statement, stating it was a \\"strong contender for the title of Universal's worst horror film of the 1940s\\" noting that the film contained \\"seemingly endless \\"flashback\\" footage.\\" and \\"some notoriously rotten acting.\\" References =Footnotes= =Sources=  External links  Category:1944 films Category:1944 horror films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American films Category:American black- and-white films Category:English-language films Category:1940s science fiction horror films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films directed by Reginald Le Borg Category:Jungle girls Category:Films about apes ","title":"Jungle Woman"},{"id":"13604900","text":"The first slave auction in New Amsterdam in 1655, painted by Howard Pyle, 1917 The systematic enslavement of African people in the United States began in New York as part of the Dutch slave trade. The Dutch West India Company imported eleven African slaves to New Amsterdam in 1626, with the first slave auction held in New Amsterdam in 1655. With the second-highest proportion of any city in the colonies (after Charleston, South Carolina), more than 42% of New York City households held slaves by 1703, often as domestic servants and laborers. Others worked as artisans or in shipping and various trades in the city. Slaves were also used in farming on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley, as well as the Mohawk Valley region. During the American Revolutionary War, the British troops occupied New York City in 1776. The Crown promised freedom to slaves who left rebel masters, and thousands moved to the city for refuge with the British. By 1780, 10,000 black people lived in New York. Many were slaves who had escaped from their slaveholders in both northern and southern colonies. After the war, the British evacuated about 3,000 slaves from New York, taking most of them to resettle as free people in Nova Scotia, where they are known as Black Loyalists. Of the northern states, New York was next to last in abolishing slavery. (In New Jersey, mandatory, unpaid \\"apprenticeships\\" did not end until the Thirteenth Amendment ended slavery, in 1865.) After the American Revolution, the New York Manumission Society was founded in 1785 to work for the abolition of slavery and to aid free blacks. The state passed a 1799 law for gradual abolition, a law which freed no living slave. After that date, children born to slave mothers were required to work for the mother's master as indentured servants until age 28 (men) and 25 (women). The last slaves were freed on July 4, 1827 (28 years after 1799). Blacks celebrated with a parade. Dutch rule =Initial group of slaves= Systematic slavery began in 1626 in the present-day state of New York, when eleven captive Africans arrived on a Dutch West India Company ship in the New Amsterdam harbor. Historian Ira Berlin called them Atlantic Creoles who had European and African ancestry and spoke many languages. In some cases, they attained their European heritage in Africa when European traders mated with African women. Some were Africans who were crew members on ships and some came from ports of the Americas. Their first names‚Äîlike Paul, Simon, and John‚Äîindicated if they had European heritage. Their last names indicated where they came from, like Portuguese, d'Congo, or d'Angola. People from the Congo or Angola were known for their mechanical skills and docile manners. Six slaves had names that indicated a connection with New Amsterdam, such as Manuel Gerritsen, which he likely received after their arrival in New Amsterdam and to differentiate from repeated first names. Men were laborers who worked the fields, built forts and roads, and performed other forms of labor. According to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem adopted from southern colonies, children born to enslaved women were considered born into slavery, regardless of the ethnicity or status of the father. A 1798 watercolor of Fresh Water Pond. Bayard's Mount, a hillock, is in the left foreground. Prior to being levelled around 1811 it was located near the current intersection of Mott and Grand Streets. New York City, which then extended to a stockade which ran approximately north‚Äìsoutheast from today's Chambers Street and Broadway, is visible beyond the southern shore. In February 1644, the eleven slaves petitioned Willem Kieft, the director general for the colony, for their freedom. This occurred during a time where there were skirmishes with Native American people and the Dutch wanted blacks to help protect their settlements and did not want the slaves to join the Native Americans. These eleven slaves were granted partial freedom, where they could buy land and a home and earn a wage from their master, and then full freedom. Their children remained in slavery. By 1664, the original eleven slaves, as well as other slaves who had attained half-freedom, for a total of at least 30 black landowners, lived on Manhattan near the Fresh Water Pond. =Slave trade= For more than two decades after the first shipment, the Dutch West India Company was dominant in the importation of slaves from the coasts of Africa. A number of slaves were imported directly from the company's stations in Angola to New Netherlands. Due to a lack of workers in the colony, it relied upon on African slaves, who were described by the Dutch as \\"proud and treacherous\\", a stereotype for African-born slaves. The Dutch West India Company allowed New Netherlanders to trade slaves from Angola for \\"seasoned\\" African slaves from the Dutch West Indies, particularly Cura√ßao, who sold for more than other slaves. They also bought slaves that came from privateers of Spanish slave ships. For instance, La Garce a French privateer, arrived in New Amsterdam in 1642 with Spanish Negroes that were captured from a Spanish ship. Although they claimed to be free, and not African, the Dutch sold them as slaves due to their skin color. Slaves in the north were often owned by notable people like Benjamin Franklin, William Penn and John Hancock. In New Amsterdam, William Henry Seward grew up in a slave-owning family. Against slavery, he became Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State during the Civil War. Unique to slaves from other colonies, slaves could sue another person whether white or black. Early instances included suits filed for lost wages and damages when a slave's dog was injured by a white man's dog. Slaves could also be sued. =Partial and full freedom= By 1644, some slaves had earned partial freedom, or half-freedom, in New Amsterdam and were able to earn wages. They had other rights in the commercial economy, and intermarriage with working-class whites was frequent. Land grant records show that Land of the Blacks was located just north of New Amsterdam. As the English began to seize New Amsterdam in 1664, the Dutch freed a about 40 men and women who had been granted half-slave status, to ensure that the English would not keep them enslaved. The new freemen had their original land grants finalized and all grants were officially marked as being owned by the new freemen.Peter R. Christoph, \\"Freedmen of New Amsterdam\\", Selected Rensselaerwicjk Papers, New York State Library, 1991 English rule Jacob van Meurs, Novum Amsterodamum , 1671. In the centre of the picture a man is depicted hanging by his middle, suspended by a hook in his ribs and swung to and fro. In 1664, the English took over New Amsterdam and the colony. They continued to import slaves to support the work needed. Enslaved Africans performed a wide variety of skilled and unskilled jobs, mostly in the burgeoning port city and surrounding agricultural areas. In 1703, more than 42% of New York City's households held slaves, a percentage higher than in the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, and second only to Charleston in the South. In 1708, the New York Colonial Assembly passed a law entitled \\"Act for Preventing the Conspiracy of Slaves\\" which prescribed a death sentence for any slave who murdered or attempted to murder his or her master. This law, one of the first of its kind in Colonial America, was in part a reaction to the murder of William Hallet III and his family in Newtown (Queens).Wolfe, Missy. Insubordinate Spirit: A True Story of Life and Loss in Earliest America 1610-1665. Guilford CT, 2012, pp. 192‚Äì194. In 1711, a formal slave market was established at the end of Wall Street on the East River, and it operated until 1762.Philip, Abby. \\"A permanent reminder of Wall Street‚Äôs hidden slave-trading past is coming soon\\", Washington Post, April 15, 2015, retrieved February 10, 2017. An act of the New York General Assembly, passed in 1730, provided that: > Forasmuch as the number of slaves in the cities of New York and Albany, as > also within the several counties, towns and manors within this colony, doth > daily increase, and that they have oftentimes been guilty of confederating > together in running away, and of other ill and dangerous practices, be it > therefore unlawful for above three slaves to meet together at any time, nor > at any other place, than when it shall happen they meet in some servile > employment for their masters' or mistresses' profit, and by their masters' > or mistresses' consent, upon penalty of being whipped upon the naked back, > at the discretion of any one justice of the peace, not exceeding forty > lashes for each offense. Manors and towns could appoint a common whipper at no more than three shillings per person. Blacks were given the lowest status jobs, the ones the Dutch did not want to perform, like meting out corporal punishment and executions. 1741 slave insurrection. As in other slaveholding societies, the city was swept by periodic fears of slave revolt. Incidents were misinterpreted under such conditions. In what was called the New York Conspiracy of 1741, city officials believed a revolt had started. Over weeks, they arrested more than 150 slaves and 20 white men, trying and executing several, in the belief they had planned a revolt. Historian Jill Lepore believes whites unjustly accused and executed many blacks in this event.Lepore, Jill, New York Burning; Liberty, Slavery, and Conspiracy in Eighteenth-Century Manhattan, 2005. In 1753, the Assembly provided there should be paid \\"for every negro, mulatto or other slave, of four years old and upwards, imported directly from Africa, five ounces of Sevil[le] Pillar or Mexico plate [silver], or forty shillings in bills of credit made current in this colony.\\" American Revolution Runaway slave advertisement (1774). African Americans fought on both sides in the American Revolution. Many slaves chose to fight for the British, as they were promised freedom by General Guy Carleton in exchange for their service. After the British occupied New York City in 1776, slaves escaped to their lines for freedom. The black population in New York grew to 10,000 by 1780, and the city became a center of free blacks in North America. The fugitives included Deborah Squash and her husband Harvey, slaves of George Washington, who escaped from his plantation in Virginia and reached freedom in New York. In 1781, the state of New York offered slaveholders a financial incentive to assign their slaves to the military, with the promise of freedom at war's end for the slaves. In 1783, black men made up one-quarter of the rebel militia in White Plains, who were to march to Yorktown, Virginia for the last engagements. By the Treaty of Paris (1783), the United States required that all American property, including slaves, be left in place, but General Guy Carleton followed through on his commitment to the freedmen. When the British evacuated from New York, they transported 3,000 Black Loyalists on ships to Nova Scotia (now Maritime Canada), as recorded in the Book of Negroes at the National Archives of Great Britain and the Black Loyalists Directory at the National Archives at Washington. With British support, in 1792 a large group of these Black Britons left Nova Scotia to create an independent colony in Sierra Leone. Gradual abolition In 1781, the state legislature voted to free those slaves who had fought for three years with the rebels or were regularly discharged during the Revolution. The New York Manumission Society was founded in 1785, and worked to prohibit the international slave trade and to achieve abolition. It established the African Free School in New York City, the first formal educational institution for blacks in North America. It served both free and slave children. The school expanded to seven locations and produced some of its students advanced to higher education and careers. These included James McCune Smith, who gained his medical degree with honors at the University of Glasgow after being denied admittance to two New York colleges. He returned to practice in New York and also published numerous articles in medical and other journals. By 1790, one in three blacks in New York state were free. Especially in areas of concentrated population, such as New York City, they organized as an independent community, with their own churches, benevolent and civic organizations, and businesses that catered to their interests. Although there was movement towards abolition of slavery, the legislature took steps to characterize indentured servitude for blacks in a way that redefined slavery in the state. Slavery was important economically, both in New York City and in agricultural areas, such as Brooklyn. In 1799, the legislature passed the Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery. It freed no living slave. It declared children of slaves born after July 4, 1799, to be legally free, but the children had to serve an extended period of indentured servitude: to the age of 28 for males and to 25 for females. Slaves born before that date were redefined as indentured servants and could not be sold, but they had to continue their unpaid labor. From 1800 to 1827, white and black abolitionists worked to end slavery and attain full citizenship in New York. During this time, there was a rise in white supremacy, which was at odds with the increased anti-slavery efforts of the early 19th century. Peter Williams Jr., an influential black abolitionist and minister, encouraged other blacks to \\"by a strict obedience and respect to the laws of the land, form an invulnerable bulwark against the shafts of malice\\" to better the chances of freedom and a better life. African-Americans' participation as soldiers in defending the state during the War of 1812 added to public support for their full rights to freedom. In 1817, the state freed all slaves born before July 4, 1799 (the date of the gradual abolition law), to be effective in 1827. It continued with the indenture of children born to slave mothers until their 20s, as noted above. Because of the gradual abolition laws, there were children still bound in apprenticeships when their parents were free.Harris, Leslie M. In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City, 1626‚Äì1863. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003: 93‚Äì95. This encouraged African-American anti-slavery activists. On July 5, 1827, the African-American community celebrated final emancipation in the state with a parade through New York City. July 5 was chosen over July 4, because the national holiday was not meant for blacks, as Frederick Douglass stated in his famous What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July? speech of July 5, 1852. Right to vote New York residents were less willing to give blacks equal voting rights. By the constitution of 1777, voting was restricted to free men who could satisfy certain property requirements for value of real estate. This property requirement disfranchised poor men among both blacks and whites. The reformed Constitution of 1821 eliminated the property requirement for white men, but set a prohibitive requirement of $250 (), about the price of a modest house, for black men.\\"African American Voting Rights\\" , New York State Archives, retrieved February 11, 2012 In the 1826 election, only 16 blacks voted in New York City. \\"As late as 1869, a majority of the state's voters cast ballots in favor of retaining property qualifications that kept New York's polls closed to many blacks. African-American men did not obtain equal voting rights in New York until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, in 1870.\\" Freedom's Journal The first issue of the Freedom's Journal, the first African-American newspaper, on March 16, 1827 Beginning March 16, 1827, John Brown Russwurm published Freedom's Journal, written by and directed to African Americans. Samuel Cornish and John Russwurm were editors of the journal; they used it to appeal to African Americans across the nation.Capie, Julia M. \\"Freedom of Unspoken Speech: Implied Defamation and Its Constitutional Limitations\\". Touro Law Review 31, no. 4 (October 2015): 675. The powerful words published spread rapid positive influence to African Americans who could help establish a new community. The emergence of an African-American journal was a very important movement in New York. It showed that blacks could gain education and be part of literate society. Gellman, David N. \\"Race, the Public Sphere, and Abolition in Late Eighteenth-Century New York,\\" Journal of the Early Republic 20, no. 4 (2000): 607‚Äì36. White newspapers published a \\"Bobalition\\" print series, which was fictional and corrupt. This was made in mockery of blacks, using the way an uneducated colored person would pronounce abolition.\\"In Pursuit of Freedom\\", Brooklyn Historical Society, retrieved April 24, 2016. African Burial Ground In 1991, a construction project required an archaeological and cultural study of 290 Broadway in Lower Manhattan to comply with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 before construction could begin. During the excavation and study, human remains were found in a former six-acre burial ground for African Americans that dated from the mid-1630s to 1795. It is believed that there are more than 15,000 skeletal remains of colonial New York's free and enslaved blacks. It is the country's largest and earliest burial ground for African-Americans. This discovery demonstrated the large- scale importance of slavery and African Americans to New York and national history and economy. The African Burial Ground has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and a National Monument for its significance. A memorial and interpretive center for the African Burial Ground have been created to honor those buried and to explore the many contributions of African Americans and their descendants to New York and the nation.\\"African Burial Ground National Monument\\", National Park Service; retrieved December 29, 2007 See also * African Americans in New York City * African Burial Ground National Monument * New York Conspiracy of 1741 * Human trafficking in New York * Sylvester Manor Notes References Further reading  External links * Slavery in New York, October 2005 ‚Äì September 2007, an exhibition by the New-York Historical Society * \\"Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City\\", PBS Newshour, January 25, 2007 * Slavery In Mamaroneck Township, Larchmont Website Category:African diaspora history Category:Pre-statehood history of New York (state) New York Category:African-American history in New York City Category:History of racism in New York (state) lap ","title":"History of slavery in New York (state)"},{"id":"13604919","text":"Carlton Williams Bongo Juma (15 November 1979 ‚Äì 29 November 2003), born in Nairobi and better known by his stage name K-Rupt, was a Kenyan rapper who had national success in the two years leading up to his murder in 2003.

Renamed Heliotrope, she commissioned at New York Navy Yard 24 April 1864.  Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Heliotrope was assigned initially to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and sailed soon after her commissioning to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she served as a tug and ordnance boat. She continued this duty with occasional patrols up the James River, until her transfer to the Potomac Flotilla 23 January 1865.  A destructive mission up the Rappahannock  Heliotrope reported for her new duties early in February, and participated 6‚Äì8 March in a joint expedition up the Rappahannock River to Fredericksburg, Virginia. In cooperation with Army units, Heliotrope and the other gunboats succeeded in destroying railroad facilities, a large quantity of track, and a depot of army supplies. Returning to routine patrolling in the Potomac River, she embarked with other gunboats on another expedition 16 March, sending her small boats with about 50 men up Mattox Creek. Three schooners and various types of supplies were captured or destroyed on this 2-day foray.  Decommissioning  The small gunboat continued her vital work of choking off Confederate supplies in the Potomac River area until mid-April, when she steamed for New York City, arriving 20 April.

It was probably covered in feathers of red, gold, white, and black. It was described from subfossil remains discovered at the Makauwahi Cave on the south coast of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands.  Extinction  The Kauai palila was one of many native Hawaiian birds that was affected by drastic changes in the environment due to farming. The dry forest was cut down, and irrigation from streams became widespread. The ecosystem became much wetter, and the remaining naio (Myoporum sandwicense) trees began to rot away. Soon Pila's palila was pushed to its limit, and became extinct, though it had lived for a long time, despite human competition and destruction of their habitat. Some speculate that the latest remaining specimen dates back to the 1800s. Today the Kauai palila is known from a few specimens, found on the island of Kauai. It is unknown if this bird ever had a name in the Hawaiian language, since it seems to have disappeared before Europeans arrived to apply a name.

It was constructed in 1620, and was the last of six Wignacourt towers to be built. The tower was demolished in the late 19th century by the British military. History Santa Maria delle Grazie Tower was built above the shore to the east of Grand Harbour, close to the present day town of Xgƒßajra, on or near the site of a medieval watch post. It was the last of the six Wignacourt towers to be built. The stone laying ceremony of the tower took place in April 1620, and it was built on land belonging to Giorgio Mamo, who later built the Mamo Tower. Santa Maria delle Grazie Tower only cost 4948 scudi to build, which was less than the cost of the other towers. This implies that it was smaller, however, it was the most heavily armed of the towers. Some weapons were therefore possibly deployed outside the tower (even though it had no external battery like some of the other towers). The exact shape of the tower is unknown, as no detailed plans, paintings or photographs of it are known. However, it is shown in a 1761 map as having four corner bastions and a flight of steps leading to the main entrance, so its overall design was possibly similar to the towers of St. Paul's Bay, St. Lucian and St. Mary, although on a smaller scale. Within it was a chapel dedicated to the Madonna delle Grazie.Malta illustrata ovvero Descrizione di Malta. p. 343. Forward ditch and glacis of Della Grazie Battery. The tower was located to the right of this photo. In 1799, during the French blockade, San Rocco Redoubt was built in the vicinity of the tower to provide cover in the case British troops had to retreat from Malta. The tower's condition in the nineteenth century is not known. The tower (or its ruins) was demolished by the British military in around 1888 to clear the line of fire of Della Grazie Battery, a new artillery battery which was named after the tower. Nineteenth- century maps show that the site of the tower became part of the battery's glacis. Today, no remains of the original tower survive. A street in Xgƒßajra is named after it - Triq it-Torri ta' Alof de Wignacourt (Alof de Wignacourt Tower Street). A heraldic representation of a Wignacourt tower is also featured on the flag and coat of arms of Xgƒßajra. Since Santa Maria delle Grazie Tower's design is not known, the representation seems to be based on the St. Paul's Bay Tower.

It was released on November 12, 1991 via Ruffhouse Records. Production was handled by several record producers, including Ced-Gee, TR Love and Moe Love from Ultramagnetic MC's, Bobby Crawford, Louis Flores, and Tim Dog himself. Fellow rapper Kool Keith made guest appearances on two tracks. The album spawned three singles, the infamous underground hit \\"Fuck Compton\\" (which disses the West Coast hip hop), \\"Step To Me\\" and \\"Bronx Nigga\\". The album peaked at number 155 on the US Billboard 200 chart, number 34 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, number 4 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. Background * The intro used the same beat as N.W.A's \\"efil4zaggin\\" album intro. Tim taunted \\"I stole your beat and made it better, to show the whole world that you ain't nothing but a bunch of pussies\\" before a number of disparaging answering machine messages supported Tim's position. Tim rapped: \\"Wearing all that black, driving them cars, but you still look wack!\\" * A skit called \\"DJ Quik Beat Down\\" was a forty-second audio snippet of Tim Dog physically assaulting DJ Quik. * The track \\"Step To Me\\" taunted Compton rappers and included the line \\"DJ Quik he can suck my dick\\". * \\"Michel'le Conversation\\" was a skit where a Michel'le soundalike called Tim Dog to complain about Tim's Compton diss, but then ended up admitting she was \\"tired of him (Dre) beating down on me\\" and for Tim to \\"Call me when you're in town\\". * The track \\"Goin Wild in the Penile\\" included an intro whereby Tim had recently been released from prison for shooting a \\"Compton kid\\". The lyrical insults were arguably the opening salvo in what would later become the East Coast versus West Coast hip hop conflict which would ultimately lead to the \\"beef\\" between Bad Boy Records and Death Row Records. Critical reception AllMusic's Ron Wynn gave Penicillin on Wax an \\"Album Pick\\" tag, saying \\"Bronx rapper Tim Dog informed the world what he thought of West Coast types with the single \\"F--- Compton.\\" It was the definitive composition on his debut album, setting the stage for a series of angry, often vicious and sneering taunts, challenges, boasts and putdowns.\\" Entertainment Weekly writer James Bernard commended Tim's \\"deep and ominous\\" vocals for delivering \\"attention-grabbing moments\\" at times but felt the album gets weighted down with Tim's lyrical tirades against N.W.A over unspectacular beats, concluding that \\"Yes, \\"dissing\\" is a proud rap tradition, but such one-note obsession gets pretty boring. Move on, Tim Dog, move on.\\" Robert Christgau cited \\"Fuck Compton\\" as a \\"choice cut\\", indicating a good song on \\"an album that isn't worth your time or money.\\" In a retrospective review, DJ Fatboy of RapReviews praised the overall production throughout the album, Tim's \\"forceful\\" delivery of his absurd lyricism despite wishing he craft better lyrics and Kool Keith's guest contributions on \\"I Ain't Havin' It\\" and \\"Secret Fantasies\\", concluding that, \\"Great production values, utter craziness.

It contains smooth domes that are lined with transverse ridges like a corrugated roof. They can vary in size from 10 to 150 km in length, 5 to 15 km in width, and 500 to 1500 m in height. History, distribution and exploration The first oceanic core complexes described were identified in the Atlantic Ocean.; Since then numerous such structures have been identified primarily in oceanic lithosphere formed at intermediate, slow- and ultra-slow spreading mid-ocean ridges, as well as back-arc basins.; Examples include 10-1000 square km expanses of ocean floor and therefore of the oceanic lithosphere, particularly along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Southwest Indian Ridge. Some of these structures have been drilled and sampled, showing that the footwall can be composed of both mafic plutonic and ultramafic rocks (gabbro and peridotite primarily, in addition to diabase), and a thin shear zone that includes hydrous phyllosilicates. Oceanic core complexes are often associated with active hydrothermal fields. Formation Oceanic core complex structures form at slow spreading oceanic plate boundaries which have a limited supply of upwelling magma. These zones have low upper mantle temperatures and long transform faults develop. Rift valleys do not develop along the expansion axes of slow spreading boundaries. Expansion takes place along low-angle detachment faults. The core complex builds on the uplifted side of the fault where most of the gabbroic (or crustal) material is stripped away to expose mantle peridotite. They comprise peridotites ultramafic rocks of mantle and to a lesser extent gabbroic rocks from the Earth's crust. Each detachment fault has three notable features: a breakaway zone where the fault began, an exposed fault surface that rides over the dome and a termination, which is usually marked by a valley and adjacent ridge. However, the formation process through detachment faults has its limitations, such as the scarce seismic evidence that low-angle normal faulting do exist, where the presumably significant offset along such faults, which transect the lithosphere at low angle should be involved with some friction. The rarity of eclogite in oceanic core complexes also casts doubt on the deep source in such domains. The abundance of peridotites in oceanic core complexes could be accounted for by a unique variation of ocean-ocean subduction at the junction of slow-spreading oceanic ridges and fracture zones. Analog models of subduction show that density contrast of more than 200 kg/m^3 between two juxtaposed lithospheric slabs would lead the underthrusting of the denser one to depth of circa 50 km, where remineralization of pyroxenes into garnets would increase the slab's density and drive it into the mantle, provided that the friction between the slabs would be low. There is ground to presume that at slow ridge and fracture zone intersections, the density contrast of the juxtaposed slabs would exceed 200 kg/m^3, the friction between the slabs would be low, the thermal gradient would be ca. 100 deg. C/km, and with ca. 5% water contents, the drop of the solidus of basalt at relatively low pressure would enable the co-occurrence of serpentinites and peridotites, the abundant rock-types in oceanic core complexes. Examples Saint Peter Saint Paul Megamullion, Equatorial Atlantic Ocean Some 50 oceanic core complexes have been identified, including: * Godzilla Mullion, part of the Parece Vela Rift in the Western Pacific Ocean between Japan and the Philippines was discovered in 2001. It is about 155 km long by 55 km across, and is the largest known ocean core complex in the world. *The Saint Peter Saint Paul complex lies in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. It is 90 km long and 4000 m high. The apex forms the Saint Peter and Paul Rocks. This is one of the few known examples where sea floor mantle rocks are exposed above sea level. Research Scientific interest in core complexes has dramatically increased following an expedition in 1996 which mapped the Atlantis Massif. This expedition was the first to associate the complex structures with detachment faults. Research includes: *To investigate the structure of the mantle: :The complexes provide cross sections of mantle material which could only otherwise be found by drilling deep into the mantle. The deep drilling that is required to penetrate 6-7 km through the crust is beyond current technical and financial constraints. Selective sample drilling into the complex structures are already underway. *To investigate the formation of detachment faults *To investigate the development of oceanic core complexes: :In 2005 scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute discovered a series of complexes in the North Atlantic, from Bermuda. These structures are at various stages in their evolution‚Äîfrom bumps that indicated the emergence of a core complex to the faded grooves of long-exhumed core complexes that had been eroded away over millions of years. Such features will enable scientists to see active detachment faults in operation and understand their development. *To study mineralisation and the release of minerals from the mantle: :A steeply sloping detachment fault which penetrates deeply can be a conduit for hot mineral-rich hydrothermal fluids to circulate towards the surface and build mineral deposits. These deposits can grow massive because detachment faults persist for hundreds of thousands of years. The Woods Hole Institution is studying one such site, called the TAG hydrothermal field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. *To investigate marine magnetic anomalies: :The conventional view that marine magnetic anomalies arose in the upper, extrusive layer of the oceanic crust requires a rethink because perfectly normal magnetic anomalies arise at core complexes, where the crust has been stripped away. This suggests that the lower part of the ocean crust contains a substantial magnetic signature.

With 30 episodes, it had the greatest number of episodes of any single Judge Dredd story until \\"The Doomsday Scenario\\" in 1999 (although \\"Oz\\" had a higher page count, at 199 pages). It introduced the supporting characters of Galen DeMarco, Judge Guthrie and Judge Buell. It tells of Judge Dredd's temporary assignment as the sector chief of Sector 301. Plot By the year 2117 Mega-City One's Sector 301, disparagingly nicknamed \\"The Pit,\\" is the most crime-ridden and corrupt sector in the future city. Each city sector has its own sector house of street judges, and the judges in Sector 301 are the worst, as the sector has been used as a dumping ground for every inadequate judge who, but for manpower shortages, would normally have been dismissed from the force. Corruption and incompetence at 301 are rife, and when judges are suspected of complicity in the murder of Sector Chief Rohan, Judge Dredd is appointed sector chief in her place, with instructions to investigate the murder and also to whip the Pit's judges into shape. Essentially a desk assignment, sector chief is not Dredd's chosen role, and he resents the paperwork and isolation from daily law enforcement. (It is for this reason that Dredd, in an earlier story, turned down the opportunity to become chief judge of the whole city.) However Dredd diligently sets about his task, and sets up a task force of judges outside the SJS (the Special Judicial Squad, who normally deal with internal affairs), since even the local SJS judges are not above suspicion. Dredd supplements the task force with judges from outside The Pit, established characters Judge Giant and Judge Castillo, but their role in the story is less than that of the new characters. Dredd initially appoints Judge DeMarco to lead the task force, as she is the most capable judge in the sector. However he later has to suspend her when Castillo discovers that DeMarco is having an illicit affair with another judge, Judge Warren, in contravention of regulations. DeMarco redeems herself when she saves Castillo from a gang of thugs (even though this allowed Castillo to discover her affair with Warren), but Warren is suspended, having failed to intervene because it would have exposed them. He loses his temper and assaults Dredd, who immediately places him under arrest. Dredd appoints Judge Buell to take over command of the task force. From the beginning of the corruption investigation, Dredd is greatly assisted by information provided by a renegade undercover judge, Judge Guthrie, who has apparently gone rogue after killing three judges and becoming a fugitive. Guthrie's evidence leads to the discovery that many of Sector 301's judges are indeed corrupt, and some are even in the pay of the \\"Frendz Mob,\\" a mafia-style organised crime syndicate. Dredd and his task force eventually arrest twenty-four judges for various crimes, and two more are killed by Dredd and Guthrie while resisting arrest. A third judge is killed in action before his crimes are discovered. A further two judges - the local head and deputy head of the sector's SJS - are also killed by or on the orders of the Frendz Mob, to conceal the Mob's infiltration of the sector house. In spite of that setback, however, Dredd's mission is otherwise a success, as the sector house has been purged of corruption. Judge Guthrie is reinstated and reassigned to uniform duties, after satisfying Dredd that he is innocent (the judges he killed having been trying to murder him at the behest of the Frendz). DeMarco is also reinstated. Buell and his partner Judge Garcia are promoted to become, respectively, the new head and deputy head of SJS at 301, after Castillo declines the promotion. Undeterred by the lack of evidence against the Frendz Mob, Dredd initiates a massive campaign of harassment against them, raiding all of their known buildings and vigorously punishing every crime detected, however minor. Eventually this goads the local Frendz boss into a reprisal action, and he instigates a sector-wide riot, which escalates into a full-scale gang war against the judges. Reinforced by new graduates from the Academy of Law, the beleaguered judges fight back, with Dredd himself in the heart of the conflict. During the chaos, Warren escapes from custody and abducts DeMarco, who is forced to kill him in self-defence. Eventually the judges prevail and regain control of the streets. The local Frendz boss still can not be tied to the recent violence, but when over three hundred unpaid parking tickets come to light he is sentenced to thirty days per ticket: a total sentence of over twenty-five years (in much the same way that Al Capone was brought to justice for tax evasion in 1931). Keen to return to his regular duties, Dredd resigns his commission and hands over the sector house to his successor, Judge Uris.

Investors bet on the future of oil prices through a financial instrument, oil futures in which they agree on a contract basis, to buy or sell oil at a set date in the future. Crude oil is stored in salt mines, tanks and oil tankers. Investors can choose to take profits or losses prior to when the oil delivery date arrives or they can leave the contract in place and physical oil is delivered on the set date to an officially designated delivery point. In the United States, that is usually to Cushing, Oklahoma. When delivery dates approach, they close out existing contracts and sell new ones for future delivery of the same oil. The oil never moves out of storage. If the forward market is in \\"contango\\"‚Äîthe forward price is higher than the current spot price‚Äîthe strategy is very successful. While new tanks have been added in Cushing for a storage capacity of 6.6 million barrels, by March 2015 all the tanks were fully leased through 2015. In 2015, global capacity for oil storage was out-paced by global oil production and an oil glut occurred. Crude oil storage space became a tradable commodity with CME Group‚Äî which owns NYMEX‚Äî offering oil-storage futures contracts in March 2015. Traders and producers can buy and sell the right to store certain types of oil. Chronology The concept started to be used by oil traders in the market in early 1990. But it was in 2007 through 2009 that the oil storage trade expanded. Many participants‚Äîincluding Wall Street giants, such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Citicorp‚Äîturned sizeable profits simply by sitting on tanks of oil. By May 2007 Cushing's inventory fell by nearly 35% as the oil-storage trade heated up. Knock Nevis (1979-2010), a ULCC supertanker and the longest ship ever built. By the end of October 2009 one in twelve of the largest oil tankers were being used more for temporary storage of oil than for transportation. From June 2014 to January 2015, as the price of oil dropped 60 percent and the supply of oil remained high, the world's largest traders in crude oil purchased at least 25 million barrels to store in supertankers to try and make a profit in the future should prices rise. Trafigura, Vitol, Gunvor, Koch, Shell and other major energy companies began to book oil storage supertankers for up to 12 months. By 13 January 2015 at least 11 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) and Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC) were reported as booked with storage options, rising from around five vessels the prior week. Each VLCC can hold 2 million barrels. By 5 March 2015, as oil production outpaced oil demand by 1.5 million barrels a day, storage capacity globally dwindled. Crude oil is stored in old salt mines, in tanks and on tankers. In the United States alone, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, U.S. crude-oil supplies were at almost 70% of the U.S. storage capacity, the highest supply to capacity ratio since 1935. According to Bloomberg Business, the efficiency of newer shale oil wells that use hydraulic fracturing in the United States, combined with the $12 million upfront well drilling and construction costs, provide incentives to oil producers to continue to flood the already glutted market with under-priced oil in spite of crude oil storage limitations. Many less efficient and less productive older wells were shut down but these shale oil wells continue to increase production while making a profit in a market where crude oil is priced as low as $50 a barrel. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) The United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil‚Äî727 million barrels‚Äî stored in huge underground salt caverns along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. An emergency oil stockpile was recommended by several Presidents throughout the twentieth century, in 1944, in 1952, 1956 and in 1970. The SPR is a \\"deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool of foreign policy\\" but it has rarely been used. On October 20, 2014, a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended reducing the size of the Reserve. According to the report, the amount of oil held in reserve exceeds the amount required to be kept on hand since the need for foreign imports of crude oil have decreased in recent years. The report said the U.S. Department of Energy agreed with the GAO‚Äôs recommendation.

Androdioecy is rare in comparison to the other major reproductive systems: dioecy, gynodioecy and hermaphroditism. In animals, androdioecy has been considered an important stepping stone in the transition from dioecy to hermaphroditism, and vice versa. Evolution of androdioecy The fitness requirements for androdioecy to arise and sustain itself are theoretically so improbable that it was long considered that such systems do not exist.Darwin C. 1877. The different forms of flowers and plants of the same species. New York: Appleton. Particularly, males and hermaphrodites have to have the same fitness, in other words the same number of offspring, in order to be maintained. However, males only have offspring by fertilizing eggs or ovules of hermaphrodites, while hermaphrodites have offspring both through fertilizing eggs or ovules of other hermaphrodites and their own ovules. This means that all else being equal, males have to fertilize twice as many eggs or ovules as hermaphrodites to make up for the lack of female reproduction. Androdioecy can evolve either from dioecious ancestors through the invasion of hermaphrodites or from hermaphroditic ancestors through the invasion of males. The ancestral state is important because conditions under which androdioecy can evolve differ significantly. =Androdioecy with dioecious ancestry= In roundworms, clam shrimp, tadpole shrimp and cancrid shrimps, androdioecy has evolved from dioecy. In these systems, hermaphrodites can only fertilize their own eggs (self-fertilize) and do not mate with other hermaphrodites. Males are the only means of outcrossing. Hermaphrodites may be beneficial in colonizing new habitats, because a single hermaphrodite can generate many other individuals. In the well-studied roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, males are very rare and only occur in populations that are in bad condition or stressed. =Androdioecy with hermaphroditic ancestry= In animals, corals (phyla Cnidaria) and barnacles (Subphyla Crustacea), androdioecy has evolved from hermaphroditism. Many plants self-fertilize, and males may be sustained in a population when inbreeding depression is severe because males guarantee outcrossing. Androdioecious species Despite their unlikely evolution, 115 androdioecious animal and about 50 androdioecious plant species are known.

Garcia's campaign raised over $1.8 million but incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Mario D√≠az-Balart defeated Garcia 53%-47%. This 6% lost is easily the closest that a Democrat has come to defeating one of the D√≠az-Balart brothers in a Congressional election. 2010 In April 2010, Garcia announced his candidacy for the 25th district again, after U.S. Congressman Mario D√≠az-Balart announced he would run for reelection in the 21st District being vacated by his brother, Lincoln D√≠az-Balart. In his campaign announcement, Garcia stated he would focus on job creation, funding education and health care as his top priorities.

The district had been pushed well to the east and south, losing its share of Collier County and picking up all of Monroe County, including the Keys. The race was widely expected to be much closer than in previous cycles. Not only was it more evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans than its predecessor, but Rivera's campaign was hobbled by numerous scandals. In addition to several state probes, Rivera was the target of a federal investigation into allegations he tried to sabotage the Democratic primary in the 26th by secretly funding an unknown candidate, Justin Lamar Sternad, in hopes of avoiding a rematch against Garc√≠a. Several vendors whom Sternad employed in his campaign told the Miami Herald that Rivera had funded Sternad's campaign. Sternad himself subsequently told the FBI that Rivera had funded his campaign. Sternad's campaign manager, Ana Alliegro, was a close friend of Rivera. According to Sternad she served as the go-between. Garcia won the rematch, defeating Rivera 54%‚Äì43%. He was the first Cuban-American Democrat to represent Florida in Congress.

The gang was formed after Evans broke with the John Kinney Gang. After breaking away, he brought along with him Billy Morton, Frank Baker, Tom Hill, Dolly Graham, George Davis, Jim McDaniels, Buffalo Bill Spawn, Bob Martin, Manuel \\"Indian\\" Segovia and Nicholas Provencio. History =Early history= The gang initiated numerous acts of robbery and cattle rustling from 1876 through 1880, most committed in New Mexico. Sometime in the spring of 1876 Evans and other gang members killed Pancho Cruz, Roman Mes and Tomas Cuerele at Shedd's ranch at San Augustin, Dona Ana County. They then shifted their domain to Lincoln County, New Mexico. They raided John Chisum's ranch, whom Evans had once worked for, and the Mescalero Apache reservation. Sometime around the 1877 mark it is believed that Billy the Kid rode with them. =Lincoln County War= The gang was hired in late 1877 by the \\"Murphy-Dolan Faction\\", to harass the latter's opposition in Lincoln County, New Mexico. They began by rustling the cattle and horses of the Tunstall-McSween Faction. In February 1878, a posse was dispatched by Sheriff Brady to arrest rancher John Tunstall. That posse included Jesse Evans, William Morton, Frank Baker, Tom Hill and Dolly Graham, all members of Evans' gang. They ambushed and murdered Tunstall on February 18, 1878, which ignited the Lincoln County War. Several days later, on March 9, 1878, the Lincoln County Regulators, a vigilante posse formed by Tunstall and McSween supporters and at the time led by Dick Brewer caught Morton and Baker, and executed both men. On that same day Jesse Evans was injured and Tom Hill was killed while attempting to raid a ranch near Tularosa. Evans was arrested but managed to break out of jail. Evans returned and was present at the five-day siege at McSween's house, known as the Battle of Lincoln. =After the Lincoln County War= After the war he and Billy Mathews are said to have attempted to make peace with Billy The Kid, but the two killed lawyer Huston Chapman, putting them on the run from law enforcement. The gang fled down to Texas, but Texas Rangers began pursuing them relentlessly, and killed several gang members including Dolly Graham. The Rangers caught up with the gang, including Evans, in Presidio del Norte, Mexico, on July 3, 1880. The gunfight that followed would mark the end of the Jesse Evans Gang. The Rangers engaged them in a shootout, during which Evans shot and killed Ranger George Bingham, and Ranger D.T. Carson was wounded by other gang members. In turn, Ranger Carson and Ranger Ed Sieker shot and killed gang member George Davis, and shot and wounded gang member John Gross. The remaining members were captured. Gross was sentenced to a long prison term, but spent less than four years. Evans was sentenced to ten years. But in 1882 the outlaw walked out of prison a free man, and decided jail was not for him. His debt paid to society he was never heard from again. In 1948, however, almost seventy years after he disappeared, Jesse's brother died and his estate needed to be settled. It was then that Jesse Evans re-appeared and revealed that he had been living in Florida under the alias Joe Hines. Joe Hines was able to prove to the satisfaction of a court of law that he was the one and only Jesse Evans of legend.Billy the Kid: An Autobiography Known members This is a list of all the known members of the Jesse Evans gang: *Jesse Evans, disappeared after being released from prison.

Recreational Sea Anglers point out that most of their activity is confined to fishing from the shore, and shore based installations, and from small boats confined to close inshore areas, and yet the social and economic benefits from the Recreational Sea Angling sector rival the benefits from the commercial fishing sector who operate over a much wider area and derive the greater part of their economic benefit from fisheries far offshore.

He was the 1st Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin and a Union Army officer in the American Civil War. Early life Born in Glastonbury, Connecticut, Holmes moved with his parents to New York when he was four; and both parents died when he was eight. He then lived with his grandfather until he was twelve. He moved to Hamilton, in Madison County, and studied while working to support himself, and was able to teach in a common school. He attended an academy and prepared himself and was ordained a Universalist minister in 1833. He preached for a short time in Michigan and Ohio. He soon began to study law in Illinois and was admitted to the bar in Illinois. He joined the Democratic Party and moved to the Wisconsin Territory, settling in what is now Jefferson, Wisconsin, to practice law. Career Holmes served on the Council of the Wisconsin Territory--the upper house of the territorial legislature--representing Jefferson and Dodge Counties through the final years before statehood. When Wisconsin became a State, in 1848, Mr. Holmes was chosen as the first lieutenant governor of the state, and served in that capacity for 1848 and 1849 under governor Nelson Dewey. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1849. But in 1852 he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 1853 session, surviving an election challenge from Benjamin F. Adams. Civil War After the outbreak of the Civil War, Holmes volunteered for service with the Union Army and, in August 1862, he became a Quartermaster for the 22nd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He remained with the regiment until March 25, 1863, when he was taken prisoner along with many of his regiment at the Battle of Brentwood. He was sent to Libby Prison where he became seriously ill. He was returned to the Union in a prisoner exchange on May 5, 1863. Death Two days after his release, Holmes was sent to Annapolis, Maryland, where he died the next day on May 8, 1863. His remains were brought to Jefferson, and were interred with Masonic rites at Greenwood Cemetery Jefferson, Jefferson County, Wisconsin.'Proceedings of the State Bar Association of Wisconsin,' State Bar of Association of Wisconsin: 1905, pg. 204-207 Family life Son of Solomon and Ann (McKee) Holmes, Holmes married Miss Ruth A.

It was built by the British between 1888 and 1893. The battery stands above the shore to the east of Grand Harbour, between Fort Saint Rocco and Fort Saint Leonardo. It is currently in a dilapidated state, and part of the battery is used as the town hall for Xgƒßajra. History Construction of the battery started in October 1888 and was completed in March 1893, at a cost of ¬£16,344. It was constructed to take advantage of the improved breech loading guns then coming into service. It was equipped with two 6 inch and two 10 inch breech loading guns in disappearing mounts. The installation takes the form of a polygonal fort, irregular hexagonal in plan, with two caponiers defending the forward ditches. Access to the fort is via a gatehouse and causeway across the rear ditch. The battery takes its name from the much earlier Wignacourt tower, the Santa Maria delle Grazie Tower that stood close to the present battery. The tower was demolished to clear the field of fire of the present battery. The battery was abandoned in 1910 and its guns were removed. However, in World War II the battery was used as a coastal defence search light battery. At this time some structures were added to accommodate the searchlights. Present day The battery is now under the care of the Xgƒßajra Local Council. Part of the battery serves as the town hall for the locality, while the rest of the battery was partially restored in collaboration with Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna. It was planned that the battery will be opened to the public and form the focal point for a public space, Battery Park. The battery is currently in a dilapidated state, with most of its outer revetment walls having collapsed into the ditch. In 2015, the battery was shortlisted as a possible site for the campus of the proposed American University of Malta. It was not chosen, and the campus is to be split up between Dock No. 1 in Cospicua and ≈ªonqor Point in Marsaskala.

Bourne was born in Newcastle, the son of Thomas Bourne, a tailor, in about 1694: he was baptised on 16 December 1694. His father originally had him apprenticed as a glazier; but he showed such promise that he was sent to the Royal Free Grammar School in Newcastle, where he flourished, eventually winning a scholarship to Cambridge under the tutelage of The Reverend Mr. Thomas Atherton, a fellow Novocastrian.Myers Literary Guide 2004 He was appointed curate at All Hallows Church in Newcastle in 1724 and held the position until his death in 1733. In 1725 Bourne published his most acclaimed work, Antiquitates Vulgares, or, Antiquities of the Common People. This provided a record of various folk customs and ceremonies in England, although its more pragmatic aim was to identify those customs that might be encouraged, and those that should be abolished or regulated. His huge and very complete history of Newcastle was not quite finished upon his death in Newcastle on 16 February 1733.

It was endemic to the Hawaiian islands of Kauai and Oahu. It is only known from fossil remains and likely became extinct before the first Europeans visited Hawaii in 1778.  Description  The Kauai finch was about 5¬Ω inch in length and had a very blunt bill that possibly could crack nuts and flowers (e.g., ‚Äò≈çhi‚Äòa lehua blossoms) to digest the cellulose easily. It has also been speculated that insects perhaps formed part of its diet. The Kauai finch was believed to have once survived in highland forest, but its fossils have been found frequently at the lower elevations of the island. Extinction Due to its early extinction, very little is known about this species. It is only known from a few bones found in caves. It appears that this species began to go extinct when the first Polynesians settlers came to the islands. They cleared some of the land for farming and introduced species for which the native birds had no defence. Five hundred years before Europeans made landfall to Hawaii, the bird was probably extinct. According to fossil records, their numbers declined rapidly in the early 16th century. It has been speculated that this species' visits to lower elevations was its undoing due to contact with avian diseases and pests. Finches were once known on all of the other larger Hawaiian islands, but the highland finch seems to have outlived the Oaho finch. Today, only about sixty percent of Hawaii have not been drastically altered. Many avian diseases and parasites also pose a major threat to Hawai\`i's native forest birds.

The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History This historic rowhouse was built in the wake of the Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913 which ravaged Midtown and North Omaha. The building was designed by Clarence W. Wigington, a well-known African American architect raised in Omaha. The influence of Wigington's mentor, Thomas R. Kimball, is evident throughout the design of the structure. Wigington originally designed the building in 1909 for a contest organized by Good Housekeeping magazine. He won first prize for the best two-family dwelling. In a recent biography of the architect, the Minnesota Historical Society described the building: :At first glance, simple rectangles in a craftsman vein, they pierce the skyline with a succession of minutely scaled triangles and rectangles ‚Äì a sort of Gothicism shorn of religious aspirations... four pilasters rise from a broad pedestal... One can always sense him looking for that one element of the building to put on center stage and wrap with scenic effects, whatever the dictates of the stylistic propriety.Taylor, D.V. (2002) Cap Wigington, An Architectural Legacy in Ice and Stone, Minnesota Historical Society Press. p 28. The rowhouse's original owner was Jack Broomfield, a key African-American political leader during the reign of Tom Dennison, informal political boss in the city. According to the Omaha preservation organization Landmarks, Inc., the Broomfield Rowhouse was selected for the Register under the following criteria: :Property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of a construction or represents the role of a master, or possesses a high artistic value, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components lack individual distinction.

It has been long one of the leading Warwickshire clubs in hurling, competing in the county Senior Championship, and in camogie, competing at Junior level. There is an associated Gaelic football club. The club is named after John Mitchel, the 19th-century Irish revolutionary.  History  John Mitchel's Hurling Club was formed in 1933, around the same time as the Warwickshire County Board. In fact, the club supplied pitches and playing kit to the county, which is how the Warwickshire hurlers came to have a white strip. In the early years the club had such great Gaels as Paddy Ryan from Pallasgreen, County Limerick and Mick Ryan from County Laois at the helm. In the 1940s, the club was dominant in all competitions. Then in the 1960s, John Mitchel's built what was arguably their best-ever team - they reached their peak in 1971 winning the Warwickshire championship and getting through to the Championship of Britain final. Here they faced the mighty Brian Boru's in New Eltham. This Brians team featured no fewer than ten London senior players who had played in the Munster championship, including Johnny Barrett, Timmy Sheehan, Roger Cashin, Paddy McGrath, Patsy O'Neill, Pat McDermott, Martin Connolly and Tom Connolly. The Mitchels had many stars of their own with many fine hurlers such as Billy Collins, Jimmy Moynihan, Paddy Grimes, Liam Dalton and Ritchie Walsh. They beat the Brians in a highly competitive match. = Reformed club - 1990 = Some years later, the John Mitchel's hurling club folded due to lack of players. But in 1990, the club was reformed by Tom O'Brien, Tom Healy, Jimmy Moynihan and Billy Collins, amongst others, and by 1991 they had regained the Warwickshire Senior Hurling crown. Soon afterwards Frank, Larry and Anne Healy along with Martin Gannon started an underage set-up in the club. This was a huge undertaking comprising a lot of hard work, but was rewarded in Ruislip in 2004 when the club beat London GAA champions Brothers Pearse to win the club championship of Britain. More than 30 years after that famous victory in New Eltham, the club had again claimed a British championship and this time went on to the All Ireland club quarter final losing out by a point. A great hurler with the team in their glory days was Billy Collins from Limerick, who remained heavily involved in the club and Warwickshire hurling until his death in 2008. Billy served as chairman of the County Board for over 25 years. He also helped develop and maintain P√°irc na h√âireann, in Solihull, the county's ground, to ensure it was able to host top fixtures. Bill's son, Michael, has also been involved with the club and county and was involved in the management of the county team in the Nicky Rackard Cup and Leinster league. Michael has also followed in his fathers footsteps by holding the office of Chairman of the Warwickshire county board. John Mitchel's regained the club championship of Britain in 2007, once again against Brothers Pearse in Ruislip, after an exciting drawn game in P√°irc na h√âireann. They retained the crown in P√°irc na h√âireann in November 2008 to become - most appropriately - the first holders of the Billy Collins Cup, which was donated by the Provincial Council of Britain.

Biography Souter was born in Perth, and studied at the University of Aberdeen and the University of Cambridge. He subsequently became a Latin assistant at Aberdeen. While at Cambridge he studied under J. E. B. Mayor, whom Souter would credit with influence on his later scholarship. In 1903 he was appointed professor of New Testament Greek and Exegesis at Mansfield College, Oxford. In 1911 he moved back to the University of Aberdeen, succeeding William Ramsay as Regius Professor of Humanity, in which position he remained until his retirement in 1937. Upon his retirement, Souter moved back to Oxford, where he became editor-in-chief of the proposed Oxford Latin Dictionary. The outbreak of World War II prevented its completion within his lifetime, but Souter did publish a smaller work borne of this endeavor, Glossary of Later Latin, A.D. 150‚Äì600. Souter married Elizabeth Barr Anderson, daughter of Aberdeen Photographer William Blair Anderson. They had three daughters, Isabella Elise Souter (who married Alfred Dixon) born in 1901, Elizabeth Barr Anderson Souter born in 1903 and Alexandra Margaret Souter (known as Peggy, who married Peter Jackson) born in 1908. His brother-in-law was William Blair Anderson, who was Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge University and a leading Latin scholar of his day. Scholarship Souter's two main interests were in the text of the New Testament and in early Latin commentaries on the Pauline epistles. He published an edition of the New Testament in 1910 (revised edition 1947) giving the Greek text on which the English Revised Version of 1881 was based, along with commentary on variants. His work on the Pauline epistles included proposed revisions to many accepted attributions, notably of Ambrosiaster, as well as numerous commentaries on and editions of other works.

Later in life, Waugh spurned Carew, but in spite of this Carew continued to be Waugh's loyal supporter, including denying the allegations of youthful homosexuality that had been made against him.Cocktails With Elvira: Anthea Rosemary Carew Retrieved 26 July 2015 In 1928 he married Anthea Gamble. The marriage was not a success, and they divorced just five years later. He was a special correspondent of The Times in the 1920s and 1930s, and reported on cricket matches for the paper. From 1945 until his retirement in 1963 he was the paper's film critic, and also wrote book reviews and amusing fourth leaders.The Cricketer, June 1981, p. 35. Almost all his articles for The Times were written anonymously, as was the paper's policy until William Rees-Mogg became its editor in 1967. John Arlott wrote of him: > It was, perhaps, unfortunate for Dudley Carew that his entry into cricket > writing should have coincided with the rise of Neville Cardus. If there had > never been a Cardus, how highly should we have ranked one who wrote: \\"At the > other end Gunn batted much as a man potters about a garden, digging his fork > into a bed with an abstracted and absent-minded air...\\" Arlott also rated highly Carew's cricket novel, Son of Grief, saying: \\"It has its darknesses, but it is convincing, and its characters are rounded and credible.\\" The title, as with another of Carew's cricket books, was taken from the poetry of A. E. Housman. Housman's A Shropshire Lad contains the lines: Now in Maytime to the wicket Out I march with bat and pad: See the son of grief at cricket Trying to be glad.

Between 1832 and 1856, Beall loaned the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians' delegations to Washington, D.C. some $3,000 for their expenses while they pursued claims against the federal government. He was promised one third of whatever they recovered, but when they won their case, he claimed and recovered only his actual expenditures.Viola, Herman J. Diplomats in Buckskins: A History of Indian Delegations in Washington City Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1995; p. 57 Beall served as a delegate to both the first and second Wisconsin Constitutional Conventions from Marquette County, one of only six men to do so (most members of the first convention declined to serve in the second).Smith, William R. The History of Wisconsin. In Three Parts, Historical, Documentary and Descriptive. Madison: Beriah Brown, Printer, 1854. Part II. - Documentary. Vol. III; p. 302. Beall was a Democrat, and served as lieutenant governor for Nelson Dewey's second term as governor, from 1850 until 1852. During the American Civil War, he was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of the 18th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry under Colonel James S. Alban. The 18th Wisconsin was organized in February 1862, proceeded to Tennessee in March, and was thrown into battle at Shiloh a day after their arrival. Beall was wounded in the battle and his leg was amputated below the knee. Colonel Alban was killed, along with the Regiment's third-in-command, Major Josiah W. Crane. After recovering, Beall served as second-in-command of a prisoner of war camp in Elmira, New York, where the prisoners nicknamed him \\"old peg-leg\\" and accused him of a pattern of repeated cruelty and abuse.Gray, Michael P. The Business of Captivity: Elmira and Its Civil War Prison Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 2001; pp. 125-126 Death After briefly returning to Wisconsin after the war, Beall moved to Helena, Montana, where, on September 26, 1868, he was shot following an argument with a newspaper editor. Beall, Samuel Wooton[? 1807 - 1868]. Wisconsin Historical Society. He was re-interred in 1907 at Forestvale Cemetery in Helena. Family life Son of Lewis and Eliza Beall, in 1829, he married Elizabeth Fenimore Cooper, a niece of James Fenimore Cooper, and they had seven children.

Wegelius studied in Leipzig, Vienna and Munich. He had intended to pursue a career as a composer, and wrote handful of orchestral works and a significant number of chamber and vocal works. He was a particular admirer of Wagner but wrote predominantly in the Romantic style. After founding the Institute he had little time for composing, and appears to have concentrated exclusively on teaching. The most famous graduate of Wegelius' Institute was Jean Sibelius. He is often compared with his contemporary and rival Robert Kajanus, founder of the Helsinki Symphony Orchestra, the first professional symphony orchestra in the Nordic countries. He is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.

A shell is a differential element of the flow. By looking at the momentum and forces on one small portion, it is possible to integrate over the flow to see the larger picture of the flow as a whole. The balance is determining what goes into and out of the shell. Momentum is created within the shell through fluid entering and leaving the shell and by shear stress. In addition, there are pressure and gravitational forces on the shell. The goal of a shell balance is to determine the velocity profile of the flow. The velocity profile is an equation to calculate the velocity based on a specific location in the flow. From this, it is possible to find a velocity for any point across the flow.  Applications  Shell Balances can be used in many situations. For example, flow in a pipe, the flow of multiple fluids around each other, or flow due to pressure difference. Although terms in the shell balance and boundary conditions will change, the basic set up and process is the same.  Requirements for Shell Balance Calculations The fluid must exhibit: *Laminar flow *No bends or curves *Steady State *Two boundary conditions Boundary Conditions are used to find constants of integration. *Fluid - Solid Boundary: No-slip condition, the velocity of a liquid at a solid is equal to the velocity of the solid. *Liquid - Gas Boundary: Shear Stress = 0. *Liquid - Liquid Boundary: Equal velocity and shear stress on both liquids.  Performing shell balances  A fluid is flowing between and in contact with two horizontal surfaces of contact area A. A differential shell of height Œîy is utilized (see diagram below). Diagram of the shell balance process in fluid mechanics The top surface is moving at velocity U and the bottom surface is stationary. *Density of fluid = œÅ *Viscosity of fluid = Œº *Velocity in x direction = V_x, shown by the diagonal line above. This is what a shell balance is solving for. Conservation of Momentum is the Key of a Shell Balance *(Rate of momentum in) - (rate of momentum out) + (sum of all forces) = 0 To perform a shell balance, follow the following basic steps: #Find momentum from shear stress.(Momentum from Shear Stress Into System) - (Momentum from Shear Stress Out of System). Momentum from Shear Stress goes into the shell at y and leaves the system at y + Œîy. Shear stress = œÑyx, area = A, momentum = œÑyxA. #Find momentum from the flow. Momentum flows into the system at x = 0 and out at x = L. The flow is steady state. Therefore, the momentum flow at x = 0 is equal to the moment of flow at x = L. Therefore, these cancel out. #Find gravity force on the shell. #Find pressure forces. #Plug into conservation of momentum and solve for œÑyx. #Apply Newton's law of viscosity for a Newtonian fluidœÑyx = -Œº(dVx/dy). #Integrate to find the equation for velocity and use Boundary Conditions to find constants of integration.

The result of this report provided an understanding of drastic differences in the economic development for both the North and South hemispheres of the world. Thesis The Brandt Report suggests primarily that a great chasm in standard of living exists along the North-South divide and there should therefore be a large transfer of resources from developed to developing countries. The countries North of the divide are extremely wealthy due to their successful trade in manufactured goods, whereas the countries South of the divide suffer poverty due to their trade in intermediate goods, where the export incomes are low. The Brandt Commission envisaged a new kind of global security. It built its arguments on a pluralist perspective that combines several social, economic and political perils together with classical military perils. The Brandt Line The Brandt line, division of world on rich north and poor south. The Brandt Line is a visual depiction of the North-South divide between their economies, based on GDP per capita, proposed by Willy Brandt in the 1980s.

The manga was published by the distributor Tokyopop, and was released on December 26, 2007 along with Dark River, the second book in Warriors: Power of Three. It follows Graystripe and Millie as they journey to find ThunderClan. It is drawn by James Barry. Plot summary The book opens with a short summary of the past events of the previous book, The Lost Warrior. Coming to the current time, Graystripe and his traveling companion, Millie, can see Highstones in the distance. As they are traveling through a corn field, a combine pursues them. Graystripe and Millie are separated as they flee from the monster. Graystripe manages to get to a nearby barn, and asks for help from the cats inhabiting the barn. The barn cats agree to help Graystripe find Millie. They find Millie and learn the hard corn leaves cut and damaged Millie's eyes. Graystripe and Millie are allowed to stay until she recovers. Husker, one of the barn cats explains to the two cats that they used to live in the nearby Twoleg nest (human house). Unfortunately, the Twolegs (humans) died, and a new family moved in. The new residents disliked the cats, so they were chased out. They had lived in the barn ever since and had to deal with the Twoleg's dogs. Graystripe and Millie face the pet dogs of the family after they wander into the barn. Millie can speak dog and is able to send the dogs away. The barn cats are amazed by Millie's ability and she teaches them how to speak dog. A few days later, Millie and Graystripe see a Twoleg kit in pursuit of a frog. She approaches dangerously close to the edge of a pond, almost falling into it. Graystripe manages to catch the child's attention and lead her away. The Twoleg's parents are very grateful to the cats. Over time, the Twolegs accept the barn cats as well and even adopt them as their kittypets through a plan of Graystripe's. The two travelers continue their route towards home. However, when they arrive at the forest, they find the territory is destroyed and ThunderClan is gone. Pre-release history HarperCollins and TokyoPop had agreed to publish a trilogy of Graystripe manga volumes, announced in February 2007. It was written by Erin Hunter and Dan Jolley, and illustrated by James L. Barry Artist's Portfolio. Publication history Warrior's Refuge was launched on December 26, 2007. Released on the same day was Dark River, the second book in the Warriors: Power of Three series. Warrior's Refuge has only been published as a paperback. Critical reception School Library Journal gave the book a mixed review praising \\"Millie's bravery\\", but also criticizing how scratchy text used when humans talk seems very odd when used with the toddlers. The review also criticized how the \\"artwork is merely competent and the story (which was not written by Hunter) is slight\\".

Its location was south of Fakenham between the villages of Tittleshall and Whissonsett. There are over 200 deserted villages in Norfolk, but most sites have been destroyed by ploughing, the pressures of two world wars or other agricultural uses. Only a few still have impressive surface remains. The earthworks at Godwick are well preserved because the site is grazed by sheep and has never been disturbed. Today it is one of the best surviving examples in the county and the only one open to the public. There is agreement between the owner and English Heritage over the opening and the management of the site, which is open between April and September from 9:30 am until dusk. On site there are information panels with displays of aerial photographs, maps and interpretation plans of this lost village. The earthworks are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is an offence to disturb the site or use metal detectors without the written permission of English Heritage. Origins Godwick was first settled in the Anglo Saxon period. By the 15thAlan Davison, Deserted Villages in Norfolk p. 69 century Godwick was a small village which was a relatively stable community, but was comparatively poor alongside neighbouring settlements. It was in the 15th century that the village declined sharply. A series of bad harvests, and the difficulty of cultivating the heavy boulder clay soil, eventually proved too much for the dwindling population. In 1428 there were under ten households.Alan Davison, Deserted Villages in Norfolk p. 69 By 1508 a survey taken showed that of 18 properties on the north side of the main street, 11 were empty and three had no land holdings attached. The same survey showed that a church lay to the south and there was also a watermill with a millpond. By 1595 further decay left Godwick virtually deserted. Its final stages of decay were recorded in an estate map of 1596 when only three or four houses remained and the church tower had collapsed. The Village Today What remains of the medieval village today, consisted of a sunken way running east to west with two other roads running off to the south. Along both sides of the street can be seen banks and ditches separating individual house plots. About ten of these still remain to be seen. The church stood within a similar enclosure in an angle between the streets. At the eastern end of the site, the village street ran along a dam holding back a millpond with a small watermill at the far end. The line of the dam is now covered by farm buildings. In 1981 a remaining part of the church tower survived a collapse. The 13th-century church tower had been raised as a brick and flint folly when the church was pulled down in the 17th century. This folly may well have formed part of a scheme of landscape architecture for the later Godwick Manor. Inspection of the 1981 collapse found evidence of a Norman church amongst the rubble. Also still to be seen on the site is a large 13th-century red-brick barn with an elaborate fa√ßade, built over the line of the street. During the reign of Charles II, 200 men were garrisoned there and although access is barred, it is possible to walk round it and enjoy its beautiful windows. The Later Godwick Manor In 1585, in the middle of the deserted village, Sir Edward Coke, Chief Justice and Attorney General to Elizabeth I, built a fine brick manor house, having purchased the estate in 1580. The ruins of the house, which was E-shaped with an impressive two-storey porch and windows, were pulled down in 1962. Its square outline can just be picked out as slight humps in the grass. It had a walled yard and entrance to the north, and around the hall a pattern of formal gardens and enclosures was laid out. Godwick Manor was the birthplace of Admiral Sir William Hoste.

Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284 (1986), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court reversed the lower court's finding and overturned the petitioner's conviction, on the grounds that it was fundamentally unfair for the prosecutor to comment during the court proceedings on the petitioner's silence invoked as a result of a Miranda warning. Background After his arrest in Florida for sexual battery, Greenfield was given three separate Miranda warnings. Each time, he exercised his right to remain silent and requested to speak with an attorney before answering questions. At his trial in the Circuit Court for Sarasota County, the respondent pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. During closing arguments in the Florida trial court, the prosecutor reviewed the police officer's testimony, over defense counsel's objection, arguing that Greenfield's silence after receiving Miranda warnings was evidence of his sanity. The testimony described the occasions when respondent had exercised his right to remain silent. The prosecutor suggested that respondent's repeated refusals to answer questions without first consulting an attorney \\"demonstrated a degree of comprehension that was inconsistent with his claim of insanity\\".. Greenfield then unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, by suing the Florida Department of Corrections and its secretary, Louie L. Wainwright, arguing that the prosecutor's use of his silence violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as construed in Doyle v. Ohio (1976). The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the general rule precluding a prosecutor from commenting on a defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent did not apply to a case in which an insanity plea was filed. Decision The Court held that the prosecutor's use of respondent's post-arrest, post-Miranda warnings silence as evidence of sanity violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Originally a salt manufacturer in the Kanawha Salines (renamed Malden), Ruffner served several terms in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Kanawha County before resigning as he became the company's agent in Louisville, Kentucky, but returned to Virginia in 1857. Although a slaveowner and with relatives for fought for the Confederacy, Ruffner became a prominent Unionist, represented Kanawha County during the Wheeling Conventions, initial West Virginia Constitutional Convention, and first West Virginia House of Delegates during the American Civil War. Fellow legislators named him Major General of the state's militia in 1863, but he declined to accept a commission in the Union Army because salt manufacture was also crucial to the war effort. After the war, General Ruffner suffered a debilitating injury trying to avert a mob attack and became known as a mentor of Booker T. Washington, his former houseboy.Lewis RuffnerWashington, Booker T. (1901). Up From Slavery: An Autobiography, p. 93. Early and family life On October 1, 1797, the former Mennonite minister's daughter, Anna Brombach Ruffner (1766-1852) gave birth to Lewis Ruffner, who became the first white child born in Kanawha County, in what became West Virginia in his lifetime.Stan Cohen, Kanawha County Images: A Bicentennial History 1788-1988 (Pictorial Histories Publishing Company 1987) p. 15 Their father David Ruffner (1767-1843) was descended from German or Swiss emigrants. His father (Lewis' grandfather), Joseph Ruffner Sr., had farmed near Luray, Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley and in 1794 bought land across the Appalachian Mountains in the Kanawha River Valley from John Dickinson, including a famous salt spring. After visiting the property the following year, he moved to the Kanawha Valley, joined within a year by his five sons, daughter and their families. Joseph Ruffner bought additional land nearby, as well as the defensive Clendenin Blockhouse,https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=23013 into which his firstborn son David Ruffner moved with his wife and children in 1796 (and in which Lewis Ruffner was born).https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/138 The blockhouse was eventually sold to James Wilson, who would later succeed Lewis Ruffner in the Virginia legislature. Meanwhile, when Joseph Ruffner Sr. died in 1803, his property was divided among his sons David (Lewis's father), Daniel, Joseph Jr., Samuel, Abraham and Tobias.Ruth Woods Dayton, Pioneers and their Homes on Upper Kanawha pp. 122-123https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/138 David Ruffner received the property closest to the future city of Charleston (the whole bottom from the mouth of Campbell's Creek to the cross line above Malden), including the famous salt lick, which Joseph Sr. had allowed Elisha Brooks to lease and try to develop. Soon, David and his brother Joseph Jr. decided to develop it themselves, and after resolving lawsuits involving Dickinson's heirs as well as their brother Abraham's share sold to Andrew Donnally Jr.John Edmund Stealey III, \\"the Salt Industry of the Great Kanawha Valley of Virginia: a Study in Ante-Bellum Commerce (West Virginia University PhD thesis 1970 available through University Microfilms pp. 3-7 In 1805 David Ruffner bought a mill and house from George Alderson and moved his family to the \\"Kanawha Salines\\" (renamed \\"Malden\\" in the 1850s), where he began developing the salt works (a/k/a salines).W.H.

The slave population was 1,717 in 1830 and reached its highest census-recorded number at 3,140 slaves in 1850, many of them leased and purchased in Kentucky or Eastern Virginia.Stealey pp. 429-433 By 1810, the 11 salt furnaces in the Kanawha valley led national salt production, producing 540,000 bushels annually of the key ingredient needed to preserve meat.Stealey p. 23 Meanwhile, between 1799 and 1812 (when Joseph Jr. moved to Cincinnati), Kanawha County voters several times elected David Ruffner as one of their two representatives (on a part- time basis) in the Virginia House of Delegates. By 1815 (with demand soaring because the war made British salt unavailable), the number of salt furnaces in the Kanawa Valley had reached 52 and extended four miles below and 3 miles above the original Ruffner operation, and wood to fire the boiling evaporation vats was becoming scarce, until David Ruffner managed to convert that part of the operation to coal, which was discovered nearby. In 1817, David (sometimes referred to using the honorific \\"Colonel\\") and his brothers Joseph Jr and Daniel Ruffner were among the founders of the Kanawha Salt Company, a local trust or salt production monopoly formed at the instigation of lawyer Joseph Lovell, with whom Lewis Ruffner would later serve in the legislature.Dayton pp. 123-125 During his father's development of the salt industry, young Lewis Ruffner attended various schools, first one in Charleston run by Herbert P. Gaines and later by Levi Welch, then in 1808 he went to a school in Scott County, Kentucky, and in 1812 was sent to Rev. John McElhenny's academy in Lewisburg.https://www.presbyteriansofthepast.com/2016/06/07/john- mcelhenney-1781-1871/ After the War of 1812 ended in early 1815, Lewis Ruffner continued his studies in Cincinnati. In 1816 Lewis was sent to Lexington, Virginia to study at Washington College (later Washington and Lee University) for two years, following a course laid by his elder brother Henry Ruffner, who became a Presbyterian minister and built a church in his hometown before returning to Washington College to teach and serve as its president.George W. Atkinson, History of Kanawha County (Charleston, West Virginia 1876; West Virginia Genealogical Society reprint 1994) p. 303Hedrick at https://sites.rootsweb.com/~wvkanawh/bios/r/ruffner2.html On November 20, 1826, Lewis Ruffner married Elizabeth Shrewsbury, daughter of another early saline manufacturer, Joel Shrewsbury, and who bore David Henry Ruffner (1835-1862), Lewis Ruffner Jr. (1837-1910), Joel S. Ruffner (1840-1908), and two daughters who survived to adulthood.Hedrick at https://sites.rootsweb.com/~wvkanawh/bios/r/ruffner2.html Almost a year after her death in January 1843, Lewis Ruffner married Viola (n√©e Knapp) Ruffner (1812-1903), a Vermont-born schoolteacher in Hamilton County, Ohio on December 2, 1843. They would have son Ernest Howard Ruffner (1845-1937) and daughter Stella Blanche Ruffner Wiley (1849-1932). Lewis Ruffner's granddaughter (Lewis Jr's daughter), Patti Ruffner Jacobs, became a prominent suffragist in Birmingham, Alabama. Career In 1818, having completed his education, Lewis Ruffner taught school for a year, then joined in his father's salt operations, which became his career. In the first three years he made several innovations, including a new furnace to better use coal and using a steam engine to drill wells, and took over the business from his father in 1823 (although father his David Ruffner would become judge of the county court and live another two decades). They managed to secure protective tariffs after severe problems circa 1825 due to vessels using foreign salt as ballast, and after George H. Patrrick of New York developed a new process to remove the red from the evaporated salt, the salt business saw its greatest prosperity (despite an unfavorable sketch of Kanawha County by Anne Royall in a book published in 1826).Dayton pp. 127-130 Like his father, Lewis Ruffner won election as one of Kanawha County's two representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his first term, which began in 1821, he served alongside Joseph Lovell (who had helped his father, uncles and neighbors establish the Kanawha Salt Company). However, Lewis Ruffner was not re-elected until 1825, when he replaced Lovell as one of Kanawha County's delegates, then won re-election the following year.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 309, 329, 334 He did not seek reelection in 1828, perhaps in part because he was elected a local magistrate, a post he held until he moved to Louisville, Kentucky in 1845.Atkinson p. 304 His father had died in 1843, and Louis Ruffner continued in the salt trade in Louisville, as agent for the Kanawha Salt trust now facing competition from salines in Kentucky, Illinois, Ohio as well as mines in New York. Joel Shrewsbury, William Dickenson, John Dickinson Lewis and Lewis Ruffner were sometimes called the \\"Salt Kings of Kanawha\\".https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1897 In Louisville, Lewis Ruffner attended the Presbyterian Church led by Dr. Stuart Robinson. In 1846, the Kanawha salt business had its peak year, producing over 3 million bushels, which with associated barrel production, lumber, boat building and shipping businesses made Malden one of Virginia's wealthiest communities, albeit with considerable pollution, thus many of the wealthiest producers built homes in Charleston downriver.Cohen p. 37 In 1847, four years after their father's death, his brother Rev. Henry Ruffner published a controversial pamphlet that argued slavery was impeding Virginia's economic development, and after resigning as president of Washington College, spent some time with Lewis and his family in Louisville, before himself returning to Malden. On February 28, 1849, Lewis Ruffner joined an emancipation society in Louisville.Larry L. Rowe, History Tour of Old Malden Virginia and West Virginia, available at https://www.larrylrowe.com In 1840 Lewis Ruffner owned 20 slaves in Kanawha County,1840 U.S. Federal Census for District 29, Kanawha County, Virginia pp. 74-75 of 129 and in 1850 owned 47 slaves there,1850 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedules for District 29, Kanawha County, Virginia p. 34 of 35 and probably indirectly owned others, although not a partner in the county's largest slaveholder, the Shrewsbury and Dickinson saltworks. In 1857 Lewis Ruffner returned to Malden to manage the salt operations, as a depression which had hit the salt industry, driving all but nine salt manufacturing companies out of business by 1860 and reducing the county's slave population to 2,184 persons.Stealey p. 470 In the 1860 census, Lewis Ruffner and his wife, son and daughter lived with his cousin Silas Ruffner (Tobias Ruffner's son and a decade his junior) and his wife Eliza in Kanawha County.1860 U.S. Federal Census for Kanawha County, Virginia family 1768 p. 271 of 321 Although a slaveowner and with relatives for fought for the Confederacy, Ruffner became a prominent Unionist, leading recruitment of a home guard unit at Malden, as well as represented Kanawha County during the Wheeling Conventions, initial West Virginia Constitutional Convention, and first West Virginia House of Delegates during the American Civil War.Leonard pp. 490, 492, 494 Fellow legislators named him Major General of the state's militia in 1863 (hence references to him as \\"General Ruffner\\"), but he declined to accept a commission in the Union Army, and salt manufacture was also crucial to the war effort.Atkinson p. 304-305George W. Atkinson and Alvara Franklin Gibbons, Prominent Men of West Virginia (W.L. Callin 1890), available at https://archive.org/details/prominentmenwes00gibbgoog/page/n354 Meanwhile, Confederates occupied the salt works in late 1862, and his son David Henry Ruffner died that December. Union forces destroyed the salt works to stop further shipments of the valuable commodity to the Confederacy, although John P. Hale (who had joined the Confederate Army in 1861) reorganized it in 1864, with \\"Gen. L. Ruffner\\" as \\"General Advisory Agent\\".Cohen p. 37, including picture of Cincinnati-published handbill of 1864 Postwar life and Booker T. Washington As war ended, General Ruffner ceased political activity, perhaps compounded by an injury he received in 1868, when he tried to remonstrate with a mob of about 100 white men upset with labor competition and specifically with four or five black men who arrived in Malden from his land in Tinkerville to view a trial. A thrown stone hit Ruffner just above his ear. He fell unconscious and never fully recovered, suffering many memory and vision problems, and needing crutches to walk. In 1873, he turned over his business affairs to his son Lewis Ruffner Jr. (who had returned to Malden after selling salt in St. Louis, Missouri and Evansville, Indiana) and other trustees for the benefit of his children, reserving only an annuity for himself and his wife.Hedrick at https://sites.rootsweb.com/~wvkanawh/bios/r/ruffner2.html During the war, the stepfather of Booker T. Washington, who had been a leased slave at the salt works, returned with his newly emancipated family to join them. Young Washington worked at several manual jobs, including at the salt works, before the General and his (second) wife hired him as a houseboy. According to the first of Washington's autobiographies, Up From Slavery, Mrs. Ruffner had a harsh reputation for her rigid and strict manner, was feared by her servants and could only keep temporary employees due to her demands and expectations. Conservative and hardworking, she valued education, cleanliness, promptness, and honesty above all else. She taught Washington the value of a dollar, and encouraged him to further his schooling, allowing him to attend school for an hour each day. Washington expresses his extreme respect and utmost regard for Ruffner, calling her \\"one of the best friends I ever had.\\"Washington, Booker T. (1901). Up From Slavery: An Autobiography ch. 3 available at http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/WASHINGTON/ch03.html Mrs. Ruffner inspired Washington to seek an education and the couple and famous African American educator became lifelong friends. In 1872 Washington left Malden to attend Hampton Institute at the age of sixteen.Booker T.

The Kanawha saltworks never recovered from the increased competition of the 1850s, wartime depredations and the crash of 1873. Furthermore, a group of businessmen swindled the Kanawha Salt Company in 1882. By 1890 only the J.Q. Dickinson works continued saltmaking in Malden, ceasing production in 1945.Cohen pp. 37, 45 In modern times, the Ruffner and Washington families remain good friends, and had a reunion in Charleston, West Virginia in 2002.

Description This is a brome grass which is native to the Mediterranean but has been introduced to much of the rest of the world. It does best in areas with a Mediterranean climate, such as California and parts of southern Australia, but it is quite tolerant of many climates. Ripgut brome is a winter annual which grows throughout winter and spring and matures in the summer. The adult plant is one to three feet in height with hairy, rough leaves about a centimeter wide. The membranous ligule is prominent, white in color with spiky hairs. The wide panicle nods like that of an oat plant, and it bears a large, splayed spikelet with a very long awn which can exceed five centimeters in length. The seeds easily break out of the spikelet. They are very sharp and very rough due to tiny barb-like hairs that face backwards, allowing the seed to catch and lodge like a fish hook. This characteristic makes the seeds a danger to animals, which can easily get a seed lodged in a paw or eye. Motion can cause the seed to work itself deeply into flesh. This is one of several grass species known to pet owners as \\"foxtails\\", a backyard hazard for outdoor cats and dogs. Invasive species Ripgut brome can substantially reduce yields when it invades wheat fields. It has naturalized in some areas and is considered a troublesome noxious weed in others. Bromus diandrus is an invasive species in California native habitats. This brome grass is a troublesome weed in cereal crops and natural pasture lands. The life cycle of B. diandrus helps it to grow in wheat fields in which it can grow for most of the season without being noticed. Once the grass starts flowering, the open panicle seed head shows the infestation. Dastgheib F. & Poole N. 2010. Seed biology of brome grass weeds (Bromus diandrus and B. hordeaceus) and effects of land management. New Zealand Plant Protection 63: 78-83 The damage to wheat crop is through both strong competition, lowering yield, and seed contamination, lowering quality.Bromus diandrus infestation in wheat, NZ Ripgut brome is also troublesome in rangeland if it establishes in high numbers. The grass is of low nutritional value to livestock. Brome seeds can also mix with sheep wool and lower its value. Moreover, sharp awns of ripe seeds can penetrate sheep's skin into the flesh causing pain and lowering carcass value. If ingested, the strong awns can cause injury to sheep's mouth and even intestine,Edgar E. & Connor H.E. 2000. Flora of New Zealand, Vol. V, Grasses. P. 362-8 hence the name \\"ripgut\\". Similar species Bromus rigidus, known as rigid brome, is very similar in morphology to ripgut brome but differs from the latter in its panicle structure and the callus-scar of its caryopsis. The two species have some differences in their germination behaviour as well.Kleemann S. G. L. & Gill G. S. 2008. Differences in the distribution and seed germination behaviour of populations of Bromus rigidus and Bromus diandrus in South Australia: adaptations to habitat and implications for weed management. Australian Journal of Agricultural Research 57(2) 213‚Äì219 doi:10.1071/AR05200 Bromus sterilis, or sterile brome, is similar in most morphological features. It is a slightly smaller plant which can be an annual or a biennial plant. Bromus hordeaceus, known as soft brome, is similar in early growth stages with smaller leaf blades. The seed head is an erect panicle, smaller than B. diandrus with much smaller seeds and much shorter awns.

It is noteworthy for taking a more openly political approach than any of Conn's previous albums, being particularly critical of George Bush and the Iraq War. Musically the album focuses mostly on a number of 70s styles, from early-decade prog pseudo-symphonies to late decade disco-rock fusion and funk. The album was recorded at Soma Studios, Chicago, Illinois in 2003. Reception The Homeland was met with mostly positive reviews. The Columbus FreePress gave it a glowing review, writing \\"It is rare when an album sets out to achieve such lofty goals as The Homeland. It‚Äôs even more rare when the artist actually hits the mark on all levels.\\" Uncut magazine gave the album 4/5 stars, calling Conn \\"witty and sharp\\", and stating that he can \\"tell a tale with aplomb\\".

In addition the song also reached No. 71 on the Pop charts, and No. 16 on the Adult Contemporary charts that year. This album shows Anderson's new direction into placing her voice into more pop-oriented songs, including \\"Cry\\" (originally a No. 1 pop hit for Johnnie Ray in 1951). After having a No. 1 country and pop hit in late 1970, \\"(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden\\", her record company set her records out more for the Pop market, and never looked back. This helped Lynn Anderson gain the biggest success she ever had for a number of years. Thus, this left Anderson from recording the hard country material she recorded for her late 1960s albums under Chart Records. Husband Glenn Sutton helped produce this album with producing legend, Clive Davis. Most of the songs featured here are pop songs, like the Addrisi Brothers' \\"We've Got to Get It on Again\\" and Sonny & Cher's \\"When You Say Love\\". With the help of legendary country producer, Billy Sherrill, Sutton wrote some of the songs for this album, some of which had been previously hits for country singers, like Barbara Mandrell's \\"Tonight My Baby's Coming Home\\".

Her projects, based on a unified approach to knowledge, encompass several disciplines and media including astronomy, land art, geoglyphs, architecture, design, digital models, photography and video. Daniela Bertol was born and grew up in Rome, where she earned a master's degree in Architecture; in 1985 she moved to the United States. Bertol's early projects explored geometric space and virtual environments using digital model, where geometric forms evolved in organic components, similar to shapes found in nature. Bertol founded space ink in 1989 as a multidisciplinary laboratory embracing experimentally built and published projects as well as theoretical works focusing on the transformation of architecture and its integration with digital space. The vision that technological advancements should establish continuity with the past‚Äîinstead of creating a fracture‚Äîhas been expressed in architectural and educational projects, art installations, artwork, furniture and graphic design. Bertol's most recent project ---and work in progress--- is Sky Spirals, a series of places devoted to sustainable design: the shaping of the landscape based on intersecting spirals follow solar and celestial alignments . Sky Spirals began as a conceptual work based on digital models, maps and aerial photos. As the work developed, the virtual model and diagrams were translated to a real physical site in Claverack, New York (USA). They became Sun Farm, the first site of the Sky Spirals concepts. The interest in sustainable architecture has inspired solar based design, such as the house at Sun Farm: contemporary architectural vocabulary and materials re-propose design intention from early civilizations. Bertol's design vision integrates principles of eastern philosophies and practices with contemporary architectural theories and research. Urdhva dhanurasana (wheel pose) A lifelong yoga practitioner (and certified yoga teacher) she integrates spiritual practices in her artist and design work: several land art sculptures provide the path of walking meditations and yoga poses are included in the perception of architectural spaces.

It was founded on 29 July 2006, and is located beside the Spanish Arch. The official website for the museum was launched on 27 November 2008. Spanish Arch  Origin and development  Galway City Museum was founded in the mid-1970s. It was originally located in Comerford House, which prior to this had been the home of artist Clare Sheridan. The museum began as a residual collection of medieval stones from the city, acquired by Sheridan. Curated by Etienne Ryan, Michael Keaney, Bill Scanlan and Jim Higgins the museum built up a general folklife, industrial and militia collection.View of Comerford House and Spanish Arch beside the River Corrib Comerford House Comerford House is a historic property that was donated to the Galway City Council by the Comerford family for the intention of community care and purpose. The house was built c. 1800 as a private house, originally lived in by the Comerford family and later by the Greenwood family. Clare Consuelo Sheridan (1885‚Äì1970), sculptor, journalist, writer and first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill, lived at Comerford House between the years 1948 and 1954. The building became part of Galway Corporation‚Äôs administration offices for a period, before Galway City Museum was founded in 1976. This museum closed in 2004. New museum building In April 2007 a new purpose built museum building was opened, behind the site of the old museum at Comerford House. The new Galway City Museum project was the initiative of Galway City Council to advance the cultural and heritage life of Galway City. The building was designed by Ciaran O‚ÄôConnor and Ger Harvey, architects with the Office of Public Works, who were contracted by the Galway City Council. The new museum is located along the River Corrib beside the Spanish Arch, a protected monument which formed part of the defensive medieval wall that once surrounded the city of Galway. The design of the building creates a plaza or square between the museum and the Spanish Arch; a public space which is at times used for civic events.Partial View of the Galway City Museum from the Spanish Arch The plan of the museum is composed in an ‚ÄòL‚Äô shape and was restricted to three levels in order to maintain the scale of the surrounding buildings. The project was completed in 2006 and resulted in a space of 2,100 metres squared with a final cost of ‚Ç¨6,890,000. The architects of the building won the Bank of Ireland Opus Architectural Award for their design in 2006.

The full name is a backronym from 'quid', a slang term for the British Pound. The campaign stated that Travelex was launching a new form of money for space tourists that had no sharp edges, was chemically inert, and had other advantages over paper money. The QUID After coming up with the idea of a space-money campaign, talkPR and Travelex contacted the National Space Centre, whose employees were presented with a number of mockups made by the campaign artists and were asked to select one. The end result was a series of circular clear discs with colored centers, symbolizing the eight planets of the Solar System inside, and denominations ranging from 1 to 10. Each quid coin would have its own unique code number, similar to the serial number on paper currency, to allow tracking, and to prevent counterfeiting. Travelex stated it planned to work with the Bank of England to begin registering the Quid as possible legal currency in the future. On October 5, 2007, a one-page press statement announcing the QUID was released and placed on the United Press International press release newswire. The campaign was launched in the midst of intense press coverage of the Virgin Galactic news. The story was picked up by major news agencies in the UK, and soon after, the US. Science magazines and technological blog writers weighed in on the topic, calling it \\"useless\\" and \\"nonsense\\", further spreading the story. Statements by members of the NSC and the University of Leicester (who started the NSC) were added to the campaign release.

She learned the piano at school, and then studied with composer Alan Bush while taking odd jobs in London, including working as a bus conductor. In the mid-1960s she began working with her sister Shirley, who was establishing a reputation as a leading folk singer. She arranged some of Shirley's songs and, on the album Sweet Primeroses, accompanied her on portative organ. Further work with Shirley followed: Shirley said \\"You could launch yourself off on a Dolly arrangement.\\" In 1968 they produced the album Anthems in Eden, commissioned by BBC Radio and written for a six-piece early music consort directed by David Munrow, and regularly toured together. Dolly also worked as a musician and arranger with other singers and bands, including The Incredible String Band on The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter (1967), Matthews' Southern Comfort on their debut album (1969), and Peter Bellamy on the ballad opera The Transports (1977). By the late 1970s she retreated from touring and live concerts, and earned a living from gardening. Her last recordings were with Shirley on the album For As Many as Will (1978).

The abbey lies on an island in the River Blackwater. The monks of the monastery helped co- edit Collectio canonum Hibernensis in the 8th century. It came under the control of the Augustinian canons in the 12th century before being seized by the English Crown during the Reformation and gradually falling into ruin. Name of the monastery The Irish name for the island is Dairinis, which can be translated as \\"Oak Island\\".Irish Place Names. Gill & MacMillan, 1994, . Early Middle Ages text sources also use this name for the abbey. However, since there was another monastery island of that name in Wexford, the name of the founder, M√°el Anfaid, was added to differentiate between the two.Siehe die Glosse zum 14. August in der Martyriologie des Oengus, Seite 184 unten in der Ausgabe von Whitley Stokes. In later centuries, the old Irish name was dropped and only the founder's name was used. This name was later anglicised to Molana.On the map sheet 81 from the Discovery Series of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, , is the monastery Molana Abbey called (map grid position X 080,828). Leask is on page 146 the term Abbey in quotation marks and points out immediately afterwards to the rank of priory. Geographic location The location of Molana Abbey The monastery is located on a former river island in the Blackwater River but was connected to the mainland in 1806 by the construction of two dams on the west side of the mainland.The Occupation of Celtic sites in Ireland by the Canons Regular of St Augustine and the Cistercians . Cistercian Publications, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 1982, The site is only a few kilometers from the river mouth and the natural port of Youghal on the south coast of Ireland. The access to waterways in the early Middle Ages was of great importance as it gave easy access to travel to monasteries in Ireland, Britain, and Brittany. It is thought the monks at Molana used currachs for this purpose.See the sixth chapter from the work of Meike Blackwell: Ships in Early Irish History . Ballinakella Press, 1992, According to some traditions, it is known that a sea voyage in the early Christian period between Southern Ireland and Brittany could be completed in three days and nights.See the article by L√©on Fleuriot . The Brittany and the Bretons in the relations between the Celtic countries and continental Europe from IV to X. century . Edited by Heinz R. Dopsch and Juffinger Band Virgil of Salzburg , pages 52-58 Salzburg., 1985 History The 12th-century Norman military commander Raymond FitzGerald, who regularly visited and is buried in the monastery A disciple of St. Carthage, called M√°el Anfaid, founded the monastery on an island called Dair Inis on the River Blackwater in the sixth century.See Sir James Ware, pages 195‚Äì196. Little is known of the founder but it is thought he could have lived to at least 608 AD. This hypothesis is discussed by Peter O'Dwyer on page 37. The corresponding entries in the annals are U609.1 at the Annals of Ulster or M605.3 at the Annals of the Four Masters. The date has been corrected according to the table work of Daniel P. Mc Carthy: The Chronology of the Irish Annals , 1998 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Vol 98C, pages 203‚Äì255. The early monastery was recorded as having an extensive library including Greek Vulgate and African councils resolutions.See introduction in Hermann Wasserschleben: The Irish canon collection. Bernhard Tauchnitz, Leipzig, 2nd edition, 1885th Although it can also be assumed that, as with many other Irish monasteries, Molana was a victim of raids by Vikings, no such records of any attacks have survived. In particular, the prominent location near the mouth of the River Blackwater makes the chances of an attack even likelier.See page 143 by Patrick Power in the essay from 1932. The entry M819.4 in the Annals of the Four Masters refers to Dairinis in Wexford, as Patrick Power also points out. This is also implicitly an answer to the corresponding statement in the article by Flood, emanating from a busy raid. Following the Norman Invasion of Ireland in 1169, the monks befriended Raymond Fitzgerald, who was one of the Norman commanders of the invasion. FitzGerald provided support to the monastery and it is thought he was buried there some time between 1185 and 1198.Gwynn Hadcock 1970, pg 187 Molana was refounded as a house of Augustinian canons in the 12th century and was extensively rebuilt in the 13th century. By 1462 the monastery was reported to still have a large number of monks caring for the poor and sick, despite it being in poor structural condition. Later, in 1475, it was reported that the monastery was still impoverished but continuing to function. During the Reformation all monasteries in the territory of Henry VIII were dissolved and examined. The Crown report compiled in 1541 stated the monastery consisted of a church, cloister and all that was necessary for the operation of agriculture, including 380 acres of land, three weirs for catching salmon and a water mill. The property had an estimated value of 26 pounds and 15 shillings.Gwynn pg.187 On 21 December 1550, ownership of the monastery as a fief fell to James FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond.See page 3 in the article by Flood. Flood assumed that the canons could stay to 1560. The Earl allowed continuation of the monastic life but the Desmond Rebellions caused the monastery to be re-seized by the English Crown, whose soldiers desecrated the church and burned a portrait of the monastery's founder when they visited the island in 1580.See page 4 in the article by Flood. Flood refers to page 43 of the book by Hayman: Memorials of Youghal, 1863, which again refers to a book of the Jesuit John Coppinger: The Theatre of Catholic and Protestant religion of 1620. (The latter date was taken from books.google.com.) By 1600 the monastery was abandoned and already overgrown with so much ivy that it was nearly impossible to examine the architectural features. Gradually the buildings fell further into ruin. The land and ruins were owned by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington up to the mid-eighteenth century when it passed to the Smyth family who built a nearby manor named Ballynatray House complete with a surrounding park in 1795. To integrate the ruins of the monastery into the park, two dams were built in 1806, which since then connect the island to the mainland. The monastery and its associated manor were later sold several times and is still in private ownership to this day.The article of 21 March 2003 of the Irish Examiner reported the intention to sell the former owner Serge and Henriette Boussevain: Another article of 25 March 2004 reported by the sale: The grounds of Ballynatray House are open to the public for a few hours on certain days of the week. Architecture Pointed Windows on the north side of the choir, constructed in the 13th century early English style Not much is known about the buildings from the early Christian era. In general it can be assumed that in Ireland at the time, the nearest building materials were used. The name of the island would suggest that oak trees were widely available locally so the early monastery was probably constructed of this. Only later, but well before Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century, were churches being widely constructed using stone. The nave of the monasteries church dates back to this time just before the invasion and is 17.07m in length and 7.47m in width.The measurements were taken from the article by Patrick Power from 1932. It is typical for this time period of construction, the preferred method was the use of fairly large stones if possible, which were carefully selected and arranged so that a relatively high degree of accuracy was achieved.Harold G. Leask: Irish Churches and Monastic Buildings. Band 1, Dundalgan Press, 1955, Page 51 to 53. All other preserved buildings were erected in the 13th century with some later additions.This dating was carried out by Patrick Power in his work from 1932. The choir windows are 4.57 m high, 2.08 m wide and narrow outwards to 0.56 m. With six southern chancel windows, a large east window and four northern chancel windows, the choir area would have been very full of light. In comparison, the old nave must have been dark. The east wing was two storeys. The ground floor shut immediately to the choir vestry. Further south was followed by other areas with the chapter house and the staircase that gave access to the dormitory on the top floor. The chapter house had three-part window with a height of 1.68 m and an inner width of 1.37 m. The refectory was 21.49 m in length and 6.17 m in width, which took up the entire southern wing. Large parts of the southern wall are collapsed today. However, a section with a window of the early English style was preserved on the south side, and equipped with an arched window, which apparently served as a lectern. Together with the two windows in the west gable, the room was well supplied with good light. Some structural changes can be attributed to the activities of the Smyth family at the beginning of the 19th century. These include a pointed arch entrance on the north side of the old church hall, a historically incorrect statue of the founder M√°el Anfaid as an Augustinian Canons Regular and a memorial plaque on the east pediment of the refectory which claims to be the burial place of Raymond Fitzgerald although it is thought he was buried elsewhere in the monastery.See the essay from 1932 by Patrick Power, pg. 150 and 151 See also *List of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Cork) *Rincrew Abbey *Youghal *Youghal Priory *North Abbey, Youghal *South Abbey, Youghal References Category:Augustinian monasteries in the Republic of Ireland Category:Religion in County Waterford Category:Buildings and structures in County Waterford Category:Ruins in the Republic of Ireland Category:Christian monasteries established in the 6th century ","title":"Molana Abbey"},{"id":"13606789","text":"Tara Allain (born October 2, 1985) is Miss Maine for 2007.

It was signed in about 2011 when the single-point urban interchange at John Young and Osceola Parkways was completed. Until 1999, a truck bypass was signed around Downtown Kissimmee. It began where US 17-92 formerly turned from John Young Parkway onto West Emmett Street, and continued north in a straight line along John Young Parkway to US 192, where it turned east until it returned to US 17-92 at North Main Street (Orange Blossom Trail). The route existed from sometime during the 1980s until 1999, when US 17-92 itself was rerouted to bypass downtown Kissimmee. =Maitland truck route= US 17-92 Truck is designated to divert overheight truck traffic away from a low railroad bridge that carries the SunRail rail line over US 17-92 in southern Maitland. The route follows State Road 423 (Lee Road), Interstate 4, and State Road 414 (Maitland Boulevard) in Winter Park, Florida and Maitland. It formerly used Wymore Road and Lake Avenue (CR 438A) instead of I-4 and SR 414.

It is long and has been four- laned in various segments since 1970. =Myrtle Beach business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business, also known as Kings Highway, was established by 1967 when mainline US 17 was bypassed west of Murrells Inlet. In 1981, it was extended north to near Briarcliffe Acres, after mainline US 17 was placed on a new highway bypass route. The business loop connects: Murrells Inlet, Garden City, Surfside Beach, and Myrtle Beach. The road is also a major route during the Bi-Lo Marathon weekend; miles 2-6 and also 19-21 run through this highway during the marathon. North Carolina =Shallotte business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 1991 after the completion of the Shallotte Bypass. The business loop is in length and has the street name Main Street for its entire length. The middle segment is also concurrent with NC 130, which splits from Business US 17 in the north to travel to Whiteville and splits in the south to travel to Holden Beach. =Bolivia business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 1992 after the completion of the Bolivia Bypass. The business route follows the old alignment of US 17 through Bolivia, the small county seat of Brunswick County. This route is also called the Old Ocean Highway and passes through the center of Bolivia near its northern terminus. =Wilmington business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) is a business route through Wilmington. US 17 Bus was established in 1971, two years after US 17 was realigned onto new routing; it traversed along 3rd and Market Streets, between Dawson/Wooster and 16th/17th Streets. Market Street was part of the original alignment, but goes south instead of north along 3rd Street to meetup with US 17. In 1979, AASHTO officially recognized US 17 Bus. In 2005, AASHTO approved the US 17 Bus extension upon completion of and realignment of US 17 along the Wilmington bypass. On June 30, 2006, when the Wilmington bypass opened, US 17 Bus replaced segments of US 17: North along Market Street, between 16th/17th Streets and near Futch Creek Road, and south crossing the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge to Eagle Island. In May 2015, AASHTO approved a request to reroute US 17 back through Wilmington, following US 76 along Oleander Drive and Military Cutoff Road; the new alignment reduces the length of existing US 17 Bus to along 3rd Street and Market Street. In May 2017, US 17 Bus was officially reduced as approved by AASHTO. US 17 Bus shares brief concurrency with US 76 and US 421, while crossing over the Cape Fear River. It is also part of the Cape Fear Historic Byway, which features scenic urban areas, colonial-era streets, the USS North Carolina battleship and the city parks. ;Major intersections =Jacksonville business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 2006 after the completion of the Jacksonville Bypass, which rerouted US 17/NC 24 south and east around Jacksonville. The old alignment along Wilmington Highway and Marine Boulevard became US 17 Bus, with a short overlap with NC 24 Bus. =New Bern business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 2000 as a renumbering of mainline US 17 through downtown New Bern, via Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Neuse Boulevard, Broad Street, and Front Street. In 2011, the business loop was extended south as mainline US 17 was placed on new freeway west of New Bern. =Vanceboro business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 1961 when US 17 was rerouted, on bypass route, east of Vanceboro. US 17 Bus travels along Main Street, sharing of it with NC 43, since 1987. =Chocowinity-Washington business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 2011 when US 17 was rerouted, onto new freeway grade highway, bypassing east of Chocowinity and west of Washington. US 17 Bus follows the old alignment of US 17 through Chocowinity and along Bridge Street/Carolina Avenue in Washington. =Williamston business loop= Williamston U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 17A, which traversed through downtown Williamston, via Washington Street and Main Street. Between 1969-1977, US 17 Bus is split in the downtown area, northbound on Haughton Street and southbound on Elm Street. In 2003, US 17 Bus was extended that was formally US 17 when the new Williamston bypass was established. =Windsor bypass= U.S. Route 17 Bypass (US 17 By-Pass) was established in 2009 and is long. Beginning at the US 13/US 17 split, located southeast of Windsor, US 17 Bypass follows the preexisting expressway grade of US 13\\\\. At exit 215, US 13 splits and continues north, while US 17 Bypass continues on freeway grade highway till it re-merges with US 17, near mile marker 221. =Edenton business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 1977 as a renumbering of mainline US 17 through Edenton, via Queen Street and Broad Street. In 1996 it was rerouted along Virginia Road to Broad Street and removed routing through the downtown area and along Queen Street, becoming SR 1204\\\\. However, in 2012, NCDOT reversed course and reverted the business loop back to its original routing; thanks in part of not completing the formal route change package and distributing it (i.e. updating the TEAAS and road signs in the area). NC 32 shares a concurrency along Broad Street, in the downtown area. =Hertford- Winfall business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 1966 as a renumbering of mainline US 17 through Hertford (via Edenton Road Street, Dobbs Street and Church Street) and Winfall (via Creek Drive). NC 37 shares a concurrency from Winfall Boulevard to the Business loop's northern terminus. =Elizabeth City bypass= U.S. Route 17 Bypass (US 17 By-Pass) was established in 2004 and is a controlled-access highway bypass west of Elizabeth City. Unlike typical bypasses, a separate mainline US 17 continues along original 1953 bypass route (Hughes Boulevard), while a business route goes through downtown Elizabeth City. =Elizabeth City business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 17A through downtown Elizabeth City, via Ehringhaus Street and Road Street. The business loop has remained unchanged since its establishment. =Elizabeth City business truck route= Elizabeth City U.S. Route 17 Business Truck is a unique truck route specifically for the US 17 Business loop in Elizabeth City. Following US 158 west from the Camden Causeway and north along (mainline) US 17 to the junction with Business US 17\\\\. The bypassed segment of US 17 Business not only has a weight limit precluding most trucks over two axles, but also passes through historic residential areas. =South Mills business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus) was established in September, 1984 as a renumbering of mainline US 17 through South Mills, via Main Street. It is the northernmost US 17 Business in North Carolina. West of South Mills, it joins with NC 343 and continues north, rejoining with US 17. Virginia =Chesapeake business loop= View south along US 17 Bus. at SR 165 in Chesapeake An old alignment of US Route 17 along the Dismal Swamp Canal carries the US Route 17 Business designation north from the Dominion Boulevard intersection to Deep Creek, where US 17 Business crosses the canal on a small drawbridge, before proceeding north to rejoin US Route 17 at Interstate 64 (Exit 296). =Gloucester Courthouse business loop= View south along US 17 Bus. at SR 3 and SR 14 in Gloucester Courthouse US Route 17 Business through Gloucester Courthouse consists of a loop, Main Street, that travels through the historic courthouse district, intersecting State Routes 3 and 14. VA 14 multiplexes with US 17 Business on the northern leg back to US 17. Main Street is likely a former alignment of US Route 17, due to several US 17 shields on it that lack a Business banner. =Saluda business loop= View south at the north end of US 17 Bus. at US 17 in Saluda U.S. Route 17 Business in Saluda branches off of mainline US 17 (Tidewater Trail) to the northeast at Gloucester Road along with a concurrency with Virginia State Route 33. One block after the wye Virginia Secondary Route 618 joins the two routes from the intersection of Lovers Retreat Lane. At the intersection of General Puller Highway VA 33 turns right SSR 618 continues north onto Oakes Landing Road and BUS US 17 turns left. This segment also contains the name \\"School Street,\\" and runs west until reaching mainline US 17 once again. =Fredericksburg business loop= View north along US 17 Bus. and SR 2 north of SR 3 in Fredericksburg U.S. Business Route 17 through the vicinity of Fredericksburg, begins at the intersection of US 17 and Virginia State Route 2 southeast of Fredericksburg, where they both become Tidewater Trail. From there the road passes by Fredericksburg Country Club, Shannon Airport and the Fredericksburg Agricultural Fairgrounds. Within the city limits, Tidewater Trail becomes Dixon Street and crosses under the Blue and Gray Parkway interchange, then curves right before splitting onto southbound Princess Anne Street and northbound Caroline Street. Both streets cross under the Fredericksburg (VRE station), where US BUS 1 joins US BUS 17 along the same parallel one-way streets, until they reach Herndon Street and become a two-way street again at Princess Anne Street. US Bus 1 & 17 continues to run northwest until they reach US Route 1 where US BUS 1 terminates, but US BUS 17 joins and cross the Rappahannock River, and enters Falmouth. US BUS 17 leaves US 1 at the west end of Virginia State Route 218 where it runs northwest onto Warrenton Road before finally terminating at the north end of the I-95/US 17 multiplex at Exit 133-B. =Warrenton business loop= View south along US 17 Bus., just north of US 211 and US 29 Bus. in Warrenton U.S. Business Route 17 in Warrenton, Virginia is also multiplexed with U.S. Business Route 15 and U.S. Business Route 29, at least at the southern end. After James Madison Highway becomes Shirley Avenue, US Bus 15 leaves this concurrency at Falmouth Street. U.S. Route 211 joins the two Business routes as US BUS Route 211 runs east along Waterloo Street and US 211-BUS 17/29 become Broadview Avenue. As the triplex curves right, and intersects Roebling Street, it becomes Lee Highway, and US Bus 17 makes a left turn onto Broadview Avenue, a name it will keep until the intersection of Foxcroft Road and becomes James Madison Highway before terminating at the interchange with mainline US Route 17. =Marshall business loop= View south along US 17 Bus. at SR 710 in Marshall U.S. Business Route 17 through the vicinity of Marshall, Virginia runs northeast from Exit 27 on Interstate 66, partially along Virginia State Route 55 (Free State Road, West Main Street), then turns southeast onto Winchester Road as it reunites with US 17 at Exit 28 on I-66. Former Routes =Jacksonville alternate route= The Roosevelt Expressway is a spur of Interstate 10 (I-10; SR 8) west of downtown Jacksonville, in the U.S. state of Florida, built partially to freeway standards. It travels northeast from an intersection with Roosevelt Boulevard (U.S. Route 17 (US 17; SR 15), traveling parallel with nearby McDuff Avenue (SR 129), to a partial interchange with I-10. The road is designated as a spur of SR 15,FDOT GIS data and was formerly numbered State Road 15A.Florida Department of Transportation, General Highway Map, Duval County, Florida, May 1973, reprinted January 1980 It has also been ‚Äì and may still be ‚Äì an unsigned U.S. Route 17 Alternate (US 17 Alt.), which originally continued east on I-10 and north on I-95 to return to US 17 north of the Trout River. US 17 north at the interchange with the Roosevelt Expressway Roosevelt Expressway is the bypass built as a spur of I-10, which converted US 17 into a limited- access Expressway north of Blanding Boulevard (SR 21), bypassing the Post Street/College Street route that Roosevelt Boulevard used to travel through the Riverside and Avondale historic district, passing by McDuff Avenue (SR 129) to I-10 eastbound. The expressway is accessible southbound via I-10 west as a left exit (exit 361). The current design was preferred over the proposed River Oaks Freeway, which would have decimated the Avondale district. The partial interchanges with Blanding and I-10 reflect the nature of the original need of a bypass system. Intended to stimulate commerce and encourage connectivity to Jacksonville's downtown to and from the suburbs and Orange Park, while streamlining commutes and lessening the impact such travel was to potentially have on Jacksonville's oldest areas in the southwest side of town by removing high volume and chaotic redevelopment from the streets of Avondale and Lakeside Park, the area east of the Roosevelt Expressway is now protected in the form of a zoning overlay largely allowed by the basic design of this alternate route. Roosevelt Expressway has been signed in the last number of years as Roosevelt Boulevard, even though it's still in the JTA books as Expressway. It is part of the Blue Star Memorial Highway, and named for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In early 2006, the Florida Department of Transportation applied to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to reroute US 17 via the Roosevelt Expressway, I-10, I-95 and US 23\\\\. If this is accepted, US 17 Alt. will be eliminated. As of March 2007, it appears that US 17 has been rerouted. US 17 goes north on the Roosevelt Expressway, to east I-10 (SR 8), north on I-95, and east on Union Street (US 23) until Main Street and picking back up on its original course.American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials - An Application from the State Highway or Transportation Department of Florida for the Relocation of a U.S. Route 17. =Savannah alternate route= U.S. Route 17 Alternate (US 17 Alt.) was an alternate route of US 17 that existed entirely within the city limits of Savannah. The roadway that would eventually become US 17 Alt. was established between November 1946 and February 1948 as SR 25 Spur, from US 17/SR 25 on the western edge of the city to US 17/US 80/SR 25/SR 26 in the main part. Between April 1949 and August 1950, it was then indicated to have started at US 17/SR 25 (Ogeechee Road), traveled east- southeast on 52nd Street, turned left on Whatley Avenue and traveled to the northeast, curved to the north-northeast onto Montgomery Street and traveled north-northeast to its northern terminus. By the beginning of 1952, US 17 Alt. was established on the path of SR 25 Spur from US 17/SR 25 east-southeast on Mills B. Lane Boulevard, northeast on Whatley Avenue, and north-northeast on Montgomery Street, as previously. In 1953, the path of US 17 Alt. on SR 25 Spur was redesignated as the northbound lanes of US 17. =Georgia‚ÄìSouth Carolina alternate route= U.S. Route 17 Alternate (US 17 Alt.) was an alternate route of US 17 that existed in Savannah, Georgia and the southern part of South Carolina. It was concurrent with State Route 25 Alternate (SR 25 Alt.) for its entire length in Georgia. Between June 1954 and June 1955, US 17 Alt. and SR 25 Alt. were established from an intersection with the southbound lanes of US 17/SR 25 (Ogeechee Road), north-northeast on Stiles Avenue, right onto Gwinnett Street to the east-southeast, and left onto Boundary Street to the north-northeast. The highways reached the South Carolina state line, where SR 25 Alt. reached its northern terminus. US 17 Alt. crossed over the Savannah River on a toll bridge. It curved to the northwest and reached its northern terminus, another intersection with US 17. In 1985, US 17 Alt./SR 25 Alt. was rerouted to begin at an interchange with I-516/US 17/US 80/SR 21/SR 25/SR 26\\\\. It traveled east-southeast on Bay Street, turned right onto West Broad Street and traveled to the south-southwest, turned right onto York Street and traveled to the west-northwest, and turned right onto Boundary Street to continue as before. In 1991, the path of US 17 Alt./SR 25 Alt. was redesignated as SR 25 Conn. This table shows the 1985-1991 intersections. =Mount Pleasant business loop= U.S. Route 17 Business in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina ran in an overlap with Bus US 701 along part of SC 703 and all of BS-526 from 1967 to 1992. =U.S. Route 17-1= U.S. Route 17-1 (US 17-1) was an original US highway, established in 1926; in North Carolina it was overlapped completely on NC 40\\\\. It starts, in Wilmington, on 5th Street at Market Street (US 17/NC 20, where it goes north to Nixon Street, then east to McRae Street and proceeds north on Castle Haynes Road. At Wallace, it follows today's NC 11 to Kenansville, then west, via today NC 24 Bus/NC 50, to Warsaw. Continuing north, it goes through Faison, Mount Olive, and through Goldsboro on George Street. Continuing north through Wilson, via Goldsboro Street and Herring Avenue, it connects Elm City, Rocky Mount, Battleboro, Halifax, and finally Weldon, via Washington Avenue and Sycamore Avenue. Entering Virginia, it connects through Emporia before reaching Petersburg, via Sycamore Street, ending at Washington Street (US 1). In 1932, the entire route was renumbered, with most of the Wilmington-Wilson route to US 117 and all of Wilson- Petersburg route to US 301\\\\. Today, the entire route is paralleled with I-40 and I-95. =Wilmington truck route= This route used the one way pairs of Dawson and Wooster (from 16th St & 17th St to Oleander Drive. Continuing East/North it then used Oleander Drive and Military Cutoff Road before rejoining then mainline US-17 at Market Street. Mainline US-17 at the time used the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge, then split with Dawson and Wooster Streets until reaching 16th and 17th Streets. Mainline US-17 then used 16th and 17th back to Market Street. Once Mainline US-17 was moved to I-140 in 2005; the Truck route through Wilmington was deleted. =Williamston alternate route= =Windsor alternate route= =Elizabeth City alternate route= References External links * *17 *17 *17 *17 *17 Category:U.S. Route 17 17 ","title":"Special routes of U.S. Route 17"},{"id":"13606834","text":"Greater Sudbury Road 13, also known as Vermilion Lake Road, is a municipal road in the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.

History The name La Vraie-Croix () comes from a knight of the Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem who, returning from a crusade, carried with a fragment of the True Cross. He stopped in the town during this journey. He returned the next day and saw that the fragment had disappeared. The piece was subsequently found in a crow's nest on top of a hawthorn bush. The townspeople removed it, but the next day the fragment was back in the crow's nest. They saw it was a sign, and the people decided to build a chapel at the site of the tree to house the relic.

It has been classified as a National Monument since 1910. History The vaulted-ceiling of the Coimbras Chapel, with the gilded rosettes and central coat-of-arms The azulejo tile showing figures of God, Adam and EveA lion statue in limestone within the Chapel The chapel had its base in the ecclesiastical residence of the Coimbras family, and its patriarch D. Jo√£o de Coimbra, who purchased this home in 1505. The provider for the bishopric of Braga, Jo√£o constructed the chapel between 1525 and 1528, under archbishop D. Diogo de Sousa. It is likely that this chapel was annex of the primitive church of S√£o Jo√£o do Souto, as one of the lateral chapels. Artists from Biscay were contracted to complete the project while they were working in the medieval city, that included Palace of Biscainhos. These included Filipe Odarte, who was responsible for the main church,Vitor Serr√£o (2002), p.154 and sculptures by Hodart (exterior carvings) and Jo√£o de Ru√£o (retable and tomb sculptures), as well as the family coat-of- arms of D. Diogo de Sousa (in the portico). In 1530, a brotherhood was instituted support the services in the chapel. In 1906, the Palacete of the Coimbras was demolished, due to the redesign of urban space, creating the Largo S√£o Jo√£o do Souto. The Manueline elements were preserved and a new building was constructed opposite the road. The Casa dos Coimbras retained the windows and a few of the doors from the original structure, while modifying the structure of the Manueline building. It was classified by IPPAR (a forerunner of the Instituto de Gest√£o do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (IGESPAR) as a national monument on 16 June 1910. The first interventions occurred in 1936: renovations to the ancient chapel included supporting the walls and reconstruction of the ceiling. Architecture The chapel is located in an urban environment within the historic centre of Braga, alongside the Church of S√£o Jo√£o do Souto, in the civil parish of the same name. It is situated along a road, whose posterior fa√ßade faces the Palace of Coimbras, across from the Casa do Passadi√ßo, southeast from the Church of Santa Cruz and Hospital of S√£o Marcos. It consists of a rectangular tower, covered in ceiling tile, preceded by an enclosed porch supported by elegant Baroque columns with coat-of-arms of the Coimbras family. After the porch is a Romanesque-inspired rounded wooden-door, circled by carved flourishments, while the tower is highlighted by a semi-circular tower window and corbels with baldachins. The interior ceiling is covered with a ribbed vault and golden rosettes, centred on the arms of House of Lancaster. The high altar is covered in sculptures, located within niches on corbels with awnings. A rounded arch, with the arms of the founder, protect access to the main tomb. The walls are decorated in azulejo tile with figures from the creation of the world, while the pavement is covered in tomb slabs.

The kids in the photos would often exchange silly dialogue and insults, while Mrs. Munger would tell them to \\"Simmer down! Simmer! Simmer!\\" The camera would focus on whoever was speaking on one part of the yearbook page and quickly pan to follow the dialogue. Students would move between the pictures to interact with one another. The show was in black and white, but color was used on occasion (on field trips or to show cosmetics). Technical details Directed by animator Tim Maloney, and produced by Disney for the One Saturday Morning children's programming block on ABC, the skits used Corel computer software to manipulate photographs from a school yearbook. With the aid of computer animation that superimposed facial expressions, the photographs would appear to move their lips as the characters spoke dialogue, creating an effect similar to the Syncro-Vox cartoons of the 1960s. The skits ran for 18 months during the 1997-98 season, and during the fall of 1998, until a class action lawsuit was brought against Disney over the use of actual school portraits used to create the characters. Controversy Although the school portraits used in the show were manipulated, collaged, and otherwise altered, the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit felt that there was still too much resemblance. As such, the plaintiffs claimed the photographs were used for entertainment without personality rights clearance. Mrs. Munger turned out to be Mrs. Kathleen Foresman, who had taught at Woodbridge Middle School in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Woodbridge, Virginia, in 1975 when her picture and those of her 6th grade students were taken for a page in a yearbook. She, and four of her former students, filed suit against Disney on December 23, 1998.\\"Disney sued for using photos without permission,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, December 26, 1998, p A-5 Edward Jackson, a computer engineer in San Diego, had learned that his likeness was being used after his 10-year-old niece brought the similarity to his attention. Jackson, an African-American, was outraged not only at the use of his photo, but at the \\"Buckwheat\\"-like speech pattern of the character.\\"Defamation suit filed,\\" The Stars and Stripes, December 27, 1998, p13 The lawsuit was settled for undisclosed damages. Adult characters *Mrs. Munger (voiced by Peter Hastings): The teacher. She regularly urges the class to \\"simmer\\" when things get out of hand. Although often expressing frustration toward the class, she generally manages to take things in stride. Usually, each episode would end with her saying, \\"Good gravy!\\" *Susan Weiner: The field hockey coach. Appears as a substitute teacher in \\"Substitute Teacher\\" and attempts to teach fire safety in \\"Fire Drill\\". *Fern Berkowitz: A woman who teaches creative movement to the students in the episode \\"Creative Movement\\". Mrs. Munger and Fern were roommates at Chunkin College. *Mrs. Yamaguchi: An Asian-American teacher from the next room, whom Rock mischievously telecommunicates with the class in the episode \\"Class Computer\\". *Sven: A somewhat effeminate man with a European accent. He gives Mrs. Munger a makeover in \\"Make-Over\\". Students In order from top left to bottom right: *Lance (voiced by Rob Paulsen): Speaks only in Pig Latin. Apart from Cissy tattling, no one acknowledges this. *Gordon (voiced by Cree Summer): Gordon generally makes sarcastic comebacks and one- liners. He finishes his quotes with \\"ole!\\" *Karyn (voiced by C.J. Arabia): She is obsessed with death. *Artie (voiced by Brett Bauer): A New Jersey kid. Most of his statements are very simple, or even unrelated to the topic at hand. When asked to interpret an art piece, for example, he responds with \\"I'm hungry and my feet hurt\\". *Dawn (voiced by Melissa Samuels): The class kiss- up, who reveals that she is overcompensating for her parents that travel a lot. She often refers to her fellow students as \\"the children\\". Her portrait is located directly next to Mrs. Munger's. She is also implied to be Jewish during the Christmas episode. *Cissy (voiced by C.J. Arabia): The tattletale. In field trip episodes, she often wears her girl scout uniform, numbered \\"666\\". *Yvonne (voiced by Cree Summer): A black liberal feminist, in tune with modern art and high culture. Her responses usually pertain to oppression, social injustice and other common feminist complaints. *Grace (voiced by Melissa Samuels): She is the figurative punching bag of the class. She generally says \\"Cut it out!\\" *Theodore (voiced by Peter Hastings): A generally clueless student who stalls, stutters and takes forever to answer a question, even then almost always giving the wrong answer. *Rock (voiced by Rob Paulsen): The class nerd. He doesn't talk until late season 1, but only in object‚Äìsubject‚Äìverb-style (Yoda speak). Rock is friends with Lance and in the \\"Creative Movement\\" episode implies that he believes himself to be from another planet. *Amanda (voiced by C.J. Arabia): A flower child. She likes to sing or recite poetry. Most of her lines are sung. *Phoebe (voiced by Melissa Samuels): Prone to random outbursts, stares the rest of the time. She brings her mom's cosmetics to school in several Season 2 episodes. *George and George (voiced by Brett Bauer): The trouble-makers who are both named George and look alike. When people call them twins, they always say, \\"We're not twins!\\" *Mahoot (voiced by Brett Bauer): Mahoot's only usual line of dialog is a brief, throaty \\"what\\" whenever he is addressed. In 'Good Will Mahoot', he said an actual sentence, followed by \\"What\\" when a stunned Mrs. Munger asks him to repeat himself. In \\"Simmer Minute\\", the thoughts inside his head are radio interference noises. Class pets *Gerald the Gerbil is a deceased class pet. *Rupert is a turtle. On his first day in the class, some of the students annoy him, and he retaliates by biting them. One-time students *Darryl: Mahoot's cousin, who appeared only in \\"Mahoot's Cousin\\". He also says only \\"What?\\" (albeit in a low, croaky voice similar a la Mr. Bean and is apparently dumber and weirder than Mahoot. He has a crush on Phoebe. *Farquhar: A foreign exchange student from Sri Lanka. Ironically, he speaks in a blatantly stereotypical American dialect. Only seen in \\"Exchange Student\\".

She's also the singer of Brad's garage rock band. Her trademark catchphrase is \\"cha\\", which she inserts in each one of her statements. Other students include: *One student who answers every question with a clueless \\"I......\\" Possibly inspired by Mahoot in Mrs. Munger's Class. *One student who likes to talk only about video games. *One girl who's the compulsive liar of the group; she always brags about her dad, making up tall tales about his many accomplishments, never telling the same story twice.

While an undergraduate at Florida, Baughman became a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He worked at a bank in Washington, D.C. He also met his future wife, Hazel Zoerner, who also worked at a bank in Washington, DC, but returned to the University of Florida in 1941 to become associate professor of Business Law and Insurance. While in Washington, he was able to complete his MA at George Washington University.The New York Times > Obituaries > George F. Baughman, 89, First President of New College of Florida, Is Dead World War II naval service During World War II, Baughman was a naval officer and served as officer-in-charge of Navy Lend Lease Supply. He remained in the naval reserve after the war and later retired as a Rear Admiral. During this time he and Hazel had two children, Sharon Ruth, born on May 27, 1944, and some three years later, Mary Gaye. Postwar career Interior of Baughman Center Pavilion In 1946, George Baughman returned to the University of Florida where he held the position of vice president of business affairs until 1955, when he left to become business manager of New York University. He had reached the rank of vice president and treasurer of NYU when he left in 1961 to go to Sarasota to lead the Congregational Christian Church's project to create an experimental honors college of national importance. Presidency of New College of Florida As the founding president, Baughman worked with its board of trustees to create the college from scratch by raising money to buy land and buildings, create an endowment and assemble a faculty and recruit students for its targeted 1964 opening. The Charles Ringling home and estate on Sarasota Bay was bought for the campus and I. M. Pei was hired to design the additional buildings needed. Mr. Baughman oversaw the transformation of the 115-acre estate into a campus after I.M. Pei won the architectural competition over rivals like Louis I. Kahn and Eero Saarinen Associates. Mr. Baughman recruited much of the faculty so the first class could enter in 1964. He put into effect the original curriculum, characterized by a high degree of student responsibility for passing muster in faculty evaluations and based somewhat on the Oxford model. At the completion of the first academic year in May, 1965, George Baughman resigned as president, but stayed on as president of the New College Foundation for several years before returning to Gainesville. Marriage and family George Baughman was married to Hazel Zoerner for 64 years and they had two daughters: Sharon Ruth and Mary Gaye. He died December 24, 2004, in Gainesville. His memorial service was held on December 30, 2004, at the Baughman Center that he and Hazel had given to the University of Florida.

Raffles was bred by Lady Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud. Background Raffles was a son of the Crabbet foundation sire Skowronek, out of a Skowronek daughter, Rifala. Lady Wentworth deliberately chose an inbreeding cross in hopes of producing a suitable Arabian for crossing on Welsh ponies.Edwards The Arabian: War Horse to Show Horse 3rd Rev. Ed. p. 82 She partially succeeded, as Raffles only matured to be .Edwards The Arabian: War Horse to Show Horse 3rd Rev. Ed. p. 81 However, Raffles never produced any offspring in England, and it is generally thought that his handlers at Crabbet believed he was sterile.Carpenter Arabian Legends p. 140-153 He came to America as a free gift included with a group of Arabians that Roger Selby purchased from Lady Wentworth,Conn The Arabian Horse in America p. 178 Selby had previously purchased Raffles' dam, Rifala in 1928.Archer The Arabian Horse p. 16 There is an alternative theory to why Raffles was given to Selby; in January 1932, Selby told Lady Wentworth that Rifala was infertile, thus, rather than being a sterile throwaway, a gift of a perfectly fertile Raffles was a replacement.Magid \\"The Selby Importations: A Re-Evaluation\\" Arabian Horse Times May 1991 p. 38-49 However, at the time Rifala was in foal to a Saddlebred, and safely delivered the foal later in 1932. Life in the United States Upon his arrival in America, Raffles did not sire any purebred foals until 1938.Progeny list The popular explanation is that only after he was placed under a proper management regimen, did he turn out to be fertile.Edwards The Arabian: War Horse to Show Horse p. 222-223 However, there are other theories. According to Selby's trainer, Jimmie Dean, after Raffles tested sterile at Ohio State University, Dean wondered if anxiety and tension was the source of the trouble. According to Dean, Raffles had endured poor handling, was distrustful of humans, and difficult to ride. With the assistance of Dean's wife, Thelma, a skilled horsewoman in her own right, they spent many months gentling Raffles and gaining his trust. Thelma in particular spent many months simply taking him on low-stress, relaxing rides around the farm and surrounding land. After this retraining, he was put to a couple of pony mares in 1936, settled both mares, and thus, proven to be fertile, was bred to purebred mares in the 1937 breeding season. Yet another version claimed that Raffles was such an outstanding riding horse that he could not be spared for stud duties.Conn The Arabian Horse in America p. 203 And indeed, he did well in the show ring. Awards and honors Raffles earned included the 1933 three-gaited championship at Nashville, Tennessee's Nashville National horse show.Edwards The Arabian Horse: War Horse to Show Horse p. 83 A final theory is that he was discounted as a breeding stallion, was viewed merely as a potential pony sire, and only used on purebred mares after the Arabian horse expert Carl Raswan urged Selby to do so.Payne, Alice. \\"Carl Raswan Dies,\\" The Arabian Horse News, Nov-Dec 1966. Accessed online October 17, 2007 However, once put to stud, he went on to have a tremendous influence on Arabian horse breeding in the United States, siring 122 foals. In addition to horses he produced by outcrossing on Arabians of other bloodlines, breeders also had very good results by linebreeding his offspring to those of Raseyn, another Skowronek son who had also been purchased from Lady Wentworth and was imported to the USA by W.K. Kellogg. Among his better-known offspring were Indraff, Rapture, and Azraff. He broke a hind leg in 1950, when kicking his stall.\\"Arabian Foundation Horse - Raffles\\" He recovered and shortly thereafter was purchased by Alice Payne for her Asil Ranch in Chino, California, where he was stalled next to another Skowronek son, Raseyn, whom Payne had obtained from the Kellogg ranch in his old age.Mulder, Carol W. \\"Raseyn 957\\" The Crabbet Influence, September-October 1984 accessed online October 17, 2007 Raffles died on May 11, 1953.

Geography  The town is located in the Gulf Savannah in Far North Queensland on the Gulf Developmental Road, north west of the state capital, Brisbane and west of the regional centre of Cairns.  History  The town was founded by Ezra Firth, from the English county of Yorkshire, who along with his family settled in the area in 1864. The property struggled at first; relations with the indigenous inhabitants of the country were hostile and the country was not suited for wool growing. The discovery of gold in the 1880s and the subsequent gold rush allowed Firth to sell his sheep to the miners, convert his holding to cattle and become wealthy selling goods to the miners. In 1908, the railway reached Mount Surprise. Mount Surprise Post Office opened by July 1908. At the 2006 census, Mount Surprise and the surrounding area had a population of 162. In the 2011 census, Mount Surprise had a population of 306 people.

In 1941, the forces that eventually evolved into the Eighth Fleet were designated Amphibious Forces, Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, who took command in April 1942. This force, also called Task Force 34, became the U.S. component of the Operation Torch landings in November 1942.

With origins dating from the 10th century, the castle was built in the Romanesque style from the 11th to 14th centuries. Gothic transformations and trimmings were added at the end of this period. A Renaissance mansion was added in the 17th century but thereafter the castle was allowed to fall into ruins. It has, however, recently been fully restored and is open to visitors.Evy Friedrich, \\"Burgen und Schl√∂sser\\", Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg. .

The castle and its dependent buildings have a total length of .\\"Ch√¢teau fort de Vianden\\", Service des Sites et Monuments Nationaux\\". Retrieved 15 April 2011. History The castle was built on the site of an ancient Roman castellum. The basement appears to have been a Carolingian refuge. Historically, the first Count of Vianden was mentioned in 1090. The castle continued to be the seat of the Vianden's influential counts until the beginning of the 15th century. Around 1100, a square keep was built as well as a kitchen, a chapel and residential rooms indicating that an aristocratic family lived there at the time. During the first half of the 12th century, a new residential tower and a prestigious decagonal chapel were added while the palace itself was extended. At the beginning of the 13th century, a new two- storey palace measuring was built with a sumptuous gallery connecting it to the chapel. These additions show how the Counts of Vianden sought to rival the House of Luxembourg. The last great change took place in the middle of the 13th century when the entire castle was adapted to reflect the Gothic style. Finally, in 1621 the Nassau Mansion with its banqueting hall and bedroom was built by Prince Maurice of Orange-Nassau-Vianden in the Renaissance style replacing a damaged side wing of the 11th century keep.Gaby Frantzen-Heger, \\"Castle-Palace of Vianden\\", Les Amis du ch√¢teau de Vianden, Vianden, 1998. . During the 16th century, the castle was more or less abandoned by the Counts of Vianden who had gained the additional title of the House of Nassau-Orange after Elisabeth, the granddaughter of Henry II of Vianden had willed the County of Vianden together with its castle to her cousin, Count Engelbert of Nassau. This initiated the long association between Vianden and the House of Nassau. In 1564, William the Silent, Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau and of Vianden, took an initial interest in Vianden where he built the first blast furnace in Luxembourg but left in 1566 to lead the Dutch revolt against King Philip II of Spain. As a result, Philip confiscated the castle and conferred it on Peter Ernst von Mansfeld, the governor of Luxembourg.Jean Milmeister, \\"Vianden, Cit√© m√©di√©vale\\", Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg 1984. . In 1820, King William I sold the castle to Wenzel Coster, an alderman, for 3,200 florins. Coster started to demolish the building, selling off the tiles from the roof, the wooden panelling, the doors and the windows piece by piece. Soon the castle was a ruin. Restoration Ruins of Vianden Castle, drawing by Nicolas Liez (1834) Such was the indignation of his subjects at the mistreatment of the castle that in 1827 the king, himself a Count of Vianden, repurchased the ruin for 1,100 florins hoping to begin restoration work. Unfortunately, his time was taken up with the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and it was not until 1851 that Prince Henry of the Netherlands reconstructed the chapel at his own expense, giving it a lower roof. When Adolphe of Nassau- Weilbourg became Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1890, he charged Bobo Ebhardt, a German specialist, with further restoration. Although Ebhardt succeeded in making important progress, his work was interrupted by the First World War. During the Second World War, in the Battle of Vianden which took place on November 19, 1944, the castle was ably defended against the Waffen-SS by members of the Luxembourgish anti-Nazi resistance, and proved to have some military value even under conditions of modern warfare. It was not until 1962 that consideration was again given to restoration, resulting in reconstruction of the Armory. Further progress was hampered by questions of the castle's ownership. Only after Grand Duke Jean had ceded the castle to the State in 1977 did work continue. In 1978, attention turned to rebuilding the walls, the gables and the roof. In 1979, the chapel was also given a new roof and restored to reflect its original Gothic appearance, which had been lost during the fire of 1667 caused by lightning. The white tower was also reinforced and topped with a conical roof. Finally, after the Nassau Mansion was fully restored in 1981‚Äì82, efforts were made to refurnish the interior as authentically as possible. This work was completed in 1990. The castle today The castle is open to visitors throughout the year from 10 am to 4 pm every day. In March and October, the closing time is extended to 5 pm and in the summer months to 6 pm.

These people were the first enslaved Africans brought en masse to the middle Mississippi River Valley. Prior to Renault's enterprise, slavery in Missouri under French colonial rule had been practiced on a much smaller scale as compared to elsewhere in the French colonies. The institution of slavery only became especially prominent in the area following two major events: the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793, and the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. These events led to the westward migration of slave-owning settlers into the area of present-day Missouri and Arkansas, then known as Upper Louisiana. The majority of slave owners in Missouri had moved from worn-out agricultural lands in North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. Still, cotton cultivation, arguably the industry to which slave labor was the most important, was never as well-suited to Missouri's climate as to the rest of the southern United States, and was limited entirely to the most southern parts of the state near the border with present-day Arkansas. Slavery in other areas of Missouri was concentrated in other agricultural industries, such as those for tobacco, hemp, grain, and livestock. A number of slaves was also hired out as stevedores, cabin boys, or deck hands on the ferries of the Mississippi River. By the beginning of the American Civil War, only 36 counties in Missouri had 1,000 or more slaves. Male slaves fetched a price of up to $1,300. In the State Auditor's 1860 report, the total value of all slaves in Missouri was estimated at approximately US$44,181,912. Slave codes Spanish officials established slaves codes in the 1770s. Under U.S. rule, Missouri's territorial slave code was enacted in 1804, a year after the Louisiana Purchase, under which slaves were banned from the use of firearms, participation in unlawful assemblies, or selling alcoholic beverages to other slaves. It also severely punished slaves for participating in riots, insurrections, or disobedience of their masters. It also provided for punishment by mutilation of a slave who sexually assaulted a white woman; a white man who sexually assaulted a female slave of another white man was typically charged with nothing more than trespassing upon her owner's property. The code was retained by the State Constitution of 1820. At the end of 1824, the Missouri General Assembly passed a law providing a process for enslaved persons to sue for freedom and have some protections in the process. An 1825 law passed by the General Assembly declared blacks incompetent as witnesses in legal cases which involved whites, and testimonies by black witnesses were automatically invalidated. In 1847, an ordinance banning the education of blacks and mulattoes was enacted. Anyone caught teaching a black or mulatto person, whether enslaved or free, was to be fined $500 and serve six months in jail. Abolitionism Elijah Lovejoy edited an abolitionist newspaper, the Observer, in St. Louis before being driven out by a mob in 1836. He fled across the Mississippi River to Alton, Illinois, where he was later killed in an exchange of gunfire with a pro-slavery mob. In 1846, one of the nation's most public legal controversies regarding slavery began in St. Louis Circuit Court. Dred Scott, a slave from birth, sued his owner's widow on the basis of a Missouri precedent that held that slaves freed through prolonged residence in a free state or territory would remain free upon returning to Missouri. Scott had spent several years living in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory with his owner, Dr. John Emerson, before returning to Missouri in 1840. After Emerson's death, Emerson's widow refused to buy Scott's and his family's freedom, so Scott resorted to the legal action permitted him under Missouri's 1824 law. Scott eventually lost his case in the Missouri Supreme Court, but brought legal suit again in 1853 under federal law. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court and became a flashpoint in the ongoing national debate over the legality of slavery. In 1857, the Supreme Court handed down its verdict in Dred Scott v. Sandford: slaves were not citizens, and therefore Scott did not have the right to sue for his family's freedom. The landmark decision found the provisions of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 unconstitutional, and helped to fan the flames of conflict between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the United States. The Scott family was eventually granted freedom by their owners, but Scott died shortly after, in 1858. As one of the border states during the American Civil War, Missouri was exempt from President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation decreeing the freedom of slaves in all territory then held by Confederate forces. On January 11, 1865, a state convention approved an ordinance abolishing slavery in Missouri by a vote of 60-4, and later the same day, Governor Thomas C. Fletcher followed up with his own \\"Proclamation of Freedom\\". This action effectively marked the end of legal slavery in the state of Missouri.

The Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing. Police worked quickly to clear the area after the explosion fearing there could be another device nearby. The blast caused extensive damage to the hotel and neighbouring shops with broken glass spread over a wide area. Witnesses said police arrived only five minutes before the bomb went off, and it is not clear whether the hotel was warned before they turned up. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said an officer telephoned the Hilton shortly after receiving the warning, but the hotel denied this. \\"A policeman was just telling the assistant manager that he had better evacuate when the bomb went off,\\" said press officer Anne Crewdson.

Pub. Disclosure Comm'n (2007) was a Washington State Supreme Court case dealing with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the regulation of political speech. The case invalidated a Washington law that allowed for sanctions for statements made about a candidate for political office, if those statements were found by the State's Public Disclosure Commission to be false and to have been made with actual malice. The Court's decision was divided 5-4. Background The plaintiff, Marilou Rickert, was an American lawyer and politician who ran for Washington State Senate in 2002 as a Green Party candidate against incumbent senator Tim Sheldon. The case was litigated by the American Civil Liberties Union. Decision For the majority, Justice James M. Johnson wrote \\"The notion that the government, rather than the people, may be the final arbiter of truth in political debate is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.\\" Three justices, Charles W. Johnson, Richard B. Sanders, and Susan Owens, signed the opinion. Chief Justice Gerry L. Alexander wrote a separate concurring opinion, which stated that \\"the majority goes too far in concluding that any government censorship of political speech would run afoul of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\" However, because the statute in question prohibited both defamatory and non-defamatory speech, he joined the majority in invalidating the law. In the dissent, joined by justices Bobbe J. Bridge, Tom Chambers and Mary E. Fairhurst, justice Barbara A. Madsen wrote that \\"the majority's decision is an invitation to lie with impunity.\\" The dissent argued that because the law required that punishable speech be made with actual malice, as required by the invalidated law, the type of speech in question was not protected under the U.S. Constitution.

It is the only interior part of Buda Castle which survived the destruction of World War II and was not demolished during the subsequent decades of rebuilding. History The Palatinal Crypt is located under the former Castle Church, built in 1768 (and finally destroyed in 1957), in the central wing of the palace. The underground crypt was first used as a burial place between 1770 and 1777. Only ten people were buried, including five infants, all of them commoners. Later their corpses were removed. On 23 August 1820 Elisabeth Karoline, the infant daughter of Palatine Joseph was buried in the crypt. Seventeen years later, the Palatine's 13-year-old son Alexander Leopold followed. This time Palatine Joseph decided to convert the crypt into a family mausoleum. He asked for permission from the Viennese court and commissioned architect Franz H√ºppmann with the task. The work was finished in March 1838. The Palatine's first and second wives, Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia and Princess Hermine of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym, and his infant daughter, Paulina, were reburied here. The next burial was another palatinal daughter, Archduchess Hermine Amalie in 1842. Palatine Joseph himself was interred on 13 January 1847. Stone sarcophagi were erected by Palatine Stephen in 1847. The crypt was damaged during the siege of Buda by the Hungarian revolutionary armies in 1849. It was restored by Archduke Joseph Charles, the younger son of Palatine Joseph in 1852. The reconstruction was carried out according to the plans of √Ågost Pollack. The crypt was rebuilt again between 1897 and 1926 by Alajos Hauszmann according to wishes of Archduke Joseph Charles and later Archduchess Klotild, Joseph Charles' widow. After Hauszmann's death the work remained unfinished. The crypt was continuously used by the Hungarian branch of the Habsburg family. It was enriched with new works of art, frescoes, statues, and ornate stone sarcophagi, made by the best artists of the 19th century. A list of later burials: * Maria Dorothea, the third wife of the Palatine in 1855. * Archduchess Elisabeth Klementine in 1866. * Palatine Stephen in 1867. * Archduke Ladislaus Philipp in 1895. * Archduchess Gisella in 1901. * Archduchess Klotild in 1903. * Archduke Joseph Charles in 1905. * Archduke Matthew in 1905. * Archduchess Klotild in 1927, the last member of the family to be buried there. The crypt survived World War II unscathed and was not destroyed during the post-war reconstruction, though it was closed to the public. The memory of Palatine Joseph was respected even by the postwar Communist government and his statue in Pest was spared. The crypt was robbed several times during the reconstruction works, first in 1966. The most serious incident happened in 1973, when the corpses were thrown out of their sarcophagi by the robbers. Later the human remains were identified and reburied. The crypt was restored in 1985-1987. The official opening ceremony on 3 October 1987 was attended by eleven descendants of Palatine Joseph. Since then the Palatinal Crypt is part of the exhibition of the Hungarian National Gallery. Vaults Palatine Joseph, founder of the crypt, painted by Mikl√≥s Barab√°s The Palatinal Crypt consists of three interconnected vaults. The crypt itself is identical with the innermost vault (Room C). In Room B and C the side walls are clad with false marble revetment while the vaulted ceiling is decorated with frescoes depicting the starry sky and angels in the corners. There is a terrazzo floor in grey and claret hues. *Room A - A small chapel with a simple altar. The Archdiocese of Esztergom gave permission to celebrate mass in the crypt on 23 April 1838. *Room B - The middle room was left empty during Palatine Joseph's lifetime. Later two Habsburg children were buried here, Archduchess Gizella (1897-1901) and Archduke Matthew (1904-1905), grand-grandchildren of the Palatine. Gizella's sarcophagus is decorated with the charming statue of the small archduchess, made by sculptor K√°roly Senyei. The marble statue was modelled after a family photograph. Archduke Joseph Charles who rebuilt the old family crypt *Room C - The innermost vault houses 12 sarcophagi. The sarcophagus of Palatine Joseph (1776-1847) is situated in the middle of the room. It is decorated with a monumental, double life-sized marble statue, made by sculptor Gy√∂rgy Zala. The Palatine is kneeling, his right arm stretched out protectively above the Crown of Saint Stephen. There is a small tomb at the entrance of the vault, right in front of Palatine Joseph's sarcophagus, which contains the remains of Archduchess Elisabeth Clementine (1865-1866). It is decorated with the charming marble statue of the small archduchess, praying to God (made by Alajos Str√≥bl). A big double sarcophagus near the southern wall of the crypt contains the bodies of Archduke Joseph Charles (1833-1905) and his wife, Klotild (1846-1927). Their marble statues were made by Gy√∂rgy Zala and modelled after their death masks. A bronze Angel of the Peace is standing above them with outstreched wings. During the restoration works in 1978 Archduchess Klotild Maria (1884-1903) was reburied in the tomb of her parents. The tomb of Ladislaus Philip (1875-1895) is decorated with a white marble statue of the young archduke who died in a tragic hunting accident. The statue was made by Alajos Str√≥bl and it was modelled after his death mask. Two tombs near the entrance contain the remains of Archduchess Elizabeth Carolina (1820) and Paulina (1801). The obelisks are decorated with flying bronze angels and crowned with archducal crowns. The other tombs are simpler, with the remains of Palatine Stephen (1817-1867), Archduke Alexander Leopold (1827-1835), Archduchess Maria Dorothea (1797-1855), Archduchess Hermina Maria (1797-1817), Archduchess Hermina Amalie (1817-1842) and Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia (1783-1801).

The encyclopedia was written by over 250 Western and Egyptian contributing experts in the field of Coptology, history, art and theology and was edited by Aziz Suryal Atiya. It was funded by Coptic Pope Shenouda III, the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and others. The Coptic Encyclopedia is the first Encyclopedia to focus on one of the Oriental ChurchesCornelis Hulsman in Coptic Church Review, Vol. 13, no. 3, Fall 1992 and since its publication in 1991 it has been used by many scholars and students in the West. The Encyclopedia is the fruit of the Coptic emigrant community in the West and the crown of the work of Aziz Suryal Atiya, who did not live to see his work carried into print. Atiya developed the vision to publish an encyclopedia during the years he taught at the Middle East Center of the University of Utah. He formed an editorial committee and scholars from all over the world were asked to contribute. Suggestions for entries were given. The work started in 1980. Contributors included many non-Orthodox scholars, including such Muslims as Mustafa el-Fiqi and Ali el-Hillal Dessouki. The Coptic community in the West played a role in increasing Western interest in Egyptian church life. If the interest in a Coptic Encyclopedia in English had not existed and if the project of the Coptic Encyclopedia had not received support in the Coptic migrant community in North America, the idea of producing an English Coptic Encyclopedia would have never materialized. The production of this Encyclopedia is therefore strongly linked to the growth of the Coptic migrant community in the West. Coptic Orthodox Church leader Pope Shenouda III himself contributed to the entry about emigration. In no period of Coptic history have as many Copts migrated to the west as during the Papacy of Pope Shenouda. In 2009, the Claremont Graduate University (CGU) School of Religion acquired the right to develop an updated and continuously expanding and evolving web-based version of the Coptic Encyclopedia.

Biography Campton was born in Leicester, in 1924. He was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. From 1942 to 1945, he served in the RAF, and then, for another year, in the Fleet Air Arm. He worked as a clerk in the City of Leicester Department of Education until 1949 and then moved to the East Midlands Gas Board, where he worked until 1956. Campton worked with Stephen Joseph in developing theatre in the round in the United Kingdom, and played a major role in establishing theatre-in-the-rounds in both Scarborough, North Yorkshire (now in the well-known Stephen Joseph Theatre, a converted 1930s Odeon cinema) and Staffordshire in the English West Midlands. He worked as writer, actor and also regularly ran the box-office and front-of-house. Campton always credited himself with giving a young Alan Ayckbourn one of his first jobs at Scarborough with the immortal words, 'watch me my boy and one day you might become a playwright like me!' Ayckbourn later became Artistic Director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre and an internationally renowned playwright. Campton was always keen to encourage those interested in drama, even amateurs. At the age of seventy-six, he directed and appeared in one of the plays he had previously written for Stephen Joseph at Scarborough, Passport to Florence, with a group of amateurs, ACTWS, in Leicester. This may have been his final performance on stage. Evaluation In performance reviews published in the short-lived British drama magazine Encore of productions of Campton's play The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace and Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party, drama critic Irving Wardle borrowed the term \\"comedy of menace\\" from the subtitle of Campton's play, popularizing the term \\"comedies of menace\\".Susan Hollis Merritt, Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter (1990; Durham and London: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9‚Äì10, 225‚Äì28, 240, 310, and 326.

For the next twenty years, his life paralleled that of his employer, who by that time was a Grand Vizier. √Çl√Æ's duties took him various parts of the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East including Aleppo, Damascus and Egypt.Akin-Kivanc, E., Mustafa √Çli's Epic Deeds of Artists: A Critical Edition of the Earliest Ottoman Text about the Calligraphers and Painters of the Islamic World, BRILL, 2011, pp 18-19 When Prince Selim succeeded his father to the throne, Pascha and √Çl√Æ entered the Royal Court in Istanbul. He used the opportunity to enter literary society and mingle with prominent literary figures of the day. However that interlude was short-lived. √Çl√Æ was assigned military duties and spent seven years in Bosnia, after which he served various administrative roles in provincial towns as far away as Baghdad and Dalmatia. He felt that these military and administrative posts were unsuited to him, as a man of letters and a man of the pen. He regularly appealed to the Court for better assignments and desperately tried to find a way back to Istanbul, to no avail. His constant frustrations and resentment, however, stimulated an active period of literary output. Many of his best works were written during this period. During his time in Baghdad, he used the opportunity to carry out research for his grand history, later published as K√ºnh√º'l-a·∏´bƒÅr (English: The Essence of History).Akin-Kivanc, E., Mustafa √Çli's Epic Deeds of Artists: A Critical Edition of the Earliest Ottoman Text about the Calligraphers and Painters of the Islamic World, BRILL, 2011, pp 20-23 He became a major literary figure in the second half of the sixteenth century, and had a prolific output. He is most famous for his immense work of world history, entitled K√ºnh√º'l-a·∏´bƒÅr, covering the period from the creation of the world to the year 1000 of the Islamic calendar (1591/2 AD). This work remains an important primary source for 16th-century Ottoman history. He also wrote poetry as well as a work of nasihatname literature entitled Nu·π£·∏•at√º's-selƒÅ·π≠ƒ´n (Counsel for Sultans). In July, 1599 he travelled to Cairo before taking up what would be his last appointment as Governor of Jeddah. He spent five months in Egypt, where he wrote a book on the customs and traditions of Cairo. He became ill in Jeddah and died there at the age of 58. =Select list of writings= √Çl√Æ wrote some 55 works.Akin-Kivanc, E., Mustafa √Çli's Epic Deeds of Artists: A Critical Edition of the Earliest Ottoman Text about the Calligraphers and Painters of the Islamic World, BRILL, 2011, p. 27 √Çl√Æ not only composed and penned his works, he also provided some of the illustrations.

About Shifts vary with the particular airline's flight schedule, and, like ticket agents, gate agents must wear uniforms and put on a pleasant face for the public. Agents have a variety of duties depending on the size of the airline, including making boarding announcements, assigning seats, handling standby passengers, monitoring jet way doors during boarding and disembarkation, and assisting in customer service duties. Gate agents have the ability to upgrade people's seat if they have the desire to. Typically, on an oversold flight, gate agents will move someone up to first class who is courteous, patient, and well-dressed. They do not want to seat someone who is poorly dressed next to their best customers in first class. If the flight is not oversold, gate agents are not able to upgrade people's seats because the process is entirely automated and the computer decides who gets the upgrade based on elite status. Gate agents are able to see everything about each customer's flight ticket. They are able to tell how much someone paid for it, where it was bought, and when it was bought. They are also able to see how many miles someone has, when their birthday is, and even their address.

Collins .Flora of NW Europe: Tilia √ó europaea It is not closely related to the lime fruit tree, a species of citrus. Description Tilia √ó europeae foliage Tilia √ó europaea is a large deciduous tree up to tall with a trunk up to circumference. The base of the trunk often features burrs and a dense mass of brushwood.Alan Mitchell, The Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe, William Collins & Co Ltd 1974, (p.359) The leaves are intermediate between the parents, long and broad, thinly hairy below with tufts of denser hairs in the leaf vein axils. The flowers are produced in clusters of four to ten in early summer with a leafy yellow-green subtending bract; they are fragrant, and pollinated by bees. The floral formula is ‚ú∂ K5 C5 A0+5‚àû (5). The fruit is a dry nut-like drupe diameter, downy and faintly ribbed. Cultivation Common limes in the landscape, King's Somborne, UK This hybrid is very widely cultivated, being readily and inexpensively propagated by layering; as a result, it is often the commonest Tilia species in urban areas and along avenues and streets. It is not however the best species of this purpose, as it produces abundant stem sprouts, and also often hosts heavy aphid populations resulting in honeydew deposits on everything underneath the trees. Furthermore there is substantial leaf litter in autumn (fall). =Notable trees= One long-lived example was the \\"Malmvik lime\\", planted as a sapling near the Malmvik Manor in Stockholm, Sweden in 1618.

Paton spent his artistic career in London, where he is said to have been born, although no record of his birthplace or parentage is known. He is said to have grown up in poverty, and he is described as \\"self-taught\\". Some critics have discerned an influence of Samuel Scott's works, and also of Charles Brooking. Any such influence is hardly evident. According to an account by Harry Parker, in \\"The Mariner's Mirror\\", March 1912, p 85, while Paton was begging \\"on Tower Hill, he attracted the attention of Admiral Sir Charles Knowles (died 1777), who happened to be passing that way, and who, taking a fancy to the boy, offered to take him to sea\\". He was assistant to the ship‚Äôs painter on Knowles' ship, gaining knowledge in both painting and seamanship. In 1742, he started working at the Excise Office. His first exhibition was in 1758 on the premises of the London-based Society of Artists, where he continued to exhibit up to 1770. The Royal Academy hosted his works between 1762 and 1780. Paton's specialities were marine and naval paintings. He painted naval actions of wars ongoing at the time of painting such as the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763 and later The American Revolutionary War, as well as earlier events such as the battles of the War of the Quadruple Alliance which took place when he was a baby. The paintings include many dramatic effects such as battles at night, the shooting of cannons and the effect of bombardments. There are, however, also less militant themes such as ships becalmed. His \\"sublime depiction of the sky\\" was considered especially noteworthy. Prints of his works, made among others by Pierre-Charles Canot, made them widely known. The Moonlight Battle off Cape St Vincent, painted circa 1782 Among his most well-known works is the Action Between the Serapis and Bonhomme Richard, depicting the confrontation of the British Richard Pearson and the American John Paul Jones, occurring on 23 September 1779, off Flamborough Head. It ended with an American victory; nevertheless, the painting achieved success when included among the prints published within a year of the battle, while the war was still going on, by James Fittler and Daniel Lerpini√®re. The painting is at present in the museum of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.

Burnet, 286 U.S. 417 (1932), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court that established the claim of right doctrine.. Background =Facts= This case involved the North American Oil Consolidated (hereinafter North American Oil) company which operated several properties in 1916.Burnet, 286 U.S. at 420. One of the properties was a section of oil land, and the United States held the legal title to the property. The income earned from the property in 1916 was recorded in North American Oil's books as income. In 1915, the United States government filed a suit to remove North American Oil from the property, and on February 2, 1916, the court appointed a receiver to operate the property and hold the income derived from the property while litigation ensued.Burnet, 286 U.S. at 420-21. In 1917, North American Oil was paid the 1916 profits which were acquired during the receivership by order of the District Court.Burnet, 286 U.S. at 421. The government appealed, but it was not until 1920 that the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court‚Äôs decision. Finally, in 1922, a further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was dismissed by stipulation. In 1918, North American Oil filed an amended tax return including the profits from the receivership in its 1916 taxable income. The IRS filed a deficiency, claiming that the income North American Oil gained from receivership should have been taxed in 1917 when they achieved control of it. The Board of Tax Appeals found that the money was taxable to the receiver in 1916. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the profits were taxable to the company as income in 1917. North American Oil appealed on the basis that the income was taxable either in 1916 when it was earned, or 1922 when the final decision regarding the land was made, and was granted a writ of certiorari. =Issue= Whether the profits paid to North American Oil in 1917 were taxable income for that particular year. =Analysis= The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) argued that the 1916 profits should be included in the 1917 taxable year. North American Oil had not entered the profit as income in 1916 but did include it in an amended return for 1916 in 1918. North American Oil appealed the IRS‚Äô decision, and the Board of Tax Appeals held that the profits were taxable to the receiver as income in 1916 and made no finding whether the company‚Äôs accounts were kept on the cash receipts and disbursements basis or on the accrual basis. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the profits were taxable to North American Oil as income in 1917 regardless of whether the company‚Äôs returns were made on the cash or on the accrual basis.Burnet, 286 U.S. at 421-22. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit Court of Appeals.Burnet, 286 U.S. at 424. The Court analyzed the facts and arrived at three main conclusions: # The 1916 profits received by the receiver in 1916 were not income to the receiver.Burnet, 286 U.S. at 422-23. # The 1916 profits were not taxable to North American Oil as income in 1916 because it did not know, at that point, whether it would ever actually receive the money.Burnet, 286 U.S. at 423. North American Oil had no accession to wealth, or control of the income at that point.The Court would later articulate its position on what constitutes income. See (noting that income is determined by: (1) undeniable accession to wealth; (2) clearly realized; (3) over which the taxpayer has complete dominion). Through 1916, it was uncertain who was entitled to the profits.Burnet, 286 U.S. at 423. # The 1916 profits were not income in the year 1922‚Äîwhen the final judgment was entered and the litigation was finally terminated. North American Oil had a right to the 1916 profits in 1917, by order of the District Court. The Court held, ‚ÄúIf a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without restriction as to its disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.‚Äù It was in 1917 that the profits became entitled to them, and they achieved access to and control of the gains. If the 1922 decision had ruled in favor of the government, North American Oil would have been entitled to a deduction in the amount of those lost profits. Holding The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit Court of Appeals. The 1916 profits were taxable income to North American Oil in 1917 when the District Court determined that the company had a claim of right to the profits, even though litigation was ongoing at that time. Impact This case is significant for all taxpaying individuals, even in today‚Äôs world, because the court articulated a ‚Äúclaim of right‚Äù doctrine. This doctrine generally states that when a taxpayer receives income for which they have a ‚Äúclaim of right‚Äù it is then included as income in that year, when that ‚Äúclaim of right‚Äù is established. Later, if it turns out that the taxpayer must return the income, then the taxpayer will generally be entitled to take a deduction for the returned amount.

The Caribbean bioregion, as described by the World Wildlife Fund, includes the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica), the Lesser Antilles, the Lucayan archipelago (Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands), and Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura√ßao. The Lucayan archipelago lies north of the Caribbean in the Atlantic Ocean, but is part of the bioregion based on its flora and fauna. The bioregion does not include Trinidad and Tobago; these islands rest on South America's continental shelf, and have been historically part of the South American continent. Trinidad and Tobago are part of the Orinoco bioregion Dinerstein, Eric; David Olson; Douglas J. Graham; et al. (1995).

Geology and topography also vary, with larger mountainous islands of continental rock, volcanic islands, and low-lying coral and limestone islands. The bioregion includes tropical moist forests, tropical dry forests, tropical pine forests, flooded grasslands and savannas, xeric shrublands, and mangroves. The Caribbean bioregion's distinct fauna, flora and mycobiota was shaped by long periods of physical separation from the neighboring continents, allowing animals, fungi and plants to evolve in isolation. Other animals, fungi and plants arrived via long-distance oceanic dispersal or island hopping from North America and South America.Dinerstein, Eric; David Olson; Douglas J. Graham; et al. (1995).

Schweinfurth Sylvester T. Everett (November 27, 1838 ‚Äì January 13, 1922) was an American financier. Life and career Born in Liberty Township, Ohio, he worked on his father's farm until 1850. Everett moved to Cleveland in 1851 to work, first as a messenger and later as a cashier, at Cleveland's oldest banking house, Brockway, Wason, Everett & Co (co-founded by his brother, Dr. Henry Everett). Everett left Cleveland in 1858 to work at a bank in Philadelphia while helping settle the affairs of his uncle, Charles Everett. He returned to Cleveland a year later to his banking house position. In 1868, he became a member of Everett, Weddell & Co. (previously Brockway, Wason, Everett & Co.). Everett served seven terms, from 1869 to 1888, as Treasurer of the city of Cleveland. He was a prominent member of the Republican Party, being friends with President of the United States James Garfield who appointed Everett as U.S. government director of the Union Pacific Railroad. Everett played a part in Marcus Hanna being elected an Ohio delegate to the 1884 Republican National Convention and himself served as an Ohio delegate at the 1872, 1880, 1888 and 1896 Republican National Conventions. Everett's involvement with transportation led him to help finance and build some of the first U.S. electric streetcar systems in Akron, Ohio and Erie, Pennsylvania. He served as Vice-President and Treasurer of the Valley Railway, completed in 1880, which ran between Cleveland and Akron. A train depot and surrounding community on the railway were named Everett. In 1876, he became president of Second National Bank, later reorganized as the Union National Bank. Everett married his second wife Alice Wade, granddaughter of Jeptha Wade, in 1879 after the death of his first wife Mary in 1876. They commissioned Charles F. Schweinfurth to come to Cleveland from New York City to build the Romanesque style Sylvester Everett Mansion, started in 1883 and completed in 1887. In 1883, he was asked to resign as President of Union National Bank by Henry B. Payne, at the request of the bank's directors. Everett had speculated in stocks, including the Northern Pacific Railway, with his own money, which was contrary to bank rules. He retained a financial interest in Everett, Weddell & Co. until 1883. It failed in 1884, amid later allegations by Horace Weddell that Everett and his brother had misrepresented the bank's solvency.

F. Simpson, and Harold Pinter. The term was coined by drama critic Irving Wardle, who borrowed it from the subtitle of Campton's play The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace, in reviewing Pinter's and Campton's plays in Encore in 1958. (Campton's subtitle Comedy of Menace is a jocular play-on-words derived from comedy of manners‚Äîmenace being manners pronounced with somewhat of a Judeo-English accent.)See Merritt 5, 9‚Äì10, 225‚Äì28, 240, 310, and 326, citing articles by Wardle, Gussow's Conversations with Pinter, and various performance reviews by Wardle, Gussow, and others. Background Citing Wardle's original publications in Encore magazine (1958), Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in \\"Comedy of Menace\\" Wardle \\"first applies this label to Pinter's work ‚Ä¶ describ[ing] Pinter as one of 'several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the \\"non-naturalists\\" or \\"abstractionists\\" ' (28)\\" (Merritt 225). His article \\"Comedy of Menace,\\" Merritt continues, > centers on The Birthday Party because it is the only play of Pinter's that > Wardle had seen [and reviewed] at the time, yet he speculates on the basis > of \\"descriptions of [Pinter's] other plays, 'The Room' and 'The Dumb > Waiter', [that Pinter] is a writer dogged by one image‚Äîthe womb\\" (33). > Mentioning the acknowledged \\"literary influences\\" on Pinter's work‚Äî\\"Beckett, > Kafka and American gangster films\\"‚ÄîWardle argues that \\" 'The Birthday Party' > exemplifies the type of comic menace which gave rise to this article.\\" > (225)Cf. Billington 106. In \\"Comedy of Menace\\", as Merritt observes, on the basis of his experience of The Birthday Party and others' accounts of the other two plays, Wardle proposes that \\"Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet ‚Ä¶ in paper hats for a game of blind man's buff\\"; he suggests how \\"menace\\" in Pinter's plays \\"stands for something more substantial: destiny,\\" and that destiny, \\"handled in this way‚Äînot as an austere exercise in classicism, but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke‚Äîis an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction\\" (Wardle, \\"Comedy of Menace\\" 33; rpt. in The Encore Reader 91). \\"Just two years later\\" (1960), however, Wardle retracted \\"Comedy of Menace\\" in his review of The Caretaker, stating: \\"On the strength of 'The Birthday Party' and the pair of one-acters, I rashly applied the phrase 'comedy of menace' to Pinter's writing. I now take it back\\" (\\"There's Music\\" 130, as qtd. in Merritt 225‚Äì26). After Wardle's retraction of comedy of menace as he had applied it to Pinter's writing, Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about \\"the weasel under the cocktail cabinet\\"). For example, in December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about Old Times, Mel Gussow recalled that \\"After The Homecoming [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out. Landscape and Silence [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between The Homecoming and Old Times] are in a very different form. There isn't any menace at all.' \\" Later, when Gussow asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had \\"tired\\" of \\"menace\\", Pinter added: \\"when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin. I never thought of menace myself. It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago [1958]. I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights]. But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration\\" (Gussow, Conversations with Pinter 18, 24). Despite Wardle's retraction of comedy of menace (and Pinter's later qualifications), Comedy of menace and comedies of menace caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts, notices, and reviews to describe Pinter's early plays and some of his later work as well. As Merritt points out, among other examples of critics' usage of this and similar categories of Pinter's work, after Gussow's 1971 \\"conversation\\" with Pinter, \\"Though he echoes Wardle's concept, Gussow seems to avoid using comedy of menace when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatre's 1988 production of The Birthday Party. While still emphasizing Pinter's 'terrors' and the 'shiver beneath the laughter,' Gussow describes the play as 'a play of intrigue, with an underlying motif of betrayal' ‚Ä¶ [and] [Bernard F.] Dukore calls the play 'a comedy (of menace or otherwise)' ‚Ä¶ (Merritt 10). Selected examples from Pinter's plays and sketches ;The Birthday Party (1958) In discussing the first production of Pinter's first full-length play, The Birthday Party (1958), which followed his first play, The Room (1957), his authorised official biographer Michael Billington points out that Wardle \\"once excellently\\" described its setting (paraphrasing Wardle), as \\"a banal living- room [which] opens up to the horrors of modern history\\" (Billington 86). ;The Dumb Waiter (1960) In his second one-act play, The Dumb Waiter (1960), as accentuated through the 2008 film by Martin McDonagh closely resembling and markedly influenced by it, In Bruges, \\"Pinter conveys the idea of political terror through the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk and the urban thriller: Hackney Empire cross-fertilises with Hemingway's The Killers [1927]\\" (Billington 90), one of Pinter's own acknowledged early influences, along with Franz Kafka (348‚Äì49); Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, such as William Shakespeare, John Webster, and Cyril Tourneur, whose work his schoolmaster Joseph Brearley had introduced to him; Samuel Beckett (mostly his novels [43]); and black-and-white American movies of the 1940s and 1950s.See Wardle, \\"Comedy of Menace\\" 33, as qtd. in Merritt 225. \\"A near-perfect play about the testiness of a collapsing partnership and the divide-and-rule tactics of authority,\\" according to Billington, The Dumb Waiter focuses on two characters, Gus and Ben; Gus is \\"the man who questions the agreed system and who is ultimately destroyed by his quest for meaning\\"; Ben, \\"the man who blindly obeys orders and thereby places himself at risk. (If the system can arbitrarily dispose of his partner, why not of him?)\\" (92). As Pinter's The Dumb Waiter has been categorised as a \\"comedy of menace,\\" so may be McDonagh's In Bruges, as it closely resembles it; yet, despite the comedy and the sense of threat growing out of the menace, these works of Pinter and McDonagh are, in Pinter's words to Billington, also \\"doing something which can be described as political\\" (92). At the same time, [Pinter] had ‚Äì and still [in 1996 through to the time of his death in 2008] has ‚Äì an acute sense of the fragility of earthly happiness and of the terrors that haunt us even from infancy\\" (92). The \\"punning title\\" of The Dumb Waiter, Billington observes, \\"carries several layers of meaning\\": \\"It obviously refers to the antique serving-hatch that despatches [sic] ever more grotesque orders for food to these bickering gunmen\\"‚Äîthe dumbwaiter; \\"But it also applies to Gus, who, troubled by the nature of the mission [their next job as hitmen] to realise he is its chosen target; or, indeed to Ben, who, by his total obedience to a higher authority that forces him to eliminate his partner, exposes his own vulnerability\\" (89). As Gus \\"dumbly\\" awaits his fate, he may be a subservient partner who awaits orders from the \\"senior partner\\" Ben, but Ben too is subservient to The Powers That Be, a contemporary variation on Deus ex machina, manipulating both the mechanical dumbwaiter and them through its increasingly extravagant and thus comically inconvenient \\"orders\\" for increasingly exotic dishes, unnerving both of them. Billington adds: > This being Pinter, the play has a metaphorical openness. You can interpret > it as an Absurdist comedy ‚Äì a kind of Godot in Birmingham ‚Äì about two men > passing the time in a universe without meaning or purpose. You can see it as > a cry of protest against a whimsically cruel God who treats man as His > plaything ‚Äì even the twelve matches that are mysteriously pushed under the > door have been invested with religious significance [by critics]. But it > makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the > nature of partnership. Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority > and a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, talking past each other > and raking over old times. (90) The comedy in this \\"comedy of menace\\" often derives from such arguments between Gus and Ben, especially the one that occurs when \\"Ben tells Gus to go and light the kettle,\\" a \\"semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music-hall comedy\\": \\"All the great stage and film double acts ‚Äì Jewel and Warriss, Abbott and Costello ‚Äì fall into this kind of verbal worrying in which the bullying 'male' straight man issues instructions which are questioned by the more literal-minded 'female' partner\\" ‚Äî > GUS: Light what? > BEN: The kettle. > GUS: You mean the gas. > BEN: Who does? > GUS: You do. > BEN: (his eyes narrowing): What do you mean, I mean the gas? > GUS: Well, that's what you mean, don't you? The gas. > BEN: (Powerfully): If I say go and light the kettle I mean go and light the > kettle. > GUS: How can you light a kettle? > BEN: It's a figure of speech! Light the kettle. It's a figure of speech! > (Qtd. in Billington 90‚Äì91) As Billington observes further, > This kind of comic pedantry has precise echoes of the great Sid Field ‚Äì > ironically [since the city is the setting of this play] a Birmingham comic ‚Äì > who had a famous sketch in which he played a virgin of the greens being > hectored by Jerry Desmonde's golf pro who would cry, in exasperation, 'When > I say \\"Slowly Back\\" I don't mean \\"Slowly Back\\", I mean \\"Slowly Back.\\" ' At > another moment, the bullying pro would tell the hapless Sid to get behind > the ball and he would vainly protest 'But it's behind all round it'. But, > where in a music-hall sketch this kind of semantic by-play was its own > justification, in Pinter it becomes a crucial part of the power-structure. ‚Ä¶ > The pay-off comes when Gus, having dogmatically insisted that the accurate > phrase is 'put on the kettle', suddenly finds an irritated Ben adopting the > right usage. (91) \\"Everything\\" in The Dumb Waiter, Billington observes, \\"contributes towards a necessary end\\"; for, \\"the image, as Pete says in [Pinter's only novel] The Dwarfs, stands in exact correspondence and relation to the idea\\" (91). In this example, the central image and central metaphor, the dumbwaiter, while \\"despatching ever more unlikely orders,\\" serves as \\"both a visual gag and a metaphor for manipulative authority\\" (91), and therein lies its menace. When Ben instructs Gus verbally, while practicing their \\"routine\\" for killing their next victim, he leaves out the most important line, which instructs Gus to \\"take out\\" his \\"gun\\" (Pinter, The Dumb Waiter 114‚Äì15): > \\"BEN frowns and presses his forehead. > GUS. You've missed something out. > BEN. I know. What? > GUS. I haven't taken my gun out, according to you. > BEN. You take your gun out‚Äî > GUS. After I've closed the door. > BEN. After you've closed the door. > GUS. You've never missed that out before, you know that? > (Pinter, The Dumb Waiter 116) The crucial significance of the omission becomes clear only at the very end of the play, when \\"Gus enters through the door stage-right ‚Äì the one marked for the intended victim ‚Äì stripped of his gun and holster\\"; it becomes clear that he is going to be \\"Ben's target\\" (Billington 92), as Ben's \\"revolver [is] levelled at the door\\", though the play ends before Ben fires any shot (Pinter, The Dumb Waiter 121). ;The Caretaker (1960) In an entry on Pinter for the 1969 edition of The Encyclopedia of World Drama cited by Merritt, Wardle repeats and updates some of his first perspective on comedy of menace as he had applied it initially to Pinter's writing: > Early in his writing career Pinter admitted to three influences: Franz > Kafka, American gangster films, and Samuel Beckett. . . . At that time his > plays, more than those of any other plawright's , were responsible for the > newly coined term 'comedy of menace.' This phrase certainly makes sense when > applied to The Birthday Party . . . or to The Dumb Waiter. . . . But > 'menace' is hardly the word for The Caretaker, and still less for subsequent > plays in which Pinter increasingly exchanged his derelict settings and down- > and-out characters for environments of moneyed elegance (657‚Äì58). (Qtd. in > Merritt 240) Despite those more-recent caveats regarding applying the phrase that he himself initially coined for Pinter's writing to The Caretaker‚Äîonly the second of Pinter's full-length plays produced by then and the one that launched his career as a successful playwright in 1960 (Merritt 9, 226) ‚Äîand to Pinter's later plays, scenes in both acts of The Caretaker in which Mick confronts an unsuspecting Davies and scares him almost speechless (Pinter, The Caretaker 129, 146) also epitomise how comedy and menace still co-exist in Pinter's text and on Pinter's stage. The comic aspects of this play multiply, reaching a crescendo in Mick's monologue in Act Two describing his \\"deepest wishes\\" for decorating the attic room (161, 173) and falling with Davies, a tramp taken in out of the cold by his brother, suggesting that \\"if\\" he can \\"just get down to Sidcup\\" to get his \\"papers\\" and \\"sort\\" himself \\"out\\" (113‚Äì16, 164), his refrain and excuse for everything (153, 175‚Äì79), he might just be able to accomplish Mick's hyperbolic pipe dream and \\"decorate the attic room out for [Mick]\\" (164), leading Mick to accuse Davies of misrepresenting himself as \\"an experienced first-class professional interior and exterior decorator\\" (172‚Äì74), an absurd conclusion, given the tangible evidence of the down-and- out Davies before Mick (and the audience). Pinter's friend the late film and stage director David Jones, who directed the play for the Roundabout Theatre, in New York City, in 2003 (having previously directed Pinter's 1983 film of Betrayal, as well as other works by or featuring him), reminds his audience that Pinter himself said, in a widely quoted statement, that The Caretaker is only \\"funny, up to a point\\" and that \\"beyond that point\\" is why he wrote it: > There is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners. The world of The > Caretaker is a bleak one, its characters damaged and lonely. But they are > all going to survive. And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic > vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and > laughter. Funny, but not too funny. As Pinter wrote, back in 1960: \\"As far > as I am concerned The Caretaker IS funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, > it ceases to be funny, and it is because of that point that I wrote it.\\" > (Jones) \\"Beyond the point\\" of the comedy (the \\"funny\\") lies the scary territory that threatens one's very existence (Billington 92), which Wardle and others commonly have \\"labeled\\" or \\"pigeonholed\\" (depending on one's perspective) as \\"menace\\" (Merritt 9‚Äì10). ;Pinter's later plays Though \\"comedy of menace\\" is generally applied to Pinter's early work of the late 1950s through the middle of the 1960s, including The Collection (1961), The Lover (1963), Tea Party (1965, 1968), and The Homecoming (1965), even Pinter's late plays, like Ashes to Ashes (1996) and Celebration (2000), his last two full-length stage plays, exhibit his characteristic amalgam of the comic and the menacing, a sense of threat or impending doom; there is less comedy and more menace in Ashes to Ashes, in which heavy echoes of the Holocaust predominate; a more comedy than menace in Celebration, where heightened comic dialogue outweighs the frightening undercurrents of terror, the terrifying, or the terrible. ;Celebration (2000) While reviewers and other audience members describe Celebration as hilarious (\\"one of Pinter's funniest plays\\", according to Billington [404]), the nature of the relationships of two sets of diners (three couples) having dinner in an upscale restaurant (which some critics assume that Pinter modeled on The Ivy, in London's West End) ‚Äì \\"this is the best and most expensive restaurant in the whole of Europe\\" (Pinter, Celebration 364) ‚Äì remains characteristically ambiguous; Billington describes one set of couples as \\"a strangely rootless bunch with a depleted sense of family\\" (405). One set (the two couples seated at Table One) consists of brothers Lambert and Matt and their wives, Prue and Julie, who are sisters; the second set of diners (the couple seated at Table Two) consists of a banker and his young wife, Suki, who comically turns out to have had an affair with Lambert when she was 18 (Billington 104). As the \\"ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel\\" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem (\\"I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that public house of my childhood\\" [Pinter, Celebration 371]), the \\"ma√Ætress d'h√¥tel\\" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life (373‚Äì74), while the Waiter engages in \\"interjections\\" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers, other artists, and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one man's lifetime (367, 375). Lambert and Matt reveal themselves to be rather uncouth bullies (\\"Teddy boys\\", according to some London reviews)‚Äî > Lambert's mobile phone rings. > LAMBERT Who the fuck's this? > He switches it on. > LAMBERT (cont.) Yes? What? (He listens briefly.) I said no calls! It's my > fucking wedding anniversary! > He switches it off. > LAMBERT (cont.) Cunt. > (Pinter, Celebration 364)‚Äî who describe themselves as \\"consultants ‚Ä¶ Strategy consultants. ‚Ä¶ It means we don't carry guns. ‚Ä¶ We don't have to! ‚Ä¶ We're peaceful strategy consultants. ‚Ä¶ Worldwide. Keeping the peace (379). Strategy consultant could be a euphemistic catchall for warmonger, manager of terrorism, purveyor of counter-terrorism, or orderer of covert operations. As the banker Russell interprets their explanation, peaceful strategy consultants seems vaguely menacing: \\"We need more people like you. Taking responsibility. Taking charge. Keeping the peace. Enforcing the peace. Enforcing peace. We need more like you\\" (379). This speech stressing \\"force\\" (in the repetitions of Enforcing) occurs after Russell has already revealed his own ilk: > Look at me. I'm basically a totally disordered personality; some people > would describe me as a psychopath. (to Suki) Am I right? > SUKI Yes. > RUSSELL But when I'm sitting in this restaurant I suddenly find I have no > psychopathic tendencies at all. I don't feel like killing everyone in sight, > I don't feel like putting a bomb under everyone's arse. I feel something > quite different, I have a sense of equilibrium, of harmony, I love my fellow > diners. Now this is very unusual for me. Normally I feel‚Äîas I've just > said‚Äîabsoute malice and hatred towards everyone within spitting distance‚Äîbut > here I feel love. How do you explain it? > SUKI It's the ambience. (370‚Äì71) Lambert and Matt are distantly reminiscent of Gus and Ben from The Dumb Waiter; but distinctly less polite while living much higher on the hog. One imagines such characters \\"strategically\\" plotting the \\"peaceful\\" rendition of others without any qualms while sipping Perrier and simultaneously planning their next wedding-anniversary dinner celebration (perhaps with a different set of wives) on their mobiles. As the Waiter says in his apparently penultimate \\"interjection\\", in which one might detect intimations of mortality: > My grandfather introduced me to the mystery of life and I'm still in the > middle of it. I can't find the door to get out. My grandfather got out of > it. He left it behind him and he didn't look back. > He got that absolutely right. > And I'd like to make one further interjection. > He stands still. > Slow fade. > (385) ;\\"Apart From That\\" (Sketch) (2006) Pinter mocks mobile phones comically in an ostensibly-trivial wireless conversation, while still suggesting a residual bit of menace in the unsaid, developed as his last revue sketch Apart From That (2006). As Billington observes, this dramatic sketch inspired by Pinter's strong aversion to mobile phones is \\"very funny\\", but \\"as two people trade banalities over their mobile phones[,] there is a hint of something ominous and unspoken behind the clich√©d chat\\" (429), as illustrated in the following excerpt: > Two people on mobile phones. > GENE. > How are you? > LAKE. > Very well. And you? Are you well? > GENE. > I'm terribly well. How about you? > LAKE. > Really well. I'm really well. > GENE. > I'm so glad. > LAKE. > Apart from ... oh you know ... > GENE. > I know. > LAKE. > Apart from ... oh you know ... > GENE. > I do know.

Early life De Goede was born in Rotterdam, the first of his parents' seven children. His father was a carpenter with French and Dutch ancestry; his mother was a teacher of German descent. In 1939, they moved to Wijchen, a village near Nijmegen to which de Goede's father was posted by the Dutch Army. They remained there through the occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany. At the age of 14, de Goede gained a diploma in decorative arts from the Nijmegen Technical College with distinction, and a place at the Arnhem Academy of Fine Arts (Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten en Kunstnijverheid), but was two years too young to start. In the meantime, he worked as a silkscreen printer. He studied at the Academy when he reached 16, but continued to work in the evenings, taking up a job in a packaging design agency. He also studied for one year at Eindhoven School of Art. Move to Australia De Goede's mother died in 1956 after a long illness, and he joined his family in emigrating to Sydney, Australia. Leaving the Netherlands also enabled him to avoid being conscripted into the Dutch Army. He continued to work in advertising in Australia, and also studied part-time at the Julian Ashton Art School and Desiderius Orban School of Art, and then at the Canberra School of Art (now part of the Australian National University). He exhibited more than 30 times, including three solo exhibitions. Meanwhile, he worked for the Australian News and Information Bureau, and the National Capital Development Commission in Canberra. Later career in the UK De Goede developed an interest in abstract art, and moved to London in 1965, taking a flat in Holborn and an art studio at the St Katharine Docks run by Bridget Riley and Peter Sedgeley. After a property developer bought the dock, he moved to a large minimalist studio in a former Jewish school in Stepney Green, east London, alongside the studios of Michael Kenny and Bert Irvin. The space taken by de Goede was formerly occupied by sculptor Hubert Dalwood. De Goede was an early pioneer of opening his studio to the public. He joined the London Group in 1996, when he was also a finalist for the Jerwood Prize. He was a founder member of the Movement for a Socialist Future (later merged into A World to Win) in 1999. De Goede also taught at Hornsey College of Art in north London (now part of Middlesex University) from 1972, later becoming a senior lecturer. He retired in 2003, returning to work as a full-time artist. De Goede died from cancer in London in 2007. He never married. Works De Goede painted mostly abstract works, often large canvases confined to black and white lines and shapes, with visual paradoxes and illusions, but also smaller works: prints, drawings and sculptures. Describing his work, de Goede said, \\"A reflection of the world like it visually appears is not quite enough ... Abstraction should bring forth another kind of reality. I try to show what is invisible.\\"Obituary, The Guardian, 5 October 2007 (accessed 12 October 2007) He joined many exhibitions between 1967 and 2005, with solo exhibitions at the Grabowski Gallery and House Gallery, the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, the OXO Gallery in South Kensington in 1982, and the Stephen Lawrence Gallery at Greenwich University in 2005. He was also selected by the Arts Council of Great Britain as one of five Dutch artists to exhibit at the Serpentine Gallery. His last exhibition, a solo exhibition entitled \\"Tracing the Black Hole\\", was held at the Angus Broadbent Gallery in Bayswater in June 2006, accompanying the publication of a book by Mel Gooding and Corinna Lotz documenting his life.

Church of Saint Francis Xavier, Parish Office, Kansas City, Missouri. Francis Barry Byrne (19 December 1883 - 18 December 1967) was a member of the group of architects known as the Prairie School. After the demise of the Prairie School, about 1914 to 1916, Byrne continued as a successful architect by developing his own style. Biography Byrne was born and raised in Chicago. After seeing a Chicago Architectural Club exhibit in 1902, he sought employment with Frank Lloyd Wright and secured an apprentice position although he was untrained in architecture. As Wright‚Äôs son, John, relates: ‚ÄúWilliam Drummond, Francis Barry Byrne, Walter Burley Griffin, Albert McArthur (Albert Chase McArthur), Marion Mahony, Isabel Roberts and George Willis were the draftsmen. They included five men and two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn‚Äôt have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them! I know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern American architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches and recognition today!My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; page 35. After working for Wright in his Oak Park, Illinois studio between 1902 and 1907, Byrne worked briefly at other Chicago firms. He moved to Seattle in winter 1908 to 1909 to join Andrew Willatzen who had been a fellow employee at Wright's office. They formed the firm Willatzen & Byrne and, over the next several years, produced a series of residential designs in the Prairie School style. After the Willatzen & Byrne partnership dissolved in 1913, Willatzen remained in Seattle but Byrne moved to southern California where he lived briefly with Wright's sons Lloyd Wright and John Lloyd Wright. In 1914, he returned to Chicago at first to manage, then, take over the practice of Walter Burley Griffin who had moved to Australia to develop plans for its new capital city, Canberra. By 1917, Byrne was practicing under his own name. He briefly served in World War I, then returned to Chicago. Byrne's style developed independently of Wright and the Prairie School as he moved toward greater simplification of form. Annette Cremin became Byrne's wife in 1926, and they had three children: Ann, Cathleen and Patrick. As an artist, Annette influenced his work, drawing renderings of his architectural designs, and on occasion, contributing interior color patterns and decoration for his buildings and churches. During the depression when there was no demand for his services, she supported the family. During the 1920s, some of Byrne's work contained elements of Expressionism. He became successful as a designer of ecclesiastical and educational buildings for the Roman Catholic Church, for whom he later created three of his most important works: Church of Christ the King in Turners Cross, Cork, Ireland (1931), Church of St. Francis Xavier in Kansas City, Missouri (1949), and St. Benedict's Abbey in Atchison, Kansas (1951-1957). In the 1930s, Byrne moved to New York, but after 1945 returned to Chicago. Byrne partially retired about 1953, but continued to accept commissions until his death. He died in December 1967 after being struck by an automobile.Prairie Styles, Barry Bryne He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois. Annette Byrne died in 1990 aged 92.

Despite two marriages, she had no children, and was his last surviving descendant. Elizabeth was closely associated with the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. Both her husbands were dedicated supporters of Charles I. Early life Elizabeth Hall was born to Susanna Hall and Doctor John Hall. She was baptised in the Holy Trinity Church of Stratford-upon-Avon, England. She was the only grandchild William Shakespeare ever knew, because her three cousins were born after his death in 1616. First marriage Elizabeth and her first husband Thomas Nash impaled with those of his wife, Elizabeth. According to Charlotte Carmichael Stopes, Nash's coat of arms was emblazoned ‚Äúdouble quarterly of four, First, 1 and 4 argent on a chevron between three ravens' heads erased azure, a pellet between 4 cross-crosslets sable, for Nash; 2 and 3 sable a buck's head caboshed argent attired or, between his horns a cross pat√©e, and across his mouth an arrow, Bulstrode. Second, 1 and 4, for Hall, 2 and 3 Shakespeare‚Äù.[11 In 1626, Elizabeth Hall married Thomas Nash, who was a member of the Manor and Lordship of Shottery. Nash is known to have been an ardent Royalist, a supporter of Charles I and indeed a donor to the king's cause to the tune of ¬£100. In July 1643 the queen Henrietta Maria stayed with the Nashes at New Place. Thomas made his will on 25 August 1642, in which he left his house in Chapel Street and two meadows to Elizabeth. However, he left the bulk of his fortune to his cousin, Edward Nash. On 4 April 1647, Thomas died, leaving Elizabeth a widow. Second marriage On 5 June 1649, eighteen months after her husband's death, Elizabeth married John Barnard (1604‚Äì74) of Abington, near Northampton. Barnard was a widower with several children. It is not known how they met, since he did not live near Stratford, but it was most likely through Elizabeth's Royalist connections. Like Nash, he had been a strong supporter of the Royalists in the Civil War. Five weeks after the marriage, Elizabeth's mother Susanna died. As a result, Elizabeth inherited the Shakespeare family property. The couple moved to Stratford, to live in New Place. As a staunch Royalist, Barnard's social position improved dramatically after the Restoration in 1660. He was knighted on 25 September 1661,William A. Shaw, The Knights of England (London, 1906) vol. II, p. 235. thus giving his wife the title Lady Barnard. They left Stratford to move into the Barnard family home in Abington. The couple had no children.Joseph Quincy Adams, A Life of William Shakespeare, Wildside Press, 2007 (reprint from 1923), pp. 485‚Äì88. In February 1662, Judith Quiney died in Stratford-upon-Avon, making Elizabeth Barnard the last descendant of William Shakespeare. She wrote her will on 29 January 1669, which did not give much to her husband, Sir John Barnard. Elizabeth died at Abington, Northamptonshire on 17 February 1670. There is a memorial plaque in the Church of Saint Peter & Paul, Abington, where she is buried. The family home of Sir John and Lady Barnard is now a museum, Abington Park Museum, and the grounds are now a park in the town of Northampton.

The members of the Pentarchy were: * Sergio Carb√≥ y Morera (1891‚Äì1971), journalist * Porfirio Franca y √Ålvarez de la Campa (1878‚Äì1950), attorney, banker and economist * Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n (1887‚Äì1969), faculty member at the University of Havana School of Medicine * Jos√© Miguel Irisarri y Gamio (1895‚Äì1968), an attorney * Guillermo Portela y M√∂ller (1886‚Äì1958), faculty member at the University of Havana School of Law The first thing the Pentarchy did was to draft a proclamation which was written by Sergio Carb√≥ and signed by eighteen civilians and one military man, Fulgencio Batista. That proclamation was published in every Cuban newspaper the following day. Carb√≥ later promoted Batista from a sergeant to colonel without notifying the other four. Later they were ousted by the Student Directory and Ram√≥n Grau was named president. Attempts to overthrow the Pentarchy U.S. ambassador to Cuba Sumner Welles noted in a telegram to the Secretary of State that late at night on September 6, 1933, Dr. Horacio Ferrer, Secretary of War in the Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada Cabinet, called to see him. He advised the ambassador that he was in contact with sergeants in control of the Fortress La Caba√±a who advised Ferrer that they were deceived in participating in the mutiny and that they were prepared to make any reparation for their action. Ferrer's plan would be as follows, after taking some preliminary measures, Ferrer, accompanied with 80 loyal officers would proceed on September 8, 1933 to the Fortress La Caba√±a with President Cespedes and several other members of his Cabinet and that on early morning September 9, 1933, Ferrer would proclaim the support of the Fortress to the legitimate Government of President Cespedes. Ferrer would then ask the ambassador whether ‚Äúshould this action be taken, and should Cespedes Government make such request the Government of the United States would be willing to land troops from the battleships now due to arrive at Cojimar immediately to the east of Caba√±a Fortress, in order to assist the Cespedes Government in maintaining order.‚ÄùForeign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1933.

The original product was developed and established in 1911 by Northam Warren Company, based in Stamford, Connecticut. History Northam Warren created the first fingernail cuticle remover and nail polish in 1911. Cutex introduced nail tints in 1914, and a liquid nail polish for the first time in 1917. The product took a long time to catch on; in 1927, it was reported as being a fad in London. In 1928, the company introduced an acetone-based nail polish remover that was safe for home and helped lead to the mass adoption of liquid nail polish. Cutex was a major nail care brand in the twentieth century. =Ownership changes and continued production= In 1960 Northam Warren was acquired by Chesebrough Ponds company. At the time, Cutex nail polish was being sold in 109 countries. In April 1997, Carson Inc. purchased the Cutex product line for sale in the U.S. and Puerto Rico for $41 million. The following year, in December 1998, Carson sold Cutex to the Shansby Group, in order to focus on its hair care line as well as reduce debt. As part of the sale, Carson retained the nail and lip- coloring product lines. Shansby Group later entered into a joint venture with Medtech Labs to form the publicly traded company, Prestige Brands, which included Cutex. Prestige maintained ownership of Cutex until September 2010, when it sold the brand to Arch Equity Partners. In 2016, Arch Equity Partners sold the Cutex Brands portfolio company to Revlon Consumer products. Products Cutex has offered nail care and lip-coloring product lines.

The film is an Italian and American co-production shot in Rome and the Abruzzo Mountains. Peter and David Paul were nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst New Stars for this film. Plot The film is set in a heroic fantasy world. The Ragnicks, a tribe of peaceful travelling entertainers, are attacked by the evil tyrant Kadar, who takes their queen Canary hostage. Canary, however, manages to hide her magic ruby, the lucky jewel of the Ragnicks which Kadar seeks to bolster his power. Two young twins from the tribe, Kutchek and Gore, bite off two of Kadar's fingers. In retaliation, Kadar has them taken prisoner as well, but agrees to spare their lives if Canary becomes his bride. Kutchek and Gore are separated and work as slaves for several years, and grow up as amazingly strong adults. Once they have come of age, Kadar sets them up to fight each other to the death in the arena, their faces masked by metal helmets. But as they struggle, Gore knocks open Kutchek's helmet, revealing his face; after recognizing each other, and after seeing Canary as a prisoner by Kadar's side, the twins escape from Kadar's fortress. In the woods, they find their old tribemates, who have led a life of misery ever since Canary's kidnapping, and a girl named Ismena, a thief imprisoned by the Ragnicks. At first mistaken for enemies and nearly hanged, Kutchek and Gore manage to reveal their past association with the tribe. Incensed by the cruelties Kadar has imposed upon their lives, the two brothers plan to go back and seek revenge on the tyrant. Ismena leads them to a local trading post to get them some weapons, but have to leave empty-handed when the weapons dealer challenges them to a bout of arm wrestling and proves to be a bad loser. The three of them thereupon sneak their way into the palace harem, where Kutchek and Gore find Canary imprisoned. Instead of being freed, however, Canary insists that the two brothers recover the ruby, which has been secreted in an area called the Forbidden Land, where the Ragnicks first received the ruby and which is guarded by a fearsome dragon. But their presence in the palace is eventually discovered by China, Kadar's court sorceress. Intent on seizing the ruby for herself, China tortures Canary for information and departs to the Forbidden Land, but just as she find the gem, China and her entourage are met by the dragon, who devours them. Following Canary's advice, the twins and Ismena first travel to a secret tomb to recover several magical weapons to fight the dragon, and then proceed to the Forbidden Land. The dragon rises to kill them, but the brothers slay it and recover the ruby from its guts. They entrust the gem to Ismena to return it to the Ragnicks, while they prepare to carry the final fight to Kadar. But then Kadar, who has discovered China's treachery, arrives along with Canary, and knowing that her time is at an end, Canary calls upon the ruby's magic to make Kadar kill her and call Kutchek and Gore back to the Forbidden Land. The brothers encounter the tyrant and slay him once Kadar finds his box of tricks exhausted. With Canary dead, the ruby turns to stone, but Ismena refuses to give up. Suddenly, the ruby is restored, a sign for the Ragnicks to choose a new queen for their tribe by inserting the ruby into the candidates' belly button, where it shall stick to mark her as their new ruler. But none of the Ragnicks' maidens appears to be suitable, whereupon the tribe chooses Ismena to try. The ruby remains in place, and Ismena finally reveals herself as Kara, Kutchek and Gore's old tribemate who had since left the Ragnicks for a life of her own. With their spirit restored, and with the brothers' return, the Ragnicks are free to resume their life of travelling and entertainment.

He was educated at the University of St Andrews, where he was laureated M. A. on 29 July 1611.  Early career  In 1615 he was presented to the crown living of Mortlach, Banffshire. He removed in 1622 to Edinburgh, where he successively held four charges. On 18 July 1622, he was elected by the town council to the charge of the New or High Church; he was transferred on 25 November 1625 to the Trinity College Church; on 14 December he was elected by the town council to the second charge in the Old Church, or St Giles' Church, and admitted on 27 January 1626; he was promoted in the same year (after 14 August) to the first charge. John was able to achieve influence at court through his cousin, James Maxwell of Innerwick (afterwards Earl of Dirleton). In 1629, by command of Charles I, he waited on William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, to explain the views of the Scottish hierarchy in reference to a Book of Common Prayer. Archbishop Laud and King Charles were in favour of bringing the Anglican prayer-book into use throughout the three kingdoms. Maxwell reported that the Scottish bishops believed there would be less opposition to a service-book framed in Scotland, though on the English model. In 1630 Maxwell was in correspondence with Henry Leslie, then dean of Down, about the presbyterian irregularities of Robert Blair, and other Scottish clergymen who had migrated to the north of Ireland. He carried to the court an account, derived from Leslie, of Blair's alleged teaching respecting physical convulsions as requisites of religious revival. In consequence of this report, Robert Echlin, Bishop of Down and Connor, suspended Blair in 1631, and deposed him and his friends in 1632.  Bishop of Ross  Maxwell, according to Blair's sarcasm, \\"was then gaping for a bishopric\\". He was raised to the bishopric of Ross on 26 April 1633, and consecrated between 15 June and 18 July following, while Charles was in Scotland. The king granted him on, 19 March 1634, a yearly pension of 166l., adding on 20 October 1634, a grant of the priory of Beauly, Inverness-shire, and on 26 July 1636, a mortification of certain kirks and chaplaincies. He was also made a privy councillor, and in 1636 an extraordinary lord of session. It is conjectured that Maxwell took part in the compilation of the \\"canons and constitutions ecclesiastical\\", authorised by the king in 1635 and published in 1636. In conjunction with James Wedderburn, Bishop of Dunblane, he certainly had a chief hand in drawing up the new service-book for Scotland, subsequently revised by Laud, Juxon, and Wren. On its introduction by order (13 June 1637) of the Scottish privy council, Maxwell at once brought it into use in his cathedral at Fortrose. In December 1637, in consequence of the opposition to the service-book, the privy council sent the lord high treasurer (John Stewart, 1st Earl of Traquair) to London for instructions. Traquair urged that the service-book be withdrawn. Laud would have had him superseded as Lord High Treasurer by Maxwell. The service-book was in use at Fortrose till 11 March 1638, when > \\"certane scolleris cam pertlie in to the kirk and took wp thir haill seruice > bookis, and careit them doun to the Ness with ane coill of fyre, thair to > haue brynt them altogidder. Bot there fell out ane suddant schour, that > befoir thay culd wyn to the Ness the coill wes drounit out. The scolleris > seing this, thay rave thame all in blaidis, dispytfullie, and kest them in > the sea\\".SPALDING, Trubles, i. 87. Maxwell preached a short sermon without common prayer, took horse, rode south in disguise, and went straight to London to the king. In November 1638, on the eve of the meeting of the General Assembly at Glasgow, he was at Hamilton, with Walter Whiteford, Bishop of Brechin. He was one of the six prelates who signed the declinature addressed to the general assembly, and on this and other grounds was deposed and excommunicated (13 December) by the assembly, the same assembly which abolished Episcopacy in the Kingdom of Scotland. Maxwell was charged with bowing to the altar, wearing cope and rochet, using \\"the English liturgy\\" for the past two years in his house and cathedral, ordaining deacons, giving absolution, fasting on Friday, and travelling and card-playing on Sunday. His accusers described him as \\"a perfect pattern of a proud prelate\\".  Irish career  In August 1639 Maxwell and five other bishops signed a protestation against the General Assembly as unlawful, and appealing to an assembly of the clergy lawfully convened, though it did not lead to the return of Scottish bishoprics. Charles proposed to confer on Maxwell the bishopric of Elphin, but Wentworth had promised it to Henry Tilson. The day after the death (26 November 1639) of Archbishop John Spottiswood, Maxwell, in terms of the deceased primate's will, gave the manuscript of his history into the king's own hand at Whitehall. Spottiswood had made Maxwell his executor, and recommended him as his successor in the Primacy (i.e. as Archbishop of St Andrews). In 1640 Maxwell went over to Ireland, where he was made D. D. by Trinity College, Dublin, and appointed on 12 October 1640, Bishop of Killala and Achonry by royal patent, in room of Archibald Adair, deprived 18 May for favouring the covenant. According to Patrick Adair, Maxwell came \\"in a disguised habit\\" to Raphoe, co. Donegal, \\"about a fortnight before the rebellion\\" of 1641. Here, with Bishops Henry Leslie and John Leslie, he conferred with John O'Cullenan, Roman Catholic Bishop of Raphoe. On the outbreak of the rebellion he was driven by the rebels from his palace at Killala, co. Mayo. Fleeing with his wife, three children, and neighbours, the company, numbering about a hundred, was attacked at the bridge of Shruel, co. Mayo, when several were killed and the bishop stripped, wounded, and left for dead. Rescued by Barnabas O'Brien, 6th Earl of Thomond, he took refuge in the town of Galway, but the townsmen rose against the garrison, and his life was again in peril. He removed to Dublin, where he encouraged his friends by his zealous preaching. Ultimately he made his way to the king at Oxford and acted as royal chaplain. On 30 August 1645 he was appointed to the archbishopric of Tuam, in succession to Richard Boyle. He returned to Dublin, and in August 1646 signed the address of thanks by eighty Dublin divines to Ormonde, the Lord-Lieutenant, for the protection he had accorded them in the use of the prayer-book. In the meantime, Samuel Rutherford published his 1644 Lex, Rex, which argued against the bishop's conception of royal authority.  Death and family  When the news reached him at Dublin of the surrender of Charles by the Scottish army (30 January 1647), he retired to his closet and was found dead on his knees on 14 February 1647. His age was about 55. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral. He married Elizabeth Innes, by whom he had four sons, John, David, James, and Robert, and five daughters, Anne, Janet, Elizabeth, Rachel, and Bethia. Archbishop Maxwell left a great many writings of religious and political nature.

Upon graduation, he taught for a year in Mississippi, then opened a medical office in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1829. Seven years later, Kennicott moved with his wife and two sons to Northfield Township, Cook County, Illinois, an area that was almost completely undeveloped. He made a claim of several hundred acres south of Half Day between Lake Michigan and the Des Plaines River. Naming his homestead \\"The Grove\\" for the abundance of trees, Kennicott built a house on it around 1856. John A. Kennicott in the Prairie Farmer newspaper. Kennicott was the only physician in a wide circuit, at least in radius from The Grove. In the early 1840s, with his son Charles, Kennicott planted the first commercial nursery in the area. Botany increasingly became an interest for Kennicott, and he planted every kind of shrub that he could find during his travels. After co-founding the Illinois State Agricultural Society, Kennicott began to provide nurserymen with free scions from varieties grown at The Grove. Kennicott died at his home on June 4, 1863. Robert Kennicott, John's second son, would become a renowned naturalist. Too sickly to attend public school, Kennicott was educated at The Grove and spent much of his youth outside on the property. Kennicott collected plants and animals there and taught his siblings to do the same. He identified dozens of new species at the Smithsonian Institution and co-founded the Chicago Academy of Sciences in 1857. While on the Western Union Telegraph Expedition in Russian America in 1866, Kennicott died of heart failure. Kennicott descendant Bertha Redfield had the Redfield Estate built in 1929. The Tudor Revival house was designed by George Grant Elmslie. Three years later it became home to her daughter, author Louise Redfield Peattie, who was married to author Donald Culross. Donald's A Prairie Grove (1938) describes his experiences at The Grove. Grounds Kennicott Grove was originally about of heavily wooded land with several ponds. The house, first built in 1856, has seen a number of additions and renovations. A south room and a kitchen wing branch off from a large rectangular building. The south room was added some time before 1878. A porch surrounding it was added around 1920. The exterior of the house features few details. The only decoration is in the treatment of eaves and some patterns around the second floor windows; it is otherwise plain board and batten. This type of siding is unusual in Illinois and distinguishes it from nearby architecture. The design was probably influenced by the popularity in the 1850s of works by Andrew Jackson Downing and Alexander Jackson Davis. Downing was an acquaintance of John Kennicott and may have been involved in the design, although the boxiness of the main section is unusual for a typical Downing house. Kennicott house in 1975, shortly after it was donated to the Glenview Park District In 1973, a real estate group attempted to purchase a portion of The Grove's lands for a residential development project. The prompted the formation of the Save The Grove Committee, who attempted to have the site recognized by the National Park Service (NPS). Their efforts succeeded when the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 13, 1973. Zenith made a donation of land to Glenview in July 1974, including the main house. By the next February, Glenview had extended the acquisition with an additional . The Save the Grove Committee became the Grove Heritage Association in 1976, following recognition of the site by the NPS as a National Historic Landmark on January 7. With $1,000,000 in funds from the state and federal government, another were added by the fall of 1979. The last major purchase came in 1995, when another were added. The Grove Heritage Association has led efforts to maintain the property. The original house was restored in 1983 and the schoolhouse followed in 1987. New buildings were added to the campus to improve the educational value: an interpretive nature center was built in 1989 and a replica Potawatomie loghouse opened in 1997. The most recent addition was a fireproof and waterproof archives building to store family papers and artifacts. Approximately 200,000 visit The Grove each year.

Louisiana is allocated nine electors because it has seven congressional districts and two senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write- in votes must submit a list of nine electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all nine electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All nine were pledged to Bush/Cheney: # Tom Angers # Michael Bayham # David R. Carroll # Archie Corder # Floyd Gonzalez # Gerald Hebert # John H. Musser # Sal Palmisano # Ruth L.

The station airs an alternative rock format. Its studios are located in Northeast Wichita and the transmitter is located outside Colwich, Kansas. History KTHR's format history includes Easy Listening (or back then known as Beautiful Music) as KARD, which later evolved into an Adult Contemporary format. On March 3, 1981, the station's call letters changed to KKRD-FM (which would then be modified to KKRD on April 14, 1982), but maintained its Adult Contemporary format. By 1983, KKRD changed its format to Top-40 to compete with KEYN (now a Classic Hits station). Jack Oliver, the station's Program Director at the time, hired Wichita's number one morning show host, Tim Peters. Following the hiring of Peters, the station overtook KEYN in ratings, making KKRD the #1 station in Wichita, forcing KEYN out of the format in 1989. By around 2000, Rhythmic Top 40 station KDGS, \\"Power 93.9\\", dethroned KKRD by becoming the highest rated Top 40 station in Wichita. On June 15, 2004, at Midnight, KKRD dropped its format after 21 years and began stunting with a loop of reruns of the Bob & Tom Show, (at the same time, sister station KRZZ would also begin stunting by directing listeners to 107.3, and would adopt KKRD's old format on June 21 as KZCH, \\"Channel 96.3\\"). On June 17, at 10 a.m., KRZZ's classic rock format would move to 107.3 and rebrand as \\"107.3 The Road\\" with call letters KTHR adopted on June 28. \\"Big changes for two Wichita Clear Channel stations\\"- Wichita Business Journal, June 16, 2004 On October 30, 2009, KTHR rebranded as \\"The Brew.\\" \\"The Brew\\" differed from traditional classic rock stations in that it features a mix of music with a pop lean, that's appealing to both men and women. Bob & Tom, a syndicated morning show based in Indianapolis, aired weekdays from 5am - 9am and Saturdays 6am - 10am. On August 29, 2014, at 9 a.m., after Bob & Tom, KTHR began stunting with Wichita-centric songs and history clips from Wichita and area natives, which began with \\"Wichita Lineman\\" by Glen Campbell. One hour later, KTHR flipped to alternative rock, branded as \\"ALT 107.3\\".Clear Channel Brews Alternative in Wichita The first song on \\"ALT\\" was \\"Seven Nation Army\\" by The White Stripes, which mentions Wichita in its lyrics. The flip marks the first alternative station in Wichita for the first time in 8 years, when KANS flipped to Regional Mexican in 2006.

Mahendran. Based on the short story Chitrannai by Pudhumaipithan, it stars Vijayan, Ashwini and Madhu Malini. The film focuses on a sadistic man who makes life miserable for everyone in his village, including his wife and children. Uthiripookkal was released on 19 October 1979. The film was a critical and commercial success, running for 175 days in theatres. Mahendran won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Director and S. Janaki won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Playback. In 2013, CNN-News18 included the film in its list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time. Although no print of Uthiripookkal is known to survive, the film is still available on home video.  Plot  Sundaravadivelu is a rich but sadistic villager. He is also the manager of the local school, and manages it authoritatively without respecting anyone; he siphons the school's money for his own needs. Sundaravadivelu lives with his chronically ill wife Lakshmi and their two children: son Raja and daughter Bhavani. Lakshmi's father Thambusamy, a pensioner, lives in the same village with his second daughter Shenbagam. Sundaravadivelu, who has lent money to Thambusamy, keeps demanding it back and also insults him on several occasions. Shenbagam falls in love with Prakash, a new teacher in the school. Sundaravadivelu does not approve of their relationship as he wants to marry Shenbagam, citing Lakshmi's chronic illness. He puts the proposal before his father-in-law and offers to write off his debt if he agrees. However, Thambusamy does not agree and Sundaravadivelu vents his anger on his wife. Bhavani falls sick, and Lakshmi takes her to the recently-appointed village health inspector. When they meet, they realise that they had been neighbours some years back and had met when he had come to meet her father to seek her hand in marriage. By then, Lakshmi was already engaged to Sundaravadivelu, hence the health inspector left in disappointment. Recollecting this, he tries to help her. When Thambusamy, unable to tolerate the harassment of his son-in-law, plans to leave the village, the health inspector offers money to settle the loan. When Sundaravadivelu learns this, he alleges an extramarital affair between his wife and the health inspector. With the help of the village panchayat, he throws Lakshmi out of his house, keeping the children with himself. The health inspector leaves the village to avoid causing further strain in Lakshmi's life, while Lakshmi goes to her father's place. Unable to withstand separation from her children, she dies. Sundaravadivelu marries another woman and neglects his children, who keep visiting Shenbagam for food and care. Prakash meets Thambusamy and proposes to marry Shenbagam; Thambusamy readily accepts, and the marriage is fixed. Prakash tells Sundaravadivelu that the school's management has learnt about his mismanagement and has decided to take action against him. Shenbagam visits Sundaravadivelu to seek custody of his children so she can take care of them. Sundaravadivelu, who is jealous of her new status and enraged that she rejected his marriage proposal, degrades her modesty by undressing her forcibly and proudly declares that he is the first person to see her nude; he further taunts Shenbagam by saying that whenever her husband sees her, she would be reminded of this incident. Sundaravadivelu's new wife witnesses this and disowns him. The villagers too learn of this; angered, they corner Sundaravadivelu, take him to the river and ask him to choose his way of death. Sundaravadivelu, after sharing a tender moment with his children, drowns himself in the river.  Cast  * Vijayan as Sundaravadivelu * Ashwini as Lakshmi * Madhu Malini as Shenbagam * Sundar as Prakash * Sarath Babu as the health inspector * Charuhasan as Thambuswamy * Baby Anju as Bhavani * Master Raja as Raja * Charulatha as Sundaravadivelu's second wife * Samikannu as Karuppiah * Bhoopathy as Sundaravadivelu's brother * C. T. Rajakantham as Sundaravadivelu's mother * Venkatraman as the music teacher  Production  = Development = After the success of his directorial debut Mullum Malarum (1978), J. Mahendran was flooded with further directorial offers by producers. But he decided to make his next film with newcomers instead of stars. The film would be Uthiripookkal, an adaptation of the short story Chitrannai by Pudhumaipithan, which Mahendran read when he was in school and according to him it had impacted his life. While reading the short story, Mahendran was completely attracted by the plot and made many changes into the screenplay according to his own wish. Unlike the short story, the character of Sundaravadivelu was shown in the film as less sympathetic than the story version, and the child character Raja, who was killed off in the story, was changed to show him alive in the film. The title Uthiripookkal was suggested by music director Ilaiyaraaja. Ashok Kumar handled the cinematography, while B. Lenin made his debut as editor with the film. Mahendran himself produced the film under the banner \\"Dimple Creations\\" named after his daughter and he had chosen his friend Balakrishnan to handle production duties. Mahendran requested Balakrishnan to pay amount for Pudhumaipithan's family to which Balakrishnan initially hesitated as he found the screenplay of Uthiripookkal to be entirely different from Chittranai but later relented. = Casting = Mahendran cast Vijayan as Sundaravadivelu at the last minute. Debutant Ashwini from Bangalore was chosen to portray Sundaravadivelu's first wife Lakshmi, and Madhu Malini as Lakshmi's sister Shenbagam. Male supporting characters were played by Sarath Babu, Charuhasan, Kumarimuthu, Sundar and Bhoopathy, son of actress Manorama while female supporting characters were played by Charulatha, Premi and C.T. Rajakantham. = Filming = The film was launched with the song recording of \\"Azhagiya Kanne\\". It was shot primarily at Palapatti near Mettupalayam and Vellipalayam.  Themes  Uthiripookkal deals with domestic violence and sadism. According to Ram Chander of Film Companion, the character of Sundaravadivelu \\"represents the filth in the hearts of all men and the climax is a call to destroy that demon so that we can move on as a society. Seen this way, Uthiripookkal is much more than just the tale of a solitary sadist and how he meets his end.\\"  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, while the lyrics for the songs were written by Kannadasan, M. G. Vallabhan, Muthulingam and Gangai Amaran. The song \\"Naan Paada\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Kalyani.  Release and reception  Uthiripookkal was released on 19 October 1979. The Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, in a review dated 4 November 1979, rated the film 60 out of 100. It is among the magazine's highest-rated films. The Indian Express wrote on 20 October, \\"[Uthiripookkal] is a celluloid poem. It is for the Tamil people to decide whether they want meaningful films or just movies.\\" The Hindu wrote on 26 October, \\"This colour movie is bound to change the fate of [the] Tamil film industry provided the producers take the cue.\\" The film was a commercial success, running for 175 days in theatres and becoming a silver jubilee film. Mahendran won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Director, and S. Janaki won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Playback.  Legacy  The film has been critically acclaimed and is considered a landmark film in Tamil cinema. After watching the film, many people who also read the source material thronged bookstores to read it again because of the differences between the two. In a 2002 interview with The Hindu, director Mani Ratnam remarked \\"If I get anywhere near what Mahendran did in [Uthiripookkal], I‚Äôll be a happy man.\\" The Times of India wrote, \\"1979 was the year of Uthiripookkal\\". On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, CNN-IBN (later known as CNN-News18) included the film in its list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time.

She was the first female president of the American Historical Association and first the woman to have an article published in the American Historical Review. Biography Neilson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to William George Neilson (a metallurgical engineer) and Mary Louise Neilson. She attended Bryn Mawr College, from which she received an A.B. in 1893, an A.M. in 1894, and a Ph.D. in 1899. She studied under Charles McLean Andrews at Bryn Mawr, and spent a year of her Ph.D. studies in England, where she studied under Frederic Maitland and Paul Vinogradoff. Neilson would later credit Andrews with encouraging her to study history rather than English literature. She taught at Agnes Irwin School in Philadelphia from 1897 to 1900, and lectured at Bryn Mawr from 1900 to 1902. In 1902 she moved to Mount Holyoke College as an instructor in history, and in 1904 was appointed professor of European history there. She rose to the rank of full professor in 1905, and stayed in that position until retiring from teaching in 1939. Neilson graduated from Bryn Mawr ‚Äì and later worked at Holyoke ‚Äì with fellow medievalist Bertha Putnam. In 1926 she was elected a fellow of the Medieval Academy of America, the first woman so elected; and in 1943 she served as the president of the American Historical Association, the first woman to do so. She died in 1947 in South Hadley, Massachusetts. Scholarly work Neilson's first major work was her doctoral dissertation, Economic Conditions on the Manors of Ramsey Abbey, in which she investigated the economic affairs of the lands held by Ramsey Abbey in the Middle Ages. She continued to be primarily concerned with the development of rural medieval England thereafter. She edited three surveys of the lands owned by English monasteries, focusing particularly on the economic and social conditions surrounding them. In addition, she wrote some volumes for nonspecialists and some works on medieval legal systems. =Selected works= * Economic Conditions on the Manors of Ramsey Abbey (1899) * Customary Rents (1910) * Survey of the Honour of Denbigh (1914) * The Terrier of Fleet Lincolnshire (1920) * The Cartulary of Bilsington Kent (1927) * Mediaeval Agrarian Economy (1936) References  Category:1873 births Category:1947 deaths Category:American medievalists Category:Women medievalists Category:Mount Holyoke College faculty Category:Bryn Mawr College alumni Category:American women academics Category:Presidents of the American Historical Association Category:Writers from Philadelphia Category:Fellows of the Medieval Academy of America Category:Historians from Pennsylvania Category:American women historians Category:19th-century American historians Category:19th-century American women writers Category:20th-century American historians Category:20th-century American women writers ","title":"Nellie Neilson"},{"id":"13608152","text":"The Oberm√ºnster, or Oberm√ºnster Abbey, Regensburg, was a collegiate house of canonesses (Frauenstift) in Regensburg, Bavaria, second only to Niederm√ºnster in wealth and power.  History  The Oberm√ºnster (\\"higher monastery\\", named in relation to the older Niederm√ºnster, or \\"lower monastery\\"), dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, was founded in the early 9th century by the ruling house of the Carolingians as a Benedictine nunnery to complement the adjacent St. Emmeram's Abbey. It passed almost immediately into the possession of the bishops of Regensburg, at that date also abbots of St. Emmeram's, but King Louis the German recovered it by exchanging Mondsee Abbey for it in 833. His widow, Hemma, became abbess of Oberm√ºnster, although she was buried in St. Emmeram's. In the early 10th century it was a private monastery of the family of the Dukes of Bavaria. The nunnery and its church were destroyed by fire in 1002, and was rebuilt and revitalised by Emperor Henry II, who is traditionally considered its founder, and who made it an Imperial abbey ‚Äî judicially independent, but in this case without territorial sovereignty. In 1219 it was put under Papal protection and in 1315 Emperor Louis the Bavarian elevated the abbesses to the Reichsf√ºrstentum, or Imperial principality, after which they were known as Princess-abbesses (\\"F√ºrst√§btissinnen\\"). Ruin of the Collegiate Church of Oberm√ºnster in Regensburg, destroyed during an air raid Repeated attempts to reform the rule of life and to return the house to its original Benedictine practice failed and in 1484 Oberm√ºnster formally became a collegiate house for noblewomen (adlige Frauenstift), which is what it had in any case been in practice for many years. During the 17th and 18th centuries the buildings and church were refurbished in the Baroque style. It was dissolved in 1810 during the secularisation of Bavaria. The last canonesses remained there in retirement until 1822, after which it became a seminary. In 1862 the episcopal boys' seminary was also established there. In 1944 bombs destroyed the church and part of the claustral buildings. After the war the central episcopal archive, the library, part of the diocesan museum and other diocesan service functions were accommodated in the buildings that remained.

In contrast to the National Pinetum, which contains exclusively coniferous trees, the forest contains both deciduous and coniferous species. It forms part of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and is one of the so-called \\"Seven Wonders Of The Weald\\". Bedgebury Forest has facilities for cycling, mountain biking, riding, orienteering and adventure play. History Bedgebury is first mentioned in an Anglo-Saxon charter in AD 841, the name deriving from the Old English bycgan, meaning \\"buy\\", and the Kentish , meaning \\"to bend or turn\\", possibly in reference to a stream. Bedgebury Forest has always been wooded and is classed as an ancient woodland. Heather is present, which indicates that parts of the forest may have been managed as wooded heath. Streams in the Forest show evidence of dams, storing water for the Wealden iron industry and later the ornamental lakes on the Bedgebury Estate. Geography Bedgebury Forest is located between Goudhurst, Hawkhurst and Flimwell in the High Weald of Kent. It is situated on a high plateau, amongst the rolling hills of the Wealden Group. The geology is mostly clay and sandstone, and the soil is poor and acidic, which is the reason for the woodland's persistence: better, more accessible land was cleared for agriculture long ago. Bedgebury Forest falls within the catchment areas of the rivers Medway and Rother. Activities Bedgebury Forest is open to the public and provides facilities for cycling, mountain biking, riding, orienteering and adventure play. The network of paths and tracks that run through the forest provide opportunities for walking and running. One of the tracks that runs through the forest. =Cycling= There are of surfaced cycle track and of single-track mountain-bike routes, and a \\"free-ride\\" area has been set up that allows riders to perform jumps and stunts. The Visitor Centre provides cycles for hire. In 2006 Bedgebury Forest Cycling Club was set up. =Running and orienteering= Bedgebury Forest has four orienteering routes of varying difficulty levels, designed by a British Orienteering Federation-affiliated group. The shortest is , the longest is , with maps provided by the Visitor Centre. Bedgebury Forest also hosts an annual 10 km charity run. =Horseback Riding= There are dedicated way- marked horse-riding trails across the forest that link to existing bridlepaths, creating a network of horse-friendly routes. Riders must be in possession of a TROT permit. =Adventure play= Bedgebury Forest has a specially designed adventure play area incorporating trails, swings, climbing walls and other child play facilities. A Go Ape adventure course was installed in spring 2007. =Music= The Forestry Commission uses part of the land as a concert venue.

Archaeological investigations into these lands have identified more than fifteen sites of interest. The tribe considers the entire reservation to be archaeologically sensitive, requiring investigation before any significant construction projects take place on its territory. Materials found at sites investigated on the reservation include aboriginal lithic and quartz stonework, and a variety of colonial trade items believed to date as far back as the 16th century. While the earliest village sites found provide little evidence about housing, by the 18th century the Pequots were documented as living in both traditional wigwam-style structures, as well as European-style wood frame houses.

Nevertheless, the Navy wisely remained in the upper James, where its support a month later saved the Army of the Potomac from destruction at the end of Lee's masterful Seven Days campaign. Meanwhile, Jacob Bell labored tirelessly in support of the Union cause, engaging batteries and pickets ashore, reconnoitering tributaries in hostile territory, and maintaining communications along the river.

Langston worked on a number of different reptiles and amphibians in his long career, beginning with the 1950 description (with J. Willis Stovall) of the theropod dinosaur Acrocanthosaurus. Langston was hired by the National Museum of Canada in 1954 to replace Charles M. Sternberg, and worked in western Canada and on Prince Edward Island until 1962. One of his major finds, with Loris Russell, was the rediscovery of Sternberg's Scabby Butte Pachyrhinosaurus bonebed. Langston, along with a small team of fieldworkers, excavated the Scabby Butte bonebed in 1957, securing several skulls and several hundred bones there. He then went on in 1963 to the University of Texas, where in 1969 he became the second director of the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory, where he worked on many projects, including work on Cretaceous vertebrates from Big Bend National Park. Finds that he and his students worked on include the giant pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus and a variety of Permian and Mesozoic reptiles. He retired in 1986, but continued to be active in the field. In 2007, Langston was the twentieth recipient of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's A. S. Romer-G. G. Simpson Medal, the highest honor of the society. Langston died of natural causes a few days after a Geological Society of America symposium held in his honor at the South Central Geological Society of America meeting in Austin, Texas. Animals named by Langston include the carcharodontosaurid theropod Acrocanthosaurus (1950), the hadrosauroid dinosaur Lophorhothon (1960), and the microsaur Carrolla (1986). The mesoeucrocodylians Langstonia, Akanthosuchus langstoni and Albertochampsa langstoni; theropod Saurornitholestes langstoni; and pachycephalosaur Texacephale langstoni were named for him.

The album was recorded with producer Roger Lomas, who plays bass on some songs, and frequently seeks a more slow, eclectic sound, with new wave influences. Band members Charley Anderson and Desmond Brown, uncomfortable with the new approach, left the band during production and after the release of 1980 single \\"The Whisper\\" to form the band The People. They were replaced by keyboard player, James Mackie,Interviews with James Mackie, February 2006; November 2008 and bass player, Adam Williams. Ian Dury and the Blockheads bassist Norman Watt-Roy played bass on the title track and \\"Washed Up and Left for Dead\\". The album's lyrical content is frequently bleak, taking inspiration from early 1980s racial and social conflicts, economic problems and war. Upon release, the album was a critical and commercial failure. The release of the title track as a single unintentionally coincided with the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, and \\"at such a time it would have been a brave radio producer who would have earmarked a track titled 'Celebrate the Bullet' for a prime time slot.\\" As a result, the single and album flopped and the band subsequently split up. Nonetheless, the album has more recently been reappraised, and is considered by lead singer Pauline Black to be among the band's best work. Captain Oi Records remastered the album in 2001. Background and recording The Selecter's debut album Too Much Pressure (1980), with its blend of ska, reggae and punk and socio conscious lyrics, was a critical and commercial success; however, the aftermath of its release was fraught with problems for the band. Their relationship with 2 Tone Records was diminishing, who were releasing merchandise without band consent, and also felt \\"there were not enough avenues for them to broaden their musical horizons again this was due to the huge success of 2 Tone.\\" During these events, the group \\"admitted that they were less than happy\\" with Too Much Pressure, which they felt was the product of what their singer Pauline Black recalled was \\"a life-span, which was telescoped down into a very short space of time\\". The band left the label and signed a direct deal with its parent label Chrysalis to record their second album, Celebrate the Bullet. They recorded a non-album single, \\"The Whisper\\", which was a Top 40 hit. In August 1980, the band convened at Coventry's Horizon Studios, the same place they recorded their debut album, to begin \\"laying down possible new tracks\\" for the album, \\"guaranteed to bring on a fresh bout of arguments.\\" Most of the band had taken influence from new wave and wanted to incorporate the sound into their new album. However, a minority of the band were put off, and the arguments in the band about the album material were tense, with Black recalling: \\"I think the main protagonists were [bassist Charley Anderson] and [keyboardist Desmond Brown]\\". On 21 August, Brown inexplicably left the band, saying he \\"done with the band.\\" Anderson soon also asked to leave the band. He had refused to play on the album and later stating he \\"didn‚Äôt think it was the right direction for the band.\\" Brown and Anderson soon formed short-lived 2 Tone band The People with Silverton Hutchinson, original drummer for the Specials. Norman Watt-Roy (pictured in 2014) played bass on two tracks during the band's personnel change. Shortly after, when The Selecter played non-album single \\"The Whisper\\" on Top of the Pops on the same day that Ian Dury and the Blockheads performed \\"I Wanna Be Straight\\", Dury observed the band were short of band members, and in a studio lift following the show's recording, proposed to the Selecter that his bassist Norman Watt-Roy play bass on a few of their tracks until the band found official replacements for Brown and Anderson. Black called Watt-Roy \\"the quintessential new wave bassist.\\" Watt-Roy ultimately played bass on the title track and \\"Washed Up and Left for Dead\\", two brooding songs written by band lyricist and founder Noel Davies which \\"both needed a definitive bass line, the kind of melodic line that was a 'hook' in itself.\\" Black recalled \\"it was obvious that he understood the sparing subtlety required to match the evocative vocal lines and poignant guitar melodies.\\" Celebrate the Bullet was recorded with producer Roger Lomas, who had produced the band's debut single \\"On My Radio\\"; Black had regretted the fact he did not produce Too Much Pressure as a result of the band's democratic decision against it, but the new line-up allowed him to return. Lomas played bass on the other songs that Watt- Roy did not perform on until Adam Williams joined the band as bassist and official replacement for Anderson, \\"and as luck would have it Williams knew a keyboard player, James Mackie who could also play saxophone, which was ideal for the musical direction which, The Selecter were about to take.\\" Barry Jones, who had played trombone for the band beforehand, also rejoined the band. Music Celebrate the Bullet is a dark and tense album, featuring a \\"less lively sound\\" than previous releases, and is strongly political, with lyrics focusing on social and racial relations, \\"cold war paranoia and fear for the future.\\" In the words of Martin C. Strong, the album was a \\"more lugubrious state-of-the-nation musing\\" than Too Much Pressure. In the Rough Guide to Rock, Peter Buckley said, \\"with a title like Celebrate the Bullet, we knew we were in for a serious sit-down talking-to. Sure, it was still pop music, it was still Britska (a term that, thankfully, was never widely used), it was still Pauline and the lads dancing around with lots of brass and a beat you could lean against, but it wasn't happy, not at all.\\" One interviewer, whilst interviewing Black, described it as \\"a dark, haunting, bluesy iteration of ska that to my knowledge has never been attempted before or since.\\" He said that \\"at times the songs have a new wave feel via synthesized keyboard melodies that buzz over Neol Davies' blistering, bluesy and soulful guitar solos and riffs. Other times its almost undefinable as the songs are driven by a seamless melting pot of rock, reggae and new wave via memorable melodies that stick in your head.\\" A British scene in 1980. The United Kingdom's early 1980s social and economic problems are an influence on the songwriting. \\"Bristol & Miami\\" concerns the racial riots that had occurred in spring 1980 in Bristol (the 1980 St. Pauls riot) and Miami (the 1980 Miami riots), and is said to slightly predate fellow 2 Tone band the Specials' \\"Ghost Town\\", a documentation of UK riots released later on in 1981. The energetic song features \\"punky ska rhythms\\", which are \\"typical of the 2 Tone sound\\". According to one journalist, \\"the song can‚Äôt be read as encouraging rioting, but there is an eerie embattled exuberance to it, which complements the tension in the lyrics The strangely uplifting ending reflects this contradiction of styles and thoughts.\\" \\"Red Reflections\\" is a \\"joyous\\" song. The title song has a \\"staunch anti-violence, anti war-theme.\\" \\"Deep Water\\" has been interpreted as \\"the inner monologue of a person here in the U.S. contemplating the loss of their home in the sub-prime mortgage crisis.\\" Black, who sees the song as working \\"on many different levels,\\" was named after a town that Black saw a highway sign for whilst riding on the band's tour bus during their first American tour. She explained \\"The name just struck a chord with how I was feeling at the time. That tour was fraught with internal problems among us and I was deeply unhappy for most of the time, so I began to pen a song to reflect those inner feelings. I finished writing the song just around the time that keyboardist Desmond Brown finally walked out of the band for some unknown reason, just prior to the sacking of Charley Anderson. Believe me, it really did feel as though we were in ‚Äòdeepwater‚Äô back then.\\" \\"Selling Out Your Future\\", written by lead guitarist Compton Amanor, is a \\"sad, lifting, reggae paean to recessionary Britain.\\" Packaging and visuals For Celebrate the Bullet, the band \\"embarked on a new way of styling [themselves].\\" Davies wife, Jane, designed the album cover and the new band logo, used on the LP's labels, which \\"looks like a red, white and black 'pie chart' and is affectionately known as the 'pie of cheese' in some circles.\\" In her autobiography, Black regretted Jane's stylings, as she felt the band needed more potent, striking artwork when their career was in as much damage as it was at the time. She explained: Jane's \\"absurd\\" band stylings accompanied a new look for band members, an image change which \\"wasn't going to help either;\\" Black forgone her \\"trademark trigly hat and Fred Perry's in favour of a frizzy Afro and jump suit.\\" \\"It was decided that I should rid myself of my hat and let my hair show,\\" Black recalled, \\"essentially, it was considered a good idea to feminise myself so that we could appeal to a wider cross-section of people. In retrospect this was a terrible mistake and I should have had the foresight and sense to resist, but at times I am the kind of person who says 'anything for a quiet life' and, to be honest, I was by now totally at sea.\\" Other members of the band also changed their clothing and visual appearance; in Black's words, Davies \\"grew pointed sideburns as though he was Daryl Hall's clone\\" and Gaps \\"looked like a maracas-playing escapee from a soca band.\\" The original British LP cover \\"shows a TV with a red screen, over which the words ‚ÄòCelebrate the bullet‚Äô have been printed,\\" whilst the back cover features an image of the band on the television instead. The American edition, however, swaps the front and back cover images, and the album cover also sometimes varied in European countries, often featuring the band's logo superimposed over the image of the television. Original copies of the album featured a black belly band on the sleeve. Release and promotion On 6 February 1981, Chrysalis released \\"Celebrate the Bullet\\" as the album's lead single. However, its release date was \\"unfortunate timing\\" due to the murder of John Lennon two months earlier. The United Kingdom's leading radio station at the time, BBC Radio 1, banned the track as their DJ Mike Read, taking the song name literally, believed the band \\"were trying to say something clever about [Lennon's murder], which of course couldn't have been further from the truth.\\" As a result of the ban, the song was a commercial failure, failing to chart on the UK Singles Chart. Chrysalis hurried to release Celebrate the Bullet, releasing it on 27 February 1981, ahead of its original intended release date, \\"hoping that when the single was seen in context with the overall sentiments of the album, it would be looked at anew and interest would be stimulated again.\\" However, the \\"salvage attempt\\" was \\"blown out of the water\\" with the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan a month later. No further singles wet released from the album, and it only reached number 41 on the UK Albums Chart and staying on the chart for only four weeks, a huge decline from the top 5 peak achieved by Too Much Pressure. HMV had reduced the price of the album to ¬£3.99 as part of their winter sale in 1981, and specifically published an advertisement in the NME concerning the album's discount price, in hope of clearing unsold copies. The declining commercial fortunes for the band and crumbling relationships inside the band ultimately led to them splitting up shortly after its release. On 18 June 2001, Captain Mod Records' sub-label Captain Oi re-issued Celebrate the Bullet on CD, marking the album's first edition on the format, with the inclusion of four bonus tracks, including \\"The Whisper\\" and its b-side, a version of The Ethiopians \\"Train To Skaville\\", as well as liner notes by George Marshall and pictures of rare overseas singles' sleeves.Captain Oi Records (MODSKA CD 018) Reception and legacy Upon release, Celebrate the Bullet was received indifferently by music critics. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau rated the album \\"B‚Äì\\" and said \\"with Pauline Black fallen under the influence of Lene Lovich and the groove wavering along with her, it's up to the songwriting. Which features more dreams, water, reflections, stormy weather, and \\"jagged imagery\\" than is healthy for bomb scare victims or ska bands.\\" Several retrospective reviews are similarly muted in their praise; Chris Woodstra of Allmusic rated the album two stars out of five, saying it \\"failed to live up to the promise of the band's debut,\\" and although commenting that \\"it has its moments,\\" \\"those can all be found on the collection, Selected Selecter Selections.\\" Trouser Press said the record contained \\"little of the first LP's brilliance; although the performances don't lack anything tangible, the songwriting is vastly less inspired and none of the anti-trendy cleverness so vital to the previous album's uniqueness can be discerned.\\" Nonetheless, the album has in more recent times has seen more praise than distaste. In an interview with Pauline Black, one journalist said it was \\"his favourite album of the entire 2-Tone era.\\" On 19 August 2012, The F Word chose \\"Bristol & Miami\\" as their \\"Song of the Day\\". Slicing Up Eyeballs included the album on their ballot for the best albums of 1981. George Marshall also wrote favourably of the album.2001 liner notes. Other artists have also taken to the album; electronic act Orbital included \\"Celebrate the Bullet\\" on their Back to Mine compilation of 'after hours' songs that have influenced them throughout the years. One member of the duo said he bought the song when it was released and noted it \\"still sends shivers down my spine.\\" Sean Diamond of Louder Than War was favourable towards the record in 2013, describing it as \\"a tense recording dripping with cold war paranoia and fear for the future which still sounds alarmingly prescient today.\\" Black considers Celebrate the Bullet to be one of the band's best albums, and to be superior to its predecessor. Speaking to Exclusive Magazine in 2016, she said: \\"Celebrate the Bullet was in my opinion, musically a much better album than Too Much Pressure, but unfortunately the release coincided with the gun murder of John Lennon and the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. UK Radio did not want to play the title single and without radio-play, no record gets a particularly fair hearing. Given the fullness of time, I think that many present day Selecter fans see that piece of work as a much fuller representation of The Selecter than Too Much Pressure. \\"Celebrate the Bullet\\" remains a highlight for me in the Selecter canon. I can‚Äôt think of a better song that has been written about the futility of gun violence than that.\\" In her book Black by Design: A 2-Tone Memoir, Black said  Track listing  All tracks composed by Neol Davies except where noted. = Side one = # \\"(Who Likes) Facing Situations\\" [3.32] # \\"Deep Water\\" (Pauline Black) [4.09] # \\"Red Reflections\\" (Pauline Black) [3.38] # \\"Tell Me What's Wrong\\" (Arthur \\"Gaps\\" Hendrickson) [3.30] # \\"Bombscare\\" (Compton Amanor) [3.05] # \\"Washed Up and Left for Dead\\" [3.57] = Side two = # \\"Celebrate the Bullet\\" [4.34] # \\"Selling Out Your Future\\" (Compton Amanor) [3.59] # \\"Cool Blue Lady\\" [3.30] # \\"Their Dream Goes On\\" [3.42] # \\"Bristol and Miami\\" (Pauline Black) [4.58] = Bonus tracks on CD release = # \\"The Whisper\\" [3.01] # \\"Train to Skaville\\" (Leonard Dillon) # \\"Last Tango in Dub\\" (Selecter) - dub version of \\"Washed Up and Left for Dead\\" # \\"Train to Skaville\\" (12\\" Version) (Dillon)  References  Category:1981 albums Category:The Selecter albums Category:Chrysalis Records albums ","title":"Celebrate the Bullet"},{"id":"13608502","text":"is a Japanese actress and voice actress.

The NRHS sponsors the popular RailCamp summer orientation program in partnership with Amtrak and the National Park Service, offering high school youth hands-on experience in the railroad industry. National organization =History= The NRHS was formed in Baltimore, Maryland on August 18, 1935, when railfans from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Trenton, New Jersey, and New York City gathered there for a farewell excursion on the then soon-to-be-abandoned Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway. Officers from railfan clubs in those cities decided to merge and form a national organization, which they dubbed the \\"National Railway Historical Society\\".About the National Railway Historical Society Leon Franks of the Lancaster club was elected the first chairman of the NRHS and William P. Hamilton III of Trenton was the first NRHS president. =Currently= The NRHS has around 10,000 members as of October 2015 and is one of the largest rail historical societies in the U.S. The NRHS is a non-profit section 501(c)(3) organization. Al Weber of St Louis, Missouri, is currently national president . Its mailing address is: c/o John K Fiorilla, Esq., Capehart & Scatchard PA, P.O Box 5016, Mt.Laurel, NJ 08054.

The program offers firsthand experience of rail history and operations, offered in partnership with the National Park Service and Amtrak and other organizations and companies in the rail industry. In 2008, participants toured Steamtown's roundhouse and shops, operating some of the shop machinery. The youth also visited Amtrak's massive Wilmington, Delaware, maintenance facility, where they went inside locomotives and met with Amtrak employees to learn about railroad careers. One participant wrote afterwards in Trains magazine that, \\"The experience truly increased my respect for the men and women who ... care for these huge machines.\\" Local chapters The Dover Harbor of Washington DC chapter, on display in New York Typically, local NRHS chapters concentrate on railroad history in their specific geographic area. For example, Mid-Atlantic Region chapters are particularly interested in such lines as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Western Maryland Railway, and the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad, all of which once operated in the region. In addition to the study and preservation of railroad artifacts, NRHS chapter activities may include periodic excursions using historic railroad equipment, such as steam locomotives. Some chapters are involved in restoration of rail equipment and structures . Others operate rail museums or own locomotives, such as the Central New York Chapter's two former Pennsylvania Railroad EMD E8 diesel locomotives. A few chapters even own and operate entire short-line railroads, such as the New Hope Valley Railway.

Early life and education Harb was born into a Maronite family in Tannourine, Lebanon on 3 August 1944. He holds a law degree. Career Harb in a press conference, 1988. A lawyer by profession, Harb first held political office when elected in 1972 as the Maronite deputy for Batroun, in the North Governorate of Lebanon, being appointed public transport minister for labour and minister of the national education and art schools in 1979 in Salim Hoss's government, and remaining minister until 1980. From 1990 to 1992 Harb returned to the education ministry in the cabinet of then Prime Minister Omar Karame. Harb was credited with helping negotiate the Taef Agreement, which brought the Lebanese civil war to an end by electing a power sharing agreement within the Lebanese Parliament, giving Christians and Muslims equal representation in Parliament by assigning seats to sects. He was a member of the opposition during the governments of Rafik Hariri; in particular to Nassib Lahoud, Salim Hoss, Omar Karami, Mohammad Youssef Baydoun and Hussein Husseini. He announced his candidacy for the Lebanese Presidency during the 1998 elections but withdrew his nomination the day the polls began. √âmile Lahoud was unanimously elected. After a short period of support for the government of Salim Hoss in 1998, he rejoined the opposition. In 2000, he broke his alliance with Nayla Moawad and Omar Karami, and allied himself at the election booth with Soleiman Franjieh Jr, and the Tripoli Bloc of Mohammad Safadi and Najib Mikati. In the general elections held in 2000, Harb won the seat of Batroun, the second district of north Lebanon. In 2001, as one of the founding members of the Qornet Shehwan Gathering, he strongly expressed his opposition to the policies of the Hariri government and to Syrian hegemony. In 2004, Harb participated, with Nayla Moawad, Omar Karami, Salim Hoss, Hussein Husseini and Albert Mansour, in the creation of a National Face for Reform. In 2004, he declared himself a nominee for the Presidency of Lebanon, however due to a Syrian- engineered constitutional amendment extending the term of President √âmile Lahoud, he was unable to run. He then broke his alliance with Omar Karami who he considered to be too pro-Syrian. In 2005, after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Harb joined the massive protests and demonstrations against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon and demanded that Syrian troops withdraw immediately. Like many other, he accused the Syrian government of ordering the death of Rafiq Hariri. As a member of the 14 March Alliance, he was one of the several candidates to run for the Lebanese Presidency in 2008, but all major parties decided to elect a compromise candidate, Michel Sleiman. Harb is the lawyer of the Tueni family, and filed a lawsuit against two Syrian officers due to their alleged roles in Gebran Tueni's assassination in December 2005. Boutrs Harb is the elected head of the Board Of Directors of the American University of Science and Technology. Hezbollah controversies In 2007, Harb called for the integration of Hezbollah's military arm into the Lebanese Army. Wikileaks cables indicated that he had told the U.S.' diplomats in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War that an Israeli operation to control Hezbollah's strongholds of Maroun al-Ras and Bint Jbeil could enable a U.S.-brokered ceasefire and that Syria will not be a part of the solution to the crisis. He also said that Hassan Nasrallah cannot be allowed to appear as a hero to the region, despite his rising popularity as a result of a wave of sympathy.  Assassination attempt  Following an attempt to assassinate fellow March 14 movement member and head of Lebanese Forces Samir Geagea, in early July 2012 Harb escaped an assassinate attempt, which a government official said was \\"part of a series of assassination attempts\\" against Lebanese politicians. Harb commented that he had been warned by Lebanese security forces that they had found \\"bomb detonators in a lift\\" at his Beirut office.

The station was purchased by legendary TM alum Jim Long and country music artist Charley Pride in 1980 as Long-Pride Broadcasting, throughout the years KEYN has incredible monikers during their run as a Top 40/CHR music station like \\"FM 104 KEYN\\", \\"MusicRadio 104 KEYN\\", and \\"Power 104 KEYN\\". Long-Pride Broadcasting sold KEYN and its sister station KQAM 1410 in 1987 to Aberdeen Communications. On August 30, 1989, at Noon, after almost 22 years of playing the hits, KEYN flipped to oldies while retaining the KEYN call letters. The final song as \\"Power 104\\" was \\"The End of the Innocence\\" by Don Henley, while the first song under the new format was \\"Ticket to Ride\\" by The Beatles. Aberdeen allowed their company to go to receivership in 1991. Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, KEYN's format gradually evolved to Classic Hits. It previously used the slogan \\"Wichita's Fun Oldies\\" and \\"The Greatest Hits of All Time\\", but nowadays, their current slogan is \\"Classic Hits 103.7 KEYN\\". In the 1970s, their studios were located at 2829 N. Salina, Wichita, Ks. Later date studio located in the west end of the Central Heights Shopping Center at Central Ave. and Ridge Rd. Behind the Mr. D's IGA. During that time, the station's identification jingle was \\"The Rock of Wichita,\\" and featured a graphic depicting the faces of Mt. Rushmore, wearing stereo headphones. The station moved in early 2015 to the Ruffin Building at 9111 East Douglas, formerly the Pizza Hut headquarters.

The basket is typically made of sala, a swamp weed, sun-dried and blanched with sulfur. The basket provides protection during transportation and handling, and also a flat base for the container. Thus the glass bottle can have a round bottom, which is much simpler to make by glass blowing. Fiaschi can be efficiently packed for transport, with the necks of inverted bottles safely tucked into the spaces between the baskets of upright ones.  History  Boccaccio mentions the fiasco in the Decameron (around 1350), as a receptacle for red wine and administrative documents of the time mention the profession of fiascaio (\\"fiasco-maker\\"). Common fiasco sizes of the time were the quarto (\\"quarter\\", 5.7 liters), mezzo quarto (\\"half quarter\\", 2.28 liters), and metadella (\\"small half\\", 1.4 liters). It is not known, however, when the straw covering was introduced. A 14th century painting by Tomaso da Modena shows a small rounded flask, completely wrapped with cords of some kind. Other artistic depictions were provided by Botticelli (') and Ghirlandaio (Buonomini di San Martino and The Birth of John the Baptist). The earliest fragments of sala-covered bottles date from the 15th century. Throughout its history, the fiasco was found on the tables of peasants and Popes alike. A decree from 1574 fixed the capacity of the mezzo quarto bottle, and established a public office that would certify the capacity of fiaschi by a lead seal applied to the straw covering. However, producers soon started re- using the baskets from discarded certified fiaschi to dress new sub-standard bottles. To avoid this common fraud, another decree from 1618 specified that the seal was to be applied to the glass bottle itself. In 1621, yet another decree mandated sealing the bottle's mouth with molten lead. For this reason, the straw cover had to be reduced, leaving the bottle bare from the \\"shoulder\\" up‚Äîan arrangement that persists to this day. By the early 20th century, the manufacture of fiaschi employed about 1000 glass blowers and 30,000 basket weavers. A manufacturer's association (Comissionaria Industria Fiaschi) was established at Empoli in 1933. Starting in the 1950s the manufacture of bottles and baskets was increasingly automated. At the same time, the Bordeaux-style bottle (bordolese) was becoming more popular among wine producers, displacing the fiasco. However, a 1965 law reserved the fiasco for wines of legally controlled denomination (Denominazione di Origine Controllata), restoring the prestige of that classical container. The fiasco is no longer commonly used in Italy for storing and selling wine, and its more common uses nowadays are as a souvenir for tourists or as a decorative item in restaurants and kitchens.  Basket features  The straw bands can be vertical or horizontal; the former was traditionally used for fiaschi destined to local markets, while the latter, with a reinforced base and more careful weaving, was chiefly used for export. The latter often used a basket of whitened straw, decorated with two stripes tinted in the Italian flag colors (red and green). The base is a torus made of scrap straw, tied with fine straw blades (salicchio). Centuries ago, the basket often included one or more handles of twisted straw; they are sometimes included in present-day fiaschi, often for decorative purposes only.

It is native to western and central Africa from Liberia to Uganda and Angola, and has become naturalized in the Philippines, Indonesia, Seychelles, the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Malaysia Cultivation and use The Coffea liberica tree grows up to 9 metres in height, producing larger fruits than those found on Coffea arabica trees. It was brought to Indonesia to replace the arabica trees killed by the coffee rust disease at the end of the 19th century. It is still found in parts of Central and East Java and West Kalimantan today. A rare and one-of-a-kind cultivar of liberica can be found in a secluded area of the Amazon Rainforest of Guyana. Liberica is also the main coffee species cultivated in the Philippines and Malaysia. The city of Lipa in those province of Batangas became the country's biggest producer of arabica in the 1880s until that industry collapsed from coffee rust in the 1890s, killing almost all arabica plants in the area and threatening the variety with extinction. As in Indonesia, the liberica bean was brought in to replace it. Today, Batangas and the neighboring province of Cavite are producers of a varietal of liberica known as (). In Malaysia it is generally grown in Malaysia's Coffee Belt on the west coast of Johor largely due to Javanese immigration to Malaysia in the 19th century. Liberica coffee beans are much larger than the more popular arabica and robusta beans. Due to its rareness and limited supply on a global level, the cost of regular liberica beans are on the higher end with premium liberica beans carrying a heavier price tag.

Plot summary The story takes place in and around Paris between May 1940 and June 1941. Jean Casson is a French motion-picture producer who specializes in gangster films and who possesses no political views to speak of. When the Germans defeat and conquer his country, Casson at first tries to continue his life and career as if nothing had happened. But that proves impossible; when the Germans arrest a few of his friends and associates Casson finds himself helping others to hide or escape. He is seen talking to questionable people, and before long his line is tapped and his movements followed. Eventually Casson must choose between a life of resistance or no life at all. Characters Jean Casson starts the novel as a moderately successful film producer, with the creative and organizational skills such a career would demand. He considers himself to be something of an individualist and a cynic. The reader is led to doubt his self-evaluation because of his ability to win and keep the trust of a wide variety of people. It is, in fact, the dangers facing people close to him that forces him into action against the Germans. Louis Fischfang is a screenwriter with whom Casson has often worked. As a Jew and a Communist, he is in considerable danger from the new regime. Casson helps him to disappear, putting himself beyond the point of no return in the process. Citrine is an actress, an old girlfriend of Casson's with whom he resumes an affair. While she plays no important role in the plot, she personifies the happy, civilized old world that he finally decides is worth fighting for. Colonel Guske is the Gestapo agent with whom Casson plays a lengthy game of cat-and-mouse. While not an evil or unlikable man himself, he is comfortable working within an evil system and goes about his job with lethal dedication.

It was formerly known as the Brighton Hotel & Casino. It consisted of a 21-story hotel tower with 532 rooms and a 5-story podium housing the casino and various other amenities. It was adjacent to Claridge Atlantic City and its parking garage was adjacent to the Madison Hotel. History =Construction and opening= The first Brighton Hotel (originally named the Brighton Cottage) was opened in 1876 on the site that would eventually become the Sands. It was demolished in 1959. The Brighton Hotel & Casino was built at a cost of $70 million by Greate Bay Casino Corporation, controlled by two local businessmen, Eugene Gatti and Arthur Kania. It opened on August 13, 1980. The Brighton was the fourth property to open following the 1977 legalization of casinos in Atlantic City, and the first to be built from the ground up, rather than as a renovation of an existing hotel. The developers hoped that the Brighton's quiet atmosphere and small size, about half that of the city's other casino hotels, would prove attractive to high rollers. Early marketing featured Bert Parks as a spokesman, and the slogan \\"Brighton Up\\". After less than a month in operation, Holiday Inns agreed to buy the Brighton for $121 million in cash and stock plus assumption of the property's $37 million mortgage. Holiday Inns pulled out of the deal a month later. As the Brighton headed into its first winter, the city's low season, it faced severe cash flow problems, with lower monthly revenue than all its competitors. =Pratt era (1981-1998)= The Brighton was rescued in the first months of 1981 by $10 million in financing from Inns of the Americas (a Dallas-based hotel operator, owned by the Pratt brothers) and financiers Burton and Richard Koffman. Inns of the Americas and the Koffmans went on to buy a 60 percent interest in the Brighton from Gatti and Kania for $30 million in May 1981. Inns of the Americas had recently bought the Sands Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, and immediately renamed the Atlantic City property under the well-known Sands name. The property soon became profitable under its new ownership. The Pratts soon sold the Sands in Las Vegas back to its previous owner, but the Atlantic City property retained the Sands name under a licensing agreement, despite no longer having any affiliation with its namesake. In 1982, arcade game manufacturer Williams Electronics began an effort to take over the Sands, buying Gatti and Kania's shares, and agreeing to buy the Koffmans' shares. A white knight soon appeared, in the form of Drew National Corp., a New York-based conglomerate, which agreed to buy the Koffmans' interest. The deal foundered when Drew's major shareholders, Robert Bass and his brothers, refused to make financial disclosures required by the gaming licensing process. Part 2 A restructuring was eventually completed in 1985, with the Sands wholly owned by Pratt Hotel Corporation, which in turn was 52%-owned by Pratt's former shareholders, 35% by the Southmark Corporation of Texas, and 10% by Drew's shareholders. At its peak, the Sands headlined top entertainers, such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Cher, Liza Minnelli, Bob Dylan, Robin Williams, Whitney Houston & Eddie Murphy, among others. However, Sands was soon eclipsed by newer Atlantic City casinos and, at the time of its closing, had become the smallest of the city's 12 casinos. The Sands joined with the neighboring Claridge Hotel and Casino to build an elevated moving sidewalk, opened in 1988, to bring visitors from the boardwalk to the two properties. Pratt Hotel announced plans in 1987 to build a sister property called the Sands Boardwalk at the site of the unfinished Penthouse Boardwalk Hotel and Casino, while the existing property would be renamed as the Sands Park. Later reports had the new property's name as the Hollywood Hotel and Casino, or the Sands Hollywood. The plan was killed when Penthouse instead sold the site to Donald Trump in March 1989. The Sands took over the long vacant Jefferson Hotel, adjacent to its parking garage, in 1989, to be converted into administrative offices. In the early 1990s, as legalized gambling spread to new states, the Pratts established Hollywood Casino Corp. (HWCC) to develop new casinos under the Hollywood Casino name. At the time of its initial public offering in 1993, HWCC owned an 80 percent stake in Pratt Hotel. A second-floor gaming area was opened in 1994, with a ribbon-cutting by Governor Christie Whitman. The extra , including a new racebook, gave the Sands the fourth largest casino in Atlantic City. The Sands announced a new plan in 1994 to rebrand itself as a Hollywood Casino within two years. A video store was opened at the property, along with the film-themed \\"Epic Buffet\\", decorated with props from classic movies. The rebranding was never completed. As the Sands's high debt load and poor cash flow dragged down its parent company, HWCC decided in 1996 to divest itself of the property. At year's end, all of HWCC's stock in Pratt Hotel was distributed to HWCC shareholders, and Pratt Hotel was renamed as Greate Bay Casino Corporation. =Bankruptcy and Icahn era (1998-2006)= In 1998, the Sands filed for bankruptcy protection. While in bankruptcy, it was not required to make its $25 million in annual payments to bondholders, freeing up cash for a minor expansion. The Sands spent $10 million to buy the adjacent Midtown-Bala Hotel, which had separated it from Pacific Avenue, the main thoroughfare running parallel to the boardwalk. The Midtown-Bala was demolished to make way for a new entryway and porte-cochere, which were unveiled in June 2000. Park Place Entertainment and financier Carl Icahn put forth competing plans to take over and reorganize the company. Icahn's plan was selected by the bankruptcy court, and the business was reorganized in September 2000 as the publicly traded GB Holdings Inc., with Icahn owning a 65 percent share. The Claridge also filed for bankruptcy in August 1999, and Icahn fought to gain control of it as well, hoping to combine its operations with those of the Sands, but Park Place instead won ownership of the Claridge and merged it into Bally's. Icahn later transferred most of the interest in the Sands to another of his companies, American Real Estate Partners, sending GB Holdings into bankruptcy in September 2005. The Sands took over the adjacent historic Madison Hotel in 2000 under a lease agreement. By adding the Madison's units to its room count, the Sands was allowed to expand its casino floor by . The Sands spent $25 million on a renovation of the Madison, completed in 2005, turning the hotel's 230 rooms into 126 suites. In May 2006, American Real Estate Partners purchased the vacant former site of the Traymore Hotel from Harrah's Entertainment for $61 million. The Traymore site separated the Sands from the boardwalk, which had always hampered the Sands's ability to expand, and reduced its attractiveness to potential buyers. Icahn indicated that he might use the Traymore site for an expansion of the Sands, or might bundle it together with the Sands for sale. In September 2006, Pinnacle Entertainment agreed to buy the Sands and the Traymore site for a total of $250 million, with plans to close and demolish the Sands, and build a larger casino. The Sands closed on November 11, 2006, and the sale to Pinnacle was completed days later. The building was imploded at 9:37 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on October 18, 2007;WPVI-TV/Action News implosion coverage the first-ever casino-hotel implosion on the East Coast. It was accompanied by a fireworks show and numerous parties along the boardwalk. Coincidentally, Sands was demolished less than 24 hours after the death of the last surviving member of the Rat Pack, comedian Joey Bishop. Sands Atlantic City was the last casino in North America to bear the famous Sands moniker until the new Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem opened on May 22, 2009. Pinnacle canceled its planned casino in 2010, and sold the land in 2013 for $29.5 million to a group of local developers who planned to build a casino or family entertainment attraction.

Overview  Traditional train braking systems use pneumatic valves to control and generate brake applications on the cars along the length of the train. In general, this conventional system consists of a brake pipe that runs the length of the train which supplies air to reservoirs mounted on each of the cars. When the brake pipe and car components are charged with air, the brakes release. When the engineer needs to make a brake application, control valves in the locomotive reduce the brake pipe pressure. As the brake pipe pressure reduces, the service portion on each car divert air from their reservoirs to their brake cylinders. To release the brakes, the engineer charges the brake pipe. This method of controlling the brakes on freight and passenger cars has been virtually the same since its invention by George Westinghouse in 1868. The conventional braking system suffers from many weaknesses; one of which is in the reaction time. Because the engineer controls the flow of air into and out of the brake pipe from the locomotive, it can take up to two minutes for a commanded brake application to propagate to the back of a long freight train. This uneven braking can cause significant forces to build up between the cars in a train. Also, since the brake pipe is typically used for control and supply of air to the cars, if an engineer is not careful, the air supply can be depleted. Further, since the engineer is only aware of the brake pipe pressure and flow of air into the brake pipe, it is not easy to know the state of the train brakes at any given time. In contrast, ECP braking uses electronic controls which make it possible to activate air-powered brakes on the cars. On an ECP-equipped train, the cars are equipped with a Trainline Cable that runs parallel to the brake pipe down the length of the train. This cable is used to supply power to the electronic components installed on the cars. The cable also doubles as a communication medium that allows the locomotive to send commands and receive feedback from the cars and the End of Train. ECP provides many benefits over the traditional braking system. For example, since all the cars receive the brake command at the same time, the brakes are applied uniformly and instantaneously. This provides much better train control, shortens the stopping distances, and leads to a lower risk of derailment or of coupling breakage. Also with ECP, the brake pipe remains charged during operation. This allows the reservoirs on the cars to continuously charge making it more difficult to exhaust the air supply used for braking. Further, since the cars can also send their status to the locomotive at the front, the engineer can monitor the state of the train and know at any given time the braking capabilities available. The ECPB can also apply the brakes on the rearmost wagons, slightly before the brakes on the front wagons are applied, which reduces the shock and noise of the wagons bunching up.  Testing  During initial testing the ECP equipment had software glitches, and problems from the ingress of moisture into the equipment. These have now been resolved. Greater intervals between brake tests are also likely because of the ability of ECP brakes to self-diagnose which should generate large cost savings that will help pay for the system to be installed.Federal Railroad Administration The benefits are better control of braking, less equipment wear from pushing and pulling between cars, shorter stopping distance and improved headways.International Railway Journal April 2000 p23  Control and power  When first developed, ECP brakes needed a number of wires along the train to control solenoids on each wagon to release the brakes, and were not considered economic for freight. This has changed with the introduction of electronic controls, allowing data to be transmitted by two-conductor wire or radio from the locomotive to a microprocessor on each car, where locally powered valves hold the desired pressure in each brake cylinder.  Use on Fortescue Railway  ECP can use axle-generated power or wire-distributed power. The Fortescue Railway in Australia uses wire- distributed power at 200 volts direct current. The Fortescue line also places the two brake pipes and single control/power cables on one side of the wagons only, as trains operate only as block loads and the wagons are not normally reversed. Having the wires on one side avoids the need for crew to stoop under the coupling, as would be the case with the normal configuration where the hose and wire cross under the coupling.  Compatibility  ECP brakes by the two manufacturers are meant to be mutually compatible. The New York Brake Company, based in Watertown, N.Y., is a unit of Knorr-Bremse, based in Munich, Germany. Wabtec Railway Electronics, or WRE, a unit of Wabtec Corporation,https://www.wabtec.com/business-units/wabtec-railway-electronics has facilities in Germantown, MD, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In the case of the Fortescue railway, the new ECP brakes are incompatible in several ways. * The wagon-to-wagon pipes are straight and are on one side of the wagon only, and do not cross over to the other side underneath the coupling. * Wagons are one- sided, though locomotives are dual-sided for flexibility. The wagons are one- sided to suit a rotary tippler.http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11340333-s15.htm  Timeline and examples  * 1968: Mitsubishi Electric delivered \\"MBS type electric command brake control unit\\" for 7000 and 8000 Class EMU of Osaka Municipal Subway . * 1971: TRTA 6000 series EMU for Chiyoda Subway line, ECP in combination with chopper circuit regenerative brake system. * 1982: 200 Series EMU of Tohoku Shinkansen and Joetsu Shinkansen (the bullet trains), the first example of the ECP on high-speed trains in Japan. * 1990s: First trials on BN.

Distributed power  Distributed power is a system where locomotives are coupled in the middle and/or end of a heavy train and remotely controlled originally via radio from the locomotive in the front.

The population in 2011 was 3,308,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 4.22 km¬≤. Formerly a fishermen's town, Monte Gordo's economy is nowadays oriented to tourism due to its sunny weather, long white sand beaches, trails in the surrounding pine woods, sand dunes, and the daily availability of fresh seafood gathered by the local artisan fishermen. Furthermore, the adjacent natural reserve - Reserva Natural do Sapal de Castro Marim e Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio - attracts tourists due to its diverse fauna, which comprises some 153 species of birds, including storks, avocets, sandpipers and flocks of flamingos, as well as more than 400 plant species and various reptiles, amphibians and mammals. Its strategic location is also a plus, given that is located adjacent to the cities of Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio and Castro Marim, as well as other nearby touristic attractions such as Cacela Velha and Tavira. Prior to the Carnation Revolution in 1974, Monte Gordo was a favorite destination for the Portuguese and Spanish aristocracies as well as famous people (e.g. Ingrid Bergman). Its Casino was built in 1934 and Hotel Vasco da Gama was the first grand hotel in Algarve (built in 1960). With democracy, Monte Gordo became a favorite summer destination for the Portuguese middle class. Monte Gordo beach is best known for its sunny weather all year round, as well as for its relatively calm and warm seawater. The average air temperature ranges from a low of 11 ¬∞C in January to a high of 26 ¬∞C in August, while the average sea temperature ranges from a low of 16 ¬∞C in February to a high of 22 ¬∞C between July and September, making this the maritime beach with the warmest sea in mainland Portugal. Another particularity of this beach is the fact that during the low tide one is able to walk 10 to 30 meters into the sea, making it one of the safest in Portugal for children. These conditions make it ideal for beach goers to collect clams lightly buried in the sand (locals call \\"conquilhas\\" to the local variety of clams). Monte Gordo beach holds the Blue Flag quality certificate for more than 2 decades. Though most tourists are Portuguese during the summer, in the winter Monte Gordo is mostly visited by foreigners from Northern Europe looking for warm weather, tasty seafood, and a safe and peaceful vacation destination. Given the nearby VRSA Sports Complex, accredited by IAAF and home of the Portuguese Olympic Committee, Monte Gordo is also a favorite destination for international athletes and teams during the winter. Not surprisingly, the local commerce has adapted to demand and now there are also several Dutch and Irish bars as well as restaurants (most of then owned by expatriates from those countries) alongside the traditional Portuguese venues. Monte Gordo is a small town but it has most services and amenities one may need, from pharmacies to banks, kids playgrounds, tennis courts, as well as several hotels and apartment rentals. Several high quality golf courses are located nearby. The main festivity in Monte Gordo is the Nossa Senhora das Dores Procession, a catholic celebration held on the second Sunday of September. Its new year and carnival festivities are also well-known.

The band consisted of D√† ZhƒÅng Wƒõi (lead vocals, guitar) (Â§ßÂº†‰ºü), Sh√≠ X«êngy≈≠ (guitar) (Áü≥ÈÜíÂÆá), Gu≈ç Y√°ng (bass guitar) (ÈÉ≠Èò≥), and W√°ng W√©nb√≥ (drums, percussion) (ÁéãÊñáÂçö). The Flowers recorded and released six studio albums before splitting up in 2009. History Zhang Wei, Guo Yang, and Wang Wenbo met while attending high school. During their early career, they played music in the style of pop punk that was reminiscent of American pop punk bands such as Green Day and Blink-182 who were the group's influences. The band first began playing in local bars and smoky clubs around Beijing. Unable to hide their hunger for commercial success, the band became somewhat aloof from the scene and often derided in some quarters for their attitudes. The trio first signed to a small Beijing-based Chinese independent label, New Bees Music in 1998. A year later, the band released their debut studio album, On the Other Side of Happiness. The album turned out to be a surprise hit as the accessible nature of songs like \\"Stillness\\", \\"Disillusion\\" and \\"School's Out\\" from the album made the band perfect for the music market they had wished to conquer. The band became somewhat credited for helping to give disaffected Chinese youths a resonant voice, as many of them were deeply affected by their songs and felt that the band's lyrics reflected their own life experiences. As a result, punk music in general became more widely known in China. In light of the band's commercial impact, some over enthusiastic commentators even went as far declaring the Flowers as the true bringers of punk to the Chinese. They pointed out that fans had previously found even the acoustic grunge of Nirvana's MTV Unplugged in New York difficult to comprehend. The Flowers became involved in a two- year-long lawsuit with their first company, New Bees Music. The dispute almost brought the band to a premature end, but was eventually settled out of court. They signed to EMI in 2001 and brought in a fourth member, guitarist Shi Xingyu. Strawberry Statement, the Flowers' second album was released in December 2001. By this time, the group had become tired of the simple but effective music which had made them popular. The band was looking to diversify its sound. The Flowers recorded and released their third studio album, I Am Your Romeo in July 2004. On the album, the band experimented with various musical styles including hip hop and techno. The band seemed to be a long way from their punk roots but were as straightforward as ever in their ideals... or lack of them. Da Zhang Wei said, \\"We have to earn our living through music... Pleasing our fans is our reason for making music and we don't care about other things.\\" The songs itself still remained fairly upbeat and the lyrics pretty direct, although Zhang Wei softened the tone moderately for some of the love related songs. The band released an impending song, \\"Xi Shua Shua\\", in 2005. The song became a hit on the mainland. It was included on the band's fourth studio album, Hua Ji Wang Chao, or Blooming Dynasty, released in July 2005. The album won numerous awards around China and sold some 200,000 copies in the forty days after its release and was considered a great success in the country's pop music scene. The Flowers made an appearance at the China Central Television's Lantern Festival gala show later that year. The group was also nominated by organizers of the Pepsi Music Chart Awards in China for awards in categories such as Best Arrangement, Best Lyrics, Best Composer and Best Rock 'n' Roll Band. The nominations were later canceled by the board of judges when plagiarism accusations involving the band came to light. Hua Tian Xi Shi, the Flowers' fifth album, was released in September 2006. =Hua Ling Sheng Hui (2007-2009)= The Flowers would soon release their sixth studio album, Hua Ling Sheng Hui, or Flower Age Pageant in September 2007. The songs were very much different from the band's previous efforts as the group had gone deeper into their Chinese roots incorporating elements of upbeat music, ballads and dance-pop. In an interview, Zhang Wei explained his motive was to incorporate traditional Chinese performances and cultural treasures to the younger audience hoping they would enjoy the bouncy feel of their first single off the album, \\"Qiong Kaixin\\" (or \\"Shiny Happiness\\") and, at the same time embrace traditional Chinese culture. The same year, the Flowers received the award for Best Mainland Band at the China Music Awards. The Flowers were asked to write and perform a Mandarin version of the theme song of the hit Disney film High School Musical 2 which the group happily agreed to.Yuan Yuan. The band also expressed interest in movie acting and at the time were preparing for a New Year film celebrating 2009 where they would play street rowdies of ancient Beijing who get involved in comical situations. =Shi Xingyu leaves, break-up and solo careers= In July 2008, it was announced by the Flowers' record label that the band's guitarist, Shi Xingyu, quit the band after seven years with the group. Following Xingyu's departure, the band held a talent competition in Beijing with fifty contestants competing to be a new member of the Flowers. The winner would have been able to participate in the recording of the band's new album and its upcoming tenth anniversary concert tour. However, on 21 June 2009, the Flowers eventually decided to go their separate ways. After the band's break-up, Zhang Wei embarked on a solo career, releasing his debut solo album in August 2009.  Controversy  =Plagiarism accusations and scandal= The band's increasing fame soon brought their works under closer scrutiny. The group suddenly found themselves accused of plagiarism when it was discovered that they had copied at least twelve of their songs from various foreign artists including the song \\"Xi Shua Shua,\\" which was most under fire due to its similarities to Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi's song \\"K2G\\", as well as \\"Hua Die Fei\\", which ostensibly sampled O-Zone's \\"Dragostea din tei\\". Under the credit of Zhang Wei, he and representatives of EMI admitted in an official statement to the press that while the songs were not plagiarised, there were some flaws in the songs. None of the artists have responded to the issue. Because of the media buzz surrounding the band and to avoid disputes and authentication problems, the Flowers chose to stay away from all music award ceremonies, dropping out of all music award competitions for the rest of 2006. Contrary to his belief, Zhang Wei claims he listens to hundreds of songs every week and when he writes the songs, some melodies come naturally without having to manifest their origins. Zhang Wei claimed to the press that he and his bandmates have so many tunes - from having listened up to 100 songs per day - stored in their heads that they \\"have no time to identify, revise and remove\\" ones which aren't theirs. In 2015, Belgian and Dutch media again reported of an overt case of plagiarism, this time regarding the song \\"Tong Hua Sheng Si Lian\\" which closely resembles the song \\"Heyah Mama\\" of the Belgian girl's band K3. =Fighting incident= In 2007, the band once again made headlines. Following the plagiarism scandal nearly a year before, the Flowers were seen eating at a restaurant in Beijing near Chaoyang Park. The group were seen talking and soon started arguing with one another. What began as loud talking led into a fight when Zhang Wei hit another band member and shoved another man who was trying to intervene, the report said. This whole scene was captured on cell phone by a man nearby who was also in the restaurant with his girlfriend. The band's label admitted that there was a dispute, claiming that it was all because they had different views on the band's upcoming album. According to a senior official from the record company, Zhang Yi, the quarrel began when Zhang Wei and another fellow band member expressed differences on the sound of the record. Zhang even added that the band felt very pressured during the recording after having been involved in a plagiarism scandal. Some have even questioned whether the fight was a mere publicity stunt to promote sales for the upcoming album, but Zhang Yi stated that the band was too busy to do so.

(originally released as Hairspray in the United States) is the fourth album by English 2 Tone ska revival band The Selecter, released in 1995 on Dojo Music in the United Kingdom as, under the name Hairspray, on Triple X Records in the United States. Following the band's reinvented sound on their previous album, The Happy Album (1994), the band recorded Pucker! in 1995 with help from guitarist Paul Seacroft. Establishing a new direction, the album mostly sees the band establishing a \\"mild-mannered\\" version of its ska sound while incorporating elements from new wave and power pop, leading to an uncharacteristic \\"bizarre blend of elements\\" which stretched the band's horizons. The album's lyrics are also unusually sunny and lightweight. The album was promoted with the single \\"Hairspray\\". Though neither the single nor the album charted, the album received mostly positive reviews, with the album's lively spirit, peppy couplet of cover versions and B.J. Cole's pedal steel guitar appearance, described by one critic as one of the most unusual elements of the album, being highlighted. The band toured in promotion of the album in 1995, leading to the live album Live at Roskilde Festival. Moon Ska Europe remastered and re-released the Hairspray version of the album in the UK in 2005. Background and recording After re-forming with a new line-up in 1991, consisting of founding members Pauline Black and Neol Davies alongside drummer Perry Melius and former Bad Manners members Nick Welsh and Martin Stewart, The Selecter underwent a live reunion tour, leading to the acclaimed live album Out in the Streets (1992). After its release, Davies and Melius left the band, and original member Arthur \\"Gaps\\" Hendrickson rejoined the band, sharing vocals with Black. The new line-up recorded the band's third studio album, The Happy Album, released in 1994. The album saw a change in direction for the band, taking influence from hip hop music, orchestral music, electronics and \\"contemporary rhythms,\\" while keeping the band's ska sound at its core. Although not a commercial success, The Happy Album won the band critical acclaim, and the band began work on its follow-up, Pucker!, in 1995. Unlike on The Happy Album, where he provided co-production, the band's bassist Nick Welsh produced Pucker! alone. In addition to the band's core line-up, the band also asked Paul Seacroft to play guitar on the album as an unofficial fifth member, and he agreed. Although the band were still signed to Triple X Records in the United States, the band signed a new contract with Dojo Records in the UK, and Pucker! was the band's first album for the label. Music and lyrics B.J. Cole plays pedal steel guitar on \\"Sugar Town\\". Pucker! marks another stylistic deviation for the band. According to Terry Rompers of Trouser Press, the album is mostly a \\"mild-mannered version\\" of the band's ska roots, \\"clinging to the familiar peppy keyboard, bass, guitar and snare syncopation of ska,\\" but also adding giddy elements from new wave music and power pop. The sound of the album has been compared to \\"the Yachts, perhaps, or the Go-Go's\\" discovering \\"some old Skatalites records.\\" Rompers described the album as containing a \\"harmlessly bizarre blend of elements\\" that helped distance the album from its predecessor, while Martin C. Strong saw the album as an attempt to broaden the band's horizons. In his overall review of the band's discography, Rompers said of the new direction taken by the band on Pucker!: Also unlike the band's previous albums, which featured political and bitter lyrics, the lyrics on Pucker! are sunny and lightweight, with the exception of \\"Then She Did\\", which has been described as a \\"misery epic.\\" The original songs on the album were written by Black and Welsh, although, similarly to The Happy Album, the album also contains two cover versions, namely \\"Sugar Town\\", originally written by Lee Hazlewood and performed by Nancy Sinatra, and Bob Dylan's 1966 single \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & #35\\". B. J. Cole appears as a guest musician on the band's cover of \\"Sugar Town\\", playing the pedal steel guitar. Rompers described his appearance on the song as one of the album's most unusual elements. Original song \\"Chocolate Whip\\" shows the album's \\"occasionally silly side,\\" while the band's cover version of \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & #35\\" has been described as a \\"cornball pot-centric version.\\" Release and reception Pucker! was released in the United Kingdom by Dojo Records on 22 August 1995. However, in the United States, the album was renamed Hairspray and given alternative album artwork. The Hairspray edition was released by Triple X Records in the United States on 12 September 1995. Dojo Music released the song \\"Hairspray\\" as a single in 1995 to promote the album, using the same cover artwork as the Hairspray version of the album. The single featured the songs \\"Hairspray\\" and \\"Die Happy\\" from the album as well as live versions of \\"Missing Words\\" and \\"On My Radio\\" recorded in Minneapolis in 1991. The album received both positive and mixed reviews from music critics. Terry Rompers of Trouser Press was favourable towards the album, saying that, although the album is a \\"surprising step backward,\\" the album's \\"harmlessly bizarre blend of elements [...] is surprisingly delightful.\\" More mixed in his assessment was Martin C. Strong in The Great Rock Discography, where he rated the album four out of ten and said that The Selecer \\"were trying too hard to convince the public they could expand their horizons\\" with the album. He also felt the album \\"was hardly going to prise the ska crown\\" from third wave ska bands like Mighty Mighty Bosstones and No Doubt. Slightly more favourable, however, was Colin Larkin, who rated the album three stars out of five in his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Being a low-key release, similar to the band's other albums of the 1990s and 2000s, neither the album, nor its single, entered the UK Albums Chart. The band toured in promotion of the album, leading to the live album Live at Roskilde Festival, which was recorded at Denmark's Roskilde Festival on 1 July 1995 and released in 1996 on Magnum Music. On 17 January 2005, record label Moon Ska Europe remastered and re-released the Hairspray version of the album in the United Kingdom for the first time, adding a music video of the song \\"On My Radio\\" as bonus CD-ROM content.

The book was first published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (HBJ), but they withdrew the book from circulation after a few weeks and returned the rights to Davis after citing that \\"certain facts and circumstances have arisen since publication.\\" Davis sued HBJ for $6 million in 1982 for breach of contract, alleging the recall came after a letter from the Post's executive editor, Benjamin C. Bradlee to the publisher; Bradlee called the publication of the book \\"completely irresponsible\\" and then listed 39 errors where his name appeared. The suit was settled out of court for $100,000. Synopsis This biography of Katharine Graham, including details of the death of her husband Philip Graham in 1963, advances some theories that have been met with considerable controversy. For example, Davis claimed that the source behind the Watergate scandal, popularly known as Deep Throat, was a CIA officer named Richard Ober (in fact, it was later revealed that Deep Throat had been FBI Associate Director Mark Felt). She also claims that the Washington Posts executive editor, Benjamin C. Bradlee, was part of a CIA propaganda plan to support the convictions of spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Criticism The book received unfavourable reviews from the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The New York Times and others. Davis' 1983 settlement with HBJ was heralded as a victory for writers by Eve Pell of The Nation, but Pell saw both at fault for failing to fact check.

Early life Bhosale was born on 15 January 1921 in the Kaledhon Satara district of Maharashtra. An alumnus of the Shahaji Law College in Kolhapur, he passed the Bar-at-law examination at Lincoln's Inn, London in 1951 following which he practiced in Satara as an advocate for a decade. Bhosale was imprisoned during 1941‚Äì42 for his participation in the freedom struggle. After relocating to Mumbai with his 5 children, Bhosale would go on to work at the high court & hold several notable political offices in the years to come.  Electoral politics  In 1978, Bhosale contested to and lost the Assembly election from the Nehru Nagar assembly constituency in Kurla, Mumbai as a candidate of the Congress Party. In 1980, he was elected to the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha from there and went on to become a minister and later chief minister during his first term as a Member of the Legislative Assembly. In the A R Antulay Ministry, Bhosale headed the law and judiciary portfolios before succeeding A.R Antulay as Chief Minister of Maharashtra.  Tenure as Chief Minister  Bhosale was chosen as Chief Minister by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in a move that snubbed senior Maratha leaders and surprised many including Bhosale himself. Although he was Chief Minister for only 377 days, Bhosale's tenure is remembered for several bold decisions that he took. Among these were a scheme for free education for girls till matriculation, the creation of the Gadchiroli district and the inauguration of the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court. Bhosale initiated several welfare measures for freedom fighters including a pension scheme for them and cracked down on a strike by policemen, dissolving the policemen's union that had the support of several senior Congress leaders. At the Vithoba Temple in Pandharpur, Bhosale's intervention led to the abolition of the system of 'Badwe' (priests) that had been a source of harassment to the devotees there. Bhosale was also well regarded for his wit & sense of humour. Bhosale's term as Chief Minister was however also marked by dissension within the Congress Party and allegations of corruption in the distribution of liquor distilling licences and allocation of flats in Bombay. Bhosale's rule ended on 1 February 1983 following Vasantrao Patil's election to the chief ministership by legislators of the Congress Party. Bhosale's cabinet had several people who went on to hold important offices later including Pratibha Patil who went on to become the President of India and Vilasrao Deshmukh who became the Chief Minister of Maharashtra.  Family  Bhosale was the son-in-law of Tulsidas Jadhav,a freedom fighter and Rajya Sabha member who sided with Indira Gandhi when she split the Indian National Congress in 1969. His brother Shivajirao Bhosale was a vice-chancellor of Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. Bhosale's son Dilip is judicial memberof Lokpal since March 2019. His youngest son Dr. Rajan is one of India's foremost authorities & pioneers in the field of sexual medicine & sex education. Death Bhosale died at the Bombay Hospital in Mumbai on 6 October 2007 at the age of 86. His wife Kalavati Bhosale survived him by 12 years and died in mid 2019.

Ber. 1890, 23, 1474.Feist, F. Ber. 1902, 35, 1538. Pyrroles are found in a variety of natural products with biological activity, so the synthesis of substituted pyrroles has important applications in medicinal chemistry.Furstner, A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003, 42¬∏ 3582-3603. Alternative methods for synthesizing pyrroles exist, such as the Knorr Pyrrole Synthesis and Paal-Knorr Synthesis. The Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis  Mechanism  Below is one published mechanism for the reaction:Li, J.J. Name Reactions; 4th ed.; Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Germany, 2009; p. 276. alt=Mechanism for the Hantzsch Pyrrole Synthesis The mechanism starts with the amine (1) attacking the Œ≤ carbon of the Œ≤-ketoesters (2), and eventually forming an enamine (3). The enamine then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the Œ±-haloketone (4). This is followed by the loss of H2O, giving an imine (5). This intermediate undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack, forming a 5-membered ring (6). Finally, a hydrogen is eliminated and the pi-bonds are rearranged in the ring, yielding the final product (7). An alternative mechanism has been proposed in which the enamine (3) attacks the Œ±-carbon of the Œ±-haloketone (4) as part of a nucleophilic substitution, instead of attacking the carbonyl carbon.Wang, Zerong. Comprehensive Organic Name Reactions and Reagents, 3 Volume Set; John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey, 2009; pp. 1326-1327. Generalized Reaction Under Mechanochemical Conditions A generalization of the Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis was developed by Estevez, et al.Estevez, V.; Villacampa, M.; Menendez, J.C. Chem. Commun. 2012, 49, 591-593. In this reaction highly substituted pyrroles can be synthesized in a one-pot reaction, with relatively high yields (60% - 97%). This reaction involves the high-speed vibration milling (HSVM) of ketones with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) and p-toluenesulfonic acid, to form an Œ±-iodoketone in situ. This is followed by addition of a primary amine, a Œ≤-dicarbonyl compound, cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) and silver nitrate, as shown in the scheme below: Reaction Scheme for Generalized Hantzsch Pyrrole Synthesis Applications =2,3-dicarbonylated pyrroles= 2,3-dicarbonylated pyrroles can be synthesized by a version of the Hantzsch Pyrrole Synthesis.Moss, T.A.; Nowak, T. Tetrahedron Lett. 2012, 53, 3056-3060. These pyrroles are particularly useful for total synthesis because the carbonyl groups can be converted into a variety of other functional groups. Reaction Scheme for Generalized Hantzsch Pyrrole Synthesis =Substituted Indoles= The reaction can also occur between an enamine and an Œ±-haloketone to synthesize substituted indoles, which also have biological significance.Jones, C.D; Suarez, T. J. Org. Chem. 1972, 37, 3622-3623. Reaction for Substituted Indols by Hantzsch Pyrrole Synthesis =Continuous Flow Chemistry= A library of substituted pyrrole analogs can be quickly produced by using continuous flow chemistry (reaction times of around 8 min.).Herath, A.; Cosford, N.D.P. Org. Lett. 2010, 12, 5182-5185. The advantage of using this method, as opposed to the in-flask synthesis, is that this one does not require the work-up and purification of several intermediates, and could therefore lead to a higher percent yield.

Setting The Zambezian flooded grasslands can be found on seasonally- or permanently-flooded lowlands in the basin of the Zambezi and neighboring river basins. These enclaves lie in the Zambezian region, a broad belt of seasonally-dry miombo and mopane savannas and woodlands that extend east and west across Africa, from northern Botswana, Namibia, and Angola in the west to Tanzania and Mozambique in the east. Large enclaves of flooded grassland include: * Kilombero Valley and Mkata Plain in southern Tanzania * Malagarasi-Muyovozi floodplain and Ugalla River floodplain in western Tanzania * Wembere River-Lake Kitangiri floodplain in Tanzania * The Okavango Delta in Botswana * around Lake Chilwa in Malawi * The Barotse Floodplain, Kafue Flats, Busanga Swamp, and Lukanga Swamp in the Zambezi basin of Zambia. * The upper Chambeshi River, Bangweulu Swamp, the Luapula River delta south of Lake Mweru, and Lake Mweru Wantipa in Zambia. The region has a tropical climate with a hot wet summer between November and March. Flora These patches of wetland contain grassland and swamp vegetation which varies from area to area within this widely spread ecoregion. Fauna Even during the dry season the floodplains sustain a great deal of wildlife including grazing African buffalo, wildebeest, and elephants, zebras, and giraffes, with hippopotamus and crocodiles in the waters. There are many antelopes such as waterbucks, pukus, elands, and lechwe, the Bangwelu Swamp in particular being home to black lechwe (Kobus leche smithermani), tsessebe, and sitatunga while the Kafue Flats have large groups of Kafue lechwe and Burchell's zebra. The large numbers of birds, especially waterbirds, in the floodplains include saddle-billed storks. There are two endemic reptiles; the Merara toad (Amietophrynus reesi) in the Kilombero valley, and the Barotse water snake (Crotaphopeltis barotseensis). Threats and preservation Despite the tsetse fly and the swampy water the floodplains have long been home to rural communities, such as the Lozi people in the Barotse Floodplain and the Tonga in the Kafue Flats, but are mostly unspoilt and large areas are protected. However, wildlife is still vulnerable to poaching and illegal farming or grazing of livestock. Meanwhile as the population in this part of Africa is continually growing demand for water and farmland places the floodplains under constant threat as land is polluted or farmed, grassland set on fire and rivers are dammed or diverted. The Kafue Flats have been drastically changed by the damming of the river and similar projects are planned for the Okavango. Protected areas include the Okavango Delta, the Bangweulu, Moyowosi and Kilombero swamps and the Kafue Flats and in addition Lake Chilwa is a Ramsar birding area. Of these Okavango is the largest and best-known, being mostly within the Moremi Game Reserve, having spectacular wildlife and a well- developed safari industry based in the town of Maun. In Zambia Lochinvar and Blue Lagoon National Parks are protected.

They claimed innocence, saying they were scapegoats for a police force that could not find the real criminals. Origins The two members of the Ludwig group were both sons of the upper bourgeoisie of the city and came from the Verona hinterland: Marco Furlan, resident of the prestigious Borgo Trento district, was the son of the Head of the Burns Unit of the Ospedale Civile Maggiore in Verona (in this regard, many of \\"Ludwig\\"'s victims who were burned alive was emblematic) and at the time of his arrest he was about to graduate in physics at the University of Padua; Wolfgang Abel lived in Negrar di Valpolicella, where his family had moved to after a period in Munich. The son of a managing director of a German insurance company, he was a graduate in mathematics with honours and worked in the same insurance company as his father. Furlan and Abel met in high school, soon finding themselves in agreement about needing to clean up the world from everything that they thought was \\"deviated\\": prostitutes, homeless, homosexuals, drug addicts, \\"sinful\\" priests, nightclubs and pornographic cinemas. Their relationship continued beyond school and was consolidated by virtue of the fact that both were part of a group of young people at the time, who used to meet in Piazza Vittorio Veneto in Borgo Trento. The crimes At each of these crime scenes was a leaflet, written in Italian, headed with the name \\"Ludwig\\" over a Nazi eagle and swastika. Each had a slogan, such as \\"We are the last of the Nazis\\" and \\"Death comes to those who betray the true god\\", and explained the reason for each murder. Abel and Furlan's criminal career together began on 25 August 1977 in Verona, when they burned Roma drug addict Guerrino Spinelli alive with four molotov cocktails in his Fiat 126. On 17 December 1978 the murder of homosexual waiter Luciano Stefanato followed, stabbed 30 times in Padua, with two blades later being stuck in back. Almost a year later, on 12 December 1979, Furlan and Abel stabbed 22-year-old drug addict Claudio Costa to death in Venice. The homicidal series continued in 1980 in Vicenza, with the axe murder of 52-year-old prostitute Alice Maria Baretta. On 25 November of the same year they claimed responsibility for the first time in the crimes, by sending a letter with the name Ludwig in the Il Gazzettino newspaper's headquarters in Mestre. They were also accused of having set a fire on 25 May 1981 to a small abandoned structure in Verona, La torretta di Lungadige San Giorgio, formerly a part of old Austrian fortifications, which had become a shelter for beggars, drug addicts and homeless people: 17-year-old Luca Martinotti, who was spending the night there with another friend, died, while his friend was seriously injured. They were acquitted of this crime, although a letter allegedly signed by Ludwig had reached the editorial office of la Repubblica. \\"LUDWIG OUR FAITH IS NAZISM OUR JUSTICE IS DEATH OUR DEMOCRACY IS EXTERMINATION LET IT BE KNOWN THAT WE HAVE PROMPTLY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRE AT SAN GIORGIO IN VERONA WITH A MESSAGE SENT TO 'LA REPUBBLICA' WE ATTACH A METAL DISK IDENTICAL TO ONE APPLIED ON THE LARGEST OF THE THREE USED TORCHES GOTT MIT UNS\\" On 20 July 1982, Ludwig targeted Father Gabriele Pigato and Father Giuseppe Lovato, both 70-year-old friars of the Monte Berico in Vicenza, both attacked while walking in via Gen. Cialdini (a street that runs along the walls of the general house) and hit with hammers by the two young men: Father Gabriele died immediately, while Father Giuseppe was transported in very serious condition to the San Bartolo Hospital, where he died shortly after. On 26 February 1983, the priest Don Armando Bison was killed in Trento, who was found with an awl stuck in the skull, with a crucifix attached. On 14 May 1983, they set fire to the red light cinema \\"Eros\\" in Milan, killing six people (including the 46-year-old doctor Livio Ceresoli, who entered the building to provide medical aid and who was posthumously awarded the Award for Civil Valor) and wounding 32 others. On 17 December of the same year, they struck again by burning the strip club \\"Red House\\" in Amsterdam and causing 13 deaths. On 8 January 1984, they started a fire at the \\"Liverpool Disco\\" in Munich, in which an Italian waitress who worked there died, with seven others injured; this last act was claimed in a leaflet sent to some newspapers, reading: At the Liverpool, they don't fuck anymore!  Last attack and capture  On the evening of 4 March 1984, the two criminals entered the Melamara Disco in Castiglione delle Stiviere in the Province of Mantua, where at the time there were 400 young people, most of whom were masked for a carnival party. In a moment of confusion, one of the two killers (disguised as a Pierrot) opened the emergency exit and let in his partner, who had two bags with as many gasoline canisters as they could carry. Half-hidden in a dark corner, Abel and Furlan began to pour gasoline on the carpet and set it on fire. The two, however, had not taken into account the fact that the Italian public premises had had to furnish fireproof coverings following the Cinema Statuto fire, which took place in Turin in February 1983. The disco's carpet was therefore flame resistant and slowed down the fire's propagation, which allowed a security officer to extinguish it. Once discovered, the two assassins tried to attack the bouncer to escape, but they were stopped, surrounded by the crowd and finally arrested by police, who saved them from being lynched by the patrons. The number of Ludwig's attacks ended with 28 dead and 39 wounded. Trial Abel was subjected to psychiatric examination, also requested by the defenders of Furlan, Tiburzio De Zuani and Piero Longo, but the accused refused to undergo the talks. Specialists Balloni and Reggiani claimed that Abel had a reduced ability to understand the consequences about his actions, and also claimed that he had grown up without the affective attention that allowed him to build a healthy personality, but this was very disputed. On 10 February 1987, both were sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment, while the public prosecutor had asked for both to be sentenced to life imprisonment.Il Messaggero, 23 April 2008 (in Italian) On 15 June 1988, the Court of Assizes of Venice appealed both for the beginning of imprisonment and ordered that Furlan be imprisoned in Casale di Scodosia, a town in the Province of Padua, from which Furlan fled in February 1991, just before the final sentence was handed down by Court of Cassation. He was captured in May 1995 in Crete, where he lived under a false name, and was brought back to Italy; in the meantime, on 10 April 1999, the Court of Appeal of Venice, presided by Nicola Lercario, had sentenced him to 27 years' imprisonment, with the sentence being confirmed on 11 February 1991 by the Court of Cassation. On the same occasion, Abel was also sentenced to 27 years. Shortly after the arrest in Crete,Source: Il Corriere della Sera Furlan tried to commit suicide in prison by trying to hang himself on the bars with a sheet, but remained unharmed.  Copycats  The name Ludwig was later taken up by other fanatics of the Italian far right, who had never had any contact with either Abel or Furlan, but through the newspapers they were attracted by their racist ideas. They decided to organize in the city of Florence on 27 February 1990, a mass beating ensuing against street vendors and immigrant drug dealers present in various parts of the city, leaving the Italian newspapers some flyers in which they claimed aggression by signing as Ludwig. Later they went on with bomb attacks against nomad camps in Tuscany, making numerous injuries against the Roma. Particularly bloody was a bomb attack on an immigrant camp in the Province of Pisa, where a little girl lost an eye and a hand. These violent actions caused much outrage because some victims of the attacks were children. This increased public pressure for an intervention by the Italian Police and the Carabinieri, who arrested the perpetrators of the attacks. The culprit were younger boys than Abel and Furlan, coming from different cities and, when questioned, they said they had never met Ludwig's members in prison, but wanted to copy them.  Release  On 18 April 2008, the news of the decision of the Milan Surveillance Court to disclose Marco Furlan to the social services was announced. Furlan, through his lawyer, Corrado Limentani, had asked to leave prison by day to return at night and on weekends. The judicial body refused his plea for release, but assigned him to social services, taking into the account the murderer's good conduct and now imminent release, scheduled for early 2009. The news did not fail to arouse controversy in the public opinion: protests in this regard began by the editorial staff of newspapers and magazines. On 24 April 2008, Furlan took his second degree with honors in computer engineering, while on 12 November 2010, he was released on probation for good behavior.Ludwig Group, Furlan is free In 2009, the residential detention measure for Wolfgang Abel was changed to house arrest, discounted in the family home in Valpolicella. After expiry of the sentence, after a further period of probation and the obligation to sign in Negrar, on 24 November 2016, the competent surveillance magistrate revoked the latter provision, giving Abel freedom. When interviewed by the Corriere del Veneto, Abel said that he was ready to make further unpublished statements and testimonies on his criminal experiences. Both criminals claimed that they no longer were in contact with each other.

War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation's military forces planned for in the 1920s, though real tension did not begin until the 1931 invasion of Manchuria by Japan. Over the next decade, Japan expanded slowly into China, leading to the Second Sino-Japanese war in 1937. In 1940 Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to embargo all imports into China, including war supplies purchased from the U.S. This move prompted the United States to embargo all oil exports, leading the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) to estimate it had less than two years of bunker oil remaining and to support the existing plans to seize oil resources in the Dutch East Indies. Planning had been underway for some time on an attack on the \\"Southern Resource Area\\" to add it to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Japan envisioned in the Pacific. The Philippines, at that time an American protectorate, were also a Japanese target. The Japanese military concluded an invasion of the Philippines would provoke an American military response. Rather than seize and fortify the islands, and wait for the inevitable U.S. counterattack, Japan's military leaders instead decided on the preventive Pearl Harbor attack, which they assumed would negate the American forces needed for the liberation and reconquest of the islands. (Later that same day [December 8, local time], the Japanese indeed launched their invasion of the Philippines). Planning for the attack on Pearl Harbor had begun in very early 1941, by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. He finally won assent from the Naval High Command by, among other things, threatening to resign. The attack was approved in the summer at an Imperial Conference and again at a second Conference in the fall. Simultaneously over the year, pilots were trained, and ships prepared for its execution. Authority for the attack was granted at the second Imperial Conference if a diplomatic result satisfactory to Japan was not reached. After the Hull note and final approval by Emperor Hirohito the order to attack was issued at the beginning of December. Background to conflict Tensions between Japan and the prominent Western countries (the United States, France, United Kingdom and the Netherlands) increased significantly during the increasingly militaristic early reign of Emperor Hirohito. Japanese nationalists and military leaders increasingly influenced government policy, promoting a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as part of Japan's alleged \\"divine right\\" to unify Asia under Hirohito's rule. Emperor Hirohito During the 1930s, Japan's increasingly expansionist policies brought it into renewed conflict with its neighbors, Russia and China (Japan had fought the First Sino-Japanese War with China in 1894‚Äì95 and the Russo-Japanese War with Russia in 1904‚Äì05; Japan's imperialist ambitions had a hand in precipitating both conflicts). In March 1933 Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in response to international condemnation of its conquest of Manchuria and subsequent establishment of the Manchukuo puppet government there. On January 15, 1936, Japan withdrew from the Second London Naval Disarmament Conference because the United States and the United Kingdom refused to grant the Japanese Navy parity with theirs.Lester H. Brune and Richard Dean Burns, Chronological History of U.S. Foreign Relations: 1932-1988, 2003, p. 504. A second war between Japan and China began with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937. Japan's 1937 attack on China was condemned by the U.S. and by several members of the League of Nations, including Britain, France, Australia and the Netherlands. Japanese atrocities during the conflict, such as the notorious Nanking Massacre that December, served to further complicate relations with the rest of the world. The U.S., Britain, France and the Netherlands each possessed colonies in East and Southeast Asia. Japan's new military power and willingness to use it threatened these Western economic and territorial interests in Asia. Beginning in 1938, the U.S. adopted a succession of increasingly restrictive trade restrictions with Japan. This included terminating its 1911 commercial treaty with Japan in 1939, further tightened by the Export Control Act of 1940. These efforts failed to deter Japan from continuing its war in China, or from signing the Tripartite Pact in 1940 with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, officially forming the Axis Powers. Japan would take advantage of Hitler's war in Europe to advance its own ambitions in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country not already involved in conflict with the signatory; this implicitly meant the U.S. By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent the unmistakable message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores‚Äîwith Germany and Italy in the Atlantic, and with Japan in the Pacific. The Roosevelt administration would not be dissuaded. it committed to help the British and Chinese through loans of money and materiel, and pledged sufficient continuing aid to ensure their survival. Thus the United States slowly moved from being a neutral power to one preparing for war.Parkes, Henry Bamford. Recent America, A History Of The United States Since 1900 (Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1946)Page. 635-645 In mid-1940 Roosevelt moved the U.S. Pacific Fleet to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to deter Japan.Shift Of Our Fleet To Atlantic Studied, New York Times, June 23, 1940 On October 8, 1940, Admiral James O. Richardson, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, provoked a confrontation with Roosevelt by repeating his earlier arguments to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Harold R. Stark and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox that Pearl Harbor was the wrong place for his ships. Roosevelt believed relocating the fleet to Hawaii would exert a \\"restraining influence\\" on Japan. Richardson asked the President if the United States was going to war. Roosevelt's view was: > At least as early as October 8, 1940, ...affairs had reached such a state > that the United States would become involved in a war with Japan. ...

Along with Japan's war with China, withdrawal from the League of Nations, alliance with Germany and Italy and increasing militarization, the move induced the United States to intensify its measures to restrain Japan economically. The United States embargoed scrap-metal shipments to Japan and closed the Panama Canal to Japanese shipping.Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming- kai, translated by Wen Ha-hsiung. History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), 2nd ed. (Taipei, Republic of China: Chung Wu Publishing, 1971), p.317, \\"Invasion of French Indochina\\". This hit Japan's economy particularly hard because 74.1% of Japan's scrap iron came from the United States in 1938. Also, 93% of Japan's copper in 1939 came from the United States. In early 1941 Japan moved into southern Indochina, thereby threatening British Malaya, North Borneo and Brunei. Japan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during the course of 1941 in an effort to improve relations. During these negotiations, Japan considered withdrawal from most of China and Indochina after drawing up peace terms with the Chinese. Japan would also adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact, and would not discriminate in trade, provided all other countries reciprocated. However General Tojo, then Japanese War Minister, rejected compromises in China.Chapter V: The Decision for War Morton, Louis. Strategy and Command: The First Two Years Responding to Japanese occupation of key airfields in Indochina (July 24) following an agreement between Japan and Vichy France, the U.S. froze Japanese assets on July 26, 1941, and on August 1 established an embargo on oil and gasoline exports to Japan.Worth, Roland H., Jr., No Choice But War: the United States Embargo Against Japan and the Eruption of War in the Pacific (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 1995). The oil embargo was an especially strong response because oil was Japan's most crucial import, and more than 80% of Japan's oil at the time came from the United States. Japanese war planners had long looked south, especially to Brunei for oil and Malaya for rubber and tin. In the autumn of 1940, Japan requested 3.15 million barrels of oil from the Dutch East Indies, but received a counteroffer of only 1.35 million. The Navy was certain any attempt to seize this region would bring the U.S. into the war,Peattie, Mark R. & Evans, David C. Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy (Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 1997). but the complete U.S. oil embargo reduced Japanese options to two: seize Southeast Asia before its existing stocks of strategic materials were depleted, or submission to American demands. Moreover, any southern operation would be vulnerable to attack from the Philippines, then a U.S. commonwealth, so war with the U.S. seemed necessary in any case. After the embargoes and the asset freezes, the Japanese ambassador to Washington, Kichisabur≈ç Nomura, and U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull held multiple meetings in order to resolve Japanese-American relations. No solution could be agreed upon for three key reasons: # Japan honored its alliance to Germany and Italy through the Tripartite Pact. # Japan wanted economic control and responsibility for southeast Asia (as envisioned in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere). # Japan refused to leave mainland China (without its puppet state of Manchukuo). La Feber, Walter. Polenberg, Richard The American Century, A History Of The United States Since the 1890s (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), pp. 243-247. In their final proposal on November 20, Japan offered to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina and not to launch any attacks in southeast Asia provided the U.S., Britain, and the Netherlands ceased aiding China and lifted their sanctions against Japan. The American counterproposal of November 26 (the Hull note) required Japan to evacuate all of China, unconditionally, and to conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers. Breaking off negotiations Part of the Japanese plan for the attack included breaking off negotiations with the United States 30 minutes before the attack began. Diplomats from the Japanese embassy in Washington, including the Japanese ambassador, Admiral Kichisabur≈ç Nomura and special representative Sabur≈ç Kurusu, had been conducting extended talks with the State Department regarding the U.S. reactions to the Japanese move into French Indochina in the summer. In the days before the attack, a long 14-part message was sent to the embassy from the Foreign Office in Tokyo (encrypted with the Type 97 cypher machine, in a cipher named PURPLE by U.S. cryptanalysts), with instructions to deliver it to Secretary of State Cordell Hull at . The last part arrived late Saturday night (Washington time), but because of decryption and typing delays, as well as Tokyo's failure to stress the crucial necessity of the timing, embassy personnel did not deliver the message to Secretary Hull until several hours after the attack. The United States had decrypted the 14th part well before the Japanese managed to, and long before embassy staff composed a clean typed copy. The final part, with its instruction for the time of delivery, had been decoded Saturday night but was not acted upon until the next morning (according to Henry Clausen). Ambassador Nomura asked for an appointment to see Hull at , but later asked it be postponed to 1:45 as the ambassador was not quite ready. Nomura and Kurusu arrived at and were received by Hull at 2:20. Nomura apologized for the delay in presenting the message. After Hull had read several pages, he asked Nomura whether the document was presented under instructions of the Japanese government; the Ambassador replied it was. After reading the full document, Hull turned to the ambassador and said: > I must say that in all my conversations with you...during the last nine > months I have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out > absolutely by the record. In all my fifty years of public service I have > never seen a document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and > distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I > never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of > uttering them.Memorandum 95 Regarding a Conversation, Between the Secretary > of State, the Japanese Ambassador (Nomura), and Mr. Kurusu Peace and War: > United States Foreign Policy 1931-1941 (Department of State, Washington, DC > 1943) Japanese records, admitted into evidence during congressional hearings on the attack after the war, established that Japan had not even written a declaration of war until hearing news of the successful attack. The two-line declaration was finally delivered to U.S. ambassador Joseph Grew in Tokyo about ten hours after the completion of the attack. Grew was allowed to transmit it to the United States, where it was received late Monday afternoon (Washington time). =War= Prime Minister of Japan Hideki T≈çj≈ç In July 1941, IJN headquarters informed Emperor Hirohito its reserve bunker oil would be exhausted within two years if a new source was not found. In August 1941, Japanese prime minister Fumimaro Konoe proposed a summit with President Roosevelt to discuss differences. Roosevelt replied Japan must leave China before a summit meeting could be held. On , at the second Imperial Conference concerning attacks on the Western colonies in Asia and Hawaii, Japanese leaders met to consider the attack plans prepared by Imperial General Headquarters. The summit occurred one day after the emperor had reprimanded General Hajime Sugiyama, chief of the IJA General Staff, about the lack of success in China and the speculated low chances of victory against the United States, the British Empire and their allies. Prime Minister Konoe argued for more negotiations and possible concessions to avert war. However, military leaders such as Sugiyama, Minister of War General Hideki T≈çj≈ç, and chief of the IJN General Staff Fleet Admiral Osami Nagano asserted time had run out and that additional negotiations would be pointless. They urged swift military actions against all American and European colonies in Southeast Asia and Hawaii. T≈çj≈ç argued that yielding to the American demand to withdraw troops would wipe out all the gains of the Second Sino-Japanese War, depress Army morale, endanger Manchukuo and jeopardize control of Korea; hence, doing nothing was the same as defeat and a loss of face. On October 16, 1941, Konoe resigned and proposed Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, who was also the choice of the army and navy, as his successor. Hirohito chose Hideki T≈çj≈ç instead, worried (as he told Konoe) about having the Imperial House being held responsible for a war against Western powers. Prince Takamatsu On November 3, 1941, Nagano presented a complete plan for the attack on Pearl Harbor to Hirohito. At the Imperial Conference on November 5, Hirohito approved the plan for a war against the United States, Great Britain and the Netherlands, scheduled to start at the beginning of December if an acceptable diplomatic settlement were not achieved before then. Over the following weeks, T≈çj≈ç's military regime offered a final deal to the United States. They offered to leave only Indochina, but in return for large American economic aid. On November 26, the so-called Hull Memorandum (or Hull Note) rejected the offer and demanded that, in addition to leaving Indochina, the Japanese must leave China (without Manchoukuo) and agree to an Open Door Policy in the Far East.OUTLINE OF PROPOSED BASIS FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN Peace and War: United States Foreign Policy 1931-1941 (Department of State, Washington, DC 1943) K≈çichi Kido On November 30, 1941, Prince Takamatsu warned his brother, Hirohito, the navy felt the Empire could not fight more than two years against the United States and wished to avoid war. After consulting with K≈çichi Kido (who advised him to take his time until he was convinced) and T≈çj≈ç, the Emperor called Shigetar≈ç Shimada and Nagano, who reassured him that war would be successful. On December 1, Hirohito finally approved a \\"war against United States, Great Britain and Holland\\" during another Imperial Conference, to commence with a surprise attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at its main forward base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. =Intelligence gathering= On February 3, 1940, Yamamoto briefed Captain Kanji Ogawa of Naval Intelligence on the potential attack plan, asking him to start intelligence gathering on Pearl Harbor. Ogawa already had spies in Hawaii, including Japanese Consular officials with an intelligence remit, and he arranged for help from a German already living in Hawaii who was an Abwehr agent. None had been providing much militarily useful information. He planned to add 29-year-old Ensign Takeo Yoshikawa. By the spring of 1941, Yamamoto officially requested additional Hawaiian intelligence, and Yoshikawa boarded the liner Nitta-maru at Yokohama. He had grown his hair longer than military length, and assumed the cover name Tadashi Morimura. Yoshikawa began gathering intelligence in earnest by taking auto trips around the main islands, and toured Oahu in a small plane, posing as a tourist. He visited Pearl Harbor frequently, sketching the harbor and location of ships from the crest of a hill. Once, he gained access to Hickam Field in a taxi, memorizing the number of visible planes, pilots, hangars, barracks and soldiers. He was also able to discover that Sunday was the day of the week on which the largest number of ships were likely to be in harbor, that PBY patrol planes went out every morning and evening, and that there was an antisubmarine net in the mouth of the harbor. Information was returned to Japan in coded form in Consular communications, and by direct delivery to intelligence officers aboard Japanese ships calling at Hawaii by consulate staff. In June 1941, German and Italian consulates were closed, and there were suggestions Japan's should be closed, as well. They were not, because they continued to provide valuable information (via MAGIC) and neither President Franklin D. Roosevelt nor Secretary of State Cordell Hull wanted trouble in the Pacific. Had they been closed, however, it is possible Naval General Staff, which had opposed the attack from the outset, would have called it off, since up-to-date information on the location of the Pacific Fleet, on which Yamamoto's plan depended, would no longer have been available. =Planning= Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto Expecting war, and seeing an opportunity in the forward basing of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Hawaii, the Japanese began planning in early 1941 for an attack on Pearl Harbor. For the next several months, planning and organizing a simultaneous attack on Pearl Harbor and invasion of British and Dutch colonies to the south occupied much of the Japanese Navy's time and attention. The plans for the Pearl Harbor attack arose out of the Japanese expectation the U.S. would be inevitably drawn into war after a Japanese attack against Malaya and Singapore. The intent of a preventive strike on Pearl Harbor was to neutralize American naval power in the Pacific, thus removing it from influencing operations against American, British, and Dutch colonies. Successful attacks on colonies were judged to depend on successfully dealing with the Pacific Fleet. Planning had long anticipated a battle in Japanese home waters after the U.S. fleet traveled across the Pacific, under attack by submarines and other forces all the way. The U.S. fleet would be defeated in a \\"decisive battle\\", as Russia's Baltic Fleet had been in 1905. A surprise attack posed a twofold difficulty compared to longstanding expectations. First, the Pacific Fleet was a formidable force, and would not be easy to defeat or to surprise. Second, Pearl Harbor's shallow waters made using conventional aerial torpedoes ineffective. On the other hand, Hawaii's distance meant a successful surprise attack could not be blocked or quickly countered by forces from the continental U.S. Several Japanese naval officers had been impressed by the British action in the Battle of Taranto, in which 21 obsolete Fairey Swordfish disabled half the Regia Marina (Italian Navy). Admiral Yamamoto even dispatched a delegation to Italy, which concluded a larger and better- supported version of Cunningham's strike could force the U.S. Pacific Fleet to retreat to bases in California, thus giving Japan the time necessary to establish a \\"barrier\\" defense to protect Japanese control of the Dutch East Indies. The delegation returned to Japan with information about the shallow- running torpedoes Cunningham's engineers had devised. Japanese strategists were undoubtedly influenced by Admiral Togo's surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur in 1904. Yamamoto's emphasis on destroying the American battleships was in keeping with the Mahanian doctrine shared by all major navies during this period, including the U.S. Navy and Royal Navy.Willmott, Barrier; Miller, War Plan Orange.; Peattie & Evans, Kaigun; Mahan, The Influence of Sea Power on History. Planner Commander Minoru Genda stressed surprise would be critical. In a letter dated January 7, 1941, Yamamoto finally delivered a rough outline of his plan to Koshiro Oikawa, then Navy Minister, from whom he also requested to be made Commander in Chief of the air fleet to attack Pearl Harbor. A few weeks later, in yet another letter, Yamamoto requested Admiral Takijiro Onishi, chief of staff of the Eleventh Air Fleet, study the technical feasibility of an attack against the American base. Onishi gathered as many facts as possible about Pearl Harbor. After first consulting with Kosei Maeda, an expert on aerial torpedo warfare, and being told the harbor's shallow waters rendered such an attack almost impossible, Onishi summoned Commander Minoru Genda. After studying the original proposal put forth by Yamamoto, Genda agreed: \\"[T]he plan is difficult but not impossible\\". Yamamoto gave the bulk of the planning to Rear Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka, who was very worried about the area's air defenses. Yamamoto encouraged Kusaka by telling him, \\"Pearl Harbor is my idea and I need your support.\\" Genda emphasized the attack should be carried out early in the morning and in total secrecy, employing an aircraft carrier force and several types of bombing. Although attacking the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchor would achieve surprise, it also carried two distinct disadvantages. The targeted ships would be sunk or damaged in very shallow water, meaning it would be quite likely that they could be salvaged and possibly returned to duty (as six of the eight battleships eventually were). Also, most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor afterward. Despite these concerns, Yamamoto and Genda pressed ahead. By April 1941, the Pearl Harbor plan became known as Operation Z, after the famous Z signal given by Admiral T≈çg≈ç at Tsushima. Over the summer, pilots trained in earnest near Kagoshima City on Ky≈´sh≈´. Genda chose it because its geography and infrastructure presented most of the same problems bombers would face at Pearl Harbor. In training, each crew flew over the mountain behind Kagoshima and dove into the city, dodging buildings and smokestacks before dropping to at the piers. Bombardiers released torpedoes at a breakwater some away. However, even this low-altitude approach would not overcome the problem of torpedoes bottoming in the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. Japanese weapons engineers created and tested modifications allowing successful shallow water drops. The effort resulted in a heavily modified version of the Type 91 torpedo, which inflicted most of the ship damage during the eventual attack. Japanese weapons technicians also produced special armor-piercing bombs by fitting fins and release shackles to 14- and 16-inch (356- and 406-mm) naval shells. These were able to penetrate the lightly armored decks of the old battleships. =Concept of a Japanese invasion of Hawaii= At several stages during 1941, Japan's military leaders discussed the possibility of launching an invasion to seize the Hawaiian Islands; this would provide Japan with a strategic base to shield its new empire, deny the United States any bases beyond the West Coast and further isolate Australia and New Zealand. Genda, who saw Hawaii as vital for American operations against Japan after war began, believed Japan must follow any attack on Pearl Harbor with an invasion of Hawaii or risk losing the war. He viewed Hawaii as a base to threaten the west coast of North America, and perhaps as a negotiating tool for ending the war. He believed, following a successful air attack, 10,000-15,000 men could capture Hawaii, and saw the operation as a precursor or alternative to a Japanese invasion of the Philippines. In September 1941, Commander Yasuji Watanabe of the Combined Fleet staff estimated two divisions (30,000 men) and 80 ships, in addition to the carrier strike force, could capture the islands. He identified two possible landing sites, near Haleiwa and Kaneohe Bay, and proposed both be used in an operation that would require up to four weeks with Japanese air superiority. Although this idea gained some support, it was soon dismissed for several reasons: *Japan's ground forces, logistics, and resources were already fully committed, not only to the Second Sino-Japanese War but also for offensives in Southeast Asia that were planned to occur almost simultaneously with the Pearl Harbor attack. *The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) insisted it needed to focus on operations in China and Southeast Asia, and refused to provide substantial support elsewhere. Because of a lack of cooperation between the services, the IJN never discussed the Hawaiian invasion proposal with the IJA. *Most of the senior officers of the Combined Fleet, in particular Admiral Nagano, believed an invasion of Hawaii was too risky. With an invasion ruled out, it was agreed a massive carrier-based three wave airstrike against Pearl Harbor to destroy the Pacific Fleet would be sufficient. Japanese planners knew that Hawaii, with its strategic location in the Central Pacific, would serve as a critical base from which the United States could extend its military power against Japan. However, the confidence of Japan's leaders that the conflict would be over quickly and that the United States would choose to negotiate a compromise, rather than fight a long, bloody war, overrode this concern.Weinberg, Gerhard L., A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1994), pp. 260, 323, and 329-330.Willmott, H.P. The Barrier and the Javelin: Japanese and Allied Strategies, February to June 1942. (United States Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 1983) Watanabe's superior, Captain Kameto Kuroshima, who believed the invasion plan unrealistic, after the war called his rejection of it the \\"biggest mistake\\" of his life. Strike force Admiral Chuichi Nagumo On November 26, 1941, the day the Hull note (which the Japanese leaders saw as an unproductive and old proposal) was received, the carrier force under the command of Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (already assembled in Hitokappu Wan) sortied for Hawaii under strict radio silence. In 1941, Japan was one of the few countries capable of carrier aviation. The Kido Butai, the Combined Fleet's main carrier force of six aircraft carriers (at the time, the most powerful carrier force with the greatest concentration of air power in the history of naval warfare),US Department of the Navy description of Pearl Harbor Attack embarked 359 airplanes, organized as the First Air Fleet. The carriers (flag), , , , and the newest, and , had 135 Mitsubishi A6M Type 0 fighters (Allied codename \\"Zeke\\", commonly called \\"Zero\\"), 171 Nakajima B5N Type 97 torpedo bombers (Allied codename \\"Kate\\"), and 108 Aichi D3A Type 99 dive bombers (Allied codename \\"Val\\") aboard. Two fast battleships, two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, nine destroyers, and three fleet submarines provided escort and screening. In addition, the Advanced Expeditionary Force included 20 fleet and five two-man Ko-hyoteki-class midget submarines, which were to gather intelligence and sink U.S. vessels attempting to flee Pearl Harbor during or soon after the attack. It also had eight oilers for underway fueling.Order of Battle for Pearl Harbor Attack Fleet Admiral Osami Nagano =Execute order= On December 1, 1941, after the striking force was en route, Chief of Staff Nagano gave a verbal directive to the commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, informing him: Upon completion, the force was to return to Japan, re-equip, and re-deploy for \\"Second Phase Operations\\". Finally, Order number 9, issued on 1 December 1941 by Nagano, instructed Yamamoto to crush hostile naval and air forces in Asia, the Pacific and Hawaii, promptly seize the main U.S., British, and Dutch bases in East Asia and \\"capture and secure the key areas of the southern regions\\". On the home leg, the force was ordered to be alert for tracking and counterattacks by the Americans, and to return to the friendly base in the Marshall Islands, rather than the Home Islands.Japanese Monograph No. 97 Lack of preparation Lieutenant General Walter C. Short, commanding general of the Army post at Pearl Harbor U.S. civil and military intelligence had, amongst them, good information suggesting additional Japanese aggression throughout the summer and fall before the attack. At the time, no reports specifically indicated an attack against Pearl Harbor. Public press reports during summer and fall, including Hawaiian newspapers, contained extensive reports on the growing tension in the Pacific. Late in November, all Pacific commands, including both the Navy and Army in Hawaii, were separately and explicitly warnedNovember 28, 1941, message war with Japan was expected in the very near future, and it was preferred Japan make the first hostile act.ibiblio.org It was felt war would most probably start with attacks in the Far East: the Philippines,War warning, dated 27 November 1941 Indochina, Thailand, or the Russian Far East; Pearl Harbor was never mentioned as a potential target. The warnings were not specific to any area, noting only that war with Japan was expected in the near future and all commands should act accordingly. Had any of these warnings produced an active alert status in Hawaii, the attack might have been resisted more effectively, and perhaps resulted in less death and damage. On the other hand, recall of men on shore leave to the ships in harbor might have led to still more being casualties from bombs and torpedoes, or trapped in capsized ships by shut watertight doors (as the attack alert status would have required), or killed (in their obsolete aircraft) by more experienced Japanese aviators. When the attack actually arrived, Pearl Harbor was effectively unprepared: anti-aircraft weapons not manned, most ammunition locked down, anti-submarine measures not implemented (e.g., no torpedo nets in the harbor), combat air patrol not flying, available scouting aircraft not in the air at first light, Air Corps aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip to reduce sabotage risks (not ready to fly at a moment's warning), and so on. By 1941, U.S. signals intelligence, through the Army's Signal Intelligence Service and the Office of Naval Intelligence's OP-20-G, had intercepted and decrypted considerable Japanese diplomatic and naval cipher traffic, though nothing actually carrying significant information about Japanese military plans in 1940-41. Decryption and distribution of this intelligence, including such decrypts as were available, was capricious and sporadic, some of which can be accounted for by lack of resources and manpower.Kahn, David. The Codebreakers; Prange et al., Peaarl Harbor: The Verdict of History. At best, the information available to decision makers in Washington was fragmentary, contradictory, or poorly distributed, and was almost entirely raw, without supporting analysis. It was thus, incompletely understood. Nothing in it pointed directly to an attack at Pearl Harbor, and a lack of awareness of Imperial Navy capabilities led to a widespread underlying belief Pearl Harbor was not a possible attack target. Only one message from the Hawaiian Japanese consulate (sent on 6 December), in a low level consular cipher, included mention of an attack at Pearl; it was not decrypted until 8 December. While the Japanese Diplomatic codes (Purple code) could be read, the current version (JN-25C) of the Japanese Naval code (JN-25) which had replaced JN-25B on 4 December 1941 could not be read until May 1942. In 1924, General William L. Mitchell produced a 324-page report warning that future wars (including with Japan) would include a new role for aircraft against existing ships and facilities. He even discussed the possibility of an air attack on Pearl Harbor, but his warnings were ignored. Navy Secretary Knox had also appreciated the possibility of an attack at Pearl Harbor in a written analysis shortly after taking office. American commanders had been warned that tests had demonstrated shallow-water aerial torpedo attacks were possible, but no one in charge in Hawaii fully appreciated this. In a 1932 fleet problem, a surprise airstrike led by Admiral Harry E. Yarnell had been judged a success and to have caused considerable damage, a finding corroborated in a 1938 exercise by Admiral Ernest King. Nevertheless, because it was believed Pearl Harbor had natural defenses against torpedo attack (e.g., the shallow water), the Navy did not deploy torpedo nets or baffles, which were judged to inconvenience ordinary operations. As a result of limited numbers of long-range aircraft (including Army Air Corps bombers), reconnaissance patrols were not being made as often or as far out as required for adequate coverage against possible surprise attack (they improved considerably, with far fewer remaining planes, after the attack). The Navy had 33 PBYs in the islands, but only three on patrol at the time of the attack.Naval Air Station, Kanoehe Bay, during the Pearl Harbor Raid Hawaii was low on the priority list for the B-17s finally becoming available for the Pacific, largely because General MacArthur in the Philippines was successfully demanding as many as could be made available to the Pacific (where they were intended as a deterrent). The British, who had contracted for them, even agreed to accept fewer to facilitate this buildup. At the time of the attack, Army and Navy were both on training status rather than operational alert. There was also confusion about the Army's readiness status as General Short had changed local alert level designations without clearly informing Washington. Most of the Army's mobile anti-aircraft guns were secured, with ammunition locked down in armories. To avoid upsetting property owners, and in keeping with Washington's admonition not to alarm civil populations (e.g., in the late November war warning messages from the Navy and War Departments), guns were not dispersed around Pearl Harbor (i.e., on private property). Additionally, aircraft were parked on airfields to lessen the risk of sabotage, not in anticipation of air attack, in keeping with Short's interpretation of the war warnings. Chester Nimitz said later, \\"It was God's mercy that our fleet was in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\\" Nimitz believed if Kimmel had discovered the Japanese approach, he would have sortied to meet them. With the three American aircraft carriers (, , and ) absent and Kimmel's battleships at a severe disadvantage to the Japanese carriers, the likely result would have been the sinking of the American battleships at sea in deep water, where they would have been lost forever with tremendous casualties (as many as twenty thousand dead), instead of in Pearl Harbor, where the crews could easily be rescued, and six battleships ultimately raised.

Fourier analysis, the most used spectral method in science, generally boosts long-periodic noise in long gapped records; LSSA mitigates such problems. LSSA is also known as the Van√≠ƒçek method after Petr Van√≠ƒçek, and as the Lomb method (or the Lomb periodogram) and the Lomb‚ÄìScargle method (or Lomb‚ÄìScargle periodogram), based on the contributions of Nicholas R. Lomb and, independently, Jeffrey D. Scargle. Closely related methods have been developed by Michael Korenberg and by Scott Chen and David Donoho. Historical background The close connections between Fourier analysis, the periodogram, and least-squares fitting of sinusoids have long been known. Most developments, however, are restricted to complete data sets of equally spaced samples. In 1963, Freek J. M. Barning of Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam, handled unequally spaced data by similar techniques, including both a periodogram analysis equivalent to what is now referred to the Lomb method, and least-squares fitting of selected frequencies of sinusoids determined from such periodograms, connected by a procedure that is now known as matching pursuit with post-backfitting or orthogonal matching pursuit.Y. C. Pati, R. Rezaiifar, and P. S. Krishnaprasad, \\"Orthogonal matching pursuit: Recursive function approximation with applications to wavelet decomposition,\\" in Proc. 27th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, A. Singh, ed., Los Alamitos, CA, USA, IEEE Computer Society Press, 1993. Petr Van√≠ƒçek, a Canadian geodesist of the University of New Brunswick, also proposed the matching- pursuit approach, which he called \\"successive spectral analysis\\" and the result a \\"least-squares periodogram\\", with equally and unequally spaced data, in 1969. He generalized this method to account for systematic components beyond a simple mean, such as a \\"predicted linear (quadratic, exponential, ...) secular trend of unknown magnitude\\", and applied it to a variety of samples, in 1971. The Van√≠ƒçek method was then simplified in 1976 by Nicholas R. Lomb of the University of Sydney, who pointed out its close connection to periodogram analysis. The definition of a periodogram of unequally spaced data was subsequently further modified and analyzed by Jeffrey D. Scargle of NASA Ames Research Center, who showed that with minor changes it could be made identical to Lomb's least-squares formula for fitting individual sinusoid frequencies. Scargle states that his paper \\"does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced,\\" and further points out in reference to least-squares fitting of sinusoids compared to periodogram analysis, that his paper \\"establishes, apparently for the first time, that (with the proposed modifications) these two methods are exactly equivalent.\\" Press summarizes the development this way: Michael Korenberg of Queen's University in 1989 developed the \\"fast orthogonal search\\" method of more quickly finding a near- optimal decomposition of spectra or other problems, similar to the technique that later became known as orthogonal matching pursuit. In 1994, Scott Chen and David Donoho of Stanford University have developed the \\"basis pursuit\\" method using minimization of the L1 norm of coefficients to cast the problem as a linear programming problem, for which efficient solutions are available. The Van√≠ƒçek method In the Van√≠ƒçek method, a discrete data set is approximated by a weighted sum of sinusoids of progressively determined frequencies, using a standard linear regression, or least-squares fit.Wells, D.E., P. Van√≠ƒçek, S. Pagiatakis, 1985. Least-squares spectral analysis revisited. Department of Surveying Engineering Technical Report 84, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, 68 pages, Available at . The frequencies are chosen using a method similar to Barning's, but going further in optimizing the choice of each successive new frequency by picking the frequency that minimizes the residual after least-squares fitting (equivalent to the fitting technique now known as matching pursuit with pre-backfitting). The number of sinusoids must be less than or equal to the number of data samples (counting sines and cosines of the same frequency as separate sinusoids). A data vector Œ¶ is represented as a weighted sum of sinusoidal basis functions, tabulated in a matrix A by evaluating each function at the sample times, with weight vector x: :\\\\phi \\\\approx \\\\textbf{A}x where the weight vector x is chosen to minimize the sum of squared errors in approximating Œ¶. The solution for x is closed- form, using standard linear regression: :x = (\\\\textbf{A}^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\textbf{A})^{-1}\\\\textbf{A}^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\phi. Here the matrix A can be based on any set of functions that are mutually independent (not necessarily orthogonal) when evaluated at the sample times; for spectral analysis, the functions used are typically sines and cosines evenly distributed over the frequency range of interest. If too many frequencies are chosen in a too-narrow frequency range, the functions will not be sufficiently independent, the matrix will be badly conditioned, and the resulting spectrum will not be meaningful. When the basis functions in A are orthogonal (that is, not correlated, meaning the columns have zero pair-wise dot products), the matrix ATA is a diagonal matrix; when the columns all have the same power (sum of squares of elements), then that matrix is an identity matrix times a constant, so the inversion is trivial. The latter is the case when the sample times are equally spaced and the sinusoids are chosen to be sines and cosines equally spaced in pairs on the frequency interval 0 to a half cycle per sample (spaced by 1/N cycle per sample, omitting the sine phases at 0 and maximum frequency where they are identically zero). This particular case is known as the discrete Fourier transform, slightly rewritten in terms of real data and coefficients. :x = \\\\textbf{A}^{\\\\mathrm{T}}\\\\phi (DFT case for N equally spaced samples and frequencies, within a scalar factor) Lomb proposed using this simplification in general, except for pair-wise correlations between sine and cosine bases of the same frequency, since the correlations between pairs of sinusoids are often small, at least when they are not too closely spaced. This is essentially the traditional periodogram formulation, but now adopted for use with unevenly spaced samples. The vector x is a good estimate of an underlying spectrum, but since correlations are ignored, Ax is no longer a good approximation to the signal, and the method is no longer a least-squares method ‚Äì yet it has continued to be referred to as such. The Lomb‚ÄìScargle periodogram Rather than just taking dot products of the data with sine and cosine waveforms directly, Scargle modified the standard periodogram formula to first find a time delay œÑ such that this pair of sinusoids would be mutually orthogonal at sample times tj, and also adjusted for the potentially unequal powers of these two basis functions, to obtain a better estimate of the power at a frequency, which made his modified periodogram method exactly equivalent to Lomb's least-squares method. The time delay œÑ is defined by the formula :\\\\tan{2 \\\\omega \\\\tau} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_j \\\\sin 2 \\\\omega t_j}{\\\\sum_j \\\\cos 2 \\\\omega t_j}. The periodogram at frequency œâ is then estimated as: :P_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac { \\\\left[ \\\\sum_j X_j \\\\cos \\\\omega ( t_j - \\\\tau ) \\\\right] ^ 2} { \\\\sum_j \\\\cos^2 \\\\omega ( t_j - \\\\tau ) } \\\\+ \\\\frac {\\\\left[ \\\\sum_j X_j \\\\sin \\\\omega ( t_j - \\\\tau ) \\\\right] ^ 2} { \\\\sum_j \\\\sin^2 \\\\omega ( t_j - \\\\tau ) } \\\\right) which Scargle reports then has the same statistical distribution as the periodogram in the evenly sampled case. At any individual frequency œâ, this method gives the same power as does a least-squares fit to sinusoids of that frequency, of the form :\\\\phi(t) = A \\\\sin \\\\omega t + B \\\\cos \\\\omega t. The generalized Lomb‚ÄìScargle periodogram The standard Lomb‚ÄìScargle periodogram is valid for a model with zero mean. Commonly, this is approximated by subtracting the mean of the data before calculating the periodogram. However, this is an inaccurate assumption when the mean of the model (the fitted sinusoids) is non-zero. The generalized Lomb‚ÄìScargle periodogram removes this assumption, and explicitly solves for the mean. In this case, the function fitted is :\\\\phi(t) = A \\\\sin \\\\omega t + B \\\\cos \\\\omega t + C. The generalized Lomb‚ÄìScargle periodogram has also been referred to as a floating mean periodogram. Korenberg's \\"fast orthogonal search\\" method Michael Korenberg of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, developed a method for choosing a sparse set of components from an over-complete set, such as sinusoidal components for spectral analysis, called fast orthogonal search (FOS). Mathematically, FOS uses a slightly modified Cholesky decomposition in a mean-square error reduction (MSER) process, implemented as a sparse matrix inversion. As with the other LSSA methods, FOS avoids the major shortcoming of discrete Fourier analysis, and can achieve highly accurate identifications of embedded periodicities and excels with unequally spaced data; the fast orthogonal search method has also been applied to other problems such as nonlinear system identification. Chen and Donoho's \\"basis pursuit\\" method Chen and Donoho have developed a procedure called basis pursuit for fitting a sparse set of sinusoids or other functions from an over-complete set. The method defines an optimal solution as the one that minimizes the L1 norm of the coefficients, so that the problem can be cast as a linear programming problem, for which efficient solution methods are available.S. Chen and D.L. Donoho (1994), \\"Basis Pursuit.\\" Technical Report, Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Available at Palmer's Chi-squared method Palmer has developed a method for finding the best-fit function to any chosen number of harmonics, allowing more freedom to find non-sinusoidal harmonic functions. This method is a fast technique (FFT-based) for doing weighted least-squares analysis on arbitrarily spaced data with non-uniform standard errors. Source code that implements this technique is available. Because data are often not sampled at uniformly spaced discrete times, this method \\"grids\\" the data by sparsely filling a time series array at the sample times. All intervening grid points receive zero statistical weight, equivalent to having infinite error bars at times between samples. Applications The most useful feature of the LSSA method is enabling incomplete records to be spectrally analyzed, without the need to manipulate the record or to invent otherwise non-existent data. Magnitudes in the LSSA spectrum depict the contribution of a frequency or period to the variance of the time series. Generally, spectral magnitudes defined in the above manner enable the output's straightforward significance level regime.Beard, A.G., Williams, P.J.S., Mitchell, N.J. & Muller, H.G. A special climatology of planetary waves and tidal variability, J Atm. Solar- Ter. Phys. 63 (09), p.801‚Äì811 (2001). Alternatively, magnitudes in the Van√≠ƒçek spectrum can also be expressed in dB.Pagiatakis, S. Stochastic significance of peaks in the least-squares spectrum, J of Geodesy 73, p.67-78 (1999). Note that magnitudes in the Van√≠ƒçek spectrum follow Œ≤-distribution.Steeves, R.R. A statistical test for significance of peaks in the least squares spectrum, Collected Papers of the Geodetic Survey, Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, Surveys and Mapping, Ottawa, Canada, p.149-166 (1981) Inverse transformation of Van√≠ƒçek's LSSA is possible, as is most easily seen by writing the forward transform as a matrix; the matrix inverse (when the matrix is not singular) or pseudo-inverse will then be an inverse transformation; the inverse will exactly match the original data if the chosen sinusoids are mutually independent at the sample points and their number is equal to the number of data points.Craymer, M.R., The Least Squares Spectrum, Its Inverse Transform and Autocorrelation Function: Theory and Some Applications in Geodesy, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Toronto, Canada (1998). No such inverse procedure is known for the periodogram method. Implementation The LSSA can be implemented in less than a page of MATLAB code. In essence: > \\"to compute the least-squares spectrum we must compute m spectral values ... > which involves performing the least-squares approximation m times, each time > to get [the spectral power] for a different frequency\\" I.e., for each frequency in a desired set of frequencies, sine and cosine functions are evaluated at the times corresponding to the data samples, and dot products of the data vector with the sinusoid vectors are taken and appropriately normalized; following the method known as Lomb/Scargle periodogram, a time shift is calculated for each frequency to orthogonalize the sine and cosine components before the dot product, as described by Craymer; finally, a power is computed from those two amplitude components. This same process implements a discrete Fourier transform when the data are uniformly spaced in time and the frequencies chosen correspond to integer numbers of cycles over the finite data record. This method treats each sinusoidal component independently, or out of context, even though they may not be orthogonal on the data points; it is Van√≠ƒçek's original method. In contrast, as Craymer explains, it is also possible to perform a full simultaneous or in-context least-squares fit by solving a matrix equation, partitioning the total data variance between the specified sinusoid frequencies. Such a matrix least-squares solution is natively available in MATLAB as the backslash operator. Craymer explains that the simultaneous or in-context method, as opposed to the independent or out-of-context version (as well as the periodogram version due to Lomb), cannot fit more components (sines and cosines) than there are data samples, and further that: Lomb's periodogram method, on the other hand, can use an arbitrarily high number of, or density of, frequency components, as in a standard periodogram; that is, the frequency domain can be over-sampled by an arbitrary factor. In Fourier analysis, such as the Fourier transform or the discrete Fourier transform, the sinusoids being fitted to the data are all mutually orthogonal, so there is no distinction between the simple out-of-context dot-product-based projection onto basis functions versus an in-context simultaneous least-squares fit; that is, no matrix inversion is required to least-squares partition the variance between orthogonal sinusoids of different frequencies. This method is usually preferred for its efficient fast Fourier transform implementation, when complete data records with equally spaced samples are available.

Biography Bryan Thomas Mahon was born at Belleville, County Galway on 2 April 1862. He became a lieutenant in the 8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars in 1883. He served in Sudan in the Dongola Expedition in 1896 as Staff officer to Sir Herbert Kitchener, and was present at the Battle of Ferkeh and the operations at Hafir. In 1899, he took part in the final defeat of the Khalifa as Assistant Adjutant general in charge of Intelligence, and was mentioned in despatches (dated 25 November 1899) by Colonel Wingate with the following words: > I cannot speak in sufficiently strong terms of the excellence of the > services performed by this officer. I invariably placed him in general > command of all the mounted troops; his personal disregard for danger, > intrepid scouting, and careful handling of men, all fit him for high > command; his bold and successful seizure of the position in front of Fedil's > camp, and his conduct of the fight before I came up, show him to possessed > of exceptional qualities as a commander. In recognition of his service in the Sudan, he received the brevet promotion to colonel on 14 March 1900. During the Second Boer War Colonel Mahon led a flying column 2,000 strong, consisting mainly of South African volunteers from Kimberley, which came to the Relief of Mafeking. The town, which had been under siege for seven months by Boer forces, was facing starvation. Mahon was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) for his services during the operations, and was invested with the order by King Edward VII on 2 June 1902 after his return to the United Kingdom. Mahon was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in May 1902, and was briefly Governor of Khartoum in 1903. Bryan Mahon at Salonica 1916 During the First World War he commanded the 2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade and the 10th (Irish) Division during the Gallipoli Campaign. The 10th Division landed at Suvla Bay on the night of 6‚Äì7 August 1915. In September he moved with the Division to be head of the British Salonika Army to support Serbia at the onset of the Macedonian campaign. In 1916 General Mahon took up command of the Western Frontier Force in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. He was then appointed as the Commander- in-Chief, Ireland in 1916 in the lead up to the Anglo-Irish War. He retired from the British Army at the end of August 1921. After his retirement he was elected as a privy council member of the short-lived Senate of Southern Ireland. He was appointed to Seanad √âireann by the President of the Executive Council, W. T. Cosgrave, in 1922 and 1925. His home, Mullaboden in Ballymore- Eustace, County Kildare was burned down by the IRA in February 1923 during the Irish Civil War. The most valuable furniture had been removed to Dublin after the destruction of Palmerstown, the residence of Lord Mayo, another Kildare member of the Irish Senate, the previous month. A gramophone and typewriter were stolen and one of Mahon's tunics was taken and worn by one of the republicans for a photo taken of the squad that carried out the arson. He and his wife, Lady Mahon, formerly Lady Milbanke, widow of Sir John Milbanke, V.C. were not home at the time. In 1923, \\"malicious injury claims\\" by the Mahons were filed with Kildare County Council in the amount of more than ¬£60,000; they were awarded ¬£21,341.

History  The Lopez Museum was founded on 13 February 1960 by Eugenio Lopez, Sr in honor of his parents, Benito Lopez and Presentacion Hofile√±a. Eugenio Lopez built the museum to provide scholars and students access to his personal collection of rare Filipiniana books, manuscripts, maps, archaeological artifacts and fine art. Eugenio Lopez is known to many as a leading industrialist of post- World War II Philippines. With resources that came from sugar production, he pioneered in diverse fields of business including transportation (bus, taxicab and air transport operations), mass media (ABS-CBN Corporation and The Manila Chronicle), energy (MERALCO) becoming one of the first Filipino successes in business in a then largely American dominated economy. A staunch nationalist, Eugenio Lopez believed that by preserving and promoting the Filipino heritage, his country men would eventually develop sense of national pride and enable the country to develop a unified spirit ultimately resulting in ensuring a strengthening of a collective national soul in the succeeding generations. He died in July 1975 in San Francisco, California, United States, where he had lived in self-imposed exile since 1972, away from the oppression of martial law. He had led a full life as a leading industrialist and a media magnate, leaving behind him a legacy for the Filipino people.  The art collection  As is the story for most museums built from a core of personal acquisitions, the Lopez Museum collection is an amalgam of objects reflecting the overt as well as latent idiosyncrasies of each of its curators and directors. Apart from constituting a seminal contribution to extant Philippine heritage, the Lopez Museum collection stands as one of the oldest, publicly accessible private art collections in the country. Eminent historian Renato Constantino was Lopez Museum's first curator, from 1960 to 1972. Engaged by LMM founder and prominent antiquarian Eugenio Lopez, Sr (E√±ing), it was only logical that it would be under his watch that the museum acquired Juan Luna's Espa√±a y Filipinas, a seminal work much cited for capturing the image of a country patronizingly led up the rungs of evolutionary colonial tutelage. Such acquisitions complemented the Philippine rare books and antiquarian map collection amassed by E√±ing, who in consultation with renowned collector and connoisseur Alfonso Ongpin, further acquired other seminal and technically astute works by Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, and Fernando Amorsolo. A second key acquisition phase was led by E√±ing's youngest son, Roberto Lopez who was inclined toward Philippine Modernism, thus improving this aspect of the LMM collection with works vetted under the supervision of art historian, Rod Paras Perez. An even more pronounced and art historically-sensitive acquisition program was adopted under the term of Eugenio Lopez, Jr who was at the helm of LMM from 1993 to 1999. Lopez, Jr worked alongside a sharp professional complement made up of Mariles Ebro Matias, Joselina Cruz, and Maita Reyes who collaboratively elevated LMM's museum education, curatorial, and conservation programs unto previously unreached heights. It was during these successive phases that key works of national artists (Carlos Francisco, Napoleon Abueva, Hernando Ocampo, Vicente Manansala, Cesar Legaspi, Victorio Edades, Jeremias Elizalde Navarro, Arturo Luz, Jose Joya, Ang Kiukok, Benedicto Cabrera) as well as the works of younger, emergent voices further layered the discursive potential of LMM's visual art trove. The current leadership, under Oscar Lopez and Director Mercedes Vargas, intends to keep its library and art collection holdings current and significant, while keeping abreast with international museum standards relevant to contemporary exhibition discourse, heritage conservation, extension, and outreach. Expectedly, the character of the Lopez Museum collection has cumulatively morphed with the institution's shifting concerns. Presently, one of the major challenges confronting LMM is the need to continually showcase segments of its permanent collection alongside contemporary Filipino creative expression couched within the frames of increasing interdisciplinarity and merging communication platforms. It is in this light that curation brings the possibility of infusing context and sub-text to an otherwise private quest for personal roots and a shared locus for nationalist heritage.  The library collection: 600 years of history  Consisting of over 19,000 Filipiniana titles by about 12,000 authors, the Lopez Library houses an invaluable collection of Philippine incunabula, rare books, manuscripts, dictionaries, literary works in Western and vernacular languages, religious tracts, periodicals, newspapers, coffee table volumes, academic treatises, contemporary writing, maps, archival photographs, cartoons and microfilms. It remains a critical node in the small network of institutions devoted to ongoing Philippine scholarship produced locally and internationally. Among its more important holdings are 21 rare titles of Philippine imprints dated from 1597 to 1800, 69 key titles from the 18th century, and 777 titles from the 19th century. The library's rare books and manuscripts include those of eminent printers, Tomas Pinpin, Raymundo Magysa, Nicolas Bagay, Laureano Atlas, and Juan Correa. The library is home to the first edition of Belarmin- Lopez's Doctrina Cristiana (Manila 1620) translated into Ilocano (Libro a naisuratan amin ti bagas), Pedro Chirino's Relacion de las Islas Filipinas, as well as key editions of Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas (Jose Rizal's 1890 edition, Blair and Robertson's 1904 edition, and W. E. Retana's 1909 edition). In addition to a huge aggregate of secondary works on the National Hero, Dr Jose Rizal authored by both Filipino and Western authors, the Lopez Library also serves as steward to 93 of Rizal's letters to his parents, sisters, brother and brothers-in-law, among other objects which constitute the most priceless items in LMM's Rizaliana collection. Among other items worthy of note are a variety of dictionaries, grammar books, and LMM's collection of devotional literature: sermons, novenas, accounts of the lives of saints that were used as tools in the propagation of Roman Catholicism during the Spanish colonial period. Equally important and indispensable are such primary sources as the manuscripts and personal papers of individuals such as Pablo Pastells, Gaspar de San Agust√≠n, Eulogio Despujol, H. L. Legarda, Manuel Sastron y Pi√±ol, and Justo Zaragosa. Microfilm copies of the Philippine Revolutionary papers, commonly known as the Philippine Insurgent Records, American Consular Reports (1817‚Äì1898) from the National Archives, Washington, DC, United States. and several reels of the British Consular Reports, circa 1844‚Äì1898, together with the H. H. Bartlett collection from the American Philosophical Society Library, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, are among the significant additions to the library's growing microfilm collection which also includes the Tribune (1925‚Äì1945), Manila Chronicle (1945‚Äì1972), Harpers Weekly, and other key periodicals which are already accessible through digitized versions. LMM's deep archive of photographs includes a substantial collection of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, early years of the American regime, the Commonwealth era, the post-independence period, up to Martial Law.

De Leon, represented by Narcisa L. Escaler and Nieva Paz L. Era√±a. LVN's name was coined, in 1938, from the first letters of the owners‚Äô names: De Leon, Carmen Villongco and Eleuterio Navoa Jr. De Leon, known as Do√±a Sisang who became president after buying out the inactive partner-families. abs-cbnnews.com, Rare LVN memorabilia find a home in Lopez Museum  Digitization project: Preserving the library collections  One of two parallel and collaborative programs (the other being Conservation) that is envisioned to preserve and promote the Library collection, the Digitization Project aims to accomplish the following: * capture, catalogue and store images of original materials * make these images searchable/accessible/retrievable for a greater range of users * protect and preserve the originals by reducing handling, and * contribute to making the operation of the Library cost-efficient  Exhibition program  Since its inception in the 1960s, the Lopez Museum has primarily been identified as a key viewing venue for important works by Spanish colonial period painters Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo. However, with the museum's transition to Pasig and a deliberate shift to more dynamic acquisition and exhibition programs, LMM spatially reconfigured its galleries and adjunct exhibition spaces to showcase key objects from the permanent collection alongside other newer, acquired pieces such as those by national artists Francisco, Manansala, Ocampo, Legaspi, Edades, Luz, et al. and commissioned installations and contemporary artifacts such as films, TV clips, video, and other multimedia work. Beginning in 2001, LMM instilled a semi-annual changing exhibit program in an effort to practice prudent resource use as well as infuse its exhibitions with a less-static character. This tactical shift sought to balance attention to interpreting segments of the permanent collection alongside exploring intersections in contemporary as well as pop-inflected artistic expression through curatorial intervention and the instigation of artists‚Äô projects. LMM's exhibitions have included: * Fixation: Notions of Obsession brought a selection of LMM's pieces in conversation with the object troves and installations of Raymond Red, Alfredo and Isabel Aquilizan, Ikoy Ricio, and Alice & Lucinda; * Projections: Maps, directions & sites, distortions, charts, detours, rumblings & ramblings, a seminal examination of the LMM map collection amidst territorial investigations in the works of Lordy Rodriguez, Mafe Baluyos, Erwin Lea√±o, and Lena Cobangbang; * Grave Findings: A Reclamation Project allowed Maria Taniguchi to mimic and re-stage the excavations done in Calatagan, Batangas the site from which pre-colonial funerary furniture now ensconced in the LMM collection was originally drawn; * Juan Arellano: Drawing Space was a modest survey of paintings and drawings by the renowned American colonial period architect and re-invested with a contemporary re-reading in a multimedia installation by Datu Arellano; * Babble, Bauble: Tweaking Femme was a visual attempt to look at female representation in images from LMM's art collection, contemporary film and television; and he concluded Fuzzy Logic: Art and Technology, which was an examination of the ambivalent relationships of thread art and science in the cross-generational practice of Kidlat Tahimik, Santiago Bose, Charlie Co, Yason Banal, Louie Cordero, Alfred Villaruel, Wire Tuazon, among others as juxtaposed against LMM pieces by Navarro, Roberto Chabet, Ray Albano, Galo and Hernando Ocampo, Alfonso A. Ossorio, etc. This current exhibition tract has thus far allowed the museum to attempt at tentative but less canonical and perhaps necessary re-consideration of the bodies of work of artists it has had a hand in validating through its collections. It has likewise created opportunities for LMM to interrogate its own museological track amidst the parallel practices of other institutions it works alongside with or to which it serves as de facto counterpoints to. * The Sum of its Parts shows its heritage of unique expertise in conservation and acquisition in the collections or works by Hidalgo, Luna, Pacita Abad, Nena Saguil, Juvenal Sanso, Claudio Bravo, and contemporary artist Jonathan Olazo's installation work (taking off from his father, Romulo Olazo, known for his 1960s \\"Diaphanous Series\\": graphic art medium of printmaking).abs-cbnnews.com, Lopez Memorial Museum showcases \\"The Sum of Its Parts\\" * Keeping the Faith: Acts of Mediation featured contemporary artist Kiri Dalena, filmmakers Egay Navarro and Rica Concepcion, and sculptor Agnes Arellano showed their works respectively, alongside works of 19th century masters Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, national artists Vicente Manansala, J Elizalde Navarro, Benedicto Cabrera, and artists such as Jose Tence Ruiz and Danilo Dalena. Dalena's installation \\"Barricade, book of slogans, erased slogans, and isolation room\\" referenced images from the Lopez library archive of materials from the martial law period. The show also presents Navarro and Concepcion's documentary on the late Baguio artist Roberto Villanueva as well as Arellano's sculptural work \\"Angel of Death and Bronze Bullets.\\" Curated by husband and wife team of Claro and Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez, the exhibit explores the notions of access across the registers of time and place. Eileen said, \\"As you come and see this exhibition, you would come away with a sense of how we've tried to negotiate the Bridges theme in terms of how, as human beings, we constantly have to deal with being made to stay put or move on literally and metaphorically ... Every exhibition here at Lopez opens up to us the privilege of engaging with contemporary artists who we strongly feel can bring into the museum new ideas and voices that challenge us to re-think and re-evaluate our intentions and museological practices.\\" The exhibit was part of the annual project Zero In, undertaken by a consortium of private museums composed of Ateneo Art Gallery, Ayala Museum, Bahay Tsinoy, Lopez Museum and Museo Pambata.  Education and publications programs  Apart from tending to its intrinsic stewardship function as a heritage institution, Lopez Museum has also consistently been proactive in the area of audience development. Thus, the museum has also been the site of a wide diversity of workshop offerings and thought-provoking public talks and roundtable conversations carried out alongside its archival and exhibition services. Over the past six years, LMM has invited exhibiting artists, critics, curators, cultural workers, as well as other cross-disciplinary academics and scholars to engage with the museum's menu of curatorial and outreach talking points which touch on a range encompassing psychology, sociology, political science, anthropology, the natural and physical sciences, to more emergent fields of discourse such as new media studies and pop culture. These events have allowed museum visitors and researchers to encounter first-hand such individuals as Ambeth Ocampo, Benedicto Cabrera, Cid Reyes, Patrick Flores, Kidlat Tahimik, among many others. Students and lovers of geography, history, politics, art and education will delight in Lopez Memorial Museum's exhibits showcasing rare maps in one and school texts in the other. Maps are not just physical but charged political delimitations of territory in the exhibit Tutelage at the Library. The exhibit Double Take at the main gallery, features works from the museum's permanent collection, LVN archival photographs and a video installation by featured artist, director Raya Martin. Also as an explicit demonstration of its commitment to scholarship are the slew of publications that have seen print under LMM's initiative. These include: The Philippine Insurrection Against the US edited by Renato Constantino, Juan Luna: The Filipino Painter by Santiago A. Pilar, Orchidiana Philippiniana by Helen Valmayor, Philippine Rariora by Mauro Garcia, Manansala Nudes and Fernando Zobel by Rod Paras- Perez. Its most recent releases are Locus: Interventions in Art Practice (co- published through the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and Pananaw ng Sining Bayan, Inc.) and LMM's contribution to the Philippine Centennial, Hidalgo and the Generation of 1872 by Alfredo Roces. Throughout the years, LMM has also hosted continuing education classes in allied disciplines such as creative writing, book binding, book repair, drawing, cartooning, textile crafts among others. Several workshops catering to the museum professional have also been given and this include disaster preparedness and docent trainings  Institutional collaborations  With the aim of further broadening its audience reach and deepening its network partnerships, Lopez Museum has helped initiate a consortium of cultural institutions called Zero- in (with the Ayala Museum, and the Ateneo Art Gallery as original members). Since expanding to include Museo Pambata and Bahay Tsinoy, the Zero-in consortium has come together annually to mount a multi-venue series of exhibitions that allow these institutions to explore avenues for potential synergy vis√†-vis their collections and interesting technical expertise. Now into its sixth year, Zero-in has launched outreach programs to public school teachers and students, and facilitated ongoing and past loans and projects among its member institutions. Lopez Museum has also partnered up in varying degrees with such institutions as the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, Japan Foundation, Casa Asia, the Museum Foundation of the Philippines, Metrobank Foundation, Prince Klaus Foundation, and CollAsia 2010.  The future: New media  Any learning institution in this age of information overloading faces the daunting task of keeping a largely distracted audience keyed into how the past and present converge, that is, without getting pulled into all sorts of unsustainable tracts. Now practically half-a-century old, the Lopez Museum finds itself precisely at that precarious perch, of having to run a tight ship amidst a rapidly changing communications technology landscape. Lopez Museum ‚Äúis a very traditional institution, but what I wanted to do was to explore ways to use new media and more visual learning. I also wanted to make the Museum more visible in all our network‚Äôs platforms‚ÄîTV, radio and glossies (magazines)‚Äù, Director Vargas relates. The Museum under Vargas is keenly aware of its need to engage its target publics not only in terms of developing critical reader-visitors but in making museums a more likely destination among those seeking time-worthy pursuits. She elaborates: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not a museum-going public. People are more concerned with survival, with basic needs. The sad part is that the Filipino is so artistic‚Äîwe have such a rich and varied culture but it does not take precedence because (so many) are below the poverty level. So, one of my goals is to promote museum awareness among the younger generation.‚Äù As it passes into another half- century of further nurturing a new contingent of driven museum workers and crafters of culture, Lopez Museum looks forward to how it can dynamically play a role in taking stock of past and current intellectual production and giving this back to those who can make best sense of it in the everyday life of the present Filipino.

It is located north of San Pablo Bay. The proximity to the cool fog and breezes from the bay makes the climate in Los Carneros cooler and more moderate than the wine regions farther north in Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley. The cooler climate has made Los Carneros attractive for the cultivation of cooler climate varietals like Pinot noir and Chardonnay. Many of the grapes grown in Los Carneros are used for sparkling wine production. Receiving its AVA status in 1983, the Carneros area was the first wine region in California to be defined by its climate characteristics rather than political boundaries.A. Goldfarb \\"Carneros AVA -- The Sweet Spot for Pinot noir and Chardonnay\\" Appellation America, September 28th 2007 The default Windows XP \\"Bliss\\" background image was photographed here, a few years after the vineyards had been removed following a phylloxera infestation; they were replanted later, making the place unrecognizable as the Windows XP background. Early morning fog over a block of Chardonnay on the Napa side of the Los Carneros AVA History In the year 1942, wine producer Louis M. Martini purchased the old Stanly Ranch and began a replanting effort. By the 1970s, the Carneros region had more than of vineyards. By this time the Carneros region was starting to develop a reputation for the quality of the Chardonnays and Pinot noirs that came from this cool-climate region. This reputation caught the eyes of sparkling wine producers from Champagne and elsewhere. In the 1970s and continuing to this day, Francis Mahoney of Mahoney Vineyards and Fleur de California in conjunction with UC-Davis have conducted an ongoing series of clonal trials to determine the best Pinot noir grapes for the Carneros region. The 1980s saw a wave of investment and development in Los Carneros by producers such as Domaine Chandon, Domaine Carneros, Gloria Ferrer, Mumm Napa and Codorn√≠u Napa that made Carneros one of the centers of California sparkling wine production.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 140-141 Oxford University Press 2006 In the late 1980s, phylloxera returned to the Carneros region prompting extensive replanting efforts. In addition to taking advantage of better phylloxera- resistant rootstock, many Carneros producers also took the opportunity to plant some of the new French clones of Pinot noir and Chardonnay.D. Berger \\"Los Carneros Pinot noir: a regional signature becomes illegible as winemakers seek a new identity\\" Appellation America, Feb. 12th 2006 The surging popularity of Chardonnay in the 1980s further stimulated plantings in the Carneros region. By the early 1990s, the region had over planted.J. Laube \\"What Lies Ahead for Carneros?\\" Wine Spectator, May 15th, 1994 Geography and climate Approximate location of the Carneros AVA (red box) in relation to San Pablo Bay. The Carneros region covers located along the low-lying hills of the Mayacamas range as it descends underneath San Francisco Bay. Elevations of most vineyards range from in the foothills to near sea level closer to the bay. The official boundaries of the AVA fall into both Napa and Sonoma counties with the largest portion being in Sonoma and entitled to use the Sonoma Valley AVA designation as well. The Napa portion of Los Carneros is similarly entitled to use the Napa Valley AVA designation. The region is moderately cool and windy with marked influences from nearby San Pablo Bay, making it the coolest and windiest AVA in both Napa & Sonoma. Early morning fog is a persistent feature. =Viticulture= The soils of the Carneros region are predominantly clay and very thin and shallow (approximately 3 feet/1 meter deep), providing poor drainage and fertility. The fierce and persistent winds coming off the bay encourages the grapevines to struggle and retain moisture. While this aids in keeping crop yields small, it can also delay the grapes from ripening sufficiently. In vintages with a long, drawn out growing season that allow the grapes to ripen, intense and vivid flavors can develop. Grape varieties and wine A Chardonnay from the Carneros AVA. Los Carneros is primarily associated with the cool-climate wines such as Chardonnay and Pinot noir, as well as the sparkling wines made from those grapes. Many wineries in Napa & Sonoma use Carneros grapes as a cool-climate blending component. In recent years there has been interest in Merlot and Syrah coming from the warmer areas of the region. In 1996, the first possible plantings of Albarino in the United States were planted in the Carneros region.D. Sogg \\"California Vintner Brings Iberian Grape to Carneros \\" Wine Spectator, April 6th 2002 Carneros Chardonnay is marked by its high acidity that can bring balance to the fatter, rounder Chardonnays produced in the warmer climate areas of Sonoma and Napa. While in the past, chardonnay was usually put through malolactic fermentation and was given significant oak treatment to soften some of the acidity, the current winemaking style in California emphasizes the fruit. The style now favors stainless steel and neutral French Oak, while rarely using more than a portion of the wine undergoing malolactic fermentation. Pinot noir from the Carneros is known for its crisp acidity and tight structure and frequently exhibits spicy berry fruit. The Carneros region was one of the early pioneers of cool-climate Pinot noirs in California-long before it became a significant planting in the Russian River, Anderson Valley, Santa Rita Hills and Santa Lucia Highlands AVAs. In recent years there has been a focus by Carneros Pinot noir producers on the changing style of the region's Pinot due, in part, on emerging modern philosophies in winemaking and on clonal selections. The older clones found in Carneros include the Martini and Swan clones which produce wines that are lighter, more elegant with some earthy complexity. They are also noted for their distinctive aromas of green herbs, beets and mint. The newer French clones being planted, (such as the Dijon 115, 667 and 777) produce more alcoholic and concentrated wines with black fruit notes.D. Berger \\"Striking a balance as old style and new co-exist in Carneros Pinot noir\\" Appellation America, Accessed: January 13th 2009 Light brown apple moth sightings In August 2008, two light brown apple moths were discovered in the Carneros region close to the Napa County line.L. Alley \\"Carneros Faces Impending Quarantine\\" Wine Spectator, August 22nd 2008 The pests lay eggs on grape leaves and the resulting larvae feed on the leaves and fruit clusters, leaving them prone to rot. Thus, their discovery caused concern that parts of the Carneros region may be quarantined just before the busy harvest season. Proposals on how to deal with the vineyard pest have been met with controversy in the past.L.

It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010) and Fraser Island, Australia (2019). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses. The fruit bodies typically have a funnel-shaped cap with a white edge, although the shape can be highly variable. Young, moist fruit bodies can \\"bleed\\" bright red guttation droplets that contain a pigment known to have anticoagulant properties similar to heparin. The unusual appearance of the young fruit bodies has earned the species several descriptive common names, including strawberries and cream, the bleeding Hydnellum, the bleeding tooth fungus, the red-juice tooth, and the Devil's tooth. Although Hydnellum peckii fruit bodies are readily identifiable when young, they become brown and nondescript when they age. Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming The species was first described scientifically by American mycologist Howard James Banker in 1913. Italian Pier Andrea Saccardo placed the species in the genus Hydnum in 1925, while Walter Henry Snell and Esther Amelia Dick placed it in Calodon in 1956; Hydnum peckii (Banker) Sacc. and Calodon peckii Snell & E.A. Dick are synonyms of Hydnellum peckii. The fungus is classified in the stirps (species thought to be descendants of a common ancestor) Diabolum of the genus Hydnellum, a grouping of similar species with the following shared characteristics: flesh that is marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones (zonate); an extremely peppery taste; a sweetish odor; spores that are ellipsoid, and not amyloid (that is, not absorbing iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), acyanophilous (not staining with the reagent Cotton Blue), and covered with tubercules; the presence of clamp connections in the hyphae. Molecular analysis based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer DNA of several Hydnellum species placed H. peckii as most closely related to H. ferrugineum and H. spongiosipes. It has a brown spore print. The specific eponym honors mycologist Charles Horton Peck. The fungus is known in the vernacular by several names, including \\"strawberries and cream\\", the \\"bleeding Hydnellum\\", the \\"red-juice tooth\\", \\"Peck's hydnum\\", the \\"bleeding tooth fungus\\", and the \\"devil's tooth\\". Description As in all mushroom-producing fungi, the fruit bodies (sporocarps) are the reproductive structures that are produced from fungal mycelium when the appropriate environmental conditions of temperature, humidity and nutrient availability are met. Hydnellum peckii is a stipitate hydnoid fungus, meaning that it has a cap atop a stipe (stem), and a form resembling a Hydnum‚Äîcharacterized by a teeth-like hymenium, rather than gills or pores on the underside of the cap. Fruit bodies growing closely together often appear to fuse together (this is called \\"confluence\\"). They can reach a height of up to . Fresh fruit bodies exude a striking, thick red fluid when they are moist. The \\"teeth\\" covering the cap's underside are specialized structures that produce spores. The cap's surface is convex to flattened, more or less uneven and sometimes slightly depressed in the center. It is usually densely covered with \\"hairs\\" that give it a texture similar to felt or velvet; these hairs are sloughed off in age, leaving the caps of mature specimens smooth. Its shape varies from somewhat round to irregular, , or even as much as wide as a result of confluence. The cap is initially whitish, but later turns slightly brownish, with irregular dark-brown to nearly black blotches where it is bruised. In maturity, the surface is fibrous and tough, scaly and jagged, grayish brown in the upper part of the cap, and somewhat woody. The flesh is a pale pinkish brown. The spines are slender, cylindrical and tapering (terete), less than long, and become shorter closer to the cap edge. They are crowded together, with typically between three and five teeth per square millimeter. Pinkish white initially, they age to a grayish brown. The stem is thick, very short, and often deformed. It becomes bulbous where it penetrates the ground, and may root into the soil for several centimeters. Although it may reach up to in total length, and is wide, only about appear above ground. The upper part is covered with the same teeth found on the underside of the cap, whereas the lower part is hairy and often encases debris from the forest floor. The odor of the fruit body has been described as \\"mild to disagreeable\\", or, as Banker suggested in his original description, similar to hickory nuts. =Microscopic features= In deposit, the spores appear brown. Viewing them with a light microscope reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0‚Äì5.3 by 4.0‚Äì4.7 ¬µm. The spores are inamyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. Hydnellum peckii's cells (the hyphae) also present various characters useful for its characterization. The hyphae that form the cap are hyaline (translucent), smooth, thin-walled, and 3‚Äì4 ¬µm thick. They collapse when dry, but may be readily revived with a weak (2%) solution of potassium hydroxide. Those in the cap form an intricate tangle with a tendency to run longitudinally. They are divided into cellular compartments (septa) and have clamp connections‚Äîshort branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium, are club- shaped, four-spored, and measure 35‚Äì40 by 4.7‚Äì6 ¬µm. =Similar species= Hydnellum diabolus (the species epithet is given the neuter diabolum in some publications) has a very similar appearance, so much so that some consider it and H. peckii to be synonymous; H. diabolus is said to have a sweetish pungent odor that is lacking in H. peckii. The differences between the two species are amplified in mature specimens: H. diabolus has an irregularly thickened stem, while the stem of H. peckii is thickened by a \\"definite spongy layer\\". Additionally, old specimens of H. peckii have a smooth cap, while H. diabolus is tomentose. The related species H. pineticola also exudes pink droplets of liquid when young and moist. Commonly found growing under conifers in northeastern North America, H. pineticola tastes \\"unpleasant\\", but not acrid. Fruit bodies tend to grow singly, rather than in fused clusters, and, unlike H. peckii, they do not have bulbous stems. Ecology Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal fungus, and as such establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of certain trees (referred to as \\"hosts\\"), in which the fungus exchanges minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of a broad range of tree species, in an intimate association that is especially beneficial to the host (termed ectomycorrhizal), as the fungus produces enzymes that mineralize organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. The ectomycorrhizal structures of H. peckii are among a few in the Bankeraceae that have been studied in detail. They are characterized by a plectenchymatous mantle‚Äîa layer of tissue made of hyphae tightly arranged in a parallel orientation, or palisade, and which rarely branch or overlap each other. These hyphae, along with adhering mineral soil particles, are embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The hyphae of the ectomycorrhizae can become chlamydospores, an adaptation that helps the fungus tolerate unfavorable conditions. Chlamydospores of H. peckii have a peculiar structure‚Äîmarkedly distinct from those of other Bankeraceae‚Äîwith thick, smooth inner walls and an outer wall that is split radially into warts. The most striking characteristic of the ectomycorrhizae as a whole is the way the black outer layers of older sections are shed, giving a \\"carbonized appearance\\". The majority of the underground biomass of the fungus is concentrated near the surface, most likely as \\"mycelial mats\\"‚Äîdense clusters of ectomycorrhizae and mycelium. The mycelium is also known to extend far beyond the site of the fruit bodies, as far as away. Molecular techniques have been developed to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including H. peckii. While the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia. Habitat and distribution Fruit bodies can grow solitarily, scattered, or clustered together. Location: Tusby, Finland. The fruit bodies of Hydnellum peckii are found growing solitary, scattered, or clustered together on the ground under conifers, often among mosses and pine needle litter. H. peckii is a \\"late-stage\\" fungus that, in boreal forests dominated by jack pine, typically begins associating with more mature hosts once the canopy has closed. A preference for mountainous or subalpine ecosystems has been noted. The fungus has a wide distribution in North America, and is particularly common in the Pacific Northwest; its range extends north to Alaska and east to North Carolina. In the Puget Sound area of the U.S. state of Washington, it is found in association with Douglas-fir, fir, and hemlock. Along the Oregon Coast it has been collected under lodgepole pine. In addition to North America, the mushroom is widespread in Europe, and its presence has been documented in Italy, Germany, and Scotland. The species is common in the latter location, but becoming increasingly rare in several European countries, such as Norway, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. Increased pollution in central Europe has been suggested as one possible factor in the mushroom's decline there. Reports from Iran in 2008 and Korea in 2010 were the first outside Europe and North America. Uses Although the fruit bodies of H. peckii have been described as resembling \\"Danish pastry topped with strawberry jam\\", and Hydnellum species in general are not known to be poisonous, they are inedible due to their extremely bitter taste. This acridity persists even in dried specimens. The fruit bodies of this and other Hydnellum species are prized by mushroom dyers. The colors may range from beige when no mordant is used, to various shades of blue or green depending on the mordant added. Chemistry Structural formula of atromentin Screening of an extract of Hydnellum peckii revealed the presence of an effective anticoagulant, named atromentin (2,5-dihydroxy-3,6-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-benzoquinone), and similar in biological activity to the well-known anticoagulant heparin. Atromentin also possesses antibacterial activity, inhibiting the enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids) in the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hydnellum peckii can bioaccumulate the heavy metal caesium. In one Swedish field study, as much as 9% of the total caesium of the topmost of soil was found in the fungal mycelium. In general, ectomycorrhizal fungi, which grow most prolifically in the upper organic horizons of the soil or at the interface between the organic and mineral layers, are involved in the retention and cycling of caesium-137 in organic- rich forest soils.

One of the caves at Bakota's ancient cave monastery. History Bakota was first mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle in the year 1240. When the town was first settled, the town was part of the state of Kievan Rus', until the middle of the 12th century when it became a part of the Halych- Volhynian Kingdom. In the 13th century, Bakota served as the political and administrative center of the Dniester Lowland (Ponyzzia), which was at the time part of Halych-Volhynia. The chronicle also mentions the rule of the Koriatovych dynasty over the area in 1362. After being ruled by the Koriatovych dynasty, the town was controlled by Algirdas, a monarch of the medieval Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lithuanian Chronicle of 1362 mentions that a functioning cave monastery exists within the town. This motivated the construction of fortifications, to protect the town from Crimean Tatar raids. In 1431, Bakota was located and shared between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. Bakota's inhabitants later started a revolt and proclaimed their independence, which was crushed by Poland within three years The town's fortifications and castle were also destroyed. In 1893, in place of a formerly standing church, a new wooden one was constructed, founded by the Episcop of Podillia and Bratslav Dmitry.\\"Rock monastery, end of 13-middle 14th c.\\" in \\"Monuments of architecture of Ukrainian SSR,\\" edited by N.

The valley is formed by Dry Creek, a tributary of the Russian River, and is approximately long and wide. The appellation benefits from the proximity of the Lake Sonoma reservoir for irrigation in this relatively dry area.  History  Merlot vines in Dry Creek Valley AVA. At the turn of the 20th century, Dry Creek Valley was one of California's most prominent producers of Zinfandel. During Prohibition, much of the valley was converted to plum, pear, and prune trees, and much of the fruit was processed by Sunsweet Growers in Healdsburg. Since the resurgence of wine grape production in the 1970s, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel have become the most planted varieties, and Dry Creek Valley AVA has become one of the state's top Zinfandel producers. Sauvignon blanc has become the most important white grape varietal produced in the valley.  Wineries  Over 50 wineries are resident in Dry Creek Valley AVA, and over 160 wineries produce wines that bear a Dry Creek Valley AVA designation. Dry Creek Valley AVA is home to the majority of the Sonoma vineyards of E & J Gallo Winery, who established winery facilities in the valley in the early 1990s.

Located at the southwestern corner of the Russian River Valley AVA, its close proximity to the Pacific Ocean makes it one of the coolest appellations within Sonoma County. The climate in the Green Valley is even cooler than other parts of the Russian River Valley, and favors the cultivation of cool climate varietals like Pinot noir, Chardonnay and Gew√ºrztraminer.  History  Green Valley was first designated as a wine region with the name Sonoma County Green Valley AVA on November 21, 1983, a name that was similar in structure to the Solano County Green Valley AVA created in 1982. Many wines that could have been labelled with the Sonoma County Green Valley AVA designation were instead labelled with the broader appellation designation of the Russian River Valley AVA, due to the greater market awareness of Russian River Valley wines. A group of wine producers from the region petitioned the United States Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for a name change to associate the Green Valley with the more popular Russian River Valley. The name of the appellation was changed with an amendment to the federal law designating American Viticultural Areas, effective April 23, 2007, to be the Green Valley of Russian River Valley AVA.

Geography ≈öwierklaniec lies approximately east of Tarnowskie G√≥ry and north of the regional capital Katowice, in the historic Upper Silesia region. In the east of the municipal area, the Brynica River, a tributary of the Black Przemsza, marks the border of Silesia with Lesser Poland. 43% of the ≈öwierklaniec gmina in which the village is located is covered with forests. Palaces and gardens of ≈öwierklaniec ≈öwierklaniec was famous for its palace (, German: Schloss Neudeck), a former residence of the Henckel von Donnersmarck noble family, when the vast and brilliantly designed castle complex was commonly known as Upper Silesian Versailles. Both the Old and the New Castle of ≈öwierklaniec were set ablaze by the Red Army in 1945 and demolished in 1961. The extended castle grounds, the Cavalier Palace guest house, the Donnersmarck funerary chapel and several auxiliary buildings are preserved. =Old Castle= Old Castle, about 1900 A first fortress near the strategically important Brynica River on the road from Bytom to Czƒôstochowa was erected in the 11th century at the behest of the Polish king Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry. In 1179 High Duke Casimir II the Just gave it to the Racib√≥rz duke Mieszko IV Tanglefoot. After the Racib√≥rz line of the Silesian Piasts had become extinct in 1336, ≈öwierklaniec passed to the Dukes of Teschen and the castle was largely rebuilt under the rule of Duke Konrad II the Gray of Oels. In 1477 the Swiklenczy border fortress was mentioned as part of the Silesian Duchy of Bytom. It was acquired by Duke Jan II the Good of Opole in 1498, who again rebuilt it in a Brick Gothic style. In 1526 however he had to give it in pawn, and upon his death in 1532, the premises fell to Margrave George of Brandenburg-Ansbach from the House of Hohenzollern. When the Hohenzollern estates in Silesia were seized by the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand II after the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, he gave ≈öwierklaniec in pawn to his money lender Lazarus I Henckel von Donnersmarck. The Donnersmarcks acquired Neudeck in 1629 and held it for more than 300 years until the end of World War II. Elevated to Reichsgrafen in 1651, the Protestant Tarnowitz-Neudeck branch of the House of Donnersmarck had the Old Castle rebuilt in a Renaissance style with extended gardens and again redesigned during the Baroque era. =New Castle= New Castle Rearing equestrian sculpture by Emmanuel Fr√©miet, in the garden. Forest woodlands, pond, and waterfowl in ≈öwierklaniec Park Carl Lazarus Henckel von Donnersmarck (1772‚Äì1864) largely increased the family possessions around Neudeck and had the Old Castle rebuilt in a Tudor Revival style. His son, the industrial magnate Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck (1830-1916) had the New Castle erected from 1868 onwards, modelled on his Ch√¢teau de Pontchartrain near Paris. The construction was finished under the management of Hector Lefuel, chief architect of the Louvre Palace, until 1876 The historic Neudeck landscape park then contained the impressive palatial complex and the extensive English landscape garden with the Cavalier Palace (Kavalierspalast) erected in 1906. Emperor Wilhelm II stayed several times at Schloss Neudeck, both for hunting and applying for credit. He elevated Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck to the noble rank of a prince (F√ºrst) in 1901. After World War I and the Upper Silesia plebiscite, ≈öwierklaniec joined the Second Polish Republic. Nevertheless, the Donnersmarcks retained their possessions and from 1922 to 1937, the former Swiss president Felix Calonder, as chairman of the mixed German-Polish commission, resided at the Cavalier Palace to supervise the execution of the Upper Silesian Convention. =≈öwierklaniec Park= Again occupied by Nazi German troops in the course of the 1939 Invasion of Poland, the area was re-conquered by Red Army forces during the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive in early 1945. The Donnersmarck family fled and the castles were devastated. The Baroque Garden √† la fran√ßaise and landscape park, with significant statues by 19th-century artist Emmanuel Fr√©miet and fountains that survived, is within the former Palace's extensive forested landscape grounds.

Dick Fulton was built in 1857 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. She was repaired or modified there in 1862, and 1878. During the Civil War she was used as a tender and ram in the United States Ram Fleet, from 1862 to ca. 1864. War service In March 1862 Grant and Buell were preparing for a campaign into Mississippi. A crucial part of the campaign would be the capturing of Island No. 10. On 31 March Scranton commissioned Charles Ellet, Jr. to create a \\"Ram Fleet\\" in twenty days. In one of his transactions Ellet bought Lioness and Fulton for $20,000 in Pittsburgh. These two boats were small, fast stern-wheelers, he intended them to be used as tenders and dispatch boats. In all he bought five vessels, the first problem was they were too big too pass through the locks on the Ohio River, so they were modified so they could be floated over the falls before the river fell. All had their bows armored at New Albany or Mound City, and were ready for service at the end of April. Meanwhile, Grant had succeeded in sending two ironclads past Island No. 10 opening the Mississippi River to Fort Pillow, but Ellet continued with his plans. Come 26 April Ellet was with his fleet in Pittsburgh. The fleet he had assembled of nine vessels were not armed and were all old riverboats, it included the stern-wheeled towboats Fulton and T.D Horner, which were not intended for fighting. Ellet working for the War Department as opposed to the Navy, spent his time reinforcing the rams. On 6 June 1862, she attended the Battle of Memphis, by 19 June she was with the squadron at the mouth of the St. Francis River, and then headed for Greenville. Charles Ellet died at Memphis, he had led the rams in the battle on . During this complete Union victory, Queen of the West and Monarch both rammed and sank the Confederate flagship . Ellet wounded during the battle (the only Union casualty), died of his injuries hospital at Cairo, Illinois fifteen days later on 21 June. On 22 June Fulton repaired her burned boiler at Paw Paw Island before heading downriver with Monarch and Lancaster on a scouting mission. Fulton in early 1863 was operating along with Monarch in the Greenville area moving provisions and stores. Ellet's brother Brigadier General Alfred W. Ellet newly in command took his Federal rams, now referred to as the Mississippi Marine Brigade, were a part of the Western Flotilla in the charge of Charles Henry Davis. The flotilla moved downstream from Memphis towards the besieged Vicksburg, Mississippi on 25 June, where they intended to run its batteries, link up with Farragut, and attack Vicksburg on 28 June. Ellet was on his flagship Monarch, and had with him Lancaster, Mingo, Lioness, and Dick Fulton. The rams had 300 hand-picked sharpshooters with them from the 53rd Illinois Infantry Regiment, an observer described the fleet as dark, silent, and sinister. The Confederates damaged her at Cyrus Point on 10 February 1863. In March 1863 she was commanded by First Master S. Cadman, she had been recently repaired and was at the Yazoo Pass with the ram Lioness, and the tinclad Petrel. On going through the pass the overhanging willows damaged the fleets tall chimney's and high cabins. On arrival at Coldwater they had lost their chimneys and their wheels were damaged, one of Fultons boilers had broken down and she was lagging behind the others. The other two vessels set about gathering cotton so the boats could use it to protect their sharpshooters on their upper decks. They entered Tallahassee on 10 March and met and destroyed the heavily cotton- laden sidewheel steamer Thirty-Fifth Parallel. On 11 March the squadron attacked Fort Pemberton and rammed Star of the West which had previously been scuttled as a defense mechanism. The engagement was not a success and the vessels returned to the Yazoo Pass. Porter was not to use the vessel again in a meaningful way other as low key escort work, Fulton from that point was used as a tow boat. After the Confederacy's naval capability declined she then went onto serve in the successor to the Ram Fleet, the Mississippi Marine Brigade. She was involved in a collision with Hawkeye at Point Pittsburgh on 5 February 1864. She was raised and rebuilt. Her engineer was killed in the incident. In March 1864 she is in Vicksburg with several barges of coal. The Brigade was disestablished in August that year. Post war In August and September 1898 Dick Fulton was put in for repair at the Monongahela River, at the Elizabeth Marine Ways in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania.

Definitions in the International Health Regulations (IHR) of the World Health Organization are: * \\"Disinfection\\" means the procedure whereby health measures are taken to control or kill infectious agents on a human or animal body surface or in or on baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods and postal parcels by direct exposure to chemical or physical agents. * ‚ÄúDisinsection‚Äù means the procedure whereby health measures are taken to control or kill the insect vectors of human diseases present in baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods and postal parcels. Disinsection is mandated by the IHR. The WHO recommends d-phenothrin (2%) for space spraying and permethrin (2%) for residual disinsection. Neither is harmful when used as recommended, according to WHO. Disinsection is one of two applications of the IHR likely to be encountered by travelers; yellow fever vaccination is the other.

Ancient tradition holds that this wall was built by Romulus. The Murus Romuli as remembered by ancient historians is described by Rodolfo Lanciani: > The text most frequently quoted in reference to the Murus Romuli is that of > Tacitus, according to which the furrow ploughed by the hero ‚Äî the sulcus > primigenius ‚Äî started from a point in the Forum Boarium, marked in later > times by the bronze Bull of Myron; and followed the valley between the > Palatine and the Aventine as far as the altar of Consus, the valley between > the Palatine and the C√¶lian as far as the Curi√¶ Veteres, the east slope of > the hill as far as the Sacellum Larum. The same historian says that the Ara > Maxima of Hercules was included within the furrow, and Dionysius states that > Vesta's temple was outside it. The furrow followed the foot of the cliffs or > slopes of the Palatine, its course being marked with stone cippi. Others > affirm that the city of Romulus was square (œÑŒµœÑœÅŒ¨Œ≥œâŒΩŒøœÇ ‚Äî Roma Quadrata). The > truth is that neither the walls nor the pomerium of Romulus can be said to > make a square; that a line drawn from beyond the Ara Maxima to the Ara Consi > cannot be said to go \\"along the foot of the cliffs of the Palatine\\" (per ima > montis Palatini); that the valley in those days was covered with water, deep > enough to be navigated by canoes, so that neither a furrow could be ploughed > through it, nor stone cippi set up to mark the line of the furrow. Moreover, > the same marshes extended on the southeast side as far as the Curi√¶ Veteres, > on the northwest as far as the Temple of Vesta; and the shape of the > Palatine walls was rather trapezoid, like that of a terramara of the valley > of the Po, than square like an Etruscan templum; while, lastly, the name of > Roma Quadrata did not belong to the city on the hill, but to the altar > described in Pagan and Christian Rome, p. 70, which stood in front of the > Temple of Apollo.Lanciani, Rodolfo; The Ruins and Excavations of Ancient > Rome, Houghton, Mifflin and Company; 1897 Though most often believed to be purely a figure of myth, Romulus is believed by some scholars, such as Andrea Carandini, to have been an actual historical figure,Carandini; La nascita di Roma.

C. circa); Torino: Einaudi, 2006 in part because of the 1988 discovery on the north slope of the Palatine Hill of what they believe is the defensive wall built when Rome was founded. These archaeologists contend that the discovery of the wall, along with other nearby finds, indicate that Rome emerged as a dynamic society in the 7th and 6th centuries B.C., significantly earlier than had been previously calculated.Suro, Roberto; Newly Found Wall May Give Clue To Origin of Rome, Scientist Says; New York Times, June 10, 1988 References Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 5th century BC Category:Walls of Rome Category:Roman walls in Italy ","title":"Murus Romuli"},{"id":"13609912","text":"The Edmonstone Baronetcy, of Duntreath in the County of Stirling, is a title in the Baronetage of Great Britain.

This station is under ownership of Cumulus Media. Programming , weekday syndicated programming includes shows by John Batchelor, Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, and Michael Savage plus Red Eye Radio and America's Morning News. Weekend programming includes the syndicated The Kim Komando Show hosted by Kim Komando, Smoke This! hosted by Cigar Dave, and Sporting News Radio, and talk shows hosted by Clark Howard, Larry Kudlow, and Gary Sullivan.

On air disc-jockeys included Brother Dave Miller, Bill Young, Steve Preston, Ron Mani, Lil' Country Joe, Ranger Rick Stewart a.k.a. Ricky Horror, Ken Ayers, Tim Rainey, Lisa Lee, and Skip Eliot. History This station was launched as WALB in May 1941 by The Albany Herald. In 1954, the Herald signed on a TV station with the callsign WALB-TV. The AM radio station has been assigned the \\"WALG\\" call letters by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since it was sold by the Herald to Allen Woodall, Sr., in 1960. From 1959 till about 1970 the station was known as \\"Johnny Reb Radio\\". The rock and roll station was a reporting station for the Gavin Report during those years and therefore had much influence in the southeast U.S. The studios were located in an area north of the city of Albany near a swamp. The area surrounding the station was low country and covered with water most of the time. A raised walkway led from the small parking lot to the studio. Many deejays were delayed in their air shifts because a fat cottonmouth snake would be sunning themselves on the walkway. WALG was the 'white' pop/rock station in Albany for decades, and was on the cutting edge of the ever-changing pop music scene for most of that period. There were radio alternatives in Albany such as WGPC, Albany's first station which signed on in 1933. It played beautiful music, and was a charter station for the Atlanta Braves when they moved to Georgia in 1966. For country fans, there was WJAZ at 960 AM, and WLYB went on the air in the 1960s, at 1250AM. Its studio was off Old Leesburg Road, near WALG's transmitter. The 'black' station was WJIZ-FM. Its 100,000-watt transmitter put a listenable signal into Panama City, Florida. At the Holiday Inn Studio in the 1960s At one time, WALG even featured traffic reports from an airplane flying over the city, broadcast via 2-way radio piped through the radio console. WALG was also a social innovator. At a time when black voices were only heard on black radio stations, WALG News featured Eddie Grissom, the first black news voice on a 'white' Albany station. It began as a 1,000-watt station, omnidirectional, and then went to 5 kW day, and 1 kW night, with a southerly directional signal that protected WTGA, also at 1590, in Thomaston, Georgia. A \\"First Phone\\" license was required to operate the station until more modern equipment was installed in the 1970s, because at power change, the 'Phase Angle' of the signal had to be changed as part of the FCC requirements. The transmitter was and is located off Old Leesburg Road, at the end of Dunbar Lane, but the studio was for many years located in the Holiday Inn, downtown. This was set to music in some WALG jingles that sang: \\"We're in a Holiday Inn!\\" The former studio on Dunbar Lane.Cumulus moved the WALG studio to the old First State Bank building on the corner of South Slappey Blvd. and Broad Avenue in the 1990s, and the old studio building on Dunbar is boarded up today. For a time that building was leased to a small FM station licensed to Camilla. On-air personalities from the 1970s included Ron Mani, \\"Jimmy J.\\" (Jim Janulis), \\"Buzz One\\" (Ron Brown), J.J. Stone (Billy Thorman) Christopher Hayes, Rick Ledbetter, Jim King, Sonny Lofton, \\"Jane\\", Bill Young, Skip Eliot, Kris Van Dyke, Dave Miller, Jack O'Brien, Mike Speers, Carol Ward, 'Spanky', Rick Stewart, Hal Edwards, Otis Ulm, and Steve Preston. Rockin Rodney did over nights in the early 1970s and later returned as Jaxon Riley in the mid-seventies. The name Jaxon was given to him by Howard Toole aka Howard J Clark. WALG was managed by many different people through the years, but perhaps its most memorable GM was Mark Shor. Mark was a New Yorker who sold radio ads in deepest South Georgia. Under Shor, WALG, and later with WKAK in the mix, the station saw it highest billing. At its apogee, WALG & WKAK employed thirty people, was live 24/7. Shor mostly worked for the Woodalls, first Whitfield, then Alan. There was a period when Shor parted way with the Woodalls, circa 1973-1975. John Long was General Manager under owner Ilene Berns, who also owned Bang Records.

It interfaces with a computer through an RS-232 serial port using a custom binary protocol. Drivers for the device exist for Mac OS, MS Windows and Linux. Logitech had similar 6DOF devices during the same time period called the Cyberman and Cyberman II. The device was released in 1996, the same year as popular 3D games such as Descent II and Quake. It was originally called the Spaceball Avenger II, a sequel to SpaceTec's Spaceball Avenger.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_Jan_5/ai_17983496/Internet Archive Wayback Machine The SpaceOrb was especially suited for the gameplay of Descent because of the complete freedom-of-motion afforded by its rendering engine. There was strong support for the device in both Quake and Quake II, but the WASD-type keyboard-and-mouse controls eventually became more popular. As of the Half-Life engine (based on the original Quake source), there was specific support for the SpaceOrb's capabilities. Developers later started to drop variable movement speed support, which reduced the 10bit translation force measurement to 1bit per direction. It was originally manufactured and sold by the SpaceTec IMC company (first bought by Labtec, which itself was later bought by Logitech). The device is no longer sold nor supported by Logitech. It has been supplanted by more modern devices sold under Logitech's 3Dconnexion brand, which are all one-handed 3DMice that afford the other hand the freedom to interact with the keyboard/mouse.

Nadia district still has a large chunk of people living in the rural areas. =Infrastructure= There are 32 inhabited villages in Tehatta II CD Block. 100% villages have power supply and drinking water supply. 14 Villages (43.75%) have post offices. 31 villages (96.88%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 23 villages (71.88%) have a pucca approach road and 19 villages (51.38%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 15 villages (46.88%) have agricultural credit societies and 7 villages (21.88%) have banks. Although 100% villages in Nadia district had power supply in 2011, a survey in 2007-08 revealed that less than 50% of households had electricity connection. In rural areas of the country, the tube well was for many years considered to be the provider of safe drinking water, but with arsenic contamination of ground water claiming public attention it is no longer so. Piped water supply is still a distant dream. In 2007-08, the availability of piped drinking water in Nadia district was as low as 8.6%, well below the state average of around 20%. =Agriculture= Although the Bargadari Act of 1950 recognised the rights of bargadars to a higher share of crops from the land that they tilled, it was not implemented fully. Large tracts, beyond the prescribed limit of land ceiling, remained with the rich landlords. From 1977 onwards major land reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. Following land reforms land ownership pattern has undergone transformation. In 2013-14, persons engaged in agriculture in Tehatta II CD Block could be classified as follows: bargadars 4.60%, patta (document) holders 14.11%, small farmers (possessing land between 1 and 2 hectares) 9.80%, marginal farmers (possessing land up to 1 hectare) 32.07% and agricultural labourers 39.43%.As the proportion of agricultural labourers is very high, the real wage in the agricultural sector has been a matter of concern. Tehatta II CD Block had 212 fertiliser depots, 5 seed stores and 56 fair price shops in 2013-14. In 2013-14, Tehatta II CD Block produced 5,313 tonnes of Aman paddy, the main winter crop from 2,038 hectares, 8,311 tonnes of Boro paddy (spring crop) from 2,171 hectares, 5,240 tonnes of Aus paddy (summer crop) from 2,652 hectares, 14,997 tonnes of wheat from 3,896 hectares, 161,764 tonnes of jute from 9,792 hectares, 5,466 tonnes of potatoes from 181 hectares and 9,422 tonnes of sugar cane from 94 hectares. It also produced pulses and oilseeds. In 2013-14, the total area irrigated in Tehatta II CD Block was 1,745 hectares, out of which 1,239 hectares were irrigated by river lift irrigation, 422 hectares by deep tube wells and 84 hectares by deep tube well. =Banking= In 2013-14, Tehatta II CD Block had offices of 2 commercial banks and 4 gramin banks. Transport Tehatta II CD Block has 6 ferry services and 4 originating/ terminating bus routes. The nearest railway station is 18 km from CD Block headquarters. SH 14 originates from Betai in this block and runs to Dubrajpur (in Birbhum district). Education In 2013-14, Tehatta II CD Block had 83 primary schools with 7,307 students, 2 middle schools with 306 students, 3 high school with 2,636 students and 9 higher secondary schools with 16,320 students. Tehatta II CD Block had 2 technical/ professional institutions with 205 students and 224 institutions for special and non-formal education with 11,518 students In Tehatta II CD Block, amongst the 32 inhabited villages, 2 had no school, 24 had more than 1 primary school, 12 had at least 1 primary school, 18 had at least 1 primary and 1 middle school and 12 had at least 1 middle and 1 secondary school. Healthcare In 2014, Tehatta II CD Block had 1 block primary health centre, 2 primary health centres and 3 private nursing homes with total 65 beds and 9 doctors (excluding private bodies). It had 18 family welfare subcentres. 4,232 patients were treated indoor and 280,192 patients were treated outdoor in the hospitals, health centres and subcentres of the CD Block. Palashipara (Pritimoyee) Rural Hospital, with 30 beds at Palashipara, is the major government medical facility in the Tehatta II CD block. There are primary health centres at Barnia (with 10 beds) and Chhota Nalda (with 6 beds). Tehatta II CD Block is one of the areas of Nadia district where ground water is affected by high level of arsenic contamination. The WHO guideline for arsenic in drinking water is 10 mg/ litre, and the Indian Standard value is 50 mg/ litre. All the 17 blocks of Nadia district have arsenic contamination above this level. The maximum concentration in Tehatta II CD Block is 950 mg/litre. Culture Attractions in the area are ‚Äì Sonargouranga temple (with the golden statue of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu), Chandroday temple and a church. A famous and oldest indigo Kuthi is situated near 3 km at Nishcintapur in demolished form.

Rubens received the commission in the autumn of 1621. After negotiating the terms of the contract in early 1622, the project was to be completed within two years, coinciding with the marriage of Marie's daughter, Henrietta Maria. Twenty-one of the paintings depict Marie's own struggles and triumphs in life. The remaining three are portraits of herself and her parents. The paintings now hang in the Louvre in Paris. Commission Much speculation exists on the exact circumstances under which Marie de' Medici decided to commission Rubens to paint \\"such a grandiose project, conceived in truly heroic proportions\\".Saward, p. 2. John Coolidge suggests the cycle may have even been commissioned to rival another famous series of Rubens, The Constantine Tapestries, which he designed in his studio at the same time as the first several paintings of the Medici Cycle.Saward, pp. 1-3. It has also been suggested that Rubens prepared a number of oil sketches, by the request of Louis XIII, the son of Marie de' Medici and successor to the throne, which may have influenced the Queen's decision to commission Rubens for the cycle by the end of the year 1621. The immortalizing of her life, however, seems to be the most apparent reason for the Queen's choice to commission a painter who was capable of executing such a demanding task. Peter Paul Rubens had already established himself as an exceptional painter and also had the advantage of sustaining close ties with several important people of the time, including Marie de' Medici's sister, the wife of one of Rubens's first important patrons, the Duke of Gonzaga. The information about the commission in the contract Rubens signed is far from detailed and focuses mainly on the number of pictures in the cycle dedicated to the Queen's life, and is far less specific when it comes to the cycle praising her husband Henry IV.Saward, pp. 1-2. The contract stated that Rubens was to paint all the figures, which presumably allowed him to employ assistants for backgrounds and details.Belkin, p. 176 Marie de' Medici upright Marie de' Medici became the second wife to King Henry IV of France in a marriage by proxy on 5 October 1600 by the power invested in her uncle, Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany.Belkin, p. 182 When Henry was assassinated in 1610, Louis XIII, his son and successor to the throne, was only eight years old. Louis' mother, Marie, acted as his regent as commanded by the Frankish Salic law in case of an infant ruler. However, even after Louis came of age at thirteen in 1614, the queen continued ruling in his stead. In 1617, Louis XIII finally decided to take governing matters in his own hands at the age of fifteen and the queen was exiled to Blois. Louis and his mother were not reconciled for over four years, and finally in 1621 Marie was permitted to return to Paris. Upon her return, Marie focused on building and decorating the Luxembourg Palace, an enormous undertaking in which Peter Paul Rubens played a key role. Rubens, then court painter to the Duchy of Mantua under Vincenzo I Gonzaga,Belkin, 42 had first met Marie at her proxy wedding in Florence in 1600.Smith, p. 127. In 1621, Marie de' Medici commissioned Rubens to paint two large series depicting the lives of herself and her late husband, Henry IV, to adorn both wings of the first floor of the Luxembourg Palace.Belkin, pp. 173‚Äì175. The first series of 21 canvases depicts the life of Marie in largely allegorical terms, and was finished by the end of 1624, to coincide with the celebrations surrounding the wedding of her daughter, Henrietta Maria to Charles I of England on 11 May 1625.Belkin, pp. 175‚Äì176. The cycle of paintings dedicated to the life of Henry IV was never completed, although some preliminary sketches survive. (See #Henry IV Cycle below). The fact that the Henry IV series was not realized can be attributed in part to Marie de' Medici being permanently banned from France by her son in 1631. She escaped to Brussels, and later died in exile in 1642 in the same house that the Peter Paul Rubens's family had occupied more than fifty years prior.Belkin pp. 174-175 While this cycle was one of Rubens's first great commissions, Marie de' Medici's life proved a difficult one to portray. Rubens had the task of creating twenty-one paintings about a woman whose life could be measured by her marriage to Henry IV and the births of her six children, one of which died in infancy.Belkin, p. 178. At this time, women did not in general receive such laudatory tributes, although Rubens, if anyone, was well equipped for the job, having a great respect for \\"the virtues of the opposite sex\\", as seen in his commissions for the Archduchess Isabella. Furthermore, unlike her husband, Marie's life was neither graced with triumphant victories nor punctuated by vanquished foes. Rather, implications of political scandal in her life made any literal depiction of the events far too controversial for Rubens to execute without incurring the disapproval from others in government.Belkin, p.179 Far from failing, Rubens demonstrated his impressive knowledge of classical literature and artistic traditions,Belkin, p. 170. by using allegorical representations to both glorify the mundane aspects and sensitively illustrate the less favorable events in Marie's life. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries iconography of the Christian world, as well as that of the Greek and Roman pantheon was understood by well- educated artists and citizens alike, and a familiar device used in artistry.Belkin, p. 180 Rubens painted extravagant images of the Queen Mother surrounded by ancient gods and at times even deified her using these devices. The ambiguity of the figures was essentially used to depict Marie in a positive light.Belkin, pp. 176-181. Rubens's Medici commission was an inspiration for other artists as well, particularly the French painters Jean- Antoine Watteau (1684‚Äì1721) and Fran√ßois Boucher (1703‚Äì1770) who produced copies from the Medici cycle.Belkin, pp. 323.  Rubens  upright Peter Paul Rubens (1577‚Äì1640) was a highly influential artist in Northern Europe, widely believed to have played an important role in shaping the style and visual language of his time. The overseer or creator of more than three thousand woodcuts, engravings and paintings in various mediums, Rubens's works include historical, religious and allegorical paintings, altarpieces, portraits and landscapes.Belkin, p. 4 He is particularly known for his portrayal of human figures, lush and richly colored fabrics and well-developed themes often derived from both Christian and classical traditions.Belkin, p. 8 Rubens's studies of classical, Greek, and Latin texts influenced his career and set him apart from other painters during his time.Belkin, p. 20 Early in his career, Rubens studied under Flemish artists such as Otto van Veen,Belkin, p. 26 but his most notable influences come from the time he spent in Italy where he studied ancient sculpture and the works of Michelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio, Titian, and Veronese. It was during his time in Italy that he began to make copies of classical sculpture, such as the Laoco√∂n Group, and collect drawings done by other artists. However, the artist was also an avid collector of both reproductions and original works, not only from the masters of the Italian Renaissance, but more predominantly from his contemporaries. Rubens owned more prints from his contemporary, Adriaen Brouwer, than any other of his Italian influences or his own contemporaries, although it is suggested that Rubens's compassion and concern for Brouwer's career may have been the influential cause for his collection of Brouwer's work.Belkin p. 143 This record of visual history and the influences of his contemporaries, some who became lifelong friends of Rubens, would make an imprint on his art throughout his entire life.Belkin, pp. 41-59 When Rubens was commissioned to paint the Marie de' Medici cycle, he was quite possibly the most famous and skilled artist in Northern Europe, and was especially appreciated for his monumental religious works, commissioned by various councils and churches in the area. However, the Medici commission was welcomed by Rubens as an opportunity to apply his skills within a secular scene.Belkin, p. 173 The benefits of Marie de' Medici's commission continued throughout the rest of Rubens's career. Not only did he further establish and publicize his skill, but also the similarities that exist in his later works, such as stylistic components and themes, undeniably reflect the Medici series. The Paintings The Destiny of Maria de' Medici Originally the paintings were hung clockwise in chronological order, decorating the walls of a waiting room expanding from a royal apartment in Marie de' Medici's Luxembourg Palace. The paintings are now displayed in the same order in the Louvre.Belkin, p. 181. There is an additional claim that Marie had envisioned these paintings to be studied alternately, left to right, so the thoughtful viewer would have had to crisscross down the gallery.Coolidge, p. 68. Coolidge also argues that Marie envisioned the subjects as falling into pairs, and further into groups. Therefore, Marie's visual biography was divided into three main chapters: childhood, life as a married queen, and the regency as a widow.Coolidge, 69. All of the paintings have the same height although they vary in width in order to fit the shape of the room they were intended for. The sixteen paintings that covered the long walls of the gallery measure about four meters tall by three meters wide, the three larger paintings at the end of the room are four meters high by seven meters wide. Originally the viewer would have entered the gallery from the southeast corner. The most visible works from this angle were The Coronation in Saint Denis and The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency. Coolidge, 70. The cycle began at the entrance wall, featuring images of Marie's childhood years and her marriage to Henry IV. Four of the images are devoted to the marriage, possibly because marriage at Marie's relatively advanced age of twenty-seven was quite rare for a woman at the time. This half ends with a depiction of Marie's coronation. The wall opposite the gallery's entrance presents an image of the assassination and assumption of Henry IV, as well as the proclamation of the widowed Marie's regency. From there, the second half of Rubens' cycle begins addressing the more controversial issues from Marie's reign. For example, both the altercation and reconciliation with her son Louis XIII are subjects Marie de' Medici commissioned Rubens to paint for this gallery.Belkin, pp. 181-182. The historical period that encompassed the subject matter for the paintings was a time of political upheaval in which Rubens sought not to offend the reigning French monarch. Rubens thus turned to mythological allusions, emblematic references, personifications of vices and virtues and religious analogies to veil an often unheroic or ambiguous reality. Within this context Rubens' approach to 'historical truth' may appear selective or, worse, dishonest, but he was neither a historian in the modern sense, nor a journalist; the Medici cycle is not reportage, but rather poetic transformation.Belkin p. 179 As a narrative source for the Marie de' Medici cycle Rubens used an ancient genera of writing in which ideal kingship, and good government were explored. This genera of writing is called the Panegyric. Panegyric writings were usually written during an important political event, the birth of a prince for example, and were used to exalt the qualities and ancestry of a ruler. A formal chronological structure is followed in Panegyric writings detailing the ancestry, birth, education and life of the individual. Rubens followed this structure in his series of paintings about Marie de' Medici.Saward, pp. 9-11. The price of Marie de' Medici Cycle was roughly 24,000 guilders for the 292 square meters, which calculates to about 82 guilders, or 1,512 dollars, per square meter.Downes, p. 362 =The Destiny of Marie de' Medici= The first painting of the narrative cycle, The Destiny of Marie de' Medici, is a twisting composition of the three Fates on clouds beneath the celestial figures of Juno and Jupiter. The Fates are depicted as beautiful, nude goddesses spinning the thread of Marie de' Medici's destiny; their presence at Marie's birth assures her prosperity and success as a ruler that is unveiled in the cycle's subsequent panels.Saward, pp.22-25 In Greek and Roman mythology, one Fate spun the thread, another measured its length, and the third cut the thread. In Rubens' depiction, however, the scissors necessary for this cutting are omitted, stressing the privileged and immortal character of the Queen's life.Thuillier, Jacques. Rubens' Life of Marie de' Medici. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1967. The last panel of the cycle, in accordance with this theme, illustrates Queen Marie rising up to her place as queen of heaven, having achieved her lifelong goal of immortality through eternal fame.Millen & Wolf, pp. 26-29 Early interpretations explained Juno's presence in the scene through her identity as the goddess of childbirth. Later interpretations suggested, however, that Rubens used Juno to represent Marie de' Medici's alter ego, or avatar, throughout the cycle. Jupiter accordingly signifies the allegory of Henry IV, the promiscuous husband. =The Birth of the Princess= The Birth of the Princess, in Florence on 26 April 1573. The cycle's second painting, The Birth of the Princess, represents Medici's April 26, 1573 birth. Symbols and allegory appear throughout the painting. On the left, two putti play with a shield on which the Medici crest appears, suggesting that Heaven favored the young Medici from the moment of her birth. The river god in the picture's right corner is likely an allusion to the Arno River that passes through Florence, Marie's city of birth. The cornucopia above the infant's head can be interpreted as a harbinger of Marie's future glory and fortune; the lion may be seen as symbolic of power and strength.Matilde Battistini, Symbole und Allegorien The glowing halo around the infant's head should not be seen as a reference to Christian imagery; rather, it should be read according to imperial iconography which uses the halo as an indication of the Queen's divine nature and of her future reign.Saward, pp.32-33 Though Marie was born under the Taurus sign, Sagittarius appears in the painting; it may be seen as a guardian of imperial power.Saward, pp. 29-30 =Education of the Princess= The Education of the Princess Education of the Princess (1622‚Äì1625) shows a maturing Marie de' Medici at study. Her education is given a divine grace by the presence of three gods Apollo, Athena, and Hermes. Apollo being associated with art, Athena with wisdom, and Hermes the messenger god for a fluency and understanding of language.Vandergriff, The Life of Marie de' Medici Hermes dramatically rushes in on the scene and literally brings a gift from the gods, the caduceus. It is generally thought that Hermes endows the princess with the gift of eloquence, to go along with the Grace's gift of beauty. However, the caduceus, which is seen in six other paintings in the cycle, has also been associated with peace and harmony. The object may be seen as foretelling of Marie's peaceful reign.Millen, p. 44. It can be interpreted that the combined efforts of these divine teachers represent Marie's idyllic preparedness for the responsibilities she will obtain in the future, and the trials and tribulations she will face as Queen.Saward, p. 42. It is also suggested that the three gods, more importantly, offer their guidance as a gift that allows the soul to be \\"freed by reason\\" and gain the knowledge of what is \\"good\\" revealing the divine connection between the gods and the future Queen.Saward, p. 45. The painting displays an embellished Baroque collaboration of the spiritual and earthly relationships, which are illustrated in a theatrical environment.Smith, p 128. Acting as more than just static symbols the figures portrayed take an active role in her education. Also present are the three graces, Euphrosyne, Aglaea, and Thalia giving her beauty. =The Presentation of Her Portrait to Henry IV= The Presentation of Her Portrait to Henry IV To fully appreciate and value this particular cycle piece and the collection as a whole, there is one historical principle to take into account. This painting was created on the cusp of the age of absolutism and, as such, one must remember royalty were considered above corporeal existence. So from birth, Marie would have led a life more ornamental than mortal. This painting of classical gods, along with allegorical personifications, aptly shows the viewer how fundamental this idea was.Held, p. 205 Just as Tamino in The Magic Flute, Henry IV falls in love with a painted image. With Amor the Cupid as his escort, Hymenaios, the god of marriage, displays the princess Marie on canvas to her future king and husband. Meanwhile, Jupiter and Juno are sitting atop clouds looking down on Henry as they provide the viewer a key example of marital harmony and thus show approval for the marriage.Saward, p. 51. A personification of France is shown behind Henry in her helmet, her left hand showing support, sharing in his admiration of the future sovereignty. Rubens had a way of depicting France that was very versatile in gender in many of his paintings in the cycle. Here France takes on an androgynous role being both woman and man at the same time. Frances's intimate gesture may suggest a closeness between Henry and his country. This gesture would usually be shared among male companions, telling each other's secret. The way France is also dressed shows how female she is on top revealing her breasts and the way the fabric is draped adding notions of classicism. However her bottom half, most notably her exposed calves and Roman boots hints at a masculinity. A sign of male strength in the history of imagery was their stance and exposed strong legs.Cohen, p.493 This connection between the two show that not only are the gods in favor of the match, the King also has the well wishes of his people. In negotiating the marriage between Marie de' Medici and Henry IV, a number of portraits were exchanged between the two. The king was pleased with her looks, and upon meeting her was impressed even more by her, than with her portraits. There was great approval of the match, as the pope and many powerful Florentine nobles had been advocates of the marriage and had worked at convincing the king of the benefits of such a union.Millen, pp. 49-50 The couple were married by proxy on October 5, 1600.Millen, p. 15 Rubens is able to coalesce these characters together into a single united front. He creates equality between all of the figures in the painting by cleverly balancing corporeal and ethereal space. =The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV= The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV (1622‚Äì25), Rubens depicts the proxy marriage ceremony of the Florentine princess Marie de' Medici to the King of France, Henry IV which took place in the cathedral of Florence on October 5, 1600. Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini presides over the ritual. As was often the case with royal weddings, the bride's uncle, the Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany stood in the King's place and is pictured here slipping a ring on his niece's finger. All the surrounding figures are identifiable, including the artist himself. Although he was present at the actual event twenty years earlier, as a member of the Gonzaga household during his travels in Italy, Rubens appears youthful and stands behind the bride, holding a cross and gazing out at the viewer. It is highly unlikely that Rubens actually had such a pronounced presence in this scene when it took place. Those who attended the ceremony for Marie include Grand Duchess Cristina of Tuscany and Marie's sister Eleonora, Duchess of Mantua; and in entourage of Grand Duke are Roger de Bellegarde, Grand Esquire of France, and the Marquis de Sillery, who negotiated the marriage. As in other scenes in the Medici Cycle, Rubens includes a mythological element: the ancient god of marriage, Hymenaios wearing a crown of roses, carries the bride's train in one hand and the nuptial torch in the other.Belkin, pp.182-185 The scene takes place below a marble statue, which depicts God the Father mourning over the dead body of Christ, alluding to the Pieta sculpture by Baccio Bandinelli (1493‚Äì1560). =The Disembarkation at Marseilles= The Disembarkation at Marseilles Having never been a particularly graceful event for anyone, disembarking a ship does not pose a problem for Rubens in his depiction of Marie de' Medici arriving in Marseilles after having been married to Henry IV by proxy in Florence. Rubens has again, turned something ordinary into something of unprecedented magnificence. He depicts her leaving the ship down a gangplank (she actually walked up, not down, but was illustrated this way by Rubens to create a diagonal element). She was accompanied by the Grand Duchess of Tuscany and her sister, the Duchess of Mantua, into the welcoming, allegorical open arms of a personified France, wearing a helmet and the royal blue mantle with the golden fleur-de-lis. Her sister and aunt flank Marie while two trumpets are blown simultaneously by an ethereal Fame, announcing her arrival to the people of France. Below, Poseidon, three Nereids, a sea-god and Triton rise from the sea, after having escorted the future Queen on the long voyage to procure her safe arrival in Marseilles. To the left, the arms of the Medici can be seen above an arched structure, where a Knight of Malta stands in all of his regalia. It is melody and song as Rubens combines heaven and Earth, history and allegory into a symphony for the eyes of the viewer.Janson, pp. 703-705 On a side note, Avermaete discusses an interesting idea that is particularly present in this canvas.Avermaete, Roger. Rubens and his times. Cranbury, New Jersey: A.S. Barnes and Company, 1968 =The Meeting of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV at Lyons= The Meeting of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV at Lyons This painting allegorically depicts the first meeting of Marie and Henry, which took place after their nuptials by proxy. The upper half of the painting shows Marie and Henry as the mythological Roman gods Juno and Jupiter. The representations are accompanied by their traditional attributes. Marie is shown as Juno (Greek Hera) identified by the peacocks and chariot. Henry is shown as Jupiter (Greek Zeus) identified by the fiery thunderbolts in his hand and the eagle. The joining of the couple's right hands is a traditional symbol of the marriage union. They are dressed in the classical style, which is naturally appropriate to the scene. Above the two stands Hymen who unites them. A rainbow extends from the left corner, a symbol of concord and peace. The lower half of the painting is dominated by imagery of Lyons. Reading from left to right, we see the cityscape with its single hill. The lions pull the chariot (which is a pun on the name of the city), and in the chariot we see the allegorical figure of the city herself with a crown of her battlements: Lyons. Rubens needed to be very careful in the representation of the couple's first meeting because allegedly Henry was very much involved with a mistress at the time of the marriage. In fact, due to the king's other engagements their introduction was delayed, and it was not until midnight nearly a week after Marie arrived that Henry finally joined his bride. By presenting him as Jupiter Rubens implies the promiscuity of the man and the deity. Simultaneously by placing King and Queen together he effectively illustrates the elevated status of the couple.Belkin p.185 =The Birth of the Dauphin at Fontainebleau= The Birth of the Dauphin at Fountainebleau This painting depicts the birth of Marie de' Medici's first son, Louis XIII. Rubens designed the scene around the theme of political peace.Saward, p. 79 The birth of the first male heir brings a sense of security to the royal family that they will continue to rule. In those times an heir was of the utmost importance, especially if Henry wanted to showcase his masculinity and discontinue with the pattern of the royal reproductive failure.Crawford, Katherine B.,The Politics of Promiscuity: Masculinity and Heroic Representation at the Court of Henry IV French Historical Studies, Vol. 26, No. 2, Special Issue: French History in the Visual Sphere. (Spring, 2003), p.230 The word dauphin is French for dolphin, a term associated with princely royalty. Henry's promiscuity made difficult the production of a legitimate heir, and rumors circulated to the extent that Henry's court artists began to employ strategies to convince the country otherwise. One of these strategies was to personify Marie as Juno or Minerva. By representing Marie as Juno, implying Henry as Jupiter, the king is seen domesticated by marriage. The queen's personification as Minerva would facilitate Henry's military prowess and her own.Crawford, p.246 As a Flemish painter Rubens includes a dog in the painting, alluding to fidelity in marriage. In addition to the idea of political peace Rubens also includes the personification of Justice, Astraea. The return of Astraea to earth is symbolic of the embodiment of continuing Justice with the birth of the future king. Louis is nursed by Themis, the goddess of divine order, referring to Louis XIII birthright to one day become king. The baby is quite close to a serpent, which is a representation of Health.Wedgwood, C.V., p. 103 Rubens incorporates the traditional allegory of the cornucopia, which symbolizes abundance, to enhance the meaning of the painting by including the heads of Marie de' Medici's children who have yet to be born among the fruit. While Marie gazes adoringly at her son, Fecundity presses the cornucopia to her arm, representing the complete and bountiful family to come.McGrath, p. 315 =The Consignment of the Regency= The Consignment of the Regency Throughout the depictions of Marie de' Medici's life, Rubens had to be careful not to offend either Marie or the king, Louis XIII, when portraying controversial events. Marie commissioned paintings that truthfully followed the events of her life, and it was the job of Rubens to tactfully convey these images. More than once, the artistic license of the painter was curbed in order to portray Marie in the right light. In The Consignment of the Regency, Henry IV entrusts Marie with both the regency of France and the care of the dauphin shortly before his war campaigns and eventual death. Set within a grand Italian-style architectural setting, the theme is somewhat sobering. Prudence, the figure to the right of Marie, was stripped of her emblematic snake to lessen the chances any viewer would be reminded of Marie's rumored involvement in the King's assassination. The efficacy of the form is lost in order to ensure Marie's representation in a positive light. Other changes include the removal of the Three Fates, originally positioned behind the king calling him to his destiny, war, and death. Rubens was forced to remove these mythical figures and replace them with three generic soldiers.McGrath, p. 11 Also worthy of note in this painting is the first appearance of the orb as a symbol of the \\"all-embracing rule or power of the state\\".Winner, p. 68 This particular image appears to carry significant weight in Rubens's iconographic program for the cycle, as it appears in six (one quarter) of the twenty-four paintings of the cycle. This orb functions both as an allusion to the Roman orbis terrarum (sphere of earth) which signifies the domain and power of the Roman emperor, and as a subtle assertion of the claim of the French monarchy upon the imperial crown.Winner, pp. 70, 86 While Rubens was certainly aware of the inherent meaning of the orb and employed it to great effect, it appears that Marie and her counselors instigated its introduction into the cycle to add allegorical and political grandeur to the events surrounding Marie's regency.Winner, pp. 64-70 =The Coronation in Saint-Denis= The Coronation in Saint-Denis The Coronation in Saint-Denis is the last scene on the North End of the West Wall, showing the completion of Marie's divinely assisted preparation. It would be one of two paintings most visually apparent upon entrance into the gallery through the southeast corner. Rubens composes The Coronation in Saint-Denis for distanced viewing by employing accents of red. For example, the robes of two cardinals near the right edge. These accents also create a sense of unity with the neighboring work, Apotheosis of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency. This painting is a representation of an historical event in the life of the Queen where the King and the Queen were crowned at the basilica of Saint-Denis in Paris. Considered one of the principal paintings in the series along with the Apotheosis of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency both scenes also show Marie de' Medici receiving the orb of state. She is conducted to the altar by the Cardinals Gondi and de Sourdis, who stand with her along with Mesieurs de Souvrt and de Bethune. The ceremony is officiated by Cardinal Joyeuse. The royal entourage includes the Dauphin, the Prince of Conti with the crown, the Duke of Ventadour with the scepter, and the Chevalier de Vend√¥me with the hand of Justice. The Princess of Conti and the Duchess of Montpensier (mother of her future daughter in law) carry the train of the royal mantle. Above in the tribune appears Henry IV, as if to give sanction to the event. The crowd below in the basilica raise their hands in acclamation of the new Queen, and above, the classical personifications of Abundantia and a winged Victoria shower the blessings of peace and prosperity upon the head of Marie by pouring the golden coins of Jupiter.Saward, p. 97Smith, p 129. Also, her pet dogs are placed in the foreground of the painting. Rubens inspiration for the blue coronation orb emblazoned with golden lilies was Guillaume Dupres‚Äô presentation medal struck in 1610 at Marie's‚Äô request portraying her as Minerva with Louis XIII as Apollo-Sol .Ellenius, p. 71. The symbolism carried the message that she was charged with the guidance of the young, soon- to-be king. =The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency= The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency Sometimes also referred to as The Apotheosis of Henry IV and The Proclamation of the Regency, this particular painting within the Medici Cycle as a whole, was placed originally by Rubens as a series of three.Berger, p. 473 The other two having similar design measurements, it was consigned as the middle painting in a pseudo triptych of sorts as it adorned the halls of Marie de' Medici's Palais du Luxembourg. The painting is separated into two distinct, but related scenes: the elevation of Henry IV to the heavens (his assassination on 14 May 1610 resulted in the immediate declaration of Marie as regentSaward, p. 98) and the assumption of Marie to the crown. On the left, Jupiter and Saturn are shown welcoming the assassinated King of France, as he ascends as a personified Roman sovereign, victoriously to Olympus.Vlieghe, p. 49 As with all of Ruben's allegorical paintings, these two figures are chosen for a reason. Jupiter is meant to be the King's celestial counterpart, while Saturn, who represents finite time, is an indication of the end of Henry's mortal existence.Saward, p.100 This particular theme, within the painting as a whole, has found other great masters receiving inspiration and fascination from Rubens' tormented figure of Bellona, the goddess of War, who lays disarmed below. Post-Impressionist, Paul C√©zanne (1839‚Äì1906) registered for permission to copy the goddess as many as ten times.Sutton, p. 92 It should be kept in mind that Rubens's energetic manner of placing all these allegorical themes is substantially resultant from classical coins as documented through communication with his friend and notable collector of antiquities, Nicolas- Claude Fabri de Peiresc. The right side of the panel shows the succession of the new Queen, dressed in solemn clothing suited to a widow. She is framed by a triumphal arch and surrounded by people at the court. The Queen accepts an orb, a symbol of government, from the personification of France while the people kneel before her and this scene is a great example of the exaggeration of facts in the cycle. Rubens stresses the idea of the Regency that was offered to the Queen, though she actually claimed it for herself the same day her husband was murdered. Worthy of note is a possible contemporary inspirational influence on Rubens for the right side of this painting. Although originally started but may or may not have been finished in Rome, Caravaggio's Madonna of the Rosary may well have been an artistic influence on Rubens for the Proclamation of the Regency side of this painting, as the two works are highly corresponding in their presentation. Through a causal nexus, this painting would have been available to Rubens and thereby plausible for its influence to exist within Rubens's own genius on canvas.Berger, pp. 475-476 As a comparison, there are within each, two women upon a dais classical pillars, swathes of luxuriant cloth, genuflecting personages with arms extended, and allegorical figures present. In Rubens's painting, Minerva, Prudence, Divine Providence and France; in the Caravaggio, St Dominic, St Peter the Martyr, and a pair of Dominican friars. Also present in each are objets importants: rudder, globe, and rosaries.Berger, pp.476 All these and more, combine to make a persuasive argument and show a certain artistically respectful nod from Rubens to Caravaggio as two contemporaries of the time. =The Council of the Gods= The Council of the Gods This painting commemorates Marie taking over the government as new regent, and promoting long-term plans for peace in Europe by way of marriages between royal houses.Millen, Wolf p. 16 Cupid and Juno bind two doves together over a split sphere in the painting as a symbol of peace and love.Winner, p. 79 Marie hoped for her son, Louis XIII, to marry the Spanish Infanta Anne and for her daughter Elizabeth to marry the future king of Spain, Philip IV, possibly resulting in an alliance between France and Spain.Millen, p 80 To Marie de' Medici these unions were probably the most significant part of her reign, for peace in Europe was Marie's greatest goal.Winner, p. 81 The Council of the Gods is one of the least understood paintings of Marie de' Medici cycle. It represents the conduct of the Queen and the great care with which she oversees her Kingdom during her Regency. For example, how she overcomes the rebellions and the disorders of the State. It also suggests that she perpetuated the policies and ideals of the late King in his life and in death.Millen, p.145 The painting subjects are placed in a celestial setting which doesn't give way to a particular place, time or event. The scene is painted with a variety of mythological figures. This, along with its setting makes it difficult to figure out the subject matter of the work. The mythological figures include Apollo and Pallas, who combat and overcome vices such as Discord, Hate, Fury, and Envy on the ground and Neptune, Pluto, Saturn, Hermes, Pan, Flora, Hebe, Pomono, Venus, Mars, Zeus, Hera, Cupid, and Diana above.Avermaete, Roger. Rubens and his times. Cranbury, New Jersey: A.S. Barnes and Company, 1968. The mythological figures and celestial setting act as allegories for Marie's peaceful rule over France.Smith, p. 130. =The Regent Militant: The Victory at J√ºlich= The Victory at J√ºlich. The Victory at J√ºlich shows the only military event that the Queen participated in during her regency: the return of J√ºlich (or Juliers in French) to the Protestant princes.Saward, p. 133 Being a crossing of Ruhr, Juliers was of great strategic importance for France and thus the French victory was chosen to be the glorious subject of Rubens' painting. The scene is rich with symbolism highlighting her heroism and victory. The Queen thrusts her arm high with an assembler's baton in hand.Millen and Wolf 155 In the upper part of the image Victoria appears crowning her with laurel leaves which is a symbol of victory. Also symbolizing victory is the imperial eagle which can be seen in the distance. The eagle in the sky compels the weaker birds to flee. The Queen is accompanied by a womanly embodiment of what was once thought to be, Fortitude because of the lion beside her. However, the figure is Magnanimity, also referred to as Generosity, because of the riches held in her palm. One of the pieces in her hand is the Queen's treasured strand of pearls. Other figures include Fame and the personification of Austria with her lion. Fame in the right side of the painting pushes air through the trumpet so powerfully that a burst of smoke comes out. In the painting Marie de' Medici is highly decorated and triumphant after the collapse of a city, she is depicted across a white stallion to demonstrate that, like the departed King Henry IV, she could triumph over rivals in warfare.Wedgwood, C.V., 116. =The Exchange of the Princesses at the Spanish Border= The Exchange of Princesses The Exchange of Princesses celebrates the double marriage of the Anna of Austria to Louis XIII of France and Louis XIII's sister, Princess Elisabeth, to future king of Spain, Philip IV on 9 November 1615. France and Spain present the young princesses, aided by a youth who is probably Hymen. Above them, two putti brandish hymeneal torches, a small zephyr blows a warm breeze of spring and scatter roses, and a circle of joyous butterfly-winged putti surround Felicitas Publica with the caduceus, who showers the couple with gold from her cornucopia. Below, the river Andaye is filled with sea deities come to pay homage to the brides: the river-god Andaye rests on his urn, a nereid crowned with pearls offers a strand of pearls and coral as wedding gifts, while a triton blows the conch to herald the event.Saward, pp.137 The wedding, which was thought to secure peace between France and Spain, took place on a float midway across the Bidassoa River, along the French-Spanish border. In Ruben's depiction, the princesses stand with their right hands joined between personifications of France and Spain. Spain with a recognizable symbol of a lion on her helmet is on the left, whereas France, with fleur-de-lis decorating her drapery, is on the right.Belkin, p.186 Anna, at age fourteen the older of the two, turns back as if to take leave of Spain, while France gently pulls her by the left arm. In turn, Spain can be seen taking the thirteen-year-old Elisabeth by her left arm.Belkin, pp. 186-7 =The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici= The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici This particular painting in the Marie de' Medici Cycle is noteworthy for its uniqueness in execution. While the other paintings were completed at Rubens's studio in Antwerp, The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici was designed and painted entirely by Rubens on the spot to replace another, far more controversial depiction of Marie's 1617 expulsion from Paris by her son Louis. Completed in 1625, this is the final painting in the cycle in terms of chronological order of completion.Belkin, p. 187. Here Marie is shown in allegorical fashion as the personification of Justice itself and flanked by a retinue of some of the primary personifications/gods in the Greek and Roman pantheon. These have been identified as Cupid, Minerva, Prudence, Abundance, Saturn, and two figures of Pheme, all indicated by their traditional attributes, all bestowing their bounties on the Queen. (Cupid has his arrow; Prudence carries a snake entwined around her arm to indicate serpent-like wisdom; Abundance also appears with her cornucopia, also a reference to the fruits of Marie's regency. Minerva, goddess of wisdom, bears her helmet and shield and stands near Marie's shoulder, signifying her wise rule. Saturn has his sickle and is personified as Time here guiding France forward. Fame carries a trumpet to herald the occasion.Belkin, p. 189.) These personifications are accompanied in turn by several allegorical figures in the guise of four putti and three vanquished evil creatures (Envy, Ignorance, and Vice) as well as a number of other symbols that Rubens employed throughout the entire cycle of paintings.Millen & Wolf, p. 164 Though this particular painting is one of the most straightforward in the series, there is still some minor dispute about its significance. Rather than accept this as a depiction of Marie as Justice, some hold that the real subject of the painting is the \\"return to earth of Astraea, the principle of divine justice, in a golden age.\\"Millen & Wolf, p. 166 They support this claim with a statement in Rubens's notes which indicates that \\"this theme holds no special reference to the particular reason of state of the French kingdom.\\"Winner, p. 86 Certain symbolic elements, such as the wreath of oak leaves (a possible corona civica), France being seen as a subjugated province, and the inclusion of Saturn in the scheme might all point to this interpretation and certainly would not have been lost on Rubens. Fortunately, and perhaps solely due to the controversy surrounding this painting, Rubens mentioned its significance in a letter to Peiresc dated 13 May 1625. It reads, > I believe I wrote you that a picture was removed which depicted the Queen's > departure from Paris and that, in its place, I did an entirely new one which > shows the flowing of the Kingdom of France, with the revival of the sciences > and the arts through the liberality and the splendour of Her Majesty, who > sits upon a shining throne and holds a scale in her hands, keeping the world > in equilibrium by her prudence and equity.quoted in Millen & Wolf, p. 165 Considering the haste with which Rubens completed this painting, his lack of specific reference to a golden age in his letter, and the existence of several contemporary depictions of Marie as a figure of Justice, most historians are content with the simpler allegorical interpretation which is more consistent both with Rubens's style and the remainder of the cycle.Millen & Wolf, pp. 166-7 It is believed that the original painting mentioned in the letter depicting Marie's departure from Paris was rejected in favor of The Felicity of the Regency due to the more innocuous subject matter of the latter. Rubens, in the same letter, goes on to say, > \\"This subject, which does not touch on the particular political > considerations ... of this reign, nor have reference to any individual, has > been very well received, and I believe that had it been entrusted altogether > to me the business of the other subjects would have turned out better, > without any of the scandal or murmurings.\\"McGrath, p. 12 Here, we can see evidence of the adaptability of Rubens' style which made his career so successful. His willingness to fit his ideas with those of the patron equipped him with the perfect tools to be in charge of such a delicate and heavily anticipated subject. =Louis XIII Comes of Age= Louis XIII Comes of Age The painting Louis XIII Comes of Age represents the historical scene of the transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means.Millen p.170 Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that hang on the side of the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with what seems to be a trumpet. Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying Force, Religion, Justice, and Concord. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit. The pairing of Marie with the figure of Force gives power to the image of the queen, while Marie's actual pose is more passive, showing very effectively her graceful acknowledgement of her son's authority henceforth.Cohen pp.490-491 It is an interesting painting to examine within the context of the tense relationship between the young king and his mother. Marie had clung to power past the end of her regency, until Louis seized power in 1617 and exiled her to Blois. Rubens obviously would have known this and so chose to ignore the tension surrounding Marie's relationship with her son, instead emphasizing her poise in the transfer of power. =The Flight from Blois= The Flight from Blois The Flight from Blois is a depiction of Queen Marie escaping from confinement at Blois. The Queen stands in a dignified manner, suggesting her poise in times of disarray, amongst a chaotic crowd of handmaidens and soldiers. She is led and protected by a representation of France, and guided by illustrations of Night and Aurora. They are used literally to portray the actual time of the event and shield the queen from spectators as they illuminate her path.Saward, p. 163 Rubens painted a scene of the event in a more heroic nature rather than showing the accuracy of realistic elements. According to historical records of the Queen's escape, this painting is not truthfully reflecting the moment of the occurrence. Rubens did not include many of the negative aspects of the event, fearing that he would offend the Queen, which resulted in the paintings non-realistic nature. The Queen Marie is depicted in a humble way, yet the illustration implies her power over the military. She does not express any hardships she had gone through by the escape. The male figures in foreground reaching for her are unknown. The larger figures in the background represent the military, who were added to have a symbolic meaning of the Queen's belief in the command over military.Millen & Wolf, pp. 178-181 =The Negotiations at Angoul√™me= The Negotiations at Angoul√™me In The Negotiations at Angoul√™me, Marie de' Medici genially takes the olive branch from Mercury, the messenger god, in the presence of both of her priests, as she gives her consent to have discussions with her son concerning her clash to his governmental direction. Rubens uses several methods to portray Queen Marie in precisely the light that she wanted to be seen, as her young son's guardian and wise advisor. Enthroned on a pedestal with sculptures of Minerva's symbols of wisdom and two putti holding a laurel wreath to represent victory and martyrdom, the representation of Marie de' Medici is quite clear. Her humble, yet all-knowing gaze conveys the wisdom that she holds. She is also placed compositionally in a tight and unified group with the cardinals, signifying a truthful side opposed to Mercury's dishonesty. Rubens gave Mercury an impression untruthfulness by illustrating his figure hiding a caduceus behind his thigh. The effect of the two groups of figures is meant to stress the gap between the two sides. Rubens also added a barking dog, a common reference used to indicate or warn someone of foreigners who came with evil intention. All of these symbols, Rubens displayed in this ambiguous and enigmatic painting to represent or \\"misrepresent\\" Marie de' Medici in the manner that portrayed her as the prudent, yet caring and humble mother of a young and na√Øve monarch.Millen & Wolf, pp. 182-193 Overall, this painting is the most problematic or controversial, as well as the least understood out of the entire cycle. This image is of, once again, Marie claiming her of regal authority yet was nonetheless the first step towards peace between mother and son.Millen, p. 182 =The Queen Opts for Security= The Queen Opts for Security Rubens's The Queen Opts for Security represents Marie de' Medici's need for security through a depiction of the event when Marie de' Medici was forced to sign a truce in Angers after her forces had been defeated at Ponte-de-Ce. Though the painting shows Marie de' Medici's desire for security with the representation of the Temple of Security, the symbols of evil at bay, and the change of smoky haze to clarity, there is also underlying symbolism of unrest to the acceptance of the truce. The round shape of the temple, like those built by the ancients to represent the world, and has an Ionic order that is associated with Juno and Maria herself. The temple defines itself, by also including a plaque above the niche that says \\"Securitati Augustae\\" or For the Security of the empress.Millen, p. 197. She is shown with the snakes of the caduceus emblem having uneasy movement and the forced escorting of the queen by Mercury into the Temple of Peace give the feeling of a strong will not to be defeated.Millen & Wolf, p. 197. It can also be debated that the painting is not really about peace or security, but really an unrelenting spirit that does not give into loss.Millen & Wolf, p. 201. As she is a divine power, she is heroically depicted in a classical setting using neoplatonic hierarchy and visual cues of light on her face. These ultimately imply that this allegory of Marie de' Medici is an apotheosis.Millen & Wolf, p. 204. Additionally, the inclusion of two differently adorned personifications of Peace hints at the fact that Rubens wanted to confuse or excite the viewer to look deeper into this particular painting as a whole. =Reconciliation of the Queen and her Son= Reconciliation of the Queen and her son The Return of the Mother to Her Son tenuously held an alternate title The Full Reconciliation with the Son after the Death of the High Constable until the temperament of the nation was assessed. The many headed hydra struck a fatal blow by Divine Justice as witnessed by Divine Providence, a theme based on a classical seventeenth century metaphor for insurrection. Here the monster is a stand in for the dead Constable de Luynes who has met its demise at the hand of a feminine Saint Michael.Millen & Wolf, p. 207 The death in 1621 of the falconer turned supreme commander may have improved the tensions between mother and son, but Conde, considered the most dangerous of Marie de' Medici's foes quickly stepped in to fill the gap. Rubens‚Äô deliberate vagueness would be consistent with his practice of generalizing and allegorizing historical facts especially in a painting about peace and reconciliation.Millen & Wolf, p. 203 Marie, desiring vindication for the death of her close personal friend, Concino Concini, would likely have intended a more direct personal allusion to Constable de Luynes, but Rubens preferring to keep to allegory, avoided specifics that could later prove embarrassing.McGrath, p. 14 The artist chose the high road, relying on Ripa's visual vernacular, to portray a scene where virtues defeat vices and embrace peaceful reconciliation making little more than an allusion to a vague political statement. It is not hard to imagine the much-maligned scapegoat Luyens as the one suffering divine punishment and being thrown into the pits of hell while assuming all the blame for the animosity between Louis XIII and his mother.Millen & Wolf, p. 205 In this painting, Louis XIII, represented as an adult, is depicted as Apollo. The hydra's death is not at the hand of Apollo as might be expected. Instead it is left to an Amazon-like vision of Providence/Fate.Millen & Wolf, p. 209 With the removal of the scales she carried in an earlier sketch that would have connected her to Louis XII, we are left with an entity who with no help from Louis, slays the adversary as he appears oblivious and unconcerned.Millen & Wolf, p. 211 Marie de' Medici however, emerges as a loving mother, ready to forgive all evils and pain endured. =The Triumph of Truth= The Triumph of Truth The last painting in the cycle, The Triumph of Truth, is a purely allegorical depiction of King Louis XIII and his mother, the Queen, reconciling before heaven.Saward, Susan. \\"The Golden Age of Marie de' Medici\\". Ann Arbor. UMI Research Press. 1982 The Queen and Louis XIII are depicted floating in heaven, connected by the symbol of concordia, which demonstrates her sons‚Äô forgiveness and the peace that was reached between them. Below, Saturn raises Veritas to heaven which symbolizes truth being, \\"brought to the light\\", as well as the reconciliation between the Queen and her son.Saward, p. 182. The illustrations of Time and Truth occupy almost 3/4 of the lower canvas. The upper part of the canvas is filled with renderings of Marie and her son. In the composition, Marie is depicted as much larger than her son and occupies much more space.Millen & Wolf p. 220 Her larger, less obscured body is turned frontally on the picture plane, which emphasizes her importance. Her importance is further highlighted by her equal height to her son, the King.Millen & Wolf p. 221 Her son who is obscured in part by the Wing of Time, kneels before the queen and presents her with the token of amity, the clasped hands and flaming heart within a laurel crown.Millen & Wolf. p. 221 Compositionally, Rubens gives the queen greater importance in this panel through the use of gestures and gazes. In the work, Truth gestures toward the Queen while Time looks toward her from below. Both figures ignore the King.Millen & Wolf Rubens artfully projected both mother and son into the future, depicting them as more aged and mature than in the preceding panel (Peace is Confirmed in Heaven).Millen & Wolf pp.220-221. \\"Heroic Deeds and Mystic Figures\\". Princeton. Princeton University Press. 1989. It is at this point that the Medici Cycle changes to the subject of the Queen Mother's reign. With the death of son Louis' court favorite, Charles d'Albert de Luynes, mother and son reconcile. Marie receives ultimate vindication by being re-admitted to the Council of State in January 1622.Millen & Wolf p. 17 This picture represents how time thus uncovers the truth in correspondence to the relationship between Marie and her son. The final painting coincided with Marie's interest in politics after the death of her husband. She believed that diplomacy should be obtained through marriage and it is the marriage of her daughter Henrietta Maria to Charles I that rushed the completion of the Medici Cycle. =The Portraits of The Queen's Parents= The remaining three paintings are portraits of Marie de' Medici, her father Francesco I and her mother Johanna of Austria. On either side of the fireplace in the gallery are the portraits of the Queen's parents. The portrait of the Queen's father, Francesco I, is on the right and faces the passageway towards Marie de' Medici's private chambers. Francesco I is depicted wearing an ermine-lined mantle with a cross around his neck which represents the Tuscan order of Saint Stephen which his father founded. The portrait of the Queen's mother, Johanna of Austria, is on the left at the place where visitors enter. She is shown wearing a gown of silver cloth with gold embroidery and wears nothing that suggests her esteemed background. The model, or overall design, for this portrait of Johanna of Austria goes back to a painting by Alessandro Allori that was then copied by Giovanni Bizzelli. Rubens must have seen these paintings and therefore influenced his own style for depicting the Queen's mother. Although, surprisingly, Ruben's version is considered even less remarkable than the models. This portrait of Johanna of Austria is overall an inexpressive image of a woman. He excluded the traditional 16th Century hieratic poise for a relaxed interpretation, where she wears regularized drapery and Rubens adorns her in that of the state of always being sick and weak. In contrast, no model for the portrait of the Queen's father is known, although it is questioned if he used ideas from one from Paris that, in which he wanted to convey the authoritative appearance of historical figures. Specifically, the statues of Fracesco and Ferdinando de Medici.Millen, pp.24-25 The two portraits are stylistically very different, and even out of place, from the rest of the paintings in the gallery. These paintings of her parents in Marie de' Medici's reception hall look bleak in comparison to the portrait of Marie, where she is looking beautiful if not vain.Millen, p. 25 Although Rubens made great use of allegorical images throughout most of the paintings in the gallery, the two portraits of the Queen's parents are compositionally straightforward and unremarkably executed. Moreover, they are considered to be far from \\"likenesses\\" of either sitter.Millen, pp.23-25 Henry IV Cycle The original commission for the Marie de' Medici cycle included a corresponding gallery illustrating the life of Henry IV that was never completed, although Rubens began work soon after he completed the Marie de' Medici cycle. The Henry cycle called for twenty-four monumental scenes of Henry's life depicting \\"the encounters he was engaged in, his combats, conquests, and sieges of towns with the Triumphs of said victories.\\"Held, p. 123 Marie and Henry's separate wings were designed to meet in an arcade that would unite the two galleries. The paintings of each gallery would have been exhibited as an integrated pair, unifying all forty-eight scenes.Smith, p. 127 It appears that Rubens did not make any sketches for the Henry IV cycle while he was engaged with the first gallery. In one of his letters the artist describes the theme as \\"so large and magnificent that it would suffice for ten galleries\\". Judging by another statement of his on January 27, 1628, he did not engage much in sketching before that date.Held, p. 124 Of the oil sketches executed later by him, only nine survive, along with five large unfinished canvasses. Most of the sketches represent actual battles in which Henry was involved,Sutton and Weiseman, p. 194 such as The Capture of Paris. It is important to note that the reasons for not completing the Henry IV cycle had to do with the current political events of the time. Marie de' Medici was banished from Paris in 1631 as Cardinal Richelieu gained power over Louis XIII.Belkin, p. 192. Consequently, the project was abandoned completely due to approval of the plans for the gallery being repeatedly delayed by the French court. Richelieu, who now had full control of the cycle, refused to speak to Rubens about completing the Henry Gallery based on the falsehood that he was tending to affairs of the state. Richelieu's true motivations were most likely political. During this time, Rubens was in Madrid preparing for a diplomatic mission to London, working towards the rapprochement of Spain and England. The commissioned artist being active in an opposing political parties was cause for Richelieu to object. He was thus actively seeking for an Italian artist to replace Rubens, which resulted in Rubens only sporadically continuing his work. After Marie's banishment in 1631, the project was to be completely abandoned, which seems a travesty seeing as Rubens was very optimistic about the project and its effects on his career; \\"I have now begun the designs of the other gallery which, in my judgment, because of the nature of the subject will prove to be more splendid than the first so that I hope I shall rather gain [in reputation] than decline.\\" The Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre An important sketch from the collection is the so-called Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre ‚Äì a significant event for Henry IV's ascent to the throne. After the death of the duke of Anjou, brother of the childless King Henry III, the apparent heir was to be Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV). However, when a papal bull denied him the throne and excommunicated him, Henry of Navarre protested, starting the War of the Three Henrys. When Henry III was also ostracized from Paris for initiating the murder of the duke of Guise, he met with Henry of Navarre to make peace and recognize him as rightful heir. Although Rubens depicted this reconciliation as taking place in a throne room, contemporary reports recorded that it was actually in a garden full of spectators. The sketch shows Henry of Navarre bowing down in Henry III's presence, which eyewitness accounts confirm was accurate. Rubens represented a putto taking the crown of Henry III, with the intention of placing it on the willing future Henry IV, although the actual transfer of power didn't occur until Henry III's assassination several months later (August 1, 1589). A page stands behind Henry of Navarre holding his personal badge: a white plumed helmet, while the dog at his feet represents fidelity. The two ominous figures behind Henry III most likely represent personifications of Fraud and Discord.Sutton and Wieseman, pp. 194-195 The Henry IV cycle was planned to be composed of scenes from the king's military career. The violence of these images would contrast nicely with the relative peace and regal quality of the scenes in the Marie de' Medici cycle.Smith, p. 131 The Battle of Ivry on the East Wall of the gallery is a scene of Henry's most decisive battle to unify the city of Paris. Primarily gray, the sketch shows the king in crimson velvet to stand out in \\"the most famous of all the battles of Henry IV.\\" He is shown in the center of the scene raising a flaming sword. His victorious army rushes in chaotically behind him; horses rearing and riders falling.Held, p. 127 This painting corresponds to the Coronation painting in the Marie de' Medici cycle. The Triumphal Entry into Paris is the culminating point of the North End of the gallery. Being the king's last major battle fought, this served as an optimal location. Rubens wanted it to be at the end of the gallery as a \\"large and important\\" piece with an advanced state of execution.Held, p. 128 The painting shows Henry parading into Paris as a victorious Roman emperor holding an olive branch, the symbol of peace. However, because Henry never actually entered Paris in this fashion, the scene is supposed to represent only a symbolic triumph. Henry's action and setting (the buildings and a triumphal arch) were not really possible in Paris at this time, reassuring that the scene is not based on historical fact, but a classical metaphor and Henry's goal of remaining King of France.Held, p. 129 This painting coincides with Apotheosis and Ascendancy in the Marie cycle.Smith, p. 132 The Clemency of Henry in Paris corresponds to the Olympian peace scene in the Marie cycle, with Henry's peace as earthly and Marie's as celestial. Henry's painting, beginning the West Wall of the gallery, depicts the scenes following the capture of Paris. Henry's army casts the rebels out of Paris by throwing them over a bridge into the river below. In the left corner, however, the new ruler himself discusses clemency with a few advisers.

Centered on the Russian River, the Russian River Valley AVA accounts for about one-sixth of the total planted vineyard acreage in Sonoma County. The appellation was granted AVA status in 1983 and enlarged in 2005. The area generally lies between Sebastopol and Santa Rosa in the south, and Forestville and Healdsburg in the north. The Russian River Valley has a characteristically cool climate, heavily affected by fog generated by the valley's proximity to the Pacific Ocean. The area is known for its success with cool climate varietals, notably Pinot noir and Chardonnay. Geography and climate A Pinot noir from the Russian River Valley AVA. Despite its name, the Russian River Valley AVA does not cover the entire Russian River Valley-which extends north into Mendocino County, California and southwest all the way to the Pacific Ocean. Originally the river continued south and emptied into San Francisco Bay but during its history, for reasons not yet understood by geologists, the river changed course. The small segment of the river valley that makes up the AVA begins near Healdsburg once the river leaves the Alexander Valley region through a narrow gorge in the foothills of the Mayacamas Mountains. From there it extends south to the Santa Rosa Plains and Sebastopol and west to the towns of Monte Rio, Guerneville and Occidental. Within the boundaries of the Russian River AVA are the sub-AVAs Chalk Hill and Sonoma Green Valley. In 2003 the AVA was expanded to include south of Fulton.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition) pg 482 Dorling Kindersley 2005 The geography of the Russian River Valley was shaped millions of years ago by collisions between the North American and Pacific tectonic plates and eruptions by volcanic vents that deposited volcanic ash over layers of eroded bedrock. This created sandstone of loam known as \\"Goldridge soil\\".Russian River Valley Wine Grower's Association \\"Climate & Geography\\" Accessed: January 25th, 2009 Some of the area's most respected Pinot noir and Chardonnay vineyards are planted along deposits of Goldridge soil. Near the town of Sebastopol, a different soil that is more clay based, known as \\"Sebastopol soil\\" has also shown itself to work well with Pinot noir due to its ability to retain less water than Goldridge soil.J. Morgan \\"The Promised Land\\" Wine Spectator, March 31st 1998 This soil was created by water flowing off the Sonoma Mountains that carried with it clay deposits. A third soil type, found close to the river, is predominately alluvial and makes up the benchland regions of the river. With parts of the AVA located less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Pacific, the climate of the Russian River AVA is characterized by cool morning fog that comes in from the ocean through the Petaluma Gap and burns off during the day.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 671-672 Workman Publishing 2001 The cooling influence of the fog is responsible for the large diurnal temperature variation with nighttime temperatures dropping as much as 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (about 20 ¬∞C) from daytime high. The Russian River is a rain-fed waterway that swells in the wintertime and provides vital irrigation to the region's vineyards during the dry season in late spring. In the summertime, the warmth of the season is tempered by the maritime influence of fog that facilitates a long, slow ripening period and limits the risk of over ripeness or \\"baked\\" flavors in the grapes. Harvest in the Russian River Area often take place at later dates than in its neighboring regions. The central and western reaches of the AVA are the coolest and tend to be most extensively planted with Pinot noir and Chardonnay. The eastern parts of the AVA, located near US 101 and include the sub-AVA of Chalk Hill, are the warmest areas of the Russian River AVA being the furthest away from the ocean. =Boundary disputes= Approximate location of the Russian River Valley AVA along the path of the Russian River. The Russian River AVA has had a number of disputes regarding the expansion and revision of the appellation boundaries. In 1997, the Russian River Winegrowers association attempted to expand the AVA all the way down to the town of Cotati in the southeast corner of Sonoma County. This proposal was rejected by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for being too broad in scope. In 1999, the grower's association filed a new proposal to revise the boundaries based on the influences of coastal fog. Under this proposal the warmer Chalk Hill sub- AVA, which has little fog influence, would be excluded from the Russian River AVA and more acreage along the southwest corner of the AVA would be added.J. Morgan \\"Russian River Vintners Work to Change Appellation Boundaries\\" Wine Spectator, May 18th 1999 That proposal was later rejected as well. In 2003, a new proposal was issued expanding the AVA on the south western end near the Green Valley region.T. Fish \\"Russian River Valley Appellation May Get Bigger -- Or Smaller\\" Wine Spectator, Jan 11th 2003 This expansion was approved later that year. In 2008, E & J Gallo petition for a further expansion of the AVA in the southwestern corner of that would include the winery's Two Rock Vineyard located along the Highway 101 corridor near Cotati in the AVA. If approved, the petition would expand the AVA's total acreage to . When first proposed, the Russian River Winegrowers Association voted unanimously to oppose the expansion on the grounds that the proposed area is climatically different from the rest of the Russian River areas. Gallo contested that opinion and after changes in leadership the grower's associations officially takes a neutral stance on the proposal though some vocal opposition still exist.T. Fish \\"Sonoma Winemakers Clash\\" Wine Spectator, Dec. 31st 2008 As of a meeting of the members on December 9, 2008, the Russian River Winegrowers are opposed the proposed expansion.Letter by Kozlowski/Every, Secretary, http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main?main=DocumentDetail&o;=09000064808144ed History Viticulture in the Russian River region dates back to the 19th century when immigrants from Mediterranean countries descended upon the region and began planting vines. While most vineyards were \\"gardens\\" for personal family consumption, commercial wineries sprung up and by the dawn of the 20th century there were nearly 200 wineries operating. The advent of Prohibition in the United States dealt a devastating blow to the region with many wineries going out of business. Some winemaking families continued to make wine illegally and others converted to bootlegging a sugar and water base wine known as \\"Jackass brandy\\" to survive during this period. (Today one of the most prestigious vineyards in the region is the Jackass Hill Vineyard owned by Martinelli Winery) At the end of Prohibition the few vineyards that were operating would sell their grapes to bulk jug wine producers. It would not be until the 1970s that vineyards in the Russian River region would begin to focus on quality wine production and begin using their grapes for local bottlings. The 1973 vintage of Foppiano Vineyards claims to be the first wines to include the words Russian River on their wine labels. The winery giants of E & J Gallo and Kendall Jackson invested significantly in the region in the late 20th century with Gallo purchasing the large Laguna Ranch vineyard for its flagship \\"premium\\" Chardonnay under its Gallo of Sonoma label in 1970 and purchasing the Twin Valley Ranch once owned by actor Fred MacMurray for its MacMurray Ranch label. Gallo's rival, Kendall Jackson pumped more than $12 million into updating and establishing its La Crema label in the Russian River region. The Freeman Vineyard & Winery was founded in 2001. In 1983, the region was approved for AVA status. Over time the region began to develop a reputation for the quality of its Chardonnay and Pinot Noir for both still and sparkling wine production. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, as the popularity for Pinot Noir grew, the region saw an explosion of investment with Pinot plantings jumping from to over by 2003. Grape varieties Zinfandel An unoaked Chardonnay from the Russian River. According to the trade group Russian River Valley Winegrowers, 42 percent of the grapes harvested in the region are chardonnay, while 29 percent are Pinot noir. While the region is predominately associated with Chardonnay and Pinot noir, hillside vineyard locations have shown success with other varieties such as Syrah and Zinfandel. Within the AVA there are several microclimates that allow for suitable plantings of Sauvignon blanc, Gew√ºrztraminer, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. In warmer areas of Chalk Hill there have been successful plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon. Even for these non-Burgundian varietals, the nature of the Russian River Valley's cool climate can be seen in the wine. For example, Russian River Merlots tend to have distinctive tea-like note and Zinfandels tend to exhibit more tart red fruit than Zinfandels from the warmer Dry Creek AVA. While Sauvignon blanc from the region tend to be slightly less \\"grassy\\" they still tend to exhibit herbal and citrus lime aroma.D. Berger \\"Russian River Valley: Pinot noir Gets Its Dew\\" Appellation America, April 23rd 2008 Despite its close proximity, the Russian River AVA produces Chardonnays that are dramatically different from those found in the Alexander Valley AVA. The region's cool climate produces more grapes with higher acidity that tend to be more balanced than the fatter, creamy style found in the Alexander Valley. Grapes from the Russian River and smaller Green Valley areas have been prized by sparkling wine producers for their crispness and high quality. =Pinot noir= As of 2008, the Russian River Valley accounted for nearly 19% of all the Pinot noir plantings in California and 10% of all grape varieties planted in Sonoma County. Older clones planted in the mid to late 20th century, including the Martini, Swan, Pommard, and 115 clones, produced a \\"classic\\" style of Russian River Pinots that were characterized by vibrant (but pale) color, lively acidity, cherry and berry fruit flavors and delicate aroma that would often include earthy mushroom notes. While that style had it share of fans, the lack of coloring would be a factor in poor score wine ratings from wine critics. In response to these poor scores, some Russian River winemakers altered their techniques in order to enhance the color. These techniques ranged from blending in the darker color Alicante Bouschet and Syrah or the red wine concentrate known as \\"Mega Purple\\", to extended maceration and oak extraction that added more weight and extraction of phenolic compounds that add color to the wine. Other winemakers altered some of their viticultural practices in the vineyards, including adopting new trellising systems that allowed for more leaf removal which exposed the grapes to more sunlight. In addition to enhancing some of the color producing phenols, the new trellising also served to increase sugar content (and subsequently alcohol levels) and decrease the amount of the green tasting pyrazine compounds found in the grapes. The style of Pinot noir produced from these techniques tend to be heavier, more fuller bodied and almost \\"Syrah-like\\".
