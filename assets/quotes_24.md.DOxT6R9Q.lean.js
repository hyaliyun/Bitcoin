Diaz studied dramaturgy and theatre at Havana's Superior Institute of Art (ISA). He started his career as a theatre and art critic and only later took on the role of director. His work is often described as unique and unexpected. History After founding a theatre company called Teatro El Publico in 1992, Diaz's first production billed \\"North American Theatre Trilogy\\" featured two plays by Tennessee Williams (The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire), and one play by Robert Anderson (Tea and Sympathy). His company, which operates out of Trianon Theatre on Calle Linea, has premiered over 40 plays in the last 15 years and has become a Havana institution. His work also includes the short stories \\"The Wolf\\", \\"The Forest and the New Man\\", and \\"Strawberry and Chocolate\\" of Cuban writer Senel Paz, which Diaz developed into plays, emphasizing the sensuality, expressiveness, and Cuban-ness of the stories. The play was then adapted into a film in 1994, starring the same actor Vladimir Cruz. As for plays not written by Cubans, Carlos Diaz tries to work with material that has a certain connection to Cuba. In 1985, at the Ensayo Theatre, and again in 2007 at the El Publico Theatre, Diaz directed the Jean-Paul Sartre play The Respectful Prostitute; Sartre was an early and enthusiastic supporter of the Cuban revolution. Still more Cuban, the production also offered Cuban rum to audience members, and invited them to dance on stage in a conga line at the end of the play. Diaz also directed Federico García Lorca's play The Audience which Lorca began work on in Cuba in 1929. Its opening in Havana in 1994 caused scandal as is portrayed homosexual scandal. Diaz chose to perform the controversial play a second in 1996 and then again in 1998. Despite its Cuban emphasis, El Publico has found success during its trips to Ecuador (1994), Spain (1997), Colombia (1998), and Venezuela (2000). It has also toured throughout Cuba and is currently performing in a temporary location at theatre Adolofo Llayrado Theater on Calle 11, while its usual theatre El Publico is renovated.

He was mayor for several years, and served four terms as a regular representative in the Norwegian Parliament. Career He was born in Granvin as a son of farmers. He spent much of his career as a farmer; from 1863 to 1892. He also worked as a teacher from 1859 to 1866, having taken his education in Voss. He became involved in politics, and was mayor of Ulvik from 1876 to 1888 and 1890 til 1891. Then, when Granvin municipality was created, he was mayor there from 1891 to 1892. He then withdrew from local politics to become bailiff in Vossestrand from 1892 to 1901, and in Ulvik from 1901. Saakvitne also became involved in national politics. He served as a deputy member of the Norwegian Parliament during the term 1880-1882, and was elected as a regular representative in 1883 and 1886. He met regularly in Parliament during his deputy term as well--from April 1880. He belonged to the Liberal Party from its establishment in 1884, and came to adhere to the Pure Liberals (Rene Venstre) fraction following the subsequent party split. As such he turned against the Liberal Prime Minister Johan Sverdrup in 1888. The Pure Liberals were dissatisfied with the composition of Sverdrup's cabinet, and formally asked for a reshuffle in February 1888. Sverdrup interpreted this as a motion of no confidence, but this was irrelevant as the motion was voted down with 51 for and 61 against. Instead, four government ministers of the Pure Liberals (Sofus Arctander, Hans Rasmus Astrup, Birger Kildal, Elias Blix) resigned from the cabinet. Saakvitne left Parliament when his term expired. However, he returned for two non- consecutive terms, from 1898-1900 and 1907-1909\\\\. He represented the constituency Søndre Bergenhus Amt, except for the last term when he represented the single-member constituency Hardanger. He was noted for using his local dialect when speaking in Parliament. In June 1863 Saakvitne married Torbjørg Sjursdatter Nesheim (1844–1933), a farmer's daughter from Granvin. He died in November 1910 in Ulvik, one year after the end of his last parliamentary term.

The company manufactured and sold patient chairs and other health care equipment. In 1876 it was a takeover of the company by Curt Maquet. In 1933 the company relocated to Rastatt, Germany. In 2000 MAQUET was acquired by Getinge Group, leading to the foundation of the business area Medical Systems within the Getinge group. By the beginning of 2008, MAQUET has started into a phase of development into a therapeutic medical company, providing products and services to the OR (Operating Room), ER (Emergency Room), ICU (Intensive Care Unit), NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) of acute care hospitals on a global basis. In 2008 MAQUET acquired US-based Datascope Corporation, which was ranked among the top three global leaders of intra-aortic balloon (IAB) counterpulsation technology. Datascope is a diversified cardiovascular device company that develops, manufactures and markets proprietary products for clinical health care markets in interventional cardiology, cardiovascular and vascular surgery, and critical care. Their products were sold globally through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. Founded in 1964, Datascope is headquartered in Montvale, New Jersey, and maintains a state-of- the-art R&D; facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. On March 12, 2008 Chinese medical device manufacturer Mindray announced that they reached agreement with Datascope to acquire Datascope's patient monitoring business (PMB). The acquisition launched Mindray into the ranks of leading international medical device vendors and created the then third-largest player in the global patient monitoring device industry. Mindray paid Datascope $202 million cash in the transaction. Datascope retained approximately $38 million of receivables generated by the patient monitoring business for a total of $250 million. The Datascope PMB generated $161.3 million in sales in 2007. Mindray expected around $30 million of run-rate synergies in manufacturing, SG&A; and R&D; within 3 years. Mindray retains rights to the Datascope brand until 2015; however, MAQUET, owing to its primary ownership position and acquisition role pertaining to Datascope's other products and services has been conceded, in a special arrangement, to Mindray.

Life =Early years and diaspora= Psalidas was born at 1767 in Ioannina, where he completed ground level education. He continued his studies in Russian Empire (now Ukraine, Poltava) in Slavic Poltava Seminary (1785–1787) and in Austria (1787–1795). In 1791 he published his first work, Real bliss (Αληθής Ευδαιμονία), written in both Greek and Latin. With this work he reestablished fundamental theoretical positions on the existence of God, immortality, afterlife, freedom of man, and the concept of the limits of freedom. During his studies, Psalidas worked in several Greek editorial companies and printing houses that were established in Vienna, notably the newspaper Ephimeris (), published in Vienna since 1791. During the same period he published several books. In 1792, together with the Cypriot Ioannis Karatzas, he published the work Love's results (Έρωτος αποτελέσματα), consisting of three romantic stories. This work was subsequently reprinted five times from 1792 to 1836. In 1793 he was interrogated by the Austrian police as suspect of liberal and pro- French revolutionist. Psalidas denied the charges, but his stay in Vienna was unsafe and decided to return to Ottoman-ruled Greece in 1796. =Schoolmaster in Ioannina= He returned to his native Ioannina, then a prospering city with a large expatriate merchant class and a major cultural center of the Ottoman Greek world. There he became the director of the city's most renowned school, the Maroutsaia School (at that time renamed to Kaplaneios), founded by the bequest of two local merchants, the brothers Lambros and Simon Maroutsis. Psalidas remained at this post for 25 years. During this time he enhanced the school's curriculum by introducing lessons in history, geography, natural sciences, economics and foreign languages. Psalidas also brought with him educational equipment and special instruments in order to teach astronomy and perform a number of chemical and physical experiments. His lessons were not only watched by his students, but also by locals that admired his work. He also equipped the school's library, which was also open to public and hired qualified teaching personnel. Moreover, he offered scholarships to the best of his students. Psalidas had also to deal with conservative circles, who distrusted and bitterly criticized his innovations and promotion of the \\"atheist\\" ideas of Voltaire and many of the ideals of the French Revolution. In refutation of their allegations, he published the work Moves towards progress (Καλοκινήματα). Psalidas had become one of the most distinguished personalities of city of Ioannina. He participated in local courts, councils and was also adviser to Ali Pasha, who also sent him several times to Western Europe in diplomatic missions. =Last years= Title page of Αληθής Ευδαιμονία (Real Bliss) Vienna 1791. Psalidas found refuge in nearby Zagori, when armed conflict between Ali Pasha and the Ottoman Empire broke out (1820–1822).Thereafter he lived in Corfu, where he became doctor of the Ionian Academy, but he was denied the opportunity to teach because of his progressive ideas. Later he became director of the school of Lefkada, where he died, in 1829. Positions on the Greek language question When young, Psalidas adopted an archaist Greek language, but when by the time he had become \\"the most prominent teacher in Ioannina\\" he used Demotic Greek. He also disagreed with the position of Adamantios Korais, on the katharevousa (the \\"purified\\" language, a mix between archaism and demoticism). He is considered one of the possible authors of the anonymous Hellenic Nomarchy: A Discourse on Freedom (Ελληνική Νομαρχία) and Rossaglogallos (Ρωσαγγλογάλλος). Sources *The necessary nation.

History The idea for Maggie's Organics began with an Organic Tortilla chip. The founders worked in the organic food industry, selling both blue and yellow corn tortilla chips, when one of their farmers recommended adding cotton to the crop rotation to improve the quality of the corn. Organic farmers often use crop rotation as a way to improve crop yields without chemicals. His experiment worked. However, his cotton yielded a crop that then became the possession of the founders who had no venue to sell it.Janet Miller.

He was born in Dniprodzerzhynsk. He made his professional debut in the Soviet Second League B in 1991 for FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih. Biography Popovych was a trainee of the sport academy of Mettalurg from Dniprodzerzhynsk. He was playing for various teams at the early stage of his career including Prometei (1990), Kryvbas (1991–1994), Zirka (1994–1995), Shakhtar (1995–1996). In 1997, he moved to Russia, where he started to play for Zenit from Saint Petersburg, where he performed more than 100 caps and scored 41 goal. Together with \\"Zenit\\" he reached a peak of his career. In 2000, he scored two goals in the final of Intertoto Cup against Celta. Popovych himself later recalled these times as the happiest period in his life and also during professional career. In 2001 Popovych won the bronze medal of Russian championship with Zenit also being the first sniper of the team in the season of 2001. In autumn of 2001 Popovich felt sick while season was not yet finished. Later on, he noted that his conditions get worsened at every new training. In the end of 2001 according to strong recommendation from medics, he finished his football career due to the problems with heart (two consecutive infarcts of pulmonary and heart systems respectively). Former chief doctor of Zenit, Mikhail Grishin later mentioned this period in Popovych's life pointing out that \\"Popovych could not live without football, how could you stop him from doing it?\\". Between 2002 and 2005 he was working as an administrator of Zenit. Between 2005 and 2008 he was a coach of Zenit youth team. In 2009 Popovych became a coach of Zenit Academy and since 2010 youth team of Lokomotiv. In his spare time he liked playing hockey and fishing. Popovych died on 4 June 2010 after a heart attack. 4 days after the visitation was organized at the Petrovskiy Stadium. He was buried at Smolensky Cemetery in Saint Petersburg. For Zenit and St. Petersburg in general, Popovych has remained one of the most prominent players for pre-Gazprom (before 2006) Zenit history. According to Andrey Arshavin, Popovych was the only example of a physically powerful center forward (classic number nine) who has successfully adapted to traditionally high-speed play style of Zenit. Despite Popovych has never succeeded to become a crucial member of Ukrainian national football team, Valeriy Lobanovskiy appreciated the style of Popovych and staked hopes on him in the beginning of 21st century. By some unofficial estimates, Popovych is often recognized as one of the most impactful Ukrainian players who ever played football in post-Soviet Russia. In January 2011 in the youth sport complex Zenit the tournament in the name of Popovych was organized. In June 2012 on the Petrovskiy Stadium Zenit fans opened the memorial tablet dedicated to Popovych. In popular culture Saint Petersburg band \\"Bivny\\" mentioned Popovich in their song \\"Forwards\\" (\\"Форварды\\" in Russian).

Tom’s mother, Elizabeth, graduated from the University of Houston and became a social worker. His father, Bill, served in World War II as a First Lieutenant in Patton's Army 4th Armored Division, Engineering Corp. Following the war, Bill owned a service station, a construction company, and was a top salesman for Gibraltar Mausoleum Co.

After graduating high school in 1964, he received a Congressional appointment to West Point as a First Alternate. When the primary appointee failed his physical, Gegax successfully passed his own physical and was preparing for admission to the military academy when he was informed that the primary appointee’s failed physical had been waived.

Gegax served as Chairman and CEO (Head Coach) and was able to bypass outside investors over the years by tightly managing his company. In 2000, as the company’s majority shareholder, Gegax sold Tires Plus to Bridgestone/Firestone and currently serves as Chairman Emeritus.

In 1989, at the age of 43, a bout with cancer caused him to refine his diet even further to focus on organic, natural, whole, plant- based food and occasional fish. Gegax’s long-time interest in healthy living motivated his implementation of wellness programs at Tires Plus and inspired his interest and involvement in environmental advocacy. =Board of Directors’ Service, Keynote Speeches, & Consulting Clients= Tom’s extensive Board of Directors’ service includes several health and environmental organizations such as the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, Deepak Chopra Enterprises, John Robbins’ EarthSave, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s Waterkeeper Alliance, Dan Buettner (Blue Zones) and Chairman at Center For Science in the Public Interest, an organization that has always been at the forefront of health (organic standards, food labeling).

Surmelian moved to America in 1922, and authored three major works throughout his lifetime. A survivor of the Armenian Genocide, Surmelian published his first English book, I Ask You, Ladies and Gentlemen in 1945. He is also well known for translating the Armenian epic Daredevils of Sassoun (\\"Sasna Dzrer\\") into English. Early life Leon Surmelian was born on November 24, 1905, in Trabzon, Trebizond Vilayet, Ottoman Empire to pharmacist Garabed Surmelian and Zvart Diradurian. Surmelian, the third of four children, had two sisters and a brother. Surmelian has noted that his father strongly supported Armenian-Turkish friendship, and was the only Armenian in Trabzon critical of Russia. His uncle, also named Leon, was a member of the Dashnak Armenian Revolutionary Federation while he was growing up. In 1915, during the Armenian Genocide, Surmelian lost both of his parents, but was adopted, along with his three siblings, by a Greek doctor who was a family-friend at the time. In 1916, eleven-year-old Surmelian boarded a Russian ship to Batumi, then Krasnodar. In 1918, after an armistice during the First World War, Surmelian arrived in Constantinople with a group of friends and later attended the Armash Farming School in Armash. After a brief year in Armenia, he returned to Constantinople and lived in an orphanage whilst he attended religious school. At the age of 16, he served as the assistant secretary to the Commissariat of the Interior. In 1922, the Armenian Union of Agriculture helped Surmelian move to America, where he earned his Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Administration degree from Kansas State University.  Career  Monastery of Armash, Ottoman ArmeniaSurmelian originally wanted to study agriculture in America to go back and reconstruct Armenia. Although he thought poetry wasn't the right way to carry out the task of helping one's country, he later described himself as an \\"engineer of the soul, just as in demand as a regular engineer in times of crisis.\\" His writing can be traced back to 1920, when he met Vahan Tekeyan, an Armenian poet, at the amphitheater of the Armenian Central School in Istanbul. Tekeyan was the editor of The People's Voice, a publication in Istanbul, and offered to edit and publish Surmelian's poems. In 1924, Surmelian collected his various poems and published his first and only Armenian work, Joyous Light (Lus Zvart), in Paris, France. From 1931 to 1932, Surmelian served as the editor of the first Armenian-American weekly paper in English, the Armenian Messenger. In 1937, Surmelian naturalized as an American citizen, and then went to work at the Los Angeles County Department of Probation from 1943 to 1944. He also briefly wrote as a screenwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios from 1944 to 1945. In 1945, Surmelian published I Ask You, Ladies and Gentlemen, an autobiography of his life during the Armenian Genocide in English which would later be translated into Italian, Swedish, Czech, and Turkish. In 1950, he published a collection of short stories titled 98.6°, which was followed by a collection of Armenian folktales retold through Surmelian's voice titled Apples of Immortality: Folktales of Armenia in 1958. Surmelian then went to translate the Armenian national epic Daredevils of Sassoun into English in 1964. Both Apples of Immortality and Daredevils of Sassoun are considered to be important pieces of the Armenian people's literary works and are included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Whilst working on Apples of Immortality and Daredevils of Sassoun, Surmelian was simultaneously lecturing at the University of Southern California and continued to do so until 1969. In 1969, he published his last work Techniques of Fiction Writing: Measure and Madness, an educational book on modern fiction works. Surmelian died on October 3, 1995https://newspaperarchive.com/leon-surmelian-obituary-281447000/ and was buried in Forest Lawn Mortuary, in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, California.https://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-06/local/me-53820_1_san- fernando-mortuary  Works  A Turkish copy of I Ask You, Ladies and Gentlemen Joyous Light, Surmelian's first and only work in Armenian published in 1924, was well received globally. At just 19, Surmelian won praise from the Armenian community worldwide. The cover of the I Ask You, Ladies and Gentlemen, published by the Armenian Institute Surmelian's autobiography on the Armenian Genocide and first work in English, I Ask You, Ladies and Gentlemen, was also praised internationally and was eventually translated into multiple languages after its initial publication in 1945. The book was republished by the Armenian Institute in London in 2018 with added photographs, a map and glossary. Apples of Immortality, published by the University of California Press in 1968, presented 40 Armenian folktales that, according to Surmelian, \\"only needed a little trimming and stitching\\" to make the book comprehensible to the non-Armenian. The 319-page book received mixed reviews and was praised for its artistic insight into the ways and beliefs of the Armenian people. Surmelian's rendition of the folktales included narratives where Armenian men had two brides, which critics found to be inaccurate given that Armenian women are traditionally monogamous. The folktales, illustrated by Stewart Irwin, were compared to similar English stories, one critic noting that the book had an Armenian equivalent for every tale including an Armenian Cinderella variant. Daredevils of Sassoun, Surmelian's 280-page recreation of the Armenian epic based on village oral traditions, was published in 1964. The novel, illustrated by Paul Sagsoorian and described as Homeric, begins with a 25-page introduction and follows with four sagas titled Sanasar and Balthasar, Great Meherr, Splendid David, and Meherr Junior that largely explore the conflicts of Christian warriors with Islam. The book received critical acclaim for its ability to retain the poetic qualities, metaphors, images, and rhetoric of the reciters without depending on lyrical song to retain the reader's interest. Critics comment that the book is characterized by uneven style, repetitions, great narrative leaps, and detailed conversations existing side by side with summary descriptions of the actions. Surmelian's last book, published in 1969, Techniques of Fiction Writing: Measure and Madness, tackles modern fiction writing using examples from Flaubert, Joyce, Dostoevsky, and Hemingway. The book is widely available online, and still used in classrooms today.  Influences  After his first work, Joyous Light, Surmelian abandoned writing in Armenian and only wrote in English. At the same time, Surmelian changed his first name from 'Levon' to 'Leon', dropping the 'v' associated with the Armenian name. Noubar Aghishian, another Armenian-American author based in California, defended Surmelian's choice to not write in his mother tongue, asking his audience \\"who even reads Armenian books today?\\" Vahan Tekeyan, who helped Surmelian edit his Joyous Light poems, often exchanged letters with Surmelian. The two were close, and Surmelian, who later published the letters, explains that Tekeyan was an early mentor and left a great impression on his later writings. In his letters with Tekeyan, Surmelian said that mastering two languages, Armenian and English, would not be feasible and so he chose to write in English after publishing Joyous Light as he felt that his future works would be more impactful if read by a larger audience. Even though he no longer wrote in his mother tongue, his works were still published in various English-language literary journals throughout his lifetime. For his mixed depiction of Armenian women in Daredevils of Sassoun, Greek critic Kyriacos Hadjioannou argued that Surmelian had a subtle Muslim influence in his writings. Surmelian himself says that Austrian-Bohemian author Franz Werfel and fellow Armenian-American writer William Saroyan inspired him to tell the Armenian story in a different language. Saroyan would later go on to write the introduction to Surmelian's I Ask You, Ladies and Gentlemen, and Surmelian would eventually go on to be known as the most widely read Armenian-American author after Saroyan.

The band, which is often compared to Dilated Peoples and The Amorphous, won the Alamar rap Festival's Grand Prize in 1996. History Doble Filo is Spanish for “double-edged”, with reference to blades but also metaphors. Their sound is described as experimental hip-hop with a feel-good vibe. Although not all members originate from the Alamar area of La Havana, the epicentre of Cuban hip-hop, their presence there is significant. The group shares credit with fellow Cuban hip-hop artists Obsession for starting the multidisciplinary art collective La Fabrik. They won the grand prize at the 1996 Alamar Rap Festival. Many of their songs are composed in an Alamar building called “Laboratorio 675”. Their main musical philosophy is avoiding negativity. Their most recent album is Despierta (\\"Wake Up\\"), not yet released by a record label. Gonzales and Saenz will be making a record called Rayones de Mi Album.

The buildings on one side were known as Hankow Barracks, and the other Nanking Barracks. There was a large parade ground. Smaller buildings were later added, and the large Jubilee Buildings were constructed as married quarters. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army used it as a POW camp for British, Indian and Canadian soldiers. This was the main POW Camp in Hong Kong, operating from before the British surrendered the Colony, to the Japanese surrender. By the latter date, it was the only POW facility operating in Hong Kong, bar the hospital at the Central British School (now King George V School). Many POWs died here, especially in the diphtheria epidemic of 1942, and all shipments of POWs to Japan left from Sham Shui Po's Bamboo Pier. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the camp was used to house Vietnamese refugees. The camp was re-developed for housing in the early 1990s. None of the former military structures exists and only plaques commemorating the POW camp remain, together with maple trees commemorating the Canadians held here.

The village is situated on the road between Chania and the plateau of Omalos which leads to the Samaria Gorge. Geography Lakkoi is 450 metres high, below the White Mountains which rise another 1,000 metres to the south. Most of the houses cling to steep slopes covered in olive and chestnut trees, reached through narrow roads or tracks that run down from the main square. The climate is cool in winter, with occasional snow, wet in spring, hot and dry in the summer. In the unusually dry summer of 2007, major brush fires broke out twice, burning about and threatening the village itself. Economy Street in Lakkoi Traditionally the villagers have cultivated olives and raised goats, sheep and chickens. With limited work opportunities, the population has declined from a peak of around 2,000 to 212 (2011 census). There are signs of growth as houses are being purchased and renovated by citizens of other European Union countries seeking low-cost retirement or vacation homes. History The first historical mention of the village dates from 1263, when the Lakkoi chieftain Pentachtenis took part in a revolt against the Venetians. In a later revolt in 1570 the chieftain George Mousouris became Secretary General of the rebel forces, based in the nearby village of Meskla. After the Ottoman conquest of the island, the people of Lakkoi were involved in periodic revolts, notably the revolt of 1821-1828 during the Greek War of Independence, where an Ottoman army of 5,000 men led by Latif Pasha of Chania was routed in a pitched battle at Lakki. In the great rebellion of 1866-1869 Katerina Stamataki of Lakkoi was a distinguished woman revolutionary.A.

He served as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food from 2008 to 2014.Special Rapporteur on the right to food, OHCHR He is a Professor of international human rights law, European Union law and legal theory at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, as well as at the College of Europe and at Sciences Po in Paris. He was a regular visiting professor at Columbia University between 2008 and 2012 and has regularly contributed to the American University Washington College of Law's Academy on Human Rights and Humanitarian Law. He is the first chair of the Belgian Advisory Council on Policy Coherence for Development and he co-chairs the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food) , a group of experts from various disciplines and regions who work together towards developing proposals for food systems reform. A Member of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights between 2015 and 2020, he was appointed the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights , and took up his functions on May 1st, 2020. Background The son of a diplomat, his primary and high school education took place in Bombay (now Mumbai), India; Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; and Kigali, Rwanda. He studied law at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain), Panthéon-Assas University and Harvard University, before obtaining a Ph.D. from the UCLouvain. His doctoral thesis, a comparative study of the role of courts in fundamental rights adjudication, was published in French as Fonction de juger et droits fondamentaux. Transformation du contrôle juridictionnel dans les ordres juridiques américain et européens, Bruxelles, Bruylant, 1999, 1164 pp. His subsequent publications are in the areas of governance and human rights, with a particular focus on the issue of globalization and human rights and economic and social rights more generally, and on the protection of fundamental rights in the European Union. Among his books on human rights are International Human Rights Law. Cases, Materials, Commentary, initially published by Cambridge University Press in 2010 and which went through a second, revised edition in 2014. He also published extensively on economic globalization and human rights, most notably advocating in favor of improving linkages between trade policies and labour rights and environmental standards (Trade in the Service of Sustainable Development, Hart/Bloomsbury, 2015) and making proposals for a more sustainable and democratic governance of natural resources, such as land and water (Governing Access to Essential Resources, Columbia Univ. Press, 2016, co-edited with K. Pistor; and Foreign Direct Investment and Human Development, Routledge, 2012, co-edited with J.F. Swinnen and J. Wouters). In his work, he seeks to link the human rights principles of participation, accountability, and non-discrimination, with the idea of learning-based public policies, that are permanently tested and revised in the light of their impact on the poorest and most vulnerable. His current work focuses on transition towards sustainable societies, in which he mobilizes various disciplines including economics, social psychology, political science, and feminist theory. Since the mid-1990s, Olivier De Schutter has been involved in various capacities in the debates on improving governance in the EU, and on fundamental rights in the EU. In 1995–1997, he co-organized a seminar on reforming governance in the EU with the Forward Studies Unit of the European Commission, a seminar that later, following the fall of the Santer Commission, was influential in shaping the White Paper on Governance published in July 2001 by the European Commission. Between 2002 and 2007, he coordinated the EU Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights, a high-level group of experts established at the request of the European Parliament to provide recommendations to the EU institutions on the implementation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and to report on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU. In 2013, he was appointed a member of the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency's Scientific Committee. His key proposals for the introduction of a learning-based governance in the EU, building on local social innovations to accelerate the shift to sustainable societies and thus to support the ecological and social transition, are summarized in a report he presented at the 2014 International Francqui Conference . His views were strongly influenced by democratic experimentalism, as promoted by Roberto M. Unger, a Harvard Law School professor under whom De Schutter studied, and Charles F. Sabel, a Columbia Law School colleague with whom he co-taught a seminar on governance in the EU during a few years. To democratic experimentalism as exposed by Unger or Sabel, De Schutter adds an emphasis on social innovations originating within communities in which sufficient social capital is present to allow for collective action to develop. In that sense, sociodiversity—the proliferation of social innovations, often at local level and linked to local resources and motivations—is seen as a key asset to build resilient and sustainable societies, and governance should support such innovations. The implication is a radical view about democracy: rather than democracy being just a characteristic of the political system, it should be a characteristic of society as a whole, and rather than democracy being about the \\"People\\" electing representatives to design solutions for them, it should mean creating space for people to invent their own solutions to surmount the obstacles they face. This view also permeates his interpretation of food sovereignty, as being primarily about food democracy and the ability for people to invent alternatives to the mainstream food system . It also guides his role within IPES-Food, the International Panel of Experts on sustainable food systems : IPES-Food seeks to develop proposals for food systems reform by involving social actors and building on social innovations, in a transdisciplinary demarche that unlocks obstacles to reform by democratizing food systems and squarely addressing political economy issues delaying change—vested interests, dominant narratives, and economic and political monopolies. He is also a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. United Nations Special Rapporteur As the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, De Schutter presented reports to the UN Human Rights Council and to the UN General Assembly on various aspects of the right to food. He also conducts official visits that lead to reports being prepared to the attention of the governments concerned and to the international community: such missions took place, inter alia, in Benin, Brazil, Cameroon, China, Guatemala, Madagascar, Mexico, Nicaragua, South Africa and Syria. Although he worked mainly in developing countries, he also took interest in advanced economies such as Canada, conducting an 11-day formal investigation in Canada during 2012. As Special Rapporteur he has released official reports on agroecology, nutrition, contract farming, fisheries, gender and other key issues tied to securing the right to food, and throughout has advocated the need for smallholder farmers to be at the centre of food security strategies and urged countries to reinvest in their agricultural sectors rather than rely on imports from volatile world markets. He has also been critical of large-scale land acquisitions and biofuel production in food insecure countries. A summary of his conclusions is provided in his final report to the UN Human Rights Council . In his capacity of UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Olivier De Schutter announced his intention to focus on the inter-generational transmission of poverty and on discrimination against people in poverty and insufficient investment in early childhood as key factors explaining the perpetuation of poverty. He also works extensively on the obstacles to the adoption by all countries of social protection floors, advocating since 2012 on the need to establishing a new international financing facility to that effect, called the Global Fund for Social Protection . De Schutter is featured in Marie-Monique Robins 2012 documentary Crops of the Future, where his encouraging study of agro-ecology and the solutions to our planet's food crisis is presented. Between 2015 and 2020, Olivier De Schutter was a member of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, an expert body tasked with the supervision of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee meets for three sessions each year, receiving country reports and assessing individual communications under an Optional Protocol that entered into force in May 2013.  International Federation for Human Rights  Before being appointed the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, De Schutter was the General Secretary of the International Federation for Human Rights, and international human rights non- governmental organisation based in Paris focused on the issue of globalization and human rights (2004–2008).  Distinctions  In 2013, Olivier De Schutter was awarded the prestigious Francqui Prize, in recognition of his contributions to the theory of governance, EU law, and international and European human rights law. He was awarded the James Beard Foundation Leadership Award in 2018, for his work on food systems reform.

It is fed by the Sturgeon Swamp and Mussel Swamp, lowlands near US Route 360 on the Middle Peninsula, and empties into the Rappahannock River three miles (5 km) downstream from the town of Tappahannock. It is tidal for much of its course. The creek drains an area of . Its watershed is 63% forested. Agriculture encompasses 26.5 percent of the watershed, with 16.1 percent cropland and 10.4 pasture/hayland. The remainder consists of swampland and residential area.Piscataway Creek Environmental Assessment Description Piscataway Creek follows a winding path through the central part of Essex county. It is navigable for about four miles (6 km) upstream from the Rappahannock river. The navigable portion extends just beyond the US Route 17 bridge. There are no aids to navigation. In 1883, the United States government considered improving the navigability of the creek to serve the agricultural and foresting interests of the area. The channel was found to be narrow, but deep enough to support commercial vessels. The major inhibitor to commercial navigation was the bar extending across the northern portion of the mouth of the creek. It was ultimately decided that improved access was not worth the cost of dredging, and goods continued to be taken to Ware's Wharf via wagon.Annual Report of the Secretary of War, pp 1006-07 The Tappahannock-Essex County Airport, opened in 2007, sits in the southern portion of the Piscataway's watershed.

At seventeen he moved to Tokyo with hopes jumping on a ship to America, but he ended up working there for a few years instead. During this time he became devout Christian and then came to America as a student in 1885, like several other initial Japanese immigrants. A decade later, Abiko became a somewhat of a successful businessman and began his personal mission to aid other fellow Japanese in settling in the United States. In 1899 his news paper entitled Nichibei Shimbun became the most prominent Japanese newspaper. The paper took on issues such as restrictions on Japanese immigration and education discrimination. Abiko’s paper not only helped publicize issues important to Japanese Americans, but it also created ties among newly formed Japanese communities. As Abiko became a prominent leader in the Japanese American community, he formed three new colonies: Yamato Colony in Livingston in 1907, Cressey in 1918, and Cortez in 1919.Matsumoto, V: \\"Farming the Home Place: A Japanese American Community in California, 1919-1982\\", page 40-50. Cornell University Press, 1994.  Legal loopholes  When Cortez was founded in 1919, another piece (in a long history) of anti-Japanese legislation had been passed in the United States. The Alien Land Act of 1913 prevented all ‘aliens illegible for citizenship’ from owning land or leasing property for more than three years. This act was a direct attempt to prevent Japanese farmers from owning land and therefore accumulating wealth in their names. Options for social mobility became limited. The farmers of the Abiko colonies were fortunate compared to many other Japanese; they were farm owners in addition to being farm laborers. In order to circumvent this law, many Japanese out their farm’s land in the name of their Nisei American born children. Families were able to turn barren uncultivated land into thriving farms through hard work ethic and by running a family economy. It was normative for all members of a family, including children would work on the farm.Adachi, K: \\"The Enemy That Never Was\\", page 152-153. McClelland & Steward Inc., 1991.

Finnemore contributed stories to popular boys' magazines of his time such as The Boy's Own Paper and Boys' Realm but he is best remembered for his books about Teddy Lester and his friends at Slapton, a fictitious English public school.Benjamin Watson, English Schoolboy Stories: An Annotated Bibliography Rowman & Littlefield, 1992, pages 50-51 The stories have a strong sporting focus, with Lester excelling at rugby, cricket and other games. He also wrote a few adult novels. Finnemore was also a writer of early Boy Scout fiction. Biography There is no existing documentation of Finnemore's life and the following account has been constructed from returns of the Census in the United Kingdom and official Birth, Marriage and Death records held at the General Register Office (GRO) for England and Wales. John was born in the third quarter of 1863GRO reference: District Birmingham (1837-1924) volume 6d page 169 at Birmingham, England. His father, William worked in the Birmingham pen trade and his elder brother was the artist Joseph Finnemore. John's mother, Charlotte died in 1878 when he was 15 years of age and his father did not marry again. The family must have been reasonably wealthy and as a result John received a good education because at the age of 17 he was already working as a school teacher. Five years later he married Eliza Emily Pearson who was the same age as him and was also a teacher at 17. Eliza came from a Northampton family which had resettled in Birmingham before she was 7 years of age. After her marriage Eliza dropped her first name and retained her maiden surname to become Emily Pearson Finnemore. She became an author of mainly religious works published by the Christian Knowledge Society (now known as SPCK).The on-line catalogue at the British Library lists 19 works. 11 were published by the Christian Society and one book, \\"From a Welsh Hillside\\" was written jointly with her husband John There were no children from the marriage. The 1881 Census shows Finnemore living at the family home at Aston, Birmingham but 10 years later he is found living with Emily at the small hamlet of Little Bealings in Suffolk where his occupation is shown as a schoolmaster. 10 years later the couple are found living in Wales in the village of Blaenpennal in Cardiganshire. The 1891 Welsh Census shows that John was a speaker of the Welsh language which, no doubt, was an essential skill he had to acquire since again his occupation is shown to be a \\"schoolmaster and author\\". The biography of T. Hughes Jones (1895–1966) records the fact that Jones attended the Tan-y-garreg elementary school, Blaenpennal, where his schoolteacher until 1903 was John Finnemore. It is around this time that Finnemore's first published works start to appear. During the following ten- year period he became a prolific writer with several books published each year and during that time he must have become quite wealthy. This is evidenced by the 1911 Census showing John and Emily living together with their cook and housemaid in a 15-room house at Llanfarian, Aberystwyth some 12 miles from Blaenpennal. Finnemore died on 17 December 1915 of heart failure aged 52.GRO reference: District Aberystwyth volume 11b page 77 Four days later he was buried at the Anglican church of St. Llwchaearn at Llanychaearn a few miles from his home.National Burial Index record provided by Cardiganshire Family History Society Selected works =Teddy Lester Series= *Three School Chums (London, W. & R.

It was called RAF Castel Benito by the Allies after 1943. History Originally, it was a small military airport, but it was enlarged in the late 1930s (and was later used by the British RAF after 1943). =Castel Benito aeroporto= Originally, Tripoli-Castel Benito Airport was a Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) airfield created in 1934 in the southern outskirts of Italian Tripoli. It was the operational base for the \\"15° Stormo da bombardamento\\" with Savoia Marchetti SM. 79 and SM.81 as well as the \\"13° Gruppo da caccia\\" with Fiat CR.32 and CR.42. Later, the first units of Italian parachutists were trained and formed shortly before the Second World War. The first Italian Military Parachute School was at the airport. The first troops trained were two Libyan battalions, the Libyan Parachute Battalion and the 1st National Libyan Parachute Battalion,[3] of the Royal Colonial Corps. Successively was created a paratrooper battalion with Italian volunteers, that later was increased and named Folgore. In 1938, the Italian Libya governor Italo Balbo enlarged the military airfield (located 33 km south of Tripoli) and created an international airport for civilians served mainly by Ala Littoria, the official Italian airline: the Aeroporto di Tripoli-Castel Benito. The airport was connected to Rome by the \\"Linee Aeree Transcontinentali Italiane\\" (LATI), that ran a postal (and civilian service) to Africa, Asia and South America from Italy. The new airport had direct flights to Tunis and Malta, run with Savoia-Marchetti SM-73 of \\"Ala littoria\\". Castel Benito airport was connected with internal airports of Libya, such as Benghazi (Benina International Airport), Ghadames (Ghadames Airport), Sabha (Sabha Air Base), and Kufra (Kufra Airport). Another flight served by \\"Ala Littoria\\" was towards the Africa Orientale Italiana, with more than 4000 km: it was used mainly for military transport and mail service and was created in 1935, from Tripoli to Kassala (Sudan) and Asmara in Italian Eritrea. It was served by the Caproni Ca.308 Borea, with capacity for a crew of 2 but with only 6 passengers.[7] In 1938 Air France started a regular flight from Marseille to Tripoli, later enlarged to Benghazi and Damascus. In 1938 the Ala Littoria's international flights from the new civilian airport were: *Roma - Malta - Tripoli *Roma - Tunisi - Tripoli *Roma - Tripoli - Benghazi In spring 1939 was started a flight to Eritrea, Ethiopia ad Somalia: Roma -Tripoli (Benghazi)- Cairo - Khartoum - Asmara - Addis Ababa - Mogadishu (nearly 7000 km) In 1939 was started by Ala Littoria a passenger service with international travels to Rome (Italy) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia and Africa Orientale Italiana): it was one of the first intercontinental flights in world history and was called Linea dell'Impero. The service was done (using mainly the Benghazi airport, but even the Tripoli-Castel Benito airport) with Savoia-Marchetti SM-83 carrying nearly 30 passengers. In summer 1939 was experimented the possibility of direct flights between Libya and Eritrea, bypassing Egypt and Sudan controlled by the British Empire. The son of Mussolini, an experienced aviator, was able to make a direct flight from Castel Benito airport to Kufra airport (near the desert border Libya-Sudan) and to Asmara in Italian Eritrea: this new route was used by military airplanes after WWII started. In 1939, more and more attracted by the idea of establishing a similar regular service between Italy and Italian East Africa, Bruno Mussolini (in the meantime appointed general manager of LATI) and his staff carried out a long technical cruise with their SM83-ATTE to Tripoli and the Kufra Oasis (Libya), Asmara, Massaua, Gura and Agordat (Eritrea). The voyage proved to be very useful to acknowledge those flight experiences necessary for the future war missions. The airport was used even as a military base, where some Savoia-Marchetti SM-74 operated successfully even as civilian transport airplanes. The last of these airplanes, nicknamed \\"Millepiedi\\", did the last flight to Italy from Tripoli-Castel Benito airport on January 7, 1943Rosselli, Alberto. \\"The air links between Italy and Eastern Africa\\". Section: The debut of the Transatlantic SM83 before the arrival of the British Army (that fully destroyed the airport and conquered Tripoli on January 23). The airport during WWII suffered huge damages and was attacked continuously by Allied bombers. The most destructive raids were on November/December 1941 and in December 1942/January 1943. =RAF Castel Benito= The Castel Benito airport was in activity and used by the Italians from early 1930s until 1943. After the airport was captured by the British in January 1943, the airfield was renamed RAF Castel Benito and was used by a number of Allied operational squadrons involved in the desert war and in the Tunisia battles.

R. F. Keating. It is the twentieth novel in the Inspector Ghote series and the twenty-second book, due to the publication of two short story collections. Plot introduction Inspector Ghote is ordered to investigate a case of drug smuggling at the Mira Behn Institute for Medical Research. Ghote's chief suspect is Chandra Chagoo, the snake handler, but unfortunately Chagoo himself is dead, the victim of a deadly Russell's viper. Inspector Ghote knows this was no accident, but the only way he will get answers is through asking a lot of awkward questions. Plot summary The novel is prefaced by a section entitled \\"Questions\\", which consists of four passages numbered in Roman numerals. I Chandra Chagoo is threatened by Abdul Khan, who believes Chagoo has been asking questions in order to gather evidence for the police. II Dr Gauri Subbiah contemplates confronting Chagoo and demanding exactly what he knows about her past. She fears he knows everything. III Dr Ram Mahipal lectures a class of medical students about the importance of asking questions. Privately he contemplates imminent professional ruin for asking the wrong question. IV Professor Phaterpaker also contemplates professional ruin as a result of Ram Mahipal's question, the answer to which Chagoo already knows. The preface ends. The main body of the novel begins with the heading: Answer The Commissioner tells Ghote that a criminal named Abdul Khan has supplied Bombay film stars with drugs from the Mira Behn Institute. Ghote is ordered to find who stole drugs from the institute and arrest them under a false charge to prevent a scandal. Ghote tells the Commissioner that he recently caught an airline stewardess, Nicky D'Costa, smuggling drugs for Abdul Khan. The Commissioner says he will assign another officer to manage Nicky D'Costa as an informant and that it will take a better officer than Ghote to bring Abdul Khan to justice. Ghote questions Asha Rani, a movie star. Her \\"friend\\" Mr Ganguly took a sample of a medicine called A.C.E. and nearly died. Khan, who also supplied Mr Ganguly with cocaine, supplied the A.C.E. At the institute, Ghote interviews Professor Phaterpaker. The Professor says he will go to any lengths to protect the institute. The institution's work is largely concerned with making new medicines from the venom of poisonous snakes. Dr Subbiah immediately suspects Chandra Chagoo of having stolen the A.C.E. and leads Ghote to the reptile room. When the door is unlocked they find Chagoo dead with a Russell's viper loose in the room. The next day the Commissioner assigns Ghote to investigate Chagoo's death to prevent the scandal being exposed by another officer. Ghote realises that Chagoo did not have a key to lock the reptile room door and must have been murdered. Ghote interviews Dr Ram Mahipal, who left a reptile-room key in his old office at the institute when he suddenly quit his job. Ghote learns from the building manager that Mahipal returned in order to access his computer files on the night Chagoo died. Dr Subbiah, Professor Phaterpaker, Dr Mahipal and the building manager were all in the building at the time. Ghote suspects that the murderer may be an employee at the nearby hospital. He enlists the inspector originally assigned to Chagoo's death to test this theory. On their next meeting Mahipal says he returned to teaching in hopes of instilling integrity in young medical students. Mahipal left the institute because he believed that Phaterpaker faked results, possibly on a regular basis. Phaterpaker takes the news that Chagoo was murdered calmly, remarking that Mahipal was slipshod and implying that he was dismissed for this. Ghote tries to determine exactly why Mahipal left, but Phaterpaker is vague. When Phaterpaker realises he himself is a suspect, he is affronted but admits \\"cutting corners\\" and acts like a man with something to hide. Ghote concludes that Phaterpaker is trying to use Mahipal as a scapegoat to protect the institute. Dr Subbiah reacts badly when asked about her relations with Chagoo, however Ghote concludes she is not the killer. Ghote discovers that Dr Mahipal's father works as a cook at the medical school and is a Brahmin, whereas Mahipal claims to be a member of the Dalit caste. Ghote deduces that Mahipal misrepresented himself in order to get a university scholarship reserved for the lower classes. Mahipal confesses this is so. Ghote suggests Chagoo came to learn Mahipal's secret and was murdered because of this. Mahipal denies this and reveals that he left the institute because Phaterpaker was removing lab animals that gave undesirable results. At the police station, Ghote is dismayed when the inspector he is working with points out one of the three scientists must surely hang for the crime and expresses a preference that it be Dr Subbiah. At the institute Ghote accuses Phaterpaker of falsifying test results. Phaterpaker confesses his results are fake. He became aware that Chagoo was stealing drugs from the institute but was forced to agree to a truce because Chagoo knew Phaterpaker was removing lab animals. Ghote considers the reptile room and realises wooden stool must have been used to break the glass, so he decides to have it dusted for fingerprints. At the police station Ghote learns that Nicky D'Costa has murdered, her throat slit after asking too many questions of Abdul Khan. Ghote is angry enough to confront the commissioner, but learns Khan had arranged to be in hospital during the murder. The forensic tests do not find a match between any fingerprints on the stool and Ghote's three suspects. Nor can they prove it was used to break the glass of the viper's cage. Ghote goes home and argues with his wife, then inspiration strikes and he returns to the institute. There he searches the grounds for evidence someone could gain access by night. The security guard catches Ghote and he must call his fellow inspector to rescue him. Afterwards Ghote chances upon Dr Subbiah. Ghote deduces that Phaterpaker persuaded her to \\"anticipate\\" the results of her experiments, as Phaterpaker himself was once persuaded. The conversation between Ghote and Subbiah is interrupted when, by chance, they pass the funeral of Nicky D'Costa. Ghote tells Subbiah how Nicky D'Costa was murdered and proceeds to question her about her test results. Subbiah remarks that Abdul Khan was a patient at the teaching hospital recently. Ghote asks whether she anticipated her results before completing the actual experiment. She admits faking her results. Ghote now believes that Subbiah is the murderer. He accuses her and she reacts in amazement, saying that Chagoo was clearly strangled. Ghote realises that he only saw the body laying face down, and the inspector originally assigned to the case never forwarded the medical examiner's report. Ghote realises that Chagoo could not have been strangled by Subbiah or Phaterpaker because neither of them have the necessary strength. Dr Mahipal has a withered arm, eliminating him as a suspect. Returning to the police station, Ghote talks to the forensic expert who examined the stool from the institute reptile room. The expert admits he only compared the fingerprints on the stool to the three suspects Ghote named; Subbiah, Phaterpaker and Mahipal. Without Khan's file in front of him, he could not identify the fingerprints. Khan's file is retrieved and his fingerprints are a perfect match. Ghote realises he can arrest and charge Khan with murder and recalls, with satisfaction, the words used by Commissioner's at the start of the case: \\"Frankly, Inspector, it will take a better man than you to put paid to Abdul Khan\\". Characters in \\"Asking Questions\\" Inspector Ganesh Ghote: A hard working and honest police inspector in the Crime Branch of Bombay police. Abdul Khan: A criminal on Bombay police's most wanted list. Supplied cocaine smuggled from the United States of America and A.C.E. drug samples stolen from Mira Behn Institute to Bombay film stars. Known to have used airline stewardess Nicky D'Costa as a drugs mule and believed to have ordered her brutal murder when she became a police informant. Seen threatening and assaulting Chandra Chagoo at the start of the novel. Chandra Chagoo: Snake handler for the Mira Behn Institute. Early in the novel Chagoo is found dead; his body was locked in the reptile room from the outside, apparently with Chagoo's own key. For much of the novel Ghote believes Ghote died from the bite of a Russell's Viper, deliberately released from its cage and locked in with Chagoo. In fact Chagoo was strangled. Chagoo was in charge of looking after the lab animals at the institute, and in this capacity discovers that Professor Phaterpaker is removing animals that do not support the test results that he desires. At the start of the novel Chagoo is threatened and assaulted by Abdul Khan. Dr Gauri Subbiah: A female researcher at the Mira Behn institute. Brilliant but from a humble background and believed by Ghote to be extremely honest. Subbiah eventually admits, in some distress, that she allowed Phaterpaker to persuade her to falsify results in her last experiments in order to publish a scientific paper ahead of an American team researching in the same area. Dr Ram Mahipal: Teacher at the nearby medical school and teaching hospital. Mahipal has a withered arm. He was dedicated to his research but was forced to resign from the Mira Behn Institute under mysterious circumstances. He misrepresents himself as a member of the Dalit caste because he first attended university under a programme where university places are reserved for members of the lower classes. In fact he is a member of the Brahmin caste. His father works as a cook in at medical school where he works, which Ghote discovers. Professor Phaterpaker: Director of the Mira Behn Institute. Admits that as a young man he was persuaded to \\"anticipate\\" the results of a medical experiment in order to lay first claim to a research breakthrough. In the twenty years since then Phaterpaker has increasingly relied on falsifying his results, at the institute he does this by removing lab animals that do not support the experimental result he is trying to obtain. Chandra Chagoo learned this and was able to use it to negotiate a truce when Phaterpaker discovered Chagoo's theft of drugs from the Mira Behn Institute. Major themes The major theme of the novel is the nature, methods and consequences of enquiry, including police investigation and scientific method. Literary significance and criticism Amazon.com quotes two favourable reviews, one from Kirkus Reviews that describes the book as an \\"archly amusing fable\\" and the other from Joanne Wilkinson of Booklist magazine. Amazon.com also lists a customer review by \\"edwartel\\" [sic] that calls Asking Questions \\"a superior book\\". Crime Time Magazine reviewed the book, saying it was: \\"a fine addition to the cannon\\". Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science The novel takes place in Mumbai, India. The plot concerns an institute that researches medicines made from snake venom, a genuine area of scientific research, especially to produce antivenom. Inspector Ghote believes the murder victim died from the bite of a Russell's Viper. In fact the victim was killed by manual strangulation Awards and nominations Asking Questions was released in 1996, the year that H. R. F. Keating was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger for Outstanding Services to Crime Literature by the Crime Writers' Association of Great Britain. The British editions of the book often refer to the award on the front cover.

Biography =Early life= She was born in Warsaw as a daughter of a craftsman-carpenter. She studied in a public school but was expelled in 1905 after school strike. In 1914 her family relocated to Russia. Apolonia left alone on her own started to work as a teacher in kindergartens, libraries and amateur theatres in Warsaw and vicinities. She sent her first writing drafts to Gabriela Zapolska and gained her approval. During World War I she was active in the independence movement and was a member of Polish Military Organisation. Her first work was a short story Dwa fragmenty (Two Fragments), for which she was awarded by Echo Pragi magazine in 1915. =Literary progress= In 1920 she married Stanisław Gojawiczyński, and year later gave birth to daughter Wanda. Until 1926 lived in Bielsk Podlaski and worked in local administration. In 1931 Gojawiczyńska moved to Szarlej (currently neighbourhood of Piekary Śląskie). At that time Zofia Nałkowska read her short story Dzieciństwo (Childhood) and ensured her scholarship of National Culture Fund. In 1932 she published more works and began cooperation with Gazeta Polska. =During World War II= Gojawiczyńska spent World War II near Warsaw. In 1943 she was arrested and jailed in Pawiak prison in the section for women Serbia. She described her experience of that time in memories Krata. She was released from the prison as very ill, treated in the Saint Joseph Hospital. After the war she moved to Łódź. She died on 29 March 1963 and is buried at Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. =Summary= Pola Gojawiczyńska was one of the most popular women writers of the Polish literature of interwar period.

They occur naturally as part of a mixture of sesquiterpenes based upon the bisabolane scaffold. Sesquiterpenes of this family are known as insect juvenile hormone analogues (IJHA) because of their ability to mimic juvenile activity in order to stifle insect reproduction and growth. These compounds play important roles in conifers as the second line of defense against insect induced trauma and fungal pathogens. 600px History In 1965, Karel Sláma and Carroll Williams made a surprising discovery: paper towels made from the wood of the balsam fir (Abies balsamea, Fig. 1) released vapors that elicited a potent effect on hemipteran bugs of the Pyrrhocoridae family. They named this substance \\"the paper factor.\\" It was thought to contain a mixture of JH-mimicking sesquiterpenes, but it wasn't until 1966 that (+)-juvabione was first isolated as an active component from the balsam fir by Bowers. 150px Figure 1. Abies balsamea Induction of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in conifers Insect herbivores such as bark beetles and their symbiotic fungal pathogens, pose as one of the greatest threats to conifer survival. When they feed on conifers, the subsequent wounds trigger a signaling cascade that results in the production of terpene synthases of many types, all of which arise from the terpene synthase gene cluster known as Tpsd. Induced gene expression is tightly regulated and time-dependent. Immediately after insect attack, toxic monoterpenes are released. These provide a volatile solvent for the diterpene resins so that successive evaporation leaves a barrier that seals the wound site. The transcription of sesquiterpene synthases was shown to begin on the third day following insect attack. Sesquiterpenoid JHAs continue to be produced up to twelve days later to prevent further insect reproduction. The first sesquiterpene to be formed, (E)-α-bisabolene (formed by (E)-α-bisabolene synthase), can be further transformed into juvabione and todomatuic acid. Biosynthesis of (+)-juvabione and (+)-todomatuic acid Sesquiterpenes are a class of terpenoids based upon a 15-carbon unit scaffold synthesized from isoprene units via the mevalonate pathway (Fig. 2). In this pathway, two molecules of acetyl-CoA undergo a condensation reaction to give acetoacetyl-CoA. This product then condenses with third molecule of acetyl-CoA in a stereospecific fashion to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) which then is reduced to mevalonic acid (MVA). A series of ATP-dependent transformations lead to a key isoprene unit, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) which can be isomerized to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). DMAPP ionizes to its respective allylic cation that undergoes electrophilic addition to the double bond of IPP. Upon loss of a proton, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) is formed. GPP undergoes an elimination reaction to form its corresponding allylic cation. Electrophilic addition of another IPP unit to the GPP cation results in a tertiary carbocation intermediate that forms a fifteen-carbon farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) upon loss of a proton. 300px Figure 2. Generalized pathway for the synthesis of sesquiterpenes. Farnesyl diphosphate is the universal precursor to a wide variety of linear and cyclized sesquiterpenes. Of particular interest to juvabione biosynthesis (Scheme 1), dissociation of the terminal diphosphate from the FPP precursor generates the (E,E)-farnesyl allylic cation, leading to nerolidyl diphosphate (NPP). NPP is another precursor that can undergo different reaction types, but in this case, bisabolene synthase directs a single cyclization event by electrophilic attack of C-1 onto the double bond of C-6 to form a six-membered ring. Deprotonation of the resultant tertiary cation yields (E)-α-bisabolene. Currently, the mechanistic details describing the conversion of (E)-α-bisabolene to (+)-juvabione and (+)-todomatuic acid have not been fully described. 500px Scheme 1.

In some states (specifically Arizona, California, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, and Wisconsin), Silver Alerts also use variable-message signs on roadways to alert motorists to be on the lookout for missing seniors. In cases in which a missing person is believed to be missing on foot, Silver Alerts have used Reverse 911 or other emergency notification systems to notify nearby residents of the neighborhood surrounding the missing person's last known location. Silver alerts can also be used for children who are missing without being in danger or abducted. Supporters of Silver Alert point to the U.S.A's growing elderly population as a reason to support new programs to locate missing seniors. Approximately six in ten dementia victims will wander off at least once. If not found within 24 hours, up to half of wandering seniors with dementia suffer serious injury or death. Activation criteria Activation criteria for Silver Alerts vary from state to state. Some states limit Silver Alerts to persons over the age of 65 who have been medically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or a mental disability. Other states expand Silver Alert to include all children and adults with mental or developmental disabilities. In general, the decision to issue a Silver Alert is made by the law enforcement agency investigating the report of a missing person. Public information in a Silver Alert usually consists of the name and description of the missing person and a description of the missing person's vehicle and license plate number, e.g. David Smith GRN 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada FL LIC 989 ARN.  History  In December 2005, Oklahoma state Representative Fred Perry (R-Tulsa) announced his intention to introduce an \\"AMBER Alert for seniors\\", which he dubbed \\"Silver Alert.\\" In March 2006, the Oklahoma House of Representatives passed H.R. 1075, a resolution calling for a Silver Alert system to find missing seniors. In response to this non-binding resolution, the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety added Silver Alert notifications to the statewide alerts sent to law enforcement agencies and the media for rapid distribution. In April 2009, Governor Brad Henry signed legislation permanently establishing the Silver Alert program. In Georgia, public efforts to locate missing seniors increased following the April 2004 disappearance of Mattie Moore, a 68-year-old Atlanta resident with Alzheimer's disease. Eight months after Moore's disappearance, her body was found 500 yards (460 m) from her home. The City of Atlanta created \\"Mattie's Call\\" to coordinate and support Metro Atlanta law enforcement, emergency management and broadcasters to issue an urgent bulletin in missing persons cases involving persons with Alzheimer's disease, dementia and other mental disabilities. Legislation to create a statewide Mattie's Call program was enacted in April 2006. In Florida, Mary Zelter, an 86-year-old resident of Largo, drove away from her assisted-living facility on February 26, 2008, and never returned. Her body was found a week later away in the Intracoastal Waterway near a Clearwater boat ramp. Her submerged car was nearby. This tragedy prompted Pinellas County officials to create a Silver Alert pilot program that later grew into a statewide initiative. =National growth= Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia have Silver Alert or similar programs targeting missing seniors. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have missing persons recovery programs that are formally called \\"Silver Alert\\": * Alaska * Arizona * Arkansas * California * Connecticut * District of Columbia * Florida * Illinois * Indiana * Kansas * Louisiana * Maine * Maryland * Massachusetts * Mississippi * Nevada * New Jersey * New Mexico * North Carolina * North Dakota * Oklahoma * Oregon * Rhode Island * South Carolina * Tennessee * Texas * Washington * West Virginia * Wisconsin Additionally, nine states have programs to help locate missing seniors that are not officially called \\"Silver Alert\\" but contain criteria similar to existing Silver Alert programs: * Alabama Missing Senior Alert * Colorado, Missing Senior Citizen Alert * Georgia Mattie's Call * Kentucky Golden Alert * Michigan Mozelle Senior or Vulnerable Adult Medical Alert Act * New Hampshire Missing Senior Citizen Alert * New York Missing Vulnerable Adult Alert * Ohio Missing Adult Alert * Virginia Senior Alert Plus, nine states have missing-persons alert systems with broader criteria than conventional Silver Alert programs. These missing-person alerts apply to larger categories of endangered persons, or apply to all missing people, regardless of age or impairment: * Delaware, Gold Alert * Minnesota Brandon's Law * Missouri Endangered Person Advisory * Montana Missing and Endangered Persons Advisory * Nebraska Endangered Missing Advisory * Pennsylvania Missing and Endangered Person Advisory * South Dakota Endangered Persons Advisory * Utah Endangered Person Advisory * Wyoming Endangered Person Advisory =Federal legislation= In May 2008, Representative Lloyd Doggett introduced the National Silver Alert Act in the U.S. House of Representatives, a bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Silver Alert plans throughout the United States. Similar legislation was filed by Representatives Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) and Sue Myrick (R-NC). The three bills were combined into a single bill, H.R. 6064. The bill was passed by the House in September 2008 by a voice vote, but the 110th Congress adjourned before it could be considered in the U.S. Senate. The National Silver Alert Act was re-introduced in the 111th Congress as H.R. 632. It was passed by the House of Representatives on February 11, 2009, on a voice vote. Companion legislation (S.557) was introduced in the Senate by Senator Mel Martinez (R-FL) and Senator Herb Kohl (D-WI). S.1814, the National Silver Alert Act, is currently pending in the 113th Congress. It was reintroduced by Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) on December 12, 2013. The National Silver Alert Act has been endorsed by the Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA), Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Foundation of America, Elder Justice Coalition, National Silver Haired Congress, the National Association of Police Organizations and the National Sheriffs' Association. Criticism Critics of Silver Alert have raised concerns that the proliferation of color-coded alerts will reduce their importance, risking that alerts would be ignored as a \\"wolf cry\\". For example, Texas has created an Amber Alert, Silver Alert and Blue Alert (issued to locate an assailant in the event a law enforcement officer is killed or injured.) In New York, Governor George Pataki vetoed Silver Alert legislation in 2003, citing his concern that it would weaken the Amber Alert system and make the alerts too common. In the absence of state-level legislation, local Silver Alert programs have been enacted by New York City and five New York counties: Rockland, Suffolk, Nassau, Niagara and Erie. Some critics have raised concerns about the cost of implementing the Silver Alert program on a nationwide basis. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementation of the National Silver Alert Act would cost $59 million over a five-year period. During the House debate on the cost Representative Ted Poe (R-TX) noted that states with Silver Alerts have reported nominal costs associated with operating the system, since they are able to utilize existing Amber Alert infrastructure to issue Silver Alerts. Retrieval rate Because the implementation of Silver Alert systems vary from state to state, there are no national statistics for the retrieval rates resulting from Silver Alerts. However, among the states that publicly release statistics, retrieval rates indicate a higher level of success. For example, In North Carolina, 128 Silver Alerts were issued in 2008. Of these, 118 seniors were safely recovered. In Georgia, Mattie's Call garnered a safe return for 70 of the 71 calls issued between its inception in 2006 and January 2009. In Texas, the Silver Alert system was invoked 52 times in the first year following its inception in September 2007. Of these alerts, 48 of the missing seniors were located safely, and 13 of these recoveries were directly attributable to Silver Alert. In Florida, 136 Silver Alerts were issued in its first year (2008–2009), leading to 131 safe recoveries. 19 of these recoveries were directly attributable to Silver Alert. Over two years, 227 Silver Alerts have been issued in Florida – with 220 seniors located safely, and 36 of those recoveries attributed directly to the Silver Alert. Over three years, 377 Silver Alerts have been issued in Florida, with 367 seniors located safely, and 51 of those recoveries attributed directly to the Silver Alert. In Wisconsin, 18 Silver Alerts were issued in the first 5 months of the program, out of which 15 of missing seniors were found and safely returned home.

The poem describes Coleridge's sympathies for animals and the connection to nature he felt as part of his idea of Pantisocracy. It was later used by critics as a means to mock him. Background The poem \\"To a Young Jack Ass\\" or \\"To a Young Ass, Its Mother Being Tethered Near It\\" was composed during October 1794.Mays 2001 p. 146 It was inspired by a scene of a jack ass at Jesus Green. Soon after, the poem was published in the Morning Chronicle 9 December 1794 and marks the first time that Coleridge publicly talks about his idea of Pantisocracy.Holmes 1989 pp. 82–83 The poem was published in Coleridge's 1796 edition of poems and was revised for the 1797 edition. These later editions alter lines 27–36 to remove mention of Pantisocracy.Mays 2001 pp. 146–147 Poem The poem begins by addressing the oppressed foal:Sisman 2006 p. 91 The foal responds to the narrator, and the two form a bond:Taussig 2002 p. 126 The 1794 edition of the poem included a political meaning. Lines starting at 27 originally read: Themes The poem links the image of a jack ass, a low form of animal, with the narrator to reverse the natural order of the world. As part of Coleridge's political concept of Pantioscracy, man would connect to nature. In a letter to Francis Wrangham, dated 24 October 1794, Coleridge wrote:Holmes 1989 pp. 81–82 > If there be any whom I deem worthy of remembrance — I am their Brother. I > call even my Cat Sister in the Fraternity of universal Nature. Owls I > respect & Jack Asses I love: for Alderman & Hogs, Bishops & Royston Crows, I > have not particular partiality —; they are my Cousins however, at least by > Courtesy. But Kings, Wolves, Tygers, Generals, Ministers, & Hyaenas, I > renounce them all... May the Almighty Pantisocratizer of Souls > pantisocratize the Earth, and bless you and S. T. Coleridge.Holmes 1989 qtd. > p. 82 The poem was built off this playful idea and includes a mix of comedy along with a connection between the narrator and the jack ass that was part of \\"an oppressed Race\\". The response by the narrator is to feel compassion with an animal in distress, and he seeks to comfort the animal. In this view, Coleridge contradicts Godwin's and Mary Wollstonecraft's belief that you cannot befriend animals. Their argument is based on the idea that reason is needed to understand virtue, but Coleridge focuses on the emotional response that creates a bond between man and animal.Taussig 2002 pp. 125–126 The poem does rely on the ideas of Pantiosocracy, being connected to nature, and the idea of \\"One Life\\" that would appear in many of his later poems. However, the revised version removes the mention of Pantioscracy. The lines made light of Pantiosocracy, and some later critics, including William Empson, feel that Coleridge removed the lines because Coleridge was afraid of the public laughing at his ideas. However, Zachary Leader argues that \\"he wanted them laughed at. He just did not want them laughed at the wrong way.\\"Leader 1999 pp. 139–140 Sources This was a common image in the 18th-century, with many philosophers and writers, including Godwin, William Shield, and others, releasing their horses and mules to walk alongside them. A direct literary connection is to William Crowe's \\"To an Ass\\" (1793) and the poem incorporates a quote from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The idea of connecting with a lowly form of animal also appears in many literary works, including Robert Burns poems (example – \\"To a Mouse\\"), Southey's poems (example – \\"To a Spider\\"), the works of Laurence Sterne (both Tristram Shandy and A Sentimental Journey) and Cervantes's Don Quixote. Response Richard Holmes, Coleridge's 20th-century biographer, points out that, in Coleridge's 1796 collection, \\"The poem which had the most popular impact remained the controversial 'To a Young Jack Ass'.\\"Holmes 1989 p. 113 The poem inspired James Gillray to poke fun at Coleridge, William Godwin, and Robert Southey by depicting them with the ears of a jack ass in a caricature titled \\"New Morality\\" in the July 1798 Anti- Jacobin Magazine. Likewise, James and Horace Smith parodied the poem in a piece called \\"Play house Musings\\". Lord Byron would mention the Gillray image in his English Bards and Scotch Reviewers series later.Holmes 1989 p. 83 Of the criticism, Coleridge was not bothered by anything except Gillray's description under the illustration that contained a negative biographical description, claiming that Coleridge was a deist while at Cambridge and that he left England and his family to explore the world.Sisman 2006 p. 293 Notes References Holmes, Richard.

Beyond short-term relief associated with dry environment for those trying to excrete sputum, Norman Edelman of the American Lung Association suspects reported improvement in the health condition of patients might simply be due to the placebo effect. A recent review of the research supporting halotherapy determined that, out of 151 studies conducted on this topic, only 1 was a well-designed randomized control trial that met their inclusion criteria for a meta-analysis. Researchers found that the majority of the research on this topic has serious methodological flaws that should be considered. Without vigorous control trials, nothing intelligent can be said to promote the purported beneficial effects of halotherapy, despite claims made in the media to the contrary.  History  Many forms of halotherapy have been used for millennia. The earliest known mention of spa resorts date back to 12th Century Poland, in which people were urged to bathe in mineral waters. Modern history of halotherapy dates back to 1843, when a Polish physician named Feliks Boczkowski promoted the idea of salt treatment after noticing that workers at a salt mines, unlike other miners, did not have respiratory or lung problems.

History The population of Alona, and surrounding villages of the Pitsilia locale, like Platanistassa, have traditionally been Greek-speaking and Christian. Moslem Turks did not live in the area between 1572 and 1964, although many Turks vacationed there. There have been periods of Catholic and Venetian domination, however, with the Church of Cyprus being dissolved.  Nature and village beauty  The village lies in a unique green valley of hazels. The Alona smothered in green crammed into gardens with all kinds of fruit trees and large areas of nut trees, is one of the most beautiful villages of our country. For seven months of the year find fragrant fruit of all words starting with cherries May until the late grapes of November. All seasons are very pronounced in the village. In winter there is white fur snow, spring is fragrant due to the flowering of almond and fruit trees, summer is green and fresh, and autumn boasts the gold of yellowed leaves. The central streets are paved, covered over in large part by thick vines, appearing less a mountainous Mediterranean village and more a road through a rainforest.

There are the remains of the works of a folk craftsman who left a permanent mark in the village.  Churches  The village church surrounded by cherry trees and other trees was built in 1835 on the ruins of the previous that once upon delivery monastery and was destroyed by fire. Among the icons there is also St George patron of the village, work of the famous painter Kornaros of Crete. Old is the miraculous icon of the Virgin Galaktotrofousa whose fame is known not only in the region but in the whole of Cyprus and until a few years ago took refuge in the grace of women from all over the island, to have milk to suck their children. In 1998 and within the exhibition of Treasures of the Church of St. George Alon became revelation of images and below the silver investment has discovered rare picture of St. George, only known work of Simeon Protoiereos (1641) and the icon Chrysogalousas (1648). The ancient church of Panagia Kardakiotissas restored after the fire that devastated in 1987 and returned to its original form before the renovations of the 1960s. The chapel is preserved only the ancient image of Christ after the miraculous image of the Virgin was burned. A few years ago the love of local people rebuilt the chapel of St. Nicholas Symfylou near the Forest Virgin Station and 3 km. From the village of Kato Moni. The chapel was built on the ruins of the old church of St. Nicholas and was inaugurated in 2008. Culture Alona annually hosts a festival to mark the feast day of the Dormition of the Mother of God, on the 15th of August. This event involves traditional Cypriot music and food. There are two very old churches, the main one being St George, which houses an exceptional ikon of the saint. The village has a library, and a co-operative.

Modern use of this therapy started in Germany by Karl Hermann Spannagel. Research is ongoing what health conditions can be treated with this technique. A 2001 Cochrane summary concluded that as no trials had been done, there is no evidence to determine whether breathing air inside a cave is useful in treating asthma. Speleotherapy in Bad Soden- Salmünster, Germany.  History  In a classic form, speleotherapy was the use of underground mineral and hot springs – underground balneo and hydrotherapy. The ancient Greeks practiced salt-based remedies. Hippocrates (460 BC) had documented salt based therapies including inhalation of steam from salt water. According to Hippocrates procedure was providing relief of respiratory symptoms.History of Salt Therapy Illawarra Salt Therapy There are claims of improvements in the breathing of miners in Roman times and medieval times. Speleotherapy hospitals existed in Italy in the 19th century. In the middle of the 19th century, an attempt has been made to use the air of caves for diseases treatment. The clinic, founded in Mammoth Cave (Kentucky, USA), was intended for tuberculosis patients. A few months after the death of one of the patients, the hospital was closed. The history of modern speleotherapy dates back to the 1950s. At this time, speleotherapeutic hospitals arise in several countries of Eastern and Central Europe. Unitil recently speleotherapy was not practiced in the US and Great Britain. The emergence of speleotherapy as a therapeutic method in Encyclopedia of Caves and Karst Science is associated with the episode World War II. Residents of Ennepetal (Germany) used the nearby Klüterköhle cave as a bomb shelter. Dr. Karl Hermann Spannagel drew attention to the improvement of well-being of asthmatics who were in the cave. After the war, he began research into the therapeutic effect of caves in treating bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, and whooping cough a. The research results were published in 1949. After this, speleotherapeutic facilities under the natural conditions of karst caves arise in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The success of the method led to the birth of the international speleotherapeutic society. In 1969, the Speleotherapy Commission was founded at International Union of Speleologists. In 1968, in Solotvyn (now in Ukraine), the first speleotherapy clinic was opened on the territory of the USSR, and the next year its territory was expanded for the first time in the world after the construction of additional development on a special project. In 1977, in the Perm Region, the world's first speleotherapy clinic was opened in a potash mine. In 1982, another important step was taken in speleotherapy in the USSR: the first climate chamber was patented, equipped with a salt filter-saturator and recreating the conditions of salt mines on the earth's surface.

No one was injured.Synagogue shooting spurs calls for tighter security, Aftenposten English edition The four allegedly were the then 29-year-old criminal-turned-Islamist Arfan Bhatti of Pakistani origin, a 28-year-old Norwegian-Pakistani, a 28-year-old Norwegian of foreign origin, and a 26-year- old Norwegian. Bhatti was acquitted for terror charges, but still convicted for co-conspiracy to the shooting (along with several other unrelated charges) which was instead judged as \\"coarse vandalism\\". The three other men were acquitted of all charges. =Interfaith peace ring= On 21 February 2015, around 1,000 people formed a human \\"ring of peace\\" outside the synagogue on Shabbat, to show that they deplore antisemitic violence. The event, which was initiated by a group of young Norwegian Muslims, occurred shortly after a string of terrorist attacks across Europe, including in the Île-de-France attacks in Paris and the Copenhagen shootings. According to organizer Hajrah Arshad, the intent of the ring was to show \\"that Islam is about love and unity.\\" Zeeshan Abdullah, a co-organizer, stated that \\"We want to demonstrate that Jews and Muslims do not hate each other...We do not want individuals to define what Islam is for the rest of us...There are many more peace-mongers than warmongers.\\" The crowd of Muslims, Jews, and others held hands in unity as Norway's Chief Rabbi Michael Melchior sang \\"Eliyahu Hanavi\\", the traditional song after Havdalah. The demonstration received international media attention.21 Feb 2015, VG, Norske muslimers fredsring får bred internasjonal omtale Some media reports stated that possibly only a minority of those present were Muslims. Ervin Kohn, the president of the Norwegian Jewish community, told enquiring reporters that the exact number of Muslims among those present at the demonstration was impossible to quantify.

Graham (born June 29, 1933, in Hymera, Indiana) is a noted American historian of science, particularly science in Russia. He has taught and published at Indiana University, Columbia University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard University, where he is currently a research associate. He was a participant in one of the first academic exchange programs between the United States and the Soviet Union, studying at Moscow University in 1960-61. He wrote a popular book on Native American history (A Face in the Rock) and a memoir (Moscow Stories) which describes his youth in the United States and his adventures in Russia. He has also been a strong supporter of human rights and scholarship. He was a member of the board of trustees of the Soros Foundation. For many years he has been a member of the Governing Council of the Program on Basic Research and Higher Education, which supports the combining of research and teaching in Russian universities and is financially supported by the MacArthur Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation, the Russian Ministry of Science and Education, and local groups in Russia. He is a member of the advisory council of the U.S. Civilian Research & Development Foundation, which supports international scientific collaboration. For many years he was a member of the board of trustees of the European University at St. Petersburg and still serves on the board of a body raising money for that university. He donated several thousand books from his library to the European University which has established a special collection in his name. In much of his work in the history of science, Graham has demonstrated the influence of social context on science, even its theoretical structure. For example, in his Science and Philosophy in the Soviet Union (which was a finalist for a National Book Award) he delineated the influence of Marxism on science in Russia — in some cases, such as the Lysenko Affair, deleterious, but, in other cases, particularly in physics, psychology, and origin of life studies, positive. In addition to writing on the history of scientific theories, Graham has written much on the organization of science in Russia and the Soviet Union, including a book on the early history of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (The Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Communist Party) and a more recent one on the situation of science in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union (Science in the New Russia; co-written with Irina Dezhina). Education, awards and personal life Graham earned his B.A. in chemical engineering at Purdue University and his M.A. and doctorate degree in history at Columbia University.Science historian Loren Graham profile, wupa.wustl.edu; accessed May 24, 2017. In 1996 he received the George Sarton Medal of the History of Science Society and in 2000 he received the Follo Award of the Michigan Historical Society for his contributions to Michigan history. Graham is a member of a number of honorary societies, both American and foreign, including the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Russian Academy of Natural Science. His books have been published in English, Italian, German, Russian, Spanish, French, Japanese, Greek, Persian, Korean and Chinese.

According to a 2005 survey that studied trends in annual reporting, the average number of pages in an annual report was 65, and the number of copies produced averaged between less than 5,000 to more than 50,000. Green annual reports are frequently printed using eco- friendly soy inks. As opposed to traditional petroleum-based ink, soy inks are more environmentally friendly, are available in brighter colors, and makes it easier to recycle paper. Petroleum-based inks contain 30-35% Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), while soybean oil-based inks typically range from only 0-5% VOCs. New processes also had to be developed to make the de-inking and recycling of paper easier, and soy-based inks perform better in conjunction with modern de-inking procedures. Green annual reports are also frequently printed on FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) Certified Printers. The FSC is an independent, non-governmental, not for profit organization established to promote the responsible management of the world’s forests.

He is currently serving as the Chairman of the Guangdong People's Political Consultative Conference, a mostly ceremonial political advisory body. Wang spent much of his career in his native Jiangsu province. He has an academic background in the field of agriculture. He served successively as the party chief of the cities of Wuxi and Suzhou in Jiangsu, before being transferred in 2010 to serve as acting mayor, then Party Secretary of Shenzhen, a position he served in until 2015. Wang was an alternate member of the 17th and 18th Central Committees of the Communist Party. Career =Early life and academic career= Born in 1958 in Binhai County, in northern Jiangsu province, Wang worked in a rural commune in the latter years of the Cultural Revolution. He joined the Communist Party in 1976, the year Mao died. He became part of the first batch of students to return to school after China's higher education system was dismantled as part of the Cultural Revolution. Wang spent much of his earlier career in academia. He enrolled in Nanjing Agricultural College and earned a degree in agriculture and economic management in 1982. He continued his studies for the next six years, earning a master's, then a doctorate in his field. By 1989, he became a lecturer at the university, and then an associate dean in the economics and trade school. He then became assistant to the school's president. In 1991 he earned the opportunity to study abroad at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. In 1992 he returned to China and served as the chief administrator for the university's president, before becoming Vice President of the University. =Jiangsu= Wang entered the Jiangsu provincial government in the late 1990s. At the turn of the century, Wang received a series of quick promotions to progressively senior positions. After serving a two-year tenure in the Agricultural Science Institute of Jiangsu, Wang went on to become deputy director of the provincial department of agriculture. In 2000, ostensibly due to his academic background, he was transferred to head the provincial department of education. In 2001, he was again transferred, this time to take on the post of acting Mayor of Wuxi; he was formally elected mayor in 2002. In 2003, he was again promoted to become the city's Communist Party Secretary, which was, in reality, the city's top political office. By 2004, only four years since serving as deputy director of the department of agriculture, he earned a seat on the provincial Party Standing Committee, the province's top decision making body, joining the inner circle of the Jiangsu political elite and becoming one of the province's top-ranked politicians. =Guangdong= In June 2009, Wang left his native Jiangsu province to take on the office of the acting Mayor of Shenzhen, a metropolis next to Hong Kong and known to be China's most successful Special Economic Zone. Wang replaced Xu Zongheng, who was dismissed for corruption.Wang as new Shenzhen mayorXinhua China News Digest at 11:00 GMT, June 12 He was quickly promoted to party chief the next year, and also earned a spot on the Guangdong provincial Party Standing Committee, serving under party chief Wang Yang. Shenzhen's political landscape experienced rapid changes as a result of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, culminating in the abrupt dismissal of Jiang Zunyu, the city's former Political and Legal Affairs Commission Secretary. In late 2014, rumours that Wang was \\"in trouble\\" circulated widely, largely due to speculation that the Guangdong political scene was due for a 'reshuffle' following the abrupt dismissal of Wan Qingliang, a once-popular Cantonese politician who was serving as party chief of the provincial capital Guangzhou. Various media outlets speculated that Wang would be transferred out of his job in Shenzhen for a lower-profile position in the Ministry of Education or in Anhui province, or be given a ceremonial role so he could keep his rank and benefits but be removed from a position of actual political power. In February 2015, Wang was elected the Chairman of the Guangdong provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a largely ceremonial legislative consultation body. He replaced Zhu Mingguo, a former top provincial official who, like Wang's Shenzhen mayoral predecessor Xu Zongheng, had also been dismissed for corruption. Even though this was technically a promotion as it made Wang an official with full provincial- ministerial rank, many observers characterized the move as having transferred Wang away from the political centre stage. Leading positions in the CPPCC in Chinese provinces are largely seen as so-called \\"political retirement home\\", bestowed to officials of advanced age as an honour for their service in government but considered to be largely a position without actual political power. At the same time, Wang became dogged by corruption rumours as the media speculated that Wang was actually being 'deposed' as part of a wider anti- corruption campaign targeting associates of ex-President Jiang Zemin. When Wang formally stepped down as Shenzhen party chief at a meeting of the municipal leadership on March 28, news footage showed tears in Wang's eyes as well as awkwardness and pessimism about Wang's expression. He was replaced by Ma Xingrui. Family According to numerous Chinese-language media outlets, Wang is the nephew of Wang Yeping, wife of former President and General Secretary Jiang Zemin, although some political insiders from Shenzhen have dismissed this as a baseless rumour. Nevertheless, he was widely considered to be a protege of Jiang, who is also from Jiangsu province.

It was in this discipline that the first world record in freediving was registered, when the Greek sponge fisherman Stathis Chantzis dived to a depth of 83 m (272 ft). It consists of a variable ballast dive using a skandalopetra tied to a rope. A companion on a boat recovers the diver by pulling the rope up after the descent, and keeps a watch on the diver from the surface.  Origins  A skandalopetra dive known to contemporary divers is that of Stathis Chantzis, a Greek sponge fisherman who, on 14 July 1913, in the Karpathos port recovered the lost anchor of the Regina Margherita, a ship of the Italian Navy, at the depth of 83 m. That feat is considered the first depth record in apnea diving. The skandalopetra (or simply petra, \\"stone\\") is a stone, usually of marble or granite, weighing between 8 and 14 kg, with rounded corners and hydrodynamic shape. It was the only tool used by divers, since the time of Alexander the Great. The fishermen, naked, were secured to the stone with a thin cord. The skandalopetra itself was secured to the boat with the same rope. This link allowed fishermen to dive safely for centuries.  Competitive  In recent times skandalopetra diving has become a discipline of competitive apnea. It is a team sport - the only true team event in freediving. Teams are formed by two athletes: one is the diver (Voutichtis) and the other is the rope tender (Kolaouzeris). In modern skandalopetra competition, divers are allowed the use of a noseclip, but other equipment such as a wetsuit, mask or fins is not allowed. In this discipline there is no waste of energy and activity is comparable to the descent in variable weight apnea diving. The athlete prepares for the dive while on the boat, holding the stone, then dives, remaining motionless and as vertical as possible. After reaching the maximum depth of the dive, the diver moves his feet onto the petra and is pulled to the surface by his companion. It is essential that the diver and assistant are co-ordinated, the latter should at all times know the depth of the diver, feel when they slow down to equalize, leaving the stone when it arrives at the bottom and finally when it is the right time to pull the diver back up. During the descent the diver can handle the stone in different ways, serving as a drag brake, to steer, and as ballast. AIDA's No Limits discipline is in a sense a contemporary version of skandalopetra diving; instead of a rock the diver uses a weighted sled running down a shotline, and the line attendant is replaced by inflated lifting bags.

Further info: Little Red Pentecostal , Peter J. Leithart, July 9, 2007. and later European literary fairy tale about an anthropomorphic cat who uses trickery and deceit to gain power, wealth, and the hand of a princess in marriage for his penniless and low-born master. The oldest telling is by Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola, who included it in his The Facetious Nights of Straparola (c. 1550–1553) in XIV–XV. Another version was published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile with the title Cagliuso, and a tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by Charles Perrault (1628–1703), a retired civil servant and member of the Académie française. There is a version written by Girolamo Morlini, from whom Straparola used various tales in The Facetious Nights of Straparola. The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called Histoires ou contes du temps passé. The book was an instant success and remains popular. Perrault's Histoires has had considerable impact on world culture. The original Italian title of the first edition was Costantino Fortunato, but was later known as Il gatto con gli stivali (lit. The cat with the boots); the French title was \\"Histoires ou contes du temps passé, avec des moralités\\" with the subtitle \\"Les Contes de ma mère l'Oye\\" (\\"Stories or Fairy Tales from Past Times with Morals\\", subtitled \\"Mother Goose Tales\\"). The frontispiece to the earliest English editions depicts an old woman telling tales to a group of children beneath a placard inscribed \\"MOTHER GOOSE'S TALES\\" and is credited with launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. \\"Puss in Boots\\" has provided inspiration for composers, choreographers, and other artists over the centuries. The cat appears in the third act pas de caractère of Tchaikovsky's ballet The Sleeping Beauty, appears in the sequels and self-titled spin-off to the animated film Shrek and is signified in the logo of Japanese anime studio Toei Animation. Puss in Boots is also a popular pantomime in the UK. Plot The tale opens with the third and youngest son of a miller receiving his inheritance—a cat. At first, the youngest son laments, as the eldest brother gains the mill, and the middle brother gets the mules. The feline is no ordinary cat, however, but one who requests and receives a pair of boots. Determined to make his master's fortune, the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master, the fictional Marquis of Carabas. The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months, for which he is rewarded. Puss meets the ogre in a nineteenth-century illustration by Gustave Doré One day, the king decides to take a drive with his daughter. The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their carriage passes. The cat disposes of his master's clothing beneath a rock. As the royal coach nears, the cat begins calling for help in great distress. When the king stops to investigate, the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing. The king has the young man brought from the river, dressed in a splendid suit of clothes, and seated in the coach with his daughter, who falls in love with him at once. The cat hurries ahead of the coach, ordering the country folk along the road to tell the king that the land belongs to the \\"Marquis of Carabas\\", saying that if they do not he will cut them into mincemeat. The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an ogre who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures. The ogre displays his ability by changing into a lion, frightening the cat, who then tricks the ogre into changing into a mouse. The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it. The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre, and, impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate, gives the lad the princess in marriage. Thereafter, the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement. The tale is followed immediately by two morals: \\"one stresses the importance of possessing industrie and savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess.\\" The Italian translation by Carlo Collodi notes that the tale gives useful advice if you happen to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas. This is the theme in France, but other versions of this theme exist in Asia, Africa, and South America. Background Handwritten and illustrated manuscript of Perrault's \\"Le Maître Chat\\" dated 1695 Perrault's \\"The Master Cat, or Puss in Boots\\" is the most renowned tale in all of Western folklore of the animal as helper. However, the trickster cat was not Perrault's invention. Centuries before the publication of Perrault's tale, Somadeva, a Kashmir Brahmin, assembled a vast collection of Indian folk tales called Kathā Sarit Sāgara (lit. \\"The ocean of the streams of stories\\") that featured stock fairy tale characters and trappings such as invincible swords, vessels that replenish their contents, and helpful animals. In the Panchatantra (lit. \\"Five Principles\\"), a collection of Hindu tales from the 2nd century BC., a tale follows a cat who fares much less well than Perrault's Puss as he attempts to make his fortune in a king's palace. In 1553, \\"Costantino Fortunato\\", a tale similar to \\"Le Maître Chat\\", was published in Venice in Giovanni Francesco Straparola's Le Piacevoli Notti (lit. The Facetious Nights), the first European storybook to include fairy tales. In Straparola's tale however, the poor young man is the son of a Bohemian woman, the cat is a fairy in disguise, the princess is named Elisetta, and the castle belongs not to an ogre but to a lord who conveniently perishes in an accident. The poor young man eventually becomes King of Bohemia. An edition of Straparola was published in France in 1560. The abundance of oral versions after Straparola's tale may indicate an oral source to the tale; it also is possible Straparola invented the story. In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was published in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved in a manner similar to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats. It is likely that Perrault was aware of the Straparola tale, since 'Facetious Nights' was translated into French in the sixteenth century and subsequently passed into the oral tradition. Publication Giovanni Francesco Straparola is known as the writer of the oldest version of the tale. He probably invented the original story. Detail of a portrait of Charles Perrault by Philippe Lallemand The oldest record of written history was published in Venice by the Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola in his The Facetious Nights of Straparola (c. 1550–53) in XIV-XV. His original title was Costantino Fortunato (lit. Lucky Costantino). Le Maître Chat, ou le Chat Botté was later published by Barbin in Paris in January 1697 in a collection of tales called Histoires ou contes du temps passé. The collection included \\"La Belle au bois dormant\\" (\\"The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood\\"), \\"Le petit chaperon rouge\\" (\\"Little Red Riding Hood\\"), \\"La Barbe bleue\\" (\\"Blue Beard\\"), \\"Les Fées\\" (\\"The Enchanted Ones\\", or \\"Diamonds and Toads\\"), \\"Cendrillon, ou la petite pantoufle de verre\\" (\\"Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper\\"), \\"Riquet à la Houppe\\" (\\"Riquet with the Tuft\\"), and \\"Le Petit Poucet\\" (\\"Hop o' My Thumb\\"). The book displayed a frontispiece depicting an old woman telling tales to a group of three children beneath a placard inscribed \\"CONTES DE MA MERE L'OYE\\" (Tales of Mother Goose). The book was an instant success. Le Maître Chat first was translated into English as \\"The Master Cat, or Puss in Boots\\" by Robert Samber in 1729 and published in London for J. Pote and R. Montagu with its original companion tales in Histories, or Tales of Past Times, By M. Perrault.The distinction of being the first to translate the tales into English was long questioned. An edition styled Histories or Tales of Past Times, told by Mother Goose, with Morals. Written in French by M. Perrault, and Englished by G.M. Gent bore the publication date of 1719, thus casting doubt upon Samber being the first translator. In 1951, however, the date was proven to be a misprint for 1799 and Samber's distinction as the first translator was assured. The book was advertised in June 1729 as being \\"very entertaining and instructive for children\\". A frontispiece similar to that of the first French edition appeared in the English edition launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. Samber's translation has been described as \\"faithful and straightforward, conveying attractively the concision, liveliness and gently ironic tone of Perrault's prose, which itself emulated the direct approach of oral narrative in its elegant simplicity.\\" Since that publication, the tale has been translated into various languages and published around the world. Question of authorship Perrault's son Pierre Darmancour was assumed to have been responsible for the authorship of Histoires with the evidence cited being the book's dedication to Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, the youngest niece of Louis XIV, which was signed \\"P. Darmancour\\". Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to have been interested in contes de veille or contes de ma mère l'oye, and in 1693 published a versification of \\"Les Souhaits Ridicules\\" and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called \\"Peau d'Ane\\". Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat Botté) existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication. Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen years old at the time the manuscript was prepared and, as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note, quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales. Darmancour, who became a soldier, showed no literary inclinations, and, when he died in 1700, his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales. However, when Perrault senior died in 1703, the newspaper alluded to his being responsible for \\"La Belle au bois dormant\\", which the paper had published in 1696. Analysis In folkloristics, Puss in Boots is classified as Aarne-Thompson-Uther ATU 545B, \\"Puss in Boots\\", a subtype of ATU 545, \\"The Cat as Helper\\".Thompson, Stith. The Folktale. University of California Press. 1977. pp. 58-59. Folklorists Joseph Jacobs and Stith Thompson point that the Perrault's tale is the possible source of the Cat Helper story in later European folkloric traditions.Thompson, Stith. The Folktale. University of California Press. 1977. p. 58. Jacobs, Joseph. European Folk and Fairy Tales. New York, London: G. P. Putnam's sons. 1916. pp. 239-240.

Ludwig Tieck published a dramatic satire based on the tale, called Der gestiefelte Kater, and, in 1812, the Brothers Grimm inserted a version of the tale into their Kinder- und Hausmärchen. In ballet, Puss appears in the third act of Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty in a pas de caractère with The White Cat. In film and television, Walt Disney produced an animated black and white silent short based on the tale in 1922. It was also adapted into a manga by the famous Japanese writer and director Hayao Miyazaki, followed by an anime feature film, distributed by Toei in 1969. The title character, Pero, named after Perrault, has since then become the mascot of Toei Animation, with his face appearing in the studio's logo. In the mid-1980s, Puss in Boots was televised as an episode of Faerie Tale Theatre with Ben Vereen and Gregory Hines in the cast. Another version from the Cannon Movie Tales series features Christopher Walken as Puss, who in this adaptation is a cat who turns into a human when wearing the boots. The TV show Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child features the story in a Hawaiian setting. The episode stars the voices of David Hyde Pierce as Puss in Boots, Dean Cain as Kuhio, Pat Morita as King Makahata, and Ming-Na Wen as Lani. In addition, the shapeshifting ogre is replaced with a shapeshifting giant (voiced by Keone Young). Another adaptation of the character with little relation to the story was in the Pokémon anime episode \\"Like a Meowth to a Flame,\\" where a Meowth owned by the character Tyson wore boots, a hat, and a neckerchief. Puss in Boots as he appears in the 2004 film Shrek 2 DreamWorks Animation released the animated feature Puss in Boots, with Antonio Banderas reprising his voice-over role of Puss in Boots from the Shrek films, on November 4, 2011. This new film's story bears no similarities to the book. The character later appeared in The Adventures of Puss in Boots voiced by Eric Bauza. Commentaries Jacques Barchilon and Henry Pettit note in their introduction to The Authentic Mother Goose: Fairy Tales and Nursery Rhymes that the main motif of \\"Puss in Boots\\" is the animal as helper and that the tale \\"carries atavistic memories of the familiar totem animal as the father protector of the tribe found everywhere by missionaries and anthropologists.\\" They also note that the title is original with Perrault as are the boots; no tale prior to Perrault's features a cat wearing boots. Woodcut frontispiece copied from the 1697 Paris edition of Perrault's tales and published in the English-speaking world. Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie observe that \\"the tale is unusual in that the hero little deserves his good fortune, that is if his poverty, his being a third child, and his unquestioning acceptance of the cat's sinful instructions, are not nowadays looked upon as virtues.\\" The cat should be acclaimed the prince of 'con' artists, they declare, as few swindlers have been so successful before or since. The success of Histoires is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons. While the literary skill employed in the telling of the tales has been recognized universally, it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author heard them told. The evidence for that assessment lies first in the simplicity of the tales, then in the use of words that were, in Perrault's era, considered populaire and du bas peuple, and finally, in the appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to the plot, do not illuminate the narrative, and thus, are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art. One such vestigial passage is Puss's boots; his insistence upon the footwear is explained nowhere in the tale, it is not developed, nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside. According to the Opies, Perrault's great achievement was accepting fairy tales at \\"their own level.\\" He recounted them with neither impatience nor mockery, and without feeling that they needed any aggrandisement such as a frame story—although he must have felt it useful to end with a rhyming moralité. Perrault would be revered today as the father of folklore if he had taken the time to record where he obtained his tales, when, and under what circumstances. Bruno Bettelheim remarks that \\"the more simple and straightforward a good character in a fairy tale, the easier it is for a child to identify with it and to reject the bad other.\\" The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal to him. If the character is a very good person, then the child is likely to want to be good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as \\"Puss in Boots\\" build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life. Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in \\"Puss in Boots\\") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment. An early nineteenth- century engraving of Perrault surrounded by vignettes from Histoires ou contes du temps passé In Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion Jack Zipes notes that Perrault \\"sought to portray ideal types to reinforce the standards of the civilizing process set by upper-class French society\\". A composite portrait of Perrault's heroines, for example, reveals the author's idealized female of upper-class society is graceful, beautiful, polite, industrious, well groomed, reserved, patient, and even somewhat stupid because for Perrault, intelligence in womankind would be threatening. Therefore, Perrault's composite heroine passively waits for \\"the right man\\" to come along, recognize her virtues, and make her his wife. He acts, she waits. If his seventeenth century heroines demonstrate any characteristics, it is submissiveness. A composite of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates the opposite of his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility to work their way up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century. According to fairy and folk tale researcher and commentator Jack Zipes, Puss is \\"the epitome of the educated bougeois secretary who serves his master with complete devotion and diligence.\\" The cat has enough wit and manners to impress the king, the intelligence to defeat the ogre, and the skill to arrange a royal marriage for his low-born master. Puss's career is capped by his elevation to grand seigneur and the tale is followed by a double moral: \\"one stresses the importance of possessing industrie et savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess.\\" The renowned illustrator of Dickens' novels and stories, George Cruikshank, was shocked that parents would allow their children to read \\"Puss in Boots\\" and declared: \\"As it stood the tale was a succession of successful falsehoods—a clever lesson in lying!—a system of imposture rewarded with the greatest worldly advantages.\\" Another critic, Maria Tatar, notes that there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a \\"linguistic virtuoso\\", a creature who has mastered the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth. \\"Puss in Boots\\" has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, \\"it has something to do with inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters.\\" Briggs does assert that cats were a form of fairy in their own right having something akin to a fairy court and their own set of magical powers. Still, it is rare in Europe's fairy tales for a cat to be so closely involved with human affairs. According to Jacob Grimm, Puss shares many of the features that a household fairy or deity would have including a desire for boots which could represent seven-league boots. This may mean that the story of \\"Puss and Boots\\" originally represented the tale of a family deity aiding an impoverished family member.Nukiuk H. 2011 Grimm's Fairies: Discover the Fairies of Europe's Fairy Tales, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform Stefan Zweig, in his 1939 novel, Ungeduld des Herzens, references Puss in Boots' procession through a rich and varied countryside with his master and drives home his metaphor with a mention of Seven League Boots.

Story At the beginning of the film different relatives of the twelve-year-old Jennifer \\"Jenny\\" McKenzie - the main protagonist and narrator - are being introduced. * Judge McKenzie, father of Jenny is killed by a gunshot after just having been appointed to the US Supreme Court. Jenny explains that he was killed when she was still very young. * Jenny's mother who is said to never have any time for her. * Jenny's grandmother, Rose McKenzie, a stage actress and too busy to spend her time with the family. * George, Jenny's puppy, friend and confidant. Jenny proceeds to introduce her current situation, being left alone by her stepmother in a penthouse apartment in Rome with plenty of cash and unlimited credit cards. Given that setup she proclaims: \\"Now I know what I want - to improve my education, serve justice, reinstate truth, basically what my father would have wanted me to do.\\" According to Jenny, her puppy has grown up and taken the form of her imaginary friend George - a large, mysterious person with a white wolf mask and a black cloak who never says a word. Jenny and George roam the streets of Rome at night, killing and mutilating thieves, liars, cheaters and any other kind of morally bankrupt people who cross their paths. The introductory victim, a thief, is seen stealing a handbag and running off. He is eventually run over by a van driver who was briefly seen tap-dancing in the same scene. As the story progresses her grandmother visits her in order to take her back to New York which interferes with Jenny's plans to bring justice to Rome. After her grandmother ran off to a café instead of visiting all the places Jenny told her to, a short scene shows a \\"blind\\" beggar stealing the key ring her grandmother left behind by accident. Now it is time for her grandmother to pay the price for having left her granddaughter all on her own. Jenny poisons the grandmother with her own medication in the tea and uses suggestion to \\"correct\\" her undesirable behavior. After she fails in doing so, it is time to take more drastic measures and prevent her grandmother from taking her back to New York. In one scene Jenny - an anatomy book with illustrations in her hand - tells George how to immobilize her grandmother who had been sedated beforehand. In order to avoid being detected, Jenny exploits the peanut allergy of her grandmother to shut her up by making it nearly impossible to breathe for the old lady. Once immobilized the old lady is being untied from the bed. At 10:00 am every morning Tom, Jenny's tutor, arrives to teach her. It is revealed that Jenny fell in love with him and one morning when he explains to her that he was at the opera the night before and had to go alone after breaking up with his girlfriend, she proclaims that he could have asked her to come along. The statement that he broke up recently gives her hope again to conquer his heart. Jenny successfully manages to avoid any attempts from her grandmother to talk to Tom and vice versa, both before and after the grandmother has been immobilized. Although the story includes more killings, they are of little relevance to the core story of Jenny, George, Tom and Rose. One night as Jenny, wearing make-up, approaches the café where she intends to meet up with Tom, she sees Tom embracing and kissing his girlfriend. Tom senses her presence and tries to stop her and explain the situation, but Jenny runs away. While Jenny was away, her grandmother succeeds throwing a book by Immanuel Kant out of the windows containing a message asking for help and explaining her situation. As Jenny arrives back home with her eyeliner all dissolved from crying, the \\"blind\\" beggar from café scene sits at the kitchen table, obviously having finished a meal, and she shouts at him claiming she would call the police. He calms her down by explaining it would not be a good idea to do so, given her grandmother was in such a bad shape and had asked for help, handing her the book with the message. At this point it also turns out that the beggar is only blind on one eye and wants money in exchange for his silence. When Jenny offers \\"two hundred\\", he says that \\"fifteen\\" would do and she presents him with a twenty Euro note. He takes the money and continues to explain that he meant \\"fifteen thousand dollars\\". After Jenny actually presents him the cash he proclaims that this will suffice for that day and he would be back for another twenty thousand the next day. In the next scene Jenny shouts at her grandmother for trying to get help and is interrupted by a phone call. Taking the call on one phone, Tom explains that he was trying to reach her for the last hour and the grandmother is seen trying to reach another phone in the room that had been her prison. Jenny feels cheated and accuses Tom of being a liar and telling him he would have to pay for that. When Tom asks to talk to her grandmother she dismisses the request claiming she would not be able to get on the phone, which is when the grandmother eventually reaches and picks up the phone and calls for help. Jenny hangs up and after shouting another time at her grandmother proceeds to deal with the beggar. While Jenny and George are off to kill the beggar, Tom is seen eventually breaking into the penthouse after the doorbell shows no effect. He finds the grandmother and it is at this point that it turns out George is really only an imaginary friend only seen by Jenny and it was the girl herself who killed and mutilated all the victims. Tom calls the ambulance and proceeds searching the apartment after he hears a baseball bat falling on the floor. He eventually finds a number of drawings with wolves and a freezer with the labeled remainders of the past mutilated victims. As he rushes out of Jenny's room in panic, Jenny attacks him with the baseball bat until he is unconscious. Shortly after the doorbell rings as the ambulance has arrived. Jenny proceeds to knock out Tom for good - not killing him, though - and then opens the door, presenting Tom as the reason of the ambulance call. After Tom is taken away Jenny proceeds to cover her grandmother's face with peanut butter in order to cause a fatal allergic reaction, thoroughly explaining all the symptoms to her. Eventually Jenny starts calling for George. After Jenny continues to threaten her grandmother's life, \\"George\\" suddenly stands in the doorway trying to talk Jenny into giving him the knife she had used to spread the peanut butter on her grandmother's face. As Jenny sees through the deception she pretends to give the knife to \\"George\\" but instead stabs him once near enough. This is when Tom rips off the mask and parts of the cloak, bleeding severely. Jenny then proceeds to explain to Tom that George was never talking and even her grandmother would have known that. As she asks Tom to give back the knife, he removes it from his shoulder/chest and threatens Jenny. That is when Jenny starts to sob, asking Tom whether he wanted to hurt and kill her and then turning to and embracing her grandmother, asking for forgiveness, and waiting for the stab. A cut concludes the scene and the story resumes six months later. Jenny is seen typing a letter to her grandmother on a laptop computer inside a clinic. She mentions that she admires her grandma's courage to be on stage in a wheelchair and saying that those weird memories were all far away as she hears the sounds of a man tap-dancing outside. Looking out of the window she notices the van driver who had hit the thief in the introductory scene and ran off back then. She decides to punish him for his crime but is interrupted when \\"George\\" drives by on a bike to punish the driver. \\"George\\" leaves the scenery without a word and as Jenny returns into the clinic George's bike lies in the hallway and water with blood is shown running out under a nearby door. Jenny enters the room and finds a bathtub with the wolf mask floating on the water. When she submerges her head to see what or who is in the bathtub her father appears out of the water. He is all mutilated and looks like a zombie with his gun wound. The film concludes with Jenny and her father singing Que Sera, Sera.

French Revolutionary Wars Born in Aurillac in 1775, Delzons enlisted in a battalion of volunteers from the département of the Cantal as a lieutenant of grenadiers. He served in the campaigns of 1792 and 1793 in the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees during which he distinguished himself at Jonquière, where he was wounded, and in the Siege of Rosas. Transferred to the Army of Italy, Delzons distinguished himself at Montenotte, Dego and Lodi. Captured near Mantua he was exchanged eight days later. After having distinguished himself in the Battle of Rivoli, Delzons was promoted to chef de bataillon on the field of battle. Taking part in Napoleon Bonaparte’s Egyptian campaign, at the age of 23 Delzons was promoted to the command of a demi-brigade. Napoleonic Wars Promoted to general of brigade upon his return to France, Delzons took part in the campaigns of 1805 and 1806. Serving under Auguste de Marmont, Delzons took part in the 1809 Dalmatian campaign. On 15 February 1811 Delzons was promoted to general of division.

It is originally from Southeast China.  Description  Tree with fruit Pterocarya stenoptera is quite similar to P. fraxinifolia. The major difference lies in the shape of the wings on the fruit: reminiscent of the wings of the common fly, they are connected to the two sides of the walnut shaped fruit, which is about the size of a chickpea. The wings lie in two different planes. The fruits develop in the summer on 2.5 cm long catkins, hanging from the distinctly differently textured green foliage. The fruiting catkins are frequently considered desirable from a landscaping perspective. The foliage is dense, though it can be thinned by pruning. The alternate deciduous leaves are pinnately compound, bearing odd numbers of elliptic-oblong pinnately-veined leaflets with serrate margins. The bark on the trunk is similar to P. fraxinifolia, but is smoother. The tree grows rapidly under optimal conditions, easily reaching 70 feet with substantial spreading branches. One tree in Raleigh grew to 25 feet in only six years, with a trunk diameter of fourteen inches. Trunk diameters as large as eight feet have been reported.E. F. Gilman and D. G.

Germination is epigeal and typically requires a little more than ten days. The first true (pinnately compound) leaves appear after the seedling reaches a height of ~6 cm. The young seedlings do well under half-shade and a temperature of ~18 °C (64 °F). Pterocarya stenoptera can also be propagated by cuttings.  Uses  Used in East Asian classical garden design.

It is a plant of vernally wet and flooded areas near the waterways of the valley, habitat which has been altered and in some areas eliminated by human activity. It is also a member of the flora in the rare alkali sink habitat of the delta.Species Account. Bay-Delta Conservation Plan . November 7, 2008. The plant has no federal listing but it is listed as an endangered species on the California state level. There are 26 reported occurrences of the plant, but several of these have been extirpated. Threats to the species include habitat destruction via alteration of water regimes and water diversion, changes to waterways by dredging and other maintenance activities, conversion of land to agriculture, and non-native plant species. The plant relies on the seasonal flooding that would occur naturally in the delta; this flooding is strictly contained and prevented today. Description Eryngium racemosum is a mostly prostrate perennial herb with a slender, branching stem spreading to a maximum length near half a meter. The stem may root at nodes that come in contact with moist soil. The serrated or lobed leaves have blades a few centimeters long and are borne on longer petioles. The inflorescence is a raceme of rounded or oval flower heads, each surrounded by five long, narrow, spiny bracts.

The society is formally recognised by the German state as an environmental and conservation society, a body responsible for public issues (Träger öffentlicher Belange), and must therefore be consulted over issues affecting the ecology. NABU has about 530,000 members () as active conservationists or supporters. They are organised into more than 1,800 local groups across Germany. NABU is the national partner organisation of BirdLife International. The organisation is one of the most significant members of the German umbrella organization of the German conservation movement Deutscher Naturschutzring (DNR).  History  The NABU was founded by Lina Hähnle on 1 February 1899 in Stuttgart as the Bund für Vogelschutz (BfV). In 1990 the BfV merged with former DDR Naturschutz society to Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU). Since then, the focus got broader and NABU built up divisions for international conservation projects, marine conservation and energy sufficiency.

In its formation, most of the selling is completed in the early stage by big players and the participation is from general public in the later stage.

Bairstow was part of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup. A right-hand batsman, he is the only England wicket-keeper to twice claim nine dismissals in a Test match, against South Africa in January 2016, and against Sri Lanka in May 2016. Only Jack Russell (11 dismissals versus South Africa, 1995), and Bob Taylor (10 dismissals versus India 1980) have claimed more in a single Test match. In 2016, Bairstow set a new record for the most dismissals (70) by a wicket-keeper in a calendar year. In the same year, Bairstow also set a record for most runs in Test matches by a wicket-keeper in a single year. By scoring 1,470 runs in Tests in the year, Bairstow almost doubled the previous record of 777 for England wicket-keepers set by Matt Prior in 2012, and comprehensively surpassed the former record for any Test country of 1,045 runs, held by former Zimbabwe wicket-keeper Andy Flower. He is the first England cricketer to score three consecutive one-day international hundreds. Early life Born in Bradford, West Yorkshire in 1989, Bairstow displayed his early talent when he was chosen as the inaugural winner of the Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year award.

England =Breaking into the ODI and T20I teams – early career= Bairstow was a member of the England ODI squad for their match against Ireland in August 2011; however, he was not picked to play. He did make his debut the following month after he was called up to the final ODI against India. Playing as a specialist batsman, he scored an unbeaten 41 off just 21 balls to help England reach a Duckworth-Lewis adjusted total. His innings included three sixes, the first off just the fifth ball he faced, and he was named Man of the Match. On 11 October 2011, Bairstow hit a century off 53 balls as England beat a Hyderabad Cricket Association XI – during a warm up for a series against India.Jonny Bairstow hits century as England win warm-up game, BBC Sport On 23 February 2012, Bairstow was named man of the match in the second T20 of the series between Pakistan and England at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. England won the match. Bairstow was named in the England squad for the first test against the West Indies at Lord's after a successful start to the 2012 season, scoring two hundreds for Yorkshire, and an injury to Ravi Bopara had ruled him out of selection. On 17 May 2012, Bairstow was selected in the team and made his test debut and was presented his cap by close family friend and former Yorkshire and England cricketer, Geoff Boycott. Bairstow was selected to play for the England Lions in one of the warm up games for this series. He came in as the 7th batsman and scored 50 runs before being caught by Ravi Rampaul. Bairstow also made 5 catches throughout the match. Bairstow made his debut in the 1st Test against the West Indies at Lord's. Bairstow's first major involvement in the test was when he caught Marlon Samuels for 31 runs. Bairstow came in as the Number 6 batsman in England's 1st innings and made 16 runs off 27 balls hitting 3 fours however he was out from an LBW bowled by Kemar Roach. Bairstow finished the series on a positive note (with England taking the series 2–0) and with an overall score of 38 runs. Bairstow was not selected for the first two Tests as England went with Ravi Bopara (for the 1st Test) and handed James Taylor his debut in the 2nd Test for the 2012 South Africa series. However, he was recalled to the side for the 3rd Test and he made 95 in the first innings against South Africa before being bowled by an excellent ball from fast bowler Morne Morkel. He left the field to a standing ovation. In the second innings, England were set 345 to win, Bairstow came in with England struggling (Jonathan Trott was the only batsman to get into double figures) and he played some good shots but finally was bowled by Imran Tahir for 54 runs, this was not enough to help England to victory and South Africa won the match and won the series 2–0. He finished the Test series with 149 runs (the 5th highest scoring England player) having only played 1 Test. Bairstow was then dropped for the first ODI in favour of Ravi Bopara who had an excellent ODI series against Australia. Bairstow was selected in the England squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. Jonny played in England's first group game against Afghanistan, he came in as the number 6 batsman and made 12 runs from 10 balls before being caught to help England to get 196 runs for 5 wickets. In Afghanistan's chase he caught Asghar Stanikzai off a Stuart Broad ball to assist England to a 116 run victory. The second and final group game was against India, England won the toss and sent India in to bat. Bairstow caught Virat Kohli from a Graeme Swann ball when Kohli was on 40, however India got to 170 runs in 20 overs setting England a target of 171. England's batting order failed and Jonny was bowled by Piyush Chawla for 1 run, England only made 80 runs (which was their worst for a Twenty20 International) and lost the match by 90 runs. They still qualified for the Super 8 stage. The first match in the Super 8's was against eventual champions West Indies, Bairstow took an important wicket when he caught opener Johnson Charles on 84 off of a Jade Dernbach bowl. He made amends against New Zealand as he caught opener Rob Nicol for 11 runs and then helped run out James Franklin who was on 50 and looking to really threaten England, Bairstow was needed in the 18th over and made 5 runs in 2 balls to help England to a 6 wicket win. Bairstow was selected as the wicket keeper against Sri Lanka, he caught Kumar Sangakkara on 13 but his performance as the number 3 batter was poor as he only made 2 runs on the way to a 19 runs loss to Sri Lanka. This loss meant England were knocked out of the World Twenty20 and the West Indies took England's title as World Twenty20 champions. Bairstow was included in the squad which travelled to India. Bairstow was selected to play in the 2nd Test after Ian Bell went home for the birth of his child. His first involvement of the test series came when he caught Zaheer Khan (India's last wicket) from a Graeme Swann bowl. He came in to bat as the 5th batsmen however he only managed 9 runs before he was caught by Gautam Gambhir, however Bairstow's dismissal was full of controversy as the ball hit the catcher's helmet first. Jonny continued to do well in the fielding department by catching India's dangerman Cheteshwar Pujara (who had scored a double century in the 1st Test and a century in the 1st Innings of the 2nd Test) for 6 runs which put England on the front foot in the 2nd Test. He also caught Yuvraj Singh off a Monty Panesar bowl. However he was dropped for the 3rd Test as Ian Bell returned to the tour following the birth of his child. He was selected for the T20 and ODI teams however he withdrew from both squads due to the illness of a family member , he was replaced by fellow Yorkshire man Joe Root on both occasions. =2013 to 2014= He was selected to be part of the Test, ODI and T20 squads for the 2013 Tour to New Zealand. Bairstow was chosen to play in the first Twenty20 match of the series, he lost the wicket-keeping spot to Jos Buttler after Buttler put in a couple of great performances in the warm ups, this meant Bairstow would be used as specialist batsman coming in at number 5. He helped England to a 40 run win in the 1st T20I by smashing 38 runs in 22 balls before being caught by Martin Guptill, he also caught New Zealand danger man Ross Taylor on 13. In the 2nd T20I he caught Ross Taylor on 4 runs and also Colin Munro on 7 runs. Bairstow also played in the 3rd T20I, whilst fielding he caught both Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor before they could post a decent score, he was not required to bat in England's successful run chase and finished up a 2–1 T20 series winner. He was selected as the number 6 batsman for the 3rd Test as Kevin Pietersen was injured so Joe Root moved up to number 5 and struggled with innings of 3 and 6. Not long after the series in New Zealand the Black Caps travelled to tour round England. Bairstow was selected in the ODI squad for the New Zealand's 2013 tour of England. His first involvement in the tour was to play for the England Lions against New Zealand in a four-day warm up match, where he batted at number 6 and got 68 runs before getting out to an LBW. He was selected for the 1st Test at number 6 due to the absence of Kevin Pietersen. He top scored for England in the 1st innings after getting 41 runs off 107 balls. Bairstow retained his place for the 2nd Test at Headingley where he came in and hit 64 off 99 balls and was involved in a 124 partnership with fellow Yorkshireman Joe Root. In the second innings, he made 26 off 22 balls before Alastair Cook declared. Bairstow finished the series with 136 runs (England's 4th highest scorer) as England won the series 2–0. Bairstow batting against Australia in the 1st Test of the 2013 Ashes series at Trent Bridge For the 2013 Ashes series, Bairstow was named in the squad as Nick Compton was dropped which allowed Joe Root to open the batting and leaving the number six spot free for Bairstow. .

In the 2nd Test, he made 67 off 146 balls in the first innings and 20 runs in the second innings helping England gain a 2–0 series lead. Bairstow was selected in the 2013-14 Ashes series squad however he did not play a match until he was called up to the team for the 4th Test. With England 3–0 down in the series Jonny replaced wicket-keeper Matt Prior after a poor run of form making Bairstow and his father the first father/son combination to keep wicket for England. In the 4th Test Jonny took 6 catches and performed well behind wicket but he could only get 10 runs in the first innings and 21 in the second innings. He finished the series with 49 runs. =2015 – becoming Test wicket- keeper= After being out of the England set up for 18 months, Bairstow was called up to the squad for the 5th ODI in New Zealand's tour of England. He replaced the injured Jos Buttler in the team and made two catches and a stumping before scoring 83* in 60 balls to help England to a win in a rain affected match.

In the fourth Test he scored 74 as England won the match by an innings and 78 runs. Bairstow kept his place in the England side for the series against Pakistan in the UAE in 2015.

Bairstow scored 43 in England's first innings of the second Test, as they made 242. After making 41 in the first innings of the final Test, he made his first half-century of the series in his last innings, scoring 79, although it proved to be in vain as England lost to lose the series 2–0.

In the first test of the 2015 -16 South Africa series, Bairstow, batting at number 7, made 41 runs. He followed this with an excellent 79 from 76 balls in the second innings, as England set the hosts a target of 416 to win. England went on to win the game in convincing fashion, by 241 runs.

Bairstow was dropped from England's Test squad for the tour of New Zealand, with England selector Ed Smith saying 'He does drop out of the Test squad for these two Tests in New Zealand, which are not part of the World Test Championship, and I predict he'll come back stronger for having had a bit of time away from the Test set- up', leaving open the possibility of a return, amidst calls for Bairstow to work on his technique in red ball cricket. Bairstow returned to the team as a cover for the unwell Ollie Pope, making 9 and 25 before again being dropped from the side on Pope's return. Bairstow was already in South Africa at a training camp working on his red ball technique.

It is one of only four villages located within the United Nations Buffer Zone, the other three being Pyla, Athienou and Troulloi.  Demographics  Historically, Deneia has been a mixed village. In the Ottoman census of 1831, the village had a Turkish Cypriot majority, with 17 Turkish Cypriot and 8 Greek Cypriot male inhabitants recorded. However, in 1891, both ethnic groups constituted half the village's population, with 82 Turkish Cypriot and 84 Greek Cypriots. Between 1891 and 1946, the village's Turkish Cypriot population did not increase, whilst the Greek Cypriot population continually increased. In 1960, Greek Cypriots constituted 61.5% of the population of 324 people (196 Greek Cypriots, 128 Turkish Cypriots). The Turkish Cypriots of the village fled to secure Turkish Cypriot enclaves in Fotta, Krini, Ortaköy and Lefka in 1964, in the wake of intercommunal violence. During the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, Greek Cypriot inhabitants also fled the village as the Turkish army advanced to the village, but they returned after the army withdrew. Turkish Cypriot inhabitants were relocated to Şirinevler (Agios Ermolaos), where they were given land. Today, the original Greek Cypriot inhabitants live in the village, while the Turkish Cypriot quarter lies in ruins.

She directed seven films between 1969 and 2003. In 1978, she was a member of the jury at the 28th Berlin International Film Festival. Her 1982 film Heart and Guts was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival.  Early career and documentary work  Ana Carolina Teixeira Soares attended school with the intention of becoming a doctor, but instead changed direction and became a filmmaker.Foster, G. (1995). Women film directors: An International Bio-critical Dictionary. Westport, Conn.: [null Greenwood Press.] Pg. 66 She graduated in 1964 from University of São Paulo Med School. Several years later she went to a School of Physiotherapy, taking special interest in university politics. She also spent a few of her early years in a Renaissance band called \\"Musikantiga\\".Carolina, Ana. \\"Ana Carolina\\". Enciclopédia Itaú Cultural, enciclopedia.itaucultural.org.br/pessoa547907/ana-carolina. She was highly focused in her early years as a filmmaker, as she made 11 documentaries in her first eight years in the business (her first being in 1967, last in 1974). These early documentaries had a heavy focus on workers. Ana Carolina also had interest in the world of labour, as she created several documentaries that revolved around labourers and unions (Lavra-dor 1968, Pantanal 1971). At the same time, some of these documentaries focused more on artistic practices (Três Desenhos 1970, Monteiro Lobato 1970).  Feature films  She is better known for her feature films, however. Her earliest works includes a trilogy that consists of films that all speak to social and political conditions in Brazil, her place of birth. They were supported by Embrafilme. Despite the common connection that they all speak to the conditions surrounding her in Brazil, these films all present themselves in very different ways. Her first film released in 1977 was titled Mar de Rosas, translated into Everything is Fine. The film is shot from a feminist perspective with interpretations open to the viewer. Mar de Rosas tells the story of a woman that slits her husband's throat and flees with her child. It provides commentary on patriarchy and feminist discontent. This discontent is not strictly limited to the characters within the fictional landscape and speaks much more broadly to the nation at whole. Her second film, Das Tripas Caração (1982) – which translates into With the Heart in the Hands- is an off-beat film that examines sexual interactions as well as homophobia. It depicts a male detective's perverse dreams that include intervention in lesbian relationships and impregnating a female teacher. As described in Women Film Directors, \\"Carolina’s work is, in some ways, comparable to Pedro Almodovar's, but Carolina’s use of camp horror is that of a distinctly feminist lens\\".Foster, G. (1995). Women film directors: An International Bio-critical Dictionary. Westport, Conn.: [null Greenwood Press.] Pg. 67 The final film in the trilogy is titled Sonho de Valsa (1986) – which translates into Dream Waltz. The protagonist in the film is a female, named Tereza, that has chaotic dreams of a Prince Charming dressed in medieval costume. It continues on Carolina's theme of sexual examination, and does so particularly by her interactions with the male role models in her life.Marsh, Leslie Louise. 2008. \\"Embodying Citizenship in Brazilian Women's Film, Video, and Literature, 1971 to 1988.\\" Order No. 3343154, University of Michigan. Pg. 199–201  Carolina's take on her work  In an interview based on audacity in cinema, Carolina had much to say in regards to the censorship she faced in her time making films in Brazil. She uses words such as hysterical and neurotic to describe the impact it had on her production of films. She claims that the limitations placed on her work actually caused her to be more rebellious and this influenced her work to be even more provocative. She goes on to admit that her work in Mar de Rosas is meant to be interpreted as an allusion to the outside world.Vivian Schelling, \\"Ana Carolina Teixeira: Audacity in the Cinema,\\" Index on Censorship 14.5 (1985): 60.  Impact  Carolina had a highly influential role as a filmmaker in one of the most restrictive times in Brazil, the Military Dictatorship (1964–1985). Her battle against censorship trail-blazed a better path to social and political commentary in film. She fought against the censorship of films, but also the censorship of ideas.

It was released on June 8, 2009 for iPhone and iPod Touch, and later a HD version was released for the iPad, which featured improved graphics to take full advantage of the iPad's capabilities. The game was a critical and commercial success, and has led to two sequels; Real Racing 2 in 2010 and Real Racing 3 in 2013. Gameplay left The player is given five different control methods from which to choose: Method A features accelerometer steering (tilting the physical device to the left to turn left and to the right to turn right), auto accelerate and manual brake; Method B features accelerometer steering, manual accelerate and manual brake; Method C features touch to steer (where the player touches the left side of the touchscreen to turn left, and the right side to turn right), auto accelerate and manual brake; Method D features a virtual on-screen steering wheel to steer, auto accelerate and manual brake; Method E features a virtual steering wheel to steer, manual accelerate and manual brake. Within each of these options, the player can modify the amount of brake assist. In Methods A and B, the accelerometer sensitivity can also be modified. In career mode, the player begins with only one available race; a \\"Hatch qualifier\\", in which they must complete a single lap in under one minute fifteen seconds to qualify for the next race. As each race is cleared, the next race becomes available. The game is divided into four sections, determined by the type of car; \\"Hatch\\", \\"Sedan\\", \\"Muscle\\" and \\"Exotic\\". Each section is further divided into three levels of difficulty; \\"Class C\\" is the easiest, followed by \\"Class B\\", with \\"Class A\\" being the hardest. Career races can include up to five AI opponents. Other ways to play include a quick race, open time trials (which are connected to online leaderboards using Firemint's Cloudcell technology), local multiplayer and online trial leagues. A six player online multiplayer mode is also available. Cars and locations There are forty-eight different cars to choose from in the game, although with the exception of two Volkswagen GTIs, none are officially licensed. There are twelve different fictional tracks on which to race. Real Racing GTI In October 2009, Firemint released Real Racing GTI. A limited edition free version of the full game, GTI was made in cooperation with Volkswagen as a way to promote their newly unveiled 2010 GTI model. The game featured only three tracks, and six selectable cars, all models of GTI. Originally conceived by AKQA, GTI proved very successful, with over four million downloads.

It has also been presented with the subtitle \\"Mock-Modesty Display'd and Punish'd.\\" Response to Pamela The Anti-Pamela is one of several novels (such as Shamela by Henry Fielding) written in response to Richardson's novel Pamela, satirising the innocence of his character Pamela Andrews. The original Pamela is presented as a virtuous working-class woman who reforms a debauched gentleman and wins his love; her virtue is rewarded with marriage. Fiction written in response to this novel typically reframes Pamela's actions to instead present her as a manipulative social climber. Haywood's character generally follows this mold, though she is much less licentious than Fielding's Shamela. Haywood's novel is generally seen as condemning Richardson's Pamela character for using her sexuality for self- interested ends. Some scholars also interpret the novel as condemning the idea of social mobility itself, and supporting the idea that there is a natural ruling elite whose innate moral superiority can never be matched by lower classes. Plot Unlike Shamela, which retells the same plot as Pamela, Haywood's novel follows the life of a Pamela-esque character, Syrena Tricksy, in her own storyline. Syrena attempts to use her performance of innocence to become a prosperous noblewoman. She tries several different schemes, presenting herself to different men as a unmarried gentlewoman, a married gentlewoman, a libertine, a mistress, a poor widow, or a rich widow, based on what seems likely to serve her aims. However, these schemes are always foiled at the last minute, either due to coincidence or due to Syrena's carelessness. For example, she is almost successful in marrying a rich old gentleman, until his son visits and reveals that Syrena has pursued both father and son. As the novel progresses, Syrena's desperate attempts at upward social mobility instead result in downward mobility, as she seduces men with less and less wealth.

It was last assigned to the 81st Fighter-Bomber Wing at RAF Bentwaters, England. It was inactivated on 8 February 1955. History : For additional history, see 81st Training Wing =World War II= World War II 81st Group emblem The unit was constituted as the 81st Pursuit Group (Intercepter) on 13 January 1942, and activated on 9 February 1942, with the 91st, 92d, and 93d Pursuit Squadrons assigned. It was redesignated 81st Fighter Group in May 1942 and trained with Bell P-39 Airacobras. The group moved overseas between October 1942 and February 1943, the ground echelon arriving in French Morocco with the force that invaded North Africa on 8 November, and the air echelon, which had trained for a time in England, arriving in North Africa between late December 1942 and early February 1943. Te group began combat with Twelfth Air Force in January 1943. It supported ground operations during the Allied drive against Axis forces in Tunisia. The group patrolled the coast of North Africa and protected Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea in April through July 1943 and provided cover for the convoys that landed troops on Pantelleria on 11 June and on Sicily on 10 July 1943. The group supported the landings at Anzio on 22 January 1944 and flew patrols in that area for a short time. Group aircraft from its time in England through its action Italy consisted of P-39s and the British export version, the P-400. P-400s still had RAF camouflage and five digit alphanumeric serial number, RAF pilot's harness, and a 20 mm cannon versus the US 37 mm. These P-39s and P-400s were available due to a Murmansk Convoy so devastated, it turned back. The fighters were uncrated, assembled and test flown by the pilots that would take them to North Africa, Sicily and Italy. The 81st also flew P-38 Lightnings on patrol in the Mediterranean. These aircraft were loaned from the 1st Fighter Group. The flight of the P-39/400s of the 81st and 350th Fighter Groups to Morocco, is still in the Guinness Book of Records, as the largest flight over the greatest distance. A few of these Aircraft \\"experienced engine problems\\" and landed in Lisbon, Portugal. Perhaps the Pilots were hoping to sit out the duration. The Portuguese government kept these Fighters and handed the pilots over to the U.S. Embassy. These pilots flew \\"Tail-end Charlie\\" for most of the rest of their tour. It is notable that the 81st suffered the lowest loss rate of any Fighter Group in the MTO. This is a testament that the Bell P-39 Airacobra really was a capable fighter. Please visit the \\"81st Fighter Group Forum\\" for more detailed info on this remarkable group of men. The group moved to India, February–March 1944, and began training with P-40 and P-47 aircraft. It then moved to China in May and became part of Fourteenth Air Force. The group continued training and on occasion flew patrol and escort missions before returning to full-time combat duty in January 1945. It attacked enemy airfields and installations, flew escort missions, and aided the operations of Chinese ground forces by attacking troop concentrations, ammunition dumps, lines of communications, and other targets to hinder Japanese efforts to move men and material to the front. The 81st was inactivated in China on 27 December 1945. =Cold War=  Pacific Air Command  Postwar 81st Group emblem 81st FG F-47N 44-8800 over Hawaii about 1949 The 81st Fighter Group, Single Engine was reactivated at Wheeler Field, Hawaii Territory on 15 October 1946. It was assigned to the 7th Fighter Wing of Seventh Air Force (7 AF). The mission of the group was to maintain daylight security of the Hawaiian Islands and to train fighter pilots to a state of combat readiness. The 81st FG was formed largely from the personnel and equipment of the 15th Fighter Group which was inactivated at Wheeler Field the same day. The group comprised the 91st, 92d and 93d Fighter Squadrons and assumed the P-51D Mustang aircraft of the former 15th FG. The 81st was faced with the arduous task of training personnel for the transition from a fully staffed wartime organization with an abundance of supplies and equipment (15th FG) into an effective peacetime fighter group with limited resources and facilities. In 1948, the group completed conversion from the P-51 to the P-47D Thunderbolt aircraft. On 15 April 1948 the group was reassigned from the 7th Fighter Wing to the new 81st Fighter Wing (FW) under the Wing/Base (Hobson Plan) reorganization of the Air Force. The 81st FW commanded both the support groups as well as the flying combat 81st Fighter Group and the squadrons assigned to it. On 1 May 1948, the 7th Fighter Wing was redesignated as the 7th Air Division, being moved to England under Strategic Air Command. As a result, the 81st FW came under the direct control of 7 AF, now designated Pacific Air Command.

ConAC was the result of an effort by the new USAF to concentrate all fighter forces deployed within the continental United States to strengthen the air defense of the North American continent. With the establishment of ConAC, Tactical Air Command and Air Defense Command were reduced from major commands to operating agencies under ConAC. Operations at Wheeler were curtailed on 21 May 1949, the 81st and its parent 81 FW being transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC)'s Twelfth Air Force at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. At Kirtland, the group was reequipped with F-80C Shooting Star jet aircraft, and later faster F-86A Sabres, being the third group equipped with the Sabre Jet. Under ConAC, the 81st FW was redesignated as the 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing and was attached to Western Air Defense Force on 19 January 1950, while the group became the 81st Fighter-Interceptor Group (81st FIG). Shortly afterward, on 29 April, the 81st FIG moved to Moses Lake AFB, Washington, its mission changed from training for worldwide deployment under TAC to performing air defense of Eastern Washington, primarily the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. The 93d FIS remained at Kirtland and was reassigned to another wing. On 1 January 1951, ConAC's mission was limited to support of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard forces, and Air Defense Command (ADC) returned to major command status and the 81st became part of the new command. On 10 February, the 116th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from the Washington Air National Guard was called to active federal service as a result of the Korean War, and was assigned as one of the squadrons of the 81st FIG, replacing the 93d which had remained at Kirtland when the group moved in 1950. The 116th remained at its home station, Geiger Field, WA and was upgraded to F-86A Sabres. In addition the wing began receiving additional personnel though the activation of Air Force Reserve units, and the wing was brought up to its authorized strength for the first time since its activation. United States Air Forces in Europe 91st TFS F-84F 52-6852 After fourteen months at now renamed Larson Air Force Base, the 81st FIG received movement orders to deploy to England. The 81st FIG deployed to two RAF Stations, built for use during World War II and laid out in a decentralized or dispersed plan. One being RAF Bentwaters, the other being RAF Shepherds Grove, both located in East Anglia about forty miles apart. The bulk of the ground station buildings were the metal Nissen hut type, with some wood frame and tar paper buildings, and were grouped together in numbered \\"sites\\", widely separated to blend into natural, rustic surroundings for purposes of camouflage. The main administrative building and clubs were of the larger Quonset hut type. On 1 August 1951, the initial 81st aircraft flew into RAF Shepherds Grove. The group was located at Bentwaters, and worked with Royal Air Force Fighter Command to provide air defense of Great Britain. It was the first F-86 equipped unit in Europe. On 1 November 1952, the federalized 116th FIS was returned to the National Guard and its personnel and equipment transferred to the newly activated 78th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. In early 1953, the 92d FIS deployed to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, Germany to identify unknown aircraft penetrating the US Zone of Occupation after a Czech MiG-15 shot down a Republic F-84 in the US Zone. In April 1954, it changed its mission from air defense to ground attack as the 81st Fighter-Bomber Group and converted to Republic F-84 Aircraft to perform this mission. It was inactivated when United States Air Forces Europe reorganized its nuclear capable wings in the United Kingdom on the dual deputy/support group model and its squadrons were assigned directly to the 81st Fighter-Bomber Wing. =Lineage= * Constituted as 81st Pursuit Group (Interceptor) on 13 January 1942 : Activated on 9 February 1942 : Redesignated: 81st Fighter Group (Single Engine) on 15 May 1942 : Inactivated on 27 December 1945 * Activated on 15 October 1946 : Redesignated 81st Fighter Group, Jet on 29 July 1949 : Redesignated: 81st Fighter-Interceptor Group on 1 January 1950 : Redesignated: 81st Fighter-Bomber Group on 1 April 1954 : Inactivated on 8 February 1955 * Redesignated 81st Tactical Fighter Group on 31 July 1985 (remained inactive). =Assignments= * III Fighter Command, 9 February 1942 * IV Fighter Command, 28 June 1942 * 7th Fighter Wing: 27 September 1942 * Twelfth Air Force, 5 January 1943 * Tenth Air Force, 2 March 1944 : Attached to Fourteenth Air Force, 2 March – 12 May 1944 : Attached to 312th Fighter Wing, 12 May 1944 – 1 October 1945 * Seventh Air Force 15 October 1946 * 7th Air Division, 1 May 1946 * 81st Fighter Wing (later 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, 81st Fighter- Bomber Wing), 1 May 1948 – 8 February 1955 =Components= * 78th Fighter- Interceptor (later Fighter-Bomber) Squadron: 1 November 1952 – 8 February 1955 * 91st Pursuit (later Fighter-Interceptor, Fighter Bomber) Squadron: 9 February 1942 – 27 December 1945; 15 October 1946 – 8 February 1955 * 92d Pursuit (later Fighter-Interceptor, Fighter Bomber) Squadron: 9 February 1942 – 27 December 1945; 15 October 1946 – 8 February 1955 * 93d Pursuit (later Fighter-Interceptor) Squadron: 9 February 1942 – 27 December 1945; 15 October 1946 – 1 May 1950 * 116th Fighter Squadron, Jet (later, 116th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron): 10 February 1951 – 1 November 1952 : Federalized Washington Air National Guard =Stations= * Morris Field, North Carolina, February 1942 * Dale Mabry Field, Florida, c. 1 May 1942 * Muroc Army Air Field, California, c. 28 June – 4 October 1942 * Mediouna Airfield, French Morocco, c. 5 January 1943 * Thelepte Airfield, Tunisia, 22 January 1943 * Le Kouif Airfield, Algeria, 17 February 1943 * Youks-les-Bains Airfield, Algeria, 22 February 1943 * Le Kouif Airfield, Algeria, 24 February 1943 * Thelepte Airfield, Tunisia, c.

It is situated on the south eastern slopes of the Troodos Mountains, approximately 40 km southwest of Nicosia. The village today is almost deserted. It's connected by two roads, one from Klirou and the other of Kalo Chorio Klirou. Nearby are also the traditional Lazanias village and the Machairas Monastery. The village is owned by the Department of Antiquities, which in 1978 has been declared as a World Heritage Site. History Between 400AD – 800AD there was a lot of turmoil in the island's history due to anti- pagan legislations and Arab invasions. This led to dissident groups forming to avoid oppression and establish the rule of the sword as the basic tool for survival in this mountainous region. The original name of the Makhairas mountains came from the Greek term “to fight”. According to legend, the region was controlled by two dominant clans: the Kourries from the Kourion area (in control of the East side of the mountain) and the Braves from the Tamassos area (who were in control of the West side of the mountain). In 700 AD a large number of Cypriots who were war prisoners repatriated from Cyzicus Propontis joined and strengthened the power of the fugitive groups in the region, forcing the government to pardon these outlaws. The name of Fikardou village was, according to this version, taken from the Greek: φυγά ανδρείου: fugitive braves' clan: Fikanrdrou. A more plausible etymology would perhaps be φυγά άνδρον: den of fugitives. However, historical research Nasa Potapiou: The Fikardou family of Cyprus points to a different origin: the family name of the feudal overlords of the area, dating back to Lusignan times. The earliest mention of the family is found after the 1450s. In 1473 Thomas Fikardos is mentioned as the royal chancellor present at the deathbed of James II. He is believed to be the patriarch of the family associated with the feudal history of the village. Indeed, many villages in Cyprus are former feudal holdings with names traceable to the Franks, Venetians and others, namely the nearby villages of Gourri (Urry family), and Lazania (Lusignan).In any case, this version is extremely unlikely to be exact, as the village administratively belonged to Machairas Monastery, during Komnenos dynasty (1081-1185). According to Monastery sources in that period, fruits and olive-tree plantations had been established in its fiefdom of Lythrodontas and one of the main profitable activities of the Fikardou inhabitants were the harvesting Olea oleaster (young wild olive trees) from the forest. The Knights Templar administrated most of the region of Pitsilia from 1195 to 1310. With the criminal prosecutions of the Templars as hereticshttp://www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/history/17c.htm The Knights of St. John inherited their privileges including Fikardou.

Biography =Early life= Born July 18, 1837, at Tharoiseau, Yonne, France, Dom Isidore Robot, O.S.B., entered the nearby Benedictine monastery of Sainte-Marie de la Pierre-qui- Vire. He was professed as a monk in 1859 and ordained a priest in 1862. After the fall of Emperor Napoleon III in 1870, anticlerical laws enacted under the French Third Republic began closing convents and monasteries throughout France. As Robot's monastery was among those threatened, he and a companion, Brother Dominic Lambert, were sent by their abbot to find a place of refuge for the community. They left for the United States, arriving in French- speaking Louisiana in 1873, seeking a fresh start.Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture \\"Robot, Isidore (1837-1887)\\" =Prefect of Indian Territory= At that time, the spiritual care of the newly established Indian Territory was under the supervision of the Diocese of Little Rock in Arkansas. The Archbishop of New Orleans, the Most Rev. Napoléon-Joseph Perché, in whose ecclesiastical province the whole region lay, recommended to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith that Robot and his monastic community take charge of this region as a Prefecture Apostolic, a quasi- independent jurisdiction. With this charge, Robot and Lambert arrived in the territory in October 1875 and established themselves in the town of Atoka. They were the first Catholic missionaries to settle permanently in Oklahoma. They were not, however, the very first, as the town was the site of the first Catholic church in the Territory, which, under the patronage of St. Patrick, had been founded in 1872 by the Rev. Michael Smyth, assisted by his brother, the Rev. Lawrence Smyth, who were natives of Ireland. The church was built by and for the Irish-born workers of the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad who lived in the town and various local residents, including a leader of the Choctaw, Benjamin Franklin Smallwood.Archdiocese of Oklahoma City: Benedictine Beginning 1875-1891 The Prefecture was formally erected by the Holy See as of 14 May 1876,Catholic Hierarchy.com Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the official documents were sent from the Vatican in July 1876, reaching Robot two months later. One of Robot's principal concerns continued to be a new monastery for his French brethren. To this end, he obtained a section of land from the Potawatomi Nation in exchange for his promise of a church and school. Here he laid the foundation for what would become Sacred Heart Mission and Abbey (today the Abbey of St. Gregory), in present Pottawatomie County. In 1880 he obtained five Religious Sisters from New Orleans to teach in his school for girls. In 1884 these were replaced by Sisters of Mercy from Lacon, Illinois, whose ministry in Oklahoma has continued ever since. As a missionary, Robot's focus was on American Indians, especially the Potawatomis and the Osages, and the coal miners working for the Choctaw Nation. These last were a polyglot mixture, with Irish and Italians predominating. In 1884 he opened Oklahoma's second Catholic parish church, Our Lady of Good Counsel, at Lehigh. A brusque and uncompromising man, Robot seems to have alienated parishioners and fellow monks alike. Replaced as monastic superior in 1882 (though not as prefect), he moved in 1884 to McAlester, where he built a cabin that served as a chapel and residence. Through all the years of his leadership of the Territory, Robot maintained the ascetic regimen of monastic life, rising for prayer at 3 A.M. and fasting constantly. In 1885 he established parishes at Krebs and Savanna. In late 1884 Robot attended the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, one of the defining gatherings by American bishops for the Catholic Church in the United States. From there he traveled to Rome, where he submitted his resignation as Prefect. He then returned to McAlester. In 1887 his resignation was finally accepted, and his replacement, Dom Ignatius Jean, O.S.B., arrived from France in November. =Death= Robot died on February 15, 1887, in Dallas, Texas, where he was visiting a friend. He was buried in the parish cemetery at Krebs, but in 1900 his remains were transferred to the monastic cemetery at Sacred Heart Abbey.

In the 1990s, organizing against the Gulf War and in response to the murder of Johnny Gammage by police, among other projects, were undertaken. With the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Center became central in organizing Pittsburgh's large anti-war protests and most recently served to facilitate and organize many of the educational and protest activities in September 2009 against and in response to the G20 Summit, including the Peoples' March, which was one of the largest protests in Pittsburgh in decades. Several local institutions grew out of the Center, including the Pittsburgh chapter of Amnesty International and the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Currently the center has active campaigns focused on building the New Economy Working Group movement, integrating the work of environmental justice groups locally, and creating a more peaceful world by working to end wars globally. The Thomas Merton Award, a peace prize, has been awarded since 1972 by the Center. Past recipients include Dorothy Day, Noam Chomsky, Vandana Shiva, Martin Sheen and Fr. Roy Bourgeois. Current Structure Its current structure includes a Board of Directors, committees, affiliates, friends, projects, and members. Membership dues and donations provide much of the funding and the Board of Directors are elected to make decisions related to governance of policies at the Center. Several of the most active projects include Book 'Em, a books for prisoners program; the Environmental Justice Committee, the Pittsburgh Darfur Coalition, Haiti Solidarity, the Pittsburgh Chapter of Code Pink, Roots of Promise, Marcellus Protest Group, Fed Up! the Pittsburgh chapter of the Human Rights Coalition, and The East End Community Thrift Shop, which provides clothing and household items for low-income individuals in the area. The Thomas Merton Center has four key focus areas: peace and non-violence; human rights; environmental justice; and economic justice. The Thomas Merton Center also acts as a fiscal umbrella for a number of smaller organizations that align with the peace and justice mission of the center. To name a few, Book'em Books for Prisoner program, Haiti Solidarity, Pittsburgh Progressive Notebook, Fight for Lifers West, Human Rights Coalition Fed' Up, Pittsburgh Darfur Coalition, Roots of Promise, Marcellus Protest Group, and Westmoreland Marcellus Protest Group. Publication The Thomas Merton Center publishes a monthly newspaper entitled The New People. It is a peace and justice newspaper for Pittsburgh and the Tri-State area. Published 11 times a year, \\"it fills the voids left by the mainstream media by providing an outlet that reflects progressive and alternative politics: locally, nationally and globally.\\" The paper reports on the issues of war, poverty, racism and oppression, by focusing on the non- violent struggle to bring about a more peaceful and just world. The New People also acts as an organizing tool for Thomas Merton Center members and the activist community.

He founded and was Colonel of the 3rd New York Infantry Regiment, and later served with the US Army's 18th and 9th Infantry regiments, where he was brevetted a brigadier general. Townsend served three terms as Adjutant General of New York from 1857–1861, and again in 1880. Early life Frederick Townsend was born in Albany, New York on 21 September 1825 to Isaiah and Hannah Townsend. He was the grandson of Solomon Townsend, a ship's captain during the American Revolution, and great grandson of Samuel Townsend a member of the New York provincial congress and of the committee appointed to prepare a form of government for the state of New York. His ancestors Henry Townsend and Henry's brother John immigrated to Massachusetts from Norfolk England in 1640 and settled at Jamaica on Long Island NY, and were founding members of Oyster Bay Long Island. Townsend had 7 brothers and 2 sisters. There was a strong military bent in the family, as one brother, Franklin Townsend was Adjutant General of New York from 1869–1873, and another, Robert served in the U.S. Navy, both on the side of the Union. His sister Mary, on the other hand, married General William H.T. Walker of the Confederate Army. Frederick attended The Albany Academy and Bartlett Collegiate School at Poughkeepsie, New York and was graduated from Union College, which he entered at age 15, in 1844. He studied law under John V. L. Pruyn and was admitted to the bar in 1849 and practiced in Albany. That year gold was discovered in California. Townsend was equipped by his grandmother with equipment and an aide to seek his fortune on the Pacific coast. After being given up for dead following a long period of no news, Frederick returned to Albany with tales of being captured by Indians and surviving a tornado. He also carried a single nugget of the precious metal which he gave his grandmother who preserved it as a family treasure. Military career Returning home he was made captain of Company B of the Washington Continentals of Albany. He organized the 76th regiment of militia of which he was colonel, and later on the Albany Zouave cadets. He was appointed by Governor John Alsop King in 1857 Adjutant general of the state of New York, leading Townsend to end his law practice. Finding the militia to be less than it should be, he significantly reordered it. He prepared an annual report to the legislature from this department for the first time. Additionally he improved the conditions of the citizen soldiers and increased their numbers to 12,000 effective men. Townsend's efforts were recognized as effective and he was reappointed by the next governor of the state, Governor Edwin D. Morgan in 1859. In 1861 he organized the 3rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment of which he was commissioned colonel and which he led in the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10, 1861. Townsend's unit suffered 21 wounded from friendly fire when the 7th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment mistook them for Confederates and opened fire. He was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln major in the 18th U.S. Infantry on August 19, 1861 and served under Generals Don Carlos Buell and William Rosecrans. Townsend took part in the Battle of Lick Creek, Mississippi, where he led the battalion in reconnaissance. On April 30 he took part in the Siege of Corinth and in the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky on October 8, 1862, which has been called one of the bloodiest of the Civil War given the number of soldiers engaged.The Civil War Battlefield Guide p. 127 At the Battle of Stones River on December 31, 1862 with all the senior officers of the regular brigade having been shot except the brigade commander, Townsend was placed in command of the left wing of the brigade. The loss of his brigade in the fight was 94 killed 497 wounded and 50 missing. He was then brevetted lieutenant colonel, colonel, and brigadier general in the regular Army. In 1863 he was posted to duty as acting assistant provost marshal general at Albany. In 1867 after a leave of absence in Europe he was made acting assistant inspector general of the department of California from which he inspected all the government posts in Arizona. He resigned his commission in 1868 and returned to Albany. He was appointed brigadier general of 9th Brigade of the state militia in 1878 and adjutant general of the state in 1880 under Gov. Alonzo B. Cornell. As part of a commission to revise the military code in the state, Townsend undertook to restructure the state forces, resulting in a disbanding of a number of regiments, including his former command, the 9th Brigade, accompanied by a downsizing of the officer corps. Along with the painful downsizing and restructuring of the militia, he successfully urged the adoption of a state service uniform and a state military camp, which later came to be named Camp Townsend, (now Camp Smith) in Peekskill.

Course The Palix River rises in the Willapa Hills in Pacific County. It flows generally west to Willapa Bay, an estuary of the Pacific Ocean. The river has three fork tributaries, the North Fork, Middle Fork, and South Fork Palix River. The North Fork originates a couple miles west of South Bend, near the source of the Bone River. It flows generally south through hilly terrain, close to the Niawiakum River. In its final mile the North Fork turns west and enters the broad and marshy Palix River tidal estuary in which the Middle Fork and South Fork join. It is approximately long. The South Fork Palix River originates about a mile south of the Palix River estuary. It flows in a curving path southwest then north, less than a mile from the coast, to join the other forks in the Palix estuary. It is approximately long. The Middle Fork Palix River originates about a mile east of the Palix River estuary. It flows west, quickly entering the estuary.

It is the largest of the nine lagoons, or \\"salt ponds\\", in southern Rhode Island. It is utilized for recreational activities, as well as oyster and quahog harvesting. Found along its shores are \\"extensive\\" archaeological remains. Ninigret Pond, like others in the region, was \\"formed after the recession of the glaciers 12,000 years ago\\". The pond is situated on low-lying ground, and as such, it is considered particularly vulnerable to storm surge flooding. It is connected to Green Hill Pond via a small channel. The pond is located within the Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge. Both are named for Ninigret, a 17th-century sachem of the eastern Niantic aboriginal American tribe. Watershed and restoration According to information compiled by the Rhode Island Sea Grant program, Ninigret Pond's watershed covers , of which is occupied by water; Ninigret Pond itself has a surface area of , while other, smaller bodies of water account for the other . Averaging deep, Ninigret Pond has a salinity level of 24 parts per thousand. The pond receives: about 1,927,399,642 gallons of precipitation per year; 8,974,614–12,376,282 gallons of groundwater flow per day; and 1,881,774–4,849,186 of river and stream flow per day. It is permanently connected to the Block Island Sound by a constructed breachway. As a result of heavy development along the eastern shore, there are indications that water quality is degrading; however, restoration efforts are in place. Eelgrass population has also been significantly declining. Dredging and cleanup projects have additionally been established. In the past, breakwaters were established, allowing inflows of sand to \\"choke\\" the pond. The Coastal Resources Management Council and the Army Corps of Engineers spent in excess of $4.1 million to remove harmful sand accumulations. Despite this, Ninigret was assessed as being the cleanest of the nine salt ponds. In contrast, Winnapaug Pond contains high levels of pollution.

Linou's earliest evidence of habitation dates back to the Middle Ages. The name of the village, however, appears to have ancient Greek roots, suggesting life in the region since antiquity; on old maps it is marked as Linu. Linou – often shown on local maps as Linou-Flasou – is built on the right of the river valley Karkoti at an approximate altitude of 310 meters above sea level. The village receives an average annual rainfall of about 360 millimeters. In the village, some of the older residents own plots of farmland where they cultivate olives, citrus fruits, some vegetables (peas and tomatoes), wheat, legumes and a few types of fruit tree (apple, pear, plum and mespilies). There are also large areas of uncultivated land, occupied by wild natural vegetation, mostly pine, together with thyme, rosemary, and hawthorn. Linou has population fluctuations. In 1881 the standing population was 214, which increased to 226 in 1891. This later decreased to 184 in 1901, but a decade later, increased to 189, to 201 in 1921 and 252 in 1931. In 1946, occupants of Linou numbered 311 (272 Greek Cypriots and 39 Turkish Cypriots), which later increased to 338 in 1960 (320 Greek Cypriots and 18 Turkish Cypriots). After 1964, as a result of intercommunal riots that followed the rebellion of the Turkish Cypriots, the few Turkish Cypriot inhabitants of Linou left the village and moved to the adjacent mixed Turkish Cypriot villages.

They are related to the development of the railways in the Italian colonial empire. This history started with the opening in 1888 of a short section of line in Italian Eritrea, and ended in 1947 with the loss of Italian Libya after the Allied offensive in North Africa and the destruction of the railways around Italian Tripoli. The railways in the Italian colonial empire reached 1,561 km before World War II. History The construction of railways in the African Italian colonies (Eritrea, Libya and Somalia) did not have, for various reasons, a great development compared to that promoted by other European countries on the same continent.Astuto. \\"Questioni ferroviarie africane: il problema ferroviario\\", p.30 The first rail lines were built mainly for war needs in the absence of efficient means of communication in the occupied territories, after the conquests of Eritrea and Libya. However, were quite limited in the first decades of occupation. In 1940 the amount of railways in operation, between Italian East Africa and Libya, amounted to 1,556 km of which, however, the 693 km of the Italian section of the Railway Djibouti-Addis Abeba were pre- existing and built by the French Empire for Ethiopia. The railways were built by Italy from the outset with little potential, because built with narrow gauge rails and with light metal type, and were never of great economic importance because isolated from the lines of neighboring states. Indeed, the choice of a gauge 950 mm, different from the meter gauge usually used in Africa, contributed to this effect. Today most of these Italian colonial railways have disappeared: those of Somalia after the British occupation in 1941-1945. The Libyan ones were suppressed in the 1960s, but in the same decade the Eritrean railway between Asmara and Massawa was reactivated after long neglect of trafficking. Italian Libya railways history In Italian Libya the first railways were created by the Italians after their conquest of Tripoli in 1911. The first section was done in 1912 from the port of Tripoli to Ain Zara, with 11 km of rails using a track gauge of 950 mm. By the end of the same year were done another 39 km until Tagiura and Zanzur.Stefano Maggi.\\"Le ferrovie nell'Africa italiana\\", p.12 From May 1913 the Italian Ferrovie dello Stato started to manage the railways, with the \\"Royal Law #314\\". In 1915 the railways in Libya had an extension of 180 km, reaching from Tripoli the cities of Zanzur/Sorman and Bivio Gheran/Henschirelabiad. After World War I were completed all the works (with the railways Stations) in the 118 km of the Tripoli-Zuara. Derna - Bar and restaurant Cirenaica - Goods train (stamped on 29 December 1916) The construction of the lines in Cyrenaica began later: the first lines were in fact only small decauville trains on purely military track, in the Italian Benghazi and Cyrenaica area.Stefano Maggi: \\"Le ferrovie nell'Africa italiana\\", p.13 Another small decauville was built around the port of Derna. In the fall of 1914 19 km long section was opened between Benghazi and Benina and two years later the next section. Between 1926 and 1927 other sections were opened to Barce, completing the 108 km line from Benghazi. At the end of 1926 approximatelty 56 km of railway were added between Benghazi and Soluch. In the 1930s there were five small railway lines in Italian Libya, 3 in Tripolitania and 2 in Cyrenaica: Tripoli - Zuara; Tripoli - Vertice; Tripoli - Tagiura; Benghazi - Barce and Benghazi - Soluch. The Italian authorities -after the construction of these initial 400 km of railways in five lines around Tripoli and Benghazi- decided to give priority to the construction of roads in Libya, when Benito Mussolini took control of the Italian colonies. However Italian experts studied the possibility of building a \\"Transaharan railway\\" from Libya to the gulf of Guinea in cooperation with the French authorities: but it remained only a colonial dream.Stefano Maggi.\\"Le ferrovie nell'Africa italiana\\", p.22-23 After 1927 no more railways were made in Libya, but during World War II the need of railways transport to the front during the war in the frontier with British Egypt changed this approach. In 1940 was started the study of connecting the Tripoli-Zuara with the Tunisia border: in summer 1941 were nearly ready all the 60 km of this track line, that were not activated because was given priority to a new line from Tripoli toward Egypt (because of the needs for the war against the British empire). So, in spring 1941 the Italian government started the construction of a new railway (with a standard African track gauge of 1435 mm) between Tripoli and Tobruk. But by December 1942 all was stopped because of the Italian defeat in north Africa: of the 1040 km only 18 km were fully done in Tripolitania, while 40 km were partially ready in Cirenaica from Barce toward Derna.Stefano Maggi. \\"FERROVIE NELL AFRICA ITALIANA: ASPETTI ECONOMICI, SOCIALI E STRATEGICI\\" (in Italian) In summer 1942 was conquered by the Italians (with Rommel's Afrika Korps) the railways line built by the British and New ZealandersNew Zealand Engineers: The Western Desert Railway from Egypt until Tobruk, near the Egyptian-Libyan border. But a few months later the Marsa Matruk-Sollum-Tobruk line was back in Allies control.History of the Western Desert Railway Until the 1950s the railways remained active. But by the 1960s there were only two small railways in Libya, departing from Benghazi and using classical Littorine: Benghazi-Barce and Benghazi-Soluch. In 1965 the last remaining stations in Benghazi and Soluch were closed. Today no active railway exists in Libya. Notes Bibliography * Maggi, Stefano.

Known as Santi Vincenzo e AnastasioVincent and Anastasius, martyrs, are commemorated on January 22, according to the General Roman Calendar of 1954. since the 16th century, it was rebuilt in the Baroque style and completed in 1650. Two entablatures superimposed over the main one, all three with arched, angled or broken pediments, concentrate attention on the richly sculptural central bay of the façade's two storeys, in a theatrical composition \\"more curious than exemplary\\" that found few imitators.Multiple trabeation, columns and decorative sculpture \\"contribuiscono a conferire alla facciata, più curiosa che esemplare, un effetto scenografico non trascurabile\\"\\" (Touring Club Italiano, Roma e dintorni (Milan, 1965) p.263.

The church was reconstructed on the order of Cardinal Mazarin, whose triumphantly presented coat of arms and cardinal's hat, supported by angels, is the focus of the façade composition. It is rumored that Mazarin's niece, Marie Mancini, a mistress of Louis XIV of France, is also portrayed on the facade, in the central female mascaron. The sculptural portrayal of a laywoman and the support of the cardinal's ecclesiastical coat of arms by the sculptures of two barechested women make the church unique among churches in Rome. Until the 1820s, Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi was known as the \\"Pontifical Parish\\" (Parrocchia Pontificia). The church's interior features a single nave; the altar is decorated by the painting Martyrdom of Saints Vincent and Anastasius by Francesco Pascucci. Prolific Italian illustrator and engraver Bartolomeo Pinelli (1771–1835) was buried in Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi. Its travertine facade has proved porous; restoration with liquid hydraulic mortar and other materials was undertaken in 1989–90 to arrest deterioration.Bettina Elten, \\"Facciata della chiesa dei SS.

The village is located 10 km south of Klirou, 36 km from Nicosia. History Antique swords, fig. 1–3: Xiphos, fig. 4: Makhaira. Greek livestock bells The village name came into existence at around 800 AD after a general amnesty pardon of all dissidents and fugitive outlaws on the island. From the 5th to the 8th century there was a lot of turmoil in the islands history. Earthquakes, anti-Pagan laws and Arab invasions caused dissidents and refugee groups to form in Clans, in the inaccessible valleys and peaks of Troodos mountains, in order to avoid oppression. There they established the rule of the sword as basic tool of survival. Hence the name of the mountain Makhaira originates from these clans fighting ability. One of these clans was the Kourries, originated by dissident's fugitives from Kourion area. The Kourries were in control of the East side of the mountain. Gourri village name is taken from the Kourries’ clan. In Komnenos dynasty (1081–1185), the Gouri and other villages were given as a privilege to Machairas Monastery. The various clans were merged into the existing communities and the new monastery had invested \\"for the benefit of communities\\", in production of agricultural tools, \\"ploughs, saddles, and livestock bells.\\" During the Frankish period (1192–1489) the Knights Templar implemented the feudal system to the island and abolished the privileges of the monastery. The locals had rebelled and Franks, in order to suppress the rebellion, applied the (military feudalism) Commandry (feudalism) in the village and generally in Pitsilia. The uprising resulted in the execution of 13 monksorthodox church calendar: Feast Day – May 19 and the complete destruction of the villages Rogkia and Kalamithasa as other small settlements.

The series aired two season since April 16, 2009 on Rede Globo.  Plot  The plot centers around Lieutenant Wilson, from the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State (Polícia Militar do Estado do Rio de Janeiro), who works in the internal affairs department of the aforementioned police division. He and his teammates investigate crimes committed by the fellow members of the Military Police. Wilson answers to Colonel Caetano, an experienced and respected member of the Force, and dates Jaqueline, a nurse who regrets having a boyfriend that has no fixed time to be home. Wilson is also constantly confronted by the ghost of Jonas, a suicidal police officer who shot himself in the head in front of Wilson after being caught involved with crimes. Jonas acts like an alter-ego to Wilson, using sarcasm and realistic comments to disturb his former colleague. Wilsion's team include Sergeant Selma, the only woman on the team; Corporal Cazarre, who is always enthusiastic and is often making sexist comments to Selma; Corporal Oberdan, who believes that logical deductions are the best way to solve crimes and Sergeants Genival and Jorge, who work in the archives of the Civil Police providing useful information and data to the team. Out on the streets, Wilson is also helped by Samuca, a paralyzed camelô who lives in the underworld of favelas and provides his police friend the information that police officers (theoretically) shouldn't know.

It was actually a short version of the series' third season. = Plot = As the films begins, Wilson is seen sit and quiet in a room. A woman says \\"session's over\\" and it is revealed that he was visiting the police psychologist. The film then shows that he has been drinking heavily and distancing himself from his wife Jaqueline and son Bruno. In media res, it is revealed that Wilson previously arrested a police officer, Sergeant Guedes, who harassed and robbed people from a favela raided and occupied by the police. Afterwards, Wilson was promoted to captain, but in the night he was celebrating his promotion with Colonel Caetano and his colleagues, two gunmen in a car drove-by and killed his every friend, except for Caetano. Believing it was a retaliation for arresting Guedes, he succumbs to survivor guilt and that leads to his current state. Wilson is reminded by Samuca that his son's birthday is coming soon and decides to buy him a gift at a shopping center. Upon leaving, he tries to cut some corners using a car-exclusive ramp, and one vehicle tries to run him over. He manages to escape and believes someone tried to have him killed, but due to his recent drinking problems, people do not believe him, much to his disappointment. It is not until he suffers other attempts on his life that his colleagues are convinced that he is being targeted. Caetano assembles a new team for Wilson: Sergeant Lidiane (Naruna Costa); Lieutenant Demétrio (Eucir de Souza) and Forensic Léo (Sérgio Cavalcante). Léo analyses some capsules from a previous attempt on Wilson's life and discovers they were fired by a 70-year-old pistol from World War II, which leaves the cops even more puzzled. When the group is alerted that Guedes escaped from prison, they believe it is him who is trying to have Wilson terminated and try to track him. When caught, Guedes explains he escaped prison to be able to visit his dying mother one last time at the hospital, which is later proven to be true. While Wilson wonders who would be trying to kill him, he discovers his wife Jaqueline is missing. Because nobody called to demand a ransom, they are left clueless of her whereabouts and Demétrio even suggests she left Wilson for another man. After an extensive investigation, the cops discover that the car used to attempt on his life belonged to a mental care institution. There, they find out one of the patients escaped with the car. They then visit the patient's mother, who knows nothing. It is then explained that the kidnapper is Carlos Henrique (João Miguel), a man Jaqueline met in her first years as a nurse and who fell in love with her, though she rejected him. His father was a collector of Nazi Germany artifacts and killed himself by locking himself in a garage and turning the car engine on. He left some vintage guns for his son, which would later grow crazy due to the suicide and to Jaqueline's rejection. He arranged a seemingly innocent dinner with Jaqueline but managed to abduct her. He locked her in a hotel room with a vinyl disc looping the song \\"Come As You Are\\" and explained he will now keep her forever by his side. Another clue leads the cops to the hotel, but Carlos and Jaqueline were gone as the cops broke in. Another clue leads them to a mansion of his family in the outskirts of the city. There, Carlos attempts to kill himself and Jaqueline using the same method of suicide of his father. Wilson and his friends arrive in time and manage to rescue Jaqueline. Wilson knocks Carlos unconscious, but he wakes up and kills himself with a bullet.

Variations on the feudal aid were collected in England, France, Germany and Italy during the Middle Ages, although the exact circumstances varied. Origin The term originated in the late 11th century, and it first appears in northern France, in the County of Anjou.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 65 It was a payment made by the tenant or vassal to the lord on certain occasions, usually the knighting of the lord's eldest son and the marriage of his eldest daughter. Occasionally it was collected when the lord needed to pay a ransom after being captured.Coredon Dictionary of Medieval Terms & Phrases p. 8 Sometimes a fourth occasion was added to the customary list: when the lord went on Crusade.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 312 Other times when aids might be demanded were when the lord himself was being taxed by his own superiors. At those times, the lord might try to pass the demand on to his own vassals.Zacour Introduction to Medieval Institutions p. 98 The growth of the custom sprang from the traditional obligation of the vassal to render aid and counsel to his lord. At first, this was physical aid in the form of military service and attendance at the lord's court, but gradually it came to include financial aid to the lord as well. As it became obligatory to give monetary gifts to the lord, it also became limited by custom to set occasions.Bloch Feudal Society Volume 1 pp. 222-224 In France The first recorded royal feudal aid levied in France was that of 1137. This was assessed by King Louis VI in order to pay for the marriage of his heir, the future Louis VII, to Eleanor of Aquitaine. Another aid was levied in 1147 by Louis VII to pay for his crusade. The kings of France continued to collect aids for crusading under Philip II and Louis IX.Hallam and Everard Capetian France p. 224 Under Philip IV, the payment of aids was extended to under vassals as well as towns.Hallam and Everard Capetian France p. 378 In England The custom of collecting aids arose in northern France, and was brought to England following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. There, the three customary occasions for the collection of aid came to be the knighting of the eldest son, the marriage of the eldest daughter and when the lord needed to be ransomed. Custom also limited the amount that could be collected at each occasion.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 131-132 The English kings after the Conquest exploited their rights to aids extensively, although Henry I promised in his coronation charter to respect custom in the amounts and times he collected them. Records from the Pipe Rolls, however, show that Henry continued to exact more than custom allowed.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 161 Under Henry II, the royal government needed ever greater sums of money to operate, so it continued the practice of extorting the aids whenever possible for as much as possible.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 267 The 1168 aid for the marriage of Henry II's daughter was not only assessed on the nobles, but collected from the towns and from the royal lands also.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 365 In England, Magna Carta limited the occasions on which a lord might impose an aid. Chapter XII of Magna Carta dealt with aids, limiting the ones that the king could collect to the three customary ones unless the barons agreed to the imposition of non-customary ones. Chapter XV then regulated the aids that the barons themselves could impose on their vassals, and stipulated that the king could not grant a license allowing a baron to impose a non-customary aid on his vassals.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 317 Many examples of English Feudal Aids were published in Inquisitions and Assessments Relating to Feudal Aids, with Other Analogous Documents Preserved in the Public Record Office, A.D. 1284-1431, 6 vols. (1899–1920). These volumes are arranged by traditional counties and includes some examples that were not strictly aids In Germany and Italy Although gifts from vassals to lords happened in the German empire, they do not appear to have become compulsory nor have been institutionalized into formalized occasions when they were required. However, aids for the customary occasions were sometimes collected from German towns in the 12th and 13th centuries, as they are mentioned in town charters.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 471 In Italy, the custom of feudal aids appears to have been introduced by the Normans when they conquered Sicily and southern Italy.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 245 Evidence for feudal aids in the northern part of Italy is late, and the custom may have been introduced from France or Sicily.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 254 Similar payments Aids were distinct from the feudal incidents, which were collected when the vassal died. It was also distinct from the tallage, which was a tax imposed on the towns and the royal lands.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 382-383 Under Henry III, some voluntary taxes came to be called aids, but should not be confused with the feudal aids owed by vassals, which continued to be collected.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 385 Bishops sometimes imposed aids, for similar occasions such as making a pilgrimage to Rome or aid the construction of cathedrals and churches.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 145 Problems The historian Susan Reynolds notes that the evidence for feudal aids only dates from the 11th century, rendering the view that it arose earlier in a requirement of a vassal to give aid to his lord somewhat suspect.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 10 She also notes that although the classic view of the aid was that it was raised from holders of fiefs, in reality it was collected from peasants more often than from nobles. The earliest notations of feudal aids being collected do not imply a lord-vassal relationship, which makes some traditional aspects of their early history suspect.Reynolds Fiefs and Vassals p. 477 See also History of the English fiscal system Citations References   Category:Economic history of England Category:Feudal duties Category:Feudalism Category:Medieval economics Category:Medieval English law ","title":"Feudal aid"},{"id":"23195477","text":"Emam Reza (, also Romanized as Emām Reẕā) is a village in Jayezan Rural District, Jayezan District, Omidiyeh County, Khuzestan Province, Iran.

Located on the bank of the Taedong River, the pavilion was first constructed during the Goguryeo dynasty as \\"Sansu Pavilion\\", and was part of the defenses of the walled city of Pyongyang (along with the nearby Taedong Gate and Pyongyang Bell). It is labeled as National Treasure #16 in North Korea. History The pavilion first gained fame after Pyongyang was captured during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea in the 16th century; under the orders of General Kim Eung-seo, a kisaeng named Gye Wolhyang seduced and drugged the Japanese commander of Pyongyang, Konishi Hidanokami, in the pavilion. She then led General Kim to the sleeping commander, where he beheaded him; though Kim escaped, Kye was later executed for her role in the plot. Kim Ung So later returned to liberate Pyongyang in 1593 with the help of the Ming Chinese Army, and built a shrine to Wolhyang next to the pavilion (the district in Moranbong-guyok where she lived was also named after her). The pavilion was converted into a scenic overlook under the Koryo dynasty, and became a popular subject with poets and artists alike; A famous story relates how the Koryo-dynasty poet Kim Hwang Won broke his brush and wept after being unable find words to express the beauty of the view. The pavilion was later reconstructed under the Joseon dynasty and rechristened as \\"Ryongwang\\" pavilion because of its commanding views over the Taedong. In 1835, the small wooden shrine to Kye Wolhyang was replaced with a granite marker praising her patriotism. Though severely damaged during the U.S. bombings of Pyongyang during the Korean War, the pavilion was restored shortly after. Restoration work carried out in the 2010s was done in cooperation with the Prince Claus Fund, Paektu Cultural Exchange operator Michael Spavor, and the North's National Administration for the Protection of Cultural Heritage.

Early life and education As a child during World War II, Tarttelin was evacuated from Grimsby to Kirkstead, near Woodhall Spa, and attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Horncastle. He lived on a working farm which functioned with horse-drawn machinery, aspects of which have informed his work since. Returning to Grimsby at the end of the war he studied at Wintringham Grammar School, where he was taught by the artist Ernest Worrall who encouraged him to apply for University College London's Slade School of Fine Art. He was accepted for the school at the age of 17, and studied under Randolph Schwabe and Sir William Coldstream. Others teaching at the Slade during Tarttelin's time were Sir Thomas Monnington, P.R.A., and visiting tutors Sir Stanley Spencer, Victor Pasmore and Lucian Freud. While at the school he was awarded a prize for watercolour landscape by the critic and art historian Eric Newton. Tarttelin returned to Grimsby and, with the exception of Army Service, has lived and worked there since. Career Tarttelin has exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art from the age of 18, and has shown work with the Royal Society of British Artists, the Society of Equestrian Artists, and in exhibitions under the auspices of the Arts Council. He has been a gallery artist at Quinton Green Fine Arts, Cork Street, London, where he held a solo retrospective show. He held other solo shows between 1961 and 1988 and has participated in group exhibitions in the UK and abroad. While producing his own work, he taught at Grimsby School of Art where his pupils included actor John Hurt, and Nick Ellerby who has also exhibited at the Royal Academy. Much of Tarttelin's work has been privately commissioned, including portraits of John Hurt for the film 1984 and Sir Joseph Nickerson for the Royal Agricultural Society, for the Church and the Quorn Hunt, and for racehorses Brigadier Gerard, Grundy, The Minstrel and Arkle. His paintings are held in collections in the UK, US and New Zealand, Tarttelin's mural Apollo and the Muses hangs in Grimsby Public Library, and a retrospective exhibition of his work was held in Grimsby's Fishing Heritage Centre in 2009.

Hildesley or Hildesleigh; died 4 August 1539) was an English Dominican, prior provincial of his order, then an agent of Henry VIII and his church reformation, and Bishop of Rochester. Life According to Anthony Wood, Hilsey was a member of the Hildesley family of East Ilsley in Berkshire. He entered the Order of Preachers at Bristol, and then moved to the Dominican house at Oxford, where in May 1527, he graduated B.D., and proceeded D.D. in 1532; it is probable that he studied also at Cambridge. In May 1533 he was prior of the Dominican house at Bristol, and wrote a letter to Thomas Cromwell, whom he apparently regarded as his patron, and with whom he seems to have had earlier dealings. This was to explain and excuse his conduct in preaching against Hugh Latimer. He had come across Latimer as a preacher against pilgrimages and other religious traditions, but soon decided that Latimer was more concerned with attacking the abuse of the traditions, rather than the traditions themselves.Duffy, p. 380. In April 1534, Cromwell appointed him provincial of his order, and commissioner, along with George Browne, provincial of the Augustinians, to visit the friaries throughout England. The commissioners were to administer to the friars the oath of allegiance to Henry, Anne Boleyn and their issue, to obtain from them an acknowledgment of the King as head of the national church, and to make inventories of their property. The commissioners visited the London houses 17–20 April, went in May to the friaries within easy reach of London and then turned west. On 21 June, he reported to Cromwell from Exeter, and in July he reached Cardiff in pursuit of two Observantine friars who were trying to leave the kingdom. In 1535, on the death of John Fisher, Hilsey succeeded him as Bishop of Rochester, consecrated on 18 September by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer at Winchester. He begged Cromwell for his predecessor's mitre, staff and seal, as being himself too poor to procure such things. In January 1536, Hilsey preached at Catherine of Aragon's funeral, alleging that, in the hour of death, she had acknowledged that she had never been Queen of England. In March, he obtained a faculty from Cromwell enabling him to remain prior of the London Dominicans and, when they were dispersed, he received a pension. In 1536, he exercised the duties of censor of the press for the king. On 12 February 1538 he denounced the Rood of Grace of Boxley Abbey in Kent as a fraud, exhibiting its machinery and breaking it to pieces.Robert Hutchinson, Thomas Cromwell (2007), pp. 162–3. On 24 November 1538, he preached at St Paul's Cross on the blood of Hailes Abbey, Gloucestershire as a \\"feigned relic\\".Duffy, p. 412.http://www.britainexpress.com/counties/glouces/abbeys/hailes.htm He affirmed it to be clarified honey and saffron. In November 1538, as perpetual commendatory of the Dominicans in London, he surrendered the house into the king's hands. He died on 4 August 1539, and was buried in Rochester Cathedral. Works Hilsey was occupied, during his last years, in compiling, at Cromwell's order, a service-book in English. It appeared in after his death in 1539 as the Prymer.The Manuall of Prayers, or the Prymer in English, set out at length, whose contents the reader, by the Prologue next after the Kalender, shal sone perceave, and there in shal se brefly the order of the whole boke. Set forth by Jhon, late Bishop of Rochester, at the commandment of the ryght honorable Lorde Thomas Crumwel, Lorde Privie Seal, Vicegerent to the kynges highnes (printed by John Mayler for John Waylande). This has a dedication by Hilsey to Cromwell and an elaborate 'instruction of the sacrament', besides some shorter explanatory prologues. Less radical than the 1535 Prymer of William Marshall,Duffy, p. 444. it was also evangelical with anti-Catholic polemics incorporated and integrated in the text with devotional material,Duffy, p. 542. and ultimately was more influential; Hilsey's arrangement of the Epistles and Gospels is substantially the same as in the later prayer books. The book was republished in great part as The Prymer both in Englyshe and Latin in 1540; there was an edition in Edward Burton's Three Primers Put Forth in the Reign of Henry VIII (1834). Hilsey also prepared a juvenile version of his primer,The Primer in English, most necessary for the Educacyon of Children, abstracted out of the Manuall of Prayers, or Primer in Englishe and Latin, set forth by John, laet bysh. of Rochester, &c.;, 1539. and wrote De veri Corporis Esu in Sacramento which was dedicated to Cromwell and was mentioned in John White's Discosio-Martyrion (1553), on the Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist. Works also ascribed to Hilsey include Resolutions concerning the Sacraments and Resolutions of some Questions relating to Bishops, Priests, and Deaconns, but he apparently only assisted the compilation of these documents. He also helped to compile The Institution of a Christian Man.

The Maharashtra Police Department has a strength of nearly 1.95 lakh. It also has 15,000 women in its force. History During the 17th century (until 1655), the area of present-day Mumbai was under Portuguese control. The Portuguese formed a basic law enforcement structure in this area with the establishment of a Police outpost in 1661.Mumbai Police – History at the Mumbai Police Website The origins of the present day Mumbai police can be traced back to a militia organized by Gerald Aungier, the then Governor of Bombay in 1669. This Bhandari Militia was composed of around 500 men and was headquartered at Mahim, Sevree and Sion. In 1672, the judicial overview of police decisions by courts was introduced, although none of the judges had any actual legal training.Edwardes (1923), p 19 The situation remained unchanged through the Maratha wars.Mumbai Police Force History on TIFR website. However, by 1682, policing remained stagnant. There was only one ensign for the whole Bhandari militia, and there were only three sergeants and two corporals. In 1936, the Sind Province Police was split from the Bombay Province Police. In 1947, it was renamed to Bombay State Police, following India's independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the Bombay State Police was divided into Gujarat Police, Mysore Police (later renamed Karnataka Police) and Maharashtra Police.

However, the building was actually conceived to commemorate the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh in 1870. The Duke laid the Foundation stone during his visit.

This results in lower unit costs compared to other large airlines operating a mix of narrow- and widebody fleets and allows the airline to use the aircraft's cargo capacity to increase its revenues and total profits. Since Dubai International Airport does not have any night flying restrictions, Emirates achieves a higher utilisation of its aircraft than competitors. It also has lower staff costs than longer established rivals, because in Dubai there are no unions and there is an abundance of cheap labour from India and Pakistan. Accusations of unfair competition Emirates Airbus A330-200 (A6-EKS) landing at London Heathrow Airport The established network carriers in Europe, North America and Australasia, i.e. Air France–KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air Canada, Delta Airlines, American Airlines, Qantas and Air New Zealand, perceive Emirates' strategic decision to reposition itself as a global carrier as a major threat because it allows air travellers to bypass traditional airline hubs such as London–Heathrow, Paris–Charles-de-Gaulle, Frankfurt and Amsterdam Schiphol on their way between Europe/North America and Asia/Australia by changing flights at Dubai instead. Some of these carriers, notably Air France, Delta, and Qantas, have accused Emirates of receiving hidden state subsidies and of maintaining too cozy a relationship with Dubai's airport authority and its aviation authority, both of which are also wholly state-owned entities that share the same government owner with the airline. They also allege that Emirates is able to reduce its borrowing costs below market rates by taking advantage of its government shareholders' sovereign borrower status. They claim that this government support cross-subsidises the airline, masking its true financial performance.Emirates Accused of Unfair PracticesFinancial Times (Row erupts between Qantas and Emirates), UK Edition, London, 9 November 2005Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, pp. 5-7 =Fuel subsidies= Many airlines have accused Emirates of receiving fuel subsidies from the Government of Dubai. The airline has denied these accusations, stating that it purchases its fuel at the same price, as well as on the same terms and conditions, as every other commercial airline at all airports at which it operates. In FY 2007/08, fuel accounted for more than 30% of Emirates total expenditure, comparable with other international long-haul carriers such as British Airways, Lufthansa, Qantas or Singapore Airlines.Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, p. 7 =Airport user charges= Emirates has also defended itself against competitor accusations claiming it pays discounted airport user charges at its home base. The airline rejected these claims, stating that it paid the same user charges at Dubai as everyone else, which were similar to those prevailing at other comparable airports in the region, including Abu Dhabi, Doha, and Bahrain.Guardian.co.uk =Local taxes= Many airlines have accused Emirates of having an unfair advantage, since it does not have to pay local taxes. The airline rejects these claims as misleading by clarifying that in the absence of income or corporate taxes in the UAE all airlines operating to and from Dubai benefit from this tax-free environment. In this context, Emirates also stresses that it has paid the Government of Dubai dividends to the tune of US$776 million, in return for US$10 million in seed capital gifted to the airline at its inception in 1985.Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu =Sixth freedom traffic= Emirates robustly defends itself against recurring claims accusing it of stealing other airlines' transfer passengers. It points out that its detractors have carried international passenger traffic between different third country points on their networks via their hub airports for decades, and that Emirates is entitled to do the same. Emirates furthermore points out that this enables it to offer regional passengers based in or near important secondary cities such as Glasgow, Newcastle, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Nice, Venice, Brisbane or Perth convenient, worldwide one-stop connections via its global hub in Dubai.Meed.comTim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, pp. 4, 11 =Relationship between Emirates and the Government of Dubai= Emirates has countered rivals' frequent accusations that its ownership by the Government of Dubai amounted to a direct subsidy, representing an unfair competitive advantage not enjoyed by most other airlines, by stating that it was a fully fledged commercial enterprise run at arm's length from the Dubai government, despite being wholly owned by it. =Labour cost advantages= Some airlines have claimed that being based in Dubai gives Emirates an unfair labour cost advantage over other airlines. Emirates has countered this by stating that it faces the same costs to attract and retain staff recruited from around the world on expatriate terms and conditions as other airlines. The airline points out that the total cost of expatriate employee benefits amounts to more than US$400 million per annum.Emirates.com Canadian expansion Emirates Airbus A340-500 Emirates started flying to Canada on 29 October 2007, operating three weekly non-stop services on the Dubai–Toronto route.Reuters.com Emirates has experienced very high capacity factors on its Canadian services, averaging 90% since the start of operations between Toronto and Dubai.

However, the current bilateral agreement between the UAE and Canada restricts Emirates to only three flights per week between Dubai and Canada. In addition to operating daily between Dubai and Toronto to give business and leisure passengers greater flexibility, the airline would like to add other cities such as Calgary and Vancouver to its UAE–Canada schedule.Emirates.com The Canadian Government has stated it does not see the need for more services in response to these requests.Theglobeandmail.com The Canadian Government has claimed that Air Canada might be adversely affected by increased competition from Emirates and that this could undermine its viability.Theglobeandmail.comTim Clark, President, Emirates Airline: Speech to the European Aviation Club, 12 November 2009, p. 14 Emirates has refuted these claims, stating that there was no direct competitive overlap between it and Air Canada, since the latter (before 2015) did not operate services to the UAE or to any points in the Middle East, Africa or the Indian subcontinent, places where Emirates' flights are always busy. Emirates also stated that this would benefit Air Canada as many of Emirates' Canadian passengers were transferring to/from points on Air Canada's extensive North American network through its Toronto hub.Emirates.com German expansion A330-200 taking off at Düsseldorf Airport Emirates commenced flights to Germany in July 1987 with the launch of scheduled services on the Dubai–Frankfurt route.

Energy & Industrials: A test case for Germany pits consumer interests against EC airlinesBreaking travel news [!BTN - Emirates may be capped to protect Lufthansa, 27 July 2007 In March 2009, Lufthansa said that it saw a competitive imbalance between Emirates and itself in the Germany–Dubai air travel market, effectively accusing the UAE carrier of stealing its transfer passengers between North America, the Middle East, Africa, India and the Far East. It also alleged that there were material differences in handling fees at Dubai Airport and unequal opportunities for the two airlines in each other's home markets. The latter relates to Emirates' heavy reliance on so-called \\"sixth freedom\\" traffic rights that enable it to carry passengers, cargo and mail between Germany and third countries via its hub in Dubai to fill most of the space on its Germany–Dubai flights, as a result of there being insufficient origin and destination traffic.Airflights.toThenational.ae Emirates has countered Lufthansa's claims by pointing out that its proposed German expansion would result in a \\"win-win\\" situation for both sides that would actually grow the German economy through additional economic activity generated, as a result of stimulating the air transport market between the two countries.Emirates.com An order of Germany's Federal Office for Goods Transport to Emirates to desist from price leadership on routes leaving Germany for non–European-Union (EU) destinations and forcing it to raise relevant business class fares by up to 20% has been the focus of the latest disagreement between the UAE carrier on one hand and the German government and Lufthansa on the other. Despite the Federal Office for Goods Transport's insistence that it has not singled out Emirates unfairly by demanding similar remedial action of other airlines regarding fares charged on non-EU routes out of Germany, Andrew Parker, Emirates' Senior Vice-President, denied any knowledge of this being the case.

While achieving initial success against limited opposition, it was brought to a halt by Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) and North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) forces at the Battle of Hoengsong. Background When US X Corps commander General Edward Almond received a request from Eighth Army commander General Matthew Ridgway on 30 January for an X Corps - Republic of Korea Army (ROK) III Corps operation similar to Operation Thunderbolt, he was in the process of extending X Corps’ diversionary effort ordered earlier by Ridgway. Having achieved the Yoju-Wonju-Yongwol line against little opposition, Almond was planning a strong combat reconnaissance above this line. Searching that deep at Corps' center and right could apply pressure on the KPA V and II Corps concentrated above Hoengsong and Pyongchang. At the same time, the US 2nd Infantry Division, due to move north along the Corps' left boundary as far as Chip’yong-ni, east of Yangp’yong, could protect the right flank of US IX Corps as Operation Thunderbolt continued. As shown by the Battle of the Twin Tunnels, the PVA appeared determined to retain control of Chip’yong-ni. They had good reason as the town was so situated that the force occupying it could control movements over Route 2 to the west, over Route 24 to the northeast, over Routes 24 and 24A below town, and thus through the Yangp’yong-Ch'ungju segment of the Han River valley stretching to the southeast behind it. Eighth Army possession of Chip’yong-ni, furthermore, would pose a threat of envelopment to enemy forces opposing US I and IX Corps below the Han River. For these same reasons General Almond planned to seize Chip’yong-ni and incorporated this plan in his overall recommendations for an operation styled on Operation Thunderbolt. Also behind Almond's proposals were late January intelligence reports of a strong enemy force assembling around Hongcheon, at the intersection of Routes 24 and 29, northeast of Chip’yong-ni and north of Hoengsong. This force, apparently part of the KPA V Corps, could be preparing to advance southwest on Route 24 through Chip’yongni, then down the Han valley toward Yoju and Ch’ungju. Or the V Corps might again push forces south on Route 29 through Hoengsong toward Wonju. To spoil either move, Almond considered Hongcheon the proper main objective of an X Corps attack. To disrupt both the KPA V Corps and II Corps, he outlined a coordinated X Corps- ROK III Corps advance, Operation Roundup. The current Corps' combat reconnaissance limit, generally the Chip’yong-ni-Hoengsong-Pyongchang line, was to be the line of departure for the operation and was to be occupied in a preliminary advance by the 2nd Infantry Division on the left, the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (187th RCT) in the center, and the US 7th Infantry Division on the right. This advance would base US units far enough forward to support a thrust at Hongcheon, which Almond planned ROK forces would make. He proposed a flanking operation against Hongcheon by the ROK 5th and 8th Infantry Divisions accompanied by artillery and armor drawn from the US units on the line of departure. From behind the 2nd Division on the left, part of the ROK 8th Division was to advance north over Route 29 while the main body moved northwest to cut Route 24 roughly halfway between Chip’yong-ni and Hongchon, then turned northeast to hit Hongcheon itself. On the right, the ROK 5th Division was to advance north through the mountains east of Route 29 through part of the area occupied by the KPA II Corps, then swing west against Hongch’on. The 2nd Division was to appoint one light artillery battalion, a medium battery, an automatic weapons battery and a motorized infantry battalion to move with and directly support the ROK 8th Division. These units eventually constituted Support Force 21. The 7th Division was to furnish a similar Support Force 7 for the ROK 5th Division. In each instance the artillery commander of the US division was to coordinate all artillery fire within his own zone and within the zone of the ROK division he was supporting. Later, because control of the ROK advance was centralized at Corps' headquarters and did not involve either US division headquarters per se, a question-warranted or not-would arise over who should order the displacement of these support forces. Five armored teams, each comprising a company of infantry and a platoon of tanks, also were designated, two by the 2nd Division, two by the 7th Division and one by the 187th RCT. Only three were used. Teams A and B from the 2nd Division were attached to the ROK 8th Division at the outset of the advance; Team E from the 187th RCT later opened operations under the control of the Corps' armored officer. By 5 February, the date set for opening the Hongchon strike, General Almond expected ROK III Corps to have come up even with X Corps’ line of departure. On the 5th ROK III Corps should start forward through successive phase lines, coordinating each phase of movement with X Corps’ progress, to destroy KPA II Corps forces in zone and to protect X Corps’ right flank. General Ridgway approved Almond's plan on 1 February and made Almond responsible for coordinating the X Corps and ROK III Corps attacks. Ridgway cautioned him, however, that for the remainder of Operation Thunderbolt his continuing mission of protecting the IX Corps’ right flank would be X Corps’ overriding tactical consideration. The next day Ridgway ordered ROK I Corps to capture the east coast town of Gangneung in an advance coordinated with the progress of ROK III Corps. X Corps’ preliminary advance to the line of departure was largely but not fully effected by the target date. At the Corps' west flank, the 23rd Infantry Regiment moved north of the Twin Tunnels and occupied Chip’yong-ni, surprisingly against no more than token opposition. At Corps' center, the 38th Infantry Regiment, now commanded by Col. John G. Coughlin, occupied Hoengsong, and the 187th RCT the ground immediately southeast. The 7th Division at the Corps' right was not yet on the line. Its 17th and 31st Infantry Regiments were still approaching over the Chech’on-Pyongchang and Yongwol-Pyongchang roads. Behind the line traced by these clumps of Americans, the ROK 5th and 8th Divisions were in final assemblies for the Hongcheon attack, one on either side of Route 29. The assault divisions of ROK III Corps, the ROK 7th and 9th, also were somewhat short of the line of departure on the 5th, yet near enough to satisfy General Almond. The day before, at a Corps' commanders’ conference at Suwon, he notified General Ridgway that he was ready to begin Operation Roundup. Ridgway that day ordered a westward shift of the X Corps-ROK III Corps boundary to give the ROK more of the territory north of Pyongchang. Hence, when Roundup opened at 08:00 on the 5th, General Yu's two divisions faced the bulk of the KPA II Corps while General Almond's two assault units confronted the KPA V Corps in the Hoengsong-Hongch’on area. Advance Although the advance started in the Thunderbolt pattern, the harsh mountains ahead of X Corps and ROK III Corps inhibited a complete ground search such as I and IX Corps were making. In X Corps' zone, the ROK 5th and 8th Divisions advanced in multiple columns astride the best roads, tracks, or trails permitting passage through the convoluted ground. The ROK troops climbed the higher ridges only when necessary to reduce an enemy position. The main routes for the ROK 8th Division were Route 29 and a mountain road-actually a poor stretch of Route 2-reaching west from Route 29 at a point above Hoengsong. The ROK 5th Division's principal paths followed the upstream traces of two small rivers east of Route 29. Physical contact between columns was rare, especially in the ROK 8th Division zone where the columns diverged as they proceeded north and northwest. After three days Almond perceived that the attack on Hongcheon was as much a battle against terrain as against enemy opposition. Resistance did stiffen after an easy opening day, but the defending forces stayed to the tops of hills and allowed the ROK to bring down heavy artillery concentrations and to maneuver around them. The ROK assault forces, in Almond's estimation, had gained confidence over the three days, substantially from the presence and support of the US artillery and tanks. As of 8 February the success of the advance thus appeared largely to depend on overcoming terrain limitations on infantry maneuver, tank movement, and artillery forward displacement. Against the combination of enemy hilltop defenses and difficult terrain, the two ROK divisions by 8 February had moved northwest, north, and northeast of Hoengsong. Almond decided on the 8th that the ROK 8th Division's main effort to envelop Hongcheon from the west could be eased by committing another division. Currently, one of the 8th Division's regiments was moving north astride Route 29 while the other two were pushing through rough ridges to the northwest to cut Route 24. If Almond set another force in the center to move up Route 29, the ROK 8th Division could make its enveloping move in full strength. Almond mistrusted his own reserve division, the ROK 2nd Infantry Division, still weak from losses in the PVA New Year's Offensive. He chose not to reduce the strength of the US 2nd or 7th Division defenses along the line of departure, and he could not use the 187th RCT, because on 4 February General Ridgway had notified him that they were scheduled to be taken off the line and that he was not to give them an offensive role. On the 8th Almond asked Ridgway for the ROK 3rd Infantry Division, then in ROK III Corps' reserve. Ridgway hesitated to take General Yu Jae-hung’s only reserve. On the other hand, Yu's assault divisions were reporting good progress through light to moderate resistance. Moving astride Route 60 from Pyongchang toward Ch’angdong-ni, to the north, the ROK 7th Division had advanced one regiment within of the latter town. On the Corps' right, the ROK 9th had moved above Chong-son through the upper Han valley for almost . Since Yu could get help from the US 7th Division, whose 31st Regiment was now following the ROK 7th Division above Pyongchang, Ridgway agreed to the transfer of the ROK 3rd Division for the duration of the operation and Almond instructed the division to be in position for an advance above Hoengsong on the morning of the 11th. While Almond was arranging to assist the ROK 8th Division's northwestward swing, a greater problem arose east of Route 29. On 7 February the ROK 5th Division, then advancing with two regiments forward, had encountered a KPA force estimated at four thousand. The division commander planned to eliminate the KPA on the 8th by bringing up his reserve regiment on the left for an attack to the east concurrent with attacks to the north and west by the center and right regiments. But his plan was spoiled when the right regiment, the ROK 27th, was hit on the 8th by hard KPA attacks from the northwest and northeast. One battalion was scattered, and the remainder of the regiment was forced to withdraw. The regiment continued to receive attacks until the early morning hours of the 9th when the KPA pulled away to the northwest. The alarming note was that some or all of these forces had come out of the ROK III Corps' zone. The KPA II Corps apparently was shifting forces westward to join V Corps in opposing X Corps. General Almond was obliged to prevent further incursion on his right if the envelopment of Hongcheon was to succeed. On the 10th he directed the ROK 5th Division to advance and establish blocking positions facing northeast near the Corps' boundary generally on the ground held by the ROK 27th Regiment when it was attacked, some northeast of Hoengsong. Along with this move, he ordered the US 7th Division to send a battalion northwest out of the area above Pyongchang toward a ground objective due east of Hoengsong. This advance, he intended, would drive KPA forces located near the Corps' boundary into the path of the ROK 5th Division's attack. Almond also ordered a battalion of the 187th RCT to move into position east of Hoengsong to deepen the east flank blocking effort at the right rear of the ROK 5th Division. The ROK 3rd Division, assembling just east of Hoengsong, was now to become the right arm of the maneuver against Hongcheon. Behind the protection of the ROK 5th Division to the east, the ROK 3rd Division was to move north in two columns through the heights east of Route 29 to a point due east of Hongcheon. There the right column was to face east in blocking positions while the left column turned west toward the town. Both moves, the ROK 5th Division's blocking effort at the right and the ROK 3rd Division's attack to the north, were to begin at noon on the 1lth. Support Force 7 was now to support the ROK 3rd Division. General Almond directed the 187th RCT to place its 674th Field Artillery Battalion in direct support of the ROK 5th Division and ordered the 96th Field Artillery Battalion, a Corps' unit previously assigned to reinforce the fires of Support Force 7, to switch its reinforcement to the 674th. Meanwhile, amid the adjustments in the X Corps' zone between 8 and 11 February, ROK III Corps continued to gain ground. The ROK 7th Division fought through Ch’angdong-ni and by evening of the 11th was echeloned left in regimental positions oriented north and northwest from above Ch’angdong-ni to below the town. On the Corps' right, the ROK 9th Division pushed up the Han valley, making contact with the ROK I Corps’ Capital Division in the high peaks rising east of the Han. Resistance was light on the 8th and 9th, but stiffened over the next two days when General Yu's forces ran into parts of the KPA 31st Division. Obviously, not all of the KPA II Corps had shifted west into the X Corps zone. ROK I Corps, moving up the east coast under General Ridgway's 2 February order to seize Gangneung, more than achieved its objective. With naval gunfire support from Task Force 95 in the Sea of Japan and against fainthearted opposition by the 69th Brigade, a unit of the KPA III Corps that disappeared altogether on the 8th, the Capital Division advanced in consistently long and rapid strides. In the Taebaek Mountains rising west of the coastal road, one regiment by evening of the 11th held positions above Route 20, which meandered west and southwest out of Gangneung to Wonju. The remainder of the division moving over the coastal road occupied Gangneung, then Chumunjin further north, and at nightfall on the 11th had forces in position above the latter town. Gains in the X Corps' zone remained much shorter. East of Route 29, the ROK 3rd Division by dark on 11 February advanced through light opposition to positions above Hoengsong. Next east, the ROK 5th Division reoriented and moved through moderate resistance within of its east flank blocking positions. The 1st Battalion, 187th RCT, meanwhile went into the position designed to place it at the right rear of the ROK 5th Division; from the Pyongchang area the 2nd Battalion, 31st Infantry, easily seized its terrain objective to the northwest in the effort to drive KPA forces into the ROK 5th Division's path. The ROK, however, were still some distance from their objectives. On and west of Route 29, the ROK 8th Division found lighter resistance, KPA forces tending to withdraw before actually obliged to do so. By nightfall on the 11th the 21st Regiment stood astride Route 29 north of Hoengsong. To the west, the 10th and then the 16th Regiments held positions northwest of Hoengsong along the crest of the mountains between Hoengsong and Route 24. A gap separated the 21st and 10th Regiments, and about of open space stood between the 10th and 16th Regiments. behind the 21st Regiment, the tanks and infantry of Support Team B, which had been attached to the ROK regiment, were assembled along Route 29. Another down the road, the infantry and artillery of Support Force 21 occupied positions near the town of Ch’angbong-ni. Below Support Force 21, the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, on General Almond's order had moved up from Hoengsong into a blocking position at the junction of Route 29 and the mountain road leading west. Support Team A, whose tanks and infantry were attached to the 16th Regiment, was further out on the mountain road. Still further out, between Support Team A and the front of the 16th Regiment, which lay across the mountain road, were the ROK 20th and 50th Field Artillery Battalions and the command posts of both the 10th and 16th Regiments. The nearest of the 2nd Division defenses around Chip’yong-ni now stood southwest of the 16th Regiment. After securing Chip’yong-ni before the opening of the operation, the 23rd Infantry Regiment had established a perimeter around the town, and Colonel Paul L. Freeman Jr. had run patrols east, west, and north. The patrol encounters with enemy forces were mostly minor, but by 9 February one particularly strong position was discovered on Hill 444 some east of Chip’yong-ni. On the 9th Freeman sent a battalion east and the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, came north from the Yoju area to reduce the enemy strongpoint. The latter battalion occupied the height on the 11th and thus held the 2nd Division position closest to the ROK 8th Division. Aftermath Given continued reports of eastward PVA shifts and taking them as clear signs of an imminent PVA offensive in the west-central region, General Ridgway late on 11 February instructed General Almond to patrol but not to attempt further advances toward Route 24 in either the US 2nd Infantry Division or ROK 8th Infantry Division zones until US IX Corps had reduced the PVA's Han River bridgehead below Yangp’yong. To move forward while IX Corps was still held up could isolate and overextend Almond's leftmost units in the area where the PVA 39th, 40th, 42nd and 66th Armies were obviously massing. As predicted by Eighth Army intelligence, on the night of 11 February the PVA XIII Army Group opened an attack towards Hoengsong. In shifting forces eastward they had moved the 66th Army from Kapyong to Hongcheon, whence one division struck south along Route 29. From start points near Route 24 between Hongcheon and Chip'yong-ni, a division of the 40th Army and one of the 39th Army joined the push on Hoengsong by attacking southeast. In the path of these initial attacks lay the ROK 8th Infantry Division.

Elliott steps away from the past to carve out an irreverent, slap-happy style that showed that folk music, when handled without studious care, could be a helluva lot of fun...

The game's name was inspired by the Dreadnought - a battleship used by the Royal Navy. The game had several features that were unique at the time of its publication. Every battleship and battlecruiser ever built for any country was available for use in gameplay. Unlike game boards commonly used at the time, the playing area had no fixed outer boundaries. Instead, the game was made up of four large blue sheets marked with hex grids. The sheets were placed side by side, and if a player sailed towards the edge, any unoccupied sheet could be picked up and moved to create a continuous playing surface. The game also includes rules for making smoke screens and for maneuvering around torpedo attacks in order to minimize the number of torpedo hits. Several scenarios were provided with the game, including the Battle of the Falkland Islands and the Battle of Jutland. Any combination of ships could be used to fight any real or fictional surface ship engagement from 1914 to 1945.

Three of the victims were teenagers, two of them with republican paramilitary links; one was a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army's youth wing and the other was a member of the Official Irish Republican Army’s youth wing. The incident took place during The Troubles. Background Civil sectarian conflict, caused by ethno-nationalist divisions, civil rights grievances, and revolutionary Marxist politics, augmented with escalating violence between paramilitary factions and the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British Army, had been ongoing in Northern Ireland since 1969, with several hundred people having been killed or injured. The area of West Belfast was particularly stricken with violent confrontations between elements of the Irish nationalist community and the police and military forces of the British State. West Belfast was increasingly a problem area for the police and the army given the open hostility of the population towards their presence, and activity from Irish Republican paramilitary forces in the neighbourhood, with the Provisional Irish Republican Army becoming increasingly aggressive in its attacks at the time that the Springhill shooting incident occurred. Shooting incident at Springhill =Provisional IRA version= According to a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) statement, on 10 July 1972, British Army snipers from the Parachute Regiment took up a position in Corry's timber yard at Springhill, West Belfast, and were seen to be reinforcing it with sandbags. Two cars subsequently drove into the vicinity, and the British Army detachment were observed to open fire upon them, firing two shots at the vehicles. One of the cars drove away at speed, whilst the other one drove a short distance and then stopped, the occupants getting out. On the occupants exiting the vehicle, the British Army post opened fire upon them. One of the stopped car's occupants was hit by a bullet in the head and fell seriously wounded. A local resident, Brian Petticrew, seeing the nearby incident, ran over to help the wounded man, but was also fired upon, and hit in the arm. Then this man's brother and a friend ran to the downed occupant but both were also wounded by gunfire in the process. At some point during the incident, a 13-year-old girl, Margaret Gargan, was fatally shot. A parish priest, Father Noel Fitzpatrick, and Patrick Butler, a passer-by, both ran to her assistance. Fitzpatrick was reportedly seen to be waving a white cloth above his head to display himself as a non-combatant, but they were also fired upon and killed. All of the victims were unarmed. =British Army statement= The British Army disputed the PIRA statement of the events, claiming that its troops were fired upon first by Provisional Irish Republican Army gunmen, ending a temporary ceasefire in the West Belfast area at that time. A British Army spokesman stated that: \\"There had been a heavy exchange of fire between the IRA and troops, some of the dead and wounded were undoubtedly caught in a crossfire.\\" The next day, 10 July 1972, the British Army stated that terrorists at the scene had been engaged and killed in the cross-fire with its detachment. Two of the five dead at the scene, who were occupants of the stopped vehicle, John Dougal (16), and David McCafferty (15), were reported to be members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army's Youth Wing, Fianna Éireann. The dead commemorated in a republican garden of Remembrance in Ballymurphy, Belfast Aftermath An \\"open\\" verdict was recorded at an inquest into the event, which has since sometimes been called \\"the forgotten massacre\\", because it has been overshadowed by the Bloody Sunday mass shooting in Derry just a few months earlier, in which British soldiers shot 26 unarmed Catholic civilians, only half of whom survived; and the even closer-by Ballymurphy massacre the prior year, in which members of the same battalion killed 11 civilians over three days. During the several decades since the Springhill incident, there has been intermittent pressure-group campaigning by relatives of the casualties, seeking a new legal inquiry into the event. Short film produced by Springhill residents. In 2014, the Attorney General for Northern Ireland, John Larkin QC, announced that new inquests have been scheduled into the deaths that occurred in the Springhill incident. There are two memorials for the slain, both in Ballymurphy, Belfast: Springhill Massacre Memorial Garden (dedicated on 4 May 1999), and Ballymurphy (completed 27 November 2005 and a memorial also to other area residents killed by the British Army and Loyalist paramilitary groups).

Striker's Den covers 70,000 sq. ft. within the Silver Creek Sportsplex, and consists of two large indoor soccer fields (180'x85'), two small arenas (80' x 50'), and over 9000 sq. ft. of matted area that is used for martial arts and as the home of a secondary business, LOL Parties.  History  Sriker's Den was founded by David Silva in March 2007.http://www.strikersden.com Silva first started working on the project with David Maley, founder of Rollin' Ice, a roller hockey venue Maley founded after retiring from the NHL, during the development stage of Silver Creek Sportsplex in 2004. In early 2006 Maley decided to go with a different candidate, Andrew Rolli, to lead the soccer portion of the business. After years of planning and working with the city to get the land rezoned and approved for construction the Silver Creek Sportsplex was built with Rollin' Ice on the north end of the business covering 80,000 sq. ft., and Club One Fitness on the south end of the building covering another 150,000 sq. ft. In the middle part of the property the area meant for 1 large and 2 small soccer fields was left empty as negotiations between Rolli, Rolli's partner Off The Wall Soccer, and Maley stalled. In March 2007 Maley asked Silva if he was interested in returning to the project. Silva had spent the previous year setting up MVP Arena, a smaller facility in North San Jose, which had grown successfully, but was limited in its ability to serve the community. Silva talked tried to broker a deal between MVP Arena and Silver Creek Sportsplex to manage the business, but when his partners at MVP Arena did not express interest he left and joined Maley to create Striker's Den in March 2007. By April 2007 the first leagues were started with men's, co-ed, and over-35 leagues. A Wednesday men's league was started in May, followed by a Sunday women's league in June. In June 2007 the two smaller fields were torn down to make way for a second large field, and by September the new large field was finished and all leagues were expanded. In late October the small fields were added back in a new area which was designated primarily for youth training and league play, and a new business unit, LOL Parties, which was created by Silva and his wife Monica, was started.  Activities  The primary activity at Striker's Den is indoor soccer league play. Most of the leagues are adult and play at night. In the winter youth leagues are formed primarily for competitive players, along with a recreational training program. A lacrosse league was started in the summer of 2008 and continues to this day. An indoor flag football league lasted one season during the spring of 2008, but did not continue.  Regular Schedule  Sunday evening - Women's league Monday evening - Co-ed league Tuesday evening - Men's 35+ league Wednesday evening - Men's league/Women's league Thursday evening - Men's league Friday evening - Co-ed recreational league On Saturdays and Sundays during the winter there are youth leagues. From spring to fall, the fields are also used for parties and special events run through LOL Parties.

It is suited for people who want to quickly start a website and reduce to a minimum the need to refer to technical system administrators for its update and maintenance. Also, it is suited for creating networks of portals due to the integrated search across multiple sites, skinnable layout and support for creating self-installable toolkits. It is released under the Mozilla Public License (MozPL or MPL) and it is designed in a modular and extensible way. It was initially developed by the European Environment Agency and several modules were added to suit the needs of other European institutions.  Source code  Naaya source code and relevant documentation are maintained at the Eionet Subversion repository using Trac as issue tracker for new features, bugs and enhancements. Buildout scripts for the installation of Naaya are available on the corresponding repositories, along with some extension packages. Several custom Naaya distributions have been developed for various networks of portals with specific installation procedures, documented separately.  Developers  Naaya was developed and it is being maintained by the European Environment Agency (EEA) through its IT consultants. The EEA also uses Naaya as the foundation for the EnviroWindows sites hosted on the EEA server as well as the Clearing House Mechanism for its Biodiversity toolkit.

A village in the district of Nicosia. Built on the banks of the river Elia, 300 metres above sea level and about 9 kilometres south of Astromeritis. In older times, water mills were constructed perpendicularly to the valley of Elia, so as to serve the needs of the village as well as those of several other neighbouring communities. The village's territory sits upon pebbles, sand and clay in the north and lava in the south. Some believe that the village owes its name to the shingles carried by the river and deposited on its banks, this being one of the village's impressive elements. The traditional houses of the village with their idiosyncratic architecture have these shingles as their base, offered to them by the river of Elia, while the rest part of the structure is made with mud-bricks. The sloping, tiled roofs complete the beautiful picture of the architecture of the village's houses. The inhabitants call these pebbles \\"vyzatzia\\" (plural, referring to a breast- like figure), these being stones that were shaped so by the river. These \\"vyzatzia\\" are a characteristic observed in tens of other villages in the region. Vyzakia's landscape is also characterised by an inclination toward the valley of Morfou. The village receives an average annual rainfall of around 350 millimetres and a large variety of produce is cultivated in its region. These crops are cereals (mainly barley), legumes, a few fruit-trees, almonds, and olives. Thyme, daffodils, prickly bushes, pines, cistuses, and many other prickly plants grow in the uncultivated slopes and the precipitous areas of the village, whereas reeds, oleanders, and eucalypti grow by the riverbed. The population has well increased. From 124 in 1881, the inhabitants increased to 440 in the census performed in 1982. In the last census of 2001 the community's inhabitants were 384. Vyzakia is a village with a history and tradition. According to Mas Latri, it was a feud during the Lusignan - Venetian era. According to researchers, Vyzakia was granted to Nicolas Morabit by King Jacob the \\"Nothos\\" (illegitimate). This village however, where the nut-brown colour of lava in the summer and the deep green of the various kinds of plantations in the winter prevail, is more known for its mediaeval church of Archangel Michael.

It has an area of 24.68 km2. It is located at . The Decree of June 8, 1899 ordained that Tenango's municipal head-board create the municipality of Río Blanco designating it as Tenango de Río Blanco. In the same year French financiers initiated the construction of the largest textile factory in Latin America, which was inaugurated on October 9, 1892 by President Porfirio Díaz. One thousand seven hundred workers came to be employed at Rio Blanco, including only 60 women. See The Years with Laura Diaz by Carlos Fuentes for an account of the role of the Red Brigades at Rio Blanco as a key event in the Mexican Revolution. Geographic Limits The municipality of Río Blanco is delimited to the north by Ixhuatlancillo and Orizaba to the south-east by Rafael Delgado and to the west by Nogales. The village of Tenango is very ancient and on the Independence having commemorated it constituted a municipality. On order of June 5, 1826 one declared that Huiloapan, Tenango and Nogales, they will have to form an alone municipality, but on November 4 24, 1859, the Minister of Government, it informed to the political chief that for instructions of the President of the Republic, the mentioned municipalities will have to remain again divided. Agriculture It produces principally maize, coffee, sugarcane and watermelon. Celebrations In Río Blanco , in June takes place the celebration in honor to San Pedro y San Pablo, Patrons of the town, and in December takes place the celebration in honor to Virgen de Guadalupe. Weather The weather in Río Blanco is very cold and wet all year with rains in summer and autumn. Relevant History Río Blanco’s company store was leased to Victor Garcín, a Barcelonnette who had been in the region for some decades since 1897. He was already an important landowner in the Orizaba valley, since in that year CIVSA bought land from him to build a water channel. Eduardo Garcín, his brother, was CIDOSA’s manager in 1903 and a member of the CIDOSA board in the General Assembly minutes of 1905 and 1906. The massacre of January 7 and 8 1907, known in Mexican history as the Río Blanco strike, put company stores in the Orizaba valley on the national front stage as one of the main causes of workers discontent. Stores were the main target of workers’ attacks. This event was crucial in shaping the bad reputation of company stores during the Porfiriato. Thereafter, they became a symbol of both the injustices that prevailed during the period and workers’ opposition to it, a preamble to the Mexican Revolution.

In 1890 the cemetery was sold to Krueger's son-in-law, Adolph Foelsch; the Foelsch family owned and operated the cemetery, including manufacturing concrete tombstones, until 1981. Those buried at Greenwood include former slaves, war veterans, members of fraternal organizations, artists, laborers and middle class African-Americans, as well as a number of famous and prominent African-Americans from St. Louis, including Dred Scott's wife Harriet Robinson Scott, folk hero Lee Shelton (“Stagger” Lee), musician Walter Davis and civil rights leader Charlton Tandy. Many of the people buried at Greenwood were originally from southern states and had participated in the Great Migration north. Funerals were numerous in Greenwood in the mid- twentieth century, but with desegregation, the cemetery saw a decline in use. In the 1980s it began to go derelict.

The area is situated east of the town centre. The area is home to Wetherby High School. History and development The Hallfield area was for many years before residential development largely in the grounds of the Hallfield Mansions, a large house which lay derelict for many years until it was replaced in the 2000s by a medical centre. The area was from the 1930s to the 1950s home to the landship, HMS Ceres. Until the post-war years, however, the area remained largely undeveloped. Post war demand for social housing lead to the building of the early parts of the Hallfields Estate in the 1950s. The early parts of the estate centres on First, Second, Third and Fourth Avenue. In the 1960s further council housing was built around Ceres Road, which is separated from the earlier parts by a cemetery. To the North of the estate further houses were built in the 1960s by the Home Office for use by staff at the nearby Wetherby Young Offenders Institution. Hallfield today Third Avenue in 2009 Today the estate has fallen into relative disrepair and as a rule, house prices are the cheapest in Wetherby, cheaper than other council estates, such as those around the Ainsty area of the town. Around half of the housing stock on the estates are now privately owned. In 2009 community notice boards were placed around the estate, these provide publicity to local issues and events. Recent problems with anti-social behaviour, particularly around the playing fields, local shops and the Freemans Way underpass have led to Leeds City Council and West Yorkshire Police engaging in a programme of community consultation and increasing police foot-patrols. In June 2013 the Mason Fields playground was closed by councillors due to public health concerns after the site had been occupied by travellers. Parts of the amenity, as well as the adjacent cemetery, had been used as toilet facilities and the play equipment had been damaged. Amenities Hallfield is situated close to Wetherby town centre, and backs onto the Horsefair Shopping Centre, providing easy access to local amenities. The area itself has a newsagent/ off-licence, a community centre, surgery, cemetery, playing fields, junior school, as well as being the location of Wetherby High School. There are bus routes operated by First Leeds which run through the estate linking it with Wetherby bus station, City Square, Leeds as well as Ainsty, Deighton Bar, Collingham, Seacroft, Oakwood and Harehills. Housing styles The majority of the housing on the estate is council housing, low rise and mostly 2-3 bedroomed semi-detatched and terraced houses. The estate is notable for having many unusual chalet-style terraced houses. The majority of the houses were constructed in the 1950s, however there are some 1970s houses on Burrel Close, the Chase, Freemans Way and Saddlers Walk as well as some 2010s houses built on Hallfield Lane on the site of the former veterinary surgery.

He was educated privately and at Tollington School. He first worked in a shipping office but became connected with the theatre as private secretary to George Dance, the playwright, manager and theatrical philanthropist. He tried his hand as a playwright, with limited success: The Times was dismissive of his short play, The Punctual Sex, in 1919.The Times, \\"A Hurricane Sketch.

The Times said of his career, \\"it was as press representative at the Palladium in 1925 that he began to develop his special talent for passing on to others ... his love and knowledge of the theatre generally and in particular of Drury Lane, of the Haymarket (Theatre of Perfection) and of the Gaiety (Theatre of Enchantment).\\" MacQueen-Pope was in charge of publicity at Drury Lane for 21 years, including four years running publicity for the whole of ENSA, which had its headquarters in the building. After World War II he produced books about all the theatres with which he had been principally associated, and many other books, including a biography of Ivor Novello, of whom MacQueen-Pope approved as possessing glamour, the quality he most prized in the theatre and which he felt was in short supply in the post-war world. In 1955 he began to give talks about the theatre on BBC television, using his nickname, \\"Popie\\" as a title for his series.

Since 1968, it belongs to the Municipality of Nicosia. Its population in 2011 was 11,564. Etymology Kaimakli derives from the Turkish kaymak whose basic meaning is cream, especially clotted cream, and, by extension, the best of something. The term also applies to the froth on top of a cup of Turkish coffee. Rupert Gunnis states that the suburb took its name from a farm that produced clotted cream.Gunnis, R. (1936) 'Historic Cyprus: A Guide to its Towns and Villages, Monasteries and Castles' (Nicosia, K Rustem & Bro), p.241 Facsimile of original republished 2014.) History Kaimakli has two churches, Saint Barbara's and Archangel Michael's, which was also a cemetery. In St. Barbara there are some interesting old icons, e.g. one of Virgin Mary dated back to 1763.Gunnis, R. (1936) 'Historic Cyprus: A Guide to its Towns & Villages Monasteries & Castles' (Nicosia, K Rustem & Bro), p.241 In the 19th and 20th Century the inhabitants of Kaimakli where famed for their building and labouring skills. In 1878 when the British arrived, they found that the Venetians had diverted the river Pediaios north of the city, but the old riverbed still ran through the centre, creating an open sewer and rubbish dump, which sometimes flooded into the surrounding streets. In 1881 the riverbed was covered, the municipality offered ownership of the area covered to labourers prepared to undertake the work. Much of it was done by builders from Kaimakli who thus built Hermes Street. Many of the shops built were then given to builders as a reward for their labour. The Cyprus Government Railway (Section 1) was constructed in 1905 and the line passed through Kaimakli towards Nicosia . A Station Halt and siding was then built in 1909 at the corner of what is now Synergasias Street. This formed part of the old line and the rail tracks are now buried within the tarmac and St Hilarion. The Line and station closed on 31 December 1951.The Story of the Cyprus Government Railway B S Turner The Station was restored in 1995 and a Linear Park was constructed on over a kilometre of the old track.

Gonur is among the largest ruins in the Murghab river delta region; over 150 ancient settlements have been found here. Soma drink He also found what appears to be the boiler for the ritual drink soma, which is mentioned in the Rigveda and also in the Avesta as haoma. Sarianidi says he also found dishes with traces of cannabis, poppy and ephedra. According to Sarianidi, this discovery strengthens the theory that these were the ingredients of soma.Sarianidi, Victor, (2003). Margiana and Soma-Haoma. Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies (EJVS), Vol. 9 (2003) Issue 1c (May 5); archived 10 May 2020 The excavations of the settlement of Ulug Tepe, near Dushak in south Turkmenistan, found similar implements for making soma drink, described as a \\"pressure set\\".

The implements, : \\"... consisted of a huge stone mortar and a pestle, a pressing stone with a half-spheric projection in its centre and next to it a similar one with a half-spheric deepening.\\" South Turkmenistan also belonged to the area of Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex. Historical context Scholars believe that the ancient Oxus river culture (Bactria-Margiana) may have its origin at sites like Anau, on the northern slopes of the Kopet-Dag mountains. Anau dates back to 6500 B.C. Later settlements like Gonur may have been founded by people who moved there from the Kopet-Dag area because of changing climate.Andrew Lawler, Central Asia's Lost Civilization -- The unveiling of a 4,000-year-old civilization calls into question conventional ideas about ancient culture, trade, and religion. November 29, 2006 discovermagazine.com Part of the Gonur Depe ruins, 2011 There were increasing incursions of nomadic encampments of the Andronovo culture at the site during the period 1800-1500 BCE. According to Lamberg-Karlovsky, presence of Andronovo pottery at Gonur, the characteristic ceramics of the Eurasian steppes where the modern horse was domesticated, certainly implies that the horse was known to the BMAC. However, Sarianidi disregards the steppe connection for the presence of the horse in BMAC. Mallory (1997) points out that the BMAC fortified settlements such as Gonur and Togolok resemble the qila, the type of fort known in this region in the historical period. They may be circular or rectangular and have up to three encircling walls. Within the forts are residential quarters, workshops and temples.\\"BMAC\\" in: Mallory, J. P.; Adams, D.

The homeland of the Danta is in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), specifically the Hadiya Zone, and less so in the Kembata Tembaro Zone (KT).  Origin, Language and Religion  The Danta, historically and commonly known as Dubamo are a small ethnic group in Ethiopia. Their symbolic center of settlement is the highland area of Danta, after which they are sometimes named. The Danta originally spoke the Kizinya dialect of Kambaata. However, the Danta have made a significant linguistic transition since the Hadiya migrated into their homeland at the beginning of the 19th century. A sizable number of Danta living in their original home have so far resisted assimilation by the Hadiya and still speak their original Kizinya dialect.Braukämper, U., \\"The correlation of oral traditions and historical records in Southern Ethiopia: a case study of the Hadiya-Sidamo past\\", Journal of Ethiopian Studies 11 (1973), 29-50Braukämper, U. \\"Dubamo\\", in Uhlig, S. (ed.). Encyclopedia Aethiopica, Volume 2, p. 202 Historically, Danta is thought to be a \\"state formed in Kambata about 1550-1570\\", and the \\"Dubamo people were known to have slave trade with Jimma even after the anti-slavery proclamation of 1923\\". The Danta \\"were organized in a small kingship whose rulers claim descent from 'King Solomon' of Gondar, i.e. from Amharic nobility\\". The Danta still maintain \\"a tradition that they came from Gondar about 15 generations ago\\" and \\"conserved an outstanding consciousness as an upper stratum tracing their origin to the North Ethiopian Christian area, a stratum which had at one time superimposed itself upon a Kushitic\\" substratum of the indigenous people. To date, it is a common practice for an average Danta to name his or her paternal genealogy going back to more than 20 generations. Braukämper, in one of his other articles on the Danta, suggests that their allusion of their origin to King Solomon and the Amharic nobility may be an astute strategy to legitimization of status and power rather than evidence of an actual hereditary relationship with the north. However, a layman’s analysis of their genealogy (e.g. tribe names and distant ancestral names of individuals) occasionally yields, albeit weakly, names that connote northern connection. Hawzula is a supra-natural deity worshiped by all Danta in the past and still by some to date. The Hawzula spirit 'speaks' and 'works' through the Hawzulmancho, a hereditary Dubamo man on whom the Hawzula spirit descends and dwells on. Hawzula was the arbitrator, councilor and judge on all matters not only for Danta but also for the neighboring peoples such as the Hadiya, Donga, Kambaata and Timbaro. Many Danta confessed Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity after Menelik II’s conquest in the 1880s but evangelical Christianity has become the dominant religion since the 1970s.  The Danta-Dubamo land  The Danta nationality are mainly concentrated in the cool highlands of the Soro, Duna and Misha woredas of the Hadiya Zone, although a large number of Danta also live in the adjoining Doyo Gena woreda of the KT. Reportedly, relatively small clusters of people of some Danta tribes live in the Silt'e and Wolaita Zones. They are known for their intensive cultivation of ensete and barley and for breeding of horses. Dantich farasho, literally meaning \\"the flying horse of Danta\\", is a phrase that is commonly used for eulogy.  Current Political Organization and Representation  Since the federal rearrangement of the Ethiopian state in the 1990s, \\"the Dubamo increasingly became aware of their non-Hadiya origin and started demanding an administrative district of their own\\".Braukämper, U. \\"Controversy over local tradition and national Ethiopian Context: Case study of the Hadiyya\\", in: Afrikas Horn: Akten der Ersten Internationalen Littmann- Konferenz, 2. bis 5. Mai 2002 in München (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), pp. 363-376. From that time, the Danta have repeatedly petitioned the government for recognition and representation as an ethnic group. In the 1990s, the Dubamo refused to acknowledge the Hadiya-dominated local administrators as their legitimate rulers and stopped paying taxes as a token of resistance. Ever since the Danta have been making peaceful political struggle for representation at all administrative levels including the councils at the district, zonal and regional levels and the Houses of Peoples Representatives and Federation at the national level. No definitive answer has so far been given and the case is still active and pending. Local media have reported on the demands of the Dubamo at various times and the Deutsche Welle radio Amharic service has made a lengthy report on the case on 12 May 2009.Copy of Deutsche Welle Story (in Amharic) In the current political configuration, most Danta are either neutral or affiliated with the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. This aside, because of the increasing consciousness of their distinct historical and cultural identity, a few Danta elites living in the area had opted for establishing a legally registered ethnic based political party called the \\"Danta, Dubamo Kinchichila People Democratic Organization\\", and named two candidates for the 2005 general elections.\\"ONC to Participate in Upcoming National Elections\\" , Walta Information Center, 13 November 1999 (last accessed 22 June 2009)Political Parties/Independent Candidates Running for May Elections Parliament Election, Ministry of Foreign Affairs website  References  Category:Ethnic groups in Ethiopia ","title":"Danta people"},{"id":"23196449","text":"Sinaoros or Sina Oros () is a village in the Nicosia District of Cyprus, located 3 km north of Kakopetria.

Rockwell responded with the Ranger 2000 two-seat, single engined cantilever monoplane. The design was based on the work of RFB, in particular the RFB Fantrainer and the prototypes were built in Germany. The Ranger 2000 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D-5C turbofan mounted in the rear fuselage and fed by two air intakes above the wing roots. It used retractable tricycle landing gear, the wing was straight and low-mounted, and the crew of two sat in tandem with the rear instructor raised to maintain visibility. Both crew had a Stencel zero-zero ejection seat. The aircraft first flew on 15 January 1993 at Manching in Germany. The second prototype was lost in an accident on 25 July 1993. The first prototype was shipped to Rockwell in the United States but the first flight of the third prototype was delayed until 20 June 1994 for modification, the main change was the move of the speedbrakes from the upper wing surface to the rear fuselage. The Ranger 2000 did not succeed in the competition, which was won by a variant of the Pilatus PC-9 which became the T-6 Texan II.

Ergonomics in Canada, as in other countries, found its genesis in military procurement. Following the Second World War, military scientists at the Defence Research Board Toronto recognised the basic tenet of ergonomics–that operators (in this case servicemen and women) work more safely and more effectively when the design of the work situation takes account of their anatomical, physiological and psychological characteristics – and adopted it as a significant component of their work.For a brief history of ergonomics at DCIEM, see Sharon McFadden, Communiqué 1989, 19(6):1-3 (Calgary, Alberta: ACE). In due course, the Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine (DCIEM), as this agency was oddly renamed, became the birthplace, in 1968, of the Human Factors Association of Canada (HFAC), the Canadian organisation affiliated to the International Ergonomics Association. In 1984 the Association adopted the name Human Factors Association of Canada/Association canadienne d’ergonomie. In this year also it entered the international scene by sponsoring the International Conference on Occupational Ergonomics in Toronto. In 1999 it changed its name once more, this time to the Association of Canadian Ergonomists/Association canadienne d’ergonomie (ACE). The twenty- nine founding members of the original organisationA photograph of the founding members was published in Communiqué 1982, 12(2):2, together with the minutes of the founding meeting. were mostly military or ex-military persons or functionaries of other government departments. A few were academics; only two were women. In its early days ACE (or HFAC, as it then was) did not make many waves. Members met at least once a year to present papers to each other, but it did not engage seriously in questions of academic and professional status and development. The prevailing mode changed in 1981 when members were persuaded to forsake the Muskoka Lakes in order to hold the annual conference in Toronto. Ergonomists from places outside southern Ontario were now able to find the venue and the organisation began its expansion. Apart from providing a birthplace for ACE, DCIEM also provided its original name. In establishing DCIEM, the Department of National Defence had \\"recognized the importance of human factors\\", and DCIEM claimed \\"the human factors of command systems\\" as one of its areas of competence. In 1968, prevailing opinion in North America was that the term human factors correctly described the domain of interest and did so more appropriately than the term ergonomics. The new association was therefore named accordingly.For an account of the first meeting, see Leslie Innes, Communiqué 1988 18(3):1-3. It thrived for many years with that name but whether the decision impeded, in certain respects, the development of ergonomics in Canada remains questionable. In 1980 the Government of Quebec established in Montreal the Institut de recherche en santé et en sécurité de travail (IRSST) to undertake research aimed at promoting occupational health and safety. From its inception, ergonomics research constituted a significant part of the activity of IRSST, but unlike that of DCIEM, this research was wholly directed to industrial objectives as distinct from what were the military objectives of the latter. IRSST was also distinctive in having representatives of employer organisations and trade unions sitting on its administrative board. In other respects, the two agencies were alike in being government sponsored and, for the most part, government funded, and in giving considerable support to the professional and scientific activities of ACE.For an account of the early development of ergonomics in Quebec, see Denis Giguère and Robert Gilbert, L'Ergonomie au Québec, paper presented at the 20th Annual Conference of ACE (HFAC/ACE) 1987. In 1984 the National Research Council of Canada established the Associate Committee for the Industrial Application of Ergonomics. Drawing members from government agencies, the universities, industry and commerce, and trade unions, the Committee was mandated to promote the application of ergonomics to industry on the assumption that this either was not, or was inadequately, being done already. Committee members set out across Canada to bring the message to workers, managers and employers, with diverse results. In one city two hundred persons attended a one-day workshop sponsored by the Committee while in another barely a dozen turned up. In these workshops the speakers endeavoured to stress the broad scope of ergonomics, pointing out that ergonomics was pertinent not only to occupational health and safety but also to efficiency and effectiveness. The Associate Committee sponsored surveys and seminars implicating government occupational health and safety agencies, ergonomics teachers, trade unions and ACE and successfully raised awareness of the issues. It tried equally to implicate industrialists and engineers but with mixed results (although Bell Northern Research at this time employed the biggest single group of ergonomists in Canada, working on the design of its consumer products). The Committee succeeded in co-sponsoring (with ACE) the appointment of an industry technical advisor by the NRC Industrial Research Assistance Program but failed to persuade the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to establish a grants committee for ergonomics. As a legacy, the Committee left a series of useful publications.The publications of the Associate Committee include Obstacles to the occupational applications of ergonomics 1986, Education for ergonomics 1986, Ergonomics at work 1988, The role of ergonomics in implementing the provisions of occupational health and safety legislation 1989, Proceedings of the national workshop on education and ergonomics 1989, and The role of ergonomics in trade union activity 1990. For a brief history of the Associate Committee, see Robert Webb, Communiqué 1991, 22(4):1-4. Of the institutions that played a role in developing ergonomics in Canada, the universities were the ones whose contribution was most ambivalent. Ergonomics has been taught as a university subject for many years, but in a variety of departments ranging from kinesiology, psychology and biological sciences to industrial relations, industrial engineering, systems engineering and other engineering disciplines. This has had the benefit of bringing to the teaching of ergonomics the full range of knowledge and techniques that the subject calls for, but it led to some disarray. Ergonomics was compelled, in many cases, to occupy the minor role in a department named for and devoted to some other discipline, and what students received (and still receive) was shaped accordingly. No Canadian university has a dedicated Department of Ergonomics. This lack of cohesion is reflected today in the attitudes of managers, trade unionists, and members of the public in general towards ergonomics. For example, the introduction of information technology into the workplace led to changes in workplace structure and procedures that called for the application of ergonomics theory and technique. But ergonomics became associated with the single issue of avoiding repetitive-strain injuries. The topic of man (or, better, operator)-machine interface (MMI) became a hardy perennial to be cultivated and watered at all conferences designed for computer engineers and computer scientists, but it assumed a life of its own divorced from a more comprehensive ergonomic approach. The eventual outcome of this state of affairs remains to be seen. With universities interested more in areas of application (like women's studies, aboriginal studies, environmental studies, management studies) rather than basic disciplines, little relief is likely to come from that area. On the other hand, in 1998, after years of preparation, ACE established the Canadian College for the Certification of Professional Ergonomists/Conseil Canadien de certification des praticiens en ergonomie with a current (2009) membership of more than 130 certified professional ergonomists. Strong professional associations like ACE and CCCPE may make the difference.

The Lazania and other villages were given as a privilege to the new Monastery during the Komnenos dynasty. Also the Monastery had promoted several investments in the area (forest industry, agriculture, farming and mills).

The history of the City University of Applied Sciences traces back to the foundation of the Technikum, a School for Civil Engineering and Shipping in 1894 and the foundation of the Social Women's' School, the first School of Social Work in Bremen in 1918.1 Hochschule Bremen is a member of the UAS7 (Seven Universities of Applied Sciences) network that forms a strategic alliance of seven leading German Universities of Applied Sciences in teaching and research. Campuses The University of Applied Sciences is located at four sites. The central site, where the head office and the Faculties 2 to 5 are arranged, is located in Bremen Neustadt in the street Neustadtswall. The Faculty 1 and the School of International Business can be found at the site Werderstraße. A further site is located near the Bremen Airport where the Center of Computer Science and Media Studies as well as the Institute of Aerospace Technology are arranged. The International Graduate School is situated at the Süderstraße site. Study Around 8.800 students of 69 degree courses (thereof 43 Bachelor-/26 Master's degree courses) in five faculties are matriculated at the Bremen University of Applied Sciences in the academic year 2018/18.2 More than 40 degree courses consist of an obligatory stay abroad being composed of a study and internship abroad. Further attributes of these international degree courses are the language courses of a foreign language as well as the multilingualism of many other courses and also the cooperation with around 300 foreign universities in 2008. Being practically oriented is another characteristic of all degree courses of the University of Applied Sciences which is reflected in the obligatory internship phases. Further more the students are included in many research projects. In 2004, the University of Applied Sciences founded the International Graduate Center (IGC) for being able to provide extra-occupational and full-time post-graduate degrees. The master's degrees are offered predominantly in the domain Management which will end in the degree Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Business Administration (MBA). =International Days= Once a year the International Days take place at the Hochschule Bremen. This event takes two days and is organized by students of the 7th semester of the School of International Business, together with exchange students. The students portray their impressions and experiences which they have made during their stay abroad in the 5th and 6th semester. This is made through information stands, presentations, pictures and culinary specialities. Besides the students are in attendance to answer questions which may be asked by other students or other interested parties. Also exchange students from African, European and South American countries present their home countries on nicely decorated stands and support the students of the 7th semester. This event can be seen as a communication platform for the students of lower semesters, who still have to complete their semester abroad, but it is accessible for every interested person, too. The International Days are a good opportunity to get important and interesting information that may help them to take their decision for the destination of their semester abroad. Additionally it is a possibility to collect contacts e.g. for house hunting and internships. Also presentations about financing possibilities as well as about the different education systems in foreign countries are given by external companies and organisations.hs-bremen.de Entry requirements The general entry requirements are the advanced technical college entrance qualification or the A-levels. Further more there are specific requirements in each degree course like internships, language skills, apprenticeship etc.. Normally the entry of a master's degree course requires a successfully obtained bachelor's degree. Beyond that Bremen offers two further entry possibilities: #The extra accreditation which requires: * A main residence in Bremen and surrounding rural districts for at least 1 year, * A completed apprenticeship and * An examination with a degree as Master, technician or Master of Business Administration etc.. # The classification test which requires: * A main residence in Bremen and surrounding rural districts for at least 1 year, * An apprenticeship for at least 2 years, an alternative would be the job as skilled labor for at least 5 years * Job-related experiences for at least 3 years in one of the domains of the aimed study * Participation in further and professional training Faculties Five faculties cover 69 degree courses, thereof 43 Bachelor's degree courses and 26 Master's degree courses. = Faculty 1: School of International Business (SIB) = Since the 1st of March, 2008 the Faculty 1 forms the School of International Business (SIB), which is a union of the international economic degree courses in the Faculty 1. The SIB offers eleven bachelor's degree courses, one Diploma degree course and ten master's degree courses. The Faculty 1 is split up in three areas for which, in each case, a dean coordinates the lectures, together with the particular head of the degree course. All degree courses of the SIB are aimed internationally and each student will complete their 5th or 6th semester at one of 60 affiliate universities of the School of International Business.  Center of International Relations and Practice contacts  The center of international relations and practise contacts is an independent service institution of the Faculty 1 - School of International Business - for students of the University of Applied Sciences Bremen as well as for exchange students. The main topic is the support of the internationalisation and practice orientation through cooperations and network building with international partner universities, enterprises and institutions.hs-bremen.de = Faculty 2: Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering = = Faculty 3: Social Sciences = The Faculty of Social Sciences focusses on study programs in the areas of social work, health, leisure studies and political sciences. Currently, it offers four Bachelor programs, two Dual Bachelor programs and two Master programs. Four of the programs include an obligatory international semester abroad. The other four take a focus on internationalisation at home and have included elements of internationalisation in the curriculum. In 2019, the School of Social Work could celebrate its 100th anniversary.

The year of foundation of the monastery is not verified, but the writer Stephen Lusignan puts its inception in the late 4th century AD, citing as founder St. Macedonius, who succeeded after St. Trifyllios as Bishop of Ledra and participated in the First Ecumenical Council of 325 AD. The first historically documented testimony to the monastery is found in a sacred text that was written shortly after the martyrdom of thirteen monks of Kantara. Also important is the reference made by Archimandrite Cyprian in \\" Chronological History of the island of Cyprus\\", based on the historical references of Stephen Lusignan, referring to two monasteries, those of Empress Helen and Pallouriotissa. In 1567 the Venetians strengthened the defences of Nicosia by building new walls on a shorter circumference and demolishing all the buildings outside of these in the vicinity. Thus the monastery was demolished. Some time after the Ottoman conquest the monastery was rebuilt this time for males. Last abbot of the monastery was Chrisanthos. With his death in 1888 the monastery fell into debt because of large amounts spent for the repair of the church, the water supply and taxes. Much of the monastery church collapsed after a fire, probably in the mid 19th century. Gradually the church became the parish church for the village and it was rebuilt in 1887\\"Historic Cyprus - A Guide to its Towns and Villages, Monasteries and Castles\\", by Rupert Gunnis (former Inspector of Antiquities in Cyprus), pub 1936, reprinted 1973 by Halkin Sesh Ltd, Nicosia, p 363 and extended retaining only the walls in the apse of the sanctuary.

This quadrangular building is the largest castle in the southern Lüneburg Heath region.  History  Celle Castle is based on a fortified wall tower (Wehrturm) with the character of a water castle, that guarded a ford over the River Aller. This first fortification, called Kellu, was built by a Brunonen count around 980 AD. Another forerunner of the castle, which may have been an extension of the wall tower, was founded in 1292 by Otto the Strict. The cellar vault and the lower stories of the watch tower have survived to the present day. Its ruins lie underneath the castle theatre. Around 1315 the actual Castrum Celle was first recorded. As a consequence of the War of the Lüneburg Succession, in 1378 the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg moved their Residenz from Lüneburg to Celle and began transforming the Burg, now encircled by ditches and embankments, into a Schloss. About a century later the castle was further expanded by Frederick the Pious from 1471–1478, and the castle chapel was consecrated in 1485. Ernest I the Confessor had the castle decorated from 1530 in the Renaissance style. At the same time, between 1520 and 1560, the defences, in the form of ramparts and bastions, were pushed further out. At this time the castle was typical of its era, a quadrangular building with a rectangular courtyard, with massive corner towers, a large main tower and characteristic features of Weser Renaissance. Celle with its castle (right) in an engraving by Matthäus Merian, 1654 From 1670 onwards alterations to the castle were carried out by Duke George William, which were intended to transform the old renaissance seat into a contemporary Residenz. George William was keen on building, typical of the princes of his time, and made further changes that were intended to recall his time in Italy. The façades, that were copied from Venetian buildings, were then given their present-day appearance. Notable features include the corona of gables that encircles the roofs, and the unusual shape of the domed towers. The addition of the castle theatre and the Baroque state rooms stem from this period. Caroline Matilda, who was banished and lived in Celle Castle; 1771 painting On the death of George William in 1705 the absolute rule of the dukes ended. The Principality of Lüneburg subsequently passed, along with the Principality of Calenberg, to the Kingdom of Hanover. The castle lost its political significance and stood empty again for a long time. From 1772 it was occupied by the British-born Danish queen, Caroline Matilda, the daughter of Frederick Lewis, Prince of Wales, who had been banished to Celle as a result of her affair with Johann Friedrich Struensee of Copenhagen. The unhappy queen only lived at the Celle court until 1775, when she died at a relatively young age of scarlet fever. In the 19th century the castle was occasionally used by the Hanoverian royal household as a summer residence. As a result, Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves had several interior alterations made in 1839 and 1840. During World War I, it was used as a detention camp for officers (Offizerslager or Oflag) by the German Army. = The castle today = The castle still has a variety of rooms and halls that date back over different periods. The court chapel was converted after the Reformation and has been preserved almost unchanged with its renaissance architecture. The baroque-style state rooms were created under George William and have also been preserved. In the Gothic Hall there are constantly changing exhibitions and in the East Wing is a section of Celle's Bomann Museum, which is dedicated to the history of the Kingdom of Hanover. The historic castle rooms and the castle chapel, restored between 1978 and 1981, may be visited as part of a guided tour.  Castle Theatre  The court theatre of the castle, the Schlosstheater Celle, is one of the oldest preserved theatres of its kind and one of the few baroque theatres in North Germany. It still has its own theatre company today. The present Schlosstheater was built on the instigation of Duke George William, who before he came to power spent some time in Venice and came to know Italian opera whilst he was there. The theatre was designed by the Italian architect Giuseppe Arighini. Construction work on the theatre began in 1670 and was largely finished by 1675. The duke hosted a succession of theatre companies, that he recruited, for example, from France, Italy and also nearby Hanover. On the death of the duke the theatre became orphaned until the short-lived stay of Caroline Matilda, for whom the theatre was given a second gallery. The theatre was conceived for the benefit of the court and was never intended to be open to the public, who were first allowed a moderate degree of access to plays at the end of the 18th century. The theatre was regularly used until the late 19th century, but was closed in 1890 and fell into disuse. In 1935 it underwent a thorough renovation.  Castle Park  View from Celle town church of Celle Castle and its parks Because the castle was never used for any military purposes, between 1785 and 1802 the outer bastions were dismantled and used as fill for the once deep, wide castle moats. In 1826 gardens were laid out in the vicinity of the castle by levelling and removing the defensive embankments. In their place, trees and shrubs were planted and lawns laid. In the 19th century a landscape garden was created in the area immediately surrounding the castle. Since part of the park was given away for building residential accommodation around 1900, the park has retained an area of about . The castle still sits on an island today that is surrounded by moats. Outside the former defensive belt, but not far from the castle, George William had the French Garden (\\"Französischer Garten\\"), a baroque park designed on French lines, laid out in the late 17th century. This was later converted to an English landscape garden, but the former baroque layout can still be made out in certain areas of the park.  Literature  * Horst Masuch: Das Schloß in Celle.

Such disciplines include biochemistry, cell biology, physiology, pharmacology or psychosocial aspects of health. It is an equivalent level qualification to the more commonly awarded Bachelor of Science (BSc). Graduates may enter a diverse range of roles including post-graduate study, higher education, the biotechnology industry, the pharmaceutical industry, consultancy roles, scientific communication, education or unrelated disciplines which make use of the broad range of transferable skills gained through this degree. Australia In Australia, the Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSc) degree is offered by The University of Adelaide, Griffith University, University of New South Wales, University of Sydney, Monash University, Australian National University, University of Western Sydney, University of Newcastle, Flinders University, Charles Sturt University, Macquarie University , Central Queensland University and The University of the Sunshine Coast. Canada At the University of Western Ontario, BMSc is a four-year degree offered by the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. It is differentiated from a BSc due to the advanced medical sciences orientation of the courses offered such as Anatomy and Pharmacology. The University of Alberta offers a BMSc to Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry students who did not complete a Bachelor's degree prior to entry into the program. India In India, BMSc is an undergraduate degree offered by top universities like Panjab University, Punjabi University and the Indian Institutes of Technology. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the Bachelor of Medical Sciences degree can be awarded in three situations; firstly as a standalone 3-year first degree, secondly, as a consequence of taking an extra year during a medical or dental course (termed intercalating), or thirdly as an additional part of a medical degree but without any additional years of study. When the degree is obtained without any additional years of study, it may not be viewed as an equivalent qualification. For example, the UK Foundation Programme Office (the British body which manages first jobs for new medical graduates) places less value on a BMedSc degree if an additional year of study has not been undertaken.FP/AFP 2016 Foundation Programme Reference Guide (pdf) available from http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/download.asp?file=FP_Reference_Guide_2016_V2-1.pdf Regardless of the way in which the degree is obtained, a research project typically forms a large component of the degree as well as formal teaching in medical science related disciplines. Bachelor of Medical Sciences degrees are awarded as a standalone 3 year course by the University of Chester, University of Exeter, University of Birmingham, the University of Sheffield, Bangor University, Oxford Brookes University, De Montfort University, and the University of St Andrews. Medical schools which award an intercalated Bachelor of Medical Sciences after an additional year of study are Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, the University of Birmingham, the University of Dundee, the University of Edinburgh the University of Aberdeen and the University of Sheffield. The University of Nottingham and the University of Southampton award the degree as a standard part of their undergraduate medicine courses without an additional year of study (students must undertake a research project). Egypt  In Egypt, the bachelor of medical sciences is awarded after four years of study in addition to an internship year in which interns are trained in multiple public and university hospitals. The degree is offered in five universities in Egypt: October 6 University, Misr University for Science and Technology, Pharos University in Alexandria, Beni-Suef University and Menoufia University. Faculties of applied medical sciences offer various disciplines for students to choose from, including medical laboratories, radiology and medical imaging, therapeutic nutrition, and biomedical equipment. In 2015, the Central Authority For Organization and Administration (CAOA) granted the holders of the bachelor of medical sciences the title of \\"specialist\\" in the corresponding specialty.

History Native American tribes hunted and gathered along the shores of the estuary at least 8,500 years before European settlers arrived. Shell middens, the refuse of hunting-gathering societies, show the earliest inhabitants relied heavily on coastal resources, including foods such as scallops, clams, shark, barracuda, bonito, and abalone. More recently, the Kumeyaay occupied the area. They traveled seasonally to take advantage of resources both along the coast and inland. In 1769, the Portola Expedition named the area San Alejo in honor of Saint Alexius. In the early 1800s, Spaniards and other Europeans settled the region and established cattle ranches. The California Gold Rush brought an ever-increasing influx of people. Settlers established the community of Olivenhain, along Escondido Creek, as an experimental farming community. Farmers plough and planted the riparian corridors upstream of the estuary. It was the first time habitation had radically changed the vegetation and terrain surrounding the lagoon. Non- native plants were introduced that later proved highly invasive. Between 1880 and 1940, dikes and levees were built that allowed duck hunting, salt harvesting, and sewage settling ponds. The most permanent changes were the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad in 1887, Pacific Coast Highway 101 in 1891, and Interstate 5 in 1965. Each required supporting berms that restricted water circulation and the natural influx of ocean water.San Elijo Lagoon Conservancy - Annual Inlet Excavation In 2016, as part of the North Coast Corridor infrastructure project, both road and rail bridges across the lagoon were planned to be replaced by 2021, in addition to environmental restoration of the lagoon and added preserved acreage. Geography and natural features San Elijo Lagoon as seen from a helicopter, 2011 The lagoon lies within the southernmost part of the city of Encinitas and is bordered by Solana Beach on the south and Rancho Santa Fe inland and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The Reserve encompasses an area of . The lagoon is the terminus of the Escondido Creek watershed which covers an area of . The water in the lagoon comes from the Escondido Creek watershed and the Pacific Ocean. The Reserve is managed by the California Department of Fish and Game,CA Dept. of Fish and Game - San Elijo Lagoon Ecological Reserve County of San Diego,County of San Diego: San Elijo Lagoon Ecological Reserve and San Elijo Lagoon Conservancy.San Elijo Lagoon Conservancy Habitat and wildlife Within its there are six plant communities: coastal strand, salt marsh, riparian scrub, coastal sage scrub, freshwater marsh, and mixed chaparral. There are more than 300 species of plants, at least 23 species of fish, 26 mammal species, 20 reptiles and amphibians, more than 80 invertebrates, and 300 bird species.San Elijo Lagoon - A San Diego Ecological Reserve San Elijo Lagoon is part of the Escondido Creek Watershed. Within its approximately , stretching from the foothills to the coastline, the last remnants of an imperiled coastal scrub habitat connecting the northern and southern parts of an important ecological region. This coastal scrub habitat is vital to San Diego County's open space network and to the persistence of some of Southern California's most endangered species, many of which occur nowhere else. Nature center Visitors can begin their exploration of San Elijo Lagoon Ecological Reserve at the San Elijo Lagoon Nature Center.San Elijo Lagoon Nature Center The nature center provides a unique glimpse for the public to see \\"green\\" building concepts in use. The building is Platinum-Certified by U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The two-story building is made from recycled materials and relies on solar energy, with natural light and ventilation. Visitors can see solar panels and irrigated roof plants. Recycled water is used in landscape irrigation. The Nature Center opened to the public in Spring 2009, replacing the former center that opened in 1988. Inside are nature and history exhibits that detail the lagoon's plant and animal communities, Native American history, and the various natural and human influences that affect this sensitive ecosystem. San Elijo Lagoon Nature Center is San Diego County owned and operated. Rangers are on staff daily from 9 am until 5 pm, except Christmas Day. There is free parking. Recreation of trails, open from dawn until dusk, wind through distinct plant communities of San Elijo Lagoon Ecological Reserve. A short hike to see the wetlands begins at the Nature Center in a loop with views of the lagoon and salt marsh habitat animal sightings. Other trailstrails take about 1.5 hours to complete. Most are considered easy to moderate for hiking and jogging. There are no restroom facilities located on the trails. Dogs are allowed on leashes. All wildlife and natural resources are fully protected in the California state and county reserve. Scientific monitoring Successful efforts by County of San Diego, State of California, and San Elijo Lagoon Conservancy have greatly improved water quality, habitat, and biodiversity. There are actively maintained projects that focus on water quality testing, habitat restoration, invasive plant removal, and bird counts. There are continuous and weekly water quality measurements taken of the lagoon's water that test the water for dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and pH levels. The water measurements help determine the health of the ecosystem and also when mouth of the lagoon should be reopened. The lagoon’s mouth, located at Cardiff State Beach, is mechanically dredged and reopened each spring following the last winter storm. The opening of the mouth of the lagoon restores the tidal circulation between the lagoon and the ocean which ensures a healthier ecosystem. Restoring native plants and removing invasive plant species helps restore the native habitat. This is important since numerous organisms rely on native plants for food and protection. Invasive plants upset the ecosystem by crowding out and out-competing native vegetation. The invasive plants are removed by either spraying herbicide or by manual pulling. Native plants are then planted to restore the habitat. Bird counts are conducted on a monthly basis in the lagoon. Approximately 40% of all bird species in North America have been spotted in the lagoon.San Elijo Lagoon Conservancy - Bird Count Conducting the bird count helps keep track of how some of the threatened and endangered species are doing.

He worked in Major League Baseball umpire from 1921 to his death in 1928, serving stints in both the American and National Leagues. Early career He began playing professional baseball as a catcher in the old Class C South Atlantic League (\\"Sally League\\") in 1911, but had to give up playing early in that season due to an arm injury. He then umpired college baseball games, before moving up to the then-Class AA Western League. In 1921, Wilson was appointed as an American League umpire by Ban Johnson. Two years later, in 1923, he became a National League umpire. Notable games In May 1922, player-manager Ty Cobb and outfielder Harry Heilmann of the Detroit Tigers engaged in a heated argument with Wilson during a game with the St. Louis Browns. Cobb, it was alleged, deliberately stepped on Wilson's foot during the confrontation and then refused to leave the field after Wilson ejected him from the game, resulting in Cobb's suspension by American League President Ban Johnson on May 30. However, a dispute over the game ensued between Johnson and Wilson; the umpire resigned early in the season and joined the National League staff for 1923. In a spring training game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Braves in St. Petersburg, Florida, on March 24, 1927, Wilson ejected nine Yankee players early in the game for heckling him from the bench, only to have them return unnoticed to the dugout later in the game. In the fifth inning, the New York Times reported the next day, Wilson discovered their transgression after he called out Babe Ruth in an attempt to steal home, whereupon he ejected the same nine Yankees a second time, prompting the Times reporter to write sardonically that, \\"It was fortunate that Mr. Wilson was in such an amusing frame of mind\\". Death On June 12, 1928, Wilson died of acute appendicitis at Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn, New York at age 38. He was survived by his wife and two sons. He fell ill more than a week before his death and underwent two surgeries before he died.

It was founded in 1965 by six partners: Ralph Eckerstrom, Massimo Vignelli, Bob Noorda, James Fogelman, Wally Gutches, and Larry Klein. Although they were not listed as founding partners, Jay Doblin and Robert Moldafsky joined the new firm almost immediately. Initially, Unimark had three offices: Chicago, Milan and New York. Additional offices opened around the world, but these were often short-lived as the client base and funding varied, and as American and global economic issues influenced the viability of each office. Unimark downsized dramatically in 1972 and filed for final Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1977. It no longer exists. Although the firm was relatively short-lived, it was at one time the largest design firm in the world, and it had a major influence on the direction of American design aesthetics. The firm was a leader in establishing a modernist philosophical direction for corporate design that is still widely followed. Former Bauhaus designer Herbert Bayer was an early member of the firm's Board of Directors. The graphic style of Unimark's projects was decidedly modernist. Unimark rejected the idea of the designer-as-artist, embraced standardization and systems and emphasizing the use of the grid as an organizational tool for corporate communications. The typeface Helvetica was widely, though not exclusively, used by Unimark designers. The firm was an early specialist in designing corporate identity systems, branding, and signage systems. Clients included American Airlines, Ford Motor Company, Gillette, JC Penney, Knoll, and the New York Transit Authority who continue to use Unimark-created trademarks and graphic standards. Due to the significance and history of the Unimark name, a number of copy-cat design companies have adopted the name in order to attract business. However, none of the current firms or their employees are connected in any way to the original Unimark International. Along with the archives of founder Massimo Vignelli, many of the Unimark archives are now housed in the Vignelli Center for Design Studies at Rochester Institute of Technology.

The series was produced by Tornante Animation in association with Cuppa Coffee Studios and Rogers Communications. Glenn Martin, DDS was Nick at Nite's fourth original series (the first was Hi Honey, I'm Home!, the second was Fatherhood and the third was Hi-Jinks). The show premiered on March 18, 2010 on Sky1 in the UK and Ireland. Season two premiered on June 11, 2010. The show ended on November 7, 2011. And continued to air reruns until September 30, 2012. Overview After accidentally burning down his house in Freeland, Pennsylvania, Glenn Martin takes his family — wife Jackie, hormone-addled 13-year-old Conor, power suit- wearing 11-year-old Courtney, Courtney's overachieving assistant Wendy, and Canine (the family's dog who has an oversized anus) — on a cross-country road trip to strengthen the family bond together Cast and characters *Kevin Nealon as Dr. Glenn Campbell Martin, an optimistic travelling dentist who dreams of becoming closer with his family. He is a Doctor of Dental Surgery. *Catherine O'Hara as Jackie Robinson Martin, Glenn's wife and the mother of Conor and Courtney. She is often stressed with the problems involved in raising a family in an RV. *Peter Oldring as Conor Martin, the thirteen-year- old son of the Martins. He is going through puberty and is hormonal. He also tends to be the subject of pratfalls due to his clumsiness. He also has a crush on Wendy, but always gets rejected. *Jackie Clarke as Courtney Martin, the eleven-year-old daughter of the Martins, who acts like an adult business woman. She is competitive, outspoken and boastful. *Judy Greer as Wendy Park (real name Bon Wa-Fo) is Courtney's assistant and employee. She was born in North Korea. Her age is unclear; Glenn has referred to her as a tweenager, but she later claims to be thirteen years old. *Canine, the Martins' dog who has an oversized anus. Development Former Disney chief executive Michael Eisner, who put up his own money to produce the pilot episode, pitched it to Nick at Nite rather than ABC. Eisner was quoted as saying the decision was based on Nick at Nite's record of nurturing shows. The show has a 1970s sensibility including the design of the Winnebago which is driven across the country. It was reportedly inspired by the 1971 ABC made-for-TV movie In Search of America, which starred Jeff Bridges as a college dropout who drove a Winnebago across the country with his family. Laugh track Unusual for a modern animated sitcom, the show featured a laugh track in early episodes intended to mimic 1970s sitcoms. This was later removed at the request of the series' creators, with Eric Fogel citing the show having \\"too much internal thinking\\". Part of the criticism was leveled at the overuse of laugh tracks (which were permanently removed a month after the show's premiere). Mike Hale of The New York Times wrote: \\"Glenn Martin, DDS is pretty much laugh-free (though it does have a laugh track)\\". The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Ignore the stilted jokes [and] the limp characterization. [...] Just understand this: Martin is an animated show with a laugh track. Imagination comes in handy, though, in trying to figure out how someone approved this concept, labored on this and then let it free into the world.\\" Awards and nominations In December 2009, the show was nominated for an Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production. In November 2010, the show won two Gemini Awards for Best Animated Series and Best Direction for an Animated Series (Cuppa Coffee/Ken Cunningham for \\"The Tooth Will Set You Free\\"). Episodes Critical reception Glenn Martin, DDS received mixed to negative reviews from critics, garnering a 48/100 from Metacritic based on 9 reviews after the series premiere. Variety wrote: \\"Despite the contributions of Eric Fogel (MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch), Glenn Martin isn't as bad as visiting the dentist, but isn't much better than sitting in the waiting room. Positioned as a spoof of classic sitcoms, Glenn Martin gets off to a bad start by incorporating a laugh track, which only highlights some of the deficiencies in the writing.\\" The Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Still, except for the dog's hindquarters, I like the look of it. (Eric Fogel of MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch oversees the animation.) Press materials indicate that the Martins will be visiting Las Vegas, Yellowstone, the Mall of America and Hollywood in future adventures, and as a fan of the form, I'm interested to see what the animators make of them.\\" New York Daily News writer David Hinkley gave the show 4 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"satire with biting wit\\". The Boston Globe called it \\"cute, giggle-worthy, and only a smidgen dangerous\\". The Detroit News wrote that the show is \\"full of enough end-of-the week laughs to help you giggle yourself into the weekend\\". Website Shakefire.com rated the show an \\"A-\\". =Controversy= In November 2009, Maura Buete, a Florida mother and anti-vax advocate, was outraged that the series contained sexual references despite airing in an 8 p.m. weekday slot, immediately following the children's show SpongeBob SquarePants. In response to several complaints from parents, Nickelodeon (whose spokesman David Bittler had stated complaints were minimal) moved the show to Friday nights at 10:30 p.m. References External links * Category:2000s American adult animated television series Category:2010s American adult animated television series Category:2000s American sitcoms Category:2010s American sitcoms Category:2009 American television series debuts Category:2011 American television series endings Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:Canadian adult animated comedy television series Category:American stop-motion adult animated television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Nick at Nite original programming Category:Animated television series about families Category:Television series created by Eric Fogel Category:Television series by The Tornante Company Category:Television series by Cuppa Coffee Studios ","title":"Glenn Martin, DDS"},{"id":"23197418","text":"KSHR-FM (97.3 FM, \\"K-Shore\\") is a radio station licensed to serve Coquille, Oregon, United States.

Murphy & Sons. The company, based in Kentish Town, with its green vans and lorries, works on building sites across the UK and Ireland. His late brother Joe also went into construction in London, trading as Murphy Ltd and using grey vehicles, but that company went into administration and closed in 2013. Biography Murphy was born at Loughmark, near Cahersiveen, County Kerry. He left school at 15 but found work hard to come by. He travelled to London and started up as a subcontractor in the building trade. The Second World War offered him a golden opportunity. New airfields were urgently needed and later on runway repairs were needed also. He was successful in providing this service and at end of the war was well placed to help with large-scale reconstruction. Other ventures included electrification, cable installation, water facilities and road-building. At his death in 2009, his worth was estimated at about £190 million. He valued his privacy and was known to spend little on luxuries, instead preferring to spend time with his own workmen and other Irish friends. J Murphy & Sons In the 1970s a specialist division of the company worked on the development of natural gas. Later projects included the Stansted Airport Rail Link, work in the City of London, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and London’s Olympic Park. In 2007 J Murphy and Sons generated nearly £500 million of revenue and made pre-tax profits of £60 million. It was appointed lead contractor in the £125 million Liverpool-Manchester water pipeline project, which is to carry up to 100 million litres of water per day. After Murphy's death in May 2009, leadership of the company passed initially to his daughter Caroline, who had been appointed deputy chairperson of the group in 2007. She later planned to turn the business into a worker’s Co-op owned by its 3,500 employees, but other board members — notably her mother, brother and half-brother — resisted, and she resigned in 2014. The company was then led by Steve Hollingshead until the appointment in 2017 of John Murphy's grandson, John B Murphy. In the year to 31 December 2017 the company made a pre-tax profit of £12.43m from a turnover of £711m, and had 3,878 employees. In 2018, it experienced a slow down in growth, and cancelled its Christmas Party as part of a cost-cutting drive affecting jobs across the business.

Fresco paintings depicting scenes from the Old Testament in the nave and the New Testament scenes from the life of St Peter in the chancel were executed by the Roman painters of German origin Alexander Maximillian and Lodovico Seitz, except for two frescoes which were painted by Achille Ansiglioni. The scenes from the life of St Peter were partially made according to the drawings created for Đakovo Cathedral by one of the leading Nazarene painters Friedrich Overbeck. The landscaped park from the 19th century near the bishop's palace is a horticultural monument under special protection as well as the nearby Small Park (Mali Park) dating from the turn of the 19th/20th century. Đakovo Cathedral was built in 4 years, and another 12 years was spent decorating the inside.

Preparation options  There are many resources and services on which students may draw as they prepare for standardized tests, including: * Mock exams: Mock exams are practice exams that help students prepare for the real exam. They are intended to give students a clear indication of the structure and content of the actual exam, as well as a snapshot of their current performance. * Mind Maps: Mind maps allow students to visually organize relevant concepts and information, showing relationships among pieces of the whole. * Study Guides: Various organizations and individuals produce published materials that students can incorporate into their preparation. * Courses: Many test preparation courses are designed to expose students to the breadth of topics tested on the relevant exam and guide them through the process of studying. * Tutors: A tutor is a person with whom students work one-on-one to improve academic performance, in this case on an exam. * Study groups: Studying as group facilitates collaboration and exposes students to different perspectives on the material. Resource providers Most companies and educators that offer test preparation services also offer traditional (hard copy) and technology-based learning tools, such as books and other printed matter, software, websites, hand-held devices, or content for such devices.

Located on the Black Sea coast, 20 km west of Bourgas. Date built 1950. Home to the HQ and 1st Sqn of the 15th FAR, 2nd Air Defence Division, initially with the MiG-21 but in 1989 received the MiG-29. Since 1994 called the 6th Fighter Air Base of the Tactical Air Corps. Closed in 2000 and demolished.  Short history First Squadron Emblem Bulgarian Air Force Mig-29 Ravnets Air Base housed a squadron (flying MiG-21s, later MiG-29s) of the 17th Fighter Air Regiment - an integral part of the 2nd Air Defence Division. Later, as 5th Fighter Air Base it was put under the newly established Air Defence Corps and its squadron was named \\"Sharks\\"(although unofficially, but still because of its patch and its geographical location close to the sea this is how it used to be called). The base was considered elite because of its proximity to the Turkish border and its task to protect the oil refinery near Burgas, which is deemed of strategical importance to the country. That is the reason for the squadron to be the first (and only) transiting to the MiG-29. As the base deactivated the air unit was moved to Graf Ignatievo, where it is currently residing as 2nd Squadron of the 3rd Fighter Air Base.  History  On August 14, 1950, the 26th Flying Airpolk (successor to the US Army 2/6 Hogwarts Army Bombing Defense Force) was renamed to the 15th Colonel Aviation Regiment, at which time the division was based on Bozhurishte Airport, a few months earlier - in March - from Karlovo airport). 15th Avirpolk is the first step in the recovery of the reactive technology in Bulgaria - May 1950 - Yak-23. In the second half of 1951 the regiment was rearmed with MiG-15. On April 14, 1952, the unit was transported to Bezmer Airport and four months later to the newly built Ravnets Airport. A little later, the regiment was hugged with the MiG-17F. From May 1963 (after the disembarkation of the 27th Navy in Balchik) the 15th Yap became a double base - two squadrons at Ravnets Airport (one with MiG-17 and one with MiG-17PF from the disbanded 27th Japanese). one squadron (third) at Balchik Airport, MiG-17F. In 1967, the first 15th squadron was rearmed with 12 MiG-21FPM fighters. In 1970 the regiment again entered the two-story structure - the first squadron in Ravnets (MiG-21PFM) and the second in Balchik (MiG-17PF and MiG-17F). In 1978, a second squadron was rearmed with the MiG-21FMM (second hand donated by the USSR). For a year (from autumn 1983 to September 1984), the regiment was again with a three-layer structure - the third squadron was again set up with the idea of being disarmed with instant-25PD interceptors, but soon this idea was abandoned. the interest of Gabrovnitsa's rearmament with the MiG-23MDD. In 1988, a first part of the ITS departments and departments undergo training in the USSR, and from summer of the following year it became a MiG-29 firearm which ended in 1990, Since 1990, the second squadron has been rearmed with the MiG-21bis (again a second hand, again a USSR gift). Since September 1, 1994, the 15th place has been disbanded and two air bases have been created at its base - 5 in Ravnets and 6 in Balchik. In 2000, the fifth aaab was converted to the 5th Air Base, which virtually ceased to exist (in 2001, flights were carried out - the transfer of several aircraft to Graf Ignatievo, although most of them were onshore).

Initially, the karahafu was used only in temples and aristocratic gateways, but starting from the beginning of the Azuchi–Momoyama period, it became an important architectural element in the construction of a daimyōs mansions and castles. The karamon entrance was reserved for the shōgun during his onari visits to the retainer, or for the reception of the emperor at shogunate establishments. A structure associated with these social connections naturally imparted special meaning.Sarvimaki: Structures, Symbols and Meanings (2000), 18/2000, 82–84, 178.

It was published by Simon & Schuster. Keane claims his book is the first attempt to write a full history of democracy for well over a century - the last such attempt he states on this scale was by the American Nahum Capen, whose first volume was published in 1874. Some have claimed to have already provided such a comprehensive history, but Keane has rejected this claim.John Keane, Why I wrote this book, Video by the author, Watch it here.See also John Keane's response to John Dunn Keane's book deals with the meaning and institutions of democracy, historical roots and its present-day trends. The starting point in Keane's history is to re-consider democracy's roots. Fifth century BCE Athens (Greece), for many the cradle of democracy, was an important stage of the development process of democracy, but certainly not its point of origin. The origins of the idea of this new way of governing stretch beyond the Peloponnesus' coasts and date back to the ancient civilizations of Syria- Mesopotamia (ca. 2500 BCE). This and other discoveries that the book unearths are not a merely antiquarian exercise, for it is argued that these are historical facts that force us to rethink some of the core ideas that have influenced historians of the past, and, more importantly, shape the politics of the present. Not only does Keane propose that democratic assemblies have Eastern origins, Keane also strongly questions the old assumption that democracy is a universal norm that reflects Western values; hence, he argues that the future of democracy is not tied neither to the West, nor to representative democracy, its current most widely adopted form. See for instance, the history of India, which shows the possibilities of multiethnic democracies – Keane calls it \\"banyan democracy\\", and of Islam, that many consider the antithesis of democracy and instead has a neglected democratic tradition. Ideally, Keane writes, \\"the democratic ideal thinks in terms of government of the humble, by the humble, for the humble, everywhere, any time. Its universality, the applicability of this ideal across borders, in a wide variety of settings, whether in South Africa, China, Russia or the European Union, stems from its active commitment to what might be called 'pluriversality',\\" that is \\"the yearning of the democratic ideal to protect the weak and to empower people everywhere, so that they can get on with living their diverse lives on earth freed from the pride and prejudice of moguls and magnates, tyrants and tycoons.\\" But ideals often do not conform to reality, and in this book Keane considers all the ways in which democracies have gone wrong over the course of history. The book begins with a rather radical examination of the origins of the family of terms to which the word democracy belongs; the author goes onto explore the evolution and mutations of the language and institutions of democracy through the centuries, and its often hotly disputed meanings. Looking beyond the Athens-Runnymede-Philadelphia axis, Keane traces democracy's roots back to Sumeria and follows its tendrils as far afield as Pitcairn Island and Papua New Guinea. At the core of Keane's book is the author's belief that history is a necessary key for understanding democracy in the present time. Keane's worldwide perspective is an important corrective to the (mainly Western) idea that democracy has one and only distinctive form; one type of model that can be brought as a gift to peoples with different attitudes and histories. There is no such a thing as a singular form of democracy. Following the line of thinking that history is the only way we can make sense of what democracy means, The Life and Death of Democracy provides fresh details of the obscure origins of old institutions and ideals like government by public assembly, female enfranchisement; the secret ballot, trial by jury, and parliamentary representation. Keane's book shows as well that ideas of democratic governance have flourished in many different places and were often sparked by undemocratic ideas and actions. The road to democracy was often paved by opposite intentions. For instance, Keane shows that one effect of the early Islamic expansion was the creation of self- governing communities that needed to exist independently from the metropolis. The first experiments in female suffrage were made on the fringes of the British Empire: for imperial reasons, women were given the vote on Pitcairn Island in 1838. Furthermore, Keane's historical works shows that those fringes were important laboratories of democracy. Australia is a case in point: \\"In the colony of South Australia, first settled in 1836 and later called by many the Paradise of Dissent, the spirit of aristocracy was extinguished by settlers who thought of themselves as fair-minded, God-respecting men and women of the improving classes\\". And Australians were the first to experiment with ideas of proportional representation and the secret ballot. The book attempts to explain democracy's global spread in modern times, the contrasting criticisms it attracts and the serious, perhaps fatal, problems afflicting it. As the Times of London columnist, David Aaranovitch wrote: \\"One of the many strengths of Keane's enterprise is its challenge to democratic parochialism, and the time it takes to examine democratic forms in the developing and post- colonial worlds. Who cannot benefit from a description of the early 20th- century Uruguayan system of the \\"double simultaneous vote\\", in which you could vote for a party and for a faction within that party? And Keane's primary example of postwar democracy is not European or North American, but the messy miracle of Indian democracy.\\" Keane stresses that the idea that people could govern themselves was not a simple one. On the contrary it implied something that continues to have a radical bite in the present time: that humans could invent and use institutions specially designed to allow them to decide for themselves, as equals, is a thought that may seem very common nowadays but was extraordinarily innovative at its conception. Following this line of thinking, the book challenges the common view of democracy as a timeless fulfilment of our political destiny with built-in historical guarantees, emphasising that democracy is not a way of doing politics that has always been with us or will unquestionably be with us forever, but instead it is an evolving, adaptable political form of a rather frail nature, especially at times when there are signs of mounting disagreement about its meaning, its efficacy, and desirability. An important mainstay of Keane's account of the history of democracy is the need to understand the inner fragility of democracy – in fact for the author that is a precondition for the survival of democracy. Democracy is by no means indestructible. By 1941, in fact as Keane points out, there were only 11 functioning democracies left in the world. In less than 50 years the work of many dictators and demagogues in the name of 'the people' had almost succeeded in wiping democracy from the pages of our history books. The present time is no different, Keane warns: \\"the enemies of democracy are on the rise, and even pundits and panjandrums half sympathetic to it are openly cynical about claims that it is a desirable way of life for all the people of the planet\\". From Keane's history, democracy emerges less as a set of fixed principles and much more as a culture and mindset—pragmatic, antiauthoritarian, accepting of change and contingency and the ability of ordinary people to shape them. Democracy is first and foremost a uniquely humble and humbling way of life. \\"Democracy\\" writes Keane \\"thrives on humility\\" not on the arrogance of first principles. However the humility in this case, the author warns us, should never be confused with \\"docile meekness or submission\\". Humility in fact is for Keane \\"the cardinal democratic virtue, the antidote of arrogant pride: it is the quality of being aware of one's own and others' limits.\\" This is a crucial element of democratic life: \\"People who are humble try to live without illusions. They dislike vanity and dishonesty; nonsense on stilts and lies and bullshit sitting on thrones are not their scene.\\" Unyielding, humility is what gives individuals \\"inner strength to act upon the world\\". Humility dislikes hubris. For Keane to think \\"of democracy as a uniquely humble and humbling ideal is to give up on the old-hat idea that democracy rests upon some or other First Principle– the Nation, History, God, Truth, Utility, the Market, the infallible Sovereign People or its Leader.\\" To think of democracy as a uniquely humble and humbling ideal is – Keane remarks – \\"to see instead that democracy is a precondition of the flourishing of different values and ways of life around the world is to rid democracy of its connotations of moral arrogance, sectional rule, bullying and force.\\" Democracy is therefore a \\"codeword for humility\\" that in turns means \\"to say goodbye to the worn-out nineteenth- and twentieth-century European liberal rejection of democracy as a headstrong and perilous ideal that 'by the help of a demagogue and a mystical faith in \\"the people\\" or \\"the masses\\" leads to tyranny and the rule of the sword'. Above all, for Keane, it is crucial to \\"rid democracy of its demons\\" and speak of it only in terms of humbling, that is a crucial point in our present understanding of democracy: it is \\"to redescribe the democratic ideal as a potentially universal check against every form of humbug and hubris, as a humble and humbling ideal that gathers strength from the vision that, although citizens and representatives require institutions to govern, no body should rule.\\"  Structure  In The Life and Death of Democracy, Keane argues that the history of democracy can be divided in three different phases. These correspond to three different governing models: the assembly, the representative, and the monitory. The first two are quite known, the third is the brainchild of Keane's study of the subject. Accordingly, the book is divided in three different sections. The first section deals with the origins of democracy and the assembly model. It locates the origins of public assemblies not in Athens but in the Middle East two thousands years before Pericles. And from that original cradle in Syria and Mesopotamia, early assembly democracy slowly moved westwards, through Phoenicia into the Greek world, where it was to be claimed as a Greek invention. \\"The little word democracy\\" Keane writes \\"is much older than classical Greek commentators made out\\". The author traces its roots to the Linear B script of the Mycenaean period, seven to ten centuries earlier, to the late Bronze Age civilization (c. 1500-1200 BCE) that was centred on Mycenae and other urban settlements of the Peloponnese region. Similarly, Keane adds, contrary to what other scholars have pointed out, \\"the democratic practice of self-governing assemblies is also not a Greek innovation\\" but instead its roots are to be found in the 'East' and, more specifically, in Mesopotamia, lands that geographically correspond to contemporary Syria, Iraq and Iran. Keane unearths evidences of citizen assemblies in the ancient Middle East, in the sacred city of Nippur - one of the oldest Babylonian settlements on the Euphrates and the place where Enlil is supposed to have created humanity. Nippur is a striking example of early self-governing assemblies. The example cited by Keane is that of the men of Nippur called upon to decide the fate of four people accused of killing Lu-Inanna, the son of a local priest; the four, including the victim's wife guilty of covering up the murder, were sentenced to death. The custom of popular self-government was later transported both eastwards and westwards, only to arrive later in Athens, where during the fifth century BCE it was claimed as something unique to the West, as a sign of its superiority over the 'barbarism' of the East\\". The second part of the book is dedicated to the invention of the representative model. Shaped by forces as varied as the rebirth of towns, the rise (in northern Spain) of the first parliaments, and the conflicts unleashed by self- governing councils and religious dissent within the Christian Church, democracy came to be understood as representative democracy in this second phase. Contrary to what other sources have often suggested, Keane points out that the oldest roots of that democratic model are in fact undemocratic. The first parliament was not English, but Spanish. Keane locates the birth of representative parliaments in the cloisters of San Isidoro Church, in León, Northern Spain - the site where King Alfonso IX convened the first cortes in 1188 CE. Yet it took several centuries before the term representation began to be used in conjunction with democracy. The birthplace of talk of 'representative democracy' – unknown to the Greeks - was late-eighteenth century France, England and the new American republic. To find a common accepted definition of the word and of the actual meaning of representation (who was entitled to represent whom and what had to be done when representatives disregarded those whom they were supposed to represent ) was by no means an easy task to accomplish. Much ink and blood was spilled. The representative model of democracy as we know it is for Keane the result of many and different power conflicts, many of them bitterly fought in opposition to ruling groups, whether they were church hierarchies, landowners or imperial monarchies, often in the name of \\"the people\\". The concept of the sovereign \\"people\\" was one of the most contested in this second phase. The bitter controversies over who \\"the people\\" were, along with the common belief of the time that good government was government by representatives, characterised this era of representative democracy, an era which also saw the birth of an abundance of democracy-related neologisms, such as social democracy, liberal democracy and Christian democracy. Often contrasted with monarchy, representative democracy was praised as a way of governing better by openly airing differences of opinion – not only among the represented themselves, but also between representatives and those whom they are supposed to represent while encouraging the rotation of leadership guided by merit. The third part of the book is dedicated to the evolution of democracy since 1945. In Keane's view, after World War II, democracy has entered a new phase, which he calls monitory democracy. He explains that during the first half of the twentieth century, the representative model faced its deepest crisis. Parliaments proved to be not strong enough to defend democracy from economic collapse and the rise of various forms of dictatorial and totalitarian rule. The system of representative democracy based purely on representation showed its limits and fragility; the use of mass communication media (the press, the radio, and cinema) helped populist leaders like Mussolini and Hitler to gain consensus and almost destroy democracy has it had been hitherto known. The crisis in fact culminated in total war (1939–1945) and 'near-destruction worldwide of democratic institutions and ways of life by the storms of mechanised war, dictatorship and totalitarian rule'. After World War II, alongside parliamentary politics (typical of the representative model), \\"many different kinds of extra-parliamentary, power-scrutinising mechanisms\\" emerged. Keane calls these mechanisms \\"monitory bodies\\"; they function both from within the state and cross-borders. The emergence of monitory bodies have transformative effects on the core institutions of representative democracy: nation states are still important, but power-holders (representatives) are subject increasingly to unprecedented scrutiny from within and across borders, and outside the conventional mechanism of periodic elections and parliamentary representation. Since 1945, we have witnessed 'the birth of nearly one hundred new types of power-scrutinising institutions unknown to previous democrats'. Among these are public integrity commissions, judicial review procedures, parliaments for minorities, public interest litigation, citizens' assemblies (to name just a few); and international level (forums, summits, regional parliaments, human rights watch organisations, etc.). Since 1945 \\"power- monitoring and power-controlling devices have begun to extend sideways and downwards through the whole political order. They penetrate the corridors of government and occupy the nooks and crannies of civil society, and in so doing they greatly complicate, and sometimes wrong-foot, the lives of politicians, parties, legislatures and governments\\". These mechanisms of power scrutiny tend to make power relations both within and outside government more accountable and more democratic. Keane points out that democracy is no longer simply a way of handling the power of elected governments by electoral, parliamentary and constitutional means, and no longer a matter confined to territorial states. The central grip of elections, political parties and parliaments on citizens' lives is weakening and democracy is coming to mean more than elections, although nothing less. Within and outside states, independent monitors of power begin to have tangible effects. By putting politicians, parties and elected governments permanently on their toes, they complicate their lives, question their authority and force them to change their agendas– and sometimes smother them in disgrace. Some examples of these extra-parliamentary power-monitoring institutions have already been given. Others include public integrity commissions, judicial activism, local courts, workplace tribunals, consensus conferences, parliaments for minorities, public interest litigation, citizens' juries, citizens' assemblies, independent public inquiries, think-tanks, experts' reports, participatory budgeting, vigils, 'blogging' and other novel forms of media scrutiny. Historically speaking, due to its intricate network of institutions and inner dynamics, Keane considers monitory democracy to be the most complex form of democracy ever. He emphasises that its fruitful evolution is not to be taken for granted. Democracy is in a continuous state of flux. According to the book, democracy is not a done deal or something accomplished but still an unfinished experiment that \\"thrives on imperfection\\".  Reception  Since its first publication in Britain (June 2009 – in Australia was published July 2009, United States August 2008, and Portugal and Brazil Nov/Dec. 2009) the book has been reviewed by some of the major newspapers and reviews worldwide. On average it has attracted good reviews. Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review and wrote Keane's \\"study's broad sweep, wealth of detailed knowledge, shrewd insights and fluent, lively prose make it a must-read for scholars and citizens alike\\" Publishers Weekly, The Life and Death of Democracy by John Keane\\" 22 June 2009 Read original review here The Times of London columnist David Aaronovitch wrote that Keane's book was a good guide to the politics of the present. \\"What a difference a book can make. I had been as confused as any other observers about these events\\" – wrote Aaronovitch in May 2009 referring to the bewildering weeks in the recent history of British democracy, namely, the expense claims scandal surrounding Westminster. \\"Respectable women call BBC Radio 4 programmes to talk about how they would like to \\"string up\\" their elected representatives; headlines and commentators seem to compete for the most apocalyptic way of describing a crisis in governance …\\" How to make sense of all this? I was \\"thrashing around attempting to catch their meaning - and then I read John Keane's The Life and Death of Democracy …. Contained in this massive book was, among many, many other things, the analytical tool that told me why such a period as we have been living through was more or less inevitable. This instrument is Keane's diagnosis that for 50 years - largely unanalysed - a new form of democracy has been superseding the representative democracy that, formally, operates in most of the world.\\" And moreover: \\"That Keane, in a book covering the entire history of democracy, as well as a substantial speculation about its future, should so precisely capture the background to such a local scandal is a measure of the brilliance of his accomplishment. He says himself that this is the first such history to be attempted in more than a century, and we can only be grateful that it was Keane - an Australian-born academic and author, and the biographer of Tom Paine - who has filled the growing gap.\\" In Summer 2009, The Life and Death of Democracy was selected by the Times among the best history books for 'your holiday reading'. The London paper called the book 'the publishing event of the summer'The Times Online, 27 June 2009 Read the article here The Daily Telegraph ranked The Life and Death of Democracy alongside must-take holiday items, like women's electric shavers.The Telegraph, 31 July 2009, Read the article here Ben Wilson from the pages of the Literary Review wrote: It has become something of a fashion to write 'biographies' of inanimate things and ideas: fighter planes, football clubs, numbers, scientific theories, and so on. Despite its title, this is no such thing; rather, it is about the lives and deaths of many different forms of human government, sometimes within very short time periods. Keane's approach is evident from the beginning of this impressive work. […] Keane experiments with a number of voices, from the polemical to the analytical, and from ironic detachment to involved, lyrical narratives. There are jokes, and in one chapter he takes the guise of a future female historian writing of the first decade of the twenty-first century. His aim is to carry the reader through a long and sometimes complex history, and I think he succeeds.\\" Ben Wilson, \\"Power to the People - The Life and Death of Democracy\\" in Literary Review, June 2009, pp. 36-37 David Runciman from the pages of The Observer writes that Keane's book \\"is a remarkable book, nearly 1,000 pages long and with something to be learnt from almost every one of them. Still,\\" Runcimans adds \\"it's longer than it needs to be. Keane has travelled widely and thought deeply about his subject, but his repeated insistence on the originality of what he's doing starts to grate after a while.\\" Sunil Khilnani from the pages of the Financial Times wrote that \\"Keane successfully expands our sense of democracy's origins, deftly traces its global reach, and rightly insists on the contingent, historical character of democracy, its emergence and evolution through unintended moves that have enabled its continual reinvention. So sweeping a study must necessarily stand on others' shoulders but here Keane is slack. He fails to provide adequate footnotes for ideas, specific examples and phrases.\\" Sunil Khilnani, The Life and Death of Democracy, The Financial Times 20 June 2009 Read the article here In August Keane's book featured among the books recommended by the Daily Beast, the news reporting and opinion website published by Tina Brown, former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker The Daily Beast 18 August 2009 Read the article here Stephen Barber's (Social Europe Journal, August 2009) wrote: \\"This is an extraordinary book which tells us almost as much about the future of our democracy as it does about the past and the present.

Indeed, it may be the first attempt at a comprehensive survey of \\"democracy\\" in well over a century. To describe it as \\"comprehensive\\" is no idle gesture. One reason for its 1000-page length is that he has illuminating discussions of societies ranging across time and space from the ancient Near East and Athens—one of his important theses is that we overestimate the \\"invention of democracy\\" by Athens by ignoring evidence of the significance of \\"assemblies\\" in the Near East well before the Greeks—to contemporary developments in Asia, Africa and Latin America as well as more predictable discussions of Europe and North America.Sanford Levinson, The History Book Club, August 2009, Read the article here During June and July 2009 the book occupied the number 1 spot in Amazon's bestseller list for books on democracy in Political Science & Ideology section and in the History section.
