He graduated from the Fine Arts Institute in Baghdad in 1953, before completing his studies in 1957 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome, Italy.

He joined Al-Ruwad (The Pioneers), Iraq's first art group, formed by Iraqi painter, Faiq Hassan in the 1930s; the Jama‚Äôet Baghdad lil Fen al-Hadith (Baghdad Group for Modern Art) in 1953 and the Al-Zawiya Group (The Angle or The Corners) in 1967.Floyd, T.

The Pioneers group rejected the artificial atmosphere of the artist‚Äôs studio and encouraged artists to engage with the local landscape and traditional Iraqi life.Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.,\\" Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad, Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9 The Baghdad Modern Art Group wanted to connect modern art with traditional art of the 13th-century (in the manner of the Baghdad School). The philosophy behind Iraq's early art groups was the desire to connect Iraq's ancient art traditions with international trends in a way that contributed to a truly national Iraqi visual language. Ghani adopted this philosophy by consciously including Assyrian and Babylonian architectural detail, geometric patterns (Arabesque) and Arabic calligraphy in his sculptures.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 75 In so doing, artists, like Ghani, helped to synthesise heritage and modernity and to reassert a sense of national identity.Shabout, N., \\"Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism,\\" in Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online; Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan, Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30 Nasb al-Hurriyah (Monument of Freedom), Baghdad, a sculpture designed by Jawad Saleem and completed by Mohammed Ghani Hikmat in 1961 Between 1959 and 1961, Ghani worked as an assistant to his friend, sculptor, Jawad Saleem, on the project to erect the Nasb al-Hurriyah (Monument of Freedom) in Baghdad's Liberation Square (pictured). Ghani's role was to cast the bronze figures for the monument.

Many of Ghani's early sculptures were inspired by Iraqi folklore, especially characters from One Thousand and One Nights (widely known as the Tales of Arabian Nights). His early works were figurative and included statues of Sinbad, the Sailor; the 10th-century poet, Al-Mutanabbi; the first Abassid Caliph, Abu-Ja'afar Mansur (in stone); Hammurabi (in bronze) and Gilgamesh.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 72 As he matured, his work became increasingly abstract, but he never lost sight of the need to reference Iraq's ancient art traditions through the use of Arabic script, geometric designs, and Sumerian architectural features.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, pp 73-75 During the 1980s, he completed one of the gates of the UNICEF building in Paris; the mural of the Great Arab Revolt in Amman and five different works in Bahrain, including a mural in an old mosque, large statues and fountains.\\"As the Municipality of Baghdad Opens the Monument of the Magic Lantern of the Artist Mohamed Ghani Hikmat\\",Akhbaar Organisation, 26 December, 2011 Online: (translated from Arabic) During the 2003 war, and the overthrow of the Ba'ath government, Ghani left Baghdad for Amman in Jordan, where he continued to work.McGhee, A., \\"Young Journalists in an Industry Under Siege,\\" Meanjin Papers, Vol. 74, No. 3, pp 17-28 Several years later, following his return to Baghdad, he discovered the Museum of Modern Art in ruins.

The occupying forces insisted on a voluntary return of stolen artworks, a stance which resulted in very few works being returned. A few independent galleries purchased artworks with a view to returning them once a suitable national museum could be established but progress recovering the cultural assets was slow.King, E.A. and Levin, G., Ethics and the Visual Arts, Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 109 In around 2007, Ghani established a committee, the members of which included many respected Iraqi artists, with the objective of recovering stolen artworks.Shabout, N., \\"The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003,\\" in: Elaine A.

By 2010, some 1,500 of the most important works had been returned, and Ghani's committee was directly responsible for recovering 150 of the more important works. In addition, the statue, Motherhood by Jawad Saleem, stolen from Ghani's own studio, was returned.King, E.A. and Levin, G., Ethics and the Visual Arts, Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 109 In media interviews, Ghani often recalled how he was humbled by the generosity of members of the public, who approached him on the streets of Baghdad, wanting to return artworks which they had held in their possession for safekeeping. In one instance, a stranger offered to return two of Ghani's own sculptures which had been purchased on the black market, hoping that one day they would be returned to the Museum.McGhee, A., \\"Young Journalists in an Industry Under Siege,\\" Meanjin Papers, Vol. 74, No. 3, pp 17-28 Nosob Inqath Al Iraq (Saving Iraqi Culture) by Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, c. 2000 In 2010, the Mayor of Baghdad commissioned Ghani to complete a series of monuments for the city.

She was the beautiful daughter of the royal vizier who volunteered to wed the murderous King Shahryar, who would take a different bride to bed each night, and have them executed before the following dawn. Scheherazade devised an ingenious plan to stave off her execution. Each night she would relate a story that enthralled the King, but she failed to reveal the story's climax until dawn, thus delaying her execution. Through her actions, and after 1001 nights, she was able to transform the King into a more gentle soul.Claassens, L.J.M., Claiming Her Dignity: Female Resistance in the Old Testament, Liturgical Press, 2016, p. 137 Ghani's statue (pictured) shows her narrating a story to the reclining King.Goode, E., \\"Visiting Scheherazade in Baghdad,\\" New York Times, 27 August, 2008 Online: * Kahramana (pictured) depicts a slave girl, Marjana (or Morgiana), who persuaded thieves, who had come to attack her master, to hide in storage jars.

Construction The kontra can be constructed new, but is most often classical viola which has undergone several organological changes, for example, thinning (\\"regraduating\\") the top, back, and sides to increase the amplitude, and flattening the bridge, which allows the player to sound all three strings at once in order to produce chords. In addition, unlike the viola, they are only strung with three strings. Tuning The kontra is tuned like a viola, though lacking its low c string: g ‚Äì d' ‚Äì a' and frequently the a' string is replaced with a second g string tuned to a, a major second above the g, in a form of re-entrant tuning. Technique Due to the flattened bridge, the standard method of play is to play double stops and three-note chords and let the fiddle play melody lines.  Ensemble playing  The kontra has a defined role within dance band music. Its range lies between that of the fiddle or Vioara cu goarnƒÉ on the high-end and the double bass on the low-end.

He went to the Stationers' Company's School in London and then to the Imperial College of Science and Technology, also in London, from which he earned a bachelor's degree 1933, a PhD and diploma in 1940, and a D.Sc. in 1956. While studying for his PhD, Williams taught at Imperial College from 1933 to 1936, and at Sir John Cass Technical College from 1936 to 1940. During World War II, he served in the Royal Artillery, Royal Army Ordnance Corps, and Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He enlisted as a private (neglecting to inform the military about his degrees) but eventually reached the rank of major. After the war, he became a lecturer at Bedford College for Women, where he stayed from 1946 to 1951. He then moved to the University of Southampton, where he was professor of botany and head of the department of botany from 1951 to 1965. In 1965, Williams' former Southampton colleague Godfrey Lance invited him to visit the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Canberra, Australia. A year later, Williams moved to CSIRO himself, at the same time becoming an Australian citizen. He worked in CSIRO's Division of Computing Research in Canberra from 1966 to 1968, and then transferred to the Division of Tropical Pastures in Brisbane, where he worked from 1968 to 1973. Williams retired from CSIRO in 1973, at which point he moved from Brisbane to Townsville. During his retirement he continued to work as a consultant for several institutions. Research Williams' early work was on plant physiology, and more specifically on leaf expansion and the function of the Stomata. However, while at Southampton he became interested in more mathematical and statistical research topics such as the spatial distribution of plants. At the same time, he began writing software for his statistical analysis, using the Ferranti Pegasus computer then available at Southampton's computer centre. The centre's director, Godfrey Lance, was later to become a regular research collaborator of Williams. Williams' most heavily cited research work, with Lance, makes the observation that five different hierarchical clustering strategies then in use could all be related to each other: all five use formulas for the distance between clusters that vary only in the weights of certain numerical coefficients. This unification allowed the coefficients to be chosen based on their effect on the overall clustering rather than, as had been done before, selecting the clustering strategy on an ad hoc basis.. Williams and Lance also introduced the Canberra distance, a form of Manhattan distance between pairs of points normalised by dividing by the total Manhattan distance of the points from the origin. The normalisation makes this distance measure particularly suited for data sets in which some data values may significantly differ from the rest.. Recognizing the general applicability of these methods, Williams went on at CSIRO to apply them to problems other than plant taxonomy, as well as to the classification of angiosperms and grasses. In this work, he viewed numerical taxonomy as a form of exploratory data analysis, intended more to generate new hypotheses than to confirm them. Other activities Williams was an avid composer of mathematical puzzles; for instance, he wrote the cross-figure puzzle \\"The Little Pigley Farm\\" (also known as Dog's Mead, Little Pigley, Little Piggly Farm, Little Pigsby, Pilgrims' Plot, or Dog Days) which he first published in 1935 in The Strand Magazine... Long a self-taught piano player, Williams took lessons after moving to Australia, earned a credential, and taught piano himself. He also organised the first North Queensland Piano Competition. Awards and honours In 1973, the University of Queensland awarded Williams an honorary doctorate. He was elected as a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1978, and in 1980 he became an officer of the Order of the British Empire.

In 1988, 49 different songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 53 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. Only four songs spent more than a single week at number one in 1988: \\"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\\" by Kathy Mattea, \\"I Told You So\\" by Randy Travis, \\"I'll Leave This World Loving You\\" by Ricky Van Shelton and \\"When You Say Nothing at All\\" by Keith Whitley. Travis and Shelton each scored two other number ones during the year to give them a total of four weeks in the top spot. This figure was matched by Rosanne Cash, who achieved three solo number ones and one in collaboration with her then-husband Rodney Crowell, making her the only artist to take four different songs to number one in 1988. Highway 101, Restless Heart, George Strait and Tanya Tucker each topped the chart with three different songs. Artists to achieve their first chart-topper in 1988 included Dwight Yoakam, who reached number one with \\"Streets of Bakersfield\\", performed as a duet with Buck Owens, who had himself had a hit with the song fifteen years earlier. The song marked the veteran singer's first appearance at number one since 1972. The Desert Rose Band achieved the first of its two number ones with \\"He's Back and I'm Blue\\", and Paul Overstreet made his first appearance at number one when he collaborated with Tanya Tucker and Paul Davis on \\"I Won't Take Less Than Your Love\\". Overstreet achieved intermittent success as a singer but is better known as a songwriter, having written hit songs for many artists. At the other end of the scale, Merle Haggard topped the chart for the 38th and final time with \\"Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star\\". At the time of Haggard's death in 2016, only Conway Twitty (40) and George Strait (44) had taken more songs to the top of the Hot Country chart since Billboard began compiling sales and airplay into a single listing in 1958. Whitley's \\"When You Say Nothing at All\\" was the final number one of the year. Whitley was at the peak of his commercial success at the time, but would die less than six months later, on May 9, 1989.

In 1986, 52 different songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. No song managed more than a single week at number one during the year. The first number one of the year was \\"Have Mercy\\" by mother-daughter duo the Judds. In the fall, Conway Twitty achieved his 40th and final Hot Country number one with \\"Desperado Love\\", 18 years after he first topped the chart with \\"Next in Line\\". Twitty's total of 40 number ones would remain a record for the highest number of country chart- toppers by an artist until 2006, when the record was broken by George Strait. Two female acts tied for the most number ones of the year, each reaching the top spot three times: the Forester Sisters (including one in collaboration with the Bellamy Brothers) and the Judds. More than a dozen acts each achieved two number ones, including Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris, who each achieved one solo number one as well as performing together on the hit \\"Makin' Up for Lost Time (The Dallas Lovers' Song)\\". One of Juice Newton's two number ones, \\"Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)\\", a duet with Eddie Rabbitt, had originally been performed by Gloria Loring and Carl Anderson on the soap opera Days of Our Lives the previous year. The song was not initially released commercially, but after Newton and Rabbitt's version became a hit, Loring and Anderson's recording was released and topped the Hot Adult Contemporary chart, meaning that versions of the same song by two different acts were number ones in their respective genres within a month of each other. Acts to top the country chart for the first time in 1986 included Randy Travis with \\"On the Other Hand\\". Upon its initial release, the song had failed to even break into the top 40, but after Travis reached the top 10 with the song \\"1982\\", \\"On the Other Hand\\" was re-released and this time went all the way to number one, giving Travis his first chart-topper. Later in the year, T. Graham Brown achieved his first number one with \\"Hell and High Water\\", and the band Restless Heart reached the top of the chart for the first time with \\"That Rock Won't Roll\\", one of four chart-topping singles to be taken from the album Wheels. Hank Williams Jr. ended the year in the top spot with his version of \\"Mind Your Own Business\\", a song originally recorded by his father Hank Williams in 1949.

In 1984, 50 different singles topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. Six acts tied for the most number ones in 1984, with three each: bands Alabama and Exile and soloists Earl Thomas Conley, Merle Haggard, Ricky Skaggs and George Strait. One of the only two songs to spend more than a single week at number one was a collaboration between Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson. Iglesias had been successful in his native Spain and other Latin markets since the late 1960s, but his 1984 album 1100 Bel Air Place was his United States breakthrough. The album featured duets with American singers from a range of genres, and the first single to be taken from it, \\"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\\", paired Iglesias with veteran country singer Nelson. The song was a top 10 hit on the all-genres Billboard Hot 100 but went all the way to number one on the country chart. The only other multi-week chart-topper in 1984 was \\"Why Not Me\\" by mother-daughter duo The Judds, which ended the year at number one. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band had its first number one in 1984. The band had been active since the 1960s and released a number of acclaimed albums in the 1970s before shortening its name to simply Dirt Band and taking a mainstream pop music approach. Soon after reverting to its original name and switching back to country music, the band finally achieved its first Hot Country chart-topper with \\"Long Hard Road (The Sharecropper's Dream)\\". Another act to reach number one for the first time in 1984 after a lengthy chart career was Eddy Raven, who claimed the top spot in June with \\"I Got Mexico\\", more than ten years after his first appearance on the Hot Country Singles chart in early 1974. He would go on to have a total of six number one singles before his success tailed off in the late 1980s. Exile also topped the country chart for the first time in 1984; the band had topped the Hot 100 six years earlier for four weeks with the disco-influenced pop track \\"Kiss You All Over\\", but went on to achieve much greater success after a shift to the country genre in the early 1980s.

A concrete bridge was constructed in 1954, about 200 feet northwest of the covered bridge and the older structure was then bypassed by highway traffic. The bridge was severely damaged by floods in 1997 and 1998 and engineers determined a location about 400 feet east of the original site would be better for the bridge's chances of survival. The bridge was reconstructed in 2002. The bridge construction is a combination of Queen post and King post type truss. The sides are completely enclosed and the exterior is painted white. It is 75 feet in length, has a horizontal clearance of 14 feet, and a vertical clearance of 13 feet and six inches. The bridge is built of poplar and rests atop two stone abutments. There are a number of explanations for covered bridge construction. Most consider that the boarded sides and shingled roof protected the bridge floor and sub-structure from deterioration. It is also said that horses crossed covered bridges more easily without being able to see the streams underneath them.

In 1983, 50 different releases topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. One of only two singles to spend more than one week at number one in 1983 was \\"Islands in the Stream\\", a collaboration between two of country's leading solo singers, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. The song was a considerable crossover success, also topping the Adult Contemporary chart and reaching number one on the all-genres Billboard Hot 100. In 2005 the song topped a poll run by country music television channel CMT of the best country duets of all time. The only other multi-week number one was \\"Houston (Means I'm One Day Closer to You)\\" by Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers, which ended the year in the top spot. Five acts tied for the most number ones of the year, with three each, including Alabama, Crystal Gayle and John Anderson. Mickey Gilley achieved two solo number ones and also teamed with Charly McClain on the chart-topping duet \\"Paradise Tonight\\" and Merle Haggard similarly gained two solo number ones and spent a week at the top with \\"Pancho and Lefty\\", a collaboration with Willie Nelson. In addition to the artists who achieved three number ones, Kenny Rogers also spent three weeks at the top, as his two weeks in collaboration with Dolly Parton followed a week spent at number one with \\"We've Got Tonight\\", a duet with Sheena Easton. Male-female duets had long been a staple of country music, and a fourth such song to top the Hot Country chart in 1983 was \\"Faking Love\\" by T. G. Sheppard and Karen Brooks. In January Reba McEntire topped the chart for the first time with \\"Can't Even Get the Blues\\". McEntire would go on to become one of the most successful female singers in country music history, topping the chart regularly for nearly three decades; in 2011 she achieved her 25th number one song, tying with Dolly Parton for the most chart-topping songs by a female artist. While McEntire began a decades-long run of number ones in 1983, several veteran singers added to their extensive tallies of chart-toppers during the year; Merle Haggard's three number ones took his career total to 32 spanning 17 years, and Ronnie Milsap continued a run of number ones which had begun in 1974 and included 13 appearances in the top spot between 1980 and 1984.

IFES Voter turnout was reported to be 69.6%, a record low for a general election. Polling precincts opened 7:00 a.m. and closed at 3:00 p.m. The Cambodian Minister of Information, Khieu Kanharith announced in preliminary results that the Cambodian People's Party won 68 seats and the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party won all the remaining 55 seats. This election marked the largest seat loss by the Cambodian People's Party to date, and their lowest share of seats since 1998. Background The previous general elections in 2008 were won by the Cambodian People's Party, which managed to secure an absolute majority of the seats: 90 out of 123. Despite winning a parliamentary majority, the CPP chose to form a coalition with the royalist FUNCINPEC, which won 2 seats. The opposition Sam Rainsy Party and Human Rights Party won a combined total of 29 seats. In 2012, the two parties merged to form the Cambodian National Rescue Party. However, party leader Sam Rainsy was barred from running as a candidate because he was not registered to vote.Cambodia‚Äôs Election Panel Rejects Sam Rainsy Request to Contest Polls Radio Free Asia, 22 July 2013 The voter roll was finalised on 31 December 2012, at which time Rainsy was living abroad after being controversially convicted in 2010 of making changes to a map to suggest the country was losing land to neighbouring Vietnam.Opposition leader Sam Rainsy returns to Cambodia BBC News, 19 July 2013 Rainsy returned to Cambodia in July 2013 after he received a royal pardon from King Norodom Sihamoni, but Rainsy failed to have his name reinstated on the voter roll and was not eligible for candidacy in the election. Debates Cambodia had its first televised debate on 20 and 21 July. The US-funded National Democratic Institute also sponsored nine town hall-style debates with provincial candidates from almost all parties. IFES Conduct =Voting eligibility issues= National Assembly president Heng Samrin at a polling station in Kampong Cham province. Since Cambodia had had no official population count for the last five years, the country's population figure is merely guesswork, which has led to incorrect projections of possible voters ‚Äì making it difficult for the National Election Commission to ascertain the number of actual voters that should be listed in Cambodia's voting rolls. The lack of actual population count could have led to fraudulent voting, such as voters voting in multiple precincts using different names. According to the opposition CNRP, between 1.2 and 1.3 million names were omitted from voting rolls. Princess Norodom Arunrasmy poses for a photo after casting her vote. Migrant Vietnamese have also allegedly been able to register as voters due to lax identification policies in Cambodia. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party played up this anti-Vietnamese rhetoric in campaigning leading up to the election. =Indelible ink= One of the controversies that beset the Cambodian election before it even began was the use of an ostensibly indelible ink that was used to mark which voters had already voted. The ink had previously been donated by the Indian Embassy in Cambodia. Documentation by poll monitors before the election demonstrated the ink could simply be washed off using bleach or lime juice in minutes upon drying. The ink used could have perhaps allowed voters to vote more than once. Results The ruling CPP party received 48.83% of the votes, earned 68 seats, while the CNRP party won 55 seats with 44.46% of the vote. By losing 22 seats from the previous election, the CPP earned the fewest percentage of seats that it has had in the National Assembly since 1998. Other parties, including the Funcinpec Party and League for Democracy Party combined for 0 seats on 6.3% of the vote.COMFREL Reactions The CPP claimed victory in the election. The E.U. and U.S. expressed concern about possible irregularities, with the latter's State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki saying that \\"we call for a transparent and full investigation of all credible reports of irregularities. We urge all parties and their supporters to continue to act in an orderly and peaceful manner in the post-election period.\\" Vietnam congratulated Cambodia on the success of its 5th General Elections.http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/tt_baochi/pbnfn/ns130803160846 Remarks by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Luong Thanh Nghi on Cambodia‚Äôs general election French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott sent their letter of endorsement, congratulating Hun Sen on his election win. Aftermath Though there were claims that the election would be \\"worthless\\" even before voting started, after the election, there were complaints of election fraud. Sam Rainsy, the leader of the CNRP, declared that \\"We will not accept the result ‚Äì we cannot accept the result...The party in power cannot ignore us anymore.\\" The international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement that read that \\"the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) appears to have been involved in electoral fraud\\" and called for an \\"independent commission\\" to investigate \\"allegations of election fraud and other irregularities, including bias in the election machinery\\". Brad Adams, HRW's Asia Director, further stated that some of the fraud consisted of \\"senior ruling party officials appear to have been involved in issuing fake election documents and fraudulently registering voters in multiple provinces.\\" The Cambodian government denied calls by international organisations for an independent election review, while the government rejected calls for a review and the National Election Committee (NEC) denied irregularities. There were also claims of voter intimidation as the ruling party controlled the apparatus of state control. Thousands of CNRP supporters gathered in Phnom Penh in September to protest the results.

Hot Country Songs is a chart that ranks the top- performing country music songs in the United States, published by Billboard magazine. In 1980, 43 different singles topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. In the first issue of Billboard of 1980, Kenny Rogers moved into the number one position with \\"Coward of the County\\", his fifth consecutive country number one. The song went on to tie for the year's longest unbroken run at the top with Ronnie Milsap's double A-sided single \\"My Heart\\" / \\"Silent Night (After the Fight)\\" and \\"Lookin' for Love\\" by Johnny Lee. All three singles spent three consecutive weeks at number one. Rogers returned to the top of the country chart later in the year with \\"Lady\\", which was a crossover success, also reaching number one on Billboards all-genres chart, the Hot 100. Rogers was experiencing a lengthy spell of success with smooth sounds which appealed equally to country and pop audiences and established him as a major star in both genres. Milsap had the most country number ones of any artist in 1980, taking four different singles to the top spot, followed by Mickey Gilley with three. Milsap's total of six weeks at number one was the most achieved by an individual act. Cristy Lane reached number one for the first and only time in June with \\"One Day at a Time\\". Another first-time chart topper was the actor Clint Eastwood, who duetted with Merle Haggard on the song \\"Bar Room Buddies\\" for the soundtrack of his film Bronco Billy, in which Haggard made a cameo appearance. Eastwood had made occasional previous forays into music, including the full-length album Rawhide's Clint Eastwood Sings Cowboy Favorites in 1963, but \\"Bar Room Buddies\\" was his first ever Hot Country hit. Ronnie Milsap's number-one song \\"Cowboys and Clowns\\" also featured in Bronco Billy. A song from a film soundtrack also gave Johnny Lee his first number one in 1980, as \\"Lookin' for Love\\" was recorded for the film Urban Cowboy. Mickey Gilley's chart-topping version of \\"Stand by Me\\" was taken from the same film, in which Gilley himself appeared, as was \\"Could I Have This Dance\\" by Canadian country artist Anne Murray. The final artist to debut at number one in 1980 was Razzy Bailey with \\"Loving Up a Storm\\" in October. Johnny Lee's second chart-topper of the year, \\"One in a Million\\", was the final number one of the year.

Two of the most prominent exponents of the outlaw style, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson, collaborated on the longest-running number one of the year, \\"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\\", which spent four weeks atop the chart; each also reached number one individually.

Nelson was one of only two artists to take three different singles to number one during the year, as he also reached number one with his recordings of two pre-World War II songs, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" and \\"Blue Skies\\", taken from Stardust, an album on which he covered a range of pop standards. Kenny Rogers also achieved three number ones, as he topped the listing with \\"Love or Something Like It\\", \\"The Gambler\\" and \\"Every Time Two Fools Collide\\", a collaboration with Dottie West. Another artist linked to the outlaw movement who topped the chart in 1978 was Johnny Paycheck, who reached number one with \\"Take This Job and Shove It\\", which would go on to become his most successful and best-known song. The song, which topped the chart in Billboards first issue of the year, marked his first and only appearance at the top of the Hot Country chart. In May and June, two vocal groups which would both go on to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame reached number one for the first time: The Statler Brothers with \\"Do You Know You Are My Sunshine\\", and The Oak Ridge Boys with \\"I'll Be True to You\\". Margo Smith had her first number one in February with \\"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\\". She followed it up with another chart-topper in July with \\"It Only Hurts for a Little While\\", but these would prove to be her only number one singles. In April, Dottie West reached the top of the chart for the first time with her duet with Kenny Rogers. She would go on to achieve further number ones both in collaboration with Rogers and in her own right.

In 1977, 31 different singles topped the chart, which was at the time published under the title Hot Country Singles, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. Waylon Jennings spent the most weeks at number one, with eight, including a run of six weeks at the top with \\"Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)\\"; no single since 1967 had spent longer at number one. Crystal Gayle and Dolly Parton came closest to Jennings's total number of weeks at number one, each spending five weeks in the top spot. Parton's time at number one comprised a five-week run with \\"Here You Come Again\\", the second-longest running chart-topper of 1977, in the issues of Billboard dated December 3 through December 31. Conway Twitty was the only artist to take three different songs to the top of the chart. Thanks to the prevalence of crossover-friendly country pop, several country number ones of 1977 also charted highly on Billboards all-genres singles chart, the Hot 100, including Glen Campbell's \\"Southern Nights\\", which reached number one on the Hot 100 in the issue of Billboard dated April 30, the second time that Campbell had taken a song to the top of both charts. Crystal Gayle's \\"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\\" reached number 2 on the Hot 100 and Dolly Parton's \\"Here You Come Again\\" made number 3. In February, Welsh singer Tom Jones achieved his first country number one with \\"Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow\\". Previously associated mainly with the pop music field, albeit with some forays into country, Jones focused on the country music market when he returned to recording in the mid 1970s after concentrating in the early part of the decade on live stage shows in Las Vegas. He immediately topped the Hot Country chart with his very first entry and would achieve several more country hits over the next decade before moving back into the pop market. Father-daughter duo The Kendalls also topped the chart for the first time in 1977, spending four weeks atop the listing with \\"Heaven's Just a Sin Away\\"; although they had entered the chart several times previously, none of their earlier hits had even reached the top 50. Tammy Wynette, one of country music's best-known artists and biggest-selling female singers, topped the singles chart for the last time with \\"Near You\\", a duet with her former husband George Jones. The couple had divorced in 1975, but continued to release records together. Elvis Presley, the \\"king of rock 'n roll\\", topped the country chart with the last single released in his lifetime, when \\"Way Down\\" moved up to number one in the issue of Billboard dated August 20, four days after his death.

He served as the keyboardist, with Taro Hakase on violin and Yoshinobu Takeshita on bass. Their first eponymous album was released in September 1990 and sold 74,000 copies. Their second, Kryzler And Company #, sold over 81,000 copies. Steve McClure of Billboard wrote that they have become \\"Japan's unlikeliest pop idols, attracting hordes of screaming fans, a far cry from the decorum and reserve usually shown by Japan's classical music audiences.\\" One of the band's greatest claims to fame was providing the music for Celine Dion's single \\"To Love You More\\" which was recorded the theme song for the Japanese drama Koibito Yo (My Dear Lover). The song reached number one on Billboard Japan. The group produced 11 albums before going on hiatus as Hakase pursued a solo career. In February 2015, the group released a new album New World to commemorate their 25th anniversary.

In 1974, 41 different singles topped the chart, which at the time was published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores. At the start of the year, the number one song on the chart was \\"If We Make It Through December\\" by Merle Haggard, the song's third week in the top spot. Charlie Rich had the most number ones of 1974, taking five different songs to the top spot, followed by Dolly Parton, who had three solo chart- toppers and one in collaboration with her long-time mentor Porter Wagoner. Wagoner and Parton had charted with a number of duets since 1967, but \\"Please Don't Stop Loving Me\\" was their only number one as a duo. In 1973, Parton had taken the decision to end her working relationship with Wagoner, which served as the inspiration for the song \\"I Will Always Love You\\", one of her three solo number ones of 1974. In 1982 she re-recorded the song and it once again went to number one, making her the first artist to top the country chart with two different recordings of the same song. Wagoner and Parton's chart-topper was one of two male-female duets to reach number one in 1974, the other being Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn's \\"As Soon as I Hang Up the Phone\\". Twitty and Lynn had a run of success with duet recordings in the early 1970s alongside their ongoing solo careers. In addition to having the most individual chart- toppers, Charlie Rich also spent the highest total number of weeks at number one during the year. The singer nicknamed the \\"Silver Fox\\" spent eight weeks in the top spot with \\"There Won't Be Anymore\\", \\"A Very Special Love Song\\", \\"I Don't See Me in Your Eyes Anymore\\", \\"I Love My Friend\\" and \\"She Called Me Baby\\", all of which also crossed over to Billboard all-genre singles chart, the Hot 100; no other artist spent more than four weeks atop the country listing. A fifteen-year veteran of the music industry, Rich had finally achieved stardom in both the country and pop markets in the early 1970s and was at the peak of his success in 1974, but changing musical tastes and increasing personal problems led to him largely retiring at the end of the decade. In June, Ronnie Milsap had his first number one with \\"Pure Love\\". He would go on to become one of the most successful country performers of the 1970s and 1980s, topping the Hot Country Singles chart more than 30 times. In the same month, Waylon Jennings reached number one for the first time with \\"This Time\\". Jennings would go on to become one of the mainstays of the successful outlaw country movement of the late 1970s and, like Milsap, is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. A third future Hall of Fame inductee to top the chart for the first time in 1974 was Bobby Bare, who achieved the only number one of his lengthy career in July with \\"Marie Laveau\\". Mickey Gilley, Billy Swan, Melba Montgomery and Billy \\"Crash\\" Craddock were also first-time chart-toppers in 1974. The final number one of the year was \\"What a Man My Man Is\\" by Lynn Anderson.

In 1971, 21 different singles topped the chart, at the time published under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports supplied by stores. The first number one of the year was Lynn Anderson's \\"Rose Garden\\", which was in its second week at number one in the issue of Billboard dated January 2, and remained at the top for three further weeks before being displaced by \\"Flesh and Blood\\" by Johnny Cash. Charley Pride had the highest total number of weeks at number one in 1971, topping the chart for 11 weeks with \\"I'd Rather Love You\\", \\"I'm Just Me\\" and \\"Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'\\". Lynn Anderson and Sonny James also each had three number ones during the year, as did Conway Twitty, who reached the top of the chart with one solo single and two duets with Loretta Lynn. The two singers would go on to achieve a string of duet hits in the 1970s and 1980s. The longest unbroken run at number one in 1971 was achieved by Jerry Reed with \\"When You're Hot, You're Hot\\", which spent five consecutive weeks at number one during the summer. In the issue of Billboard dated February 6, Dolly Parton reached number one for the first time with the single \\"Joshua\\". Parton had risen to prominence when she began appearing alongside singer Porter Wagoner on his syndicated television show in 1967. She scored hits with duets with Wagoner as well as solo singles, and in 1971 achieved the first chart-topper of her career. She would go on to become the most successful female country performer of all time, as well as achieving considerable success in pop music and acting. \\"Joshua\\" was replaced in the top spot by another debut chart- topper for a female vocalist, \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\" by Sammi Smith, which was also a crossover hit, reaching the top 10 of Billboard all- genre singles chart, the Hot 100. Freddie Hart also achieved his first country number one in 1971. Hart had signed his first recording contract in 1953 and gained his first Hot Country hit in 1959, but had never reached the top 10 until \\"Easy Loving\\" went to number one in September 1971.

In 1970, 23 different singles topped the chart, which was published at this time under the title Hot Country Singles, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports supplied by stores. In the issue of Billboard dated January 3, 1970, \\"Baby, Baby (I Know You're a Lady)\\" by David Houston replaced the final chart-topper of 1969, Charley Pride's \\"(I'm So) Afraid of Losing You Again\\" at number one. Houston's single held the top spot until the January 31 issue, when it was replaced by Tom T. Hall's song \\"A Week in a Country Jail\\". Hall had achieved success as a songwriter, including penning the song \\"Harper Valley PTA\\" which had been both a pop and country number one for Jeannie C. Riley in 1968, but \\"A Week in a Country Jail\\" was his first number one as a performer. Hall also wrote \\"The Pool Shark\\", which gave Dave Dudley his one and only week at number one. Husband-and-wife duo Jack Blanchard & Misty Morgan also reached number one for the first and only time with \\"Tennessee Bird Walk\\". Lynn Anderson topped the chart for the first time with \\"Rose Garden\\", which was also a major crossover hit, reaching the top five of Billboards all-genres chart, the Hot 100. Hank Williams Jr., the son of one of the most influential country singers of all time, Hank Williams, achieved the first number one of a career which would go on to span more than fifty years when he collaborated with the Mike Curb Congregation on the single \\"All for the Love of Sunshine\\". Sonny James spent the most weeks at number one of any artist, his four chart-toppers totalling fourteen weeks in the top spot. \\"It's Just a Matter of Time\\", \\"My Love\\", \\"Don't Keep Me Hangin' On\\" and \\"Endlessly\\" formed part of a streak of sixteen consecutive number ones for James, which ran from 1967 until 1971. Three other artists took multiple singles to number one during 1970. Charley Pride had three chart-toppers totalling six weeks at number one, the highest total after the fourteen achieved by James, and Conway Twitty and Tammy Wynette each achieved two number ones. Twitty and his frequent duet partner Loretta Lynn both reached number one in 1970 with tracks which came to be regarded as their respective signature songs: \\"Hello Darlin'\\" and the autobiographical \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\". The final number one of the year was \\"Rose Garden\\" by Lynn Anderson, which began a run atop the chart in the issue of Billboard dated December 26 which would last until the issue dated January 30, 1971.

Roos (April 26, 1888 - October 6, 1964)Victor H. Roos' grave site in Omaha, Nebraska was an American entrepreneur and the founder or co-founder of several aircraft companies, including Cessna Aircraft.  Biography  The only Bellanca CF built, at the National Air and Space Museum An American Eaglet B-31 In 1917 Roos was a distributor of Harley Davidson pedal cycles in Omaha, Nebraska, becoming one of the largest distributors in the Midwest. In 1922, Roos and partner A.H. Fetters bought the aviation assets of the Maryland Pressed Steel Company and formed the Roos-Bellanca company (also known as the Omaha Aircraft Company) to build rising designer Giuseppe Bellanca's monoplane design, the CF. Only one example was built, but it became famous from its modern design, and publicity stunts such as holding in-flight weddings. The company dissolved in 1924. In September 1927, Travel Air founder Clyde Cessna split from Walter Beech forming Cessna-Roos aircraft. Roos became the second largest shareholder in the start-up venture that went on to produce the most popular general aviation aircraft in the world. Roos resigned just one month into the partnership, selling back his interest to Cessna, and the company changed its name to Cessna Aircraft in December 1927. In November 1927, the owner of the Swallow Airplane Company, Moellendick, became insolvent after sidelining Swallow production to make the Dallas Spirit on credit to enter the Dole Air Derby. Roos took control of the company, becoming the general manager, then left in 1928. In 1928 Roos joined the American Eagle aircraft company, which produced more Bellanca designed aircraft. Roos and partners agreed to merge with Lincoln-Page Aircraft Company, becoming the American Eagle-Lincoln Aircraft based at Fairfax Airport in Kansas City, Missouri, where he became president. When the company dissolved during the depression, Roos founded the short lived Victor H. Roos Aircraft Company to continue to sell the American Eaglet design. With Roos's permission, Ben Howard built his famous air racer \\"Mr. Mulligan\\" at the factory site after production of the Eaglet had ceased. After World War II Roos founded the Automatic Coin Machine Company in Kansas City to distribute jukebox machines.

Nhialdiu is in Leek Nuer country. Civil war The village is at a strategic junction of dirt roads. Between June 1997 and November 1998 fighting between factions in the Nhialdiu area caused about 70% of the population to flee to Bentiu and Mankien. In early 1998 villages around Nhialdiu were looted and destroyed. The health center in Nhialdiu was destroyed. Between July and August 2000 during fighting between militias a large band of country between Nimne and Nhialdiu was depopulated and burned to the ground. Many attacks were reported on villages around Nhialdiu in January‚ÄìApril 2002. A study of Landsat data between 1999 and 2004 showed major shifts in land use that closely corresponded to reports of fighting in Block 5A. Between 1999 and 2002 most farming activity stopped in the bands that extended on each side of the newly built oil roads. Traditional farming areas were abandoned and there was a gradual drift of farming activity towards the south and west. By 2002 there was no sign of any farming activity around Nhialdiu, where a series of village attacks were reported for the last three years. Post war Sporadic security problems continued after the end of the civil war in January 2005. On 23 March 2005 Leek Nuer raiders attacked cattle camps around Nhialdiu killing twenty people and taking 24,000 head of cattle. 6,000-10,000 civilians took refuge in Nhialdiu. The Bul launched a counterattack on the Leek, causing more civilians to flee to Nhialdiu, Bentiu and Rubkona. In January 2007 the vice-president of the Government of South Sudan visited the village. That week there was small-scale spear fighting in Pakcur and Nhialdiu in which five people were wounded in revenge for a killing that had taken place three months before. In August 2011 a public bus with 12 passengers hit landmines when travelling from Bentiu to Nhialdiu. Two people died and six were injured. The government suspected that a militia linked to Gai Yoach had planted the mines. As of January 2010 the Primary Health Care Center at Nhialdiu was partially equipped, and was being staffed by qualified nurses. The center was short of supplies of vaccines and medicines.

The French army paused in its retreat toward the Rhine River to savage the pursuing Austrians. The action occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. Biberach an der Riss is located southwest of Ulm. During the summer of 1796, the two armies of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan in the north and Moreau in the south advanced into southern Germany. They were opposed by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen who oversaw two Austrian armies under Latour and Wilhelm von Wartensleben. At the Battle of Amberg on 24 August 1796, Charles and Wartensleben combined to throw superior strength against Jourdan while Moreau was separated from his colleague. After Jourdan was beaten again at the Battle of W√ºrzburg on 3 September, Moreau was forced to abandon southern Bavaria to avoid being cut off from France. As the outnumbered Latour doggedly followed the French retreat, Moreau lashed out at him at Biberach. For a loss of 500 soldiers killed and wounded, Moreau's troops inflicted 300 killed and wounded on their enemies and captured 4,000 prisoners, 18 artillery pieces, and two colors. After the engagement, Latour followed the French at a more respectful distance. The next action was the Battle of Emmendingen on 19 October.

Spaulding supported the idea for the first U.S. currency not backed by gold or silver, thus helping to keep the Union economy afloat during the Civil War. Sidway's siblings were: Harold Spaulding Sidway (b. 1868), who married Mary Chase, Edith Sidway (1872-1958), who married William Allen Gardner (1869-1941), Clarence Spaulding Sidway (1877-1953), who married Genevieve Clark Hingston (1880-1939), and Ralph Huntington Sidway (1884-1936), who married Stephana Ostrom (Barnum) Sidway (1882-1962). Sidway attended Phillips Exeter Academy then Harvard University, graduating in 1893. After Harvard, he attended University at Buffalo Law School, graduating in 1894. Career After Harvard, he worked in the American Exchange Bank and the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Buffalo. After graduating from Law School, he studied with the law firm of Lewis, Moot & Lewis, until his admission to the bar in 1894. After being admitted to the bar, he practiced in the office of Sprague, Moot, Sprague & Brownell until 1897. In 1897, he left Sprague, Moot, Sprague & Brownell and went out on his own, establishing his own practice focusing primarily on real estate. As an attorney, he was responsible for all Sidway family interests in Buffalo, including the management of the Sidway building at Main and Goodell Streets. =Military career= March 1, 1894, he was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Seventy-fourth infantry regiment of the New York National Guard. On December 15, 1898, also his 29th birthday, he was commissioned a captain of the 202nd New York Volunteer Infantry and set sail for Cuba as part of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. His regiment was the first body of United States troops to enter Cuba where he served throughout the campaign. In 1902, he resigned from the regiment. In 1917, fourteen years after he resigned, he was again commissioned major of the depot battalion of the Seventy-fourth. On December 6, 1917, when the United States entered World War I, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of that regiment and led in organizing the command that took the place of the regular regiment after its departure for a mobilization camp. Personal life Elbridge G. Spaulding's boathouse on his \\"River Lawn\\" estate on Grand Island, New YorkOn April 16, 1903, Sidway married Amelia Minirva Roberts (1881-1972), the daughter of James A. Roberts, former comptroller of the state of New York. They lived at 37 Oakland Place in Buffalo, and together, they had three daughters: * Margaret St. John Sidway, who married James Kent Averill (living in Norfolk, Virginia in 1938) * Edith Sidway, who married Stevan I. Stevens (living in New York City in 1938) * Martha Sidway, who married Roger K. Adams (living in Buffalo, New York in 1938) He served as department commander of the United Spanish War Veterans and a member of the Naval and Military Order of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In Buffalo, he served as president the Main Street Association, Inc. (1936-1937), president of the Buildings Manufacturers Association (1926-1927), vice-president of the Robertson Cataract Electric Company, and was chairman of the Erie County Republican Committee from 1909‚Äì1910. He was also a member of the Buffalo Club, Saturn Club and the Ellicott Club of Buffalo, a life member of the Buffalo Library, the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, and the Buffalo Historical Society. Sidway died in Buffalo on January 17, 1938. He is interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery. =Boathouse= In the late 1930s, Sidway moved the now-NRHP listed Spaulding-Sidway Boathouse in Grand Island, New York about 270 feet northwest to his property in order to save the boathouse from demolition when the Spaulding estate was acquired in order to become Beaver Island State Park.

It contains approximately 1,170 gravemarkers dating from 1786 to 1964.This cemetery is the oldest cemetery in Fayetteville. After the Civil War ended, the Ladies' Memorial Association of Fayetteville had all soldiers who had been killed in battle--along with those who had died and been buried in various nearby locations--interred (or re-interred) in Cross Creek Cemetery. The group then raised the funds to erect a Confederate Soldiers Monument in Cross Creek, the first Confederate monument in North Carolina; it was dedicated on December 30, 1868. In 1915, the Cross Creek Cemetery Commission was created via an act of the North Carolina General Assembly, providing for the maintenance of the cemetery.

It existed during the Frasnian age of the Late Devonian epoch (around 385.3 to 374.5 mya). Discovery Specimens from at least 22 individuals of Laccognathus embryi were recovered from the Fram Formation of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada from 2000 to 2008 in the Nunavut Paleontological Expeditions. The expeditions were led by Jason P. Downs, Edward Daeschler, Farish Jenkins Jr., and Neil Shubin, and previously resulted in the discovery of the tetrapodomorph Tiktaalik roseae from the same locality. Ellesmere Island was also the site of previous Norwegian scientific expeditions by the ship Fram in 1893-1896 by Fridtjof Nansen and in 1898‚Äì1902 by Otto Sverdrup. In the second expedition, a few vertebrate fossils were collected from Ellesmere Island by a member of Sverdrup's crew, the geologist Per Schei. The collection included a few porolepiform scales attributed to Glyptolepis and Holoptychius. Prior to its discovery, the genus Laccognathus was known only from Latvia and Russia. L. embryi is the first member of the genus discovered in North America. The fossil sarcopterygian fish Laccognathus embryi of the Devonian was named in honour of Geologist Ashton F. Embry. Description Comparison of an average adult human male, , with the approximate length of L. embryi, 1.8 m (6 ft). Like other members of the genus, Laccognathus embryi possessed three deep longitudinal pits (fossae) on the external surface of the lower jaw. They are believed to have functioned as sensory pits able to detect changes in surrounding water pressure, similar to the lateral line of modern fishes and sharks, an analog to our ears. It had a distinctly dorsoventrally flattened short and wide head, less than one-fifth of the length of the body and with a width-to-length ratio of approximately 2:1. The eyes are very small, even smaller than those of L. panderi. The jaws possessed coronoid fangs up to in length. These are bordered with marginal teeth, with the exception of coronoids 1 and 2. Much of the external surface of the lower jaw is oriented downwards, suggesting that the animal spent a considerable amount of time resting on the substrate. L. embryi is estimated to have been 1.8 m (6 ft) long with a wide flattened body. Though only two partial specimens of the postcranial body have been recovered, L. embryi are believed to have the same body form as other species of Laccognathus. L. grossi, for example, had wide and relatively short pectoral and pelvic fins arising from fleshy lobes. The caudal (tail) fin was heterocercal, with a long low upper (epichordal) blade and a rounded lower (hypochordal) blade three times as wide as the upper blade. The dorsal and anal fins were positioned close to the caudal fin. The body was also covered in broadly overlapping thick scales, each roughly 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter and ornamented at the exposed ends with small radially arranged tubercles, ridges, or both. Distribution and geologic time range Laccognathus embryi was recovered in the middle part of the Fram Formation, designated as the NV2K17 locality. The formation, which consists of alternating layers of siltstone and sandstone, is dated to the Frasnian age of the Late Devonian epoch (around 385.3 ¬± 2.6 to 374.5 ¬± 2.6 mya). Specific palynological examination reveals that the NV2K17 locality itself is from the early to middle Frasnian. The area is believed to have been the floodplain of a meandering river system. The variety of fossils found in Ellesmere Island is similar to those found in the Gauja Formations of Latvia and Estonia, from whence other species of Laccognathus were recovered. North America and western Eurasia were once part of the ancient supercontinent of Euramerica (also known as Laurussia) located at the equator during the Devonian period. Paleoecology The flattened head of Laccognathus embryi indicates that it was a benthic sit-and-wait ambush predator. There are fossils of at least eight other vertebrate taxa found within the same fossiliferous zone as L. embryi, including Asterolepis, several large tetrapodomorphs, dipnoans, and another small undescribed holoptychiid. Though the locality in Ellesmere island is from freshwater siltstone alluvial deposits, the existence of other members of the genus in marine and estuarine deposits in Europe suggest that Laccognathus species could tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and salinity levels. Taxonomy Laccognathus embryi belongs to the genus Laccognathus, of the family Holoptychiidae. This family, in turn, belongs to the extinct order Porolepiformes, of the class Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes). Together with their closest living relatives, subclass Dipnoi (lungfishes), Laccognathus are members of the clade Dipnomorpha. Unlike its sister group, the Tetrapodomorpha, dipnomorphs were not direct ancestors of land vertebrates. The generic name Laccognathus is derived from Greek ŒªŒ¨Œ∫Œ∫ŒøœÇ (lakkos, 'pit') and Œ≥ŒΩŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ (gnathos, 'jaw') in reference to the three wide pits along the labial surface of the lower jaw. The specific name is in honour of Ashton Embry of the Geological Survey of Canada. See also *Ashton F.

Wendland, and the Robert Wendland case, the Supreme Court of California unanimously ruled that Rose Wendland, the wife of Robert Wendland, in the absence of a durable power of attorney for health care (DPAHC), did not have the authority to withhold artificial nutrition and hydration in her husband's behalf. The Court recognized that patients unable to make a decision for themselves should receive special protection according to the right to life and right to privacy provided by the California constitution. Background In 1993, Robert Wendland became permanently physically and mentally disabled after being severely injured in an automobile accident. After spending 16 months in a coma, Robert Wendland emerged with severe cognitive impairment, being unable to \\"swallow, control his bowels or bladder, communicate verbally or nonverbally, or act volitionally,\\" but he was able to react to simple commands with much repetitive coaching. Robert's wife and children also believed that he was unable to recognize them. Two years later, after being informed by Robert's physicians that Robert had no reasonable chance of improvement, his wife, Rose, and children requested that Robert's physicians to remove the feeding tube and allow Robert to die. According to Rose and Robert's brother, who had both spoken to Robert before his accident about living on life support or being kept alive through a feeding tube, Robert would not have wanted to live under those conditions. This decision was challenged by Robert's estranged mother, Florence, who sued Rose in order to prevent the removal of the feeding tube from her son, and the lawsuit lasted for six years until the decision by the California Supreme Court in 2001. The Court's decision The trial court held that the conservator, Rose Wendland, had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that removing the feeding tube would have been what Robert Wendland wanted or that it would have been in his best interest. The Court of Appeal for the Third District reversed; the California Supreme Court reversed, upholding the trial court. A previous California case had held that a conservator could withhold artificial nutrition and hydration from a patient in a persistent vegetative state; the Wendland court saw that situation as significantly different from that of a patient who is conscious but incompetent, because the latter might perceive the effects of starvation and dehydration. The Court also distinguished between an agent designated by the patient and a conservator appointed by a court; the former could be assumed to reliably represent the patient's wishes, but the same could not necessarily be assumed for the latter. [Section references are to the California Probate Code] Because of this‚Äîand because of the serious consequences of the decision‚Äîthe Court required the high standard of proof from a conservator in order to protect a person's right to life and right to privacy provided by Article I, Section 1 of the California constitution. The Court noted that the majority of health-care decisions require only preponderance of the evidence, the normal standard in civil cases. On several occasions, Robert had allegedly told Rose and others that he would not want to live like a \\"vegetable\\". The trial court concluded that these statements did not rise to clear and convincing evidence; the Supreme Court agreed. Law professor Lawrence Nelson, counsel for Rose Wendland, believed that these statements did provide a preponderance of the evidence, and suggested that had Robert given Rose power of attorney for health care, the Court would have respected Rose's decision to remove Robert's feeding tube. The Court did not address the requirements when there is no advance directive, agent, surrogate, or conservator. An article in the Western Journal of Medicine discussed this situation, and the two authors disagreed on the required standard of proof. Attorney Jon Eisenberg, who submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of Rose and Robert Wendland, believed that the Court plainly intended its opinion to apply narrowly to the question before it, so that in such circumstances, physicians may withdraw life-sustaining treatment at the direction of family or friends who can show by preponderance of the evidence that this would coincide with the patient's wishes. But Eisenberg's co-author, law professor Clark Kelso, believed that the opinion's reasoning compels the conclusion that clear and convincing evidence is required.

These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create a hierarchy of clusters of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm can be used for include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest- neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances. The main idea of the algorithm is to find pairs of clusters to merge by following paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest neighbors of each other, and the algorithm chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to merge. In order to save work by re-using as much as possible of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. By following paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that always find and merge the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, it always generates the same hierarchy of clusters. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm constructs a clustering in time proportional to the square of the number of points to be clustered. This is also proportional to the size of its input, when the input is provided in the form of an explicit distance matrix. The algorithm uses an amount of memory proportional to the number of points, when it is used for clustering methods such as Ward's method that allow constant-time calculation of the distance between clusters. However, for some other clustering methods it uses a larger amount of memory in an auxiliary data structure with which it keeps track of the distances between pairs of clusters. Background A hierarchical clustering of six points. The points to be clustered are at the top of the diagram, and the nodes below them represent clusters. Many problems in data analysis concern clustering, grouping data items into clusters of closely related items. Hierarchical clustering is a version of cluster analysis in which the clusters form a hierarchy or tree-like structure rather than a strict partition of the data items. In some cases, this type of clustering may be performed as a way of performing cluster analysis at multiple different scales simultaneously. In others, the data to be analyzed naturally has an unknown tree structure and the goal is to recover that structure by performing the analysis. Both of these kinds of analysis can be seen, for instance, in the application of hierarchical clustering to biological taxonomy. In this application, different living things are grouped into clusters at different scales or levels of similarity (species, genus, family, etc). This analysis simultaneously gives a multi-scale grouping of the organisms of the present age, and aims to accurately reconstruct the branching process or evolutionary tree that in past ages produced these organisms.. The input to a clustering problem consists of a set of points. A cluster is any proper subset of the points, and a hierarchical clustering is a maximal family of clusters with the property that any two clusters in the family are either nested or disjoint. Alternatively, a hierarchical clustering may be represented as a binary tree with the points at its leaves; the clusters of the clustering are the sets of points in subtrees descending from each node of the tree.. In agglomerative clustering methods, the input also includes a distance function defined on the points, or a numerical measure of their dissimilarity. The distance or dissimilarity should be symmetric: the distance between two points does not depend on which of them is considered first. However, unlike the distances in a metric space, it is not required to satisfy the triangle inequality. Next, the dissimilarity function is extended from pairs of points to pairs of clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, the distance between two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters. The bottleneck of this greedy algorithm is the subproblem of finding which two clusters to merge in each step. Known methods for repeatedly finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space to maintain a data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair... The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller amount of time and space than the greedy algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be guaranteed to come up with the same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order. The algorithm Animation of the algorithm using Ward's distance. Black dots are points, grey regions are larger clusters, blue arrows point to nearest neighbors, and the red bar indicates the current chain. For visual simplicity, when a merge leaves the chain empty, it continues with the recently merged cluster. Intuitively, the nearest neighbor chain algorithm repeatedly follows a chain of clusters where each cluster is the nearest neighbor of the previous one, until reaching a pair of clusters that are mutual nearest neighbors.. In more detail, the algorithm performs the following steps:. *Initialize the set of active clusters to consist of one- point clusters, one for each input point. *Let be a stack data structure, initially empty, the elements of which will be active clusters. *While there is more than one cluster in the set of clusters: **If is empty, choose an active cluster arbitrarily and push it onto . **Let be the active cluster on the top of . Compute the distances from to all other clusters, and let be the nearest other cluster. **If is already in , it must be the immediate predecessor of . Pop both clusters from and merge them. **Otherwise, if is not already in , push it onto . When it is possible for one cluster to have multiple equal nearest neighbors, then the algorithm requires a consistent tie-breaking rule. For instance, one may assign arbitrary index numbers to all of the clusters, and then select (among the equal nearest neighbors) the one with the smallest index number. This rule prevents certain kinds of inconsistent behavior in the algorithm; for instance, without such a rule, the neighboring cluster might occur earlier in the stack than as the predecessor of .For this tie-breaking rule, and an example of how tie-breaking is needed to prevent cycles in the nearest neighbor graph, see . Time and space analysis Each iteration of the loop performs a single search for the nearest neighbor of a cluster, and either adds one cluster to the stack or removes two clusters from it. Every cluster is only ever added once to the stack, because when it is removed again it is immediately made inactive and merged. There are a total of clusters that ever get added to the stack: single-point clusters in the initial set, and internal nodes other than the root in the binary tree representing the clustering. Therefore, the algorithm performs pushing iterations and popping iterations. Each of these iterations may spend time scanning as many as inter-cluster distances to find the nearest neighbor. The total number of distance calculations it makes is therefore less than . For the same reason, the total time used by the algorithm outside of these distance calculations is . Since the only data structure is the set of active clusters and the stack containing a subset of the active clusters, the space required is linear in the number of input points. Correctness For the algorithm to be correct, it must be the case that popping and merging the top two clusters from the algorithm's stack preserves the property that the remaining clusters on the stack form a chain of nearest neighbors. Additionally, it should be the case that all of the clusters produced during the algorithm are the same as the clusters produced by a greedy algorithm that always merges the closest two clusters, even though the greedy algorithm will in general perform its merges in a different order than the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm. Both of these properties depend on the specific choice of how to measure the distance between clusters. The correctness of this algorithm relies on a property of its distance function called reducibility. This property was identified by in connection with an earlier clustering method that used mutual nearest neighbor pairs but not chains of nearest neighbors.. A distance function on clusters is defined to be reducible if, for every three clusters , and in the greedy hierarchical clustering such that and are mutual nearest neighbors, the following inequality holds: :. If a distance function has the reducibility property, then merging two clusters and can only cause the nearest neighbor of to change if that nearest neighbor was one of and . This has two important consequences for the nearest neighbor chain algorithm. First, it can be shown using this property that, at each step of the algorithm, the clusters on the stack form a valid chain of nearest neighbors, because whenever a nearest neighbor becomes invalidated it is immediately removed from the stack. Second, and even more importantly, it follows from this property that, if two clusters and both belong to the greedy hierarchical clustering, and are mutual nearest neighbors at any point in time, then they will be merged by the greedy clustering, for they must remain mutual nearest neighbors until they are merged. It follows that each mutual nearest neighbor pair found by the nearest neighbor chain algorithm is also a pair of clusters found by the greedy algorithm, and therefore that the nearest neighbor chain algorithm computes exactly the same clustering (although in a different order) as the greedy algorithm. Application to specific clustering distances =Ward's method= Ward's method is an agglomerative clustering method in which the dissimilarity between two clusters and is measured by the amount by which merging the two clusters into a single larger cluster would increase the average squared distance of a point to its cluster centroid.. That is, :d(A,B)=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in A, y\\\\in B} \\\\frac{d^2(x,y)}{A+B} - \\\\sum_{x,y\\\\in A} \\\\frac{d^2(x,y)}{A} - \\\\sum_{x,y\\\\in B} \\\\frac{d^2(x,y)}{B}. Expressed in terms of the centroid c_A and cardinality n_A of the two clusters, it has the simpler formula :d(A,B)=\\\\frac{d^2(c_a,c_b)}{1/n_A + 1/n_B}, allowing it to be computed in constant time per distance calculation. Although highly sensitive to outliers, Ward's method is the most popular variation of agglomerative clustering both because of the round shape of the clusters it typically forms and because of its principled definition as the clustering that at each step has the smallest variance within its clusters.. Alternatively, this distance can be seen as the difference in k-means cost between the new cluster and the two old clusters. Ward's distance is also reducible, as can be seen more easily from a different formula for calculating the distance of a merged cluster from the distances of the clusters it was merged from:. :d(A\\\\cup B,C) = \\\\frac{n_A+n_C}{n_A+n_B+n_C} d(A,C) + \\\\frac{n_B+n_C}{n_A+n_B+n_C} d(B,C) - \\\\frac{n_C}{n_A+n_B+n_C} d(A,B). Distance update formulas such as this one are called formulas \\"of Lance‚ÄìWilliams type\\" after the work of . If d(A,B) is the smallest of the three distances on the right hand side (as would necessarily be true if A and B are mutual nearest-neighbors) then the negative contribution from its term is cancelled by the n_C coefficient of one of the two other terms, leaving a positive value added to the weighted average of the other two distances. Therefore, the combined distance is always at least as large as the minimum of d(A,C) and d(B,C), meeting the definition of reducibility. Because Ward's distance is reducible, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm using Ward's distance calculates exactly the same clustering as the standard greedy algorithm. For points in a Euclidean space of constant dimension, it takes time and space . =Complete linkage and average distance= Complete-linkage or furthest-neighbor clustering is a form of agglomerative clustering that defines the dissimilarity between clusters to be the maximum distance between any two points from the two clusters. Similarly, average-distance clustering uses the average pairwise distance as the dissimilarity. Like Ward's distance, these two forms of clustering obey a formula of Lance‚ÄìWilliams type. In complete linkage, the distance d(A\\\\cup B,C) is the maximum of the two distances d(A,C) and d(B,C). Therefore, it is at least equal to the minimum of these two distances, the requirement for being reducible. For average distance, d(A\\\\cup B,C) is just a weighted average of the distances d(A,C) and d(B,C). Again, this is at least as large as the minimum of the two distances. Thus, in both of these cases, the distance is reducible. Unlike Ward's method, these two forms of clustering do not have a constant-time method for computing distances between pairs of clusters. Instead it is possible to maintain an array of distances between all pairs of clusters. Whenever two clusters are merged, the formula can be used to compute the distance between the merged cluster and all other clusters. Maintaining this array over the course of the clustering algorithm takes time and space . The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm may be used in conjunction with this array of distances to find the same clustering as the greedy algorithm for these cases. Its total time and space, using this array, is also . The same time and space bounds can also be achieved in a different way, by a technique that overlays a quadtree-based priority queue data structure on top of the distance matrix and uses it to perform the standard greedy clustering algorithm. This quadtree method is more general, as it works even for clustering methods that are not reducible. However, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm matches its time and space bounds while using simpler data structures.. =Single linkage= In single-linkage or nearest-neighbor clustering, the oldest form of agglomerative hierarchical clustering, the dissimilarity between clusters is measured as the minimum distance between any two points from the two clusters. With this dissimilarity, :d(A\\\\cup B,C) = \\\\min(d(A,C),d(B,C)), meeting as an equality rather than an inequality the requirement of reducibility. (Single-linkage also obeys a Lance‚ÄìWilliams formula, but with a negative coefficient from which it is more difficult to prove reducibility.) As with complete linkage and average distance, the difficulty of calculating cluster distances causes the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm to take time and space to compute the single-linkage clustering. However, the single-linkage clustering can be found more efficiently by an alternative algorithm that computes the minimum spanning tree of the input distances using Prim's algorithm, and then sorts the minimum spanning tree edges and uses this sorted list to guide the merger of pairs of clusters. Within Prim's algorithm, each successive minimum spanning tree edge can be found by a sequential search through an unsorted list of the smallest edges connecting the partially constructed tree to each additional vertex. This choice saves the time that the algorithm would otherwise spend adjusting the weights of vertices in its priority queue. Using Prim's algorithm in this way would take time and space , matching the best bounds that could be achieved with the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm for distances with constant-time calculations.. =Centroid distance= Another distance measure commonly used in agglomerative clustering is the distance between the centroids of pairs of clusters, also known as the weighted group method. It can be calculated easily in constant time per distance calculation. However, it is not reducible. For instance, if the input forms the set of three points of an equilateral triangle, merging two of these points into a larger cluster causes the inter- cluster distance to decrease, a violation of reducibility. Therefore, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm will not necessarily find the same clustering as the greedy algorithm. Nevertheless, writes that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm provides \\"a good heuristic\\" for the centroid method. A different algorithm by can be used to find the greedy clustering in time for this distance measure. =Distances sensitive to merge order= The above presentation explicitly disallowed distances sensitive to merge order. Indeed, allowing such distances can cause problems. In particular, there exist order- sensitive cluster distances which satisfy reducibility, but for which the above algorithm will return a hierarchy with suboptimal costs. Therefore, when cluster distances are defined by a recursive formula (as some of the ones discussed above are), care must be taken that they do not use the hierarchy in a way which is sensitive to merge order.. History The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm was developed and implemented in 1982 by Jean-Paul Benz√©cri. and J. Juan.. They based this algorithm on earlier methods that constructed hierarchical clusterings using mutual nearest neighbor pairs without taking advantage of nearest neighbor chains..

At the 1998-99 Karnataka State Film Awards, the film won two awards; Best Art Direction (M. Ismail) and Best Sound Recording (S. Mahendran). It was reported that the core storyline and plot twists of Vishwaroopam is thematically similar to this movie. It was also reported that the climax of the movie Run Anthony vaguely reminds of Swasthik. Plot The movie starts in Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir, with woman photographer who is running away from a terror attack. She shows the army men the photos of one of the men leading the attack. The scene then shifts to Bangalore, where the militant arrives dressed in Hindu clothes and meets his Muslim parents. He is then attacked by them and is taken away to a hospital to treat his injuries, while his parents are arrested and jailed. The CBI chief visits them, who reveal that they could not bear to have a terrorist, who killed innocent people as their son, and that is why they attacked him. The CBI team then reaches the hospital where they find out the terrorist has escaped. In a slum in Bangalore a man named Guru, who looks like the terrorist lives with his family, which consists of his parents, sister and grandmother. He is arrested when the police mistake him for the terrorist. He is however repeatedly arrested because of the actions of the terrorist, i.e Guru's look-alike. It soon becomes clear however that Guru and the terrorist are one and the same. He then kidnaps the daughter of the Defence minister and his love interest, demanding the release of an imprisoned militant in exchange for her. He does this with the help of a man from his slum. He then cleverly convinces the police and the CBI that he and the terrorist are separate people. He then has his associate rig a projector at the drop zone and when the imprisoned militant is released, Guru goes after the jeep in which the imprisoned terrorist and his associate are in the excuse of catching it. As soon as his associate and the terrorist jump out, he drives the jeep towards a petrol pump. Guru jumps out just as the jeep hits the pump, causing a big explosion. The police seeing the pre arranged bodies in the jeep think both terrorists are dead. Elsewhere, Guru shaves off the forehead of the imprisoned terrorist. A swastika and some writings are revealed to be tattooed to his forehead. He then goes to the CBI chief. It is revealed that this was the plan of Guru and the CBI chief. By staging the attack in Baramulla, the woman photographer, who was actually a CBI agent would ensure that the establishment think he was a big time terrorist. This would be reinforced when his pretend parents the aged Muslim couple, also agents would stab and injure him, claiming not being able to bear to have a terrorist son. And by kidnapping the defence minister's daughter, he would be able to get the imprisoned militant. It is shown that the tattoos on the militant's head was the location of a cache of explosives. Guru would place fake bombs in their place, thus convincing the terrorist groups that he was their ally. Then they would not attack thinking Guru had done their job for them. While Guru is placing the fake bombs at Mysore palace, he is confronted by his love interest, the daughter of the defence minister, at gunpoint. Because she does not believe him, Guru denotes a bomb, planning to convince her of the truth. However it explodes, revealing it was a real bomb. Even though he is devastated by his actions, he regains his composure and escapes to his home where he tells his parents everything. However they attack and try to kill him. He escapes from there also and he goes to a secluded place. He faces the CBI chief who shoots Guru in both legs. He reveals to Guru that he is the son of a Major of the Indian Army, who along with his wife were killed by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. The people who he thought were his parents are revealed to be terrorists of Pakistani descent, who raised him along with their daughter. The CBI chief, who has connections with terror groups, plans an attack along with Guru's fake parents. He escapes with the help his neighbour Pinky, who takes him to her house to help bind his wounds. Angered by being betrayed by the people who he thought were his own, he places explosives on himself and goes to the Mysore palace, where he defuses some of the bombs he placed. However he is unable to prevent the explosions of the other bombs, which kill his adopted sister along with several people. The terrorist couple, who are devastated by the death of theirs daughter, and the CBI chief are berated by Guru, for killing innocent people in the name of country and religion. Guru's fake father kills the CBI chief when he orders one of his subordinates to kill Guru. He along with his wife and mother admit their mistakes and surrender to the police, revealing to the police that Guru is innocent.

Hare (1880-1967) was a native of New Zealand and explorer of Antarctica. He was part of the shore party at Hut Point in the Discovery Expedition of 1901-1903\\\\. In this service he narrowly escaped death on Ross Island on 11‚Äì13 March 1902. Antarctica Hare was born in December 1880 in Invercargill, the son of a banker. He began his adult life as a clerk, and was employed in this position in November 1901 when the RRS Discovery made landfall in his then-home, Lyttelton. The ship dismissed its wardroom assistant and steward in this port, and Hare, who had befriended ship's officer Reginald Ford, was signed on the spot to fill the vacancy on the ship's roster. He soon learned that this assignment meant that he would be the personal steward of the ship's captain, Robert Falcon Scott. As a ship's captain on a vessel unofficially but firmly run along Royal Navy lines, Scott was rated to have a personal servant. Hare kept his own journal and counsel, observing at one point that his captain was \\"over sensitive and got worked up if things did not go as planned.\\" Soon after the expedition landed on Ross Island in March 1902, Hare joined a sledging party who intended to probe the 80-km. length of the island, with their goal that of reaching the other end, Cape Crozier. Hare got physically lost on this icy journey and was in the field, without equipment to camp or build a fire, for forty-eight hours. Hare later confessed that, lonely and discouraged, he had sat down in the snow to die; his life had been saved by a sled dog, Kid, whom Hare (who had no Polar experience) had treated as a sort of pet dog. While this type of contact between humans and sled dogs is not generally recommended, it had encouraged Kid to become affectionate with the human, and in this crisis Kid revived the endangered explorer by licking his face. Eventually, although completely alone, Hare managed to orient himself and return to base. Hare remained at Hut Point during the winter of 1902, but returned to New Zealand in February 1903 aboard a relief ship, the Morning. He again signed on to the Discovery in June 1904 to accompany the captain from New Zealand to London. This was his final Antarctic service; he returned to his native land. The New Zealand Culture Ministry reports that in later life, the banker's son worked as a piano tuner. When he died in May 1967, he was the final survivor of the Discovery Expedition. =Legacy= Hare Peak, a summit of the system of mountains that surmounts the eastern side of the Leigh Hunt Glacier, was named after Hare in 1962. It is located on the Dufek Coast within the Ross Dependency, a section of Antarctica that is under the nominal suzerainty of Hare's homeland of New Zealand.

Bongino ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Republican in 2012, 2014, and 2016.  Professional career  = NYPD = Bongino worked for the New York City Police Department from 1995 to 1999. = Secret Service and book release = Bongino joined the United States Secret Service in 1999 as a special agent, leaving the New York Field Office in 2002 to become an instructor at the Secret Service Training Academy in Beltsville, Maryland. In 2006, he was assigned to the Presidential Protection Division during George W. Bush's second term. He remained on protective duty after Barack Obama became President, leaving in May 2011 to run for the U.S. Senate. Bongino's first book, Life Inside the Bubble, about his career as a Secret Service agent, was released in 2013. The book discusses his experiences protecting presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and investigating federal crimes along with his 2012 run for the U.S. Senate in Maryland. Bongino was criticized by former colleagues at the Secret Service for using his Secret Service background as part of his run for political office and for his claim of having secret information based on conversations he overheard in the Obama White House. A former colleague criticized him for trying to use his proximity to President Obama in his political career: \\"He's trying to draw attention to himself and he's hijacking the Secret Service brand. That's all he's got going for him.\\" Bongino said he had access to \\"high-level discussions\\" in the White House. Unnamed former colleagues said he \\"tends to exaggerate his importance on the presidential detail and exaggerate his proximity\\" and that \\"We don't sit in on meetings at the White House. We don't sit in on high-level meetings.\\" In response to the criticism from an anonymous former colleague, Bongino stated \\"There's nothing confidential in the book\\" and \\"It's not a tell-all. It's my tale of the Secret Service.\\" Bongino has rejected claims that Obama was born outside the United States. Bongino's second book, The Fight: A Secret Service Agent's Inside Account of Security Failings and the Political Machine was published in January 2016. = Media = Bongino has been a radio host and commentator on both local and national radio programs. He has been a guest host for both the Sean Hannity and Mark Levin radio shows and sometimes fills in on WMAL-FM talk radio in Washington, D.C. and WBAL in Baltimore. He was a paid contributor to NRATV, until December 2018. Bongino has frequently appeared on Fox News' opinion programming and on the conspiracy theory website InfoWars. He guest-hosted Hannity's Fox News show in December 2018. Bongino is a proponent of Spygate, a conspiracy theory alleging illegal spying on Donald Trump's 2016 campaign was perpetrated by Barack Obama's administration in his book Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump. In December 2019, Bongino launched an alternative to the Drudge Report known as the Bongino Report. Prior to the site's launch, he criticized Drudge for having \\"abandoned\\" Trump supporters. = Political views = In 2018, Bongino said of himself, \\"My entire life right now is about owning the libs. That's it.\\" He is a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. Bongino has called the investigation of the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections a \\"total scam,\\" and is a proponent of the Spygate conspiracy theory. In May 2018, Bongino was quoted by Trump in a tweet, as Bongino attacked former CIA Director John Brennan. Bongino was quoted as saying that Brennan \\"has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American's faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the top of the FBI.\\" Bongino was also quoted as alleging that Brennan was \\"worried about staying out of jail.\\" In May 2018, after Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy and some conservative legal experts challenged Trump's claims that the FBI had spied on his 2016 presidential campaign, Bongino claimed Gowdy had been \\"fooled\\" by the Department of Justice. In February 2019, Bongino accused Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein of attempting a coup against Trump. According to Mother Jones, Bongino is a member of Groundswell, a group of conservative activists working to advance conservative causes. In 2019, Bongino published Exonerated: The Failed Takedown of President Donald Trump by the Swamp. It was on The New York Times Best Seller list with an asterisk noting that the book benefited from bulk sales. In August 2020, Bongino denied that his book benefited from bulk sales, maintaining that the only event at which books were bought in bulk took place over a month after his book appeared on the list. In October 2020, Bongino published his third book, Follow the Money: The Shocking Deep State Connections of the Anti-Trump Cabal.  Political campaigns  = 2012 U.S. Senate election = Bongino ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Maryland in 2012. Former gubernatorial candidate Brian Murphy was his campaign chairman. Bongino won the Republican primary on April 3, 2012, with 33.8 percent of the vote, defeating nine other candidates.

Bongino lost to Delaney by two percentage points. While Bongino carried four of the district's five counties, he could not overcome a 20,500-vote deficit in the district's share of Montgomery County in the outer suburbs of Washington. = 2016 House of Representatives election = Bongino speaking at an event in February 2016 After moving to Florida in 2015, Bongino contemplated running for the United States Senate and Florida's 18th congressional district in 2016. However, in June 2016, Bongino declared that he would seek the Republican nomination for Florida's 19th congressional district. He faced Chauncey Goss, a Sanibel City Councilman who sought the seat in 2012, and Francis Rooney, a businessman and former United States Ambassador to the Holy See, in the primary. In an August 2016 interview with a Politico reporter, Bongino went on a profanity laced rant against the reporter, who asked about a story in the Naples Daily News that Bongino said was dishonest. The recorded phone call was published by Politico. He later explained that he was under stress due to his wife's illness and said that the reporter had goaded him. Bongino placed third in the August 2016 primary, losing the nomination to Rooney.  Personal life  Bongino was born in Queens, New York City. Bongino graduated from Archbishop Molloy High School. He attended Queens College in the city, where he earned both a bachelor's and master's degree in psychology, and Pennsylvania State University, where he earned a Master of Business Administration. Bongino is married to Paula Andrea, n√©e Martinez, who was born in Colombia. They have two daughters. In 2012, Bongino and his wife operated three businesses from their home, selling martial arts apparel, designing websites, and consulting on security and risk management. While running for office in 2016, Bongino resisted talking about his business interests and said he and his wife had shut them down. Having lived in Severna Park, Maryland, since 2002, Bongino moved to Palm City, Florida, in 2015. On September 23, 2020, Bongino announced that a seven-centimeter tumor had been found in his throat. Bongino added that he was unsure if the tumor was cancerous or benign, but would fly to New York on September 25 for further screening. On October 2, Bongino said that he received a \\"bad phone call\\" from doctors, and announced that he would be undergoing surgery on October 7. Following his surgery, Bongino tweeted that the \\"entire tumor\\" was removed from his neck, but that he very likely had lymphoma. He said that he would be receiving treatment in the future. On October 16, Bongino confirmed that he received an official diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, adding that he would be continuing treatment in consultation with his doctors.

Biography Prior to his election as Patriarch Zane had served the government of Venice. He had been ambassador or holder of similar office to Urbino, Portugal, Spain, Austria and the Ottoman Empire. In the case of the Ottoman Empire he held the office of Bailo in Constantinople, which was considered the key position in the Venetian foreign service. The bailo acted as both ambassador and consul, not only representing the political interests of Venice but seeking the protection and stability of Venice's merchants in Constantinople. He also supervised all other consuls of Venice throughout the Ottoman Empire. While serving as Bailo Zane expanded the number of consuls under his direction from nine to 10. Zane lacked the degree in either theology or canon law mandated by the Council of Trent. Negotiations by Venice got this requirement waived and managed to postpone Zane's examination on theology by the Pope and panel of cardinals, as required of all Italian bishops at that time, until 1601. Zane was able to pass the examination at that time. Sources *Mary Laven. Virgin's of Venice: Broken Vows and Cloistered Lives in the Renaissance Convent.

He performs live at all UNLV athletic events. The mascot, Hey Reb!, was first created in 1983 to depict the embodiment of an independent, rebel spirit at UNLV athletic events, intended as a tribute to western settlers. Previous mascots UNLV's original mascot was a Confederate uniform-wearing wolf named Beauregard. Beauregard was designed to contrast with the Wolf Pack's northern desert wolf mascot of the University of Nevada, Reno. Dressed in a grey uniform, Beauregard represented a \\"Johnny Reb\\" in defiance of UNR. In the 1970s, as race discrimination issues dominated national events, community members voiced concerns that Beauregard glorified the Confederacy and had little to do with the community's history. In the early 1970s, students had voted to banish Beauregard but retained the Rebels name, rejecting alternatives such as Big Horn Rams, Nuggets, A-Bombs, and Sand Burners. Replacing Beau was a musket- toting Minuteman, but that Revolutionary War figure failed to resonate in the West either. UNLV went without an official mascot for some time before Hey Reb was developed. Design Hey Reb was created as a replacement for Beauregard the wolf. In 1982, Miller was a partner in a local advertising firm and headed the UNLV account. When he heard of UNLV's search for a fitting symbol, he offered to sketch some ideas. He brainstormed about the kind of character that could embody the spirit of a Rebel while representing the community's history. His inspiration came from the mountain men of the 1800s. Hey Reb is always seen wearing a UNLV jersey with the number 57 on it, to commemorate the University's founding in the year 1957. In 2004, Hey Reb was named one of 12 All-American Mascots, and was given a chance to compete for the Capital One Bowl mascot of the year as part of the Capital One Mascot Challenge, finishing second in the online voting. Hey Reb has also been featured in two national commercials for ESPN's SportsCenter. In 2013, Hey Reb and Jon \\"Jersey\\" Goldman, the UNLV student who wears the costume to portray him, were featured in the Hulu documentary series Behind the Mask. The series followed four mascots, and the people who portrayed them, both inside and outside of the mascot costume. Criticism The campus community was divided over the contention that the mascot, looking like a Confederate soldier, still appeared to be a symbol of racism. In 2015, Nevada Senator Harry Reid called for the design to be revisited again. On June 16, 2020, amid protests of racial inequality related to the killing of George Floyd, UNLV announced they had removed the Hey Reb! statue in front of the Tam Alumni Center, stating: \\"In recent conversations with the donor we mutually agreed it was best to remove the statue and return it.\\" The University's president Marta Meana clarified the decision: \\"Over the past few months, I have had discussions with multiple individuals and stakeholder groups from campus and the community on how best the university can move forward given recent events throughout our nation\\".

The film was later acquired by and released on NETFLIX despite its continued ban by Censor Board of India. His Second film Brown is in production. Filmmaker and writer Unfreedom, a socio-political drama, is his first feature film. Set in New York and New Delhi, the film deals with issues of identity and violence. The film stars Victor Banerjee and Adil Hussain. In a recent interview, Victor Banerjee commended Raj Amit Kumar for his approach to sex and violence in this film, which were an essential part of the story and screenplay, even though he has usually condemned the vulgarity with which these are approached in mainstream cinema. National Film Awards winner Hari Nair is the cinematographer of the film. Academy Award winner Resul Pookutty has done the sound design and the original music score is by Filmfare Awards winner Wayne Sharpe and Jesse Kotansky.

He was the publisher and editor of the Pittsburgh Courier from 1910 until his death.  Biography  He was born in Ahoskie, North Carolina, the son of Lucy Peoples and an unknown father.Buni 1974, p. 4. He graduated as valedictorian of Waters Training School in Winton, North Carolina, in 1901, and attended Wayland Academy and Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, from 1901 to 1903. He then attended the University of Pittsburgh (then known as the Western University of Pennsylvania), and graduated from its law school in 1909. He passed the bar examination in 1909Buni 1974, p. 40. and married Jessie Matthews from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on February 17, 1919. Vann was one of only five black attorneys in Pittsburgh in 1910, a city with more than 25,000 African Americans. In early March 1910, Vann drew up incorporation papers for the Pittsburgh Courier and began writing contributions.Buni, p. 42. Through Vann's connections, the paper was able to attract wealthy investors, including Cumberland Willis Posey Sr..Buni, p. 43. On May 10, 1910, the Pittsburgh Courier was formally incorporated, with Vann handling the legal means.Buni, p. 44. During the summer, the paper grew from four to eight pages, but struggled with circulation and financial solvency due to a small market and lack of interested advertisers. In the fall of 1910, original founder Edwin Nathaniel Harleston left the paper for financial and creative reasons,Buni, p. 46. and Vann became editor. The Courier under Vann prominently featured Vann's work as a lawyer and public figure. As editor, Vann wrote editorials encouraging readers to only patronize business that paid for advertisements in the Courier and ran contests to attempt to increase circulation.Buni, p. 51. In his Christmas editorial at the end of 1914, Vann wrote of the paper's intent to \\"abolish every vestige of Jim Crowism in Pittsburgh.\\" Buni, p. 54. In the 1920s, Vann made efforts to improve the quality of the news included in the growing paper. Under Vann, the \\"Local News\\" section of the Courier covered the social lives of the upper- and middle-class members of the Hill District. This included accounts of vacations, marriages, and parties of prominent families and the goings on of local groups, such as the Pittsburgh Frogs. Vann legitimized the Courier with a professional staff, national advertisements, a dedicated printing plant, and wide circulation.Buni, pp. 133-134. Vann stirred up controversy and 10,000 new readers by hiring George Schuyler in 1925, whose editorials and opinions made him famous as the \\"black H.L. Mencken\\"Buni, pp. 136-140. (who was a Courier subscriber).Buni, p. 141. Under Vann, the Courier also worked as a tool for social progress. Most significantly, the paper extensively covered the injustices on African Americans perpetrated by the Pullman Company and supported the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.Buni, p. 163. Vann wrote to gain support for causes such as improved housing conditions in the Hill District, better education for black students, and equal employment and union opportunities.Buni, pp. 61-70. However, Vann often used his Courier editorials to publicly fight with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and W. E. B. Du Bois over issues such as President Calvin Coolidge's grants of clemency to black soldiers involved in the Houston RiotBuni, pp. 147-148. and Vann's allegations that James Weldon Johnson embezzled money for personal use from the NAACP and the Garland Fund.Buni, pp. 152-153. This disharmony was resolved in 1929 by published apologies by Vann, Du Bois, and Johnson, and within the decade, Du Bois became a regular Courier contributor.Buni, p. 160. But in 1938, Vann's Courier ended up at odds with the NAACP once again. Vann, through national campaigns and contact with President Franklin D. Roosevelt pursued inclusion of African- American units in the United States Armed Forces. Vann saw this as an achievable step on the path to integration of the military, but the NAACP leadership, primarily Walter White, publicly disagreed with this half-measure, despite the protests of Thurgood Marshall. As a result of the Courier‚Ä≤s influence and Vann's political clout, New York Congressman Fish successfully added an amendment prohibiting racial discrimination in selection and training of men drafted to the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940.Buni, pp. 305-312. In 1932, Vann officially put the Courier behind the party realignment of African Americans. He urged readers to vote for Democrats, writing, \\"My friends, go home and turn Lincoln's picture to the wall.\\" After achieving prominence as the head of the Courier, Vann served as Special Assistant to U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings from 1933 until 1935. Largely neglected and even ill-treated (staff stenographers often refused to take dictation from him because he was black),Buni 1974, p. 205. Vann could not get an appointment to see the Attorney General and in fact may never have met the man while in Washington.Buni 1974, p. 206. Vann resigned in 1935 to return to the Pittsburgh Courier; by 1938 the paper was the largest American black weekly, with a circulation of 250,000.

It was formed in 1977 under the Human Rights Act 1993. The Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People (He Purongo m≈ç te Uiuitanga m≈ç Aukatitanga e PƒÅngia ana e ngƒÅ TƒÅngata Whakawhitiira) was carried out in 2006, and reported on in 2008 (The Inquiry). Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in New Zealand enjoy the majority of the same rights as others. The exceptions to this are the right to adopt children as a couple and the right to marry. While New Zealand does not have anti-discrimination laws specific to transgender, the laws that do exist are thought to cover members of the trans communities. The Human Rights Act 1993 outlaws discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. The Report of the Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People was a world first by a national human rights institution and focused on three areas: trans people‚Äôs experience with health care access, everyday interactions and community participation. There is very little information about the number of trans people in New Zealand; and those numbers that do exist are suggested to significantly underestimate the size of the trans population. Terminology used The Inquiry recognised that both gender identity and its expression can vary significantly and as such, the report adopted ‚Äòtrans‚Äô as a generic term. Other terms that can be used include the following:Human Rights Commission, ‚ÄúReport of The Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People‚Äù (2008) at 12 * Whakawahine, Hinehi, Hinehua: MƒÅori terms for someone born with a male body who has a female gender identity * Tangata ira tane: a MƒÅori term for someone born with a female body who has a male gender identity. * Transgender: a person whose gender is different from their assigned gender at birth. * Genderqueer: people who do not conform to traditional gender norms. * Intersex: a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not seem to fit the typical biological definitions of male / female. Health Care Access It was found that trans people face difficulties when accessing the same general health services as other individuals. The three main difficulties presented were, firstly, gaps both in knowledge and services and, secondly, the cost. The third finding was the difficulty for trans people to be treated with dignity and respect throughout the process. The health care system was found to have ‚Äúmajor gaps in the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of medical services‚Äù.Human Rights Commission, ‚ÄúReport of The Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People‚Äù (2008) at 31 A lack of information creates barriers for trans people: without ‚Äòclear treatment pathways‚Äô, there is a significant gap in the current provision of health care for trans people. The Inquiry noted that there was a high degree of consistency between trans people and health professionals about the issues affecting trans people's access to health services. Quality of care is inherently reduced unless health professionals have access to information specific to trans people. Confusion and difficulties surrounding the cost of health care for trans people also presented significant challenges; while the cost of hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery varied, it was accepted that the cost is often prohibitive. The Inquiry suggests that the biggest gains for trans people in the short to medium term may be through better support in primary health care, and have subsequently begun discussions with the Ministry of Health. Socially =At School= A gender identity that is not congruent with one's body can lead to feelings of insecurity and vulnerability, one that can be exacerbated during youth. Trans children and young people are faced with the challenge of being dependent on others (such as parents, caregivers and teachers) to protect their human rights and to ensure that they have role models and support. While schools have a responsibility to provide a safe environment where students are able to learn, the Inquiry heard from stakeholder groups (such as the Council of Trade Unions and the Post-Primary Teachers‚Äô Association) ‚Äúwho noted the importance of initiative to improve the safety of trans students.Human Rights Commission, ‚ÄúReport of The Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People‚Äù (2008) at 42 =At Work= Employment was also an issue that was brought to the Inquiry. The key concerns were access to employment, job retention, workplace safety and promotion. ‚ÄúThe incidence of discrimination faced by trans people is high. Four out of five submissions described examples of discrimination that ranged from harassment at work to vicious assault and sexual abuse.‚Äù Human Rights Commission, ‚ÄúReport of The Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People‚Äù (2008) at 65 =At Home= Another common difficulty faced was regarding access to housing; trans people spoke about experiencing discrimination when looking at housing (most of this feedback was received in relation to renting). In addition to this, daily challenges included access to public toilets which often posed issues for trans people; while public places must be accessible to all who wish to use them, ensuring fair and manageable access to everyone requires a balance of interests. ‚ÄúInability to access public toilets had a major, daily impact.‚ÄùHuman Rights Commission, ‚ÄúReport of The Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People‚Äù (2008) at 39 Community Participation The Inquiry found that an issue for trans people often centres around official documentation; ‚Äúdocuments that accord with a trans person‚Äôs gender identity affirm their dignity and secure participation as equal citizens.‚Äù Human Rights Commission, ‚ÄúReport of The Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People‚Äù (2008) at 79 While a case has been submitted for trans people to be able to obtain documents that reflect their gender identity, the Inquiry states, ‚Äúthe process for changing sex details on official documents should be simplified to reflect the reality.‚ÄùHuman Rights Commission, ‚ÄúReport of The Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People‚Äù (2008) at 88 The Inquiry considers that the current law provides an adequate framework both for trans people to assert their rights to privacy of personal information and for agencies holding such information to respect these rights. However, inconsistencies in practice and the importance of these issues to trans people indicate that it would be useful to have resources that dealt specifically with how current laws apply to personal information about them. Recommendations * The Inquiry considers that trans people would have clearer legal protection from discrimination if section 21(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1993 should be amended to clearly state gender identity. * Enable effective participation by trans people in decisions that affect them * Reduce discrimination and marginalisation experienced by trans people * Improving trans people's access to public health services and developing treatment pathways and standards of care for gender reassignment services * Simplify the requirements for changing sex details on a birth certificate, a passport and other documents to ensure consistency with the HRA * Consider the specific human rights issues facing intersex people Conclusion of the Inquiry The implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Inquiry are necessary to ensure that trans people and their families enjoy the same rights as other people in New Zealand. ‚ÄúThe international human rights framework applies to everyone by virtue of their common humanity. Trans people are, therefore, entitled to respect for and protection and promotion of their human rights on the same basis as everyone else.‚Äù The HRC has a continuing role to play in implementing the Transgender Inquiry to galvanise the impetus for change that has been generated. The Commission's specific role includes providing human rights education on issues for trans people and facilitating dialogues. What has happened since the Inquiry? The focus is now on implementing the Inquiry's recommendations and other suggested actions. This requires work by the Human Rights Commission, government agencies, trans people and the wider community.

It lies about 25 km south-south-west of Denmark, Western Australia, near the track to the coast at Boat Harbour cove. The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it is supports small numbers of the endangered Australasian bittern. Description The shallow wetlands are permanent or near-permanent, cycling through seasonal changes in salinity from freshwater in winter and spring to brackish in summer and autumn. They provide habitat for the bitterns in the form of sedgelands dominated by Baumea articulata or Gahnia trifida, but also have heathland, shrubland and forest communities. The site is largely contained by the Owingup Nature Reserve and has a Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry summers.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Owingup Swamp and Boat Harbour Wetlands. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 13/09/2011. Flora and fauna Over fifty species of plants, over forty species of macroinvertebrates, and at least eight species of fish have been recorded in the area. The swamp supports the largest remaining mature stand of juniper myrtle (Taxandria juniperina) forest and a nearby wetland holds one of the largest known populations of the nationally threatened tall donkey orchid, Diuris drummondii. The swamp system is a nursery area for freshwater and estuarine fishes. =Birds= With the bitterns, some forty waterbird species have been recorded at the swamp, with another five in the surrounding wetlands. Of these, ten species breed in the area, including blue-billed ducks. Long-toed stints and Eurasian coots are known to use the swamp.

He is SNU distinguished professor in the School of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Seoul National University, director of Center for Nanoparticle Research of Institute for Basic Science (IBS), and an associate editor of the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Hyeon is recognized by his pioneering work in chemical synthesis of uniformly sized nanocrystals and various applications of functional nanomaterials. In 2011, he was listed as the 37th most cited chemist and the 19th in materials science among ‚ÄúTop 100 Chemists‚Äù of the decade by UNESCO&IUPAC.; He has published over 350 papers in prominent international journals with more than 70,000 citations and an h-index of 137. Since 2014, he has been listed as a Highly Cited Researcher in chemistry and materials science by Clarivate Analytics and became a Clarivate Citation Laureate in 2020.  Biography  Hyeon was born in Dalseong County, Daegu, South Korea. He received his B.A. degree in 1987 and M.S. in 1989 from Chemistry Department of Seoul National University, and Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1996 under the supervision of Kenneth S. Suslick. At Illinois Hyeon studied sonochemical synthesis of nanostructured catalytic and magnetic materials. From June 1996 to July 1997, he was a postdoctoral research associate in the Wolfgang M. H. Sachtler group at Northwestern University. He joined the faculty of the School of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Seoul National University in 1997.  Career  Hyeon is a leading scientist in the area of synthesis, assembly, and biomedical applications of uniformly sized nanoparticles. In particular, his research group developed a new generalized synthetic strategy, called ‚Äúheat-up process‚Äù, for producing uniform-sized nanoparticles of many transition metals and oxides without a size selection process. With this simple and inexpensive method, his group went on to design and fabricate multifunctional nanostructured materials for biomedical applications. Hyeon developed a new T1 MRI contrast agent using biocompatible manganese oxide (MnO) nanoparticles, exhibiting detailed anatomic structures of mouse brain. His group reported on the fabrication of monodisperse magnetite nanoparticles immobilized with uniform pore-sized mesoporous silica spheres for simultaneous MRI, fluorescence imaging, and drug delivery. The first demonstration of high- resolution in vivo three-photon imaging using biocompatible and bright Mn2+ doped ZnS nanocrystals was published in 2013. Uniformly sized iron oxide nanoclusters could be successfully used as T1 MR contrast agent for high- resolution MR angiography of macaque monkeys. His research interests also includes engineering the architecture of nanomaterials and utilizing them in lithium ion battery, fuel cell electrocatalysts, solar cells, and thermoelectrics. The group reported in 2013 the first demonstration of galvanic replacement reactions in metal oxide nanocrystals, and were able to synthesize hollow nanocrystals of various multimetallic oxides including Mn3O4/Œ≥-Fe2O3. (Ref) He has delivered more than 30 invited lectures in conferences sponsored by the Materials Research Society, American Chemical Society, and Gordon Research Conferences, and more than 20 invited lectures at UC-Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Cornell, and Columbia.

Upon their return, they opened the first Jivamukti Yoga Society in the East Village of New York City. In 1990 they began to practice Ashtanga Yoga with Pattabhi Jois in Mysore, India. In 1993, in upstate New York, they met yoga scholar and ashram founder Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati (Yogi Mishra). In 1998, having become \\"wildly successful\\", the yoga center moved to a studio on Lafayette Street; some 400 people subscribed, annual membership at that time costing $1200, rather more than a typical gym. Stefanie Syman ascribes Jivamukti's \\"surprisingly profitabile\\" business with its merger of \\"overt spirituality, the chanting, the deities, and the sacred music and vigorous asana classes\\" to the culture at that moment in history, comparable to America of the late 1910s and early 1920s. In 2000, Jivamukti opened a second center on the Upper East Side. In 2003, senior Jivamukti students Patrick Broome and Gabriela Bozic opened Jivamukti Munich, the first Jivamukti Yoga Center outside of New York City. In 2006, the Jivamukti Yoga School NYC relocated their main headquarters to an environmentally constructed studio in Union Square. Jivamukti Yoga has developed a reputation as the chosen yoga style of many celebrities. The name Jivamukti is an adaptation of the Sanskrit ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø jivanmuktih, where jiva is the individual living soul, and mukti ‚Äì like moksa ‚Äì is liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. Thus the Jivamukti method is \\"liberation while living\\".Sharon Gannon and David Life, Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul, New York: Ballantine Books, 2002, p. xvii. Main tenets There are five main tenets of the Jivamukti method. These are Shastra, Bhakti, Ahimsa, NƒÅda, and Dhyana. =Shastra= Shastra, or scripture, is the study and exploration of the four central texts of yoga and of the Sanskrit language in which they were written. The four texts are the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Upanishads. =Bhakti= Bhakti, \\"devotion to God\\", is the practice of devotion and humility. Jivamukti Yoga holds that \\"God-realization\\" is the goal of yoga practice, and that it does not matter to what form of God one's love and devotion is directed; what matters is that the devotion should be directed to something higher than one's own self or ego. =Ahimsa= Ahimsa is the practice of nonviolence, or non- harming. Ahimsa is informed by compassion, and is defined in Patanjali's Yoga Sutra as the first of five yamas. Yamas define the measure of how the yogi relates to other people and to the external world. The Jivamukti method teaches that the practice of ahimsa extends not only to other humans but to all animal life and advocates ethical vegetarianism both as a means of resolving human karma and as an environmental imperative for the future health of the planet. =NƒÅda= NƒÅda yoga centers on deep inner listening, chanting, and elevated music. Its theoretical and practical aspects are based on the premise that everything that exists, including human beings, consists of sound vibrations, called nƒÅda. Contrary to many other schools of yoga, Jivamukti teachers generally do not do the postures while they teach a class. This encourages students to learn by listening, rather than by watching, and in this way develop their ability to listen effectively. Sharon Gannon summarizes the intention of this approach as follows: ‚ÄúThrough listening, hearing arises, through hearing knowing, through knowing becoming, by becoming being is possible.‚Äù =Dhyana= Dhyana, or meditation, as taught in the Jivamukti method is the practice of being still and watching one's own mind think. This practice is intended to enable a person to cease to identify with their thoughts and realize that they are more than their thoughts. All Jivamukti Yoga classes include a meditation practice.

In 2003, the Jivamukti Yoga School NYC established a 125-acre nature preserve in the Catskill Mountains, near Woodstock, New York. Known as the Wild Woodstock Jivamukti Forest Sanctuary, it serves as the country ashram for the Jivamukti Yoga School and a safe haven and unpolluted habitat for diverse plant and animal species. To teach the Jivamukti Yoga method in one of its centers, an instructor is required to go through rigorous yoga teacher training and to pass a series of examinations.  Controversies  In 2016, accusations of sexual harassment were made public against one of Jivamukti Yoga School's most senior teachers, Ruth Lauer-Manenti, by one of her female students. The student filed a lawsuit, which has since been settled for an undisclosed amount. Author and blogger Michelle Goldberg questioned in Slate magazine whether Jivamukti is a workplace, an ashram, or a cult, with a culture of spiritual abuse and secrecy. Author and yoga teacher Matthew Remski reported, based on interviews with former employees of Jivamukti, that Jivamukti Yoga School NYC used non- disclosure agreements to \\"smooth over student grievances against teachers, or teacher‚Äôs [sic] grievances against management\\", and to prevent former students and employees from discussing the school‚Äôs culture. In exchange, Remski writes, departing personnel and students received cash payments or tuition refunds.

The genus was described in 2006 from Ypresian stage (Early Eocene) deposits of British Columbia, Canada. Almost all the specimens collected are queens, with an exception of a single fossilised worker. These ants are large, and the eyes are also large and well developed; a sting is present in one species. The behaviour of these ants may have been similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants, such as foraging solitarily for arthropod prey and never leaving pheromone trails to food sources. Avitomyrmex has not been assigned to any tribe, instead generally being regarded as incertae sedis within Myrmeciinae. However, its identity as an ant has been challenged, although it is undoubtedly a hymenopteran insect. History and classification All Avitomyrmex specimens were collected from the McAbee Fossil Beds, British Columbia Avitomyrmex is an extinct genus of ants with three described species. Fossils of Avitomyrmex, along with other extinct Myrmeciinae ants were first studied and described by Bruce Archibald, Stefan Cover and Corrie Moreau of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They published their 2006 description of the genus and species in an Annals of the Entomological Society of America journal article. The genus name is a combination of the Latin \\"avitus\\" meaning \\"ancient\\" or \\"grandfatherly\\" and the Greek myrmex, meaning \\"ant\\". Included with the genus description, the paper contained the description of Avitomyrmex mastax, Avitomyrmex systenus, and the type species Avitomyrmex elongatus. These fossil species date back to the Middle Ypresian. Archibald and colleagues originally classified Avitomyrmex as incertae sedis (Latin for \\"of uncertain placement\\") within the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, as the specimens are unable to be properly identified. In 2008, however, Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel, Switzerland, noted that no specimen in this genus allows a proper examination of the apomorphy (key diagnostic traits) of the subfamilial or familial characters. While Baroni Urbani excludes Avitomyrmex from Myrmeciinae and classifies it as incertae sedis in Hymenoptera, the morphological characters and wings show the specimens are undoubtedly a hymenopteran insect. A 2012 report by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky of the Moscow State University describing new myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald and colleagues without mentioning the comments of Baroni Urbani. The following cladograms generated by Archibald and colleagues show two possible phylogenetic positions of Avitomyrmex among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae; the cladogram on the right included three additional extinct genera compared to that on the left. It is suggested that Avitomyrmex may be closely related to other extinct Myrmeciinae ants such as Macabeemyrma and Ypresiomyrma, as well as the extant Nothomyrmecia macrops. { width=\\"100%\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\"   align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\" } Description There are several characters which separate Avitomyrmex from other ant genera. The most notable feature is the distinctly slender nature of the queens and workers morphology. This is shown clearly in the shape of the petiole connecting the thorax and the abdomen. While similar to the modern myrmeciine genus Nothomyrmecia of Southern Australia, the two genera are distinguishable by the structure of the petiole, with Avitomyrmex lacking the peduncle seen in Nothomyrmecia. The eyes are large and well developed, the mandibles are subtriangular but poorly preserved, and a sting is present on examined A. systenus fossils. As for A. elongatus and A. mastax, it is unknown if the two ants have a sting, due to either poor preservation or the sting has not been preserved at all. =A. elongatus= A. elongatus was described from a single side of a compression fossil found from the Middle Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds, Kamloops Group, near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The incomplete specimen of a queen, numbered 2003.2.8CDM032, is currently preserved in the paleontology collections housed at the Courtenay and District Museum, Courtenay, British Columbia. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau coined the specific epithet from the Latin \\"elongatus\\" meaning \\"prolonged\\" in reference to the elongated morphology of the type specimen. The species is discernible from the other two species of Avitomyrmex by its notably larger size, the preserved portion of the ant being over 20 millimetres (0.8 inches). The forewings are almost as large as the specimen, measuring around 18 millimetres (0.7 inches) while the hindwings are too poorly preserved to be studied. The holotype is preserved with a partly disarticulated gaster and is missing her head. =A. mastax= The second species described from the McAbee Fossil Beds is A. mastax which, unlike A. elongatus, is known from two specimens. The holotype and paratype are both included in the Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops collections as UCCIPRL-18 F-850 and UCCIPRL-18 F-929 respectively. The holotype specimen is a partial queen which is incomplete, with one forewing and the head fairly preserved, and the other isolated body portions indistinct. The paratype is a mostly complete queen missing parts of her gaster, legs and hind wings. Overall the species is estimated to have been 15 millimetres (0.6 inches) long and has a forewing length of 13 millimetres (0.5 inches). A. mastax is distinguishable from the other species in Avitomyrmex by its smaller mandible size, being less than half the length of the head with eight teeth, and additionally the shape of the head capsule. The specimen also has large compound eyes. The specific epithet mastax is from the Greek \\"mastax\\" meaning \\"jaw\\" or \\"mandible\\", a reference to the small size of the mandibles compared to the other species of Avitomyrmex. =A. systenus= Of the three described species of Avitomyrmex found at the McAbee Fossil Beds, only A. systenus is known from worker caste specimens. The holotype is currently deposited in the Courtenay and District Museum paleontology collections as 2003.2.11 CDM 035 while the paratype, UCCIPR L-18 F-989, and an additional hypotype worker, UCCIPR L-18 F-825, which is tentatively assigned to the species are both deposited in Thompson Rivers University collections. Based on the mostly complete workers, mature specimens are estimated to have been 15 millimetres (0.6 inches). Due to the size of adult workers they cannot be attributed to A. elongatus while the overall petiole, head capsule and mandible structure distinguish it from A. mastax. The eyes are large and one- third the length of the head, and the legs are indistinctly preserved but long. The pronotum is almost flat, and the gaster is narrow. The shape of the head was the basis for Archibald, Cover and Moreau choosing the specific epithet systenus, which is from the Greek word systenos meaning \\"tapering to a point\\". Ecology Archibald and colleagues suggested that the life habits of Avitomyrmex species may have been similar to that of extant Myrmeciinae ants. These ants may have nested in the soil or in trees, possibly being an arboreal nesting genus. This may be the case as one Myrmecia species is known to inhabit trees exclusively. Workers most likely preyed on arthropods, killing them with their sting and fed on nectar; workers would have been found foraging onto trees or low vegetation without leaving any pheromone trails to food sources or recruit nestmates, as they were solitary foragers. Avitomyrmex ants most likely used their large eyes to locate prey and for navigational purposes.

History of Social Justice at Grinnell Grinnell was founded in 1846 by a group of transplanted New Englanders with strong Congregational and social- reformer backgrounds. They organized as the Trustees of Iowa College ‚Äî originally in Davenport, Iowa. In 1859 the trustees moved the College to newly settled Grinnell, Iowa, where their abolitionist sentiments were more welcome. At the time, Grinnell was an important stop on the Underground Railroad that secretly transported slaves to freedom. Grinnell's social consciousness blossomed during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, when graduates Harry Hopkins '12, Chester Davis '11, Paul H. Appleby '13, Hallie Ferguson Flanagan '11, and Florence Stewart Kerr '12 became influential New Deal administrators. Today, Grinnell's commitment to social justice continues through a strong philosophy of self governance and personal responsibility, as well as programs and initiatives that encourage students to learn about the world beyond the campus and effect positive social change. More than 300 Grinnell alumni have served in the Peace Corps since it was founded in 1961. Together, these alumni have served in 89 countries from Afghanistan to Zambia. For example, the Wall Alumni Prize provides financial support for Grinnell alumni to engage in service projects, programs, and organizations dedicated to improving the lives of others. Under Grinnell's Expanding Knowledge Initiative, the College has introduced curricular innovations in the areas of environmental challenges, human rights, and human dignity.

She was beaten, strangled, burned, and dismembered by her classmates Sarah Anne Kolb and Cory Gregory on January 21, 2005. People involved =Victim= *Adrianne Reynolds was originally from Kilgore, Texas. She moved to East Moline, Illinois, when she was 16 to live with her adoptive father and stepmother, Tony and Joann Reynolds. She began attending Black Hawk College Outreach Center in November 2004 to earn her GED so she could realize her dream of joining the Marines. While there, she met fellow students Sarah Kolb and Cory Gregory. =Perpetrators= *Sarah Kolb was reportedly a popular girl at the Outreach Center. She lived with her mother and stepfather in the nearby town of Milan, Illinois. When Adrianne started in the school, she befriended Sarah's friend Cory Gregory and boyfriend Sean McKitrick. *Cory Gregory was also a Juggalo, and originally attended Moline High School but later transferred to the Outreach Center, where he met Sarah. He lived with his mother at the time of the incident. In January 2005, Adrianne reportedly asked Cory out, which allegedly angered Sarah. Murder On the afternoon of January 21, 2005, Sarah invited Adrianne to join her and Cory for lunch at Taco Bell; on the way there, Sarah and Adrianne reportedly began fighting. In the parking lot of Taco Bell, Cory held down Adrianne while Sarah strangled her with a belt. After the murder, Sarah and Cory took Adrianne's body to Sarah's grandparents' farm in Aledo, Illinois, where they tried to burn it with gasoline. When it failed to burn after several hours, they recruited Nathan Gaudet, a 16-year-old boy from Moline, to help dismember the body. Nathan used his grandfather's handsaw to remove Adrianne's head and arms and placed them in a garbage bag. The three teenagers ate lunch at McDonald's, then later disposed of the garbage bag at the Black Hawk State Historic Site. Adrianne's parents reported her missing after she failed to show up to work at a nearby Checkers restaurant. Authorities discovered Adrianne's remains a few days later on January 26, 2005. Arrests and trials Sarah Kolb and Cory Gregory were both charged with two counts of first-degree murder and concealment of a homicide on February 1, 2005; they both pleaded not guilty. Sarah was the first to go to trial, which began on October 31, 2005, at the Rock Island County Courthouse. After two weeks of trial and 15 hours of deliberation, the trial jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on any of the three charges. The hung jury resulted in a mistrial. One juror opted for acquittal, while eleven were in favor of conviction. At her retrial on February 6, 2006, in Dixon, Illinois, Sarah was convicted on all counts. At her sentencing a few months later, she was sentenced to 48 years in prison for murder and 5 years for concealment. These sentences were to be served consecutively, for a total of 53 years incarcerated. She is serving her sentence at the Logan Correctional Center. In the meantime, Cory Gregory pleaded guilty to all charges against him. On July 10, 2006, he was sentenced to 40 years in prison for murder and 5 years for concealment, resulting in a 45-year prison term. He is serving his sentence at the Stateville Correctional Center. Nathan Gaudet was also charged with concealment for helping to dismember Adrianne. He pleaded guilty and was given a juvenile sentence of five years. He was released from juvenile detention on November 11, 2008, after serving almost four years. On April 16, 2012, he died in an automobile accident in Indiana.

Early life Richard Bradley grew up in North Sydney. After leaving school in 1964 he joined the Sydney Morning Herald as a copyboy and then moved onto Shipping Newspapers where he completed his apprenticeship as a compositor in 1970. During this time he became more interested in film production. Early film career In 1972 he started making short films which enabled him to work in the industry full-time. He was also commissioned to produce music clips and short documentaries. Middle film career He produced his first feature film, Southern Crossing(1980), which featured jazz greats Dave Brubeck and Herbie Mann. The film was critically acclaimed internationally and enabled him to gain development funding for other feature projects and regular documentary work with The NSW Government Documentary Division. It was during this time he started to niche market into specific areas and in fundraising he produced the award winning docudrama for the Royal Flying Doctor Service- An Hour and a Half from Anywhere(1989). This film opened new doors to producing over sixty productions which included TV specials, documentaries and commercials. He also secured a co-production with Fuji TV as Australian producer on the comedy adventure The Hitchhiker (1992) which was based on a short story by Roald Dahl and screened extensively in Japan. Later film career His first attempt to make the controversial bikie movie, Brothers at War, which had distribution and presales through UIP and Channel 7, but failed to reach production. He then started on a series of Rugby league historical documentaries. The Mighty Bears 6-part series (competed 2005), The Mighty Eels 4 part series (competed 2006) and The Mighty Bulldogs 4-part series (competed 2010). During this time he produced a documentary Miracle at the Healing Ministry and re-released Southern Crossing. In 2008 he met up with South Australian producer Wayne Groom and, with financial investment from the South Australian Film Corporation, they brought back Brothers at War with director Peter Andrikidis, Paramount Pictures and Arclight Films on board. However the project was rejected for production funding by Screen Australia and a major controversy erupted when it was revealed a conflict of interest could have taken place. Although later declared in favour of Screen Australia, it caused industry outrage after it was publicized in IF Magazine. He returned to script writing in 2008 eventually completing 25 screenplays called Travelers Tales several years later. And in 2012 he produced a series of three cricket documentaries with financial support from Bankstown Cricket Club which included the life stories of Australian test players Graeme Thomas, Steve Smith, Len Pascoe and Mark Waugh and former captain Steve Waugh. His production company was engaged to make the official World War One centenary TV documentary called Headgear to Helmets for the National Rugby League - a three-minute promotional video clip was screened at all NRL matches during the Anzac weekend in 2015 on the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings and at the Australia vs New Zealand Test Match. The full documentary was completed in 2018 and first screened on the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended the war in 1918. Publicity work Richard Bradley is also a successful publicist between 1986 and 1992, he was publicist for APASCO an innovative Australian marketing research and information supplier which led to him being appointed as the Australian Media Agent for the internationally renowned American Total Quality Management expert and pioneer Dr W.

Background  At the start of the first World War, the US government passed the Lever [Food] Act (1917). This was done to conserve the food supply and increase its production in order to aid the efforts in Europe during the war. This alone helped food industries, including wheat, to take off in the United States. Sponsored by Democrat Asbury F. Lever, the Lever Act was very controversial because it gave the president authority to make the country limit their use of agricultural products. In July of 1918, the Grain Corporation (a part of the US Food Administration) took on contracts with allied governments, promising to provide as much wheat up to 200 million bushels to the Allied powers. Soon after this, the war ended, and the United States had a decision to make if they were going to honor the wheat prices they promised to farmers before the war ended. The US Food Administration used advertisements like this during World War I to urge people to conserve food in order to have enough for the soldiers. Despite the wheat industry being as mobilized as it was, there was always a constant demand for more to aid the war effort. During World War I, the wheat industry was mobilized, but following the end of it the demand started to decline, which hurt the still-mobilized agricultural industry. This resulted in the drafting of the Wheat Price Guarantee Act. Despite strong opposition from the Republican Party, the 65th Congress approved this and it was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson. The bill appropriated $1,000,000,000 in funds to keep wheat prices constant through the 1919-1920 crop year. Similar to the Lever Act, the passage of this act allowed the US Government (specifically the president) to monitor wheat prices in order to guarantee farmers profits based on what they had expected them to be if the war had continued. The minimum price per bushel was set to $2.26, which is known as a guaranteed price scheme. The Wheat Price Guarantee Act was intended to give the agricultural industry time to adjust to the war being over. Simply put, this act was a temporary continuation of the Lever [Food] Act of 1917. The Wheat Price Guarantee Act would officially expire on June 1, 1920. After this, most farmers fell into debt and this laid some of the roots that would lead to the Great Depression in the 1930s. Unlike the rest of the country, farmers felt the effects of the depression about 10‚Äì15 years before it would reach its peak. = Wheat Prices = The passage of the bill required the US to buy bushels of wheat for at least $2.26 each. Following the expiration of the bill in 1920, prices plummeted back to their typical range of $0.50‚Äì$1.50 per bushel. Having lost most of the business they had during the war, the wheat industry took a big hit. In 1931 during the Great Depression, it would hit a low of just $0.33 per bushel. = The Gronna Bill = Republican Senator Asle Gronna attempted to reverse all guarantees within this act with the Gronna Bill. Many state representatives opposed this, mostly from the Democratic Party (who had a majority in the Senate), choosing to back the farmers with a 100% guarantee on their profits. The bill did not end up passing in the end.

History  Improvement District (I.D.) No. 349 was established through the approval of Order in Council 419/2011 passed by Alberta's Lieutenant Governor in Council on September 9, 2011. It was created from lands that were separated from the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County (the Alberta portion of the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range). The effective date of the improvement district's formation was January 1, 2012. I.D. No. 349 was formed as a result of negotiations between the Province of Alberta, the City of Cold Lake, the Municipal District of Bonnyville No. 87, the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, and Lac La Biche County. Under a tax revenue sharing agreement, the City of Cold Lake will receive a portion of the tax revenue generated by oil and gas activity on the air weapons range in 2012. The revenue will make the city more sustainable, offsetting its costs to provide infrastructure and services to support the military base located within the city. As partial compensation for losing of land, Lac La Biche County received of land from the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo south of the Conklin area and north of the air weapons range. It will also receive a portion of the tax revenue generated by oil and gas activity on the air weapons range from the City of Cold Lake and receive funding assistance from the provincial government. As compensation to Wood Buffalo for the loss of jurisdiction over lands to Lac La Biche County and the new improvement district, the municipality received control over Crown land within its jurisdiction to accommodate future residential, commercial, and industrial growth. The transfer of control provided enough land for approximately 200,000 additional residents.

After Kropotkin was expelled from Switzerland and convicted in the Lyon trial of 1883 (for belonging to a defunct organization, i.e., The International), Le R√©volt√© needed a new editor. Elis√©e Reclus, who had become quite friendly with Jean Grave, recommended Grave for the editorship and, after some hesitation, Grave accepted and moved to Geneva in 1883. Due to difficulties in getting the journal into France as well as Swiss police harassment, in 1885 Grave moved back to France with the journal. The last issue of Le R√©volt√© was 14 March 1885. In 1887 the journal became La R√©volte. The switch to La R√©volte resulted from a desperate and ineffective effort to avoid legal responsibility for a fine assessed the journal for participating in an illegal lottery in support of military desertion. Le R√©volt√© was issued semimonthly before May 1886 and afterwards was a four page weekly. The journal‚Äôs circulation in 1886 was about 4,000 and by 1889 had grown to 6,000. After 1895, the journal was named Les Temps Nouveaux; it ceased publication in 1914. References *Louis Patsouras (2003). The Anarchism of Jean Grave. Montreal: Black Rose Books. *Martin A.

The station has a free Park and Ride lot with about 575 parking spaces available. Though the station is in South Jordan and its surroundings to the west are now undergoing greenfield development, it is also fairly close to Sandy's The Shops at South Town mall, which is just across I-15 to the east. Further north of the Station is Salt Lake Community College's Larry H. Miller Campus. The station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. The station opened, along with the rest of FrontRunner South, on December 10, 2012 and is operated by Utah Transit Authority. All of UTA's TRAX and FrontRunner trains and stations, as well as all fixed route buses, are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities. Since not all FrontRunner passenger cars are wheelchair accessible, signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the passenger cars clearly indicate accessibility options. In addition, each train has one or more Train Hosts available to provide assistance as may be needed, including the placement of ramps for wheelchair boarding. In accordance with the Utah Clean Air Act and UTA ordinance, \\"smoking is prohibited on UTA vehicles as well as UTA bus stops, TRAX stations, and FrontRunner stations\\".

They grew up in Boone, NC, before returning to the city after High School in 2002. The group was founded in late 2007 by brothers Nicholas and Peter Furgiuele previously of A Fir-Ju Well. They were joined by Peter Delorenzo and Matt McCalvin. This line-up recorded a self-titled EP. Gringo Star's debut album All Y'all was self-released in 2008 and subsequently distributed in Europe by Cargo Records in 2010. It was produced by Ben H. Allen. The album was described in by Pitchfork as \\"the songs are strong, but it's the sweat that will need to do the convincing\\" while PopMatters found it resembling The Kinks. The band signed to Brooklyn-based record label Gigantic Music for Count Yer Lucky Stars, released on October 25, 2011. It was also produced by Allen and engineered by James Salter. Rolling Stone called it \\"modern garage-rock\\" with \\"newfound psychedelic, meandering impulses\\". Popmatters found it \\"lacks the sense of fun\\", while Consequence of Sound described the album as having \\"simple, driving hooks and catchy songwriting\\". The album made many lists for one of the best albums of the year. The song \\"Shadow\\" from Count Yer Lucky Stars was featured on NPR's All Songs Considered in its 2011 Fall Music Preview. The band was featured in a 2011 documentary, Hurry up and Wait. McCalvin was replaced by Christopher Kaufmann soon afterwards. Delorenzo left the band in the following year. The band released the album Floating Out To See that they recorded, mixed, and produced themselves, at Studio 234 Atlanta, released October 22, 2013, on their own label, My Anxious Mouth Records. This album, too, garnered positive attention, with some music writers picking it as one of the 10 best albums of the year and one saying that it was a \\"testament of what can be done if you take a risk or simply use your imagination.\\"and Their song \\"Find a Love\\" from Floating Out to See was featured as the \\"Song of the Day\\" by KEXP. Amazing for a self-released album from an independent band, the album reached #29 on the CMJ Top 200 charts and #13 on the FMQB Submodern Charts. Kaufmann left the band in 2013.

She received her early training at the Boston Conservatory and under various private instructors including Madame Etta Edwards, then in Boston. Le Baron first sang with the Bostonian Opera Company before joining Fritzi Scheff and her famous company. During this time she played Lady Jane in The Two Roses by Ludwig Engl√§nder and Stanislaus Stange, with a libretto adapted from Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer, and as Marie Louise de Bouvray in Mlle. Modiste by Victor Herbert and Henry Blossom. Over the following seasons she would perform with the Castle Square Opera Company, San Carlo Company and on two separate occasions the Aborn Opera Company. With the latter she played the title role in Carmen, Seibel in Faust and Suzuki in Madame Butterfly. In 1913 she shared the male role of Alan-a- Dale with actress Florence Wickham in the comic opera Robin Hood by Reginald De Koven and Harry B. Smith. As her career began to wind down Le Baron settled in Lincoln, Nebraska where she had always been well received and opened a voice school. She died there on February 11, 1918, after struggling with a long and painful illness. She was survived by her son, Ernest Gillmore (or Gilmore), whose father she had married at an early age.

It was inaugurated by former President Michelle Bachelet on January 11, 2010 as part of government's commemoration of the bicentennial of Chile.  History  Building of the Museum In her speech on May 21, 2007, before the full Congress, President Michelle Bachelet announced the construction of a memorial museum, and a month later she announced a public competition to select an architectural design for it. On August 28 of that year, it was announced that the winning project belonged to a group of Brazilian architects from the office \\"Estudio America\\", located in S√£o Paulo. In 2008, a contest to determine who would be in charge of the operation of the museum; \\"√Årbol de Color S. A.\\" was chosen. The first stone of the Memorial Museum was laid on December 10, 2008 by President Bachelet, who was also a victim of torture during the dictatorship of Pinochet. The materials and documentation for the museum's collection were mostly provided by the organization Casa de la Memoria, whose donations arrived on June 16, 2009 at the La Moneda Palace. Parallel to the construction of the museum, on December 3, 2009, the museum's board was formed, and on January 6, 2010, Romy Schmidt was appointed as its executive director. Finally, President Bachelet inaugurated the museum on January 11, 2010, two months before finishing her term. The museum houses torture devices used during the Pinochet dictatorship, letters to family members by prisoners in detention centers, newspaper clippings, and testimony from survivors.

The railway line from Ljubljana to Zagreb runs along the left bank of the Sava and there is a small railway station in the settlement. Name Blanca was attested in written records in 1309 as Blanitz. The name is derived from *Blanica, a diminutive of the obsolete noun *blana (cf. Czech blana 'meadow, pasture', Belarusian balona 'empty land before a village', Bulgarian blana 'lawn, meadow'). The name therefore originally refers to the local geography. History Prehistoric burial mounds were found in the area in 1892, testifying to early settlement. A school was established in 1874. During the Second World War, a ferry across the Sava in Blanca was used to main contact with Partisan units in Lower Carniola. A civic center was built in 1949, and a fire station in 1954.

Development Dallas Spirit was built to attempt to win back to back two aviation prizes offered at the peak of record- setting aviation accomplishments in 1927. The first was to win the $25,000 Dole Air Derby between Oakland California and Honolulu Hawaii. The second was to win the $25,000 prize for a flight between Dallas and Hong Kong sponsored by William E. Easterwood. Dallas Spirit was built at the Swallow factory at 2401 North Hillside, in Wichita, Kansas. Design Dallas Spirit was a high- wing monoplane with conventional landing gear. The dual wingstruts featured large airfoil shaped fairings. It was painted green and silver. Operational history Dallas Spirit, with Captain Bill Erwin and his wife, Constance (1927) Dallas Spirit was unveiled at Love Field in Dallas, Texas on 6 August 1927. It was intended to bring as much publicity to the city as the Spirit of St. Louis did earlier in the year with Charles Lindbergh's solo transatlantic crossing. =The Dole Air Race= The scheduled departure date was 16 August 1927. Dallas Spirit was flown by 31-year-old William Portwood Erwin and navigated by 27-year-old Alvin Eichwaldt. Before the race started, two planes had already crashed, killing all their occupants. Most competitors barely could take off, and had mishaps, or turned back just after departure. Dallas Spirit was one of these unlucky entrants, returning shortly after the first attempt with six feet of fabric torn from the side, blamed on a misaligned access panel under the navigator. Of the four aircraft that continued, two aircraft reported landings in Hawaii, and two disappeared: Miss Doran and Golden Eagle. Dole and William F. Mallosa, who had backed Miss Doran, put a combined $50,000 in rewards together to find the missing pilots. Erwin and Eichwaldt (1927) Repairs to the tail section of the Dallas Spirit tail section took two days. On 18 August, Erwin decided to attempt the California to Hawaii trip without the prize, searching for the missing aircraft Miss Doran and Golden Eagle, then continuing on to Manila and Hong Kong. A 55-watt short wave radio was removed from another contestant, the Pabco Flyer and installed in the Dallas Spirit. Amateur radio operators across the country monitored the transmissions on the 33.1-meter wavelength. At 9 pm, Eichwald sent a message that the aircraft went into a spin and recovered, followed by a second S.O.S that the plane had gone into a spin. The abrupt signal loss in the middle of the call occurred as the plane crashed into the ocean about 650 miles west of Oakland. On 27 October 1927, a silver piece of aileron was found washed ashore at Redondo Beach, California, which was thought to have come from the lost ship. \\"Discovery of a number, 43449-10, stamped in indelible ink upon two wooden inner ribs, upon the wing, lent hope that it might be possible to trace it to its origin. The fragment was taken to the biology laboratory at the University of Southern California, to determine how long it was in the water.\\" A check of records indicated that the missing aircraft had silver elevators while the rest of the ship was green. Dallas Spirit was built on credit with the promise of the Swallow Airplane Company receiving some of the prize money. The disappearance of the plane was enough to send the company into receivership. Owner Mollendick sold off his interests to aviation investor Victor Roos.

Marine subtropical demersal fish, which lives at the depth up to , usually up to . The maximal length of the fish is . Like other members of the genus Syngnathus, S. floridae demonstrate sex-role reversal between males and females in mating and caring for their young. The females deposit their eggs into a brood pouch in the male during copulation. The males then fertilize the eggs and provide all post-zygotic care by physically carrying the eggs and transferring nutrients to the developing embryos through a placenta-like connection. The eggs hatch about 10 days later and are subsequently independent of their parental support. Dusky pipefish are polygynandrous because both males and females mate with multiple partners. However, males are the limiting sex because they can only carry a certain number of eggs in their brood pouch at one time. In contrast, females produce more eggs than they can deposit, so they have unlimited success. Furthermore, sexual selection acts on body size, selecting for larger males. Larger males can carry more eggs and have more female mates, and thus the larger males have a higher reproductive success than the smaller males. Environmental variations between populations of dusky pipefish influence their reproductive success. Temperature of water plays a major role in reproductive success by influencing sexual selection. As temperature increases, the rate for potential reproduction increases for both males and females, but faster for males. This shows that temperature influences sexual selection by selecting against the slower rate of reproduction in females. Higher temperature influences reproductive success by increasing the number of eggs produced by the female and thus decreasing the number of mates the male needs to fill its brood pouch. In addition, lower temperatures yield a lower reproductive success in males because they do not accept as many eggs in this environment.

As Korean society became Confucianized, the four family ceremonies of Confucian culture (coming-of-age ceremony, wedding, funeral, and ancestral rite; known collectively as ) have developed elaborately, and continue to influence Korean life to the present day. Ceremonial food was an important part of such cultural tradition and developed with variations across different regions and cultures.  Childbirth  When a child is born, the family offers a samshin sang (), a table consisting three bowls of rice and three bowls of miyeok guk (Korean sea mustard soup) to the three gods of childbirth (), as three has been traditionally believed to be a fortunate number in Korea. The same food is also offered to the mother. Sea mustard, rich in iron and calcium, is considered beneficial for new mother's health.  Baby's 100th day (baekil)  Baekil (), a baby's 100th day, is celebrated with a feast including rice, sea mustard soup, steamed white rice cakes (), and five- colored songpyeon with the family's friends and relatives. The rice cakes are distributed to neighbors. The white rice cake represents innocence, and the five-colored songpyeon harmony.  First birthday (dol)  During dol (), the first birthday of a baby, the baby is elaborately dressed with a colorful outfit, and food including rice, sea mustard soup, steamed white rice cakes, five-colored songpyeon, steamed noodle, and jujube are prepared. Various objects such as a book, coins, raw rice, a bow and an arrow (for a boy), and a ruler (for a girl) are put on the celebration table. This is for a tradition of foretelling the baby's future by observing which object the baby touches first (a book for a scholar, coins for a rich person, etc.). The occasion is celebrated by family's friends and relatives, and rice cakes are distributed to neighbors.  Coming-of-age ceremony (gwallye)  Gwallye (), the coming- of-age ceremony, is performed between the ages of 15 and 20. After the ceremony, a man begins to wear sangtu (; Korean topknot) and gat (a traditional hat) and a woman jjok (; a traditional bun hairstyle) and binyeo (a traditional hairpin). The ceremonial food includes rice wine, rice cake, noodle soup, sikhye, and sujunggwa.Jang et al. (2005, p. 88) Unlike other traditional ceremonies, gwallye is rarely performed in Korea these days as it has been incorporated into the wedding ceremony and the traditional hairstyle is no longer worn by most Koreans.  Wedding ceremony (hollye)  In hollye (), traditional Korean wedding ceremony, a table called daeryesang () is placed between the groom and the bride. The table setting varies according to regions, but usually consists of rice wine, rice cakes, chestnuts, jujubes, and other foods as well as a vase with a pine branch and a bamboo branch, a red candle, a blue candle, a live rooster and a hen wrapped in red and blue clothes. The color of blue represents groom, and red the bride; chestnuts and jujubes mean longevity and fertility, and pine and bamboo fidelity. The groom and the bride bows to each other and shares rice wine in a decorated gourd cup. Foods prepared by the bride's family for the groom's parents are called pyebaek. Chestnuts and jujubes are offered to the groom's father, and pyeonpo (Korean steamed beef patty), yukpo (Korean beef jerky), and braised chicken to the mother. The groom's father also gives jujubes to his new daughter-in-law, which represent fertility.Jang et al. (2005, p.92) With other foods, noodle soup is usually served to wedding guests, which represents longevity. .  Funeral (sangrye)  In sangrye (), traditional Korean funeral, mourners stay up all night in the funeral hall. Alcoholic drinks, pork or beef head meat (), and yukgaejang are frequently served to them. The red chili pepper powder in yukgaejang is believed to protect guests from ghosts and spirits.  Ancestral rite (jerye)  Jerye () or jesa (), the Korean traditional rite for ancestors, is performed on Seol (Lunar New Year's Day), Chuseok (Korean harvest festival), and anniversaries of ancestors' deaths. Rules for table setting in ancestral rites are set in Confucian literature, but variations exist according to regions and clans. Some of the general rules are as follows.Jang et al. (2005, pp. 97‚Äì99) * On the first row of the table, rice, rice wine, spoon and chopsticks are placed. * On the second row, noodle soup, rice cakes, beef soup, chicken soup, and fish soup are placed. Rice cakes are placed on the eastern part of the table and noodle on the western part. * On the third row, meat and fish dishes are placed. Fish is placed on the eastern part and meat on the western part. * On the fourth row, kimchi (made without chili pepper) and vegetable dishes are placed. Kimchi is placed on the eastern part and other vegetables on the western part. * On the fifth row, fruits (jujube, apples, pears, chestnuts, etc.) and sweets are placed. Red fruits are placed on the eastern part and white fruits on the western part. = Foods prohibited in rites = Foods traditionally believed to expel ghosts and spirits, such as red chili pepper, garlic and peaches, are prohibited in ancestral rites. Fish without scales which had been considered unclean and fish of whose names end with the syllable \\"chi\\" () ‚Äì anchovy (), mackerel pike (), and cutlassfish (), which had been considered cheap ‚Äì are also not placed on ritual tables. = Regional variations = Food for ritual ceremonies varies considerably between regions due to different cultures and availability of foods. For example, grilled shark has been uniquely offered in the ceremony in the Gyeongsang province and skate dishes in the Jeolla province.

Life The second son of John Jenkinson, by Frances, daughter of Rear-admiral John Barker of Guildford, he was born at Winchester on 2 September 1781. His father was the brother of Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool, a colonel in the army, joint secretary for Ireland and gentleman-usher to Queen Charlotte; he died on 1 May 1805. Jenkinson was educated at Winchester College, where he was elected scholar in 1793. On 22 December 1800 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, graduated B.A. in 1804 and proceeded M.A. in 1807 and D.D. in 1817. He became a prebendary of Worcester Cathedral on 30 August 1808, rector of Leverington, Cambridgeshire, on 8 July 1812, Dean of Worcester on 28 November 1817 and Master of St. Oswald's Hospital, Worcester, on 8 January 1818. During his time as master, the hospital's running came under scrutiny. On 23 July 1825, Jenkinson was elected Bishop of St David's, and on 4 August 1825 was appointed canon of Durham Cathedral. On 13 June 1827 he became Dean of Durham, and held the deanery, then worth ¬£9,000 a year, with his bishopric for the remainder of his life.Described by Owen Chadwick as a moderate, he was one of the bishops voting for the second reading of the Great Reform Bill of 1832.Owen Chadwick, The Victorian Church, Part One 1829‚Äì1859 (1987), p. 31. He died at Great Malvern on 7 July 1840, and was buried in Worcester Cathedral. Jenkinson maintained a school for the children of the poor at Carmarthen, which usually contained 150 scholars. He published some sermons. Family He married, on 8 April 1813, Frances Augusta, daughter of Augustus Pechell of Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire, and by her left two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, George Samuel Jenkinson, succeeded his uncle, Sir Charles, as eleventh baronet in 1855.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Dr≈æavna Tiskarna, p. 86. , , , or ) is a village in the Lower Sava Valley in southeastern Slovenia. It consists of a nucleated centre on two terraces on the right bank of the Sava River along the main road from Celje to Kr≈°ko, and two hamlets, Pu≈°e and Redna, on the slopes of the nearby hills. It is the central settlement of the Local Community of Bo≈°tanj, the largest local community in the Municipality of Sevnica. The village has a post office, a fire station, a primary school, two shops, a gas station, two bars, a restaurant, and a cultural hall named the TVD Partizan Hall (). It is surrounded by fields and orchards. History The oldest archaeological findings in the area of Bo≈°tanj are from the Hallstatt period (the 8th to 4th century BC), the older part of the Iron Age. Several burial mounds, excavated at the turn of the twentieth century, were created in the period from the end of the 8th century to the 5th century. They are a link between the cultural spaces of the Balkans and the Pannonia of the time. The settlement was first mentioned in a document written on 31 October 1197 in Strasbourg. It mentions two noblemen from Bo≈°tanj, who were subjects of the Diocese of Kr≈°ko. The second mention dates to 1228 and stats that there were ten farms in Bo≈°tanj at the time. Since 1322, Bo≈°tanj was property of the Lords of ≈Ωovnek and later of the Counts of Celje, who succeeded them. In the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, people in Bo≈°tanj were mostly farmers, some of them were craftsmen, such as millers, carpenters, roofers, and some were innkeepers. In 1850, a primary school was established in the village. In 1924, the town got its first electricity, produced by the Jakil Sawmill on the Mirna River. The entire village was electrified in 1934. During World War II, Bo≈°tanj was occupied by the German forces. Starting in October 1941, they evicted most of the population and replaced them with Gottschee Germans. A police force station was established in the village. After December 1942, Bo≈°tanj became the seat of the main political municipality, composed of the political municipalities of Bo≈°tanj, Gabrje, and Impolje. In October 1943, the Slovene Partisans started an offensive in the area. They succeeded in taking the German post in Bo≈°tanj on 12 October, but had to retreat the following day. During these operations, several buildings in the village were burned; however the day was rainy and the village was mainly spared. Later that month, the Germans shot three Partisans. In 1949, a granite memorial was erected in the local cemetery in their memory. A number of residential buildings were erected in Bo≈°tanj around 1960. In 1984, the side roads in Bo≈°tanj were paved with asphalt. Landmarks =Parish church= The first church in Bo≈°tanj was already standing in the 12th century, when the historical sources mention a parish branch in Bo≈°tanj, although they do not mention the church. It is probable that it was dedicated to the Holy Cross. The Parish of Bo≈°tanj was established in 1509. In that year, the construction of a new church building started in Bo≈°tanj and was completed in 1538. It was oriented in an east‚Äìwest direction and surrounded by a cemetery. In the 19th century, to address the needs of a large parish, the parish priest Ignacij Kutnar ordered the construction of a larger building, which was finished in 1853. The current church, dedicated to the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (), is a three-aisled hall with all aisles of the same height. It was mainly built in the neo- Romanesque style. It has four altars. The main altar of the new church was made in 1872. One of the side altars was the main altar in the former church and is dated to 1677, whereas the other three were made in the 19th century. The belfry has been preserved. In a chancel there is a memorial plaque to the Bo≈°tanj nobleman Wilhelm von Lamberg, which dates to 1574. The entire church was painted by Jo≈æe Cerin≈°ek in 1933. =Stein Castle= Stein Castle (Slovene: ) next to the main road northwest of the village core was probably erected at the beginning of the 17th century. Today, only its Renaissance defence tower and its foundations are still visible. A Baroque chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas stands next to the castle. The castle and the chapel were burned in 1943, during World War II. A residential castle building and a stable are located on the other side of the tower and are referred to as \\"the Manor\\" today. Before the war, it had a number of owners; the last one was the industrialist after World War I. Now it houses a cement factory. =Na Gavgah= Na Gavgah (literally, 'at the gallows') is a forest northwest of the core of Bo≈°tanj. In the past, the local gallows were located there, which gave the forest its name. Na Gavgah is a habitat for Rhododendron luteum, which grows in only a few locations in Slovenia. In May 2006 information signs were installed at the site. The plant is also depicted in the coat of arms of the Local Community of Bo≈°tanj. =Power plant= A run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plant on the Sava was built in the settlement in 2006. It has an average yearly capacity of 115 GWh, corresponding to roughly 1% of current electricity production in Slovenia.

The union was first established as the Federated Candle, Soap, Soda & Starch Employees' Union of Australia, before changing its name in 1914.Smith, Bruce A. created 20 April 2001, last modified 6 August 2010. \\"Trade Union Entry: Manufacturing Grocers Employees Federation of Australia\\". Australian Trade Union Archives. Retrieved 13 September 2011. The union represented workers employed in manufacturing grocers' sundries and non-edible grocery products, particularly in the southern states of South Australia and Victoria. In 1988 the union amalgamated with the Federated Millers and Mill Employees' Union to form the Federated Millers and Manufacturing Grocers Employees' Association of Australia, which in turn merged with a number of unions to form the National Union of Workers.  Activities  The Manufacturing Grocers' Union undertook a wide variety of activities to pursue the interests of its members. The union made representations to government and the public in favour of protectionist measures to ensure the competitiveness of products manufactured in Australia with international imports. The M.G.U. also publicised the poor working conditions of its members, including problems such as noise, dust and physical fatigue. The South Australian trade union leader and later politician Theo Nicholls served as part-time secretary of the union in South Australia, and was active in its organisation.  Industrial disputes  The Manufacturing Grocers' Union underwent several bitter industrial disputes during its history, including a number of strikes. The first major strike the union was involved in was in April 1916, when the M.G.U., along with a number of other unions, participated in a sympathy strike with the Storemen and Packers' Union over the dismissal of several men at a Parsons' Brothers factory in Melbourne. The strike lasted for several months and led to shortages of several products in Victoria, due to blockade of goods by the employers. The strike eventually collapsed in June 1916, with all strikers returning to work. The Manufacturing Grocers' Union held another major strike in 1948 at the match factories of Bryant and May, in Richmond, Melbourne, over an increase in the required daily output of matches. The dispute was resolved when all parties agreed to allow the Commonwealth Statistician determine a fair daily output per worker.  Demarcation disputes  The Manufacturing Grocers' Union made efforts to establish a branch of the union in New South Wales, the most populous state of Australia, but this attempt was thwarted by the Australian Workers' Union, who represented the relevant workers at the time.  Amalgamation  In 1988 the Manufacturing Grocers' Union amalgamated with the Federated Millers and Mill Employees' Union, another small union representing workers in food processing. The resulting body, the Federated Millers and Manufacturing Grocers Employees' Association of Australasia, was short-lived and subsequently amalgamated with the National Union of Storeworkers, Packers, Rubber and Allied Workers to form the National Union of Workers.

He attended and graduated from film school. He briefly lived in Australia during this time.  Career  = 2003‚Äì2010: Malbec and early musical contributions = After moving to Los Angeles, Pontius joined the indie pop band Malbec which was fronted by Pablo Signori and included music producer Speakerbomb. From 2003 to 2011, they put out seven EP's and one full length album, cutting out their own niche of pop rock, hip hop and electronic music. They signed a publishing deal with Songs Music Publishing in 2007 and had their songs synced in films and television shows like One Tree Hill, Flight of the Phoenix, Long Way Round, The Omen, Palo Alto, and NBC's Chuck, among others. Besides being the band's drummer, Pontius also directed and edited all of their music videos. Pontius left the band in December 2009 to focus on Foster the People; he had been working with Mark Foster for a few months and was very excited about his work. Malbec disbanded the following year. After leaving Malbec, and before Foster the People found success, Pontius produced an electronic pop-leaning solo record under the name Discovery.

It is dedicated to Chenna Kesava Perumal. There is the nearby Chenna Malleeswarar Temple. They are twin temples. The temple was the first to be built in the new settlement; since the construction of Madras city by the British East India Company.Srinivasachari, Introduction, p xxix Chennakesava Perumal is a manifestation of the Hindu god Vishnu. And considered as the patron deity of Chennai, Chenna pattanam may be named after the Chenna Kesava Perumal Temple. The word 'chenni' in Tamil means face, and the temple was regarded as the face of the city.  History  Sources about the history of this temple have the following: * According to Srinivasan, T.A The Original twin temples' ( Chenna kesava perumal and Chenna Malleeswarar ) location was later occupied by the High court building. The original twin temples' history dates back to 1646 CE. Grants made to the original twin temples by Beri Thimmappa (dubash meaning interpreter, to Francis Day) and Nagabattar were recorded. Attack by other European powers and attack and looting of temples by Hyder Ali's forces caused the devotees to relocate some vigrahams to the Thiruneermalai Temple. The twin temples were demolished by the British, for the purpose of security and expansion of the nearby Fort St.George. Manali Muthu Krishna Mudaliar, translator for Lord Piccode, built new twin temples in 1700 CE in a different location (at Devaraja mudali Street, later called Sowcarpet). He donated his lands, used his own funds to build and he refused the money from the British, accepting only land from them. * According to the official Chenna Kesava temple website: \\"The original Chenna Kesava perumal temple was located even in the 17th century AD in the place where the Madras High Court is currently located. When the original temple was present, there were a lot of problems in Chennai such as invasion by French and Tippu Sultan.The British East India Company demolished the original temple in 1757 AD. Due to public outcry, the British East India Company donated land and some money to Manali Muthu krishna Mudaliar, who built the new Chenna Kesava Perumal temple in the year of 1762, at a different location i.e at Devaraja Mudali Street in Sowcarpet area of Chennai city. Along with this Vishnu temple, he also built a temple for Shiva - Chenna Malleeswarar temple, thus Chennai got twin temples at Sowcarpet.\\" * According to Srinivasachari.C. S, The Mallikesvarar Temple was constructed by Alanganatha Pillai, assistant chief merchant to the British East India Company, in the 17th century AD. The temple is first mentioned in a document of 1652 as \\"Mally Carjuns Old Pagoda\\". It is also believed to be the Muthialpet Pagoda depicted in a Madras map of 1710. * According to Muthiah.S, the Chennakesava Perumal Temple was constructed in 1646. * According to the Times of India article, The twin temples of Chenna Kesava and Chenna Malleeswara Swami were originally built by Beri Thimappa, the dubash who brokered the deal between Francis Day and the local chieftain for the small strip of beach that was to become the city of Madras. The city's name \\"Chennai\\" is said to have been derived from these temples.

He was also one of the leaders in the Philippine Falange during the 1930s and 1940s.Herm√≥genes E. Bacareza. A history of Philippine-German relations. National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) - APO Production Unit EDSA, 1980. Pp. 127. Early life Z√≥bel was born in Madrid, Spain, on October 9, 1877 to Jacobo Z√≥bel y Zangroniz and Trinidad de Ayala y R√≥xas. He had a twin named, Alfonso, who died the age of five. His other siblings were Fernando Antonio, Margarita and Gloria (who died a few months after her birth). He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Real Colegio Alfonso XII in El Escorial, Spain. He pursued postgraduate studies at Liceo de San Luis and the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe, Paris. He was very much interested in engineering and mining, so he also took courses at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Mines de Paris, Paris from 1897 to 1901. He also pursued the study of painting in the French capital. He married his cousin Consuelo R√≥xas de Ayala in Manila on October 16, 1901. The couple had three children - Jacobo (father of Enrique J. Z√≥bel), Alfonso (father of Jaime Z√≥bel de Ayala) and Mercedes. The union was short-lived after Consuelo succumbed to cholera on September 25, 1907 at the age of 30. He was a widower for three years when he met Fermina Montojo de Torrontegui. She was the daughter of the Spanish admiral Patricio Montojo, who led the Spanish fleet against Commodore George Dewey in the Battle of Manila Bay. They were married on November 12, 1911 and had four children - Matilde, Consuelo, Gloria, and Fernando (and namesake of his brother, Fernando Antonio). Business career He was a managing partner of Ayala y Compa√±ia from 1901 to 1913 and from 1920 until 1943. In 1914, his children from Consuelo - Jacobo, Alfonso and Mercedes - would inherit Hacienda San Pedro de Macati from his aunt (and mother of Consuelo), Carmen R√≥xas de Ayala. The property was first purchased in 1851 by his great uncle, Jose Bonifacio R√≥xas, for 52,800 pesos. It was inherited by R√≥xas' son, Pedro Pablo R√≥xas (and upon his death in 1912, by his widow, Carmen). In 1929, ownership of the property would be transferred to Ayala y Compa√±ia. The property - which had lain in the family's hands, undeveloped and undisturbed for several decades - would serve as the basis of his family's future wealth. During the 1930s, portions of the property would be developed, as the company's initial foray into real estate development. In 1937, he offered 42 hectares of the property to be leased for the development of Nielson Field. On June 21, 1924, the Ayala distillery (Destileria y Licoreria de Ayala y Compa√±ia, maker of Ginebra San Miguel) was sold by Ayala y Compa√±ia to La Tonde√±a Inc. Aside from his involvement with the Ayala company, he also established La Porcelanica in 1903 - the first ceramics factory in the Philippines. The following year, he established a glass factory with Eduardo Soriano (father of Andr√©s Soriano Sr.). He co-founded Filipinas Compa√±ia de Seguros in 1913 and ventured into insurance and finance as vice president of Insular Life Assurance Company, a director of Philippine Guaranty Co. and a director of Banco Espa√±ol-Filipino. Cultural and philanthropic activities Z√≥bel inherited the liberal ideas and interests of his father Don Jacobo Z√≥bel y Zangroniz. Like his father, he was educated in Europe, not only in business and sciences, but also in the arts. He loved the cultivation of the arts and culture. His mansion on Plaza del Carmen and Leon Guerrero Street in Ermita, Manila became the focal point of many tertulias and salon de artistas. He donated his vast collection of books on European literature to the University of the Philippines library. He was the first modern Hispanist and founded Premio Z√≥bel in 1929 in order to preserve and promote the use of the Spanish language, which he believed was the true language of Filipino nationalists. His great obsession was the conservation of the spiritual ties between Spain and the Philippines through the promotion of its language and culture. Premio Z√≥bel was the fulfillment of his desire that \\"No quiero que el espa√±ol muera en Filipinas\\". Today, Premio Z√≥bel is administered by his grandchildren, Georgina Padilla MacCrohon and Alejandro Padilla (both children of his daughter, Gloria). Together with brother Fernando Antonio, he co-founded Casino Espa√±ol de Manila, a socio- civic club for Hispano-Filipinos. He established the Patronato Escolar Espa√±ol and the Asociaci√≥n Pro-Idioma Hispano, both efforts directed at strengthening the role of Spanish in the educational system. He was a founding member of Academia Filipina de la Lengua Espa√±ola in 1924, which became the correspondent of the prestigious Real Academia de la Lengua Espa√±ola. He dabbled as a Spanish-language publisher when he resuscitated the moribund El Mercantil. He supported the arts and gave scholarships, among them, a young Fernando Amorsolo, who in gratitude would teach his son, Fernando, the rudiments of art. In 1930, he helped fund the construction of the Manila Metropolitan Theater, a landmark art deco building designed by Juan Arellano. He became the treasurer of the Metropolitan Theater Company. In 1936, he reported the discovery of a horde of Oriental pottery found on his Calatagan, Batangas property to the National Museum director Eduardo Quisumbing and subsequently funded the ensuing excavations. In April 1939, he was appointed by General Franco as the acting consul for Spain in the Philippines. The government of Spain, in admiration of his many philanthropic and cultural causes, awarded him La Gran Cruz Isabela la Cat√≥lica and the Medalla del M√©rito Civil. Death Z√≥bel died on February 17, 1943 in Manila, at the height of the Japanese Occupation during World War II.

Description The present building is a large three-story house running north-south. On the east side is a stair turret with a small watch-chamber above. The roofs are steep with crow-stepped gables. One dormer bears the date 1678. The building is similar in style and date to the Mansion House in nearby Rothesay, and is likely to have been built by the same architect. The interior of the house dates from the 1990s restoration. The earlier interiors were mostly lost when the building was divided into flats, and further damage occurred when a fire broke out in June 1991 while the restoration was in progress. Architectural history There is no trace of the earlier castle that was only a \\"few minutes walk\\" away. (Although a ruined tower named \\"Ascog Castle\\" exists, it is not on the Isle of Bute but in mainland Argyll.) The present building was originally an L-plan tower house, with a projecting watch-chamber above the staircase, from which \\"missiles could be dropped on unwelcome and unsuspecting guests\\". Buildings of this type typically date from around 1600. The stonework of the house bears witness to various changes to the floor levels and layout over the course of the building's history. The windows were enlarged in the 18th century. During the reign of Victoria, a large servants' wing was added at the back; and during the reign of Edward VII, a drawing room and staircase were added on the north side. By 1970 the house had been divided into flats, but structural problems set in. Parts of the house became derelict, and the west wall was in danger of collapse. A programme of restoration was carried out in the early 1990s by the Landmark Trust. This included the removal of the Victorian wing, and most of the Edwardian additions. The Edwardian staircase was left \\"in detached whimsy\\" as a free-standing turret containing an additional bedroom. Ownership history In 1594, John Stewart of Kilchattan bought the Ascog estate, and may have been the builder of the first house on the site. In 1673, his grandson, also named John Stewart, married Margaret Cunningharn. They may have been responsible for the rebuilding and enlargement that lead to the carved date 1678. In 1773 or 1763 the then owner, another John Stewart, wrote a will setting up a complicated entail to ensure that the house remained in the Stewart family. When he died without children, the house and estate passed to a distant relative Archibald MacArthur of Milton, who changed his name to Archibald MacArthur Stewart. This inheritance was noted by a contemporary writer, who stated that he was an eccentric, \\"exceedingly parsimonious\\", and that \\"he had a great attachment to swine, and kept a litter of pigs in his bedroom\\". He also died without children, and the heir was an American citizen, Frederick Campbell. Under the terms of the will he had to change his name to Stewart and to become a British citizen. This took ten years and required a Special Act of Parliament. He then tried to sell the Ascog estate, at which point a number of claimants emerged, insisting that under the terms of the entail they would be entitled to a share of the proceeds. Litigation ensued, in the course of which Frederick died. The next heir was Frederick's brother Ferdinand Campbell. He succeeded where his brother had not: in only a short time he managed to become a British citizen, had the House of Lords overturn the old will, and, in 1831, sold the estate. It was acquired by Robert Thom, a civil engineer, who then styled himself \\"Laird of Ascog\\". After Thom, the ownership is less well documented, but in 1939 the house was bought by the 5th Marquess of Bute for housing estate workers. The house was acquired by the Landmark Trust in 1989 and the building is now maintained using income from its use as holiday accommodation.

It is owned and operated by Orsted. It is named after the Danish physicist Hans Christian √òrsted, the discoverer of electromagnetism. History H. C. √òrsted Power Station against the evening sky Copenhagen's first three power stations, Gothersgade Power Station from 1892 and the Western and Easter Power Stations from 1898 and 1901, all operated by K√∏benhavns Belysningsv√¶sen, used direct current technology which required a location close to the consumers. The introduction of alternating current technology made it possible to build larger plants at less central locations and H. C. √òrsted Power Station, designed by Andreas Fussing, was built between 1916 and 1920 on Kalvebod Beach to the south of the city. The location by the sea and close to the Southern Harbour provided easy access to cooling water and coal-loading facilities. On its completion it became the largest power station in Denmark, a position it kept until 1940. It had enough capacity to supply all of the Copenhagen area with lighting, reducing the three existing power stations to back-up systems and transformer stations. The power station was expanded and adapted in 1924 and again between 1930 and 1932 by Louis Hygom and Valdemar Schmidt. The 1932 expansion saw the installation of a gigantic Burmeister & Wain diesel engine which held the position as the world's largest diesel engine for about 30 years. This engine is still on the grounds operating as an exhibit for DieselHouse, an interactive exhibition museum. It is started up the first and third Sunday every month at 11 am and runs for 5 to 10 minutes. Coal remained the principal source of fuel until 1994 when it was converted into a natural gas-fired power station. Architecture The building is red-washed with tall slender windows and blue chimneys. It has been designated as one of 25 Danish Industrial Heritage Sites by the Danish Heritage Agency. Technical description Today the primary task of the power station is to supply district heating to the district- heating network of Greater Copenhagen. Its capacity is 185 MW electricity and 815 MJ/s district heating.

It became a well established inland route, and an alternative to the coastal El Camino Real trail used since the 1770s in the period. It ran from San Pedro Bay and the Pueblo de Los √Ångeles, over the Transverse Ranges through Tejon Pass and down through the San Emigdio Mountains to the San Joaquin Valley, where it followed a route along the eastern slopes of the Coast Ranges between aguaje (watering places) and arroyos. It passed west out of the valley, over the Diablo Range at Corral Hollow Pass into the Livermore Valley, to end at the Oakland Estuary on the eastern San Francisco Bay. History The route of El Camino Viejo was well established by the 1820s, and the route was in use by Spanish colonial \\"carretas\\" (ox carts) as early as 1780, as a more direct route than El Camino Real to the recently established Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s and Mission San Francisco de As√≠s. At that time the Bay Area section ran from the mouth of Arroyo Las Positas southwest across the mouth of the Arroyo Mocho and Arroyo Valle to Arroyo de la Laguna (later the lands of Rancho Valle de San Jose) and following it south down to its confluence with Arroyo de la Alameda (later location of Sunol). It then crossed the hills to the south via Mission Pass to the coastal plain and on until it reached Mission Santa Clara and the El Camino Real. The Los Angeles Area section left the El Camino Real in the San Fernando Valley, Later, after the 1797 foundation of the Mission San Jos√©, the road was turned northward from there, crossing Arroyo de San Leandro and Arroyo de San Lorenzo to the anchorage in what is now the Oakland Estuary. There cargos could be ferried across to the Mission and Presidio of San Francisco or to other places on the bay more quickly and in more quantity than carriage by road. This route along the unsettled frontier of Spanish colonial Las Californias‚ÄîAlta California (1769‚Äì1822) came to be favored by those who wished to avoid the eyes of the Spanish authorities that were along the more settled coastal route of El Camino Real. Settlements like Las Juntas and Rancho Centinela (est. 1810), and later Poso de Chane and others began to grow up along the route of El Camino Viejo. Later Californio vaqueros made \\"El Camino Viejo\\" a well-known trail that connected Rancho San Antonio with the Pueblo de Los √Ångeles. The vaqueros ran cattle and in the 1840s began establishing inland Mexican land grant ranchos along the route. Californio meste√±eros (wild horse catchers) also moved into the San Joaquin Valley to catch the meste√±os (mustangs) that now roamed in the thousands, and held them in temporary corrals before herding them to the Bay Area, to Southern California, or to Sonora and other territories of northern Mexico for sale. With the California Gold Rush a shortcut developed at the northern end of El Camino Viejo, as part of the Oakland to Stockton Road used by stagecoaches and teamsters. It ran from Oakland, east through the Castro Valley and Rancho San Ramon, to the San Joaquin Valley and Stockton.

Described by The New York Times in 1964 as \\"one of the most dominant business personalities in the western Pacific area,\\" he was best known for expanding the original San Miguel Brewery evolving into San Miguel Corporation. He also established philanthropies and encouraged good employee relations by sharing profits with his more than 16,000 employees by establishing a pension plan that paid retired employees 25% of their salary, with guaranteed sick leaves and medical benefits. He was the founder of Philippine Airlines, Asia's first air carrier. In 1935, during Commonwealth era, Soriano established Commonwealth Insurance Company, a non-life insurance company. Family Soriano was born on February 8, 1898 in San Miguel, Manila, Philippines. His father, Don Eduardo Soriano y Sanz, was a Spanish engineer who migrated to Philippines in the late 19th century. His mother, Do√±a Margarita R√≥xas de Ayala y R√≥xas, was the daughter of Pedro Pablo R√≥xas, and the granddaughter of Antonio de Ayala and Do√±a Margarita R√≥xas, progenitors of the prominent R√≥xas de Ayala and Z√≥bel de Ayala clans. Soriano was a second cousin of siblings, Col. Jacobo Z√≥bel (father of Enrique J. Zobel), Alfonso Z√≥bel de Ayala (father of Jaime Zobel de Ayala), Mercedes Z√≥bel McMicking and the artist Fernando Z√≥bel. Soriano had three siblings, including sisters, Carmen and Margarita. Soriano was married to Carmen Montemar in 1924. The couple had two sons, Jos√© Mar√≠a Soriano (born on February 6, 1925) and Andres Soriano Jr. Career =San Miguel Corporation= In 1920, the 22-year-old Soriano joined the original San Miguel Brewery as an accountant. In six months, he became acting manager. By 1924, he was its general manager, and in 1931, at the age of 33 he was elected as its president. During his incumbency, the San Miguel expanded beyond brewery and began to bottle Royal Tru-Orange and Coca-Cola, manufacture Magnolia Ice Cream and dairy products, carbonic acid, dry ice and Fleischmann's Yeast. =A. Soriano Corporation (ANSCOR)= In the 1930s, Soriano established A. Soriano Corporation (ANSCOR) as a holding company for his investments outside of San Miguel. Initially, ANSCOR concentrated on natural resources and basic industries, investing in Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, Phelps Dodge Philippines and Atlas Fertilizer Corporation. ANSCOR also went into insurance; gold mining (Antamok Mining, which together with the companies of John Hausserman and Jan Hendrik Marsman, made the Philippines second only to California as the top gold producer of the world); oil exploration (Philippine Oil Development Company, Inc.); airline (Philippine Airlines); copper mining (Atlas Consolidated); copper wire manufacture (Phelps Dodge Philippines); fertilizer from pyrite (Atlas Fertilizer); logging and lumber (Bislig Bay Lumber); paper manufacture (Paper Industries Corporation of the Philippines (PICOP)); fluorescent lamps and incandescent light bulbs (Philippine Electrical Manufacturing Company (PEMCO)); jute bags (Industrial Textiles Manufacturing Company of the Philippines, Inc. (ITEMCOP)); steel drums (Rheem Philippines); newspapers (The Philippines Herald) and broadcasting (DZTV Channel 13). Atlas Consolidated grew to be the largest copper mine of its time in the Far East and one of the ten largest copper mines in the world. Citizenship He was a Spanish citizen and leader of the Philippine Falange during the late 1930s until he applied for Filipino citizenship.Theodore Friend. Between two empires: the ordeal of the Philippines, 1929‚Äì1946. Yale University Press, 1965. Pp. 172.

Life Theoleptus was a nephew of Patriarch Metrophanes III. He became Metropolitan of Philippopolis and although he had been helped by Patriarch Jeremias II, he conspired against him, leaguing with Pachomius II. When Pachomius was deposed, Theoleptus was appointed Patriarch in his place, on 16 February 1585, and he was formally enthroned in March 1585 by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch. In May 1586, while Theoleptus was travelling in Moldavia and Wallachia to raise funds, Nicephorus (died 1596), a deacon of the exiled Patriarch Jeremias, managed to dethrone him. Nicephorus became locum tenens of the throne until April 1587, when Jeremias II was re- elected o the Patriarchate even though he was absent from Istanbul in a long travel to Ukraine and Russia. Jeremias was informed of his re-election only in 1589 in Moldova, when he was on the way back to Istanbul; he arrived there in 1590. In the meantime the deacon Nicephorus went on governing the Church in name of Jeremias. The term of Nicephorus was shortly interrupted for about ten days by the deacon Dionysios (later Metropolitan of Larissa, died 1611). After April 1587, a synodal decision pardoned Theoleptus and sent him to Iberia to raise money for the indebted Church. In 1587 Theoleptus adopted a signet for the Soumela Monastery, but it is not known whether it was lawfully or unlawfully issued. Finally, it is known that Theoleptus was reconciled with Jeremias II and that he helped the government of the Church until 1590. His fate after that is unknown. Theoleptus was the last Patriarch who had the see in the Pammakaristos Church, which was converted into a mosque in 1586. The Patriarchate moved on to the poor Church of Theotokos Paramythia (later in the precincts of the \\"Vlach Saray\\", the residence of the Valachian Hospodar in Constantinople), where it remained for eleven years, until 1597.

It is one of the first Hindu temples to be constructedSrinivasachari, Introduction, p xxix in the British settlement of Madrasapatnam. There is the nearby Chenna kesava perumal Temple. They are twin temples. This is also called Chenna Malleeswarar temple. Chenna pattanam may be named after this deities. The word 'chenni' in Tamil means face, and the temple was regarded as the face of the city.  History  Sources about the history of this temple have the following: * According to Srinivasan, T.A The Original twin temples' ( Chenna kesava perumal and Chenna Malleeswarar) location was later occupied by the High court building. The original twin temples' history dates back to 1646 CE. Grants made to the original twin temples by Nagabattar and Thimmappar were recorded. Attack by other European powers and attack and looting of temples by Hyder Ali's forces caused the devotees to relocate some vigrahams to the Thiruneermalai Temple. The twin temples were demolished by the British, for the purpose of security and expansion of the nearby Fort St.George. Manali Muthu Krishna Mudaliar, translator for Lord Piccode, built new twin temples in 1700 CE in a different location (at Devaraja mudali Street, later called Sowcarpet). He donated his lands, used his own funds to build and he refused the money from the British, accepting only land from them. * According to the official Chenna Kesava temple website: \\"The original Chenna kesava perumal Temple was located even in the 17th century AD in the place where the Madras High Court is currently located. When the original temple was present, there were a lot of problems in Chennai such as invasion by French and Tippu Sultan.The British East India Company demolished the original temple in 1757 AD. Due to public outcry, the British East India Company donated land and some money to Manali Muthu krishna Mudaliar, who built the new Chenna Kesava Perumal temple in the year of 1762, at a different location i.e. at Devaraja Mudali Street in Sowcarpet area of Chennai city. Along with this Vishnu temple, he also built a temple for Shiva - Chenna Malleeswarar temple, thus Chennai got twin temples at Sowcarpet.\\" * According to Srinivasachari.C. S, The Mallikesvarar Temple was constructed by Alanganatha Pillai, assistant chief merchant to the British East India Company, in the 17th century AD. The temple is first mentioned in a document of 1652 as \\"Mally Carjuns Old Pagoda\\". It is also believed to be the Muthialpet Pagoda depicted in a Madras map of 1710. * According to Muthiah.S, The Chennakesava Perumal Temple was constructed in 1646. * According to the Times of India article, The twin temples of Chenna Kesava and Chenna Malleeswara Swami were originally built by Beri Thimappah, the dubash who brokered the deal between Francis Day and the local chieftain for the small strip of beach that was to become the city of Madras.

Eclipse would publish some of the first graphic novels and was one of the first comics publishers to champion creators' rights. In the 2000s, he established the imprint The Library of American Comics of IDW Publishing to publish hardcover collections of comic strips. Mullaney and his work have received seven Eisner Awards. Biography Dean Mullaney and his brother, rock musician Jan Mullaney, are the sons of early electronica musician Dave Mullaney of the band Hot Butter.Gulacy, Paul (2008). Untitled, unnumbered introduction page, Sabre: 30th Anniversary Edition (Dallas, Georgia: Desperado Publishing). . The brothers founded Eclipse Enterprises in Staten Island, New York City, New York, in 1977, and the following year published one of the first original graphic novels, Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species. Written by Don McGregor and drawn by Paul Gulacy, Sabre was additionally the first graphic novel sold through the new \\"direct market\\" of comic-book stores. Eclipse went on to publish the anthology magazine Eclipse and the color-comic anthology Eclipse Monthly, the first of an Eclipse Comics line that eventually included such titles and creators as The Rocketeer by Dave Stevens; Zot! by Scott McCloud; two Detectives Inc. graphic novels by McGregor and artists Marshall Rogers and Gene Colan, respectively; the graphic novel Stewart the Rat by writer Steve Gerber and artists Colan and Tom Palmer; and the U.S. reprints of Miracleman by Alan Moore. Eclipse also brought out graphic novels featuring opera adaptations, such as The Magic Flute by P. Craig Russell, and children's literature such as The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. In the early 1980s, Mullaney met writer-editor Catherine Yronwode, who was working for cartoonist and entrepreneur Will Eisner. Yronwode recalled that Eisner and his wife Ann \\"hosted a party for me with all these comic book men I was flirting with. All these men came up; they all wanted to meet Will. One of them was Dean Mullaney, the co-owner of Eclipse Comics, a small independent publishing house. He was the most flirtatious.\\" At some point afterward, once Yronwode finished her work organizing Eisner's archives, she and Mullaney became engaged and moved to California, where they were married. By the late 1980s, Eclipse was selling a half-million comics a month, and was the third largest comics publisher after Marvel Comics and DC Comics. In 1986, Eclipse lost most of its back-issue stock in a flood. This event, along with the repercussions of Mullaney's divorce from Yronwode, by then his partner at Eclipse, and the mid-1990s collapse of the direct market distribution system, caused the company to cease operations in 1994, and file for bankruptcy in 1995. The company's intellectual property rights were later acquired by Todd McFarlane. Mullaney also attributed the company's demise to a problematic contract with the book publisher HarperCollins. Eclipse's last publication was its Spring 1993 catalog, which was a complete bibliography of its publications. In the mid-2000s, Mullaney approached IDW Publishing with a proposal to publish hardcover reprints of American comic strips. This became the IDW imprint The Library of American Comics, which debuted with the 2007 book The Complete Terry and the Pirates, Vol. 1: 1934-1936, by Milton Caniff. As Mullaney described, \\"Terry's always been my favorite strip, and I was going to publish it in the early '80s (through Eclipse Comics), but Terry Nantier at NBM beat me to it. Luckily, I've lived long enough so that 25 years later I'm in a position to release new editions of Terry. With Mullaney as its creative director, the imprint has gone on to publish collections of strips including Dick Tracy, Little Orphan Annie, Bringing Up Father, Family Circus, and Bloom County.The Library of American Comics (official site). Mullaney listed as creative director at site's \\"About\\" page In 2014, Mullaney added another imprint at IDW, EuroComics, in order to publish new English translations of European comics, including Hugo Pratt‚Äôs Corto Maltese, Paracuellos by Carlos Gim√©nez, and Alack Sinner by Mu√±oz and Sampaya.

History and description The English Cemetery in M√°laga, where St George‚Äôs Anglican Church stands, is the result of the inspiration and concern of William Mark, who was British Consul in M√°laga from 1824 until 1836. In the eight years he had lived in M√°laga before his appointment as Consul, he had looked ‚Äúwith great disgust‚Äù on the way Protestants had to be buried on the sea shore at dead of night, because those who professed a creed other than Catholicism could not be buried in consecrated ground, namely in the parish churches, monasteries and cemeteries of M√°laga. Due to his persistent efforts, Mark was finally given permission to create a permanent cemetery on the V√©lez road outside the walls of the city, thanks to the Royal Order of Ferdinand VII, issued on 11 April 1830. The adjoining mortuary is now the church library. During the years immediately after 1830, the cemetery was greatly extended, and in 1839‚Äì40 a ‚Äúlodge temple‚Äù was built in classical style with a small chapel and incorporating the cemetery guard‚Äôs dwelling. With its fine Doric columns, this structure was adapted and enlarged in 1890‚Äì91 to become the present St George‚Äôs Anglican Church. In 1856, a gatehouse was constructed in Gothic style at the entrance to the cemetery. The cemetery covers over 8,000 sq. m. and contains more than 1,000 graves. The cemetery is also a botanical garden with a number of unusual specimens of trees and plants. With several well-known people buried there, it has become one of M√°laga's historical sites. In 2005 the cemetery gatehouse, for many years the home of the cemetery gardener, was renovated and now houses a small Visitors' Centre and gift shop as well as providing space for St George‚Äôs Church lunches and other activities. The Gatehouse is staffed by volunteers, mainly from the church, and is providing a modest but steady income for both the church and the cemetery. Ownership and management From its inception, the cemetery was the property of the British Government. However, no funds had been provided for its upkeep for many years. After several years' work, formal registration of the English Cemetery in M√°laga Foundation was granted on 13 July 2010. The Foundation is now responsible for the management of the cemetery. Its Board comprises three Spaniards, three Britons, one German and one Italian, and includes three members of St George's Church. (The church is administered by the Chaplaincy). The President of the Board is a former British Consul in M√°laga.

However the character's legacy still remains as the character has appeared on the front cover of The Beano and Dandy books and has appeared in the longer The Bash Street Kids stories by Kev F Sutherland. She reappeared in the 2013 Dandy Annual drawn by Laura Howell. Keyhole Kate then moved to the Dandy's online version of the comic. In this version, she is a Nancy Drew- esque reporter for the school newspaper. She appears in Dandy Annuals, drawn by Lew Stringer since 2013, starting with Dandy Annual 2014 and currently scripts it as well.

A production unit relating to the sector was created in 1991 to crush and market copra procured from the farmers at remunerative price to relieve the section of price crunch and to cater the edible oil requirement of the society by maintaining high quality standards. During the financial year 2009‚Äì2010, KERAFED procured 24,500 metric tonnes of copra for its operations.

It was notable for building two large aircraft, the Sundstedt-Hannevig transatlantic seaplane with a 100-foot wingspan and the NBL-1 Barling Bomber a six-engined triplane with a 120-foot wingspan. Early years The company had been formed at Staten Island, New York in 1906 by Charles and Adolph Wittemann as Wittemann Aeronautical Engineers. The first aircraft built was a Wright pusher biplane in 1907, unusual for the time it had a swivelling tail wheel. A series of Wright pusher triplanes were built between 1908 and 1914 for a number of notable aviators. In 1911 they built a number of Hall-Scott pusher biplanes for Thomas Baldwin, known as the Baldwin Red Devil for the red-doped covering. Between 1913 and 1914 they built several Curtis-type biplanes. Around 1917 Adolph Wittemann left the company and Charles was joined by Samuel Lewis and they became the Wittemann-Lewis Aircraft Company and moved to a new factory in Teterboro in New Jersey. During 1918 the factory was used to build the twin-engined Sundstedt-Hannevig Seaplane for an attempt by Captain Sundstedt on the Daily Mail ¬£10,000 prize for the first transatlantic crossing. The seaplane crashed during a test flight in February 1919 and was not repaired. Also produced in 1918 was the Wittemann-Lewis Training Tractor (sometime known as the Wittemann-Lewis T-T) a two-seat training biplane. In 1921 the company was contracted to build two NBL-1 Barling Bombers for the Engineering Division of the United States Army. The NBL-1 was a large six-engined triplane bomber which was shipped by train and assembled at Wright Field. In 1923 the company modified 25 de Havilland DH.4s for the United States Post Office as mail carriers, they would be the last aircraft produced by the company which then concentrated on engineering research but in 1924 it was declared bankrupt.

Duarte was born in Antwerp, the son of Gaspar Duarte I, a Christian diamond and art dealer of Jewish descent in Antwerp, who was befriended with e.g. Constantijn Huygens. Gaspar was the son of Diego Duarte I, and was born in 1584 in Antwerp. He later became the consul of Portugal in Antwerp. In 1635, Diego was appointed \\"jeweller in ordinary\\" by Charles I of England, but he returned to Antwerp in 1642. He received a part of the art collection of his father on his death in 1653, and continued collecting throughout his life. Part of his collection was sold in Amsterdam in 1682. Diego had a long correspondence and friendship with Constantijn Huygens, Jr.. The house of the Duarte's in Antwerp was called the Antwerp Parnassus, a meeting place for intellectuals to enjoy art and music. William III of England repeatedly stayed at the house between 1674 and 1678. Diego's brother Gaspar Duarte II was an art collector as well, and his sister Leonora was a composer. After the childless death of Diego Duarte in 1691, no Duartes remained in Antwerp. Some 200 paintings of Diego's collection were inherited by his nephew Manuel Levy Duarte. Most were sold between 1693 and 1696.

Kuriapilly was a border of Travancore kingdom in the British India, the name Kuriapilly is old up to 500 years, even in the letters of Tippu Sultan we can see the name Kuriapilly. Now it is in state of Kerala. The village is 22 km away from Kochi, most developed city of Kerala. The ancient seaport of India, Muziris is located in Pattanam village 0.7 km away from this. Overview The various denominations of modern Saint Thomas Christians ascribe their unwritten tradition to the end of the 2nd century and believe that Thomas landed at Maliankara near Madaplathuruth village in Paravur Taluk in AD 52. Olden times Madaplathuruth was known for coir products and handloom clothes. But nowadays it is well known by the marble and granite showrooms.

During the time of Tippu Sultan's attack Travencoor King created a big fake fort using the Bamboo, Araknut Tree and bitumen. Tippu's army misleaded and they spend their large time to destroy the fort using howitzer. Tippu Sultan had fort in Kottapuram,ruins of the fort still there. During the time of digging in Kuriappilly still people getting the shells of old war. One small stream named \\"Vadathodu\\" is flowing towards the Periyar river, which was once an International boundary separating the Kingdom of Cochin from the Travancore Kingdom. On its west lay Travancore (Madaplathuruthu and Moothakunnam), and on its east was Kingdom of Cochin (Vadakkumpuram and, of course, Chendamangalam where Paliath Achan, the Cochin Kingdom's minister lived). So goes one story: a thief, chased by the police of one kingdom, crossed Vadathodu over to the other kingdom, and escaped; the police had to simply watch on helplessly. International borders didn't matter for thieves, but did for the police. Geography Kuriappilly is located at 10.09¬∞ N 76.12¬∞ E[1]. It has an average elevation of 4 metres (12 feet). The village is situated at north end of Ernakulam district. The town Kodungallore.

Their exact location is still unknown, although two proposals are, first, that it might be the source of the name of the Belgian village of Geetbets, and second, that it might be further east, nearer to the Sunuci with whom they interacted in the Batavian revolt, and to the Cugerni who lived at Xanten. The area of Gennep, Goch and Geldern has been proposed for example.  Etymology  The name Baetasii could stem from the Proto-Celtic root *baidos ('wild boar'; compare with Welsh baedd). The suffix -asio- is rather common in the Gaulish language, whereas it has hardly any connection with Germanic.  History  As with many of the tribal groups of Germania Inferior, such as the Toxandrians, and Tungrii, the origins of the tribe are unknown, but it is likely that their ancestry included a mixture of older populations and Germanic immigrants from the east of the Rhine who had been arriving for generations. Germania Inferior was on the west of the Rhine and had been described by Julius Caesar, at the time of Roman conquest of the area, as part of Belgic Gaul. Many of the tribal names and personal names which he reported from this area, are considered to be Celtic, not Germanic. However already long before his time there appears to have been an influx of people coming from the east of the Rhine, including, in the particular area where the Betasii lived, the tribal grouping which Tacitus later claimed to be the original tribal group which had been called \\"Germani\\", the so-called \\"Germani Cisrhenani\\".Tacitus, Germania, II 2. ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum, quoniamqui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, nongentis, evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore obmetum, mox et a se ipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur. Whether these original Germani had all spoken a Germanic language is unknown. Caesar and Tacitus were more interested in the fact that tribes from the east of the Rhine, who all eventually came to be referred to as Germani, were less softened by civilization, and therefore difficult to defeat in battle or incorporate into the Roman empire. Some specific tribes who entered the empire later, such as the Ubii who lived on the west bank of the Rhine, are understood to be speakers of Germanic languages, and records exist concerning their immigration and settlement. However for the Betasii, there is no such clear record and it is their position which generally leads to them being understood as being a group settled during imperial times, and Germanic in the modern sense of speaking a Germanic language. It has been proposed that like their neighbours the Cugerni, they descend from the Sicambri, who were already actively jumping to this side of the Rhine in Caesar's time, and who Strabo records as living in this area. On the other hand there have been suggestions that they might represent the descendants, at least partly, of the Germani tribes described by Caesar as having been in this region since at least the 2nd century BCE when the Cimbri moved through the area. In the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder places the Betasi in his list of tribes in this region in between the Frisiabones and the Leuci, but this may not indicate position in any meaningful way. They contributed troops to the Roman military, including some who are known to have been stationed in Britain. Tacitus also mentioned the Betasii, as a people of this region during the Batavian revolt. Some of them joined Claudius Labeo, who held a bridge over the Meuse, with a force of Betasii, Tungri and Nervii.Tacitus, Histories (Tacitus) 4.66 For this reason, it is often thought that the Betasii lived close to the Tungri and Nervii, and possibly near the river Meuse (Dutch Maas, Latin Mosa). Amongst evidence of Betasii from inscriptions made concerning soldiers, the Betasii are often mentioned as \\"Traianenses Baetasii\\", which has been taken as evidence that the Betasii, like the Cugerni (or Cuberni) lived in the northeastern \\"Civitas Traiana\\" with its capital near modern Xanten. Xanten itself was the area where the Cugerni lived and was on the Rhine border, so this would put the Betasii one step away from the Rhine. Geetbets, in contrast, would have been in the Civitas Tungrorum. Joining the military was eventually a way to become a Roman citizen, and by early 2nd century CE the inscriptions show that the soldiers referred to their origin as \\"Traianenses Baetasii\\", replacing their exclusive tribal affiliation with a new Roman identity. Like other peoples in the northern part of Germania Inferior, what happened to them in the later part of the Roman era is uncertain. Archaeological and other evidence agrees that the area was largely de-populated apart from military positions along the Rhine. It became the home of new groups who crossed the Rhine, especially the Sallii. These became part of the amalgamation of tribes known as the Franks. They united under kings, and became dominant in northern Germania Inferior, giving it an older name, Toxandria. They later became semi-independent within the empire, started moving into more populated Romanized areas to their south, and then proceeded to conquer a large part of Western Europe which became the Holy Roman empire. If any of the Betasii remained in the area, they became part of this development.  Religion  Votive stones dedicated to the deity Hercules Magusanus were found on the territory of the Baetasii.

It was later released as a downloadable title on the Nintendo eShop in late 2012. Like earlier Mario Tennis titles, Mario Tennis Open incorporates characters, settings, and scenarios from the Mario franchise. Players can engage in standard tennis matches but also play special variants with different rules and objectives. Twenty-four distinct playable characters are available, each with special qualities that are used to the players' advantage. Mario Tennis Open is also the first Mario Tennis game to feature simultaneous online play. Mario Tennis Open received mixed to positive reviews, gaining aggregate scores of 69.54% on GameRankings and 69 on Metacritic.  Gameplay  Mario and Yoshi playing against Luigi and Daisy in a doubles match. The player can choose to execute different shots using button presses or by selecting them from the Nintendo 3DS touchscreen, as shown. Mario Tennis Open features variants of tennis matches, played either in singles or doubles. Different shots (lobs, slices, and dropshots) can be executed with different button combinations or by selecting them from the Nintendo 3DS touch screen. In addition, the player can use the 3DS gyroscope to turn the in-game camera by rotating the entire console during gameplay. Mario Tennis Open does not feature any RPG elements, unlike the previous handheld games Mario Tennis and Mario Tennis: Power Tour. Mario Tennis Open features twenty-four playable Mario characters, with four being unlocked by accomplishing specific tasks, and eight more being unlocked by scanning certain QR codes. Each character possesses a pre-determined skill, such as advantages in speed, offense, or defense. Mii characters saved in the Nintendo 3DS Mii Maker are also selectable. Unlike the Mario characters, Mii characters' skills vary and are customizable, determined by the tennis gear the player equips. The gear options are purchased using coins that are awarded after playing each game mode. However, costumes are obtained by completing certain objectives. Mario Tennis Open supports both online and local wireless multiplayer, allowing up to four players to play simultaneously on separate Nintendo 3DS consoles. When a player's Nintendo 3DS console comes in contact with another via StreetPass, he will be able to play against a computer-controlled opponent whose play style mimics that of the other player, provided that the other console also contains Mario Tennis Open save data.

She received her MD (cand.med.) in 2007. During her time at University she worked with sexual awareness information for youths (Medisinernes Seksualopplysning) as well as an expert panelist on NRKs radio program Juntafil, a show with 250 000 listeners that answers young Norwegians sometimes very explicit sexual questions. Stordalen also worked as a model during her time at University In 2007 Stordalen enrolled in the PhD program at the Institute of Pathology Oslo University Hospital (Rikshospitalet) and in 2010 defended her doctoral thesis Molecular studies on bone with focus on fracture healing in experimental osteoporosis in the field of pathology and orthopedics. Environmentalism The Stordalen Foundation, which she co-founded with her husband Petter Stordalen in 2011, focuses primarily on climate change and Stordalen has written several op-eds on the subject. The Stordalen foundation focuses on 4 separate areas: * The Rainforest Foundation * Zero Emission Resource Organisation (ZERO): The Stordalen foundation supports the non-profit environmental organization Zero. Stordalen serves on the Board of Directors of the organization. * European Climate Foundation: The foundation supports the European Climate Foundation (ECF) and Stordalen serves on the organization's supervisory committee. * GreeNudge: In June 2011 the couple founded GreeNudge, a non-profit initiative that will initiate and support behavioral research related to energy efficiency and climate change, in order to provide evidence- based data as a basis for decision makers to implement effective climate policies. Stordalen is an Earth Hour ambassador for Norway. =Animal Welfare= Stordalen is also an advocate for animal rights and refused to do an interview with Elle until they changed their policy on their use of fur and has spoken out against the fur industry on several occasions,Niels Christian Geelmuyden, Kapital, June 2011 she has also contributed at catwalk shows for the Norwegian Animal Welfare Alliance. =Women's health= As the spokesperson of the Norwegian Heart and Lung Patient Organization (LHL), she campaigned to raise awareness of heart conditions affecting women. She has also educated the public on numerous occasions about the subject of her thesis, osteoporosis. EAT Foundation In 2013, Stordalen founded the EAT Initiative with the idea of transforming the global food system to ensure the growing population a healthy and nutritious diet within safe environmental limits. In 2014, together with the Stordalen Foundation and the Stockholm Resilience Center she hosted the first EAT Stockholm Food Forum, dealing with the connection between food, health and sustainability..Kungahuset - Prince Daniel and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway attend the EAT Stockholm Food Forum The participants included Charles, Prince of Wales, who spoke via a link on the theme of 'The global food system: A sustainable future', former US President Bill Clinton, who gave the keynote speech, and Professor Hans Rosling. Prince Daniel, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland and Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of NorwayKungahuset - Prince Daniel and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway attend the EAT Stockholm Food Forum took part in a discussion from a consumer perspective on food and health. Following this, the Wellcome Trust joined Stockholm Resilience Center and the Stordalen Foundation in launching the independent EAT Foundation in March 2016. This enabled the EAT Stockholm Food Forum to become an annual event. To broaden its reach and spread the message, EAT Foundation, for the first time, organized a food forum outside of Stockholm, namely in Jakarta, Indonesia in October 2017. Illness On 22 October 2014 Stordalen was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis and has since been undergoing treatment for the disease.http://www.aftenposten.no/amagasinet/Gunhild-Stordalen---Jeg-er-sa- takknemlig-for-at-jeg-overlevde-7958275.html Recognitions and Directorships In 2012 Stordalen was named the youngest woman on Kapital's annual list over the 100 most influential women of Norway.

This building is marked as Mokotowskie Gate at the map above, in the centre of the image, at the left edge). Lubomirski Ramparts () was a 12 kilometre-long earthwork surrounding the city of Warsaw in late 18th and 19th century. A line of earthworks with a dry moat separated the city of Warsaw from the countryside. Erected by Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski, the then Grand Marshal of the Crown, in 1770, it was intended as a sanitary measure to stop plague epidemics ravaging Central Europe at that time. Travellers were allowed to enter the city only through several breaches in the ramparts dubbed rogatki. The term later entered the Polish language to signify any kind of toll house. The plague indeed missed Warsaw and the ramparts became the boundary of the city of Warsaw for the next century. The line was also used for tax purposes, as all goods entering the city were taxed. In 1794 the ramparts were partially strengthened to include military keeps and played some role in the defence of Warsaw against a joint Russian and Prussian siege of the city in the summer of that year. Around 1825 the president of Warsaw ordered the ramparts to be levelled and replaced with city streets. Their previous location still defined the city limits though. The line of former Lubomirski Ramparts also defined the inner line of the city's defences during the 1831 Battle of Warsaw. It was only in 1916 when areas outside of the Lubomirski Ramparts were incorporated into the city. The former line of ramparts is commemorated by a number of streets with the Polish name of Okopy, including Okopowa Street, where a large Jewish Cemetery is located.

Troemel is most well known for his development of the Tumblr website The Jogging which has received attention for its work in post internet art. Education Brad Troemel received a BA in Visual Critical Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. For his thesis, he wrote a twenty- page essay titled \\"Free Art\\" which used arguments by Wired editor Chris Anderson to envision a radical techno-libertarian conception of how the Internet can circumvent the traditional art world. He received an MFA from New York University NYU Steinhardt. Work In 2008, Troemel launched the website On The Make with curator Karly Wildenhaus. That year, Troemel opened the Chicago-based art gallery Scott Projects. Starting in 2009, Troemel, along with artist Lauren Christiansen, began digitally compositing images that depicted irreverent installation scenes and sculptures on the Tumblr website The Jogging. Jogging concluded with months of polarizing conspiracy images made by Troemel and the artist Edward Shenk, what critic Zachary Kaplan called \\"a body of image macros that took on the look and feel of Truther and right- wing, anti-Obama propaganda while simultaneously subverting it through absurdist content.\\" In 2011 Troemel began a series of exhibitions with his use of Bitcoin and the Silk Road black market. For the exhibition \\"The Social Life of Things\\" in Rotterdam, Troemel used a number of objects from the marketplace including a Fake ID containing his real details and picture, bump keys and psychedelic drug seeds which were presented in an installation. Those objects were presented for free to be further used by visitors and Troemel himself used Silk Road-purchased identification to travel from New York to Rotterdam for the exhibition. In 2012, Troemel launched an Etsy store primarily featuring temporary food sculptures designed to fall apart during their shipment through the postal service. Troemel's 2014 exhibition Live/Work at Tomorrow Gallery featured a series of hanging colored ant tanks, each indicative of a different trio of charities. The run of the exhibition served as a competition between the various ant tanks to see which could most productively dig the most tunnels, earning the charity that the ants represented 10% of the exhibitions' proceeds. In 2015 Troemel partnered with Joshua Citarella, a former collaborator from Jogging, to create UV Production House, an Etsy store providing material kits and fabrication guidance to collectors for all-original works. In 2016 exhibition \\"Freecaching\\", Troemel concealed his entire studio inventory in Central Park and presented GPS coordinates as magnetic puzzle certificates of authenticity at Tomorrow Gallery. He described, the exhibition was meant to be a proof of concept for discretely utilizing public space as a sharing economy art storage business model. In early 2020, Troemel released a satirical 'advertisement' for the Joe Biden campaign with the caption \\"His brain? No, his heart.\\" The satirical piece went viral, being shared by both left-and right-wing users who at times were not aware of its satirical origins. The piece was later taken down by Twitter and other platforms as fake news.

Life He was born at Glan Clwyd in Aberwheeler, near Denbigh, on 14 November 1750. His father, a farmer of good position, sent him to St. Asaph grammar school, and he was intended for the Church of England. But while still young he came under the influence of the Methodists of the district; and, while studying with a curate at Derwen (David Ellis, who translated several books into Welsh), attended their meetings. He joined the Independent church at Denbigh, began to preach, and in 1771 entered the dissenting academy at Abergavenny. His first pastoral charge was at Ross- on-Wye, where he was minister from 1775 to 1777, when he moved on to Oswestry. Williams married Mary Llewellyin on 28 July 1777. In 1781, he was invited by Lady Glenorchy to train two students in her house at her expense. He began to do this. When Dr. Benjamin Davies left Abergavenny for Homerton College, it was suggested that Williams come to Abergavenny as his successor. Williams chose not to leave Oswestry, and so the academy was moved in May 1782 to Oswestry, and placed under Williams's care. At the end of 1791 he gave up both church and academy, and, with the new year, commenced his ministry at Carr's Lane, Birmingham. In 1792 he was appointed first editor of the Evangelical Magazine and received the degree of D.D. from the University of Edinburgh. As early as 1793, Williams wrote a letter to the Midlands churches expressing the need for world evangelization and foreign missions. It was an effective letter. Williams became involved in plans to form a missionary society. The society was formed in 1795 and subsequently took the name London Missionary Society. In July 1796, it was Edwards who preached the charge when the society sent out its first missionaries.Wadsworth, KW Yorkshire United Independent College London: Independent Press 1954 Williams left Birmingham in September 1795, becoming minister to the Masbrough Independent Chapel, Rotherham and also theological tutor at the nearby newly formed Rotherham Academy. Williams' first wife had died on 22 July 1795, shortly before Williams left Birmingham. She left Williams with five children, four other children having died. He married Miss Yeomans of Worcester during 1796. They had one child, Edward Williams. Edward senior died at Rotherham on 9 March 1813, aged 62. His second wife survived until 1823. Williams had helped found the London Missionary Society and also the West Riding Itinerant Society, as well as tutoring in several academies and being the first tutor at the Masbrough academy, spreading the light of the Gospel at home and abroad. More than fifty years later, Dr FJ Falding, a later principal at Rotherham, described him as a great theologian. Works He was known as the advocate of a moderate form of Calvinism, expounded in his book on the ‚ÄòEquity of Divine Government‚Äô (London, 1813).

Currently he is the president of Yonekura Boxing Gym. Amateur career Yonekura saw the United States Armed Forces' boxing fights in Itazuke Air Base, that was his first encounter with boxing. Yonekura began boxing at the age of a high school student. He was training and sparring with Yoshio Shirai under Alvin Rober Cahn's guidance. Yonekura won the All-Japan Amateur Boxing Championships in the flyweight division in 1956, and represented Japan at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, while studying at Meiji University. He won on points over Phachon Muangson in the second round match, and lost on points to Ren√© Libeer in the quarterfinals. He also participated in the Seattle Golden Gloves in 1957, and compiled an amateur record of 71‚Äì7 (19 KOs) before turning professional. Professional career Yonekura made his professional debut under his real name Kenji Yonekura, written as Á±≥ÂÄâ ÂÅ•Ê≤ª, in an eight-round bout in June 1958. Before his official debut, he made an exhibition match against the Japanese flyweight champion Sadao Yaoita as a welcome bout for the NBA's public relations manager. He was awarded with Japan's Fight of the Year and Technical Award in his debut year. His ring name was changed into Á±≥ÂÄâ ÂÅ•Âøó, pronounced the same, during his professional career. He captured the vacant Japanese flyweight title in January 1959. His first world title shot against Pascual P√©rez in the flyweight division, which was postponed three days due to rain, ended in a unanimous decision loss after being knocked down in the second round, in front of 9,000 spectators at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium in August 1959. However, as Yonekura had been highly expected to be the winner of it as a former Olympian, its audience rating was 88.0 percent. Yonekura was featured on the front covers of not only boxing-related such as (Japan's) Boxing Gazette, Puroresu & Boxing and Weekly Sports: Fight, but also various magazines such as Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine, Weekly Yomiuri Sports, Weekly Sankei Sports and Olympic Gah≈ç, as a handsome superstar. Yonekura moved up in weight division to capture the OPBF bantamweight title in January 1960. In his second world title shot in the bantamweight division in May of that year, he lost to Jos√© Becerra via a split decision while being watched by 17,000 spectators at the Korakuen Baseball Stadium. From 1960 through 1961, he made an expedition to Mexico and fought four times in Tijuana and Mexico City, but was defeated in all those fights. After defending the OPBF title four times, he lost on points in his fifth defense in October 1962, and hung up his gloves. Recent activities After his retirement as a boxer, he opened Yonekura Boxing Gym in Tokyo in 1963, and acts as its president, promoter, manager, and trainer. He also served as the president of Japan Pro Boxing Association (JPBA) for three years from 1986 to 1989. Yonekura Boxing Gym has so far brought up fifty champions including five world champions i.e. Kuniaki Shibata, Guts Ishimatsu, Shigeo Nakajima, Hideyuki Ohashi and Hiroshi Kawashima.

His award-winning research within marketing, creativity and consumer behavior has been published in four books and numerous journal articles. Dahl√©n's books have reached a global audience, rights being sold to countries such as the U.S, U.K, Germany, South Korea, Russia and Brazil. In 2013 Dahl√©n stated in an interview that he was writing a novel. Academic career Dahl√©n earned his PhD in 2001 from the Economic Research Institute at Stockholm School of Economics. Dahl√©ns PhD thesis, \\"Marketing on the Web: empirical studies of advertising and promotion effectiveness\\", challenged the traditional logic of Web advertising and suggested that Internet marketing could be much more effective if designed and evaluated differently. As a researcher, Dahl√©n rose rapidly to take up a leading position in the field of consumer behavior, creativity and marketing. Only 34 years old he was made Professor. In the same year, 2008, Journal of Advertising ranked Dahl√©n as number 10 in the world among researchers within the field of advertising. Dahl√©n has also established the full-semester specialization course called Marketing Communication XL at Stockholm School of Economics. Writing Dahl√©n has written six books on diverse topics such as marketing, happiness, serial-killers and social media which have been translated into a number of languages. Creativity Unlimited: Thinking Inside the Box for Business Innovations Dahl√©n's first public success was the book \\"Creativity Unlimited: Thinking Inside the Box for Business Innovations\\", in which he book suggested that we do not need to 'think outside the box' in our quest for creativity, rather we should rethink the way we look 'inside the box'. The book was praised for \\"demystifying the process of creativity\\". Nextopia In the book \\"Nextopia\\" Dahl√©n states that we live in an expectation society, a society where we are constantly striving towards our next job, the next big thing, the next date. We are striving towards a Nextopia that holds the promise that our greatest pleasures and adventures lie ahead. With a set of ideas and theories about sex, drugs and rock 'n roll as natural expressions of human nature, Dahl√©n explains how this change in society and human mind impacts companies' and their ways of working, as well as how it impacts us as individuals. Monster In his latest book \\"Monster\\" Dahl√©n chose a topic differing from his previous work: Serial-killers and the human fascination for evil. Dahl√©n travelled across the globe to interview famous murderers, such as Charles Manson and the Japanese cannibal Issei Sagawa. The goal was to answer the question of how killing another person can make someone an international superstar, admired by millions? Dahl√©n also conducted several studies of his own on, i.e. how people perceive murderers and how many murders, fictional or real, that a person is exposed to on an average day. Dahl√©n also coined the term \\"Mansonomics\\" to describe how people, not only the murderers themselves, profit from these horrible acts.

He is an alumnus of the Komazawa University. Nakajima began boxing at Yonekura Boxing Gym at the age of a high school student. He compiled an amateur record of 80‚Äì15 (48 KOs) before turning professional. Nakajima made his professional debut with a second-round knockout victory at the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo in July 1976, and won over the reigning Japanese junior flyweight champion Kazunori Tenry≈´ via a third-round knockout in a non-title ten round bout in August 1977. However, he was knocked out by the former WBA flyweight champion Bernabe Villacampo with a body blow in the fourth round in March 1978. He lost on points to the future WBA junior flyweight champion Hwan-Jin Kim in August of that year. On January 3, 1980, Nakajima fought against Kim Sung-Jun for the WBC junior flyweight title at the Korakuen Hall. Preparing for that fight, Joe Koizumi who is familiar with the boxing theory and was later inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame, served as Nakajima's trainer. The gym's president Kenji Yonekura made him move to an apartment near his residence, and woke him up every morning to make him do his roadwork. In the third round, his eardrum was perforated and his ribs cracked, and he suffered a cut above his left eye. Nevertheless, Nakajima was crowned the title via a unanimous decision with his quick blows and footwork. In his first defense in March 1980, he lost to Hilario Zapata via a close unanimous decision at the Kuramae Kokugikan in Tokyo. Yonekura protested that decision of the judges. Yet Nakajima was stopped in the eleventh round of the rematch with Zapata for that title at the Civic Center in Gifu city in September of the same year. After eight months, Nakajima suffered an eight-round knockout loss, and quit boxing. Nakajima once serves as the president of the golf course development company, and currently acts as the executive secretary of the Pro Boxing World Champions party which is the internal organization of the Japan Pro Boxing Association (JPBA) consisting of Japan's world champions for the social contributions.

His initial style was akin to Impressionism but moved into abstraction as the influence of Piet Mondrian and Wassily Kandinsky became more important to him. From 1946 on he used collage techniques. In 1947 he was introduced to artists Arnau Puig Grau, Joan Pon√ß, Modest Cuixart, Antoni T√†pies, Joan Brossa and Josep Vicen√ß Foix at the Institut Fran√ßais in Barcelona. With some of these artists he founded the group Dau al Set, which published the magazine of the same name, printed in his atelier. He was one of the most visible artists in the local avantgarde art of the post-war years. His style evolved from lineal abstraction influenced by surrealism (during his Dau al Set years) towards Art Informel working with texture, color and graphism. His work also includes a variety of posters, books, murals, stained glass, mosaics, jewelry and opera scenography. Tamb√© va fer cartells, il¬∑lustr√† llibres i va fer murals, vitralls, mosaics, joies i fins i tot escenografies d'√≤pera (Spleen de 1984). He had an individual exhibition in 1949 at the El Jard√≠n gallery in Barcelona and became one of the most important Catalan artists in the international scene. From 1954 onwards he became a fixture of the Sala Gaspar in Barcelona and from 1955 in Stockholm and New York City. In 1959 his work was exhibited at the 5th S√£o Paulo Biennale and at the Venice Biennale of 1960 and 1964. In 1966 he founded the Associaci√≥ d'Artistes Actuals. In 2000, Tharrats himself collaborated with monumental and small oil paintings in his last exhibition which was organized by Galeria Ta√ºll of Barcelona. In 2009, an important traveling exhibition called \\"Les maculatures de Tharrats\\" was arranged by the Cultural Department of the Diputaci√≥ de Barcelona. ¬´L'√Ärea de cultura de la Diputaci√≥ de Barcelona ofereix als municipis dues noves exposicions de Arranz Bravo i Joan Josep Tharrets¬ª.

He is an alumnus of the Kinki University. Muguruma became interested in boxing at the age of a junior high school student. In high school, he belonged to the rugby club. As Muguruma was a slow runner, he was a substitute player there. He began boxing at Osaka Teiken Boxing Gym after entering the University. Muguruma turned professional with an amateur record of 2‚Äì1 (1 KO), and made his debut with a second-round knockout victory on April 9, 1981. He won the annual Japanese boxing series, All-Japan Rookie King Tournament in the featherweight division in February 1982. He went down a weight division to capture the Japanese super bantamweight title in November 1983, and defended that title seven times in total before returning it. Muguruma dropped down one more weight class for the scheduled fight against Bernardo Pi√±ango for the WBA bantamweight title. However, as Pi√±ango gave up the title, Muguruma won over Panama's Azael Moran via a fifth-round knockout after flooring him twice, to capture the vacant WBA bantamweight title in Moriguchi, Osaka on March 29, 1987. In his first defense against Chan-Yong Park in Moriguchi on May 24 of that year, Muguruma was knocked down from an accidental head butt in the third round. Although Muguruma was given a two-minute rest, he could not recover from the damage until he was stopped in the eleventh round. In September of the same year, Muguruma was tied on points with Wilfredo V√°zquez in the fight for the WBA bantamweight title at the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium. Muguruma moved back a weight class to fight against Juan Jos√© Estrada for the WBA super bantamweight title in Moriguchi in October 1988. However he suffered an eleventh round stoppage with the towel thrown in, after being floored in the fourth and eleventh rounds, and hung up his gloves. Subsequently, he joined Mizuno Corporation. From 2008, he was responsible for the production of the focus mitt.

Built on the orders of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) to serve as the residence of Crown Prince Vajirunhis, the palace later became part of Chulalongkorn University but was later demolished to make way for the construction of Suphachalasai Stadium. The palace became known as such to foreign residents of Bangkok due to its partial resemblance to Windsor Castle, though it was also known to locals as Wang Klang Thung or Wang Mai. History Windsor Palace was commissioned by King Chulalongkorn in 1881 to serve as the residence of his eldest son, Prince Vajirunhis, who would later be named the first Crown Prince of Siam (Thailand). The palace was located on Sa Pathum Road (now Rama I Road) at the current location of Suphachalasai Stadium. Designed in Gothic Revival style by the Italian architect Joachim Grassi, its appearance reflects that of Windsor Castle in England, and the palace became known to contemporary expatriates as Windsor. Locals called the palace Wang Klang Thung (), lit. palace in the field, for its location, or Wang Mai (), which means new palace. The latter name in turn gave rise to Wang Mai Subdistrict, which is part of Pathum Wan District and covers the area where the palace was located. The palace had three main storeys and a central staircase, was built with imported marble, and internal decorations included neoclassical columns and statues. Illustration of Windsor Palace from the 19 September 1891 issue of The Graphic The palace's foundation stone was laid in November 1881, and construction was completed in July 1884. However, Prince Vajirunhis continued to live in the Grand Palace and had not moved into his new home when he died in 1895. Following the prince's death, the palace was used as a school of cartography, and later on, agriculture. When King Vajiravudh (Rama VI, who succeeded King Chulalongkorn) established the Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn (later to become Chulalongkorn University) in 1911, ownership of the palace was transferred to the college and the palace became the seat of the college's School of Mechanical Sciences. In 1916 the college campuses were consolidated, and Windsor Palace served as the centre of the Prathum Wan Campus (which by now also hosted the Public Administration and Education Departments) while a new Administration Building (now the Faculty of Arts Building) was being constructed. With the formal establishment of Chulalongkorn University in 1917, Windsor Palace became the seat of the Faculty of Arts and Science. The building was modified to hold classes and laboratories, with a cadaver dissection lab built nearby. It was also here at the palace that Prince Mahidol Adulyadej instructed medical students in pre-clinical courses. Four student dormitories were built near the palace building, and later became known as Ho Wang (, lit. palace dormitory). The name was adopted by the university's teacher-training school, which was established nearby and became known as Horwang Secondary School of Chulalongkorn University. Use of the palace ceased in 1935 when the area was requested for construction of the National Stadium. The faculty was relocated, and Horwang School moved to the site that is now Triam Udom Suksa School. Demolition and excavation Marble fragments from the palace displayed at the Chulalongkorn University School of Sports Science Following the Siamese Revolution of 1932 which abolished absolute monarchy, the property surrounding Windsor Palace was leased to the Ministry of Education's Department of Physical Education in 1935 to serve as the construction site for the National Stadium complex, with Suphachalasai Stadium at its core. The palace was subsequently demolished, and its existence faded from public knowledge. Part of the National Stadium complex was established as the Central Physical Education School, which later became part of Srinakharinwirot Universitys Faculty of Physical Education. Ownership of these buildings was transferred to Chulalongkorn University's School of Sports Science when their lease expired in 1997. Later during renovations by Chulalongkorn University, fragments of marble columns and statues were discovered, and it was concluded that they originated from the palace structure. These are now on display at the School of Sports Science. Numerous marble fragments have also been found within the site of the National Stadium, but have been left lying around as debris. There have been calls for formal excavation and cataloguing, but no substantial developments have yet emerged. On the eightieth anniversary of the establishment of Chulalongkorn University in 1997, a set of commemorative postage stamps was issued. Windsor Palace was featured in one of the designs.

The battle of Samugarh was fought between his sons Dara Shikoh (the eldest son and heir apparent) and his two younger brothers Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh (third and fourth sons of Shah Jahan). Dara Shikoh began to retreat towards Samugarh, about 10 miles (16 km) east of Agra, India, south of the Yamuna River, after Aurangzeb had defeated Dara Shikoh's forces during the Battle of Dharmat. Aurangzeb and his smaller but formidable army then flanked Dara‚Äôs fortified line along the Chambal River by finding a little-known and unguarded ford. The battle was fought during northern India's warmest season and Aurangzeb's men were on the march for a very long while. The army of Aurangzeb arrived with yellow banners and flags and fortified their position in front of the heir apparent. Dara Shikoh then tried to protect his rear flank by erecting massive red tents and banners. Preparations Dara Shikoh Dara Shikoh ordered his large cannons from Jaigarh Fort to be chained together (limiting their mobility), Zamburak's armed with swivel guns were positioned behind the cannons and infantry Sepoys armed with muskets defended both the cannons and the Zamburak (Aurangzeb also adopted this maneuver). However the experienced and accomplished Mughal general Mir Jumla II, positioned hidden cannons in strategic locations across the battlefield assuring Aurangzeb of successful grapeshot's and sudden assaults. Both Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh were seated on massive Elephant Howdahs and armed with Matchlocks. Aurangzeb's far left flank was commanded by Murad Baksh and his elite Mughal Sowars, the rest of the army was effectively under the command of Aurangzeb and his assisting imperial general Mir Jumla II, Murshid Quli Khan was assigned as the Mir Atish (artillery chief). Dara Shikoh on the other hand, divided his massive army, his far right was commanded by the Rao Raja Chattar Sal of Bundi, his main right was commanded by Rustam Khan Deccani who was well appointed by Shah Jahan, his elite Mughal Sowars were commanded by Khalilullah Khan an Uzbek commander, furthermore Dara Shikoh awaited the arrival of his son Sulaiman Shikoh commanding 40,000. Battle thumb Aurangzeb with soldiers 270x270px The battle began when Dara Shikoh ordered his cannons to start firing towards the army of Aurangzeb. Eventually both sides began to launch volley's against each other. Their artillery shelling had to be postponed due to brief raining. When the rains subsided both sides resumed firing. Angered by the cannon fire Murad Baksh and his Sowars began a swift charge into the far right flank of Dara Shikoh commanded by Chattar Sal without the orders of Aurangzeb. It is believed that Murad Baksh was a sworn enemy of Chattar Sal, they had both fought ferociously on the battlefield as the Sowars of Murad Baksh and the Rajput warriors of Chattar Sal decimated each other, Khalilullah Khan refused to aid the Rajputs and instead guided his forces to protect Dara Shikoh. Fearing the impending collapse of the Chattar Sal and the Rajput far right Rustam Khan Deccani, led a massive Sowar charge towards the cannon front of Aurangzeb in his attempt to flank and attack Murad Baksh from behind, but his efforts were met by ferocious cannon fire by Aurangzeb that eventually caused the death of Rustam Khan Deccani and many of Dara Shikoh's most important Sowars. Meanwhile, it is believed that Murad Baksh killed the Rajput second in command Ram Singh Rautela (Raja Rautela) by shooting an arrow from his composite bow, the arrow is known to have pierced the turban of Ram Singh Rautela and eventually rendered the Rajputs leaderless on the battlefield. When Dara Shikoh was informed about the death of Chattar Sal and that Murad Baksh had shot with an arrow Rustam Khan Deccani from his composite bow, and the collapse of the Rajput infantry and the Deccan Sowars he immediately pushed towards their aid alongside Khalilullah Khan in an attempt to rout the wounded but very formidable Murad Baksh. But Dara Shikoh faced heavy bombardment by the cannon front of Aurangzeb, the bombardment even made its way into the cannon front of Dara Shikoh causing massive disarray among his ranks. Due to Aurangzeb's heavy bombardment Dara Shikoh decided to join Khalilullah Khan in the Cavalry. The outcome of the battle was decided when Dara Shikoh descended from his Elephant Howdah at the most critical moment of the battle, his elephant then quickly fled from the battlefield. Fleeing elephant was evidence enough for Dara Shikoh's troops who mistook this event to indicate his death. Thousands of Dara Shikoh's forces surrendered to Aurangzeb when the Mughal military band of Aurangzeb played the ode of victory. Many more Sepoys and Sowars fled only to take the oath of allegiance to Aurangzeb later on. Conclusion Sepoy's loyal to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, maintain their positions around Agra, in the year 1658. Although Dara Shikoh was the most powerful man in the Mughal Empire after his father Shah Jahan, he knew little about the art of war and military command. His loosely knit army eventually crumbled and even refused to aid each other. The ferocious assault by Murad Baksh was very successful, although he was eventually wounded and his horse was killed. Despite being surrounded by the Rajputs and the Deccan Sowars, Murad Baksh managed to protect himself and his Sowars until the end of the battle. He is also known to have killed Raja Rautela through his archery skills. When the battle ended Dara Shikoh and Khalilullah Khan fled towards Sulaiman Shikoh and Aurangzeb was declared the new Mughal Emperor. Aurangzeb then marched onwards to Agra which he besieged, however not until he closed down the city's water supply did his father Shah Jahan finally surrender. Shah Jahan was soon imprisoned in the Agra Fort. Later Khalilullah Khan swore an oath of allegiance to Aurangzeb as a Mansabdar. Eventually both Dara Shikoh and Sulaiman Shikoh were captured by the Afghan Malik Jiwan Khan, and handed over to Aurangzeb. Dara Shikioh was paraded through the streets of Agra and later declared a \\"Non-Muslim\\" during a smear campaign by Aurangzeb. He was later executed along with his son Sulaiman Shikoh. However Aurangzeb's woes had not ended until the year 1659, when another ferocious battle was fought between Aurangzeb and his elder brother Shuja during the Battle of Khajwa.

Don Polye temporarily took over his portfolio.\\"PNG minister quits over election charges\\", AAP, 19 March 2013 The corruption charges were dismissed by the district court in June, finding that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case, and Arore resumed his ministerial roles. Arore was dropped from the ministry in a February 2014 reshuffle, replaced by his party colleague Delilah Gore. He resigned from the Triumph Heritage Empowerment Rural Party, along with three other MPs, in May 2014, following leader Polye's move to the opposition, having decided to continue to support the government. On 25 June, Arore and the other MPs joined Prime Minister O'Neill's People's National Congress. In October 2014, a long-running feud with Northern Province governor Gary Juffa came to a head when he attempted to install himself as Governor, resulting in the arrest of several of his supporters, with Juffa ultimately remaining in office. Unseating and re- election In May 2015, the National Court (sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns) unseated Arore, finding that he was guilty of bribery during the 2012 election campaign and that his election was consequently null and void. The court ordered a by-election in his seat. The People's National Congress re- endorsed him for the by-election, resulting in criticism from the Papua New Guinea chapter of Transparency International and in the Papua New Guinea Post- Courier. He won the by-election in December 2015 and returned to parliament. At the 2017 election, Arore contested the Northern Province governorship against incumbent Gary Juffa, rather than recontest Ijivitari Open. He finished fourth, polling only 6,129 votes to Juffa's 37,729.

History  In 1190, Philip II of France gave the abbaye de Saint- Victor de Paris lands at Grosbois in exchange for lands in the bois de Vincennes. The abbey ceded these lands in 1563 to Raoul Moreau, treasurer of Spain, whose relation Nicolas Harlay de Sancy, surintendant des Finances et des B√¢timents du roi, built a ch√¢teau there at the start of the 17th century. This was still incomplete in 1616, when it was sold to Charles de Valois (1573‚Äì1650), count of Auvergne then duke of Angoul√™me (1619), illegitimate son of Charles IX of France by Marie Touchet. de Valois completed the ch√¢teau around 1640, notably building the enclosing wall (1623) and the two wings. On his death in 1650 the estate passed to his granddaughter, wife of Louis, Duke of Joyeuse. In 1718, the estate was bought by Samuel-Jacques Bernard (1686-1753), son of the financier Samuel Bernard, who commissioned the woodwork in the salon R√©gence. He then sold it to Germain Louis Chauvelin in 1731, who in 1762 sold it in turn to Fran√ßois Marie Peyrenc de Moras. She left it to her great-niece Anne Marie de Merle de Beauchamps in 1771 - Anne Marie was daughter of an ambassador to the king of Portugal and wife of Pierre Paul Gilbert des Voisins, pr√©sident to the parlement de Paris. She and her husband sold it to the comte de Provence in 1776. It was confiscated as national property on the French Revolution and sold on 9 November 1797 to Barras, known as 'the king of the Directory'. After 18 brumaire, Barras was exiled to Belgium and sold the ch√¢teau, in 1801, to g√©n√©ral Moreau. In 1804, after Moreau's arrest, Napoleon I bought the ch√¢teau via Fouch√© and in 1805 granted it to mar√©chal Berthier, prince of Wagram. Berthier spent much money embellishing it, expanding the library, the galerie des Batailles, the salon de l'Empereur and the salon des Huissiers. He also built two more pavilions and the entrance gate across the road. He enlarged the estate to make it the best hunting-ground in the French Empire and gave grand festivals there. His son Napol√©on Berthier expanded the library, which included over 3,000 works. On August 1, 1914, Alexander Louis Philippe Marie Berthier, the 4th Prince of Wagram, left Grosbois to his sister, Elisabeth Berthier de Wagram, Princesse de la Tour d‚ÄôAuvergne, before leaving for the army. He died April 30, 1918 from battle wounds. He was unmarried and was the last Prince of Wagram. During the war, Grosbois Castle served as a hospital for the Red Cross with 30 beds. Army troops were also quartered by the hundreds in the castle.https://montjoye.net/chateau-de-grosbois Elisabeth Berthier de Wagram was the last owner of the line of Berthier. She died in 1960. Due to taxes, upkeep and other financial reasons, the property was sold in 1962 to Ren√© Balli√®re, president of the Soci√©t√© d‚Äôencouragement √† l‚Äô√©levage du cheval fran√ßais, who bought the estate to set up a training centre for racehorses.  Architecture  Designed by an unknown architect, the ch√¢teau de Grosbois is clearly influenced by those designed by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau. On a U plan, it is made up of a central wing curved into an exedra, flanked by two pavilions of the same height and by two lower wings at right angles.

The name stands for Health and Care. It is Britain's largest care home operator. HC-One operates 329 care homes throughout the UK specialising in dementia, nursing, residential and specialist care for elderly people. History HC-One was formed in 2011 following the collapse of the UK's then-largest nursing home operator, Southern Cross Healthcare. The homes managed by Southern Cross were mostly owned by other companies, and when it became insolvent these landlord companies then needed to set up or contract with alternative operators to run the homes. The largest of these landlords was NHP (Nursing Home Properties), with 249 homes previously run by Southern Cross. Entrepreneur Chai Patel, a doctor and former Chief Executive of Priory Group, formed a consultancy in the name of his old company Court Cavendish, and joined with NHP to form HC-One to manage these homes.Dr Chai Patel moves from Kate Moss to Southern Cross care homes, The Daily Telegraph, 30 July 2011 Patel became the Chairman of HC-One. Patel also offered the company's services to run the 90 homes owned by London & Regional Properties, but that landlord chose to split its nursing home portfolio between two other operators. HC-One became operational on 1 November 2011, running 241 care homes and employing over 14,000 staff. In June 2017, HC-One appointed Justin Hutchens into the role of Chief Executive Officer. Later that year Professor Graham Stokes was appointed to lead the company's dementia care strategy. The company was put up for sale in May 2018 for ¬£1 billion. Its immediate owner is Libra Intermediate, based in Jersey and the ultimate owner is FC Skyfall LP, based in the Cayman Islands. It has a complex corporate structure, with 50 companies, six of which are registered offshore either in the Cayman Islands or Jersey and a further five in the UK as foreign entities. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were about ¬£130 million in 2017. The company paid out dividends of ¬£42.3 million in 2017 and ¬£6.2 million in 2018. In November 2018, HC-One was awarded Care Home Group of the Year at the National Care Awards in London. The same year HC-One was also recognised by www.carehome.co.uk, the trip advisor style site to the care sector, achieving a 9.5 average review score rating from relatives and Residents living in their homes. The group's focus and commitment in driving standards has been further acknowledged by Skills for Care who have accredited the organisation as a Centre for Excellence in 2017 and 2018. HC-One homes in the north west of England were awarded Investor in People Gold Accreditation in 2019; an accolade unusual to care home groups and demonstrating the organisations' ongoing commitment to its people. After three years as CEO, in February 2020 Justin Hutchens left HC-One to take up a new role in America. HC-One announced that he would be replaced by Sir David Behan CBE, who was appointed Executive Chairman, having previously served as Chairman. HC-One Board member John Ransford CBE was appointed Interim Chief Operating Officer, and existing Chief Financial Officer, David Smith, assumed a number of new operational responsibilities to sit alongside his existing remit. In July 2020, HC-One announced that James Tugendhat had been appointed Chief Executive Officer and would join the company in September that year. It was also announced that Sir David Behan CBE, who had been Executive Chairman of the company since February 2020, would revert to his previous role as Chairman of the HC-One Board. Acquisitions In 2015, HC-One acquired 30 care homes from Meridian Healthcare in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Yorkshire, North Lincolnshire, Cheshire and Derbyshire. In 2017, HC-One purchased 20 care homes from Helen McArdle Care, making them the largest care home provider in the North East of England. In August 2017 it bought 122 care homes, with 9,000 beds, from Bupa for ¬£300 million, making it the biggest care home company in the UK with 22,000 beds in total and 22,000 staff. Incidents One of HC- One's homes, Oban House, was featured in an episode of the BBC's Panorama programme, investigating poor care there and at another home owned by another company. In response, HC-One expressed a desire to install surveillance cameras in its homes to prevent a recurrence.BBC Panorama exposes abuse and neglect at two care homes, Care Home, 29 May 2014 A multi-agency review into HC One's Blar Buidhe Care Home in the Outer Hebrides is under way following a number of concerns raised over the dietary programmes of residents. In 2016 the Four Seasons Care Home in Breightmet, labelled inadequate by the Care Quality Commission in May 2015 was banned from taking new residents while concerns about the administration of medicines and the leadership and management of the home were investigated. The company said they were forced to rely on temporary agency nurses. In the wake of an outbreak of COVID-19 infections at a care home run by HC-One in the Isle of Skye, the Scottish Care Inspectorate took legal action to take over running the Home Farm care home. It also moved to cancel the company's registration of the care home.

The Conservative Party, which forms the mainstream centre-right party in Britain, has developed many different internal factions and ideologies. History =Edmund Burke= Edmund Burke Edmund Burke is often considered the father of modern English conservatism in the English-speaking world. Burke was a member of a conservative faction of the Whig party;However, Burke lived before the terms \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" were used to describe political ideologies, and he dubbed his faction the \\"Old Whigs\\". cf. J. C. D. Clark, English Society, 1660‚Äì1832 (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 5, p. 301. the modern Conservative Party however has been described by Lord Norton of Louth as \\"the heir, and in some measure the continuation, of the old Tory Party\\", and the Conservatives are often still referred to as Tories. The Australian scholar Glen Worthington has said: \\"For Edmund Burke and Australians of a like mind, the essence of conservatism lies not in a body of theory, but in the disposition to maintain those institutions seen as central to the beliefs and practices of society.\\"Worthington, Glen, Conservatism in Australian National Politics, Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library, 19 February 2002 =Tories= The old established form of English and, after the Act of Union, British conservatism, was the Tory Party. It reflected the attitudes of a rural land owning class, and championed the institutions of the monarchy, the Anglican Church, the family, property as the best defence of the social order. In the early stages of the industrial revolution, it seemed to be totally opposed to a process that seemed to undermine some of these bulwarks, and the new industrial elite were seen by many as enemies to the social order. It split in 1846 following the repeal of the Corn Laws (the tariff on imported corn). Proponents of free trade in the late 19th century and early 20th century failed to make much headway as \\"tariff reform\\" resulted in new tariffs. The coalition of traditional landowners and sympathetic industrialists constituted the new Conservative Party.Anna Gambles, \\"Rethinking the politics of protection: Conservatism and the corn laws, 1830-52.\\" English Historical Review 113.453 (1998): 928-952 online. =One-nation conservatism= Benjamin Disraeli was the father of one-nation conservatism. Conservatism evolved after 1820, embracing imperialism and realization that an expanded working class electorate could neutralize the Liberal advantage among the middle classes. Disraeli defined the Conservative approach and strengthened Conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defence of the landed aristocracy but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy, and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and Liberals.Gregory Claeys, \\"Political Thought,\\" in Chris Williams, ed., A Companion to 19th- Century Britain (2006). p 195 As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only \\"really democratic party of England\\" and devoted to the interests of the whole people. Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side, and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.Auerbach, The Conservative Illusion. (1959), pp. 39‚Äì40 The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate. Disraeli set up a Conservative Central Office, established in 1870, and the newly formed National Union (which drew together local voluntary associations), gave the party \\"additional unity and strength\\", and Disraeli's views on social reform and the wealth disparity between the richest and poorest in society allegedly \\"helped the party to break down class barriers\\", according to Conservative peer Lord Norton. As a young man, Disraeli was influenced by the romantic movement and medievalism, and developed a critique of industrialism. In his novels, he outlined an England divided into two nations, each living in perfect ignorance of each other. He foresaw, like Karl Marx, the phenomenon of an alienated industrial proletariat. His solution involved a return to an idealised view of a corporate or organic society, in which everyone had duties and responsibilities towards other people or groups. This \\"one nation\\" conservatism is still a significant tradition in British politics, in both the Conservative PartyStephen Evans, \\"The Not So Odd Couple: Margaret Thatcher and One Nation Conservatism.\\" Contemporary British History 23.1 (2009): 101-121. and Labour,See: One Nation Labour. especially with the rise of the Scottish National Party during the 2015 general election. Although nominally a Conservative, Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the demands of the Chartists and argued for an alliance between the landed aristocracy and the working-class against the increasing power of the middle class, helping to found the Young England group in 1842 to promote the view that the rich should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by the middle-class. The conversion of the Conservative Party into a modern mass organisation was accelerated by the concept of Tory Democracy attributed to Lord Randolph Churchill, father of Winston Churchill. = Early 20th century= Winston Churchill, although best known as the most prominent conservative since Disraeli ‚Äì crossed the aisle in 1904 and became a Liberal for two decades. As one of the most active and aggressive orators of his day, he thrilled the left in 1909 by ridiculing the Conservatives as, \\"the party of the rich against the poor, of the classes ...against the masses, of the lucky, the wealthy, the happy, and the strong against the left-out and the shut-out millions of the weak and poor.\\" His harsh words were hurled back at him when he rejoined the conservative party in 1924. The shock of a landslide defeat in 1906 forced the Conservatives to rethink operations, and they worked to build grassroots groups that would help turn out their vote.David Thackeray, David. \\"Rethinking the Edwardian crisis of conservatism.\\" Historical Journal (2011): 191-213 online. The Conservative Party responded by creating the Workers Defence Union (WDU) designed to frighten the working-class into voting Conservative. It first promoted tariff reform (that is high tariffs to protect factory jobs). Increasingly the WDU focused on attacking immigrant workers as a threat to jobs that belonged to true Britons. It had considerable success by arousing hatred of \\"alien subversion.\\" It became a far deeper matter than job loss--the aliens threatened the purity of \\"English race and the appeal created fears and racism in the middle and upper class as well.Alan Sykes, \\"Radical conservatism and the working classes in Edwardian England: the case of the Workers Defence Union.\\" English Historical Review (1998): 1180-1209 online. Women played a new role in the early 20th century, signalled in 1906 by setting up the Women's Unionist and Tariff Reform Association (WUTRA). When the Liberals failed to support woman suffrage, the Conservatives acted, especially by passing the Representation of the People Act 1918 and the Equal Franchise Act of 1928.David Jarvis, \\"Mrs Maggs and Betty: The Conservative Appeal to Women Voters in the 1920s.\\" Twentieth Century British History 5.2 (1994): 129-152. They realized that women housewives were often conservative in outlook, adverse to the aggressive tone of socialist rhetoric, and supported imperialism and traditional values.Clarisse Berthez√®ne, and Julie Gottlieb, eds., Rethinking Right-Wing Women: Gender And The Conservative Party, 1880s To The Present (Manchester UP, 2018). Conservatives claimed that they represented orderly politics, peace, and the interests of the ex-serviceman's family.David Thackeray, \\"Building a peaceable party: masculine identities in British Conservative politics, c. 1903‚Äì24.\\" Historical Research 85.230 (2012): 651-673. The 1928 Act added five million more women to the electoral roll and had the effect of making women a majority, 52.7%, of the electorate in the 1929 general election, which was termed the \\"Flapper Election\\". A Neo-Tory movement flourished in the 1930s as part of a pan-European reaction against modernity. A network of right-wing intellectuals and allied politicians ridiculed democracy, liberalism and modern capitalism as degenerate. They warned against the emergence of a corporate state in Britain imposed from above¬ª. The intellectuals involved followed trends in Italy. France and especially Germany. The exchange of ideas with the continent was at first a source of inspiration, reassurance and hope. After Hitler's rise in 1933 it meant their downfall. War with Germany in 1939 ended British participation in transnational radical conservatism.Bernhard Dietz, \\"The Neo-Tories and Europe: A Transnational History of British Radical Conservatism in the 1930s.\\" Journal of Modern European History 15.1 (2017): 85-108. =Post-war consensus= During and after World War II, the Conservative Party made concessions to the socialist policies of the left. This compromise was a pragmatic measure to regain power, but also the result of the early successes of central planning and state ownership forming a cross-party consensus. The conservatism version was known as Butskellism, after the almost identical Keynesian policies of Rab Butler on behalf of the Conservatives, and Hugh Gaitskell for Labour. The \\"post-war consensus\\" emerged as an all-party national government under Churchi;ll promised Britons a better life after the war. Conservatives especially promoted educational reforms to reach a much larger population. The foundations of the post-war consensus was the Beveridge Report. This was a report by William Beveridge, a Liberal economist who in 1942 formulated the concept of a more comprehensive welfare state in Great Britain.Kenneth O. Morgan, Britain Since 1945: The People's Peace (2001), pp. 4, 6 The report sought widespread reform by identifying the \\"five giants on the road of reconstruction\\": \\"Want‚Ä¶ Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness\\". In the report were labelled a number of recommendations: the appointment of a minister to control all the insurance schemes; a standard weekly payment by people in work as a contribution to the insurance fund; old age pensions, maternity grants, funeral grants, pensions for widows and for people injured at work; a new national health service to be established. In the period between 1945-1970 (consensus years) that unemployment averaged less than 3%. The post-war consensus included a belief in Keynesian economics, a mixed economy with the nationalisation of major industries, the establishment of the National Health Service and the creation of the modern welfare state in Britain. The policies were instituted by all governments (both Labour and Conservative) in the post-war period. The consensus has been held to characterise British politics until the economic crises of the 1970s (see Secondary banking crisis of 1973‚Äì1975) which led to the end of the post-war economic boom and the rise of monetarist economics. The roots of his economics, however, stem from critique of the economics of the interwar period depression. Keynes' style of economics encouraged a more active role of the government in order to \\"manage overall demand so that there was a balance between demand and output\\".Kavanagh, Dennis, Peter Morris, and Dennis Kavanagh. Consensus Politics from Attlee to Major. (Blackwell, 1994) P. 37. The post-war consensus in favour of the welfare state forced conservative historians, typified by Herbert Butterfield to re-examine British history. They were no longer optimistic about human nature, nor the possibility of progress, yet neither were they open to liberalism's emphasis on individualism. As a Christian, Butterfield could argue that God had decided the course of history but had not necessarily needed to reveal its meaning to historians. Reba N. Soffer, \\"The Conservative historical imagination in the twentieth century.\\" Albion 28.1 (1996): 1-17. Thanks to Iain Macleod,Edward Heath and Enoch Powell, special attention was paid to \\"One-nation conservatism\\" (coined by Disraeli) that promised support for the poorer and working class elements in the Party coalition. Robert Walsha, \\"The one nation group and one nation Conservatism, 1950‚Äì2002.\\" Contemporary British History 17.2 (2003): 69-120. =Rise of Thatcherism= Margaret Thatcher However, in the 1980s, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, and the influence of Keith Joseph, there was a dramatic shift in the ideological direction of British conservatism, with a movement towards free-market economic policies and neoliberalism (commonly referred to as Thatcherism).Scott-Samuel, Alex, et al. \\"The Impact of Thatcherism on Health and Well-Being in Britain.\\" International Journal of Health Services 44.1 (2014): 53-71. As one commentator explains, \\"The privatisation of state owned industries, unthinkable before, became commonplace [during Thatcher's government] and has now been imitated all over the world.\\"Davies, Stephen, Margaret Thatcher and the Rebirth of Conservatism, Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs, July 1993 Thatcher was described as \\"a radical in a conservative party\\", and her ideology has been seen as confronting \\"established institutions\\" and the \\"accepted beliefs of the elite\\", both concepts incompatible with the traditional conception of conservatism as signifying support for the established order and existing social convention (status quo).Wiktionary:conservatism =Modern conservatism= Following a third consecutive general election defeat in 2005, the Conservative Party selected David Cameron as party leader, followed by Theresa May in 2016, both of whom have served as Prime Minister and sought to modernise and change the ideological position of British conservatism. In efforts to rebrand and increase the party's appeal, both leaders have adopted policies which align with liberal conservatism. This has included a \\"greener\\" environmental and energy stance, and adoption of some socially liberal views, such as acceptance of same-sex marriage. However, these policies have been accompanied by a fiscal conservatism, in which they have maintained a hard stance on bringing down the deficit, and embarked upon a programme of economic austerity. Other modern policies which align with one-nation conservatism and Christian democracy include education reform, extending student loan applicants to postgraduate applicants, and allowing those from poorer backgrounds to go further, whilst still increasing tuition fees and introducing a higher cap. There has also been an emphasis on human rights, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights, whilst also supporting individual initiative. However, with the global rise of populism, the Conservative party has become more populist with many viewing it as undoing the previous modernising workFrances Perraudin, ''Tories turning into Blukip': MPs lay out reasons for leaving Conservatives ‚Äì as it happened' (20/02/19) on The Guardian In the 2010s during the Brexit negotiations, the Conservative Party appeared very divided over Brexit.

Opened in 1897, the station is owned and operated by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). It forms the junction between the Z√ºrich‚ÄìLucerne railway and the Thalwil‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway, which connects with the Gotthard railway. Every day, some 66,000 people pass through the station. Location Zug railway station is situated in Bahnhofplatz, right in the heart of the city centre, a short distance from the shore of Lake Zug. History The first railway station in Zug was built in 1863-1864 by the architect Friedrich Jacob Wanner, in what is now the Bundesplatz. It was a terminal station, which could be reached only from the direction of Cham and Knonau. With an additional junction, trains could be turned. In 1897, as the railway lines to Z√ºrich via Thalwil and to Arth-Goldau were opened, the station had to be moved to its current site. The original station building was dismantled and rebuilt in Z√ºrich Wollishofen. Station building Between 2001 and 2004, a redesigned station building was constructed at the station, at a cost of some 65 million Swiss francs. The building area is approximately 6500 m¬≤. The redesigned building consists of a basement used for storage, one retail space at street level and another at platform level, and three floors of office space above. A total of 14 retail stores are located in the retail spaces. A new passage to the station entrance was specially built, so that pedestrians can reach the concourse more easily. Additionally, the separate Grafenau and Metalli quarters are now easier to reach. For the cyclists, new shelters were built. The newly created Bahnhofsplatz serves as a bus turning area. There are also internet connections, via wireless LAN, at certain locations within the station. From the onset of dusk until 23:00 hours, the station building is illuminated by a light installation by artist James Turrell. For that purpose, the southern glass facade is equipped with fluorescent tubes, which are mounted so that the colors red, green and blue and resulting mixed colors can be created. As the control system of the light elements can suffer technical problems during long-lasting cold weather, the installation is shut down in such weather. On 19 October 2005, the station received a Brunel Award for its architecture and light installation.  Station yard  The station yard consists of seven tracks, of which one is a terminating track, while the other six tracks are through tracks. Altogether, there are a side platform (track 7) and three island platforms, one of which is laid out in a wedge shape (tracks 3/4). One of the remaining island platforms is a partial side platform, due to the head track status of track 1. Passenger movements are usually handled as follows: * Track 1: Terminal track, serves the S24 to Z√ºrich HB - Winterthur (- Schaffhausen - Thayngen) * Track 2: IC/EC/IR to Arth-Goldau-Ticino * Track 3: IC/EC/IR to Z√ºrich HB, S2 to Baar Lindenpark and Erstfeld * Track 4: IR to Luzern, S1 to Rotkreuz and Luzern * Track 5: IR to Z√ºrich HB/Z√ºrich Flughafen, S1 to Baar * Track 6: A sidetrack, mostly used if another track is occupied * Track 7: S5 to Affoltern-Z√ºrich- Uster-Pf√§ffikon SZ  Services  The following services call at Zug: * EuroCity: service every two hours between Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof and ; one train per day continues to . * InterCity: service every two hours between Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof and . * InterRegio: ** service every hour between Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof and . ** service every hour between and Lucerne. ** service every two hours between Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof and . * Lucerne S-Bahn /Zug Stadtbahn : service every fifteen minutes between Rotkreuz and , with every other train continuing from Rotkreuz to . * Z√ºrich S-Bahn: ** : half-hourly service to . ** : half-hourly service to , trains continue from Winterthur to either or .

More precisely they lived near modern Xanten, and the old Castra Vetera, on the Rhine. This part of Germania Secunda was called the Civitas or Colonia Traiana (polity or colony of Trajan), and it was also inhabited by the Betasii.  Name  The variants Cugerni, used by Tacitus and in the epigraphic record, and Cuberni, attested by Pliny and a single inscription, presumably originated from older variations in spelling. The name of the Cugerni is not recorded as one which ever existed on the east of the Rhine, unlike the Ubii, but the Cugerni are thought to descend at least partly from a part of the Sicambri, who had already been present just over the Rhine in the time of Caesar, and then moved over the Rhine. However as with the Batavi and Tungri and other tribes of the region during Roman times, the ancestry of the Cugerni was probably mixed, and may have included other tribes from the east of the Rhine, plus survivors of the Menapii or Eburones who lived in this region in the time of Caesar, when it was considered to be part of Gaul, and not yet part of the Roman Empire.  Geography  The Cugerni are amongst the Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine from east to west, and were settled in the Roman Empire. Similarly, to their south were the Ubii who also lived on the Rhine, around the modern city of Cologne in their Colonia Agrippenses. To the west of the Cugerni and Betasii were the Batavi, and to their southwest were the Tungri, along with other tribes such as the Toxandri, living in the Civitas Tungrorum. Apart from the area of Xanten, places which were apparently in their region were Gelduba (Gellep near Krefeld), Asciburgium (Asberg, also near Krefeld), Burginatium (near Kalkar), and Quadriburgium (Qualberg near Kleve). However nearby Neuss was in the region of the Ubii, with its capital at Cologne.  History  The region of the Cugerni was in the centre of action during the Batavian revolt, with different tribal groups taking different sides. The Cugerni took the side of Gaius Julius Civilis. The population of Germania Inferior reduced significantly in late Roman times, as new waves of Germanic tribes raided, and the Roman empire lost military control. Tribes such as the Chamavi, Chattuarii, and Sallii were eventually allowed to settle semi-independently within Germania Inferior, and were referred to as Franks. They united under kings and then proceeded to conquer a large part of Western Europe. Therefore any surviving Cugerni who stayed in the area were later absorbed into the Frankish kingdom.

History Ryhope Grammar School was built by Durham County Council in 1910 and opened on 16 September 1911. It was named Robert Richardson Grammar School in honour of local councillor Robert Richardson, who fought a campaign to have a grammar school built in Ryhope. Former Ryhope Public Elementary School pupil Ralph Williams was appointed as headmaster, welcoming a first intake of 74 boys and 81 girls. Built on a four-acre site on the outskirts of Ryhope, the new school offered \\"every convenience, an excellent playing field and electricity throughout.\\" A charge of ¬£1 10 shillings per term was made to each pupil to cover tuition costs, use of apparatus, books and paper. Ryhope Grammar School proved an immediate success. Within a year it was over-subscribed. \\"The school is well-disciplined and efficiently organised. Pupils are of good behaviour and staff are well chosen and highly capable,\\" a report by education inspectors stated. Several Old Ryhopeans fought in the First World War. Among these was Norman Pigg, the school's first sports champion, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the Military Cross with two bars and three mentions in Dispatches. Fourteen Old Boys died in battle. Pigg lead a fund- raising campaign to commemorate the fallen after the war, with an organ and plaque being erected in the school hall in 1924. Ryhope Grammar School became one of the first schools in the country to offer Advanced Courses ‚Äì the fore- runner of A Levels - in 1918, allowing pupils to study until the age of 18 and move on to university degrees. In the early 1930s, when Seaham Harbour Grammar School for Girls opened, Ryhope ceased to be co-educational. The school closed for several weeks following the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, re- opening on a part-time basis with 21-minute lessons. It became one of the first schools in the country to form an Air Training Corps unit, and hundreds of Old Ryhopeans fought in the conflict. A total of 34 died in the six years of war. New examinations - O Levels and A Levels - were introduced after the war and pupil numbers increased from 432 in 1947 to 586 by 1959. In 1962 the school once again opened its doors to girls and, in 1969, it amalgamated with Ryhope Modern to become a comprehensive school. The school made headlines in the 1970s, featuring on national television, with productions of the rock operas Tommy and Stardust. Ryhope Grammar School, by now known as Ryhope School, closed in July 1988. Today modern apartments and houses stand on the site, and only the old sports field remains.

The historiography of the Gaspee affair examines the changing views of scholars with regard to the Gaspee affair of 1772. Contemporary reports There were 38 newspapers in mainland British America in 1772. At least 11, mostly in the Northeast, reported the attack on the Gaspee within the first few weeks following the incident.David A. Copeland, Colonial American Newspapers (Newark, University of Delaware Press, 1997), 279. The South Carolina Gazette reported it within three weeks. Merrill Jensen, The Founding of a Nation: A History of the American Revolution, 1763‚Äì1776 (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 1968, 2004), 428. Moreover, the Gaspee Commission of Inquiry was the topic of one of the most important pre-independence pamphlets to circulate within the colonies, John Allen‚Äôs An Oration, Upon the Beauties of Liberty, Or the Essential Rights of Americans. Allen, a little-known preacher at the Second Baptist Church in Boston, gave an emotional sermon in December 1772 that played upon colonial fears and prejudices. Though Allen was not a particularly notable thinker or writer, and his arguments were not always accurate or consistent, his Oration went through seven printings (five editions) published in four different cities.Eds. G. Jack Gravlee and James R. Irvine, Pamphlets and the American Revolution: Rhetoric, Politics, Literature, and the Popular Press Scholar‚Äôs Facsimiles & Reprints (Delmar, NY, 1976), viii. Allen argued that Great Britain and the American colonies were separate judicial spheres and one could not interfere with the other. He addressed his message to Lord Dartmouth and portrayed the actions of colonials as merely self-defense, not rebellion, an important distinction for his reading audience in early 1773. When Oration was published it ranked among the best-selling pamphlets of the crisis.John M. Bumsted and Charles E. Clark, \\"New England‚Äôs Tom Paine: John Allen and the Spirit of Liberty,\\" William and Mary Quarterly Third Series, Vol. 21, Issue 4 (October 1964): 561, 566. Bernard Bailyn included Allen among only three colonial pamphleteers were who able to demonstrate the \\"concentrated fury\\" comparable to that found in tracts and treaties by Europe's more imaginative and capable writers.Bernard Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (Cambridge, MA, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1967), 18. While Allen's Oration was among the more incendiary, there is no evidence that it was every serialized or extracted in newspapers. Perhaps that was partly because of his death in 1774.The time of his death remains uncertain, see Steven H. Park, The Burning of H.M.S. Gaspee and the Limited of Eighteenth-Century British Imperial Power, 2005, Unpublished Dissertation, Chapter 4. Moreover, subsequent events like the Boston Tea Party quickly overshadowed the Gaspee incident. The reactions (and overreaction) of Parliament in 1774 preoccupied Patriot presses and later historical narratives. Forever afterwards, the Gaspee episode has remained of minor concern to those who recounted the events leading up to April 1775. When, in 1796, Richard Snowden published his history of the American Revolution in Baltimore, he started with the Boston Tea Party and made no mention of the Gaspee or, for that matter, any event prior to 1773.

Even a book focused on the Royal Navy's difficulties in the colonies from 1763 to 1782 failed to mention the Gaspee.Captain W.M. James, The British Navy in Adversity: A Study of the War of American Independence (London: Longmans, Green and Co. LTD., 1926) p. 25 skips from 1770 to 1773. To this day, no scholar has dedicated a monograph to the Gaspee episode, such as Benjamin Woods Labaree‚Äôs The Boston Tea Party or Hiller B. Zobel‚Äôs The Boston Massacre.Lawrence J. DeVaro and Steven H. Park have written the only dissertations that represent a nonfiction book-length work aimed at an adult readership. Early 19th century After 1800 chroniclers and biographers started to write histories about the events and well-known personalities of the American Revolution. Many romanticized it as a \\"Golden Age\\" and de- emphasized its revolutionary character, especially in light of disturbing revolutionary events in France, Haiti, and Latin America. Others sought to interview aging survivors of the Revolution, even tracking down those who had fled to Canada or London. Three colonial participants from the attack on the Gaspee documented their memories of that night: Dr. John Mawney, the doctor who tended to the Lieutenant's wounds; Ephraim Bowen, who provided Joseph Bucklin with the firearm used to shoot the British ldieutenant; and Aaron Biggs, an indentured servant who gave contemporary testimony that he was an eyewitness to the events of 9‚Äì10 June 1772. The colonial government and Patriot press worked hard to discredit his deposition. Biggs was retained on a British vessel for his own safety. Bowen was only 19 in 1772, but later achieved the rank of Colonel and went on to run a successful rum distillery in Pawtuxet Village. In 1839, at 86, two years before his death, Bowen attempted to recall the events of that night 67 years earlier. Confident that everyone else who was involved was dead, he named as many individuals as he could remember. While Mawney's and Bowen's accounts contain a few errors in detail, they are the only detailed eyewitness narratives from the colonial side. They tell that the men convened at Sabin's Tavern, John Brown organized a flotilla of eight boats, and Abraham Whipple identified himself to the Gaspee lookouts as the Sheriff of Kent County. From the Gaspees crew and officers, there is ample testimony, but Rhode Island's Patriots left only scanty information. Pre-Civil War For four decades leading up to the American Civil War, American historians and Revolutionary Era popularizers agonized over whether their generation was worthy of the founders‚Äô sacrifices. While their sectional divisiveness tore the fragile nation apart, Northerners and Southerners competed to assert possession of the founders‚Äô dream. Massachusetts‚Äô conservative leaders carefully crafted and published American histories that prominently featured New Englanders as the \\"true\\" founders of the entire North American republic.Harlow W. Sheidley, Sectional Nationalism: Massachusetts Conservative Leaders and the Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1836 (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1998) esp. chapter 5. Theirs was an attempt to define the national identity of the young republic through sectional concerns and anxieties. Gaspee Point, pictured in 1852. It was in this era of sectionalism that the Gaspee found its great chronicler. In 1845, Rhode Island Judge William R. Staples published what remains the most accessible (reprinted in 1990), detailed, and best-known work on the Gaspee, the Documentary History of the Destruction of the Gaspee. First appearing in the Providence Daily Journal, his account later appeared as a substantial pamphlet.It first appeared on Tuesday 11 March 1845. Knowles, Vose, and Anthony published the newspaper and the pamphlet. Staples's work contained 56 pages of contemporary correspondence surrounding the events of 1772-73. He graduated from Brown University in Providence, studied law, and was admitted to the bar. Later, he served on Rhode Island's Supreme Court and ultimately became Chief Justice. He helped found the Rhode Island Historical Society, where he served in the roles of secretary, librarian, and vice-president.James Grant Wilson, Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1889‚Äì1900), 651. A more detailed 19-page biographical piece was written by William Greene in 1870 when six of Staples‚Äô eleven children were still living. See \\"Introductory Memoir\\" in William R. Staples, Rhode Island in the Continental Congress (Providence: Providence Press Company, Printers to the State, 1870), xv-xxxiii. Staples‚Äô work is peppered with brief notes of commentary, allowing his own Whig Partygish interpretation of the events to shine through, but he supplies little narrative or analysis in Documentary History. Staples mostly let the historical actors speak for themselves. When he spoke, Staples did not hide his sympathies ascribing just motives to the colonials and sinister ones to royal representatives. When Staples‚Äô work was republished in 1990, Richard M. Deasy wrote an introduction reflecting on the Gaspee and the lasting contribution of Judge Staples‚Äô compilation of documents. Deasy mentioned other maritime attacks on British government property as well as the Dockyards Act of 1772 (see arson in royal dockyards), but he explained the reaction of the Crown to the Gaspee as \\"simply the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.\\"William R. Staples, The Documentary History of the Destruction of the Gaspee, Introduced and Supplemented by Richard M. Deasy. Published jointly by the Rhode Island Publications Society, The Rhode Island Bicentennial Foundation and The Rhode Island Supreme Court Historical Society: (Providence, RI: 1990), xxxii. Fifteen years after Staples, in 1860, Samuel G. Arnold produced a brief treatment of the Gaspee in his History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. He dedicated ten pages to the arrival of the Gaspee in Narragansett Bay, to early troubles with Dudingston and to the destruction of the vessel, the Commission of Inquiry, and Ephraim Bowen's account of that night. Arnold wrote up the Gaspee incident as a chronological narrative with the year, month, and day displayed in the margins (as he did for all of Rhode Island's history). Arnold celebrated the triumph of liberty over tyranny throughout the section on the American Revolution and described Lieutenant Dudingston's wounds as \\"the first British blood shed in the war of independence.\\"Samuel Greene Arnold, History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations Vol II 1700‚Äì1790 (New York: D. Appleton & Company, 1860), 313. Around the same time, from 1856 to 1865, John Russell Bartlett, the Secretary of State of Rhode Island, published Records of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in New England, a ten-volume set. In 1862, volume 7, which covered the years 1770‚Äì1776 was released. In the 136 pages, the Gaspee affair was covered, including a few additional pages of correspondence, not found in Staples, surrounding the destruction of the Gaspee. George Bancroft assisted Bartlett by securing copies of documents in London. A year earlier, Bartlett had published exactly the same pages under the title A History of the Destruction of His Britannic Majesty‚Äôs Schooner Gaspee, in Narragansett Bay, on the 10th June, 1772. Almost identical to Staples's work in content and layout, Bartlett provided more analysis and commentary than the judge's work. Bartlett offered more comments in the footnotes and laid out the text in one column instead of two, making it a 141-page book. In the introduction, Bartlett justified the release of a book similar to Staples's work not because the latter was found wanting but because it was scarce and out of print Given the Whig view of the American Revolution shared by both prestigious Rhode Islanders and most of their readers, they had sufficiently covered the topic for their era, and no full-length treatment for an adult readership of the Gaspee was published thereafter. Their work reflected the more celebratory and confident attitude of the earlier part of 19th century, they did not seem to struggle with living in the shadows of the accomplishments of their parents and grandparents, unlike many others of their generation.This essay has been influenced by the structure and periodization found in a bicentennial lecture given by Michael Kammen at Pennsylvania State University found in Robert Himmer, ed, Perspectives on the American Revolution (York Campus: Pennsylvania State University, 1976), 29-54. Imperial School The period from 1865 to 1900 was a dry spell for historians writing about Rhode Island events leading up to the American War for Independence although there was a significant body of work written on Massachusetts at the time. A great deal of creative energy went into writing about the perceived causes of the Civil War and narratives recalling minute details of every battle Many of the histories were disconnected from longer developments and large secular changes of the 19th century, giving them an antiquarian flavor. Academic historians, on the other hand, were busy professionalizing their discipline. It was during the decades following the Civil War that historical associations (like the American Historical Association in 1884) were founded and many prestigious American universities implemented Ph.D. programs, largely modeled after German institutions. The publication of scholarly journals rose in quantity and quality. Meanwhile, more professional and academic American historians were following in the footsteps of Jared Sparks (1789‚Äì1866) and George Bancroft (1800‚Äì1891) by visiting British archives to uncover the information that officials in London had at their disposal and how they made decisions that affected the North American colonies. Their work, later known as the \\"Imperial School\\" of historical interpretation, provided a more balanced view of the conflict that took into account both the reasonings of the Patriot and Loyalists in their actions alongside that of the British Parliament. George Louis Beer (1872‚Äì1920) and Herbert L. Osgood (1855‚Äì1918) examined the changes in mercantilist ideology among European theorists that influenced the decisions of the Privy Council in dealing with the American colonies. After the Seven Years' War, Britain returned some colonies in the Caribbean to the French but retained Canada, which marked a shift in colonial administration, and new and emerging markets were valued more highly than mere production of resources. Controlling, regulating, and collecting the revenues of colonial markets, the scholars explained, would become divisive points of contention in the 1760s and the 1970s. Early 20th century and \\"progressive\\" interpretations Consequently, it was only in the early 20th century that educational leaders expressed an interest in teaching Rhode Island school children about the Gaspee. In printed curricula, teachers were instructed about how to portray civil disobedience to younger children. According to historian Michael Kammen, the years between 1886 and 1906 marked a time of national \\"obsession with revolutionary America in juvenile fiction.\\"Kammen, Michael \\"The American Revolution in National Tradition\\" in Perspectives on the American Revolution (The York Campus of the Pennsylvania State University, 1976), 43. And in 1908 Horatio B. Knox, an instructor in history and civics at Rhode Island Normal School published a 98-page book on the Gaspee \\"written expressly for the school children of Rhode Island.\\"Knox, Horatio B., The Destruction of the Gaspee (Department of Education: State of Rhode Island, 1908) Many educators believed that immigrant children needed to be taught American democratic values in public school. The first decade of the twentieth century was marked by a patriotism that sometimes lapsed into jingoism. Lesser heroes like John Paul Jones had their remains exhumed and returned to the United States, and the US Navy was expanded and put on display to project the force of a confident nation abroad (see Great White Fleet). Progressive historians in the early 20th century were interested in the veiled and sometimes less veiled economic motives of historical actors. They highlighted the ways in which large, corporate business interests were not always compatible with the interest of common people in a democracy. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. and Charles and Mary Beard used their belief in the economic motivations of historical actors to understand the larger demographic, geographic, and social changes in the colonies. Although no one portrayed the Gaspee incident as a \\"class conflict,\\" it was widely assumed by contemporaries that there were economic motives at the heart of the attack on the Gaspee. Merchants who were pressing charges against Dudingston were not seeking the overthrow of an economic system, merely that they wanted only for Britain to return to its lax pre-1763 enforcement of customs. The attack on the ship was no oppressed class uprising but was the well-heeled merchants of Providence and Newport and their shipmasters challenging the revenue enforcement of the London government. The merchants had numerous family and commercial ties to the colonial legislature and to the governor's office. America's revolutionary heroes, at the turn of the century, were more likely to be portrayed as statesmen and capable politicians, not revolutionaries or radicals. In the years after World War I, many Americans expressed cynicism and dismay over the behavior of American and European \\"statesmen\\" and \\"politicians\\" in their conduct of that war, its human toll, and the profit of military suppliers. America's revolutionary leaders fared better as \\"political outsiders,\\" men who challenged a corrupt government and separated from it. In the years leading up to the Great Depression, Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard published and re- published their massive, 800-page Rise of American Civilization college textbook and made only a one-sentence reference to the Gaspee but allotted five pages to the Boston Tea Party, even making analogies between trade privileges granted to the East India Company in the 18th century with those given to Standard Oil in the nineteenth. While many Americans may have been cynical about having to return to Europe to fight another war only two decades later in 1941, they quickly rallied to defend their belief in democracy and representative government. Not wanting to repeat the painful experiences following World War I, many Americans wanted to return to a postwar America that would be homogeneous and unified. Portrayals of the revolutionary period by historians reflected this cultural shift, and post-1945 historical writing emphasized the constructive nation-building done by thoughtful elites in the late 1780s and downplayed the fiery rhetoric of patriotic hotheads in the 1770s. That made the revolution seem not very \\"revolutionary\\" at all. Oliver M. Dickerson placed the blame for friction in the colonies not on the Navigation Acts, which he argued were functioning well by every assessment, but he accused the new Board of Customs Commissioners of acting like pirates. Dickerson portrayed the American colonies of the New World as prosperous, highly-desirable places to live. The founders must have been reluctant revolutionaries. Gordon S. Wood, in his more recent highly acclaimed work on the radical transformation of colonial society, argued that the British Navigation Acts were working well. He believed that \\"compliance was remarkably high.\\" The American colonists reinforced their support of Britain and the monarchical, hierarchical society in which they lived when they mobilized to assist their King during the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1756. Royal authority was deeply rooted in the mid-18th century in the Thirteen Colonies of North America. While compliance may have been high in many areas, some Rhode Island merchants were not prepared for the type of rigid enforcement of revenue collection that followed the Seven Years' War. While Dudingston's zealous enforcement of custom laws in 1772 may not have been politically popular in Narragansett Bay, Lawrence H. Gipson researched the technical legal grounds for it. He found that Dudingston was well within his jurisdiction to send property seized in Rhode Island to the Vice-Admiralty court in Boston. Gipson, part of the \\"Imperial School,\\" covered the Gaspee incident in more detail in his massive 15-volume history than any other professional historian, devoting 14 pages to it. He found that Rhode Island's colonists erred in their assertions of legal impropriety.Lawrence Henry Gipson, The British Empire Before the American Revolution. Vol. XII The Triumphant Empire: Britain Sails into the Storm, 1770‚Äì1776 (New York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1965) 26 footnote 79. On the other hand, James B. Hedges, in his history of the Brown family, claimed the opposite. He indicated that an Act of Parliament required for seizures to stand trial in the colony in which they were apprehended.James B. Hedges, The Browns of Providence Plantations: Colonial Years (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1952) 208. While both scholars disagreed on technical points, they were in agreement that law was king. Each side, they argued, was trying to promote a more accurate understanding of the relevant legislation. Carl Ubbelohde maintained that the few cases in which Rhode Island business was adjudicated in Judge Robert Auchumuty's Boston courtroom were the exception, not the rule, in colonial Vice-Admiralty courts.Carl Ubbelohde, The Vice-Admiralty Courts and the American Revolution (Chapel Hill, The University of North Carolina Press, 1960) 156. Consensus \\"republican\\" interpretations Edmund Morgan found that a \\"Puritan Ethic\\" was still guiding many of New England's colonists in the 1760s and 1770s. In their nonimportation and nonconsumption rhetoric and in their attacks on luxury and idleness, colonists coalesced around a shared set of American values. Morgan tied the Boston Massacre and the Gaspee to the corrupt American Board of Customs Commissioners. Despite all the varieties and differences among the Patriot leadership, Morgan argued that they had a consensus at a more basic, world-view level. A frugal, hard-working, and virtuous people were not going to stand by while Britain imposed a nonproductive class of idle placeholders over them. Dickerson found the \\"corrupt class\\" to include some of the \\"King‚Äôs Friends,\\" who personally profited from American ships, merchants, and seafarers through the American Board of Customs, causing significant harm to a century of successful Navigation Acts. Republican virtue, it seemed, would be the guiding principle for America's founders. Neo-Whig \\"ideological\\" interpretations Not content to \\"flatten out\\" the complexity and nuances of the Revolutionary period, historians writing in the 1960s and 1970s rehabilitated, in one form or another, all of the previous \\"schools of thought.\\" Whiggish, economic, imperial, and conflict views came back with a new vitality, new evidence, and a new perspective, perhaps colored by the protest movements and crowd action of 1960s America. Colonial elites in the 18th century knew that mobs frequently served the public welfare and understood that they played an integral role in protecting a free society.Pauline Maier, From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765‚Äì1776 (New York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1972) 5. Local uprisings were better defined as extra-institutional, rather than anti-institutional. They were focused and \\"disciplined\\" or at least proportional in the scale of their protests. Historian Pauline Maier built upon the earlier findings of George Rud√© and E. P. Thompson in their research on 18th-century mob and crowd behavior in Britain. Rud√© found that London mobs were not mere tools of elites, outside agents, or conspirators.Rud√©, George, \\"The London 'Mob' of the Eighteenth Century\\" The Historical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1 (1959): 12. They frequently acted with strong social and economic grievances and attacked the property of people they knew personally. They broke windows, \\"pulled down\\" houses, and sometimes burned their victims in effigy. Mobs usually acted and reacted near their homes. Thompson indicated that as more and more of the British economy came under the control of \\"unseen\\" market forces, the traditional \\"paternalistic\\" protectors of the economy were coming under scrutiny for not \\"protecting\\" people from these forces.Thompson, E.P., \\"The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century,\\" Past and Present, No. 50 (February, 1971): 89. In the colonies, Maier noted that three kinds of uprisings pointing toward the revolution that have attracted attention from historians because they directly challenged British authority: restrictions on the use of white pine trees, naval impressments, and customs- related conflicts. The conflicts did not merely engage those on the periphery of American society (seafarers, Blacks, and servants), but colonial elites participated in these protests. Charles Dudley, the customs collector in Newport, was attacked in 1771 not by the \\"lowest class of Men\\" but by the merchants and shipmasters of the port. In 1772, members of the leading merchant family of Providence planned the attack on Dudingston and the Gaspee. In keeping with colonial patterns for local uprisings, the local sheriff immediately identified himself and claimed that he was carrying out his duties by seeking to arrest Dudingston. Some of the attackers may have blackened their faces, another trait of some colonial mobs. Maier noted that the Brown's actions were carried out only as a last resort and after all legal means had failed. Rhode Island merchants and shipmasters had pressed their grievances during the spring of 1772 through civil and military channels to no avail.Pauline Maier, From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765‚Äì1776 (New York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1972) 11. Uprisings were meant to show weaknesses in the government, \\"areas for improvement\\" in which laws needed enforcement. In the case of the Gaspee, the uprising was meant to show where enforcement had been excessive. The desired response from the Crown would have been to relax the enforcement of customs in a colony that depended so much upon navigation. Dudingston was tried and convicted of illegal seizure in a Rhode Island court, and the customs board in Boston paid his fine.Merrill Jensen, The Founding of a Nation: A History of the American Revolution 1763‚Äì1776 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), 426. Maier's work revealed the function the colonial mob served in a society in which the government and police presence was small. Maier turned the idea of a \\"lawless\\" mob on its head and showed that a mob could take limited action in order to maintain law and order. Neo-Imperial interpretation Several history professors and graduate students tried to understand, analyze, and interpret a British and American Loyalist perspective on the Gaspee. Franklin Wickwire wrote an article in 1963 that examined the British perspective on the Gaspee more thoroughly than anyone before or since. He examined the transition from Lord Hillsborough to Lord Dartmouth as Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1772. Dartmouth was not as experienced in colonial affairs as Hillsborough and relied heavily on one of his under- secretaries, John Pownall, the younger brother of colonial governor of Massachusetts Thomas Pownall. By 1772, Pownall had 30 years of experience with American colonial affairs.Franklin B. Wickwire, \\"John Pownall and British Colonial Policy,\\" William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, Vol. 20, Issue 4 (October 1963): 549. Dartmouth and later Lord North relied on Pownall to the point that he was not merely carrying out administrative duties but was writing policy for the colonies. From humble beginnings, Pownall had risen to the high councils of the British government that ultimately brought about the undoing of the first British Empire. When the Privy Council ordered the attorney and solicitor general to draft the commission and the King's proclamation for the Gaspee, Dartmouth left for his country home, assigning the duties to Pownall, who wrote much of the copy, forwarding important documents to Dartmouth merely for his signature. Wickwire's view of the Gaspee incident showed a British ministry in which important directives and orders were delegated to subministers. They were dedicated and competent administrators but had little knowledge about what was actually happening \\"on the ground\\" in the American colonies. Most had never visited the Eastern Seaboard of North America and were not in a good position to judge how their directives were going to be received on the other side of the Atlantic. While John Pownall certainly understood the political culture of the colonies better than many of his superiors, London's officials repeatedly failed to anticipate policy implications and outcome. Neo-Progressives and \\"radical\\" interpretations This same time period saw a resurgence of scholarship that was loosely defined as \\"neo-progressive\\" or \\"radical\\" history. Alfred F. Young, in an introduction to a collection of essays by self-styled radical historians, distinguished between \\"internal radicals\\" and \\"external radicals.\\" The most pro-Independence in the years up to 1776 were radical because of their unwillingness to work within the colonial system. Apart from independence, they were not seeking drastic changes to the social order. Internal radicals, sometimes known to contemporaries as \\"levellers,\\" may or may not have been interested in Patriot grievances against the ministry. They sought a reordering of colonial hierarchies that would allow the \\"outsiders\\" in.Alfred F. Young, The American Revolution: Explorations in the History of American Radicalism (Dekalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 1976), x. Jesse Lemisch portrayed sailors as the quintessential \\"outsiders.\\" While they were not interested in the reordering of society, like black slaves an indentured servants, they were treated like children by the civil codes of the Thirteen Colonies. Lemisch argued that impressment of sailors, especially the capture of colonial citizens who were not mariners, was a key grievance understated by previous authors. The naval impressment by the authorities swayed many Americans to the cause of indepence. One of only two book-length scholarly treatments of the Gaspee was a Ph.D. thesis by Lawrence J. DeVaro.The other is Steven H. Park, The Burning of HBMS Gaspee and the Limits of Eighteenth-Century British Imperial Power (Unpublished Dissertation: University of Connecticut, 2005). Writing most of his chapters in the early 1970s, he was heavily influenced by Bernard Bailyn's The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution. DeVaro argued that the Gaspee had a greater impact in Britain than in America. Where Patriots saw Crown actions as a conspiracy to subvert their court system and trial in the vicinage, ministry officials saw the attack on the Gaspee as a conspiracy to weaken royal authority in New England.Lawrence J. DeVaro, Jr., The Impact of the Gaspee Affair on the Coming of the Revolution, 1772‚Äì1773 (Unpublished Dissertation: Case Western Reserve University, 1973), 296. Previous attacks, even ones in Rhode Island, were not considered treason. While some rewards had been posted in the past for information leading to an arrest, none was followed by a Royal Commission, unlike the Gaspee. Exaggerated and erroneous reports were taken to London that overestimated the number of participants, the seriousness of Dudingston's wounds, and misidentified the location of the attack. The reports made it difficult for the commission to execute its duties properly. Even as it went about its inquiry, local residents overestimated the power delegated to the commissioners. The historian David Lovejoy, using the Newport Mercury, showed how many residents in Providence and Newport were expecting the worst possible outcome from the commission. The Newport pastor Ezra Stiles, indicated to Reverend Elihu Spencer that \\"no one justifies the burning of the Gaspee. But none ever thought of such a Thing as being Treason.\\"Stiles quoted in DeVaro, 325. In 2014, Gerald Horne, the Moores Professor of History and African- American Studies at the University of Houston, published his book The Counter- Revolution of 1776: Slave Resistance and the Origins of the United States of America.Horne, Gerald. The Counter-revolution of 1776: Slave Resistance and the Origins of the United States of America. New York: New York UP, 2014. 203-208. Print. Arguing that the American Revolution was in fact a counterrevolution and that the taxes levied against the colonies were meant as a move concurrent with the development of British abolitionism, he dedicated five pages to the discussion of the Gaspee attack. New information provided includes the revelation that John Brown's boat, The Hannah, was newly returned from a voyage to Africa and that the attack had occurred concurrently with a major decision in the British Parliament on the abolition of slavery, emphasizing that the American colonists were greatly concerned that the freeing of Africans would result in violent retribution on the part of freed slaves. Horne also dedicates several pages to retelling the attack from the point of view of Aaron Briggs, an indentured Afro-Indian, who later attempted to testify against the attack party to gain manumission from his servitude.

And its performance includes complicated rites and rituals. The peculiar drum-beats can be heard up to a distance of 2 km from where the performance of the Vishnumoorthi Theyyam takes place. The enactment involving the Narasimha Avatar of Lord Vishnu by the Koladhari especially thrills the devotees and the spectators as a result of the body movements involved in it. Vishnumoorthi theyyam at Muzhappilangad  Story of Vishnumoorthi  Vishnumoorthy Theyyam The most popular part of the Vaishnava Theyyam is the depiction of Vishnumoorthi. It is associated with Nileshwar and Jeppu Kudupady - Mangalore. It tells the story of Palanthai Kannan, a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. Palanthai Kannan, a native of Nileshwar in his boyhood, tried to pick mangoes from a mango tree owned by Kuruvat Kurup. Without considering his age or the thirst for food, Kuruvat Kurup and his bodyguards beat him and drove away from Nileshwar. After that incident, Palanthai Kannan went to Jeppu Kudupady - Mangalore, kunchadka - Sullia and took shelter in a Vishnu temple there. When there, he obtained the blessings of Lord Vishnu and years later, he returned to his homeland, Nileshwar. On the way, Palanthai Kannan stayed one day in Moolapally in the house of a black smith [now near the railway line] and rested in the Kanakkappalli Anikkil Tharavadu [situated near the Nileshwar bus stand, on the Koroth - N.H. Road, and once up on a time famous as a center of martial arts and education]. Then he proceeded to Kundon Kadavu and leaving his Olakkuda [umbrella] and Churika [shield], went to Kadalikulam [a pond near Nileshwar Market junction] for taking bath. Within a short time the news of the arrival of Palanthai Kannan spread in the all across Nileshwar. Hearing the news, Kuruvat Kurup and his men came to the Kadalikulam and killed Palanthai Kannan. The God Vishnu who accompanied his ardent devotee Palanthai Kannan was provoked and destroyed the everything near by Kuruvat tharavad.Kuruvat kurup was frightened and called up an astrologer. He identified the presents of God and advised Kurup to a make a Kettikkolam for lord Vishnu and build a shrine for the God.Kuruvat kurup and his family members build a shrine for the god Vishnu by carrying stones by themselves and also made a Kettikkolam for the God. That time onwards, he became known as the Vishnumoorthi and began to reside in Vaikundeswara Temple, Kottappuram, Nileshwar. Vishnumoorthi theyyam is also believed to be The Narasinha Avatar of Lord Mahavishnu who came to save his dear devotee Prahlada from his father,The Asura king Hiranya Kasipu by breaking the pillar. This Theyyakolam is dancing all major maniyani (Yadava's Tharavadu, Theeyya and Nair Tharavadu). This kolam was worn by Malayan in special community.

His work on the isotopes of hydrogen has enhanced the understanding of the origin of water and of organic matter in the solar system. He is famous for his work on lithium, beryllium and boron, light elements formed by the irradiation of interstellar matter. He received a Leonard Medal from the Meteoritical Society in 2011 for his work on the isotopic composition of stable nuclei. Career He began his thesis in 1975 in the CEA Saclay under the direction of Marc Javoy and Liliane Merlivat and edited by Samuel Epstein at Caltech, Pasadena, California. He joined the CNRS in 1980 at the Laboratory of stable isotope geochemistry at the University of Jussieu, where he defended his thesis on the isotopic compositions (H, C, N) of carbonaceous meteorites in 1982. Between 1983 and 1990, he worked successively with Liliane Merlivat in Saclay, Samuel Epstein at the California Institute of Technology and Marc Javoy at Jussieu. In 1990 he became a Directeur de Recherche in the CNRS. In 1992 he worked for a few months in Thiruvananthapuram, India, where he created a laboratory for isotopic analysis. He was assigned in 1993 to the Laboratory of Mineralogy of the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) led by Professor Jacques Fabri√®s. Between 1993 and 2004, he collaborated with the Research Center for Petrology and Geochemistry in Nancy (CNRS / INPL). Under the leadership of Professor Stephen Roth he participated in the establishment of the French Society for Stable Isotopes of which he became the Senior Vice President in 1999. In 1999, he undertook the determination of the molecular structure of the insoluble organic matter of meteorites in collaboration with the Laboratory of Organic and Inorganic Geochemistry of the Environment at the University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris. In 2006, he became responsible for a consortium of French laboratories set up by CNES, which set itself the goal of analysis of samples from the halo of Comet Wild 2 captured by the U.S. Stardust space mission (NASA). Between 2003 and 2011, he was successively elected member of the Board of Directors and the Scientific Council of the MNHN and Chairman of the National Program of Planetology (PNP / CNRS-INSU). Since 2004 he has been Director of the Laboratory of Mineralogy and Cosmochemistry of the Museum, in which there is a NanoSims (Cameca) ion probe accessible to national and international researchers as part of the National Analysis Service of the INSU-CNRS.

The major goal of the Early Childhood Division is to learn academic and social skills, Language Arts, Math, Science, French, Yoga, Art, and Music. Lower School core subjects are Math, Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts. Special subjects include Music, Art, French, Library, Technology, and Physical Education. Upper School students follow an in-depth curriculum, which includes English, Math, Science, History, French, Physical Education, Art, and Music, along with arts electives, clubs, which include a student government, and a yearly Independent Study Project, where students choose a topic and research it throughout the year.  Athletics  The athletics curriculum includes Physical Education for grades 1-5, and Soccer, Cross Country, Basketball, Fitness, and Track for grades 6-8. Dance instruction is offered as part of the school's traditional celebrations. St. Peter regularly participates in interscholastic competition with many schools throughout the Philadelphia area.  Facilities and campus  The Main Building is located at 319 Lombard Street, housing academic classrooms, Admissions, STEAM Lab, Science Lab and Administrative Offices. The Alumni Theater is for performances, assemblies, Declamation, and special events. The Robert B. Blum Library is used for Preschool - 6th Grade library classes. It is open to all students. Gymnasium: St. Peter's Schools' sports facilities include a regulation-sized gymnasium and locker rooms located at the Old Pine Community Center. Physical Education classes for all students grades K‚Äì8 take place in the gymnasium, as do home basketball games. Old Pine Community Center houses the school's indoor athletic facilities and sits just across 4th Street from the school's main academic building. St. Peter's School maintains use of the center's gymnasium, Wasson Hall meeting space, and classrooms for Special classes. The Sally Wiggins Turf Field, also called the West Lawn, is a large green space on campus which houses a playground and organic gardens. The school uses the West Lawn and the nearby athletic fields at Starr Garden for outdoor athletic activities. Festive events are also held on Wiggins Field and in Starr Garden throughout the school year. St. Peter's Church and St. Peter's School share a long history. Although the two institutions separated formally in 2017 when St. Peter's School became a fully independent non-denominational school, the two institutions continue to collaborate. The school uses the church for school assemblies known as 'School Service', annually for the Celebration of Light, and Graduation.

He was a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea from 2007 to 2017, representing the electorate of Sumkar Open. He was Minister for Housing and Urban Development in Peter O'Neill's first ministry in 2011, but was subsequently dropped from Cabinet. He was first elected to the National Parliament in the 2007 general election, as independent MP for the Sumkar Open constituency in Madang Province, though he subsequently joined the People's National Congress Party. His election was notable as he defeated Jerry Singirok to take the seat. (Singirok was the Commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force during the Sandline affair of 1997, when there were fears the army might overthrow Prime Minister Julius Chan's government.)\\"Triumphant Somare\\" , Islands Business\\"NA ahead on 8\\" , Post-Courier, 24 July 2007\\"Melanesia in Review: Issues and Events, 2010\\", The Contemporary Pacific, vol. 23, n¬∞2, autumn 2011\\"16 first time MPs get into Cabinet\\" , Post-Courier, 9 August 2011 Initially a government backbencher, he withdrew his support from Sir Michael Somare's coalition government in June 2010, in protest over amendments to the Environment Act, which he said had been undemocratically \\"bulldozed through Parliament\\". Under the amendments, if the authorities granted a company permission to exploit resources on particular lands, landowners would have no recourse to challenge the permit in court. Fairweather said the amendments deprived the people of their rights, and would lead to harmful environmental damage; Environment and Conservation Minister Benny Allen responded that they were in the \\"national interest\\". Fairweather announced he would be sitting on Parliament's \\"middle benches\\", rather than specifically joining the Opposition.\\"PNG politician quits over environmental policy\\", Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 17 June 2010 In January 2011, he stood as candidate for the position of Governor of Madang Province, to succeed to Sir Arnold Amet, who had just been appointed Attorney General and Minister for Justice. He was defeated by James Gau, deputy Minister for Works, who obtained eighteen votes to Fairweather's eight in the provincial assembly.\\"Gau is Madang Governor elect\\" , Post-Courier, 5 January 2011 In April 2011, Amet organised a meeting in Madang so that landowners potentially affected by a proposed Pacific Marine Industrial Zone could express their views and concerns to members of the government. As local MP, Fairweather attended, and criticised the project, describing it as a \\"con-job\\" which would not benefit his constituents. He also described Gabriel Kapris (the Minister for Commerce and Industry, who was present) as a stil-man, a Tok Pisin word for a thief. Amet responded by calling Fairweather, who is white, \\"a white millionaire that the people do not need\\", telling him: \\"You pack up and you leave my island. [...] You don't belong here\\". He added that a white person could never understand the country, and thus could not provide the services that the people needed. (This was disputed by villagers, who pointed out that, under Fairweather, they had benefited from new school facilities, roads, and a greater access to water supplies.) The exchange, which had been filmed, was posted on YouTube, and made front page news in the Post-Courier, the country's largest-selling daily newspaper. The paper described Amet's words as \\"shamefully wrong and unbecoming of a state minister, especially coming from the former Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea\\".

Though the LL.M. in Dispute Resolution program is primarily intended for lawyers, CSDR also accepts applicants who are non lawyers, but otherwise have bachelor's degrees and substantial alternative dispute resolution experience. Research The University of Missouri Columbia School of Law in conjunction with the Center for the Study of Dispute Resolution publishes The Journal of Dispute Resolution on a semi-annual basis (December and May).

Life  Wartislaw VIII was the second son of Duke Wartislaw VI of Pomerania-Wolgast and his wife, Anne of Mecklenburg-Stargard. His father initially intended that Wartislaw would join the clergy. At the age of 14, he was appointed the Archdeacon at Tribsees. But in 1393 he left the clergy to marry.

During their joint reign, they sometimes joined the Hanseatic League in the fight against the piracy. Sometimes, however, Duke Barnim VI himself operated as a pirate, leading to a tense relationship with the Hanseatic League and the Teutonic Knights. Barnim VI died in 1405. After his brother's death, Wartislaw VIII ruled Pomerania- Wolgast alone, and acted as guardian for his brother's two sons Wartislaw IX (born: 1400) and Barnim VII (born: ). He settled his dispute with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights in March 1406 and undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where Pope Gregory XII gave him a Golden Rose. After his return, Wartislaw gave the Golden Rose to the Pudagla Monastery, where it was soon revered as miraculous. It was later destroyed by abbott Henry, who ruled 1479‚Äì1493, because it had become an idol.Joachim Zdrenka: Die Pilgerfahrten der pommerschen Herz√∂ge ins Heilige Land in den Jahren 1392/1993 und 1406/1407, in: Baltische Studien, issue 81 N.F., 1995, , p. 15. During his reign, there was an incident in Stralsund, known as the . Ans angry crowd burned three priests at the stake. Wartislaw mediated an atonement in 1409, but could not settle the issue permanently. In the struggle between the Dukes of Pomerania-Stettin, i.e. Swantibor III and later his sons Otto II and Casimir V against Elector Frederick I of the Mark Brandenburg, Wartislaw sided with the latter. In 1413, he concluded an alliance with Frederick and Wartislaw's oldest son, also named Wartislaw, was engaged to Frederick's daughter Margaret. However, Wartislaw junior died one or two years later, before he could marry Margaret. Wartislaw VIII and Frederick travelled together to the Council of Constance, where Emperor Sigismund invested Wartislaw as Duke of Pomerania. However, Wartislaw then had to travel back to Pomerania to deal with riots and could not participate with the Council, such as the burning of the heretic John Huss. Duke Wartislaw VIII died on 20 August 1415. He was buried in the St. Peter's Church in Wolgast. After his death, his widow Agnes and regency council acted as regent for his own sons Barnim VIII and Swantibor IV as well as his brother's sons Wartislaw IX and Barnim VII, until Wartislaw IX, the eldest of the four, took over in 1417.

Built by the Nicolson family, who were responsible for clearing Fetlar of many of its inhabitants, it has been disused since the 1980s. The Brough Lodge Trust has recently started work to restore the building. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History Brough Lodge, with the Tower on the right In 1805, parts of the island of Fetlar were acquired by the Nicolson family, a well-established Shetland family who also owned Papa Stour among other lands. The land was given to the Nicolsons by Andrew Bruce of Urie, in payment of a debt. Arthur Nicolson (1794‚Äì1863) evicted many of the island's tenants on his estate, enclosing the land for sheep farming. He lived at Urie in the north of the island, until Brough Lodge was completed around 1820. In 1826 he was recognised as a baronet, the heir of Sir James Nicolson, 7th Baronet, who had died in 1743. Brough Lodge was built in the Gothic Revival style, with crenellated walls and bartizans at the corners. Details in Classical and Moorish styles were added to the facades and screen walls, as well as a brick- built chapel. Around 1840, Sir Arthur Nicolson constructed a folly, known as The Tower, on a small hill to the north-east of the lodge. The Tower is built over the remains of an Iron Age broch, and was later used as an observatory. A second folly, the Round House, was built at Gruting in the eastern part of the island, and was later used as an estate office. The lodge and its outbuildings are described as \\"Shetland's most unusual group of 19th century buildings.\\" After Sir Arthur died in 1863, the Fetlar estate was left to his widow, Eliza Jane Nicolson (d.1891), who lived in England. On her death it was inherited by Sir Arthur Nicolson, 10th Baronet (1842‚Äì1917). The son of the 9th Baronet, Sir Arthur was born in Australia, but spent time living on Fetlar. From the 1890s, finding Brough Lodge in poor condition due to neglect, he undertook renovations. His wife Lady Annie kept a detailed diary of life at Brough Lodge during these years. The lodge continued to be occupied occasionally by the Nicolsons until the death of Lady Jean, widow of Sir Stanley Nicolson, 12th Baronet, in 1987, since when it has been empty. A large number of artefacts and documents were removed from the house, and are now held in the Fetlar Museum. In 1997 a local initiative to restore the building was begun, and the Brough Lodge Trust was established. Lady Jean's heir transferred ownership of Brough Lodge to the trust in 2007, which plans to use the building as a multi- purpose commercial venue. Proposals to make the building weatherproof, costed at ¬£380,000, were supported by Shetland Islands Council, and fundraising efforts included a concert by Scots musicians Aly Bain and Phil Cunningham. In August 2011 it was announced that Historic Scotland would fund the rest of the project, and that work was about to commence.

Brigham Bishop) is best known as an American composer of popular music. Various disputed claims have been made by Bishop and others that he authored, or at least contributed to the authorship of, a number of popular 19th-century songs, including John Brown's Body, When Johnny Comes Marching Home, and Shoo Fly, Don't Bother Me. Bishop later had an infamous career as a bucket shop proprietor, among other schemes. Background Bishop was born in Wayne (Kennebec County) Maine in 1835.(11 June 1905). Extraordinary Career of Florida Bank Wrecker, Pensacola Journal and began studying music in Providence, Rhode Island when he was 16. In 1864, he founded a minstrel show in Chattanooga, which lasted until Lincoln's assassination.Andreas, Alfred Thomas. History of Chicago, Vol. III, p. 664 (1886)William L. Slout Burnt Cork and Tambourines: A Source Book of Negro Ministrelsy, p. 46 (2007) Songs While Bishop did publish a number of songs beginning in the 1850s,The World's best music: famous songs and those who made them, Volume 4 (1903) disputes have arisen over his authorship claims as to some of the most famous of those compositions. In some cases, it is fairly clear that Bishop was not the original author of the works in dispute. In other cases the facts are not clear.(23 June 1901). A Last Minstrel, Reading Eagle (very colorful 1901 story about Bishop's musical claims, probably authored by John J. MacIntyre) =\\"John Brown's Body\\"= Bishop has often been attributed with authorship of the popular Civil War marching song \\"John Brown's Body\\", though that claim is widely disputed.The Oxford companion to English literature, p. 141 (2006)(\\"The author of the song is unknown, but it is most frequently attributed to Thomas B. Bishop (1835-1905) of Portland; set to an old Methodist hymn-tune, it became the most popular marching song of the Federal forces.\\")Cornelius, Steven. Music of the Civil War era, p. 26-30 (2004)(25 October 1929). The Battle Song of John Brown, The New York Times The melody of the song was famously also used for The Battle Hymn of the Republic. In 1916, Bishop's friend John J. MacIntyre published a short book promoting Bishop's authorship of John Brown's Body and other songs, boldly called The Composer of the Battle Hymn of the Republic.MacIntyre, John J. The Composer of the Battle Hymn of the Republic (William H. Conklin, 1916) MacIntyre also promoted Bishop's authorship claims in 1935, for the 100th anniversary of Bishop's birth, which was featured in an article in Time magazine.(1 July 1935). Hymn From Maine, Time (magazine) Bishop's story of the genesis of the song is that it grew out of a conversation with his brother-in-law around 1858, who \\"took me to task, remarking that my songs were all written for the devil. Then he said 'I am bound to be a soldier in the army of the Lord.' Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!'\\" This, according to Bishop, inspired him to the melody and lyrics, and he later modified the lyrics after John Brown's death at Harper's Ferry in 1859. Bishop claimed he first published the song with John Church of Cincinnati in 1861. =\\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\"= Sheet music cover page for \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" (1863), attributed to \\"Louis Lambert\\" The Civil- War tune \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" is usually attributed to composer and bandmaster Patrick Gilmore (though from a melody derived from the older Irish song Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye), but other attributions to Bishop have also been made.Program- Cleveland Orchestra (1943)Hart, James D. & Leininger, Phillip. The Oxford companion to American literature, p. 70 (6th Ed. 1995)Cazden, Norman et al. Folk songs of the Catskills, p.367-69 (1982). An 1863 publication of the song attributes authorship to a \\"Louis Lambert.\\" According to Bishop, he wrote the melody for the song in 1850, as \\"Johnny, Fill Up the Bowl,\\" Gilmore wrote new lyrics for it in 1863, and both brought the song to their publisher, who reportedly suggested that the Lambert pseudonym be used on the sheet music. =\\"Shoo Fly, Don't Bother Me\\" = Sheet music cover page for \\"Shoo Fly\\" (1869) According to Bishop's account, he wrote \\"Shoo Fly, Don't Bother Me\\" during the Civil War while assigned to command a company of black soldiers. One of the soldiers, dismissing some remarks of his fellow soldiers, exclaimed \\"Shoo fly, don't bother me,\\" which inspired Bishop to write the song. The company, we are told, generated the line \\"I belong to Company G\\". Yet, the song was reportedly \\"pirated\\" from Bishop and he made little money from it.(8 November 1905). The Author of \\"Shoo Fly\\", Reading Eagle (stating that T. Allston Brown, had vouched for this account) Bishop did publish a sheet music version of the song in 1869, which includes the caption, \\"Original Copy and Only Authorized Edition.\\"Shoo Fly, Duke University library collection Other sources, however, have credited Billy Reeves (lyrics) and Frank Campbell, or Rollin Howard, with the song.The blue book of Tin Pan Alley, p. 9 (1965) The first group to popularize the song was Bryant's Minstrels in 1869‚Äì70.Cropsey, Eugene H. Crosby's Opera House: symbol of Chicago's cultural awakening, p. 270 (1999) =MacIntyre's reporting= Cover to sheet music for \\"Six new songs\\" by Bishop, published by H. Pilcher and Sons, St. Louis, 1857. Writer John J. MacIntyre's 1916 short book, The Composer of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, about Bishop's songs, appears to be written largely based on Bishop's self-reporting to MacIntyre many years after the fact. MacIntrye reports therein that he first met Bishop in 1897 in New York. Perhaps the most amazing of the claims in the book is that Bishop had a small part in the writing of one of the Stephen Foster's best known songs, Old Folks at Home (\\"Swanee River\\"). Bishop claims that he ran into Foster in a music publishing house, where Foster had already composed the lyrics and basic melody, and whistled it to Bishop, who \\"put it down\\" on paper for him, and arranged it for piano by adding basic chords. Then, according to Bishop, famed blackface performer E.P. Christy walked in, heard the song, and paid Foster $30 for it on the spot. Thus, the song was attributed to E.P. Christy when it was published (which, at the very least, is true; the original sheet music, dated 1851, attributes authorship to Christy). If any of this story was true, Bishop would have been only about 16 years old at the time of this event, and it contradicts other sources which make no mention of Bishop. Business endeavors By the 1880s, Bishop became engaged in the \\"bucket shop\\" business‚Äîessentially a betting business based on the stock market. Bishop reportedly became the \\"leader\\" of the shady (and eventually illegal) trade in New York City, and also specialized in female customers.(4 November 1882) Advertisement, New York Daily Graphic (\\"T. Brigham Bishop & Co. (of Boston) have opened a special banking house for ladies.\\") Bishop was arrested in mid-1890 for charges arising out of legal proceedings brought against him for taking $2,000 from a Julie E. Hetsch in 1885,(25 July 1890). Should Have Staid Away, The New York Times(25 July 1890). T. Brigham Bishop Jailed, Meriden Daily Republican but was able to skip town once bond was posted. He was again arrested in Jersey City, New Jersey in November 1891 and placed in Ludlow Street Jail, where the New York Times critique of Bishop's financial career was withering: \\"Bishop has had a long career as a confidence man, bunko steerer, and general crook. He has made Massachusetts, Ohio, and Florida too hot to hold him.\\"(6 November 1891). A Long Career As A Crook: Bucket-Shop Keeper Bishop in Ludlow Street Jail, The New York TimesFayant, Frank.
