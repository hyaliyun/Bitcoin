His strong leadership abilities had a dominating effect on the character of his department, in which he served for all but a few months of his career. His principal interest during this time was the Police service, for which he created the Police Staff College at Bramshill. At his best in a crisis, his contribution to the recovery after the North Sea flood of 1953 was particularly praised. A man of great energy and drive, Newsam's tendency to be impatient with those who disagreed with him meant that he was not automatically popular with the Home Secretaries under whom he worked. However, his negotiating ability was superb, and he allowed himself time to enjoy the finer things in life. His eventual successor Philip Allen regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of trouble at all costs.A. W. Brian Simpson, \\"In the Highest Degree Odious\\", Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 41-2. Simpson quotes a memorable clerihew about Newsam written by J. M. Ross of the Home Office: Sir Frank Newsam Affected to look gruesome, Which carried great weight With successive Secretaries of State. Education and war service Newsam was born in Barbados, where his father William Elias Newsam held a post in the British Colonial Service. He went to school at Harrison College in Barbados, and then won an open scholarship in classics to St John's College, Oxford in 1911. Newsam graduated in 1915 with second classes in each of Mods and Greats,Allen of Abbeydale, \\"Newsam, Sir Frank Aubrey (1893‚Äì1964)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn., January 2008, accessed 12 June 2009. his failure to take a first being later ascribed to his desire to enjoy life while at university.Austin Strutt, \\"Newsam, Sir Frank Aubrey (1893‚Äì1964)\\", Dictionary of National Biography 1961‚Äì1970, Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 791-3. Newsam (who had been a member of the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps) was then commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment. He saw active service in Ireland and was wounded during the Easter Rising in 1916; during the First World War he served in Belgium, France, the Punjab and Afghanistan. In September 1918, while a Lieutenant, he was awarded the Military Cross; the citation referred to him going \\"forward collecting all stragglers and reorganising the line when one of the companies commenced to retire\\", so restoring the offensive capability of his unit. Late in the war, Newsam served with the first battalion of the 30th Punjabis in India (in October 1919 he was promoted to the rank of Captain in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers). He served again in Ireland after the armistice, but after demobilisation in 1919 he joined the teaching staff at Harrow School under Dr Lionel Ford.\\"Sir Frank Newsam\\" (obituary), The Times, 27 April 1964, p. 19. Newsam was at Harrow for only a brief period while waiting for the result of the Class I Competition for the Home Civil Service. In July 1920 he was informed that he had passed, and he then joined the Children's Division of the Home Office. Early career Newsam made his mark in the division, and in 1924 was picked by the then Permanent Secretary Sir John Anderson, as Anderson's own private secretary. Having come to trust Newsam's abilities, Anderson retained him in this post despite Newsam's promotion to principal in 1925. There were some who saw him as a \\"power behind the throne\\" in assisting Anderson. In 1927, Anderson placed Newsam in an even more pivotal post as Principal Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs (Home Secretary) ‚Äì responsible for administering the office of the political head of the department. Newsam held this key position for over five years, assisting Home Secretaries William Joynson-Hicks ('Jix'), J. R. Clynes, Sir Herbert Samuel, and Sir John Gilmour. Especially after Anderson left in 1932 (his successor Sir Russell Scott came from the Treasury with little knowledge of the operation of the Home Office), no other civil servant rivalled his experience. For his part, Newsam learned a great deal about the operations of senior politicians and of Parliament. Assistant Secretary A round of changes in civil service appointments at the Home Office in June 1933 saw Newsam, now promoted\\"Changes At The Home Office\\", The Times, 8 June 1933, p. 14. to Assistant Secretary, take charge of a new division. His first responsibility was to guide into law the Betting and Lotteries Act 1934, but he soon began to handle other sensitive matters. He was also appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1933 Queen's Birthday Honours. Newsam sat on a departmental committee of inquiry into Firearms in 1934,\\"Definition Of Firearms\\", The Times, 3 February 1934, p. 12. and this was followed by the problem of addressing the disorder caused by fighting between members of the British Union of Fascists and its opponents. Newsam played a large role in devising and then implementing the Public Order Act 1936, which banned all political uniforms and was seen as effective in returning order to the streets. World War II 1938 saw Newsam moved to take charge of the criminal division, where he began preparations for a major Criminal Justice Bill; however the advancing threat of war led to it being put off (in the event, most of the provisions were enacted in the Criminal Justice Act 1948). Late in 1938, Newsam was selected as Principal Officer in the South Eastern Civil Defence region; this role meant that should war break out, he would be Chief of Staff to the Regional Commissioner. He duly took up his post in September 1939 but after only a few months in Tunbridge Wells, he was recalled to London to take charge of the criminal and aliens divisions, now with the rank of Assistant Under-Secretary of State. In April 1941 Newsam's appointment to Deputy Under-Secretary of State was announced.\\"The Home Office\\", The Times, 21 April 1941, p. 5. He was now the second most senior civil servant in the Home OfficeSee, e.g., Guy Liddell's diary entry for 4 August 1943 in which Liddell arranges to inform Newsam about MI5's 'Plan Bunbury', involving blowing up a decoy power station ‚Äì vol. II, p. 94. and had a special responsibility for security. Newsam negotiated with the United States how to handle criminal offences committed by American soldiers in the United Kingdom, the agreement being enacted in the United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act 1942. With the Home Office responsible for relations with the Crown Dependencies, Newsam drew up plans for the restoration of life in the Channel Islands once German occupation was ended. Newsam's plans were subsequently put into effect in 1945, and led to a long association with the islands where he helped reform constitutions and develop their legal and administrative systems. Having been in charge of internment of enemy aliens and suspected fascist sympathisers under Defence Regulation 18B, Newsam had in 1944 to consider the vexed question of what to do with the 'Red Book' containing the membership list from Archibald Maule Ramsay's 'Right Club', after Ramsay was released from detention. After discussing the question with a colleague, the idea came up that it may be necessary to illegally destroy the book and then take the chance that Ramsay would get only token damages out of any legal action that might ensue. In the end, the book was returned to Ramsay.Richard Griffiths, \\"Patriotism Perverted\\", Constable, 1998, p. 309-10. Newsam became Sir Frank in 1943 when he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours. =Policing= It was towards the end of the war that Newsam's particular interest in the police force began to take shape. His first task was to reform the large number of very small police forces, as many municipal boroughs that were not especially large had a separate constabulary. Wartime powers had forced some to amalgamate, but Newsam needed to go further. Conscious that a Whitehall takeover was feared, in May 1945 he spoke to the conference of the Chief Constables' Association to reassure them that there would be no regional or national police forces.\\"News in brief\\", The Times, 1 June 1945, p. 2. He eventually drafted the Police Act 1946 which abolished nearly all the borough police forces outside County boroughs, and allowed for more amalgamations. Once the Act was passed, Newsam again reassured the police that there was no question of regionalisation or nationalisation because \\"such an idea is an anathema to the Home Office\\".\\"No State Police Force\\", The Times, 27 September 1946, p. 2. Meanwhile, Newsam also looked into the whole policing service from 1944, and became personally committed to the idea of establishing a national staff college for the police.See the white paper \\"Higher Training for the Police Service in England and Wales\\" (Cmnd. 7070), published 20 March 1947. He saw that the project found the land needed for its buildings (at Bramshill, near Hartley Wintney in Hampshire), and became the founder chairman of the Board of Governors of the Police Staff College in 1947.\\"Police College Board Of Governors\\", The Times, 25 August 1947, p. 2. He retained this role for the rest of his career. Permanent Secretary On 10 August 1948 it was announced that Sir Alexander Maxwell was to retire at the end of September, and that Newsam had been appointed to follow him as Permanent Secretary at the Home Office.\\"Sir Alexander Maxwell To Retire\\", The Times, 11 August 1948, p. 4. In effect this was a delayed promotion; Newsam was already 54, and might easily have reached the rank earlier. At first he had to deal with Chuter Ede as Home Secretary, with whom he had an uneasy relationship (Ede was believed not to trust Newsam's judgment). With Ede maintaining control over the department, Newsam had to deal with routine matters including presenting evidence to the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming.\\"Growth Of Pool Betting\\", The Times, 21 July 1949, p. 3. However Newsam did make an important contribution to British relations with Northern Ireland after Taoiseach John A. Costello revealed his government's intention to declare Ireland a Republic. In discussions in December 1948, Newsam first suggested passing a law declaring that Northern Ireland could not be removed from the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Such a provision was included in the Ireland Act 1949.Ronan Fanning, \\"The Response of the London and Belfast Governments to the Declaration of the Republic of Ireland, 1948‚Äì49\\", International Affairs, vol. 58 no. 1 (Winter 1981-2), pp. 95‚Äì114, esp. p. 107. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1950 New Year Honours. Conservative government After the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, Newsam's activity and knowledge of his department enabled him to assert himself and he was thought to have almost eclipsed the Home Secretaries who were nominally superior. Newsam preferred to deal direct with the Home Secretary, eschewing even the junior Ministers in the department.Anthony Seldon, \\"Churchill's Indian Summer\\", Hodder and Stoughton, 1981, pp. 107, 121. In 1954, Newsam accepted the invitation to write a book explaining the work of the Home Office for \\"The New Whitehall Series\\", a series intended \\"to provide authoritative descriptions of the present work of the major Departments of the Central Government\\" published by George Allen & Unwin Ltd; his was the first to appear.Sir Frank Newsam, \\"The Home Office\\", George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1954, frontispiece. =Capital punishment= One of Newsam's principal concerns was the operation of capital punishment. While Deputy Under-Secretary he had strongly advised against reprieving John Amery, son of a leading Conservative politician who had pleaded guilty to treason during World War II; he believed that reprieving Amery would be a weak move that would look like a political fix.Mary Kenny, \\"Germany Calling\\", New Island, Dublin, 2003, p. 238. Note that Kenny mis- spells Newsam's surname as 'Newsum'. He also opposed a reprieve for William Joyce (nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw), convicted of treason for propaganda broadcasting during the war.Mary Kenny, \\"Germany Calling\\", New Island, Dublin, 2003, p. 13. In 1949 Newsam gave evidence for the Home Office at the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment under Sir Ernest Gowers, largely defending the established system.\\"Death Penalty Inquiry\\", The Times, 5 August 1949, p. 2. Once he became Permanent Secretary, Newsam had personal involvement in the process whereby the Home Secretary decided whether to reprieve those condemned to death; for instance, he signed the letters informing the prisoners' families of the Home Secretary's decision.William George Bentley, \\"My Son's Execution\\", W.H. Allen, 1957, p. 147-9. William Bentley protests at the callousness and inhumanity of the Home Office sending the letter by ordinary post (rather than by special messenger) on a Saturday so that it arrived on Monday, only two days before the date fixed for execution of the death sentence; he also notes that the family were receiving thousands of letters at this point and that the 'O.H.M.S.' envelope was lost among them. However he does not identify Newsam personally with this treatment. He also received the families and legal representatives of those condemned to death while they pleaded for a reprieve from the Home Secretary. On 12 July 1955, Newsam was summoned back from Ascot Racecourse to meet Ruth Ellis' solicitor who wished to present new evidence.Jonathan Goodman and Patrick Pringle, \\"The Trial of Ruth Ellis\\" (Celebrated Trials Series), David & Charles, 1974, p. 66. In another murder case, William Bentley wrote that Newsam spent an hour with him and his daughter while they related the difficult medical history of his condemned son Derek Bentley, and that \\"Sir Frank listened sympathetically, but made no comment\\".William George Bentley, \\"My Son's Execution\\", W.H. Allen, 1957, p. 153. Material released by the Public Record Office in 1992 revealed that Newsam had argued for a reprieve with the words \\"My own view is towards leniency\\".John Mullin, Richard Norton-Taylor, \\"Home Secretary ignored officials' reprieve advice\\", The Guardian, 2 October 1992. Philip Allen later wrote that Newsam was \\"gravely concerned\\" when Home Secretary David Maxwell Fyfe disregarded his recommendation and refused to reprieve Bentley. As a civil servant, Newsam's own views on capital punishment were not public. Long after Newsam's death, an academic journal article reported three separate views of people who knew Newsam well, all of whom believed that he supported retaining capital punishment.Victor Bailey, \\"The Shadow of the Gallows: The Death Penalty and the British Labour Government, 1945‚Äì51\\", Law and History Review, University of Illinois Press, vol. 18 no. 2 (Summer 2000), p. 330. Towards the end of his career, Newsam developed the important distinction between capital and non-capital murder, which was enacted in the Homicide Act 1957. =Emergency planning= Sea defences are breached at Erith during the 1953 flood. The Home Office had the responsibility of dealing with any civil emergency matter which might arise, and Newsam took personal charge as chairman of the official committee on emergencies. In 1953 the storm tide of the North Sea caused severe flooding along the East coast; Newsam controlled the direction of all the resources of the government in repairing sea defences and homes, including taking charge of very large numbers of troops who provided an emergency workforce. Rab Butler wrote that he \\"had almost literally taken charge of the country\\" and \\"secured achievements that would have surprised Canute\\".Lord Butler, \\"The art of the possible: the memoirs of Lord Butler, K. G., C.H.\\", Hamish Hamilton, 1971, p. 199. The main business of the emergencies committee was to cope with strikes, and here Newsam was cautious that the Government should not intervene incorrectly or excessively (particularly if asked to call out troops), because the likely effect would be to cause the strike to spread.Keir Thorpe, \\"'Rendering the Strike Innocuous': The British Government's Response to Industrial Disputes in Essential Industries, 1953‚Äì55\\", Journal of Contemporary History, vol. 35 no. 4 (October 2000), pp. 577‚Äì600, especially p. 579. Newsam was thought to have been at his best in an emergency when he had to be decisive and authoritative.Anthony Seldon, \\"Churchill's Indian Summer\\", Hodder and Stoughton, 1981, p. 123; Newsam's anonymous obituarist in The Times says the same. On 1 July 1955 he was appointed Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John. =Other issues= In 1954 Newsam was caught up in a diplomatic incident over Antoni Klimowicz, a 24-year-old Polish man who stowed away on the ship Jaros≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski and attempted to go ashore in London and claim asylum. Klimowicz was spotted by the crew and detained on the ship.\\"Poles Seek Freedom For Stowaway\\", The Times, 31 July 1954, p. 6. Newsam sent Home Office lawyers to obtain a writ of habeas corpus and then arranged for 120 police officers, led in person by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (Sir John Nott-Bower) to board the ship and rescue Klimowicz on 31 July.\\"Police Search Of Polish Vessel\\", The Times, 2 August 1954, p. 6. The Polish Embassy protested,\\"Protest By Poland\\", The Times, 5 August 1954, p. 6. but Klimowicz was allowed to stay.\\"Pole To Remain In Britain\\", The Times, 7 August 1954, p. 4. However Newsam's intervention in another matter was less successful: in late 1956 Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George accepted Newsam's advice and authorised the telephone tapping of Billy Hill, a known criminal. At the time gang warfare had broken out in London between Hill and rival gangster Jack Spot.The Times, Bench Of The Honourable Society Of Lincoln's Inn Charges Against Barrister In Re Marrinan, 28 June 1957 The Bar council approached the police and requested the tapes in order to provide evidence for an investigation into the professional conduct of Hill's barrister, Patrick Marrinan. When this use of tapping powers was revealed in June 1957 (by which time Rab Butler had succeeded Lloyd George), there was a major row with the Leader of the Opposition Hugh Gaitskell demanding a full explanation. Butler pledged that it would not be a precedent and that he would consider withdrawing the evidence and asking the Bar council to disregard it.\\"Mr. Butler's Promise On Telephone Tapping\\", The Times, 8 June 1957, p. 6. Marrinan was subsequently disbarred and expelled by Lincoln's Inn,\\"Mr. Marrinan Disbarred\\", The Times, 4 July 1957, p. 10. but Butler was forced to appoint a committee of Privy Counsellors under Sir Norman Birkett to look into the prerogative power of intercepting telephone communications.\\"'Tapping' Inquiry By Privy Councillors\\", The Times, 29 June 1957, p. 6. Retirement When Rab Butler arrived at the Home Office, he quickly decided that his own wish to take charge and reform the department was likely to bring him into conflict with Newsam. He quietly persuaded Newsam to retire.Anthony Howard, \\"RAB: the life of R.A. Butler\\", Jonathan Cape, 1987, p. 256. For his part Newsam was well beyond normal retirement age for a civil servant and accepted, fixing his last day in office as 30 September 1957.\\"Sir Frank Newsam To Retire\\", The Times, 1 June 1957, p. 6. A few days after his retirement was announced, Newsam was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours. In retirement, Newsam was commissioned by the British Medical Association to report into whether it was realistic for doctors to withdraw from the National Health Service should their pay demand be rejected.\\"Doctors' Claim For Higher Pay\\", The Times, 8 January 1959, p. 7. He found that the threat to withdraw was unrealistic, and that public opinion would not easily forgive a move on behalf of doctors to undermine the NHS. Newsam's conclusion was unwelcome to the BMA which officially dissociated itself from it.\\"Health Service Report Warns B.M.A.\\", The Times, 16 January 1959, p. 7. He also served on the police committee of the British Transport Commission. Newsam's health had begun to decline during his last years in office, and he died of cancer at his home in Paddington on 25 April 1964. His name lived on as the Police Staff College inaugurated the 'Frank Newsam Memorial Lectures' on criminal justice matters.\\"Lord Devlin On Time-Wasting Courts\\", The Times, 10 December 1965, p. 6. The series seems to come to an end. Character Newsam was described by Philip Allen, who served under him, as a \\"born leader\\" and a superb chairman of any meeting, with a strong personality which tended to drive his solutions forward. He was a good negotiator, but Allen and others agreed that Newsam could show impatience and intolerance if other people disagreed with him. While a very good professional administrator, his interest was not in organisation but in problem-solving. In speech he was said to be eloquent and able to produce surprising pieces of knowledge; and several comment on the fact that he had good looks which suggested foreign origins.Sir Austin Strutt writing in the Dictionary of National Biography described Newsam as \\"good looking in a rather Latin way\\", which A.W. Brian Simpson states to be a reference to \\"supposed partially African descent\\". By contrast Philip Allen says Newsam had \\"a touch of the Caribbean\\". Newsam enjoyed gambling on horse-racing and enjoyed high living; he was known to drink a great deal. Newsam's wife Janet, whom he married in December 1927, was from South Africa. She left London to live in Wylye, Wiltshire during World War II, and liked the countryside so much that she never returned to live in London. Newsam saw her most weekends but remained living in London after he retired; the couple remained very friendly but did not see much of each other, and they had no children.

She was the first Nepali woman Minister of Water Resources, and the first Nepali woman deputy prime minister. A member of the influential Koirala family, Acharya entered active politics as a student, and was held political prisoner for three years as a teenager, after she showed a black flag to King Mahendra in protest of coup d'√©tat by the monarchy against the democratically elected government in 1961. Upon release, she went into self-exile in India where she fostered a close friendship with Indian leaders, notably Chandra Sekhar, while she continued to advance the democratic struggle against the Panchayat System. She played an instrumental role in organising the youth movement, collecting and smuggling arms and ammunition for a possible armed conflict and publishing a paper to raise political awareness. She accompanied BP Koirala when the latter returned to Nepal and was immediately arrested upon arrival. She spent a total of five years in jail during the Panchayat regime. After the reinstitution of democracy, Acharya was elected twice to parliament, in 1991 and 1994. Between 1991 and 1993, she was the Minister for Agriculture, a post she resigned in protest of corruption in the government. In 1997, she became the first woman Minister for Water Resources, and in 1998, she became the first woman deputy prime minister. After King Gyanendra suspended democracy in another coup, she continued to support constitutional monarchy publicly, in defiance of her party's position. She was appointed ambassador to India in 2007. Acharya was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007. She died of pneumonia in Kathmandu on 12 June 2009. She is remembered for her principled positions, her defiance of tyranny at a young age, her role in the fight for democracy, and her philanthropic activities. She was awarded the honour of Maha Ujjwal Rashtradip by the government of Nepal in 2014. Personal life Acharya was born in 1944. Her mother, Indira Acharya, had participated in the democratic revolution of 1950, and was one of the first four Nepali women to be arrested by the Rana regime. Acharya had a sister, Madhu Bastola and a brother, Pradeep Acharya. Acharya is the niece of former Nepal prime ministers Matrika Prasad Koirala, BP Koirala and Girija Prasad Koirala. Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala is her niece. She was close friends with former India prime minister Chandra Sekhar. She had an Intermediate of Science (I.Sc.) degree. She did not marry. Career She was a senior leader in Nepali Congress, rising to the post of party vice-chair. Among the second generation of Nepali Congress leaders, she was considered one of the few ideological pathfinders. She was deeply involved with her constituency in Morang. =Panchayat regime= On 18 February 1961, she showed a black flag to King Mahendra in protest of the latter suspending democracy in Nepal and imprisoning the democratically elected prime minister BP Koirala who was also her uncle. She was jailed for three years for the offence. She spent a total of five years in prison during her struggle against the Panchayat system. She spent nine years in self-imposed exile to India. During her stay there, she was one of the most prominent leaders in organising and mobilising the democratic resistance from India. She, along with Bhim Bahadur Tamang and Chakra Prasad Bastola, was instrumental in re-organising Tarun Dal, the youth wing of the party, in 1973-74. The three oversaw the logistics of the Tarun Dal meeting at a school in Baburi village of Varanasi. She was also the Chief Editor of Tarun, which was published from Varanasi during the same period. She was instrumental in collecting arms and ammunition ‚Äî along with Nona Koirala, and Chakra Prasad Bastola, another veteran Nepali Congress leader who was also her brother-in-law ‚Äî in an effort to smuggle arms into Nepal to conduct an armed revolution. Some of the arms were later used in the 1973 Nepal plane hijacking. After the party abandoned the ides of armed struggle, the arms and ammunition were donated to the Bengali people who were fighting against the government of East Pakistan. She returned to Nepal in 1976 along with BP Koirala, but she and everyone else were immediately arrested upon landing at Tribhuvan International Airport, and taken directly to Sundarijal jail. =1990s= After the reinstatement of democracy in Nepal in 1990, she won two terms to parliament from her home district of Morang. She won her first term in May 1991, from Morang-5 constituency. In the Nepali Congress government formed by Girija Prasad Koirala in 1991, she was given an opportunity to choose her own ministerial portfolio. She chose the ministry of agriculture and forests which she led until 1993. In 1993, she resigned from the cabinet charging the government with nepotism and rampant \\"commission culture\\". Incidentally, as Girija Prasad Koirala's niece, she too was a beneficiary of Koirala's alleged nepotism. She won her second term in parliament in the 1994 election, again from Morang. In 1997, she became the minister of Water Resources, and for a brief period in 1998, she became the first Nepali woman Deputy Prime minister. She was also the first woman to become Minister of Water Resources. Since then, she was slowly sidelined in the party. =2000s= Acharya drew widespread criticism for her opposition to the seven- party alliance against the direct rule by the king. Her support for constitutional monarchy and opposition to the 2006 revolution effectively ended her prospects in active politics. In 2007, she was appointed Nepal's ambassador to India, succeeding Karna Dhoj Adhikari. She faced opposition from other parties in the coalition government due to her controversial stance against the revolution of 2006, but was eventually cleared for appointment by the parliamentary committee overseeing the ambassadorial appointments. Philanthropy Acharya was involved with several NGOs and other charity work, mainly in the field of women empowerment and welfare. She established the Krishna Prasad Koirala guthi in memory of her maternal grandfather, and donated financial and other support to the establishment of Shailaja Acharya Polytechnic Institute in a rural village in her constituency in Morang, which was named after her in recognition of her contributions to its founding. She had donated 1.5 bigha of land for the construction site of the institute, and later negotiated a partnership with CTEVT to provide accessible skills training to poor women and girls in the community. Illness and death In her final years, she was in poor health having been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and dropped out almost completely from public life. After a long battle with Alzheimer's disease and pneumonia, she died around 4:25 am on 12 June 2009, at the age of 65. She had previously sought treatment in Bangkok for nine months as well as in New Delhi, and two days before her death, had been admitted to TU Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu, where she was on ventilator support in the ICU. Her body was kept for public viewing at Nepali Congress Party Headquarters in Sanepa, where Girija Prasad Koirala draped her body with the party's flag. She was also given a gun-salute by an army- contingent. She was cremated at the Pashupati Aryaghat, later that same day. The parliament passed a resolution of condolences over her demise. Honours Acharya was awarded the Maha Ujjwal Rashtradip () by a cabinet decision on 28 May 2014, for her contributions. Legacy Acharya has been remembered as an inspiring figure and \\"a rebellious personality\\" by senior Nepali Congress leader Ram Chandra Paudel. Former minister Mohan Bahadur Basnet has characterised her as a lifelong devotee to democracy with a \\"clean image\\". The then prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, speaking at her funeral, called her an icon of democratic values and principles, further stating that her determined fight against \\"corruption, irregularities and wrongful attitudes even when she was in power\\" was exemplary. She was the first, and at the time of her death, only Nepali woman to become deputy prime minister. Her cousin, Sujata Koirala, became the second to woman deputy prime minister in October 2009. Her showing the black flag to King Mahendra in 1961 for which she spent three years in jail, is considered a landmark event in the history of Nepalese struggle for freedom and democracy. Despite her success, she is considered to have underachieved. Even labelled the \\"most famous nobody of Nepal\\", attempted explanations for her underachievement in Nepali politics have centred around her conservative stances, specially her support for constitutional monarchy at a time when the whole country was moving towards republicanism, and overshadowing by keen uncle Girija Prasad Koirala who did not relinquish his position in the party or the national politics to make way for the second generation of leaders among whom Acharya was in the top-tier for most of her political career. However, Acharya herself attributed it to sexism, claiming that she was not taken seriously because of her gender, and her contributions and sacrifices were undervalued or ignored. Nepal Press Union, Morang awards Shailaja Acharya Memorial Journalism Award in her honour. Shailaja Acharya Adarsha Samaj promotes Acharya's ideals. In her home constituency in Morang, Shailaja Acharya Memorial Scholarship Fund grants free scholarships to deserving school students.

He became the principal of Jamia Naeemia in 1998 after the death of his father. The school is located in Garhi Shahu neighbourhood of Lahore . He got his early education from Jamia Naeemia and then did PhD from the Punjab University besides a short course from Al- Azhar University, in Egypt.

The organization is tied to several universities in Pakistan and conducts its own exam according to its scheme and syllabus. He has four daughters and one son, Raghib Hussain Naeemi, who succeeded him as principal of Jamia Naeemia after his death. Views Naeemi was known for his outspoken views against suicide bombings and militancy, for openly supporting the ongoing operation by Pakistan army in Swat, and for labelling the activities of the Taliban \\"un-Islamic\\". In May 2009 he was quoted by Reuters as having said, \\"The military must eliminate the Taliban once and for all otherwise they will capture the entire country which would be a big catastrophe\\". Also in May 2009, he took part in a conference of Islamic scholars convened by the government which criticised suicide attacks and the beheading of innocent Muslims as un-Islamic. He advocated equal access to education for women and the use of computers in schools, ideas in contrast with Taliban's harsh interpretation of Islam. Naeemi had also organised demonstrations against the Taliban as well organising an alliance of religious organisations to oppose the Taliban. Last month the Sunni Ittehad Council announced that they \\"strongly condemn the Taliban and urge the Pakistan military to eliminate them at the earliest\\", the council also said it would \\"unveil the real face of the Taliban before the public\\" by exposing their brutality. He had also passed a fatwƒÅ denouncing suicide bombings, as well as criticising Taliban leader Sufi Muhammad by saying he \\"should wear bangles if he is hiding like a woman\\". Naeemi had said \\"Those who commit suicide attacks for attaining paradise will go to hell, as they kill many innocent people\\". According to Khalid Zaheer, a Pakistani professor and religious scholar \\"His argument was simple: Religion does not stand for violence. You can't take the life of any individual, or your own life. And you can't wage jihad against your own state.\\" Naeemi was the driving force behind the Tahaffuz-e-Namoos-e- Risalat Mahaz (TNRM), a group of over 20 Sunni parties raising voice against the violence committed by the Taliban. In January 2009 Tahaffuz-e-Namoos-e- Risalat Mahaz (TNRM) held a conference in Jamia Naeemia and issued a fatwa making Jihad obligatory for all Pakistani citizens in case of an attack by India.

First broadcast in 1973 during Tony Blackburn's mid-morning show, the segment was continued for many years on Radio 1 by Simon Bates, Simon Mayo, and Chris Moyles.  History  In June 1973, Noel Edmonds took over presenting the breakfast slot on BBC Radio 1 and Tony Blackburn moved to present the mid-morning slot (9‚Äì12 am). One of the features he started on this show was the Golden Hour. This was originally an hour of records that had all charted in a specified year, with Tony using a different year each weekday. Blackburn continued this feature until he vacated the weekday mid-morning slot in Autumn 1977 with a move to weekday afternoons. He was replaced by Simon Bates, who continued the feature at the top of the show between 9 and 10 am. Bates amended the format, however, turning it into a game for the audience to participate in. Records were played, sometimes interspersed with clues, so listeners could 'play along at home' and work out what the year was. The year would be revealed by Simon near the end of the hour. Later on, Simon split this into two half-hour segments, playing songs from two different years. Towards the end of 1993, when new controller Matthew Bannister took over and reorganised the station's shows and presenters, Simon Mayo moved from breakfast to mid-morning, taking over the feature from Bates. The Golden Hour, or 'Mystery Years', as they were now sometimes referred to, lasted until 1996 when they were replaced with an hour of music from a number of years including the current one. Between May 1994 and April 1995, Sunday lunchtimes also featured the Classic Years (12‚Äì2 pm), also presented by Mayo. There was also a feature which ran between 1996 and 1999 on Fridays called \\"Golden Hour Jukebox\\", then \\"The Jukebox\\", then \\"Greatest Hits Jukebox,\\" where listeners could ring in and suggest tracks instead of the normal format. The 9‚Äì10 weekday slot was eventually named \\"Radio 1's Greatest Hits\\", becoming the somewhat unwieldy \\"Radio 1's Greatest Hits: The Mystery Years\\" in 1999. Listeners were challenged to answer a question on a piece of archive footage from the relevant year. Mayo continued \\"The Mystery Years\\" until he left the station on 16 February 2001. Reinvention On 30 September 2007, to commemorate the station's 40th anniversary, former breakfast show host Chris Moyles co-hosted the show with Tony Blackburn and between 9 and 10 am they brought back the Golden Hour in the form of two half-hour years. At the start of 2008, The Chris Moyles Show gained the Golden Hour as a permanent feature, although only once a week rather than every day as in previous years. Moyles played this every Friday, starting at 9 am with half an hour of songs from a year and getting the listeners (as well as friends of the show) to text in their guess before revealing it ahead of the 9:30 news. From 9:30 to 10 am Moyles played songs selected by each member of his team. Moyles used retro jingles from the initial Golden Hour in his Friday slot. This ceased when Moyles left the station in September 2012. Since 21 September 2015, Moyles presents a new feature, The Platinum Hour, on his Radio X's breakfast show between 9 am and 10 am on Friday mornings and a shorter version between 10:40 and 11:00 on his Saturday show. Other broadcasters on UK commercial radio have run features similar to the Golden Hour around the same time of day; an example is The Time Tunnel on the Heart network. Tony Blackburn's show on BBC Radio 2, Tony Blackburn's Golden Hour, first aired on 6 January 2017 and features music from the 1950s to the present day, without the game element. Smooth Radio Simon Bates revived the Golden Hour for commercial radio after joining Smooth Radio in January 2011. The feature appeared as before, on weekdays between 9 and 10 am on Bates' breakfast show, and saw listeners invited to guess the year that a number of songs charted. There were usually two featured years per day, but this changed to one from October 2013. On Friday 21 March 2014, Bates presented his final show for Smooth, and announced that he was featuring the last ever Golden Hour on his programme. BBC Radio Devon Simon Bates joined BBC Radio Devon on 12 January 2015, where he relaunched The Golden Hour with new jingles, with the years ranging from 1956 to 2004. Bates usually asked listeners to send him emails and texts with the year they thought it might be, and he read them in between the music. Over Christmas 2015, Simon did two pop- up Golden Hours on the station. The featured ended when Simon left the station in 2017.

Two Banks to the Jordan) is a poem written by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the Revisionist Zionist leader, a song that became one of the most known leading songs of the Revisionist Zionist youth movement, Betar. The song includes four Stanzas. Each stanza ends with the following line which is the main political message and theme of the poem: Jabotinsky wrote the song in 1929 while visiting Paris. The first version of the song was handed to the Zionist Students' union \\"Yardeniya\\" in Kaunas, on 18 November 1929. In a later version, which is the one known today, the song was published in one of the Yishuv's daily newspapers, \\"Doar Hayom\\", on 11 April 1930. The song was written seven years after the decision by the British Government to divide the territory of the British Mandate, in which there was to be established a national home for the Jewish people, into two territories, and to establish on one of its sides, on the east of the Jordan river, the Jordanian Kingdom. Prior to that decision, Chaim Weizmann had raised historical and practical arguments in favor of keeping Greater Israel, on both sides of the river. However, the World Zionist Organization accepted the borders that were outlined by the British government, and the removal of the territory east of the Jordan River from the British Mandate's boundaries, and preferred to focus on developing the Land of Israel west of the Jordan. The Revisionist Zionist movement and its founder, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, and also some in the liberal \\"Ahdut Ha'voda\\", continued to perceive the land east of the Jordan River as suitable for Jewish building, and a territory that should be included within the future Jewish state. The Irgun's emblem included an image of most parts of the Land of Israel in the original borders of the British Mandate. The song The East of the Jordan reflects the idea of the Jewish state existing on both sides of the Jordan River. In the first stanza of the song, Jabotinsky compares the Jordan River to a spinal cord. The second stanza also emphasizes that the Jordan River is located in the midst of the Land of Israel. The third stanza includes an additional ideological message, in which everyone in Greater Israel will live in peace and dignity: The fourth and last stanza ends up with a religious oath that is a paraphrase of the biblical verse of Psalms: 137:5 ‚Äì \\"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning\\": This part of the land of Israel is referred to in the song as \\"The East of the river\\". Just as one may view this part of Israel while sailing along the river's stream, one can travel along the Left Bank of the Seine river in France, where Jabotinsky was writing the song. The Musical composition was originally written in Kaunas by Tzvi Girsh Livshin, a close friend of Zeev Jabotinsky. Another version was later composed by Mordechai Zeira, in 1932. The main theme of the song also influenced other Zionists' poems, and its main theme appears also in Raise Up the Barricades, by Michael Eshbal, also one of the Betar youth movement's well known poems, which says of the Jewish state: \\"To establish the state on both sides of the Jordan\\".Raise Up the Barricades, www.saveisrael.com See also *Greater Israel *Betar *Iron Wall (essay) References External links * *◊©◊û◊ê◊ú ◊î◊ô◊®◊ì◊ü Lyrics in Hebrew, Betar's Israeli website Category:Ze'ev Jabotinsky Category:Hebrew- language songs Category:Jordan River basin Category:Zionism Category:1929 poems Category:1929 songs ","title":"The East Bank of the Jordan"},{"id":"23198300","text":"Lunatic is the fifth book in the Lost Books series, written by Ted Dekker, and the first book in the series written with Kaci Hill.

Apart from the true monogenic genetic disorders, environmental diseases may determine the development of disease in those genetically predisposed to a particular condition. Stress, physical and mental abuse, diet, exposure to toxins, pathogens, radiation, and chemicals found in almost all personal care products and household cleaners are possible causes of a large segment of non-hereditary disease. If a disease process is concluded to be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factor influences, its etiological origin can be referred to as having a multifactorial pattern. There are many different types of environmental disease including: * Lifestyle disease such as cardiovascular disease, diseases caused by substance abuse such as alcoholism, and smoking-related disease * Disease caused by physical factors in the environment, such as skin cancer caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation in sunlight * Disease caused by exposure to toxic or irritant chemicals in the environment such as toxic metals Environmental Diseases vs. Pollution-Related Diseases Environmental diseases are a direct result from the environment. Meanwhile, pollution-related diseases are attributed to exposure to toxins in the air, water, and soil. Therefore all pollution-related disease are environmental diseases, but not all environmental diseases are pollution-related diseases. Chemicals =Metals= Poisoning by lead and mercury has been known since antiquity. Other toxic metals or metals that are known to evoke adverse immune reactions are arsenic, phosphorus, zinc, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, manganese, nickel, cobalt, osmium, platinum, selenium, tellurium, thallium, uranium, and vanadium. =Halogens= There are many other diseases likely to have been caused by common anions found in natural drinking water. Fluoride is one of the most common found in drier climates where the geology favors release of fluoride ions to soil as the rocks decompose. In Sri Lanka, 90% of the country is underlain by crystalline metamorphic rocks of which most carry mica as a major mineral. Mica carries fluoride in their structure and releases to soil when decomposes. In the dry and arid climates, fluoride concentrates on top soil and slowly dissolves in shallow groundwater. This has been the cause of high fluoride levels in drinking water where the majority of the rural Sri Lankans obtain their drinking water from backyard wells. High fluoride in drinking water has caused a high incidence of fluorosis among dry zone population in Sri Lanka. However, in the wet zone, high rainfall effectively removes fluoride from soils where no fluorosis is evident. In some parts of Sri Lanka iodine deficiency has also been noted which has been identified as a result of iodine fixation by hydrated iron oxide found in lateritic soils in wet coastal lowlands. =Organic compounds= Additionally, there are environmental diseases caused by the aromatic carbon compounds including : benzene, hexachlorocyclohexane, toluene diisocyanate, phenol, pentachlorophenol, quinone and hydroquinone. Also included are the aromatic nitro-, amino-, and pyridilium-deratives: nitrobenzene, dinitrobenzene, trinitrotoluene, paramethylaminophenol sulfate (Metol), dinitro-ortho-cresol, aniline, trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (tetryl), hexanitrodiphenylamine (aurantia), phenylenediamines, and paraquat. The aliphatic carbon compounds can also cause environmental disease. Included in these are methanol, nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose, dimethylnitrosamine, and the halogenated hydrocarbons: methyl chloride, methyl bromide, trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, and the chlorinated naphthalenes. Also included are glycols: ethylene chlorhydrin and diethylene dioxide as well as carbon disulfide, acrylonitrile, acrylamide, and vinyl chloride. =Noxious gases= Noxious gases can be categorized as : Simple asphyxiants, chemical asphyxiants, and irritant gases. The simple asphixiants are nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. The chemical asphyxiants are carbon monoxide, sulfuretted hydrogen and hydrogen cyanide. The irritant gases are sulfur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, chlorine, phosgene, and fluorine and its compounds, which include luroine and hydrofluoric acid, fluorspar, fluorapatite, cryolite, and organic fluorine compounds. Categorization and surveillance The U.S. Coast Guard has developed a Coast Guard-wide comprehensive system for surveillance of workplace diseases. The American Medical Association's fifth edition of the Current Medical Information and Terminology (CMIT) was used as a reference to expand the basic list of 50 Sentinel Health Events (Occupational) [SHE(O)] published by the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH), September, 1983.

Education He completed graduate work in English at State University of New York at Binghamton, where he worked under David Sloan Wilson. Recognition Gottschall was profiled by The New York Times and The Chronicle of Higher Education. His work was featured in an article in Science describing literature and evolution. Selected works His work The Rape of Troy: Evolution, Violence and the World of Homer describes the Homeric epic poems Iliad and Odyssey in terms of evolutionary psychology, with the central violent conflicts in these works driven by the lack of young women to marry and the resulting evolutionary legacy, as opposed to the violent conflicts being driven by honor or wealth. Literature, Science and a New Humanities advocates that the humanities, and literary studies in particular, need to avail themselves of quantitative and objective methods of inquiry as well as the traditional qualitative and subjective, if they are to produce cumulative, progressive knowledge, and provides a number of case studies that apply quantitative methods to fairy and folk tale around the world to answer questions about human universals and differences. Gottschall's book, The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human (Houghton Mifflin 2012), is about the evolutionary mystery of storytelling‚Äîabout the way we shape stories, and stories shape us. A review by The Virginian-Pilot said \\"Gottschall assesses and accounts for that powerful narrative attraction in a compelling chronicle of his own...and it is a certifiable knee-slap, three-pipe, blue- moon ripsnorter. The Storytelling Animal was a New York Times Editor's Choice selection and a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. In his latest book, The Professor in the Cage: Why Men Fight and Why We Like to Watch (Penguin 2015), Gottschall describes the three years he spent at a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) gym trying to learn how to fight.

Bessouet's work focused primarily around portraits, domesticity and the female nude. Her paintings were abstract in their style and she also created equally as abstract wooden dolls. Early life and education Norma Bessouet was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her mother, Luisa Enero, was an illustrator and painter, who inspired Bessouet's interest as an artist. Her father, Ivan Bessouet, was a cabinetmaker. He and Enero supported Bessouet's interest in the visual arts. In 1964, she was accepted into the Academia de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredon, which she graduated from in 1968. Bessouet studied under Ideal S√°nchez. Bessouet was highly influenced by the work of A√≠da Carballo and often claimed Carballo as her one and only influence. Carballo worked at the Academia de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredon, too. In 1974 she emigrated from Argentina to Europe. Work in Argentina Art historian Marta Garsd has cited Carballo as being the primary influence on Bessouet's painting, including the introduction of the works of the Sienese School. The Sienese School influenced the \\"delicate line and color, and jewel-like surfaces,\\" that were noted in Bessouet's work, alongside the female nude. She has found additional inspiration in the work of Marcel Schwob, with a specific interest in the emotional components of Schwob's work versus the artistic merits. Garsd describes Bessouet's work as being on the verge of abstraction and figurative art and on the verge of modernism along the style of Lino Eneas Spilimbergo. In 1971, Bessouet was awarded the grand prize for a female new drawing from the Argentine Academy of Arts. Despite some success in Argentine competitions, Bessouet struggled to find commercial success and appreciation in the gallery scene of Buenos Aires. She was rejected from major galleries because she was a woman artist. She did not identify collectively with feminism and the female struggle, and chose to attack the patriarchy of the fine art world independently rather than with other women artists, like the Union de Feministas Argentina. Relocation to Europe In 1974, Bessouet relocated to London, England. She was awarded a fellowship from the Slade School of Fine Arts in London and also spent some time working in Italy and, in 1976, in Barcelona, Spain. In Spain she attempted to gain attention for her woodworking. Her mother sent her cabinetmaking tools used by her father. With those tools, she made dolls, which had faces that \\"recalled the famous 19th-century prototypes created in Paris by Pierre Francois Jumeau,\\" according to historian Marta Garsd. The dolls had glass eyes, clothing made of lace, and additional antique elements. The dolls are very abstract and have \\"organic elements\\" which are represented in enlarged heads, oddly shaped eyes, and exposed genitalia. She became a fellow, in 1981, at the Ministry of Culture in Spain. This fellowship had her traveling to New York City, where she would eventually relocate full-time. Life in New York As of 1981, Bessouet lived in New York City as a full- time artist. She continued to explore her work with dolls. The dolls she created in New York were dramatically different than those in Spain. The dolls were \\"androgynous, \\"angelical,\\" winged and made of transparent materials.\\" The dolls have been described as \\"emblems of feminism\\" and \\"sexless creatures,\\" by Garsd. While in New York, she focused primarily on painting, with her androgynous dolls making appearances in her work, often as erotic figures in mystical environments. Bessouet worked in both New York and Buenos Aires and did not use professional models in her work, preferring to work with people she knew personally.

After finishing high school and working for several years, she earned a nursing degree from the Toronto General Hospital in 1913, and a bachelor's degree in administration and teaching from Teachers College, Columbia University in New York City in 1915. In 1922, as a nursing teacher at St. Luke's Hospital Training School for Nurses in New York, Harmer published the first edition of her textbook. She joined the faculty of the Yale School of Nursing in 1923, and remained there until 1927; at Yale, she was also First Assistant Superintendent of Nurses at the New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. During this time she also published a second book, Methods and Principles of Teaching the Practice of Nursing. She left her position at Yale in 1927 for health reasons, but returned to Teachers College where she earned a master's degree.

It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home of PAS Giannina. The rock band Scorpions held the concert in the Zosimades Stadium in 2010. History In 1934, at the suggestion of the surgeon-doctor Periklis Yannis and the tireless and pious efforts of the then Metropolitan of Ioannina and later Archbishop of Athens and all Greece Spyridon (Vlachos), the sports facilities were moved to the place where the National Stage of Zosimades \\"Of course, it might have been used before, about the end of 1932 to the beginning of 1933. In that area, there was an extensive area known as the \\"Hoja Field\\", which apparently once belonged to a Hoxha, but which was small to meet the needs of a permanent stadium in the city. Then Metropolitan Spyridon himself visited the area surrounded by poor little houses that had small gardens and little fields. With fiery patriotic words he persuaded the inhabitants of this land, to give up some of their properties to create the foreseen land and eventually to build a decent stage where the youth would train. So the first decent stage was created in the city. The space is bought in part over a period of 20 years. Its original form is completely different. The changing rooms were in the courtyards next to the houses, namely in the courtyard of Mrs. Kostena. The foundation stone of the new stadium was set on October 18, 1936. The ceremony was attended by the government, local and ecclesiastical authorities. Also at the ceremony were students from the schools and schools of the city but also a crowd of people. His first administration, on 4 September 1945, gave him the name Zosimades, in honor of the Zosimades brothers. In the beginning the Metropolis provided enough money to fencing the new stadium by building a huge stone wall around it. A little later, around 1959 to 1960, the Metropolis built, on the north side of the stadium, a capacity of about five hundred spectators, with the ultimate goal of securing ownership of the stadium, as there was nothing to prove its ownership. This regime lasted until the Duchy of the Colonels, so on a visit by the then Secretary-General of Sports Konstantinos Aslanidis who, seeing this enormous space in the middle of the city, was positively impressed and asked for a study to be made as soon as possible built a decent stage worthy of the historic city of Ioannina. As a matter of course, it was a matter of ownership of the stadium, because it was not possible to disburse money from the General Secretariat of Sports and the owner was the Metropolis. Eventually it was bought by the state and so it finally ended the issue. In 1965, a preliminary study of electrification of the stadium by Siemens was made. In 1966 the athletics track would be entered while the study also provided a swimming pool. In 1993 strong winds destroyed the then sheltered platform, opposite the large enclosure. In 2000 the headlamps were placed and the seats were replaced. The stadium has 8 headlights (2 in each corner) until the four headlamps have been transported to Rizoupoli. In the summer of 2007 the turf was changed. In 2009, the old roof was rebuilt, 16 years after the disaster. In July and August 2010, the turf was changed again, as well as some piping work. The slope of the stadium fell more (from 71 cm to 41), which is in line with the UEFA standards. In September of the same year, tourniques were placed at the entrances. In the summer of 2016 the stadium hosted a match in the second qualifying round of the Europa League 2016-17 after some works that were made (mainly the growth of the field). In its present form, however, it can not host competitions from the third qualifying round then. In the summer of 2017, drainage works and turf change were made once again within a few years.

He is a Curators‚Äô Distinguished Professor at the University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis, where he has taught since 1985. Carroll's Evolution and Literary Theory (1995) was one of the first works of literary theory to assimilate ideas from evolutionary psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and sociobiology. He integrated those ideas with ideas from traditional humanism and presented the synthesis as an alternative to poststructuralism. He rejected poststructuralism's textualism (the notion that words make the world) and its indeterminancy (the notion that words are self-subverting). In the essays collected in Literary Darwinism: Evolution, Human Nature and Literature, Carroll explored the emerging field of literary Darwinism, worked toward building a comprehensive model of human nature, critiqued poststructuralism, traditional humanism, ecocriticism, cognitive rhetoric, and narrow-school evolutionary psychology, and offered examples of practical Darwinist criticism. In the essays collected in Reading Human Nature, Carroll examined the adaptive function of literature and the other arts, offered Darwinist interpretations of The Picture of Dorian Gray, Wuthering Heights, and Hamlet, gave examples of quantitative literary analysis, and reflected on the course of intellectual history from Darwin to the present. In the research described in Graphing Jane Austen, Carroll and colleagues conducted an Internet survey of reader responses to characters in British novels of the nineteenth century. The survey used categories from a model of human nature that included basic motives, emotions, personality characteristics, and criteria for selecting mates. The focus of the study was \\"agonistic structure,\\" that is, the organization of characters into protagonists, antagonists, and minor characters.

He was the head coach at Indiana State University from 1997 to 2007; at the University of Indianapolis from 1992 to 1997 and the 2007‚Äì08 season and at DePauw University from 1988 to 1992. He won 100 or more games at each school and led all three to the NCAA National Tournament; in addition, he led them all to conference regular and tournament championships. His career collegiate record was: 337‚Äì263 (.562). He was the color commentator for Indiana basketball broadcasts on radio. Waltman died at the age of 72 in 2014 after a period of declining health.http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/longtime- indiana-basketball-coach-royce-waltman-dies-at-72/25382086 His influence and legacy is represented by the Waltman Coaching Tree consisting of Indiana State coach Greg Lansing, Clemson coach Brad Brownell, who played for him at DePauw; Southeast Missouri & former Mississippi State coach Rick Ray, who coached with Waltman at Indiana State; former UM-Kansas City coach Kareem Richardson, UIndy coach Stan Gouard and current University of Chicago coach Mike McGrath. His former assistant Todd Sturgeon succeeded him at UIndy, spending 10 years leading the Greyhounds. Long-time assistant Dick Bender is on Brownell's Clemson staff. Coaching career =Indiana State= It took just three seasons for Royce Waltman to return the Sycamores to the spotlight, attracting national attention unlike that since the fabled 1978‚Äì79 team danced to the NCAA Championship game. He was named as the 1999‚Äì2000 Missouri Valley Conference Coach of The Year. As if an encore was needed, Waltman, in his fourth season at Indiana State, he directed the 2000‚Äì01 Sycamores to their first MVC Tournament Championship since the 1978‚Äì79 campaign - leading Indiana State to consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances. While Waltman will quickly deflect praise for what the 1999‚Äì2000 Sycamores accomplished as being due to the diligent efforts of his entire staff, the achievements which he and his program have attained certainly merit mention of the bold face, large type variety. Be it a mid-December, 63‚Äì60, victory at Indiana to claim the Indiana Classic Championship or defeating the Hoosiers again ‚Äì this time in Terre Haute, recording the University's first 20-win season in 21 years, claiming outright possession of Indiana State's first MVC regular-season title over that same 21-year span or directing the Sycamores to consecutive NCAA Div I Tournament appearances for the first time in the school's history, Waltman's dedication, or to use one of his favorite terms ‚Äì passion ‚Äì for his program and the game of basketball are nothing short of amazing. During his ten seasons on the Sycamores‚Äô sidelines, Waltman has produced 14 All-MVC performers. In addition, 21 student-athletes have garnered MVC All-Academic plaudits. Waltman's determination to produce a winning program became apparent in his initial two seasons as the Sycamores captured their first back-to-back winning seasons in 20 years. Entering year number three, his Sycamores were picked to make a run for the 1999‚Äì2000 Missouri Valley Conference Championship. And run they did, taking the outright MVC regular season title. Winning games and quickly reversing the fortunes of struggling basketball programs is the hallmark of this veteran coach. Prior to his arrival at Indiana State, Waltman spent the past decade resurrecting basketball programs at the University of Indianapolis and DePauw University. =Indianapolis= In his initial season at the helm of the Greyhounds, Waltman's squad posted the first winning season since the 1988 campaign, the most wins since 1972 and the most conference wins in school history. That season also saw Waltman lead Indianapolis to then-school records of eight GLVC victories and the championship of the Peach Basket Classic. The following season his Greyhounds were nationally ranked for the first time in Division II, and he recorded back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in 23 years. In 1995‚Äì96 Waltman's squad received the school's first-ever NCAA Division II Tournament bid after finishing 20‚Äì8 in the regular season. Indianapolis recorded a school-record 14 wins in the Great Lakes Valley Conference, and Waltman was selected as the GLVC Coach-of-the-Year. His team posted the school's first postseason win in 32 years in the first round of the NCAA Division II tournament. The Greyhounds were ranked 14th nationally at one point in the season. In 1996‚Äì97, Waltman elevated his program to one of the premier basketball teams at the NCAA Division II level. The Greyhounds earned an in- season number-one ranking, eventually finishing as the No. 3 ranked team in the nation. Indianapolis captured the GLVC title with a school-record 23‚Äì5 record. For the second year, Waltman was selected by his peers as the GLVC Coach-of-the-Year, winning 16 games in conference and posting the school record winning streak (18). Waltman's 1996‚Äì97 Greyhounds also established school records for best NCAA Division II season record (23‚Äì5) and best NCAA Division II season winning percentage (.821). Waltman's .645 winning percentage at Indianapolis ranks him as the second-winningest coach in the school's history. =DePauw= Prior to his stint at Indianapolis, Waltman was the head coach at DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. During his tenure at that Division III institution, he compiled a record of 100‚Äì36. His 1989‚Äì90 squad captured the Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference championship and was national runners-up. His teams were ranked number-one in the nation during both the 1988‚Äì89 and 1990‚Äì91 seasons. He earned Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference (ICAC) Coach of the Year honors in 1990 after leading the Tigers to the league championship. The 1991‚Äì92 team finished 20‚Äì7, making the school's third straight trip to the NCAA playoffs under his guidance. He led the Tigers to their first-ever NCAA Division III number-one ranking in January 1988, and his winning percentage of .730 is second in the school's history. The 1989‚Äì90 team was inducted into the DePauw Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003.http://www.depauw.edu/ath/hallfame/bios/1990mbball.asp High school Prior to becoming a collegiate coach, Waltman spent 15 years as head coach at Bedford High School in Bedford, Pennsylvania. During that tenure, he amassed an overall record of 276‚Äì110 and captured 11 league titles and seven district championships. Coach Waltman returned to the high school ranks as an assistant coach; during the 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10 seasons, he was on staff at Indianapolis Roncalli High School.http://www.indystar.com/article/20100220/SPORTS0203/2200344/1004/SPORTS/Former- Indiana-State-coach-Royce-Waltman-enjoys-role-as-Roncalli-assistant The Rebels were 31‚Äì13 during his stint, with one sectional title.http://indianahsbasketball.homestead.com/files/boyslogs167.htm Head coaching record References Category:1942 births Category:2014 deaths Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:American sports radio personalities Category:Basketball players from Maryland Category:Basketball coaches from Maryland Category:DePauw Tigers men's basketball coaches Category:High school basketball coaches in the United States Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball coaches Category:Indianapolis Greyhounds men's basketball coaches Category:Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball coaches Category:People from Allegany County, Maryland Category:Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball players Category:Slippery Rock men's basketball players ","title":"Royce Waltman"},{"id":"23198710","text":"Bifrenaria vitellina is a species of orchid. vitellina ","title":"Bifrenaria vitellina"},{"id":"23198711","text":"Emran bin Bahar (born 9 August 1961) is a Bruneian diplomat and is currently the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Negara Brunei Darussalam to the Russian Federation.

They were part of the new wave of British heavy metal at the beginning of the 1980s. The band reformed in 2015. Career =Lineup= Initially the band consisted of brothers Mark Sutcliffe (voice and guitar) and Paul Sutcliffe (drums), Dave Crawte (guitar), and Richard Penny (bass). Later they replaced Richard Penny with Cris Linscott and added vocalist Steve \\"Sleeve\\" Mills, all under 21 at the time. They all had day jobs, as the band never became financially viable: \\"Sleeve\\" was employed by the Social Security Dapartment, Mark and Paul worked at a factory, Dave worked at a record shop, and Cris was an income tax collector. The band's manager was Steve Kendall.Chris Collingwood, Sounds, 1980-08-03 Mark Sutcliffe cites as a musical influence Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple fame, Cris Linscott admired Lynyrd Skynyrd and Rush, while \\"Sleeve\\" liked David Coverdale and Paul Rodgers. =Trial Records= The band came to sign with Trial Records and their first single, \\"One of These Days\\", had a pressing of only 2000 copies, which were sold out in a short time. After that they enlisted vocalist Rob Eckland to record their \\"Jealousy\\" / \\"Live It Up\\" single, which was a double A-side. The final release for the label was the Bright Lights EP which also had a pressing of 2000 copies. The A-side ran at 45 RPM but the B-side ran at 33‚Öì RPM. =The Enid and Lodge Studios= In 1982, the band were represented for a brief period by Lester Mortimer, the manager for British pomp rock band The Enid. Lead vocalist Adrian Grimes (AKA Adrian Lynden) joined them for the recording of a six-track demo, produced by Steven Stewart at The Enid's The Lodge Recording Studio. Some of these tracks were included on One Of These Days: The Anthology. The band played a few gigs with this line-up (the biggest being the Quay Theatre in Sudbury, Suffolk), but disbanded after a family tragedy. =Other releases= The band recorded a session for Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show, which secured them an inclusion in Metal Explosion, a BBC compilation record. They also managed to have two of their songs included in the second volume of the Metal For Muthas compilation series. In 1990, Lars Ulrich, the drummer and co-founder of the band Metallica, released a compilation entitled NWOBHM '79 Revisited celebrating the tenth anniversary of the new wave of British heavy metal. The double-CD includes some of the top acts of the time, with Trespass being represented with their biggest hit \\"One of These Days\\" from the BBC session. =Hiatus= After Trespass's break-up, the long-term members of the band (Mark, Paul, and Dave) formed a glam metal band Blue Blud (later Blue Blood), releasing two albums: The Big Noise (1989) and Universal Language (1991). After Blue Blood's break-up in 1992, the brothers revived the Trespass name and released an album of original material in 1993, Head. Various compilations of released and unreleased material have been issued during the years, both officially by the band and in unofficial bootlegs. Some of these include: Through the Ages, The Works, The Works 2, and One Of These Days: The Trespass Anthology. =Reformation= Trespass started to reform in 2013 into 2014 when they entered the studio once more to re-record their classic material, so it had a consistent sound and feel. The band launched an official Trespass Facebook page in December 2013. In 2014, Paul Sutcliffe decided he wanted to pursue other musical avenues so the remaining members of the band, Mark Sutcliffe and Dave Crawte, recruited James Last on drums, Paul Martin on guitars and Dan Biggin (AKA Danny B, who engineered the new album) on bass. The band's new line-up debuted at the Brofest #3 festival in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, on 28 February 2015. The new eponymously titled album and accompanying website were launched in March 2015. Crawte and Martin left the band in January 2016. A new drummer Jason Roberts and lead guitarist Joe Fawcett joined Mark Sutcliffe and Danny B, signalling a return to the original Trespass twin lead guitar sound. An album of new material, entitled Footprints in the Rock was released in late 2016. Nigel Booth joined the band as bassist in 2018.

Its altitudinal range is from . Ecology Acampe rigida is a deceptive orchid in that it produces a fragrance that may attract insects but does not then offer them any reward. It is self-compatible, but has not evolved any particular mechanism to enable self-pollination. In Guangxi province in southwestern China, it flowers in late August and September, at a time of year when rain falls almost daily and insect pollinators are scarce. In a research study, after many hours of observation, a single insect was observed to visit a flower, but pollination did not occur. Instead, the plant exhibited ombrophily; rain drops falling on the tips of the stamens knocked the caps off the anthers, and further drops caused the pollinia to be ejected upwards, after which strap-like stipes arrested their movement and caused them to land in the stigma cavity, resulting in self- pollination. A high rate of fruit set occurred, but without the action of the raindrops, self-pollination did not occur and fruit did not set.

He is notable as one of the first to introduce Japanese animated cartoons to North America. Biography Ladd, a Toledo, Ohio native, graduated from Scott High School in 1945 and from Ohio State University in 1949 with degrees in radio and speech. As a child, he did impersonations of movie stars including Betty Boop. When Ladd was in high school, he liked a radio program for children called Let's Pretend, which dramatized children's stories, which would serve an inspiration for him producing anime. Upon moving to the New York City area, Ladd got a year-long job at an FM radio station and then was employed at Cayton, Inc., an advertising agency that dabbled in film production. The agency acquired several nature documentaries, and Ladd was given the job of repackaging them into a feature film. Rather than an outright sale, the film was offered in trade to European distributors (cash exports being limited in post-war Europe), in exchange for marketable local film productions. The deal resulted in the acquisition of animated cartoons, and Ladd was given the job of repackaging and dubbing the films for the American market. Ladd became the house specialist in the \\"Westernizing\\" of overseas animated programming. A 1937 German short film on the future of space travel Weltraumschiff 1 startet was acquired, and the special effects sequences were excised by Ladd. His re- edited footage was augmented by new animated sequences and became part of a series entitled The Space Explorers which was syndicated to local TV stations from the late 1950s through the early 1960s. Ladd co-operated with William Cayton in producing a film and television serial version of the Czech film Journey to the Beginning of Time. Producer Norm Prescott employed Ladd to help reformat a 1965 Belgian animated feature Pinocchio dans l'espace, which was released theatrically by Universal in late 1965 as Pinocchio in Outer Space. Prescott later brought Ladd in as co-writer and co-producer on his home-grown 1972 Filmation feature Journey Back to Oz. But it was an earlier involvement with NBC-TV that helped open a new and enduring market to North America. In 1963, the network's distribution division, NBC Enterprises, had acquired the North American distribution rights to a Japanese animated series entitled Tetsuwan Atomu, and consulted with Ladd on how to market it. Ladd took the footage and created a pilot episode, eventually leading to the long-running series Astro Boy‚Äîthe inaugural appearance of anime on Western shores. One incident happened where a samurai in the series was considered as violent. When Ladd flew to Mushi Productions in 1964 and explained the violent nature, they didn't understand, and they compared it to police brutality in the US. They wanted him to explain it, and Ladd just simply said it's because of cultural differences. Animation like a robber holding a rifle to a poor mans head begging for money and a bachelor seeing pictures of nude women were cut by Ladd by being over the top violence, and he explained to Tezuka about the nude women \\"Sorry, Mr. Tezuka, we couldn't save that, if I ended up with all those shots, we wound up with a 2 minute program.\\" Ladd continued his involvement in early anime imports with Gigantor for Trans-Lux and Kimba the White Lion for NBC Enterprises. Later, Ladd was creative consultant for the 90's English dub of Sailor Moon for DiC Entertainment. Ladd was also responsible for having various black-and-white cartoons for his company called Color Systems Inc. such as Looney Tunes, Betty Boop Popeye, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and others to be redrawn colorized in South Korea from 1968 to 1974.CARTOON RESEARCH FAQ 2 Further reading Fred Ladd with Harvey Deneroff, Astro Boy and Anime Come to the Americas: An Insider's View of the Birth of a Pop Culture Phenomenon (McFarland, Jefferson NC, 2008) Notes External links * *May 2004 interview with Fred Ladd at ToledoBlade.com *1996 interview with Fred Ladd at Animation World Network * *GIGANTOR Website by Fred Ladd *The Space Explorers, animated short film, Fred Ladd (1957) Category:1927 births Category:Film producers from California Category:American television directors Category:Television producers from California Category:American television writers Category:American male screenwriters Category:American male television writers Category:Voice directors Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:Living people Category:Writers from Toledo, Ohio Category:Writers from New York City Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:Screenwriters from New York (state) Category:Screenwriters from California Category:Screenwriters from Ohio Category:Television producers from New York City Category:Film producers from New York (state) Category:Film producers from Ohio ","title":"Fred Ladd"},{"id":"23198948","text":"Acampe praemorsa is a species of monopodial orchid.

Tomahawk Lagoon is a twin-lobed lagoon, located at the western end of the Otago Peninsula within the city limits of Dunedin, New Zealand. It lies close to the southeastern edge of the city's main urban area, near the suburb of Ocean Grove, which lies close to its southern shore. This suburb was also known as Tomahawk until the 1930s.Hamel, A. (2007) Dunedin tracks and trails. Dunedin: Silver Peaks Press.  Name  The name \\"Tomahawk\\", documented in the Otago Witness from 1852, is unlikely to be a reference to the weapon. It is more likely an anglicized form of the MƒÅori words toma haka, often interpreted as \\"dance by a gravesite\\". Toma means a place of bones, or shrine for bones; haka is here taken to mean the MƒÅori dance of challenge, but may rather be the Southern MƒÅori form of the word hanga, to build or create. However, there are no known pre-European burial sites or reported finds of human bones in the area.  Physical geography  The lagoon, which is connected by a short stream to the Pacific Ocean, is noted for its bird life. Despite its name, it is never inundated with the sea, but is more of a shallow coastal lake, predominantly under in depth. The top lagoon (inner lobe) is a wildlife reserve.Herd, J. and Griffiths, G.J. (1980) Discovering Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. . Tomahawk Lagoon is separated from the sea at low tide by Tomahawk Beach, which runs east from the Lagoon's mouth for about . A smaller beach, Smaills Beach, lies further to the east, beyond which is the outcrop of Maori Head, from the lagoon's mouth. A rocky reef and the small Bird Island lie close to the headland. To the west of the lagoon's mouth is the prominent headland of Lawyers Head, a major Dunedin landmark. The outer lobe (the Bottom Lagoon) is the larger, being some in length and wide at its widest point. It is roughly a parallelogram in shape, and covers an area of close to . The Top Lagoon joins the Bottom Lagoon via a short stream in the middle of the latter's eastern shore. It is roughly triangular, being in length and in width, and covers an area of some . The total area of the lagoon is thus some . The total catchment area of the lagoon is . Several small streams flow through the steep valleys which lie to the north and northeast. The largest of these is Lagoon Creek, which flows from near Arthur's Seat for some before feeding the Top Lagoon at its northeastern end. Owing to the pastoral nature of much of the surrounding land, nutrient runoff into the lake is frequently high, resulting in its often eutrophic nature.S. F.

It has been reprinted three times since its first publication and has been released under the alternative title Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga.

It lies close to the border with Buckinghamshire. Its toponym has been attributed to the Old English Pyda's tun. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 370. Manor Just before the Norman conquest of England Hacun, a Dane, held the manor of Piddington, and also the nearby manor of Merton. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 Judith, Countess of Huntingdon, a niece of William I of England held the manor. After the Revolt of the Earls in 1075 Judith's husband Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria was executed and William the Conqueror betrothed her to Simon I de Senlis. She refused to marry him and fled England, so William confiscated her estates and allowed Simon to marry Judith's eldest daughter Maud. Simon received estates including Merton and Piddington as part of the honour of Huntingdon. In 1152 Simon II de Senlis inherited Piddington and almost immediately granted it to the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford. In 1153 Simon II died, and his heir King Malcolm IV of Scotland, confirmed the grant of Piddington to the Priory. However, Malcolm's heir-apparent William the Lion took Piddington back from the Priory. In about 1174 Henry II deprived William of all his titles and lands in England and granted the Earldom of Huntingdon to Simon III de Senlis. Simon acknowledged the Priory's claim to Piddington but continued to hold the overlordship himself, even ignoring a Papal bull upholding the Priory's rights. Joan of Piddington had held the manor of Simon II de Senlis, and in about 1183 she married Aubrey de Dammartin, son of Alb√©ric I de Mello and Dammartin, Grand Chamberman of France. After Aubrey's death the Crown held Piddington in escheat foir several years before it passed to his heir, Reynold de Dammartin. In the Anglo-French War of 1202‚Äì14 Reynold supported Philip II of France against King John, for which he was deprived of his English estates. In 1213 Reynold's estates were restored but when he died in 1227 Henry III seized them again. In 1270 Henry III granted Piddington to a Breton, Alan Plukenet, in exchange for a manor in the New Forest. In 1309 his son, Alan II, granted Piddington to Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, who in turn granted it to John de Hadlow, lord of nearby Boarstall in Buckinghamshire. In 1326 Despenser was executed for rebelling against Edward II and forfeited his estates, but de Hadlow was allowed to keep Piddington until he died in 1346. However, Sybil, widow of Alan Plukenet, successfully claimed a third of Piddington as dower. Also, in 1331 St Frideswide's Priory began a lawsuit to recover Piddington from John de Hadlow. In 1337 Edward III granted Piddington to Nicholas de la Beche of Aldworth and in 1340 de la Beche was licensed to grant Piddington to Sir John Sutton, lord of Dudley. In 1347 Sir John was licensed to grant Piddington to John de Peyto for life, with reversion to Sir John thereafter. Title was then disputed between the Sutton and de Peyto families, but in 1359 the Priory finally succeeded in regaining the manor. St Frideswide's Priory retained Piddington until 1525, when Cardinal Wolsey suppressed the Priory to found his Cardinal's College. In 1530 Henry VIII deposed Wolsey and in 1532 Piddington passed to Christ Church, Oxford. However, in 1553 Piddington was granted to Thomas Dynham, lord of the manors of Brill and Boarstall in Buckinghamshire. In 1634 Thomas's grandson John Dynham died leaving his estates to his daughters Mary and Alice. Piddington seems to have passed to Mary, as her daughter Margaret Lewis was lady of the manor in 1661. Her daughter Mary Jephson inherited Piddington in 1672 and had married Sir John Aubrey, 2nd Baronet by 1691. On her death in 1717 Mary's stepson Sir John Aubrey, 3rd Baronet inherited Piddington, and it remained with the Aubrey baronets until Sir Thomas Digby Aubrey, 7th Baronet died in 1856 and the title became extinct. A cousin of Sir Thomas, Elizabeth Sophia Ricketts, inherited Piddington. Her son Charles Aubrey Ricketts inherited the manor and took the name Charles Aubrey Aubrey. He died in 1901, leaving Piddington to Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 4th Baronet, who was the great grandson of Sir John Aubrey, 3rd Baronet. Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 6th Baronet, also known as the detective novelist Henry Wade, inherited the manor in 1937 and still held it in the 1950s. Church and chapel =Church of England= St Nicholas' parish church: ornate Decorated Gothic sedilia in the chancel St Nicholas' parish church: medieval mural of Saint Christopher carrying Jesus Christ across a river Piddington was originally part of the ecclesiastical parish of Ambrosden. By 1152 \\"Ralph the hermit\\" had established Holy Cross chapel on Muswell Hill about south of the village. Until the English Reformation, Piddington villagers used to process to the chapel on Christian feast days. The last ruins of the chapel are reported to have disappeared in 1800. The chapel of Saint Nicholas in Piddington is known to have existed by 1309. It is now Piddington's Church of England parish church. Its Early English chancel was built in about 1300, but has ornate Decorated Gothic sedilia and Easter Sepulchre carved in about 1350. There is a canonical sundial on the south wall. In the 14th century the Decorated Gothic south aisle was added, with a four-bay arcade and some new two-light windows, but also re-using two Early English lancet windows presumably from the south wall of the nave. A number of Perpendicular Gothic windows were later added to the nave and one to the north wall of the chancel. The present belltower was built in the 16th century. St. Nicholas' parish church was repaired in 1826 and restored in 1855. In 1898 it was restored again under the architect John Oldrid Scott, whose alterations included replacing the chancel arch. A 14th- century wall painting of Saint Christopher on the north wall of the nave was discovered in 1896 and restored in 1935. St. Nicholas' church is a Grade II* listed building. The west tower has a ring of five bells. Edward Hemins of Bicester cast the tenor bell 1729 in and the fourth bell in 1738. Llewellins and James of Bristol cast the treble, second and third bells in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. St Nicholas' parish is part of the Benefice of the Ray Valley, along with the parishes of Ambrosden, Charlton-on- Otmoor, Islip, Merton, Murcott, Noke, Oddington and Woodeaton. =Congregational chapel= The Congregational chapel in the village was founded in 1825 and enlarged at a later date. It was still used for worship in 1951 but has since been converted into a private house. Social and economic history Piddington's former National School, built in 1863 and now a private home The former Seven Stars public house, now the Sunset and Stars restaurant A Sunday school in Piddington was founded in 1818. It became a day school supported by the National Society for Promoting Religious Education in 1858, and a new school building was erected in 1863. In 1925 it was reorganised as a junior and infants' school. It was still open in 1952 but has since closed. In about 1910 the Great Western Railway built a new main line linking Ashendon Junction and to complete a new high-speed route between its termini at and . The line passes within a few hundred metres of Piddington. The GWR opened a railway station called just over east of Piddington. British Railways closed the station in 1953 but the railway remains open as part of the Chiltern Main Line. In 1941 the Bicester Military Railway was built. It connects with the Varsity Line just west of Bicester, runs through the villages of Ambrosden and Arncott and terminates at Piddington, serving various military depots en route. It remains in use today. John Drinkwater (June 1, 1882‚Äì March 25, 1937) who became one of the Dymock poets and a playwright working with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, is buried in St Nicholas' churchyard. He often visited relatives in Piddington and mentioned Piddington in several poems including ‚Ä≤A New Ballard Of Charity‚Ä≤Seeds Of Time published 1922 Riverside Press Cambridge ‚Ä≥...the primroses of Bagley Wood, old apple trees at Piddington.‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≤The Patriot‚Ä≤ from Loyalties published 1919 ‚Ä≥... fields below the rookery that comfortably looks upon the little street of Piddington.‚Ä≥ His gravestone is engraved with words from Amaranth:- ‚Ä≥In some new brain the sleeping dust will waken Courage and love that conquered and were done Called from a night by thought of man forsaken Will know again the gladness of the sun.‚Ä≥ John Drinkwater was related to Flora Thompson through their ancestors:- Drinkwater's great-great-grandfather and Flora's great-great-grandmother were siblings. Flora Thompson's (nee Timms) ancestors the Shaws and the Wallingtons, yeoman farmers, lived in Piddington and are buried outside the porch of the church. Although now very weathered, the oldest gravestone is of John Shaw (1691-1767). Other family graves include one of Elizabeth Shaw nee Beck (1762-1791), Flora's great-great-grandmother whose elder brother was Thomas Beck (1756-1838) John Drinkwater's great-great-grandfather. Flora Thompson's paternal grandmother Martha Wallington (1816-1888) was born in the old farmhouse now a private house at the junction with Widnell Lane. Martha was orphaned at an early age when her mother and three of her siblings died in 1824, followed the next year by the death of her father. Their deaths were probably attributed to infected water from the farmhouse well. Martha was eight, and her orphaned siblings (Edward 17 years, Elizabeth 13 years, Leonard 12 years, and Clementine the youngest at three year) appeared to have raised themselves after uncles could not help them due to their own 'indifferent circumstances'.David Watts and Christin Bloxham.

It is a large-frame automatic rifle with a short barrel and a folding bipod. It has a large compensating muzzle-brake on the end of the barrel to reduce the muzzle-flash, sound and recoil of the heavy round to manageable levels. All demonstrations used iron sights, as it is meant to be used at short ranges. Its purpose was to provide close anti-vehicle support at a strongpoint or roadblock, where engagement range is too close for grenade launchers or rocket launchers. It would also be easier to transport and quicker to set up than a heavy machinegun or automatic-grenade launcher emplacement. Its most effective use would be by military police and border guards at checkpoints. It could also be used by assault troops to take and hold vital transport junctions like crossroads and bridges while waiting to be relieved by follow-on troops. The weapon was never actually adopted by a military force. While a good theory, it would not be very practical. The weapon would be a burden on the squad that would be assigned it, would slow down movement on foot, and would be rarely used. If they did encounter a light armored vehicle, the weapon would be able to get them into trouble and might not get them out of it. It is also trying to perform a task that is already filled by anti-materiel rifles and disposable anti-tank rockets.

Pet recovery =Without identification tagging= A wide variety of pet recovery services exist, such as online services to search for lost pets. Less traditional services for searching for lost pets include use of a bloodhound, a pet detective, a \\"psychic\\", sites that offer advice or a bulk- calling computer that can quickly alert hundreds of neighbors by phone. It may also include websites that offer advice on how to conduct a search. =With identification tagging= External identification Forms of external identification include collar tags with identifying information numbers or QR codes with the pet information or pet recovery service organization information. The pet could be tracked through a service toll-free number or web address on the tag; The service accesses the pet and owner information in a database via a number or QR code. Some pet identification tags include the owner's address or phone number that can be used to reunite the pet with its owner. There are also registry database services based on tattoo registries. Electronic tracking devices Collar-attached electronic tracking devices are used by recovery service providers to unite the pet with its owner. The contract may also include recovery services, which eliminates any need to rely on the pet encountering a helpful stranger. Although, at least one device does also call for help from anyone nearby. Example of an RFID (radio-frequency identification) scanner used with animal microchip implants. Microchip implant Since the early 1990s, the underskin I.D. tag or microchip implant has been promoted as a solution for pet recovery that does not require a collar. Veterinary services, animal shelters, and even some individuals have a chip scanner. In the U.S. such services are unregulated, and several types of chips have emerged with only some adhering to the pertinent ISO standards, ISO 11784 and ISO 11785. Originally each type had its own scanner with no ability to read or even detect other types but there is now a trend to universal scanners able to read all types. In the U.S. more than a dozen pet recovery services maintain databases of chip ID numbers and their associated owners' contact information, and compete with each other not only for the business of the pet owner but also the attention of the pet finder. But unlike the identifying collar tags mentioned above, the appropriate database keeper cannot always be determined from the ID number, complicating the task of returning the pet to its owner. Metasearch engines As an aid to the pet finder in this situation, chip registry metasearch engines have been established. Two that have been available at least since 2003 are Europetnet, which has a large number of participating European registries, and Petmaxx, a worldwide registry service. In 2009, the metasearch engine, sponsored by the American Animal Hospital Association, was put online. Most of the major U.S. registries are now participants. Pets are reunited with their owners by the stray pet's code whose information is accessed via a database. The services are only accessed where chip registry services have decided to interface with metasearch engine services. Successful metasearch engines connect to all the available registries and can help the pet finder or dog warden find the one registry that has an owner record for a found stray. A potential downfall is that if the pet's information is not registered with all the databases, it is possible for a thief to steal the animal using the 'secure and tamper-proof' ID device, register the stolen pet with another database, and then sell the animal on, transferring apparent clear title in the form of a login account at, or registration document from, the second registry. The great downfall with the metasearch engines is that most pounds do not have the manpower to search the registry sites for owner information once they access the chip number. The chip number may simply be entered in the paperwork written up by the pound or other agency, never contacting the owner.  Microchip Registration Database  To ensure lost pets are reunited with their owner its best to have them microchipped and to register it with the chip manufacturer and/or one of the chip agnostic recovery Pet recovery services. An implantable chip is more secure than a collar tag because the chip cannot be moved between pets or lost as can a collar tag. A typical pet microchip registration costs $25 to $100 per year and it is incumbent upon the owner to maintain the accuracy of the database in the event of a move or change in contact information. To remind pet owners to check and update their information, American Animal Hospital Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association have established August 15 as Check a Chip Day. Registering and keeping the owner's contact information up to date is the most problematic problem facing the pet microchip industry because without up to date information a lost pet is less likely to be returned to its owner. According to an Ohio State University study, the main reasons owners aren't found for lost pets included incorrect or disconnected phone numbers (35.4%), owner's failure to return phone calls or respond to letters (24.3%), unregistered microchips (9.8%) or microchips registered in a database that differed from the manufacturer (17.2%).At a, mostly yearly, subscription cost to the owner each microchip manufacture maintains their own registration database. However, these registration databases only hold information related to chips they manufacture requiring a pet finder that does not know who the manufacture is to search multiple sources in order to report a found pet. There are free registration databases available such as those at Veripet's Rabies Reader page and Found Animals are chip manufacture agnostic. Veripet Rescue Association's registration is free for the life of the pet. Veripet also maintains a web page and database of microchip manufacture's recovery phone numbers at their Rabies Reader site (see External Links below) that will provide chip manufacture recovery contact information based solely upon the chip number. Additionally, if a pet is registered with Veripet, their system sends email and SMS notifications containing the finder's contact information to the pet owner without exposing the pet owner's data to the finder; they do not maintain a recovery hotline. A recovery database of last resort at the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) provides a lookup tool (see External Links below) that will redirect a user to the manufacture's recovery desk but not supply owner information or notifications to them. AAHA works only with those manufactures and recovery services that provide a 24x7x365 hot line where a pet finder can report a found pet. They do send notifications to their own registered user base in the form of emails for lost pets. Additional support for animal control and shelters is provided by Veripet's utilization of an Avid 3B Mini-Tracker microchip scanner and its capability to interact with Veripet's mobile app called Rabies Reader available for free on both the Apple App and Google Play stores. The Rabies Reader app acts as a conduit to connect a scanned microchip to Veripet's microchip registration database. A successful scan of a chip results in a myriad of information being presented to the animal control officer or shelter volunteer including the chip manufacture's recovery phone number, the status of the pet's rabies vaccination, owner and vet contact as well as allowing immediate notification to the owner that their loved pet has been located. The information is displayed on the user's mobile device and the scanner's LCD display.

Border dispute  Venezuela claimed more than half of the territory of the British colony of Guyana at the time of the Latin American wars of independence, a dispute that was settled by arbitration in 1899 after the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. In 1962 Venezuela declared that it would no longer abide by the arbitration decision, which ceded mineral-rich territory in the Orinoco basin to Guyana. The disputed area is called Guayana Esequiba by Venezuela. A border commission was set up in 1966 with representatives from Guyana, Venezuela and the United Kingdom, but failed to reach agreement. Venezuela vetoed Guyana's bid to become a member of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1967. In 1969 Venezuela backed an abortive uprising in the disputed area. Under intense diplomatic pressure, Venezuela agreed in 1970 to a 12-year moratorium on the dispute with the Protocol of Port-of-Spain. In 1981, Venezuela refused to renew the protocol. However, with changes to the governments of both countries relations improved, to the extent that Venezuela sponsored Guyana's 1990 bid for OAS membership. In 2013 the Venezuelan navy seized an oil exploration vessel operating in disputed waters claimed as Exclusive Economic Zones by both Venezuela and Guyana. The dispute was taken to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2018. Venezuela did not participate in the hearing that was held on June 30, 2020, arguing that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction.

Monuments The oldest building in the village is a small Orthodox church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.Rupert Gunnis, Historic Cyprus (London, 1936, reprint ed. 1973), p. 438. The church, overlooking a river gorge, was built in several phases. The dome, belonging to the eleventh or twelfth century, indicates the building was first planned as a simple cross-in-square church of the Byzantine type. The nave, as well as the masonry encasing the walls round the base of the dome, were constructed subsequently, probably in the fifteenth or sixteenth century to judge from the style north door. The bell tower on western corner was added later, perhaps in the eighteenth century. Similar additions and sequences are found in many Cypriot churches, a good parallel being the old Agia Marina in Pyrga, Larnaca.A. and J. Stylianou, The Painted Churches of Cyprus (London, 1985), p. 432. Both Jeffery and Gunnis report that English sailors were buried at the Doƒüank√∂y church, but there was no trace of their graves in the 1970s.Jeffery, Description of the Historic Monuments of Cyprus, p. 322; Gunnis, Historic Cyprus, p. 438, who adds that the graves dated to 1882. Gunnis mentions a \\"curious custom\\" whereby any child suffering from malaria was carried three times round the church and rolled back and forth in front of the west door. Inside, the church is white-washed and without decoration; the floor was given modern tiles in the 1950s or 1960s. The iconostasis dates to the nineteenth century; the historic icons were removed before 1974; the frame itself was damaged subsequently. Efforts to repair the church were undertaken beginning in 2000. While the grounds outside were being cleared of weeds, a number of glazed pot-sherds of the fifteenth or sixteenth century were found, testifying to the long life of the building and settlement. Also found beside the church was an early Christian pillar-base in marble; it may have been brought from Lambousa. The village proper is located to the west of the church, suggesting the settlement has shifted or that the church was originally surrounded by its own properties. The stone houses in the village retain the vernacular Gothic elements sometimes found in the traditional domestic buildings of Cyprus; according to Gunnis, the oldest of them dates to about 1740. This was the family home of Dimitris Lipertis, best known for his poetry in the Cypriot dialect. The building was heavily restored in 1971-72 by the Department of Antiquities at which time two ruinous rooms to the east side of the house were rebuilt.Republic of Cyprus, Ministry of Communications and Works, Annual Report of the Director of the Department of Antiquities for the year 1972 (Nicosia, 1973), p. 15.

It can be broadly compared to Google's GFS and MapReduce technology. Sector is a distributed file system targeting data storage over a large number of commodity computers. Sphere is the programming architecture framework that supports in-storage parallel data processing for data stored in Sector. Sector/Sphere operates in a wide area network (WAN) setting. The system was created by Yunhong Gu (the author of UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol) in 2006 and was then maintained by a group of other developers. Architecture Sector/Sphere consists of four components. The security server maintains the system security policies such as user accounts and the IP access control list. One or more master servers control operations of the overall system in addition to responding to various user requests. The slave nodes store the data files and process them upon request. The clients are the users' computers from which system access and data processing requests are issued. Also, Sector/Sphere is written in C++ and is claimed to achieve with its architecture a two to four times better performance than the competitor Hadoop which is written in Java,Sector vs. Hadoop - A Brief Comparison Between the Two Systems a statement supported by an Aster Data Systems benchmarkSector/ Sphere ‚Äì Faster than Hadoop/Mapreduce at Terasort September 26, 2010 Ajay Ohri and the winning of the \\"bandwidth challenge\\" of the Supercomputing Conference 2006,NCDM Wins Bandwidth Challenge at SC06, HPCWire, November 24, 2006 2008,UIC Groups Win Bandwidth Challenge Award, HPCWire, November 20, 2008 and 2009.Open Cloud Testbed Wins Bandwidth Challenge at SC09, December 8, 2009 Architecture of Sector/Sphere with its four components. =Sector = Sector is a user space file system which relies on the local/native file system of each node for storing uploaded files. Sector provides file system-level fault tolerance by replication, thus it does not require hardware fault tolerance such as RAID, which is usually very expensive. Sector does not split user files into blocks; instead, a user file is stored intact on the local file system of one or more slave nodes. This means that Sector has a file size limitation that is application specific. The advantages, however, are that the Sector file system is very simple, and it leads to better performance in Sphere parallel data processing due to reduced data transfer between nodes. It also allows uploaded data to be accessible from outside the Sector system. Sector provides many unique features compared to traditional file systems. Sector is topology aware. Users can define rules on how files are located and replicated in the system, according to network topology. For example, data from a certain user can be located on a specific cluster and will not be replicated to other racks. For another example, some files can have more replicas than others. Such rules can be applied at per- file level. The topology awareness and the use of UDT as data transfer protocol allows Sector to support high performance data IO across geographically distributed locations, while most file systems can only be deployed within a local area network. For this reason, Sector is often deployed as a content distribution network for very large datasets. Sector integrates data storage and processing into one system. Every storage node can also be used to process the data, thus it can support massive in-storage parallel data processing (see Sphere). Sector is application aware, meaning that it can provide data location information to applications and also allow applications to specify data location, whenever necessary. As a simple example of the benefits of Sphere, Sector can return the results from such commands as \\"grep\\" and \\"md5sum\\" without reading the data out of the file system. Moreover, it can compute the results of multiple files in parallel. The Sector client provides an API for application development which allows user applications to interact directly with Sector. The software also comes prepackaged with a set of command-line tools for accessing the file system. Finally, Sector supports the FUSE interface; presenting a mountable file system that is accessible via standard command-line tools. =Sphere = Sphere is a parallel data processing engine integrated in Sector and it can be used to process data stored in Sector in parallel. It can broadly compared to MapReduce, but it uses generic user defined functions (UDFs) instead of the map and reduce functions. A UDF can be either a map function or a reduce function, or even others. Sphere can manipulate the locality of both input data and output data, thus it can effectively support multiple input datasets, combinative and iterative operations and even legacy application executable. Because Sector does not split user files, Sphere can simply wrap up many existing applications that accepts files or directories as input, without rewriting them. Thus it can provide greater compatibility to legacy applications.

Headquarters for the monastery are presently located in Nicosia due to the Turkish occupation.\\"Exarchies of the All Holy Sepulchre\\" Jerusalem Patriarchate; archived by WebCite on 29 February 2012 The original south church was destroyed and rebuilt in 1891. This building was the katholikon of the entire monastery. The new south church was rebuilt on the foundations of the old structure and in a rectangular fashion, having three bays, and is covered by pointed cross-groin vaults. Surviving portions of the original church include the pavement, marble door frames, and a carved wooden door. The north church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, is what would be considered a \\"compressed cross-in-square type\\" that is off axis due to the narthex of the south church that projects into its space. The founder of the chapel and donor for the painted decorations was the Governor of Cyprus, Eumathios Philokales. Out of all the Byzantine era buildings in the relative location,this is the most well preserved. The architectural type is that of a single aisle domed structure. While the building is created largely from brick, what is unique is that the dome is also constructed of brick alternating with stone that is framed by bricks.  Wall Paintings at the Monastery of St. John Chrysostomos  The restoration of wall paintings at Koutsovendis was carried out by Dumbarton Oaks in 1963 and 1968-1969. Further visits and restoration projects have been prevented due to Turkish occupation of the area. While not all the paintings are in good condition, if they exist at all, some that have been eroded show preliminary sketches. Many of the original frescoes included details of gold, vermilion, and lapis lazuli. 291x291px = Frescoes on the Dome = In respect to the dome, the entire interior surface was at one point covered entirely in a single composition depicting the Pentecost. Between each of the twelve windows sat apostles. All that remains currently are remnants and preliminary sketches made in red ocher upon bare masonry. Around the calotte of the dome are remnants of two circles that would have represented the glory of the Etimasia. There exists a segment of a halo between windows nine and ten. A larger section of the painting still remains between windows ten and eleven and shows the upper half of a seated figure. A majority of the head is missing, but the beard and lower segment of the halo can still be seen. One can see the fold of his chlamys pass from his left shoulder to the height of his right knee . While no painting exists between windows eleven and twelve, there is a preserved drawing on the plaster and masonry. The figure appears to be St. Peter with a short beard and curly hair. The right hand is lifted with the palm facing outward in the form of blessing with the left hand holding a scroll. = Frescoes in the Apse = Unfortunately, much of the decoration within the apse was destroyed due to the central portion collapsing. However, there is still some fragmentary fresco decoration throughout. In the conch of the apse, one can discern two archangels standing against a dark blue background. One holds an orb while the other grasps a staff. All that is left of the leftmost angel is the outer edge of the right wing and the orb that was held in his right hand. The second archangel is just as poorly preserved. Part of the wing is discernible in an under painting along with the lower half of the staff. Between the angels stands the Virgin Mary. These three figures reside above a life sized procession of bishops clothed in pale garments and holding open scrolls. While only two can still be seen on either side of the bema, it is thought that there were originally eight. One of the bishops is perhaps St. Basil, but the other remaining figure remains nameless. The bishop thought to be St. Basil, located on the north wall of the bema, is preserved to below the knees and exhibits short dark hair and a long beard.The scroll is held in both hands and bears a text from the prayer of the first antiphon of St. Basil's liturgy. The vault of the bema holds a fresco of the Ascension with, what would have been six, apostles looking up at Christ being carried by four angels in a mandorla. All that remains of the angels is the right arm, right wing, and a portion of the halo. On the north side there are only remnants of two apostles. The leftmost figure is presented in a three-quarter view from behind. His right hand is seen shielding his eyes. The second apostle is painted in a more profile view. His entire right half is missing along with his left arm. He is shown in a gray tunic and purple-brown chlamys. The south side has only one remaining apostle. His body faces west while the head is turned in the eastward direction. The right arm has not been preserved, but within the apostle's left hand a tied scroll is held. Upon the face of the apse, in the southeast corner of the bema, there remains fragments of a bishop from just below the eyes to elbow level. His brown beard is outlined in white while coming to a point at the collarbone. Dressed in a brown mantle and a white epitrachelion adorned with small black crosses, the bishop holds a gilded book in his left hand. = The South Wall = Approximately one-eighth of the painted surface of the south wall has been preserved. These fragments can be found in the soffit of the arch, a low register on the wall, and on the dado below the lowest register. Within the soffit was seven medallions with the busts of saints. There is only one that is well preserved.\\"The medallions were 72-74 cm in diameter, including the yellow-ochre frame...which was outlines with an inner black line and an outer white line. The background of the soffit was a blue-black and that of the medallions alternately green and red...the haloes of all the saints were yellow ochre, outlines in white and red-brown along the outer circumference.\\" The entire south wall was covered with a fresco of the Anastasis originally. A door has been placed incorrectly due to construction to preserve the integrity of the building, so it seems as if the painting is cut short on one side. What remains of the composition are fragments of Christ towards the middle of the image, David, Solomon, and John the Baptist on the left side of Christ, and the remaining hand that would have belonged to Adam on the right side. All that remains of Christ is his head and the portion of his body extending form his hips to just below the knees. He is flanked by two angels on the left side of his head. John displays his characteristic shaggy hair and beard. His right arm is positioned pointing towards Christ while holding a folded scroll in his left. \\"David and Solomon stand in identical poses, their left arms raised in the same awkward vertical position, and are dressed in the same costume...The two prophets wear identical crowns composed of six \\"gold\\" (yellow ochre) plaques,\\". Solomon is shown without a beard and as a man of youth adorned with a gilded halo. All three prophets are shown standing on a marble sarcophagus. = The North Wall = The north wall lacks remains of the wall paintings. There were originally four compositions that were arranged within three registers: The Betrayal, the Judgement of Pilate, and the Road to Calvary, and a depiction of the Crucifixion in the lower section. Only the outer circumference of the painting of the Betrayal survives along with an inscription.

There are well preserved Byzantine tombs. The stone steps lead dawn to eight subterranean chambers, all hewn out of the solid rock with r remarkable precision for the crude tools of those days. The tomb architecture is exactly the same as in the catacombs of Kyrenia, using similar tool markings can be seen above arched entrance. There are a number of other tombs here, whose entrances are concealed by the evergreen shrub, \\"Skinia\\" with the entrances blocked by large stones. This necropolis is a sure sign of a near-by Byzantine town. Continuing towards the sea we come to fields with piles of stones in the v, or piled up to form field boundaries, and close examination reveals that they must have come from buildings. Here there are several ancient quarries where the workings have been converted into small rectangular houses, one of which is shown in fig. 42. We are now on the outskirts of the ancient town and between the quarries arid the cove is a small flat piece of land strewn with stones and masses of pottery sherds of all ages, ranging from Byzantine, through mediaeval to the pre plastic era of 50 years ago. The theory of continuous occupation from Roman to medieval times is supported by the presence of another necropolis, of a different type, close to the cliffs on the east. Here there are piles of stones in heaps concealed by \\"skinia\\" bushes, with here and there carved stones that seem to be of a much later date, but they are not catacombs. Visitors to Cyprus always remark about so much pottery sherds lying about the countryside.

Plot The movie begins with a sole grave robber in 1979, who steals his way into the crypt in order to find jewelry. He is killed by the undead after he finds some jewelry and is trying to get more. Decades later, a man is shown getting out of prison. His girlfriend picks him up at the prison gate with a car and takes him to a meeting place with some of her friends. There, one experienced thief, a lady, says that she knows how to make a whole lot of money quickly by getting jewelry from a crypt under the city and that she has connections able to sell the jewelry for them. She shows the others a gold ring from down below. She says that rich families during the Great Depression in the U.S. were afraid that the government would take the jewelry away from them, so they buried their riches in the crypts with the remains of their family members. At first the others are very unhappy about the idea of the scheme and are about to leave, but the ringleader manages to persuade them to go with her. The group makes it into the crypt and the members fill their backpacks with diamond necklaces and other expensive jewelry from the concrete coffins, but one by one several of the members of the group are killed by the undead, who apparently are taking revenge for the people taking the jewelry. In the end, only the ringleader and the girlfriend of the one guy who was released from prison make it out of the crypt alive. Before they leave the crypt, they get rid of the jewelry, one of them saying that they would not get out of there alive with it. Once back at her apartment, the ringleader finds a very expensive diamond studded piece of jewelry in her belongings that she remembers having put in her brassiere while first treasure hunting in the crypt. She shows her friend, but her friend is really angry about it and wants her to get rid of it apparently because she fears that the undead would come out of the crypt to kill them. The ringleader puts the piece of jewelry in her car and is later killed by the same undead individual who killed most of the other people. The remaining lady has a dream that her boyfriend, the one newly released from prison, is an undead and is angry at her for having left him down in the crypt. She goes back down into the crypt and sees that he is still alive. She dumps the jewelry that he has into the water, but he indicates that he is not sure that it is all of the jewelry that he has. Right after that, the undead kills the boyfriend by crushing his head. His girlfriend is shown in shock leaning up against the wall of the crypt. The movie ends.

The resultant firestorm destroyed most of the city.Bradley. No Strategic Targets Left. Shizuoka civil defense measures were crude at best. Air raid shelters consisted of a hole in the ground next to wooden houses with a wooden roof covered with a thin layer of soil and clay. Due to the high ground water levels in the area, these shelters were shallow, and many people were burned alive in the firestorm. The estimated civilian casualties in the June 19 raid were 1,952 people killed, an estimated 12,000 were severely injured, and 26,891 homes were destroyed.

He was born and raised in Linden, New Jersey. Early life Dixon spent his youth honing his streetball skills at his favorite hometown court, 4th Ward Park. He attended Linden High School and was chosen by Street & Smith as an All-American after his senior season in 1991‚Äì92. Dixon graduated as its all-time leading scorer (1,760 points) and officially concluded his prep career by winning the Reebok National Slam Dunk Contest. He chose to stay in New Jersey to play college basketball and attended Rutgers University. Despite a lot of success at the high school level, Dixon's career as a Scarlet Knight was not noteworthy. He played for just two seasons (1992‚Äì94) and averaged 9.6 points in 26 games played. Professional career =AND1= In 1994, a videotape of the Entertainer's Basketball Classic at Harlem's Rucker Park was found by two of AND1 Basketball's partners, Jay Coen Gilbert and Seth Berger. The tape, which wound up being the AND1 Mix Tape Volume One, gave national exposure to streetball. It featured some of the jaw-dropping moves of a then little-known player named Waliyy Dixon. Then, in the summer of 1999, before the AND1 Mixtape Tour ever existed, Dixon met with several AND1 representatives. After discussing the streetball scene he helped bring other streetballers to the AND1 family. He then worked with AND1 to host the original AND1 Mix Tape game later that summer at his home court in Linden. More than 2,000 people showed up to 4th Ward Park to watch what turned into footage for Mix Tape Vol. 2. \\"Main\\" and the other streetballers were then signed to endorsement deals that fall. Dixon would play for the AND1 Mix Tape Tour from 2001 through 2006. Nickname origin During high school Dixon was known locally via the Newark Star Ledger as \\"The Coming Attraction\\" based on his skills and aerial flair. At Rucker Park in the early 1990s, Dixon completed a 360 degree dunk that stunned the crowd. It earned him the name \\"The Main Event\\" as he began to attract a huge following to Rucker games. =Other leagues= Waliyy Dixon played professionally in the United States Basketball League (USBL) for the Atlantic City Seagulls and Long Island Surf. He also spent some time in training camp with the New Jersey Nets before the 2004 and 2005 NBA seasons. Life after AND1 =Ball4Real= In his post-AND1 Mix Tape Tour life, Dixon has embarked on several basketball- related projects. Ball4Real, a streetball tour similar in nature to AND1, was co-created by Main Event and a handful of other former AND1 players. It started in 2007, but after less than a year and a half it disbanded due to lack of revenue and media support. =S.K.Y. Streetball Syndicate= S.K.Y., an acronym for Serving Knowledge to Youth, is the name for a new clothing organization, Streetball Syndicate. It focuses on special basketball tours and community outreach programs. Dixon is a co-founder of the organization with other streetball players, some of whom used to also tour for AND1. He currently serves as the Vice President of Player Development and works out of his hometown of Linden, New Jersey. References External links *AND1 * *Goals of S.K.Y.

Nurses in Hong Kong are classified into registered nurses (RN; ) and enrolled nurses (EN; ). RNs may handle patients independently, whereas ENs must work under the supervision of RNs. RNs have a higher academic and professional attainment and must train for a longer period of time; correspondingly, they also have higher salaries and may be promoted to higher positions such as Nursing Officer (). In contrast, ENs do not have a clear path for promotion; in order for ENs to be promoted to higher positions, they must take further studies such as conversion or top-up courses. Psychiatric nurses have a higher starting salary then nurses serving general patients. Education All nursing programmes in Hong Kong have to approved by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong. Registered nurses must undergo at least 3 years of training, either via theoretical and practical training at a nursing school based in hospitals, or via a pre-registration nursing programme at a university or college; whereas, enrolled nurses must take a programme of at least 2 years in duration. Among programmes that lead to qualification as RNs, the Higher Diploma in Nursing programme offered by the Hospital Authority is 3 years in duration, while bachelor's degrees offered by universities and post- secondary colleges are 5 years in duration.

Early life Winter was born in Dubuque, Iowa on December 8, 1957. Winter attended Catholic school for grade school and high school, and had two years of Catholic college before he transferred to Iowa State University at Ames. ‚ÄúA nun introduced me to the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in high school ... Previously, I had been mostly into historical novels and military history. For the next several years, I read all the fantasy I could get my hands on ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt enjoy very much of it. I couldn‚Äôt find anything with the same sense of humor and style as Tolkien. I also read a lot of science fiction.‚Äù In 1978, while attending college, Winter worked part-time at a department store which carried a few wargames in its small games department. He began playing with the wargame The Russian Campaign by Avalon Hill; ‚ÄúThe Russian Campaign intrigued me, so I bought Tobruk, which was the game that changed my life. I played it to death.‚Äù At Iowa State University, Winter was majoring in journalism. ‚ÄúI worked on the campus newsletter, which, incidentally, was the seventh largest daily newspaper in Iowa. One day, I was proofreading the classified ad column, and came across an ad for the Iowa State Gamers. I went to their next meeting, and was introduced to the D&D; game ... From then on, I played all day every Saturday, but I never was one of those 5-hour-a-day,7-day-a-week gamers. The newspaper took up most of my time, and I had my heart set on becoming a journalist.‚Äù Career After graduating, Winter got a job on the Peoria (Ill.) Journal-Star as a city desk reporter. ‚ÄúThe first night I was there I covered the first murder in Peoria for over a year. I also covered Reagan‚Äôs last campaign appearance in 1980. Then there were less exciting jobs, like covering the Mass Transit Board.‚Äù His position with the Peoria Journal Star was a temporary position, and he was laid off after the woman he was substituting for came back from maternity leave. ‚ÄúOne day I was in a hobby shop in Peoria, and saw an issue of DRAGON Magazine that mentioned that TSR was looking for editors. I sent my resume, and got an interview. I ended up coming to Lake Geneva three times. The first time, my car broke down, and I had to call and postpone the interview. The second time, everything worked out. But on the third trip, my car broke down again, but I was within five miles of Lake Geneva, so I was able to get it towed in.‚Äù Winter began with TSR in May 1981 as a Games Editor. In this position, he is credited as the editor of both Star Frontiers boxed games, the Gangbusters games, the 1983 World of Greyhawk revision, and the Top Secret Companion. Winter was promoted to Manager of Game Editors in 1984, and continued working on many different projects in addition to his management duties, including editing half of the book Oriental Adventures. Jeff Grubb and Winter designed the Marvel Super Heroes RPG. He has worked on many game products for the Dungeons & Dragons game since 1981, as a designer, editor, coordinator, and creative director. Some of his works as a game designer include Ruins of Adventure, The Complete Psionics Handbook, the 3rd edition version of Monster Manual II, and Lords of Madness. Winter co-wrote the Dragonlance novel Wanderlust with Mary Kirchoff. Winter ran annual miniatures events at the Gen Con game convention, including the Car Wars ‚ÄúLake Geneva Death Rally‚Äù series. Winter wrote \\"The Art of Three-Dimensional Gaming\\" booklet for the Battlesystem Fantasy Combat Supplement.

It was designed and produced by Shin-Chu≈ç Industries, later merged with Minebea. \\"New Nambu\\" was named after Kijir≈ç Nambu, a notable firearm designer and the founder of Shin-Chu≈ç Industries. Approximately 133,400 have been produced since 1961. Production was completed in the 1990s, but it's still one of the standard firearms carried by law enforcement officers in Japan. History In the pre-war era, most Japanese law enforcement officials had only a sabre. During the Occupation, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers suggested that they be equipped with firearms. Because of the insufficient stocks of the domestic handguns, Japanese police started to receive service firearms leased from the Allies from 1949, and by 1951, all officers were issued handguns. At the beginning, types of sidearm varied, but M1911 pistols and M1917 revolvers, Smith & Wesson Military & Police and Colt Official Police were used as the main sidearm. The .38 caliber revolvers were well-received, but .45 caliber handguns were too large to carry for somewhat small officers especially women. M1917 revolvers were beginning to be seen as obsolete and deteriorated significantly, so malfunctions or reduced accuracy had been a problem. As a response to these issues, the National Rural Police Headquarters (one of the predecessors of the National Police Agency) and some Municipal Police Departments (predecessors of Prefectural Police Departments) started to import small .38 Special caliber revolvers such as Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special and Colt Detective Special. But there were many handguns to be replaced, and with the policy of protecting industrial growth, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) had been oriented to domestic production of service firearms. In 1957, the development was started by Shin-Chu≈ç Industries under the leadership of the MITI to promote domestic firearms production. The development of three handguns had been promoted at the same time in parallel: .32 ACP caliber semi- automatic pistols, 9√ó19mm Parabellum caliber semi-automatic pistols, and .38 Special caliber revolvers. Semi-automatic pistols were completed as New Nambu M57, but both of them did not enter into mass production. On the other hand, the revolver, completed as New Nambu M60, was satisfactory for the National Police Agency, and mass production was started in 1960. Production was completed in 1999. Deployment of small semi-automatic pistols was considered afterward, but this plan was abandoned after small numbers of SIG Sauer P230 were deployed. Finally, imports from the United States was resumed. The Smith & Wesson Model 37 and a variant of Model 360 revolvers (SAKURA M360J) have been purchased for uniformed officers.  Design  Basic design was based on those of the \\"J-Frame\\" and \\"K-Frame\\" revolvers of Smith & Wesson company. The revolver has a five-round cylinder, but does not fit a \\"J-Frame\\" speedloader because the actual cylinder is slightly larger. The weapon's barrel has 5 grooves, with a right hand twist and 1 turn in 15 inches. Barrel lengths vary from 2 to 3 inches. The trigger mechanism is double-action/single-action. The Minebea M60's accuracy is excellent in single-action shooting, capable of groupings of at . Variants The M60 was manufactured with either two or three inch barrels as described above. A sport-use intended variant equipped with weighted longer barrel, adjustable rear sight, and adjustable competition grip called the New Nambu M60 Sakura was considered for production, but the product never went past its prototype phase. Only three prototypes were exported for Europe.

It also fostered links between far-right groups and individuals in the United States and the United Kingdom. According to BNP Chairman Nick Griffin, the group made a \\"significant contribution to the BNP's [2001] general election campaign\\". History and activities It operated from a small apartment in Falls Church, Virginia for much of its history. Griffin and party figure Richard Barnbrook attended meetings to give support and to connect with American far-right activists. In an April 2000 seminar in Texas, Griffin met with David Duke, Samuel T. Francis, Kirk Lyons, chairman of Southern Legal Resource Center and Roy Armstrong, a member of the National Democratic Party of Germany.April 2000 meeting He gave a speech in which he said: > The BNP isn't about selling out its ideas, which are your ideas too, but we > are determined to sell them.

[...] Once we're in a > position where we control the British broadcasting media, then perhaps one > day the British people might change their mind and say, 'yes, every last one > must go'.

Nobody can criticise them. Nobody > can come at you and attack you on those ideas. They are saleable. He met with white nationalist Don Black in another meeting. Issues advocated by the AFBNP included opposition to the NATO's intervention in the former Yugoslavia and the importance of \\"pan-Aryan\\" internationalism. Members of far right movements such as the Christian Identity, the Council of Conservative Citizens, American neo-Nazism, and various neo-confederate groups participated in their meetings. The AFBNP also published a bimonthly magazine called Heritage and Destiny. In fall 2000, it attempted to gain influence within state chapters of the American Reform Party, but it was unsuccessful. On November 7, 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service prevented Cotterill from re-entering the country, saying that he lied about his initial reasons for coming in 1999 and summarily violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

B√ºhlmann (16 May 1923 ‚Äì 16 March 1994) was a Swiss physician who was principally responsible for a number of important contributions to decompression science at the Laboratory of Hyperbaric Physiology at the University Hospital in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. His impact on diving ranged from complex commercial and military diving to the occasional recreational diver. He is held in high regard for his professional ethics and attention to his research subjects. Background After completing his education at the University of Z√ºrich, B√ºhlmann specialized in pathophysiology of the respiratory and circulatory systems. He was particularly interested in respiratory physiology at high altitudes and high pressure environments. B√ºhlmann decompression algorithm The B√ºhlmann decompression algorithm is used to create decompression tables. In 1959, Hannes Keller became interested in deep diving and developed tables for mixed-gas decompression. Not a diver himself, B√ºhlmann was intrigued by project and suggested suitable breathing gases. Keller successfully tested his idea in the Lake Zurich where he reached a depth of 400 feet and then Lake Maggiore where he reached a depth of 728 feet. Building on the previous work of John Scott Haldane and Robert Workman, and with funding from Shell Oil Company, B√ºhlmann designed studies to establish the longest half-times of nitrogen and helium. These studies were confirmed by the Capshell experiments in the Mediterranean Sea in 1966. The naming convention he used to describe his algorithms, for example, ZH-L16, comes from Z√ºrich (ZH), limits (L) and the number of tissue compartments or M-value sets used (16). In 1962, Keller set a new world record when he reached a depth of 1000 feet off the coast of California utilizing B√ºhlmann's algorithm in a study funded by the United States Navy. Two out of eight Swiss military divers suffered decompression sickness following dives 1800 meters above sea level in Lake Silvaplana. B√ºhlmann recognized the problems associated with altitude diving, and proposed a method which calculated maximum nitrogen loading in the tissues at a particular ambient pressure. The tables developed were adopted by the Swiss military in 1972. An expedition to Lake Titicaca at 3800 meters above sea level in 1987 revealed no decompression issues while utilizing B√ºhlmann's ZH-L16 algorithm. In addition to altitude diving, his calculations also include considerations for repetitive dive profiles. The results of B√ºhlmann's research that began in 1959, was published in a 1983 German book entitled Decompression-Decompression Sickness. An English version of this book became available in 1984. The book was regarded as the most complete public reference on decompression calculations and was used soon after in dive computer algorithms. Two follow-up books were published in 1992 and 1995. In 1987 the SAA B√ºhlmann System was developed. This system used the dive tables and a set of rules so that people could dive safely and stay below their no-decompression limit. The tables are still used today and are very popular, many dive computers still use the ZHL-8 algorithm and many tables are based on the ZHL-16 algorithm. Death B√ºhlmann died unexpectedly of heart failure on 16 March 1994. Awards The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society gave B√ºhlmann the Oceaneering award in 1977. In 1993, the Divers Alert Network presented B√ºhlmann with an award for his life's work in the service of decompression science. References External links * An Explanation of Professor A.A.

History  Exterior of OOBHS The Old Orchard Beach school system was established in 1881 after being separated from the neighboring Saco, Maine school system. Rev. W. W. H. McAllister, who would later be elected the first Supervisor of Schools, lobbied for the establishment of a High School with town officials due to tax incentives from the state. The high school's first day of operation was . The school originally resided in what is today Loranger Middle School, another school within RSU 23. The school moved to a new building across from its previous location in the late 1970s. In 2009, the Saco, Old Orchard Beach, and Dayton school systems combined to form Regional School Unit (RSU) 23 under the state's educational consolidation program. The school systems remained unified until July of 2014, when Saco and Dayton withdrew, leaving Old Orchard Beach the sole town in the system. Between 2009 and 2014, OOBHS (with some limited exceptions) still only served residents of Old Orchard Beach, despite being consolidated with the two other townships.

Topics discussed include the moon landing conspiracy theories, the Bilderberg Group, the Illuminati, the Warren Commission and the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories, the views of David Icke, and chupacabras. The encyclopedia has a section on assassinations, and those discussed include the deaths of Kenneth Bigley in 2004, Danny Casolaro in 1991, John F. Kennedy in 1963, and Tutankhamun in 1323 BC.

In a review of the encyclopedia for The Guardian, Andrew Mueller called it a \\"beautifully-produced tome\\" and commented that the work \\"succeeds, as was probably intentional, in offering some fascinating tours of the byways of history and providing a tantalising alternative universe in which much of what you know may not be what it seems\\". John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as \\"an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda\\". Cooper noted, \\"The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations' ... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas.\\" Martin Samuel gave a more critical review of the encyclopedia for The Times, commenting, \\"For all the encyclopedia's pretence at sifting the evidence in search of a verdict, if the truth is out there, the authors are damned if they can find it.\\" Conspiracy Encyclopedia was listed as required reading in a 2008 course on conspiracy at Harvard University. Writing in Conspiracy Theories & Secret Societies For Dummies, authors Christopher Hodapp and Alice Von Kannon comment that Burnett asserts \\"the spirit of our times has had the crap kicked out of it by global domination\\". The encyclopedia is recommended for further reading by David Southwell and Sean Twist in their book Unsolved Political Mysteries. Writing for The Star, James Mitchell observed, \\"There's a huge amount packed in here, simply presented.\\" Mitchell concluded, \\"Read the Conspiracy Encyclopedia, and you'll either have your worst fears confirmed that there's a grand, unified conspiracy affecting everything ... or less exciting, that most of the time, vanilla rules: What you see is what you get!\\" Editions * See also *Cabal *Conspiracy (crime) *List of conspiracy theories References External links * Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:American encyclopedias Category:Books about conspiracy theories Category:21st-century encyclopedias ","title":"Conspiracy Encyclopedia"},{"id":"23200566","text":"Artistic depiction of a drop bear The drop bear (sometimes dropbear), assigned the fictional scientific name Thylarctos plummetus, is a hoax in contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous version of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). This imaginary animal is commonly spoken about in tall tales designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores (and are not bears), drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.Staff Writers.

The marsupial lion was a formidable carnivorous mammal, and as a member of the suborder Vombatiformes, distantly related to the koala. It is thought to have been an ambush predator capable of climbing trees, and a specialised hunter capable of taking down megafauna such as the rhino-sized diprotodon. Formerly widely distributed, well-preserved Thylacoleo fossil remains and scratch marks have been found in caves under the Nullarbor Plain and elsewhere. They became extinct around 46.000 years ago, and may have been depicted in Aboriginal rock art in the Kimberley region and persisted in Aboriginal myth.Jamie Siedel, Scratch marks in a WA cave show the ‚Äòdrop bear‚Äô (thylacoleo carnifex) could climb particularly well news.com.au 15 February 2016. Retrieved 8 September 2020. Stories and tall tales Stories about drop bears are generally used as an in-joke intended to frighten and confuse outsiders while amusing locals, similar to the jackalope and other North American fearsome critters. Tourists are the main targets of such stories.Miller, John, The Lingo Dictionary: Of Favourite Australian Words and Phrases. p. 88. 2011. These tales are often accompanied by advice that the hearer adopt various tactics purported to deter drop bear attacks‚Äîincluding placing forks in the hair, having Vegemite or toothpaste spread behind the ears or in the armpits, urinating on oneself, and only speaking English in an Australian accent.Canberra City News, \\"Spreading the Myth\\", 6 August 2003. Popularisation The website of the Australian Museum contains an entry for the drop bear written in a serious tone similar to entries for other, real, species. The entry classifies the Drop Bear as Thylarctos plummetus and describes them as \\"a large, arboreal, predatory marsupial related to the koala\\", the size of a leopard, having coarse orange fur with dark mottling, with powerful forearms for climbing and attacking prey, and a bite made using broad powerful premolars rather than canines. Specifically it states that they weigh and have a length of . The tongue-in-cheek entry was created for \\"silly season\\".Australian Museum - In the News Dec 2010 Describes the entry on Drop Bears as being inspired by \\"the 'silly season.'\\" The Australian Museum also established a small display in the museum itself, exhibiting artefacts which it stated \\"may, or may not, relate to actual Drop Bears.\\" Australian Geographic ran an article on its website on 1 April 2013 (April Fools' Day) purporting that researchers had found that drop bears were more likely to attack tourists than people with Australian accents. The article was based on a 2012 paper published in Australian Geographer, and despite referencing the Australian Museum entry on drop bears in several places, images included with the Australian Geographic article were sourced from Australian Geographer and did not match the Australian Museum's species description. The drop bear featured also in an advertisement for Bundaberg Rum. In the ad, the rum's mascot, the Bundy Bear is with a group of young men on a camping trip. As the men are sharing and opening cans of the rum, they notice a group of young female German tourists setting up a tent nearby. In an apparent attempt to win the women's attention, the men explain to them that they cannot camp there due to the presence of drop bears, and clumsily attempt to explain what a drop bear is. As the women show signs of knowing it is a hoax, the Bundy Bear drops from a tree above onto their tent, sending them screaming to the men's camp area. He gestures to one of the men from the ground, who acknowledges his support in winning the women's attention. The ad ends with the entire group, including the bear, sharing Bundaberg Rum at the men's campsite. The feature film Drop, based around the concept of the drop bear, will be released to cinemas in 2021. In the Discworld novel The Last Continent by Terry Pratchett drop bears inhabit the continent of Fourecks, a land portrayed as a parody of Australia. This version of the drop bear tale sees the animals with well padded backsides to cushion their fall.

The courts are organized at four levels, with additional provision for appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. The Court of Appeal is the highest appellate court. The Supreme Court has unlimited jurisdiction in all cases, and sits as the Circuit Court to try criminal cases. The Parish Court (formerly known as the Resident Magistrate's court) in each parish hears both criminal and civil cases, excluding grave offences. The Petty Sessions are held under Justices of the Peace, with power to hear minor crimes. Jamaica is a common law jurisdiction, in which precedents from English law and British Commonwealth tradition may be taken into account. Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal is the highest appellate court in Jamaica; it is superior to the Supreme Court.The Judicature (Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, article 10 The Court is composed of a President and six other Judges. The Chief Justice is also a judge ex officio of the Court of Appeal, but participates only when asked to do so by the President. Although the Court of Appeal is the highest court in Jamaica, its judgements may themselves be appealed to the Queen-in- Council, in which case they are heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. In May 2015, the House of Representatives approved with the necessary two-thirds majority bills to end legal appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and make the Caribbean Court of Justice as Jamaica's final court of appeal. The reform will be debated by the Senate. However, the government will need the support of at least one opposition senator for the measures to be approved by the required two-thirds majority. Supreme Court The Supreme Court has unlimited original jurisdiction in criminal and civil cases. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is the head of the judiciary (currently Bryan Sykes). Besides the Chief Justice, the court is composed of the Senior Puisne Judge and additional Puisne Judges, with their number established by Parliament. In response to increasing case load, Parliament in 2008 increased the number of spaces on the Supreme Court from 26 to 40 with the new spaces filled over time by appointment of new judges. The Supreme Court has a number of divisions, in which a subset of the justices hear specific types of cases. The Circuit Court is the division for criminal cases, holding sessions in the individual parishes. The Justices of the Peace (Appeals) Act states that the \\"Circuit Court for every parish in this Island shall be the Appeal Court for matters arising in every such parish.\\"The Justices of the Peace (Appeals) Act, article 22 Other divisions of the Supreme Court are the Gun Court, the Commercial Court, the Revenue Court, and the Family Court. In the civil division of the Supreme Court the judge sits alone without the jury, except in cases of defamation. The Supreme Court also serves as a Constitutional Court for Jamaica. Parish Courts Each parish has a Parish Court with power to hear civil and criminal matters. The jurisdiction of each court extends one mile beyond the border of its parish. Severe crimes such as rape, treason, and murder are not tried by the Parish Courts, but are referred to the Supreme Court after a preliminary hearing. The Parish Courts also have a number of divisions, including the Family Court, Coroners Court, Tax Court, Juvenile Court, Traffic Court, Small Claims Court, Night Court, Drug Court, and Gun Court (Parish Court Division). Resident Magistrates or Parish Court are appointed by the Governor General on recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission. They are assigned to a parish by the Chief Justice and report to the Chief Justice. The minimum qualification for the Resident Magistrate is five (5) years at the Bar. Petty Sessions The Petty Sessions hear minor criminal matters, such as resisting arrest. Justices of the Peace serve as judges in the Petty Sessions. Caribbean Court of Justice In 2001 Jamaica signed the agreement establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice. The Court has a dual role: it has original jurisdiction and functions as an international court in interpreting and applying the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which established CARICOM; and it is intended to replace the Privy Council as a court of last appeal for the countries of the Commonwealth Caribbean. In 2004 the Jamaican Parliament approved the establishment of the CCJ as the highest court in its Original Jurisdiction in the interpretation of the Revised Treaty of Chagaramus, while at the same time attempting to replace Privy Council as the final appellate court in Jamaica. However, in 2005 the Privy Council struck down the change to the final appellate court as unconstitutional because the Privy Council's status is an entrenched provision in the Jamaican Constitution and as such more would be required to remove the Privy Council as the final appellate court. The Council ruled that although Parliament was within its powers to remove appellate jurisdiction from the Privy Council, it could not grant jurisdiction to the CCJ through an ordinary act. Instead, such a change must meet the more rigorous standards for amending \\"entrenched\\" provisions of the Jamaican Constitution. As a result, the Privy Council remains the final court of appeal for Jamaica. As of June 2015, three bills which would abolish appeals to the Privy Council and make the CCJ Jamaica's final court of appeal have passed the House of Representatives and have been sent to the Senate where they must be approved by a two-thirds majority to become law.

The Air Defense Artillery is the branch that specializes in anti-aircraft weapons (such as surface-to-air missiles). In the US Army, these groups are composed of mainly air defense systems such as the PATRIOT Missile System, Terminal High Altitude Air Defense, and the Avenger Air Defense system which fires the FIM-92 Stinger missile. The Air Defense Artillery branch descended from the Anti-Aircraft Artillery (part of the Field Artillery) into a separate branch on 20 June 1968.  History  During World War II, US Army anti-aircraft systems were quite competent. Their smaller tactical needs were filled with four M2 (.50 BMG.50 caliber) machine guns linked together (known as the \\"Quad Fifty\\"), which were often mounted on the back of a half-track to form the Half Track, M16 GMC, Anti-Aircraft. Although of even less power than Germany's 20 mm systems, they were at least widely available. They were also used to help suppress ground targets. Their larger 90 mm M2 gun would prove, as did the eighty-eight, to make an excellent anti-tank gun as well, and was widely used late in the war in this role. Also available to the Americans at the start of the war was the 120 mm M1 gun stratosphere gun, which was the most powerful AA gun with an impressive 60,000 ft (~18 km) altitude capability. The 90 mm and 120 mm guns would continue to be used into the 1950s. = Self-propelled anti- aircraft weapons = During the course of the Korean War, the U.S. Army decided to phase out all vehicles based on the M24 Chaffee chassis, such as the M19 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage with 2x 40mm Anti-Aircraft guns, in favor of designs that utilized the chassis of the M41. Since the 40mm guns were still seen as an effective anti-aircraft weapon, they became the basis of the Duster. The first effective self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon (SPAAG) in U.S. Army service was the all-manual M42 Duster. While relatively capable for the era it was designed in, by the time it reached widespread service in the late 1950s it was clear that it was ineffective against high-speed jet-powered targets. The Duster was completely removed from service by 1963, only to be re-introduced briefly during the Vietnam War when its replacement never arrived. The first proposed replacement for the Duster was the Sperry Vigilante, which referred to the six-barreled 37 mm Gatling gun proposed as the basis for a new SPAAG. Although the gun was extremely powerful, at some point in the late 1950s the Army decided that all gun-based systems were out of date. The next proposed replacement for the Duster was the ambitious MIM-46 Mauler. Mauler mounted a nine-missile magazine on top of an adapted M113 Armored Personnel Carrier chassis, along with detection and tracking radars. Mauler featured a completely automatic fire control system, with the operators simply selecting targets and pressing \\"OK\\". It would be able to respond to low-flying high-speed targets at any angle out to a range of about five miles. However, Mauler proved to be beyond the state-of-the-art and ran into intractable problems during development. Realizing it was not going to enter service any time soon, it was downgraded to a technology demonstration program in 1963, and eventually cancelled outright in 1965.Andreas Parsch, \\"General Dynamics MIM-46 Mauler\\", 2002 Still lacking an effective anti-aircraft system, the Army started development of two stop-gap systems that were meant to operate in concert. The M163 VADS combined the M61 Vulcan cannon, the M113 chassis, and an all-optical fire control system with a simple lead-computing gunsight. Suitable for \\"snap shots\\" against nearby targets, the VADS system was equipped only with a small ranging radar for the gunsight, its firing range being too small to justify a larger tracking radar. VADS was intended to operate in concert with the MIM-72 Chaparral, which combined the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile with a modified version of the M548 Cargo Carrier chassis. The Chaparral's AIM-9D missiles were capable of tail-chase launches only, but offered ranges up to 5 miles. Also using an all-optical firing system, the Chaparral nevertheless required the operator to \\"settle\\" the missiles on the target for a period of time to allow them to lock on, limiting its ability to deal with quickly moving targets. Both vehicles were optionally supported by the AN/MPQ-49 Forward Area Alerting Radar (FAAR), but this system was towed by the Gama Goat and couldn't be used near the front lines.Andreas Parsch, \\"Ford MIM-72 Chaparral\\", 2002 The pair of weapons was, at best, a nuisance to the enemy and had limited performance against modern aircraft. Eventually the M48 and M163 were both replaced in US service by the M1097 Avenger and the M6 Linebacker (M2 Bradley with FIM-92 Stinger missiles instead of the standard TOW anti-tank missiles). At one point the Army started to become concerned about developments in sensor technologies that would allow attacks by fixed- wing aircraft at night or in bad weather. They developed a requirement for a weapon system able to operate using FLIR and a laser rangefinder in order to counter these threats. However, the rest of the military establishment pooh- poohed the idea; even the US Air Force carried out only limited operations in bad weather, and the Soviets had a considerably less capable force in this regard. The idea gained little traction and died.Irene Willhite, \\"40-mm DIVISION AIR DEFENSE GUN: DIVAD (Sgt. York)\\", Cold War Times, March 2002, pp. 15‚Äì22 = Pop-up problems = During the late 1960s the combination of helicopter and anti-tank missiles improved to the point where they became a major threat to armored operations. The U.S. led the field with their TOW missile on the Cobra gunship, demonstrating this powerful combination in combat in 1972's Easter Offensive. The Soviets initially lagged the U.S., but the introduction of the 9K114 Shturm (known in the west as the AT-6 \\"Spiral\\") missile on the Mi-24 \\"Hind\\" in the mid-1970s offered the USSR a level of superiority. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, attack helicopters had the ability to loiter near the front behind cover and pick their targets. They would then \\"pop up\\", launch a missile, and return to cover as soon as the missile hit its target. Using fast-reacting wire-guided or radio-command missiles meant the total engagement time was kept to a minimum, as there was little or no \\"lock- on\\" time required; the operator simply picked his target, fired, and adjusted its flight path while it flew. Against these targets, the Vulcan/Chaparral combination was effectively useless. The Vulcan could react quickly enough to the fleeting targets, but its 20 mm gun had an effective range of only about 1,200 meters, far shorter than the 3,000 to 5,000 meters range of the \\"Spiral\\". While the Chaparral had enough range to engage the \\"Hind\\", its lengthy lock-on period meant they would have hit their target and hidden behind terrain again before the Sidewinder would reach it. Additionally, the older Sidewinder missiles used on Chaparral required hot targets, and had very limited capability against helicopters. The limited effectiveness of the Vulcan/Chaparral was not the only problem the US Army was facing in the late 1970s. At the time, they were also in the process of introducing the new M1 Abrams and M2 Bradley vehicles, which had dramatically improved cross-country performance. The M113-based Vulcan and Chaparral could not keep up with them on the advance, and would leave them open to attack in a fast moving front.Statements by General Louis Wagner, Jr., DIVAD Hearings, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Tactical Warfare of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 98th Congress, 2nd Session, 1984 = Sergeant York DIVAD = For all of these reasons, the Army developed the \\"Advanced Radar-directed Gun Air Defense System\\" (ARGADS) requirement for a new weapon system with the speed of the Vulcan and range of the Chaparral, intending to replace them both with a chassis that could keep up with the new tanks in combat. They also worked in the original FLIR/laser requirement. The system was later renamed \\"Division Air Defense\\" (DIVAD).Asher Sharoni and Lawrence Bacon, \\"Forward Area Air- Ground Defense\\", Armor, US Army Armor Center, Fort Knox, July‚ÄìAugust 1996, pp 15‚Äì20 At the time, most U.S. military policy was based on the US Air Force quickly gaining air superiority and holding it throughout a conflict. In keeping with this, the Army had previously placed relatively low priority on anti-aircraft weapons. This gave them time to mature through testing and shakedowns. In the case of DIVADs the threat was considered so serious and rapidly developing that the Army decided to skip the traditional development period and try to go straight into production by using a number of \\"off-the- shelf\\" parts. Colonel Russell Parker testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 1977 that \\"We expect this somewhat unorthodox approach to permit a much reduced development time, thus resulting in an earliest fielding date, albeit with higher but acceptable risks... the manufacturer will be required by the fixed price warranty provisions, to correct deficiencies.\\"John Adam, \\"The Sergeant York Gun: A Massive Misfire\\", IEEE Spectrum, February 1987 It was claimed that this would cut up to five years from the development cycle, although it would require problems to be found and fixed on the operational vehicles. This system became the M247 Sergeant York DIVAD (Division Air Defense), a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon developed by Ford Aerospace in the late 1970s which featured twin radar-directed 40 mm rapid-fire guns. Operational test and evaluation (OT&E;) of the M247 T&E; concluded that the system's gun could perform the mission as originally specified, but tests also showed that the system had considerable reliability problems, many as the result of trying to adapt a radar system developed for aircraft to the ground role. Subsequent production tests 5 turned up a continued variety of problems, failing 22 of 163 contract requirements, and 22 serious failures in operational readiness. The M247 OT&E; Director, Jack Krings, stated the tests showed, \\"...the SGT YORK was not operationally effective in adequately protecting friendly forces during simulated combat, even though its inherent capabilities provided improvement over the current [General Electric] Vulcan gun system. The SGT YORK was not operationally suitable because of its low availability during the tests.\\" On 27 August 1985, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger halted the M247 project after about 50 vehicles had been produced. = HAWK medium range SAM = A HAWK system in service with the German Luftwaffe before it was phased out The Raytheon MIM-23 HAWK is an American medium range surface-to-air missile. As a backronym, some consider HAWK to stand for Homing All the Way Killer or Home And Weekend Killer. The HAWK was initially designed to destroy aircraft and was later adapted to destroy other missiles in flight. The missile entered service in 1960, and a program of extensive upgrades has kept it from becoming obsolete. It was superseded by the MIM-104 Patriot in United States Army service by 1994. It was finally phased out of US service in 2002, the last users, the US Marine Corps replacing it with the man-portable ir-guided visual range FIM-92 Stinger. The missile was also produced outside the US in Western Europe and Japan. Although the United States never used the Hawk in a combat situation, it has been employed numerous times by foreign nations. Approximately 40,000 of the missiles were produced.  Current air defense  Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) is a category of anti-aircraft weapons and tactics that have to do with defense against low-altitude air threats, primarily helicopters and low-flying close air support aircraft such as the A-10, Su-25 or MiG-27. SHORAD and it's complements, HIMAD (High to Medium Air Defense) and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) divide air defense of the battlespace into domes of responsibility based on altitude and defensive weapon ranges. SHORAD teams are attached as organic air defense assets at the battalion or brigade level. US SHORAD teams are based around the FIM-92 Stinger missile and its mounted platforms, the M1097 Avenger and M6 Linebacker. Airborne and Air Assault units primarily employ MANPADS teams for SHORAD; armored units rely on the Linebacker and Bradley Stinger Fighting Vehicle. However, post-2006, there were no Linebacker units left in service, as all vehicles had been converted back to the Bradley ODS standard. = Stinger = The FIM-92 Stinger is a personal portable infrared homing surface- to-air missile developed in the United States and entered into service in 1981. Used by the militaries of the U.S. and by 29 other countries, the basic Stinger missile has to-date been responsible for 270 confirmed aircraft kills. It is manufactured by Raytheon Missile Systems and under license by EADS in Germany, with 70,000 missiles produced. It is classified as a Man-Portable Air-Defense System (MANPADS). Initial work on the missile was begun by General Dynamics in 1967 as the Redeye II. It was accepted for further development by the U.S. Army in 1971 and designated FIM-92; the Stinger appellation was chosen in 1972. Because of technical difficulties that dogged testing, the first shoulder launch was not until mid-1975. Production of the FIM-92A began in 1978 to replace the FIM-43 Redeye. Light to carry and relatively easy to operate, the FIM-92 Stinger is a passive surface-to-air missile, shoulder- fired by a single operator, although officially it requires two. The FIM-92B can attack aircraft at a range of up to 15,700 feet (4,800 m) and at altitudes between 600 and 12,500 feet (180 and 3,800 m). The missile can also be fired from the M-1097 Avenger vehicle and the M6 Linebacker, an air defense variant of the M2 Bradley IFV. The missile is also capable of being deployed from Humvee Stinger rack, and can be used by airborne paratroopers. A helicopter launched version exists called the ATAS or Air-to-Air Stinger. = Short range radar = The AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel is a three-dimensional radar used to alert and queue Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) weapons to the locations of hostile targets approaching their front line forces. The Sentinel radar is deployed with forward area air defense units of the U.S. Army and USMC. The radar uses an X-band range-gated, pulse-doppler system. The antenna uses phase-frequency electronic scanning technology, forming sharp 3D pencil beams covering large surveillance and track volume. The radar automatically acquires, tracks, classifies, identifies and reports targets, including cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. It uses a high scan rate (30 RPM) and operates at a range of 40 km. The radar is designed with high resistance to electronic countermeasures (ECM). Mounted on a towed platform, it can be positioned remotely from the rest of the unit, operated autonomously and communicate with the Fire Distribution Center (FDC) via wideband fiber-optic link. It can also distribute its data over a SINCGARS radio network. = Patriot = The MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary of its kind used by the United States Army and several allied nations. On 15 October 1964 the Secretary of Defense directed that the Army Air Defense System for the 1970s (AADS-70s) program name be changed to Surface-to-Air Missile, Development (SAM-D). In 1975 the SAM-D missile successfully engaged a drone at the White Sands Missile Range. In 1976, it was renamed the PATRIOT Air Defense Missile System. The MIM-104 Patriot would combine several new technologies, including the phased array radar and track-via-missile guidance. Full-scale development of the system began in 1976 and it was deployed in 1984. Patriot was used initially as an anti-aircraft system, but in 1988 it was upgraded to provide limited capability against tactical ballistic missiles (TBM) as PAC-1 (Patriot Advanced Capability-1). It is manufactured by the Raytheon Company of the United States. The Patriot System replaced the Nike Hercules system as the U.S. Army's primary High to Medium Air Defense (HIMAD) platform, and replaced the MIM-23 Hawk system as the U.S. Army's medium tactical air defense platform. In addition to these roles, Patriot has assumed the role as the U.S. Army's anti-ballistic missile (ABM) platform, which today is Patriot's primary mission.

Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868, and seven had the same number of storms. Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a re-analysis confirmed the activity. All tropical activity occurred within a 45‚Äëday span. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines. Only one of the storms, the second, made landfall, doing so near Apalachicola, Florida. It produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds across the southeastern United States, although there was no severe damage associated with the storm. The first hurricane killed two people when a ship passed through its winds for 14 hours. The third hurricane, located in the western Caribbean Sea, did not affect land, although two ships experienced its strong winds. The final hurricane lasted three days across the western Atlantic, forcing one ship to halt its voyage due to storm damage. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/09/1868 till:01/11/1868 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/09/1868 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:03/09/1868 till:07/09/1868 color:C2 text:\\"One (C2)\\" from:01/10/1868 till:06/10/1868 color:TS text:\\"Two (TS)\\" from:05/10/1868 till:07/10/1868 color:C2 text:\\"Three (C2)\\" from:15/10/1868 till:17/10/1868 color:C2 text:\\"Four (C2)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/09/1868 till:01/10/1868 text:September from:01/10/1868 till:01/11/1868 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Systems =Hurricane One= The first known tropical cyclone of the season was observed on September 3, about halfway between the Bahamas and Bermuda. A nearby ship estimated winds of 80 mph (130 km), indicating the presence of the hurricane. It moved northward initially, passing about 220 mi (355 km) west of Bermuda on September 4\\\\. Thereafter, the hurricane turned toward the northeast, and the ship \\"John Richardson\\" encountered gale force winds on September 5, resulting in a wreck of its cargo. On September 6, it was estimated to have reached peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), based on observations from the ship with the call sign \\"Greenock\\". The hurricane lashed the ship with strong winds for 14 hours, killing the captain and one crewman. At the time, it was about 400 mi (640 km) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Turning to the northeast, the hurricane passed south of Newfoundland before last being observed on September 7\\\\. =Tropical Storm Two= A ship sunk in the western Gulf of Mexico on October 1, which was the first indication of the second tropical cyclone of the season. The storm moved slowly northeastward toward the southeastern Louisiana coastline, intensifying to its estimated peak winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). On October 4, it passed near or over southeastern Louisiana, producing heavy rain and gusty winds in New Orleans. Flooding was observed in portions of the city, and the West Rigolets Lighthouse on Lake Pontchartrain suffered $5,000 in damage due to the storm (1868 USD, $81,000 2010 USD). The storm accelerated northeastward and struck near Apalachicola, Florida late on October 4\\\\. As the storm crossed over the Florida panhandle and southeastern Georgia, the winds weakened to , although it still produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds in Savannah, Georgia. No severe damage was reported in the city. The tropical storm continued northeastward, emerging into the western Atlantic and paralleling the coastlines of the Carolinas just offshore. Several ships reported strong winds and rough seas. On October 6, the storm restrengthened to its peak intensity before becoming an extratropical cyclone about 200 mi (320 km) southeast of Cape Cod; however, one meteorologist assessed it as acquiring extratropical characteristics after it exited Georgia into the western Atlantic. As an extratropical storm, it reached winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), based on a ship report south of Atlantic Canada. Late on October 7, the storm was last observed to the south of Newfoundland. The storm was the only one in the season not to attain hurricane status. =Hurricane Three= As the previous storm was moving along the coastline of the southeastern United States, a new hurricane was observed in the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105 mph (165 km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west- northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October 7\\\\. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown. =Hurricane Four= The final known hurricane of the season was observed on October 15, to the northeast of the central Bahamas. The ship \\"Jim Cow\\", en route from New York to Panama, suffered heavy damage from the storm, so much that it could not complete its voyage. Moving generally northeastward, the hurricane was estimated to have reached peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), based on ship reports. On October 17 the cyclone was absorbed by a rapidly intensifying extratropical cyclone off the coast of New England. It never affected land.

It was built in the late 14th century at the site of the current Christiansborg Palace. Copenhagen Castle seen on illustration from Peder Hansen Resen's Atlas Danica History In 1167, Bishop Absalon (c. 1128‚Äì1201) founded a fortress on the islet of Slotsholmen in the harbour of Copenhagen. It consisted of a courtyard with several buildings and surrounded by a wall for protection. During the years after the demolition of Bishop Absalon's Castle by the Hansa League in 1369, the ruins on the island were covered with earthworks, on which the new stronghold, Copenhagen Castle, was built. In 1343 King Valdemar Atterdag took over Absalon's castle, but upon his death in 1375 the right to the property returned to the Diocese of Roskilde. The castle had a curtain wall and was surrounded by a moat which had an inner diameter of about 50 meters and with a large, solid tower as an entrance gate. The castle was still the property of the Bishop of Roskilde until King Eric of Pomerania usurped the rights to the castle in 1417. The Hanseatic League attacked the castle and in the Bombardment of Copenhagen during the Dano-Hanseatic War (1426‚Äì1435). The attack was fought back by in 1428 by Queen Philippa, who led the defense from Copenhagen Castle. From the middle of the 15th century, the castle served as the Danish monarch's main residence and center of government. The castle was expanded and rebuilt several times. King Christian IV, added a spire to the large entrance tower, which under the name of the Blue Tower gained a reputation as a prison. In the 1720s, King Frederik IV entirely rebuilt the castle, but it became so heavy that the walls began to give way and to crack. It became therefore evident to King Christian VI, Frederik IV's successor, immediately after his accession to the throne in 1730, that an entirely new castle had to be built. The demolition of the overextended and antiquated Copenhagen Castle was commenced in 1731 to make room for the first Christiansborg Palace.

Football career Boyes was born in Southampton and on leaving school was a member of the Hampshire County Cricket Club's ground staff at the County Ground, Southampton. In 1914, he was taken on by Southampton Football Club as an amateur, but failed to reach the first team before the outbreak of war. During the war, he represented his battalion at both cricket and football, and was also the regimental sprinting champion. At the end of the war, he returned to the \\"Saints\\" and was signed as a professional in October 1919. He made his first team debut, in a Southern League fixture at Reading, when he took the place of inside-left Jimmy Moore for two matches. In January, he made a further two appearances, this time at outside-left as a replacement for Fred Foxall. In 1920 Southampton, along with most Southern League clubs, joined the new Football League Third Division, but Boyes was unable to get into the team past Moore and Foxall who were both ever-present as Saints finished their inaugural season in the Football League second in the table, missing out on the only available promotion place. Boyes eventually made his Football League debut as replacement for Foxall against Norwich City on 15 October 1921, followed by three games in April, this time replacing Henry Johnson. In June 1922, Boyes was given a free transfer to Bristol Rovers where he made two first-team appearances before returning to the south coast, joining Poole for their first season in the Western League, followed by a season with Weymouth.

Schultz became world-famous for the development of a system of self-hypnosis called autogenic training.  Life  He studied medicine in Lausanne, G√∂ttingen (where he met Karl Jaspers) and Breslau. He earned his doctorate from G√∂ttingen in 1907. After receiving his medical license in 1908, he practiced at the polyclinic at the Medical University Clinic at G√∂ttingen until 1911. Afterwards he worked at the Paul- Ehrlich Institute in Frankfurt, at the insane asylum at Chemnitz and finally at the Psychiatric University Clinic at Jena under Otto Binswanger, where he earned his habilitation in 1915. During the First World War, he served as director of a sanitorium in Belgium. In 1919 he became a professor of Psychiatry and Neuropathology at Jena. In 1920 he became Chief Doctor and scientific leader at Dr. Heinrich Lahmann's sanatorium Weisser Hirsch in Dresden. In 1924, he established himself as a psychiatrist in Berlin. From 1925-26 he was a member of the founding committee for the first General Doctors' Congress for Psychotherapy, board member of the General Medical Society for Psychotherapy (established in 1927). From 1928 he advised the organization's newsletter, and after 1930 he co-edited (with Arthur Kronfeld and Rudolf Allers) the journal, now named the Zentralblatt f√ºr Psychotherapie.Geschichte der Psychotherapie in Deutschland im 20. Jahrhundert: Die Allgemeine √Ñrztliche Zeitschrift f√ºr Psychotherapie und psychische Hygiene In 1933 he became a board member of the renamed German Medical Society for Psychotherapy under Matthias Heinrich G√∂ring and from 1936 under this vice-director a board member of the German Institute for Psychological Research and Psychotherapy (Deutsches Institut f√ºr psychologische Forschung und Psychotherapie) as well as director of the polyclinic. Nazi Period In 1933 he began research on his guidebook on sexual education, Geschlecht, Liebe, Ehe, in which he focused on homosexuality and explored the topics of sterilization and euthanasia. In 1935 he published an essay titled Psychological consequences of sterilization and castration among men, which supported compulsory sterilization of men in order to eliminate hereditary illnesses. Soon after he was appointed deputy director of the G√∂ring Institute in Berlin, which was the headquarters of the Deutsches Institut f√ºr psychologische Forschung und Psychotherapie (German institute for psychological research and psychotherapy). Through this institute, he had an active role in the extermination of mentally handicapped individuals in the framework of the Aktion T4 program.Geoffrey Cocks: La psychoth√©rapie sous le IIIe Reich. L'Institut G√∂ring, Ed.: Belles Lettres, 1987, Coll.: Confluents psychanalytiques, . There he began to test many of his theories on homosexuality. Schultz strongly believed that homosexuality generally was not hereditary and that most homosexuals became so through perversion. He stated on numerous occasions that homosexuals displayed \\"scrubby and stunted forms of personality development\\". Consequently, he also believed that homosexuality was curable through intense psychotherapy. During his time at the G√∂ring Institute, 510 homosexuals were recorded to have received numerous psychotherapeutic treatments and 341 were deemed to be cured by the end of the treatments. Most of his subjects were convicted homosexuals brought in from concentration camps. After treating his patients, Schultz tested the treatments' effectiveness by forcing them to have sex with prostitutes. In a case study he later released, in which he briefly discussed the process of determining whether a young SS soldier, who had been sentenced to death for homosexual acts, was 'cured', Schultz stated: \\"Those who were considered incurable were sent back to the concentration camps, but 'cured' homosexuals, such as the previously mentioned SS soldier, were pardoned and released into military service\\". In this way Schultz actually saved numerous accused homosexuals from the hellish life of a concentration camp but he stated later that \\"successfully treated subjects were sent to the front, where they most probably were killed in action\\". After the war, the G√∂ring Institute was disbanded but Schultz faced no repercussions for his more dubious research and methods during the past decade. In fact he released a case study on his work with homosexuals in 1952 titled Organst√∂rungen und Perversionen im Liebesleben, in which he admitted to the inhumanity of some of his experiments but also still supported their results. In fact he continued to support his findings and even continued to advocate paragraph 175 for the rest of his life.https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-102609-144251/unrestricted/PsychologyUndertheThirdReich.pdf In 1956, he became editor of the journal Psychotherapie, and in 1959 founder of the German Society for Medical Hypnosis (Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr √§rztliche Hypnose). Autogenic training Schultz's most famous achievement was the development of autogenic training, that was based on the hypnosis research and self-experimentation. It was first publicly put forward in 1926 as \\"autogenic organ exercises\\", and received its current name in 1928. The program consists of a set of six mental exercises that target specific bodily reactions that are believed to underpin body-mind health. It is a myth that autogenic training is a technique based on creative visualisations. Rather, it is a technique that revolves around a set of sub-vocal instructions to different parts of the body with the trainee simply observing in a completely non-striving way the changes in the way the body feels. It is a passive process, unlike creative visualisations, which rely upon a more active cognitive state. Today, because of Schultz' contribution to body-mind health, autogenic training is practiced worldwide. NASA teaches AT to their astronauts to help them with the psychophysiological stressors of space travel. In Australia, UK, Italy and Spain AT is taught to assist with problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, anger management, insomnia, fatigue and for difficulties with concentration, memory, decision making amongst other things. In Japan and Germany, medical practices teach AT to assist with the treatment of a wide range of medical complaints. The Autogenic Training Institute of Australia teaches AT for occupational health and safety and has become well known for its work with the mining, oil and gas industry as well as police.

The Levies were drawn from all parts of the Protectorate and were armed and officered by the British military. They used the Lahej emblem of crossed jambiyah (traditional curved double-edged dagger) as their badge. History =Foundation= The APL were formed on 1 April 1928 primarily to protect Royal Air Force stations following the change of status of Aden to an Air Command in April 1927. Their secondary role was to be that of assisting the civil police. The APL also organized a camel troop. Prior to 1928 the British garrison in Aden had comprised one British and one Indian infantry battalion, plus Royal Artillery units and detachments of sappers and miners. A locally recruited infantry unit, known as the 1st Yemen Infantry, had been raised in the Aden Protectorate during 1917-18 for service in World War I but had been disbanded in 1925. =Organisation= Colonel M.C. Lake of the British Indian Army was the first Commanding Officer until Lt. Col. J.C. (Robby) Robinson took over command in 1929 and remained as C.O. till 1939. In 1928 the APL comprised two British officers and six platoons of Arabs recruited from the various tribes that lived in the foothills or the higher mountainous regions of the protectorate. Each platoon comprised one officer and 34 non-commissioned officers and men, as well as 48 camels and 8 mules to carry them, their supplies, and equipment. During the early years of the APL's existence a number of junior commissioned officers and senior NCOs were Indian. The APL Depot Battalion, the Levies' base and training organisation, was based in Aden Colony. The Depot included married quarters, a neonatal clinic, a school for children, the APL Band, and the APL Camel Troop. Air supply and other repair and supply units also were based there. The APL Hospital (ALH), located near Khormaksar, was a 160-bed RAF general hospital that provided free medical care to the APL's 1,500 men active members and their families, and also to former members, about 10,000 people in all. The ALH also provided the medicines to the APL. The hospital CO was an RAF doctor; two RAF warrant officers and an administration and supplies staff assisted him. Three RAF doctors and a surgeon, assisted by local doctors, provided medical coverage. The other RAF personnel were two male nurses, two laboratory technicians and a pharmacist. Local people made up the rest of the staff and all of them would have been trained on site. =Arab officers= Arab officers were called Bimbashis, with one in each battalion being responsible to the Commanding Officer for Arab Administration. They held Governor's Commissions as 2nd lieutenant (MulazimIth Thani); lieutenant (Mulazim Al Awal); captain (Rais); and major (Wakil Qaid Ith Thani). During the period of RAF control prior to 1957, a different system of Arab rank designations had been in place at all levels. The senior Arab rank was that of lieutenant colonel (Qaid Al Awal). =World War II= During World War II the APL was expanded from 600 to 1,600 men. The Levies operated in Aden and the Western Aden Protectorate but also provided garrisons at Socotra Island and Sharjah. By 1939 an APL anti-aircraft wing had been created, which shot down an Italian plane in the course of the war. In 1942 a six-year process of replacing British Army personnel serving with the APL with RAF Regiment officers and airmen commenced. This policy led to the reorganisation of the Levies into a tactical force of two wings, each about the equivalent of a battalion, plus an administrative wing. A third infantry wing was added after 1948 =Postwar= During the December 1947 anti-Jewish riots in Aden City, some Arab personnel of the Levies proved ineffective in controlling inter-communal violence and fired indiscriminately into Jewish houses, killing several of the inhabitants.British Government report on the 1947 riots, quoted in: The Levies reverted to War Office control in 1957 with British Army officers and NCOs replacing RAF secondees. The AFL headquarters was at Seedaseer Lines in Khormaksar. \\"Up country\\" forward bases and garrisons were maintained at Dhala, Mukalla, Seiyun, Beihan, Zinjibar, Ataq. Lawdar and Mukeiras. In 1958 the APL, supported by British troops and the RAF, repulsed border intrusions by Yemeni forces in the Jebel Jihaf region. Border clashes with North Yemeni tribal groups continued through the late 1950s. By 1961 the APL consisted of four rifle battalions, each of which had 82mm Mortars, medium machine guns and signallers, and a Mechanical Transport Platoon. A fifth rifle battalion was raised in 1964, after the Levies had become the Federal Regular Army. The APL was a brigade-equivalent force with its own air supply and air liaison officers and a Senior Arab Officer. Additional units included the APL Armoured Car Squadron, the APL Signal Squadron, the APL Band and the APL Camel Troop. The APL Camel Troop was a ceremonial unit. On 30 November 1961, following the creation of the South Arabian Federation, the APL changed its name to the Federal Regular Army. After 1967, most of the troops and many native officers of the Levies joined the newly formed South Yemeni Army, or People's Democratic Republic of Yemen Armed Forces. The new Army consisted of a merging of the existing units of the APL with the 7,000 troops and units of the Marxist National Liberation Front guerilla organisation that had spearheaded the anti-British insurgency and independence movement. Those British trained personnel considered politically unreliable were purged from the reorganised armed forces of the newly established People's Republic of Yemen. Awards Officers and other ranks of the Levies were awarded the following: * One Distinguished Service Order (D.S.O.) * Seven Military Crosses (M.C.) * Two Military Medals (M.M.) * One Officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.) * Three Member of the Order of the British Empires (M.B.E) * One British Empire Medal (B.E.M.) Insignia and uniforms The badge of the APL, worn in various designs from the 1940s on, included crossed jambiyas (double-edged Adeni daggers) under a crescent and star, with the motto \\"Peace be with you\\" in Arabic. Throughout its history the APL wore the khaki drill uniform of the British Indian Army, complete with a Punjabi style pagri (turban). When on service in the \\"up-country\\" hinterland of the Protectorate, a simple khaki head-roll or mashedda was adopted by all ranks, modeled on that of the Audhali tribe from whom many of the Levies were recruited. A white ceremonial uniform with green turban and waist-sash was worn by both the Camel Troop and the Guard of Honour.

The first auto to be donated to the California Automobile Museum was a restored 1938 Buick sedan, a gift from John Joyce, president of the Golden One Credit Union, which is still on display at the museum. In 1997, the museum was renamed the Towe Auto Museum, as they began displaying vehicles of all makes and models. In 2009, the Board of Directors officially changed the name of the museum to the California Automobile Museum, reflecting the expanded mission it has grown into over the last 25 years. Exhibits and attractions Most of the 150 vehicles currently on display are on loan from private exhibitors. The cars on display represent a cross-section of cars driven in California over the last 120 years. Approximately 40% of the vehicles are owned by the California Vehicle Foundation. The rest are on loan from private exhibitors, and display terms vary from vehicle to vehicle, so the display is a constantly changing exhibit of rolling stock to better tell the story of the development of the automobile and its effect on our lives.

M. Reddy and produced by Ardeshir Irani. It is notable for being the first sound film in the Tamil and Telugu languages, and the first sound film to be made in a language from South India. It was based on the life of the Sanskrit poet KƒÅlidƒÅsa; it featured P. G. Venkatesan in the title role and T. P. Rajalakshmi as the female lead, with L. V. Prasad, Thevaram Rajambal, T. Susheela Devi, J. Sushila, and M. S. Santhanalakshmi in supporting roles. Kalidas, principally in Tamil, contained additional dialogue in Telugu and Hindi. While Rajalakshmi spoke Tamil, Venkatesan spoke only Telugu due to his lack of fluency in Tamil, and Prasad spoke only Hindi. Despite its mythological theme, the film featured songs from much later time periods, such as the compositions of Carnatic musician Tyagaraja, publicity songs of the Indian National Congress, and songs about Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement. The sound was recorded using German-made technology. Kalidas was shot in Bombay on the sets of India's first sound film Alam Ara (1931) and was completed in eight days. Kalidas was released with high expectations on 31 October 1931, coinciding with Diwali day. It was the only South Indian film to be produced and released that year. Despite numerous technical flaws, it received critical acclaim, with praise for Rajalakshmi's singing performance, and became a major commercial success. The success of Kalidas spawned other films based upon KƒÅlidƒÅsa, including Mahakavi Kalidasa (1955), Mahakavi Kalidasu (1960) and Mahakavi Kalidas (1966). In addition to its commercial success, Kalidas was a major breakthrough for Rajalakshmi's career, and made her a bankable singing star. Because no print, gramophone record, or songbook of the film is known to survive, it is a lost film.  Plot  Vidhyadhari is the daughter of Vijayavarman, the king of Thejavathi. His minister wants the princess to marry his son but she refuses. Annoyed, the minister sets out to find another potential husband for Vidhyadhari. In the forest, the minister finds an illiterate cowman sitting on a tree and cutting into the branch on which he is sitting. The minister persuades the cowman to come to the palace and has Vidhyadhari marry him. When Vidhyadhari realises she has been cheated, and is married to a farmhand, she prays to the goddess Kali for a remedy. Kali appears before her, names her husband Kalidas and endows him with phenomenal literary talents.  Cast  * T. P. Rajalakshmi as Vidhyadhari * P. G. Venkatesan as Kalidas * L. V. Prasad as the temple priest Other supporting roles were played by Thevaram Rajambal, T. Susheela Devi, J. Sushila and M. S. Santhanalakshmi.  Production  After the success of India's first sound film Alam Ara (1931), its director Ardeshir Irani wanted to venture into South Indian cinema. In the same year, he chose H. M. Reddy, his former assistant, to direct the first South Indian sound film, which would later become the first Tamil-Telugu film Kalidas, based on the life of the Sanskrit poet and playwright KƒÅlidƒÅsa. Irani produced the film under Imperial Movi-Tone. P. G. Venkatesan was chosen to play the title role. L. V. Prasad‚Äîwho later founded Prasad Studios‚Äîappeared in a comic role as a temple priest. Theatre artiste T. P. Rajalakshmi was chosen to play the female protagonist; according to film historian Randor Guy, she was the \\"automatic choice to play the heroine.\\" Before this, Rajalakshmi had acted in many silent films, and Kalidas was her first sound film. Supporting roles were played by Thevaram Rajambal, T. Susheela Devi, J. Sushila, and M. S. Santhanalakshmi. The sound was recorded by German technicians using German-made equipment. Kalidas was shot in Bombay (now Mumbai) on the sets of Alam Ara; it was completed in eight days, using either or of film, as sources differ. Film historian Film News Anandan stated that Kalidas \\"was produced in a hurry, and was technically flawed.\\" While Kalidas primary language was Tamil, the film's actors spoke a variety of languages, including Tamil (Rajalakshmi), Telugu (Venkatesan) and Hindi (Prasad). Because Venkatesan's first language was Telugu, and he could not correctly pronounce Tamil words, his dialogue was in Telugu. According to Guy, Irani was initially unsure if the German sound recording equipment would record the Tamil language; to assuage his doubts, he had some actors speak and sing in Tamil, with Venkatesan in Telugu. Because the equipment had already been used to record Hindi, he had other actors speak that language; the equipment recorded each language clearly. Owing to the use of multiple languages, sources including Film News Anandan, Birgit Meyer, and Guy have refused to call Kalidas the first Tamil sound film; Guy instead called it India's first multilingual film. In the 2010 book Cinemas of South India: Culture, Resistance, Ideology, Sowmya Dechamma states that Telugu dialogues were included in the film, apparently to \\"increase its market potential in the two important language markets of southern India.\\"  Music  Kalidas featured fifty songs composed and written by Bhaskara Das. Film historian S. Theodore Baskaran mentions in his 1996 book, The Eye of the Serpent: An Introduction to Tamil Cinema, that all of the songs were in Tamil. Birgit Meyer contradicted Baskaran in her 2009 book Aesthetic Formations, stating that the film had Telugu songs, a view that was supported by Sowmya Dechamma in Cinemas of South India: Culture, Resistance, Ideology. Although the film was based on mythology, it featured compositions from much later time periods, such as those by the Carnatic musician Tyagaraja, and Indian National Congress publicity songs. Film News Anandan stated Reddy was \\"probably pleased to add on anything artistic that came his way. Relevance was hardly an issue.\\" The 2008 book Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry by Selvaraj Velayutham and Aesthetic Formations by Birgit Meyer stipulate that the nationalistic songs featured in the film had nothing to do with the main plot, while Randor Guy states during that period, \\"Historical accuracy wasn't as important as the music. It wasn't uncommon for the deities to sing modern poems or nationalist songs.\\" Baskaran noted that this marked the \\"beginning of cinema being used as an instrument of political propaganda.\\" The patriotic song \\"Gandhiyin Kai Rattiname\\" (\\"The Charkha that [Mahatma] Gandhi handles\\"), also known as \\"Raattinamam ... Gandhi Kai Bhanamaam ...\\", was sung by T. P. Rajalakshmi, and was unrelated to the story of Kalidas; the song extolled the charkha (spinning wheel), a Gandhian symbol of nationalism. Rajalakshmi also performed two of Tyagaraja's compositions, \\"Enta Nerchina\\" and \\"Suraragadhara\\", the latter of which was based on the Shankarabharanam raga, for the film. Another song which Rajalakshmi performed, \\"Manmada Baanamadaa\\", became immensely popular, and was described by Guy as \\"the emotional outburst of love by the heroine\\". Another song, \\"Indhiyargal Nammavarkkul Eno Veen Sandai\\", spoke about the Indian independence movement and the need for unity among Indians. Guy described \\"Manmada Baanamadaa\\" as the \\"first hit song of Tamil Cinema\\".  Release  alt=Tamil language advertisement with all text, no visuals An advertisement announcing the release of Kalidas was published on 30 October 1931 in The Hindu, where it was proclaimed that the film was the \\"first talkie to be screened in the city with Tamil and Telugu songs\\". Kalidas was first released theatrically at the Madras (now Chennai) based theatre Kinema Central (now known as the Murugan Theatre) on 31 October 1931, during the festive occasion of Diwali and coincided with the Civil Disobedience Movement. When the film reels were taken to Madras, thousands of people gathered at the city's central railway station and followed the reel box along Wall Tax Road to Kinema Central, throwing rose petals, breaking open coconuts, and burning incense. The posters of the film read, Tamil Telugu pesi paadu padam (). An earlier attempt at producing a Tamil sound film, a four-reel short (identified by S. Theodore Baskaran as Korathi Dance and Songs), was screened alongside Kalidas as a side attraction. It starred Rajalakshmi, and the gypsy dancer Jhansi Bai. In a 2015 interview with The Times of India, Rajalakshmi's daughter Kamala stated that during the film's release, \\"people in Madras used to stand outside theatres for a distance of about 4-5km to witness [Rajalakshmi] acting in her first pesum padam. She was welcomed with a roar here. Her name was announced from speakers installed on roads and autorickshaws, as a talkie was something new for the people.\\" Kalidas was commercially successful, grossing over 75,000 (about US$25,252 in 1931) and easily covering its budget of 8,000 (about US$2,693 in 1931) according to a 2013 estimate by The Hindu Tamil. Film producer and writer G. Dhananjayan said the film succeeded because it was a \\"novelty for the audience to witness an audio visual with dialogues and songs of their language\\". In his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema, Randor Guy described Kalidas as a \\"crude experiment\\" that had poor lip sync; when characters opened their mouths there was no sound, and when dialogue or song was heard, artistes remained silent. He said the public did not care about technical niceties and flocked to see the film. Film critic and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy, in his review of the film for Ananda Vikatan, noted that he was awestruck by the costumes used. He praised Rajalakshmi's performance and her dancing but criticised her singing, saying that she had to go see a doctor to get her vocal cords fixed. The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran printed a favourable review for Kalidas on 29 October 1931, two days prior to its theatrical release, where the reviewer, in contrast to Krishnamurthy's comments, appreciated Rajalakshmi's singing.  Legacy  The arrival of sound in South Indian cinema, with the release of Kalidas, triggered a migration of theatre artists into cinema. Kalidas was the only South Indian film to be produced and released in 1931. No print or gramophone record of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film. The Indian Express stated in 2014 that the film had \\"turned to dust\\" long before the National Film Archive of India was established in 1964. The only remaining artefacts include a few stills, advertisements, and an image of the cover of the songbook. As of December 2002, Film News Anandan had preserved several photographs related to the film. Kalidas was a major breakthrough in Rajalakshmi's career, and made her a \\"bankable singing star\\". Other films based on the life of KƒÅlidƒÅsa include the Kannada film Mahakavi Kalidasa (1955), which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Kannada, the Hindi film Kavi Kalidas (1959), the Telugu film Mahakavi Kalidasu (1960), the Tamil film Mahakavi Kalidas (1966), and the Kannada film Kaviratna Kalidasa (1983).

Besides the modern language whose shape and orthography was standardized in the late 19th century, it also covers the oldest works produced within the modern borders of Croatia, written in Church Slavonic and Medieval Latin, as well as vernacular works written in ƒåakavian and Kajkavian dialects. History =Croatian medieval literature= Croatian medieval prose is similar to other European medieval literature of the time. The oldest testaments to Croatian literacy are dated to the 11th and 12th centuries, and Croatian medieval literature lasts until the middle of the 16th century. Some elements of medieval forms can be found even in 18th century Croatian literature, which means that their influence had been stronger in Croatia than in the rest of Europe. Early Croatian literature was inscribed on stone tablets, hand-written on manuscripts, and printed in books. A special segment of Croatian medieval literature is written in Latin. The first works on hagiography and the history of the Church were written in the Dalmatian coastal cities (Split, Zadar, Trogir, Osor, Dubrovnik, Kotor), for example the \\"Splitski evanƒëelistar\\" (6th‚Äì7th century) and other liturgical and non-liturgical works. The beginning of Croatian medieval literature is marked by Latin hagiography, with texts about Dalmatian and Istrian martyrs: Saint Duje, Saint Anastasius, Saint Maurice and Saint Germanus. In Panonia in northern Croatia, works about Christian cults were created, such as that of Saint Quirinus, Saint Eusebius and Saint Pollio. For centuries, the Croats wrote all their works regarding law, history (chronicles) and scientific works in Latin, so they were available as part of a wider European literature. Croatian medieval prose was written in two languages: Croatian and Church Slavonic, using three different alphabets, Glagolitic, Latinic and Bosnian Cyrillic. Among these there was some interaction, as evidenced by documents carrying two forms of letters; especially with respect to Glagolitic and Cyrillic texts, and some Latin relied on Glagolitic forms. That interaction makes Croatian writing unique among Slavic prose, and even in European literature. Croatian medieval literature reflects the general trends within European literature, though there were some different traits, for example, literature directed at the common people; a strong background tradition of oral literature, blending religious topics and interweaving of genres. A significant part of Croatian early literature is based on translations, with typical Central European edits. Croatian early literature was influenced by two spheres: from the East (Byzantine and Church Slavonic inheritance) and from the West (from Latin, Italian, Franco-Italian and Czech traditions). Ba≈°ka tablet (1100) From the 14th century, western influence remained strong in Croatian literature. Recognizing these patterns, Croatian authors, mostly anonymous, adapted their work to the specific needs of the community in which and for which they wrote. Despite their writings being in large part translations, this literature achieved a notably artistic level of language and style. One of the most significant achievements was keeping alive the Church Slavonic literal language (especially in the Glagolitic alphabet). In later periods elements of that language came to be used in expressive ways and as a signal of \\"high style\\", incorporating current vernacular words and becoming capable of transferring knowledge on a wide range of subjects, from law and theology, chronicles and scientific texts, to works of literature. Such medieval works in the people's own language are the starting point for the literature of later periods. Anonymous poets and singers, developing their own styles, of typically religious poetry, and of this period, were referred to as the \\"zaƒçinjavci\\" by later authors and sources. The oldest artefacts of Croatian medieval prose are glagolitic inscribed stone tablets: Valun tablet, Plomin tablet and the Krk inscription from the 11th century, and the Ba≈°ka tablet from the 11th or 12th century. The Ba≈°ka tablet is the first complete document we have on the language of the people with elements of literal Church Slavonic. It is often regarded as the \\"birth certificate\\" of the Croatian language, and carries the first mention of the Croats. The inscribed stone records King Zvonimir's donation of a piece of land to a Benedictine abbey in the time of Abbot Drzhiha. It provides the only example of the transition from Glagolitic of the rounded Macedonian type to the angular Croatian alphabet. Vinodol Statute (1288)Other early writings are the Senj tablet, Plastovo tablet, Knin tablet and Supetar tablet, all dating to the 12th century and the Hum tablet from the 11th or 12th century. The fragments of the Vienna leaves from a Glagolithic codex dating from 11th/12th century, written somewhere in Western Croatia, represents the first liturgical writing of Croatian recension in the Church Slavonic. The Povlja tablet (Croatian: Povaljska listina) is the earliest document written in the Cyrillic script, dating from the 12th century and tracing its origin to Braƒç.,Raƒçki, F. 1881. Najstarija hrvatska cirilicom pisana listina. Starine 13, JAZU, Zagreb, 197‚Äì210. it features the standard \\"archaic\\" Chakavian dialect. Other legal documents such as the Vrbnik Statute, Vinodol statute and Kastav Statute describe the regulations of those coastal cities as administrative centres. From hand-written documents, only fragments are saved, and they bear witness to a rich literary tradition on Croatian soil. These are part of biblical-liturgical works: fragments of apostles, such as Mihanoviƒá's apostle and Gra≈°koviƒá's fragment, both created in the 12th century; fragments of missals such as the first page of Kievan papers from the 11th or 12th century and the Vienna papers from the 12th century, those are the oldest Croatian documents of liturgical content; fragments of breviaries, like the London fragments, Vrbnik fragments and Roƒçki fragments, all dating to the 13th century. All of the glagolitic documents form a continuity with those created at the same time in Bulgarian, Macedonian, Czech and Russian areas. But by the 12th and 13th centuries the Croats had developed their own form of glagolitic script, and were adapting the Croatian language with Chakavian influences. In doing so, the Croats formed their own version of Church Slavonic which lasted into the 16th century. At the same time, biblical books were written according to the model of the Latin Vulgate. From that time come the oldest surviving texts of hagiographic legends and apocryphal prose, an example being the Budapest fragments (12th century with part of a legend about Saint Simeon and Saint Thecla from the 13th century, part of apocryphal works of Paul and Thecla). =Renaissance literature= Missale Romanum Glagolitice The first book printed in Croatian is the Missale Romanum Glagolitice (). Dating from 1483, it was notable as being the first non-Latin printed missal anywhere in Europe. It is also the first printed book of the South Slavic idiom. New poetical forms from elsewhere in Europe were absorbed during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Croatian renaissance, strongly influenced by Italian and western European literature, was most fully developed in the coastal areas of Croatia. In the Republic of Ragusa, (today's Dubrovnik), there was a flowering of vernacular lyrical poetry, particularly love poems. One of the most important records of the early works is Nik≈°a Ranjina's Miscellany, a collection of poems, mostly written by ≈†i≈°ko Menƒçetiƒá and D≈æore Dr≈æiƒá. Poems in the miscellany deal chiefly with the topic of love and are written predominantly in a doubly-rhymed dodecasyllabic meter. In Split, the Dalmatian humanist Marko Maruliƒá was widely known in Europe at the time for his writings in Latin, but his major legacy is considered to be his works in Croatian,Marulianum Center for study of Marko Maruliƒá and his literary activity. ‚Äì Retrieved on 28 November 2015. the most celebrated of which is the epic poem Judita, written in 1501 and published in Venice in 1521. It is based on the Biblical tale from a Deuterocanonical Book of Judith and written in the ƒåakavian dialect and the work is described by him as u versi haruacchi slozhena (\\"arranged in Croatian stanzas\\"). It incorporates figures and events from the classical Bible, adapting them for contemporary literature.Dunja Fali≈°evac, Kre≈°imir Nemec, Darko Novakoviƒá (2000). Leksikon hrvatskih pisaca. Zagreb: ≈†kolska knjiga d.d. . The next important artistic figure in the early stages of the Croatian renaissance was Petar Hektoroviƒá, the song collector and poet from the island of Hvar, most notable for his poem Fishing and Fishermen's Talk. It is the first piece of Croatian literature written in verse in which travel is not described allegorically, but as a real journey, describing the beauties of nature and homeland. Hektoroviƒá also recorded the songs sung by the fishermen, making this one of the earliest examples in Croatian literature to include transcribed folk music within the text. This makes Ribanje a work that blends artistic and folk literature. At the same time in Hvar, Hanibal Luciƒá was translating Ovid's work (Croatian: \\"\\"). He also wrote drama, (The Slave Girl being the first secular play in Croatian literature) and love poetry. Croatian literature expanded into prose and plays with authors such as Dinko Zlatariƒá, Mavro Vetranoviƒá and Marin Dr≈æiƒá. The first Croatian novel, (Mountains) written by Petar Zoraniƒá and published posthumously in 1569 in Venice, featured the author as an adventurer, portraying his passionate love towards a native girl. It was uniquely stylized, and provided a description of the surrounding land against the backdrop of the then current political situation of invading Turks. = Baroque literature = Ivan Gunduliƒá (1589/8-1638) The prevailing Baroque culture emerged in Croatia later during the 17th century, where it was a period of counter-reformation. In literature, it was marked by flamboyance, with pious and lofty themes using rich metaphors in which the form becomes more important than the content. Regional literary circles developed, such as Dubrovnik, Slavic, Kajkav and Ozalj.Hrvatska barokna knji%C5%BEevnost (Croatian baroque literature) At this time, the lack of a standard Croatian language became a prominent issue. Dubrovnik became the chief literary centre, with Ivan Gunduliƒá playing a leading role. Gunduliƒá's most famous play is Dubravka, a pastoral written in 1628, where he rhapsodises on the former glory of Dubrovnik and it contains some of the most famous verses in Croatian literature: O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo (Fair liberty, beloved liberty, liberty sweetly avowed). In his greatest work, Osman, Gunduliƒá presents the contrasts between Christianity and Islam, Europe and the Turks, West and East, and what he viewed as freedom and slavery. The work is firmly rooted within the rich literary tradition of the Croatian Baroque in Dubrovnik and Dalmatia and is considered one of its masterpieces. Other notable literary figures in Dubrovnik at the time were Junije Palmotiƒá, Ivan Buniƒá Vuƒçiƒá, Ignjat ƒêurƒëeviƒá, Stijepo ƒêurƒëeviƒá, Vladislav Menƒçetiƒá, Petar Boga≈°inoviƒá, Petar Kanaveliƒá, Jerolim Kavanjin and Rafael Levakoviƒá. Many works were translated from Latin and Italian into the local vernacular language and specifically, that used by the lower-class peasantry of the city.Stephen R. Graubard (1998). A New Europe for the Old?, Transaction Publishers, Most notable works from northern, continental literary circles include Fran Krsto Frankopan's Gartlic za ƒças kratiti, a collection of lyric poems and Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá's Odiljenje sigetsko, an intertextual lyrical work written in innovative genre first published in 1684. Katarina Zrinska published her 1660 prayer book Putni tovaru≈° in Venice, which is praised by literary historians as a high literary achievement of the Croatian Baroque literature. In the kajkav circle, the most important figure was the Jesuit Juraj Habdeliƒá who wrote on religious themes. His best-known work is Zrcalo Mariansko (Mary's Mirror), and he produced a kajkav to Latin dictionary. Petar Zrinski translated his brother Nikola's epic poem The Siren of the Adriatic Sea into CroatianIn the Slavic circle, another Jesuit, Antun Kani≈æliƒá wrote the epic poem Sveta Ro≈æalija (St Rosalia) the story of the saint of Palermo. The Ozalj circle is characterised by the language that unites all three dialects ‚Äì kajkavian dialect mixed with ƒçakavian, ≈°tokavian and ikav-ekav elements. The most important authors in this circle are Petar Zrinski, Ana Katarina Zrinska, Fran Krsto Frankopan and Ivan Belostenec. A large number of scientific works were also produced at this time, especially lexicons. * Ivan Luciƒá wrote the first scientific history of Croatia in Latin: De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae. * Ivan Belostenec, a Pauline monk and member of the ozalj circle wrote a kajkav-Latin dictionary: Gazophylacium. * Jakov Mikalja, wrote a Croatian-Italian-Latin dictionary: Blago jezika slovniskoga (Blessed Slavic language) and published the first orthography of the Slavic languages * Bartol Ka≈°iƒá, whose most important work is Institutionum linguae Illyricae, the first Croatian grammar which was published in Rome in Latin. =18th century literature and the Age of Enlightenment= Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá In the 18th century there was a new attitude to towards literature, as the greater part of Dalmatia and Slavonia were freed from Ottoman rule, and new ideas of Enlightenment were circulating from Western Europe, especially with regard to the social reforms of Maria Theresa and Joseph II in the northern part of Croatia. The artistic range is not as great in this period as during the Renaissance or the baroque, but there is a greater distribution of works and a growing integration of the literature of the separate areas of Dalmatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Slavonia, Dubrovnik and northwestern Croatia, which will lead into the national and political movements of the 19th century. The most prominent Croatian author of the Enlightenment era was Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá, who was a historian and the founder of the modern Pan-slavic ideology. He published histories (\\"Stemmatographia\\", \\"Croatia Rediviva\\"), epics (\\"Odiljenje sigetsko\\"), reformed the lettering system, formed a printing press, and wrote chronicles and calendars. Many of his ideas formed the basis of the later Illyrian Movement (also known as the \\"Croatian National Revival\\") protesting the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.Antoni Cetnarowicz: National revival in Dalmatia, Central Europe, Zagreb, 2006., The Slavonian Antun Kani≈æliƒá, author of the poem Sveta Ro≈æalija, was the first of the northern writers to encounter the work of the Dubrovnik poets, particularly that of Ignjat ƒêurdeviƒáa. Kani≈æliƒá was one of the main protagonists of the \\"Slavonskoga duhovnoga preporoda\\" (Slavonian spiritual revival), which was strongly influenced by the southern literature from Dalmatia. In Dubrovnik at that time were a number of prominent scholars, philosophers and writers in Latin, for example Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá, Bernard D≈æamanjiƒá, D≈æono Rastiƒá, and at the turn of the 19th century ƒêuro Hid≈æa and Marko Bruereviƒá-Desrivaux who wrote in Latin, Italian and Croatian. Towards the end of the period, a comprehensive Dubrovnik dictionary was published by the Franciscan Joakim Stuliƒá. A famous Latin scholar in northern Croatia was chronicler Baltazar Adam Krƒçeliƒá, while in Slavonia, Matija Petar Katanƒçiƒá (author of the first Croatian printed version of the bible) and Titu≈° Brezovaƒçki (the most important playwright in the kajkav area) also wrote in Croatian. Matija Antun Reljkoviƒá A special place in the literature of the 18th century is held by the poet and writer Filip Grabovac and the Franciscan writer Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá. Grabovac's \\"Cvit razgovora naroda i jezika iliriƒçkoga aliti rvackoga\\" (Conversation of peasants and the Illyrian language), from 1747 unites Croatian medieval literature with that of the Bosnian Franciscans, while Kaƒçiƒá's \\"Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskoga\\" (Peasant conversation of Slavic people) from 1756 in verse and prose, was once one of the most widely read books in the Croatian language (translated into a dozen languages and has been reprinted almost 70 times by the end of the 20th century). It was this work, together with that of Matija Antun Relkoviƒá, that definitively set the idioms for the Croatian language in the Croatian National Revival movement. Relkoviƒá, as a prisoner in Dresden, compared Slavonia with Germany in his 1762 poem \\"Satir iliti divji ƒçovik\\" (Satyr or Wild man). Relkoviƒá's influence is generally contained in his linguistic idioms and other grammatical and philological works. Having spread the ≈°tokavian idiom in the second half of the 18th century, he is, along with Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá, considered to be one of the most decisive influences that helped shape the Croatian standard language. Other notable contributors of religious and educational work, lexigraphic, grammars and histories, were Bosnian Franciscans, most notably Filip Lastriƒá, Nikola La≈°vanin and from Hercegovina, Lovro Sitoviƒá Ljubu≈°ak. In Slavonia, besides Kani≈æliƒá, other authors were writing moral teachings and Enlightenment ideas in verse. Theatre in the 18th century was performed in almost all the coastal cities from Dubrovnik, Hvar and Korƒçula to Zadar, Senj and Rijeka, and in northern Croatia from Zagreb and Vara≈ædin to Po≈æega and Osijek. In Dubrovnik, 23 plays by Moli√®re were translated and performed, still unusual at the time. The best drama written in the Croatian language during the 18th century was \\"Kate Kapuralica\\" by Vlaha Stulli. The great playwright of the period was Titu≈° Brezovaƒçki who wrote in the kajkav dialect (¬´Matija≈° grabancija≈° dijak¬ª, ¬´Diogene≈°¬ª). = Romanticism and the Croatian National Revival = See also: Illyrian language conceptionsBrief Basics of the Croatian-Slavonic Orthography (1830)The basic component of Romanticism in Croatian literature is the growing movement towards national identity. In addition to connecting with their local heritage, there was a belated influence of German Romanticism and the national awareness of other areas within the Habsburg monarchy. Since almost all Croatian poets of the time also wrote in German, the Croatian linguistic and cultual emancipation followed Central European patterns that were rooted in German culture and literature.Charles W. Ingrao, Franz A.J. Szabo (Eds.): The Gemans and the East p. 142 The Illyrian movement began in 1835 as a small circle of mostly younger intellectuals, led by Ljudevit Gaj, based around the magazine \\"Danice ilirske\\" (Illyrian Morning Star). They had plans for the cultural, scientific, educational and economic development of Croatia. At the centre of their activities was reform of the language, in particular, the foundation of a single standard, based on the rich literary heritage. A common orthographic book set the new grammatical standards for the language, had been published by Gaj in 1830, entitled \\"Kratka osnova horvatsko-slavenskog pravopisanja\\" (otherwise known as \\"Gaj's Latin alphabet\\"). Gaj's Latin alphabet was one of the two official scripts used to write Serbo-Croatian until the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Novelists of the period were Ivan Ma≈æuraniƒá, Stanko Vraz and Petar Preradoviƒá. Ma≈æuraniƒá's poem \\"Smrt Smail-age ƒåengiƒáa\\" (The Death of Smail-aga ƒåengiƒá) (1846) is considered to be the most mature work of Croatian romanticism, a combination of Dubrovnik literary style and folk epic tradition. The literary magazine \\"Kolo\\" (Wheel) was launched in 1842 by Dragutin Rakovac, Ljudevit Vukotinoviƒá and Stanko Vraz. It was the first Croatian periodical to set high aesthetic and critical standards. Writing patriotic, love and reflective lyrics Preradoviƒá became the most prolific and popular poet of the period. Dimitrije Demeter, author of the patriotic epic \\"Grobniƒçko polje\\" (Grobnik Plain) in 1842, laid the foundation for the New Croatian Theatre, as manager and writer. His most important dramatic work \\"Teuta\\" (1844) draws on Illyrian history. Other writers of the time are Antun Nemƒçiƒá, author of one of the few comedy-dramas \\"Kvas bez kruha\\" (Yeast bread), and who was also known for his travel writing: \\"Putositnice\\", and \\"Pogled u Bosnu\\" (View into Bosnia). Matija Ma≈æuraniƒá wrote some of the best prose of the period. Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski was a politician, scientist, historian, and the first writer of plays based on more recent Croatian literature: \\"Jurana i Sofije\\" (1839), and he also wrote travelogue texts. Ljudevit Vukotinoviƒá began writing in the kajkav dialect and along with Vraz is one of the pioneers of literary criticism. Other notable literary contributions were made by Antun Mihanoviƒá (notably Horvatska Domovina which later became Our Beautiful Homeland) = Protorealism and Realism = Statue of August ≈†enoa in Vla≈°ka street, ZagrebThe period after 1848 saw a new generation of writers who acted as a transition between Romanticism and Realism. Some literary historians refer to it as \\"Protorealism\\", a time marked by the author August ≈†enoa whose work combined the flamboyant language of national romanticism with realistic depictions of peasant life. ≈†enoa considered that Croatian literature was too remote from real people's lives and that artistic creations should have a positive effect on the nation. He introduced the historical novel into Croatian literature, and from 1874 to 1881 edited the literary journal \\"Vienac\\" (Wreath) which was the focal point of Croatian literary life until 1903. It was in that magazine that he published many of his works, including the first modern Croatian novel \\"Zlatarovo zlato\\" (Goldsmith's Gold, 1871), poems, stories, and historical novels, making him the most prominent Croatian writer of the 19th century. The patronage of Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer enabled the founding of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1866, as well as the re-establishment of the University of Zagreb in 1874. Another important figure of the time was Adolfo Veber Tkalƒçeviƒá, a philologist, writer, literary critic and aestheticist. He continued the tradition of the Illyrian movement, at the same time introducing elements of Realism into Croatian literature. He was the author of the first syntax of Croatian literary language, Skladanja ilirskog jezika (\\"Composing the Illyrian language\\", Vienna 1859). He authored several school-level textbooks and his Slovnica hrvatska published in 1871 was both a standard high-school textbook and a norm and codification of standard language for the period. Also at that transition time were the poet, playwright and novelist Mirko Bogoviƒá, poet and teacher Dragojla Jarneviƒá, storyteller and collector of folk ballads Mato Vodopiƒá, Vienac editor Ivan Perkovac, poet Luka Botiƒá and philosopher and writer Franjo Markoviƒá. Politician and publicist Ante Starƒçeviƒá wrote poetry, plays and literary critiques. Josip Eugen Tomiƒá wrote poems, comedies and historical novels, Rikard Jorgovaniƒá was a poet and storyteller. ≈†enoa's requirements to provide literature for the people paved the way for Realism. The cultural framework of the time was bound up with national and political issues, and many young writers were involved with political parties. A large number of writers from the various Croatian provinces helped to bring the new direction into Croatian literature. The first Croatian author of the new form was Eugen Kumiƒçiƒá, who encountered Realism in Paris. As a writer of Istrian, Zagreb and Croatian history, he moved between romanticism and naturalism in his \\"Olga i Lina\\" (1881). A younger, and more radical, militant writer was Ante Kovaƒçiƒá, who wrote a series of poems, short stories and novels, the best-known of which is \\"U registraturi\\" (In the Register, 1888). The work combines biting social satire with naturalist descriptions of Croatian bureaucracy and peasantry, along with a fascination with the supernatural inherited from Romanticism, and was one of the most powerful novels in 19th-century Croatian literature. Ksaver ≈†andor Gjalski dealt with subjects from Zagorje's upper class (\\"Pod starimi krovovi\\", Under Old Roofs, 1886), affected poetic realism and highlighted the political situation in ¬ªU noƒái¬´ (In the Night, 1887). Vjencelav Novak The most prolific writer of Croatian Realism was Vjenceslav Novak, starting from his hometown in Senj, broadened his range to include Zagreb and Prague. In his best novel \\"Posljednji Stipanƒçiƒái\\" (The Last Stipanƒçiƒás, 1899) dealt with the collapse of a Senj patrician family. Meanwhile, Josip Kozarac wrote about the penetration of foreign capital into the previously patriarchal Slavonia (\\"Mrtvi kapitali\\", Dead Capital, 1890; \\"Tena\\", 1894). Towards the end of the Realist period, Janko Leskovar wrote his psychological novels, for example \\"Misao na vjeƒçnost\\" (1891), in which he would analyse his characters. His work would lead directly into Modernism in Croatian literature. Silvije Strahimir Kranjƒçeviƒá was the most important of the 19th-century poets: (\\"Bugarkinje\\", Folk Songs 1885; \\"Izabrane pjesme\\", Selected Poems 1898; \\"Trzaji\\", Spasms 1902). Drawing on the style of earlier patriotic poetry, he used sharp sarcasm and cold irony, along with deep pathos and rhetoric. He embraced universal and cosmic themes, which made the young Kranjƒçeviƒá stand out among his contemporaries, such as August Haramba≈°iƒá, whose main themes were patriotism or romantic love. Josip Dra≈æenoviƒá's \\"Crtice iz primorskoga malogradskoga ≈æivota\\" (Sketches from a Coastal Small Town Life, 1893) focused on people and their relationships on the Croatian coast at the end of the 19th century. At the threshold of the modernist era, the poet, playwright and novelist Ante Tresiƒá Paviƒçiƒá brought classical and Italian poetry forms into his work. The collections \\"Valovi misli i ƒçuvstava\\" (Waves of Thought and Emotion, 1903), and \\"Sutonski soneti\\" (Twilight Sonnets, 1904) were to influence some of his younger contemporaries. =Modern literature= Modern literature up to 1914 Statue of A.G. Mato≈° in Zagreb The modernist movement manifested itself not only in literature, but also in the visual arts, and other aspects of cultural and national life. From the beginning, there were two distinct threads: one mainly apolitical, cosmopolitan, and aesthetic (\\"Mladost\\", \\"Hrvatski salon\\", \\"≈Ωivot\\"), while the other was younger, more progressive and political (\\"Nova nada\\", \\"Hrvatska misao\\", \\"Novo doba\\", \\"Narodna misao\\", \\"Glas\\"). A few prominent writers, such as Antun Gustav Mato≈° and Dinko ≈†imunoviƒá, were not involved in either movement. The difference between \\"old\\" and \\"young\\" lasted for more than a decade and was related to similar movements in the rest of Europe. In addition, there was a new openness to other influences and literature in French, German, Russian, Italian, Polish and Czech all left their mark. The struggle for creative freedom in literature and the arts was led by modern idealist Milivoj De≈æman (Ivanov). On the other side, Milan Marjanoviƒá believed that Croatian literature should be the driving force in the political struggle of the people. Similar thinkers of the time were Ante Kovaƒçiƒá, Silvije Strahimir Kranjƒçeviƒá and Vladimir Nazor. The novelist and playwright Milutin Cihlar Nehajev, (\\"Veliki grad\\", Big City, 1919), wrote a series of essays on national and foreign writers, and his \\"Bijeg\\" (Escape, 1909) is considered typical of Croatian modernist novels with its alienated and confused vision looking to solve national problems by escape. Milan Begoviƒá Modernism was particularly strong in the field of poetry. The freely- expressed eroticism, ecstasy and rebellion against the discipline of life in Milan Begoviƒá's \\"Knjiga Boccadoro\\" (Boccadoro Book, 1900) acted as a manifesto and remains a standard of Croatian poetry. Begoviƒá's poetry was similar in style to that of Dragutin Domjaniƒá, although Domjaniƒá tended to be more lyrical and sentimental. He achieved some success with his poem \\"Kipci i popevke\\", (Statuettes and popular songs 1917). Another prominent poet of the period was Vladimir Vidriƒá, whose work forms part of the wider European symbolism movement. In theatre, Ivo Vojnoviƒá captivated the public with plays such as \\"Ekvinocij\\" (Equinox, 1895). Although his early works dealt with cosmopolitan themes, Dubrovnik remained his major inspiration especially in \\"Dubrovaƒçka trilogija\\" (Dubrovnik Trilogy, 1903). In that work, the subject relates to realism, although the technique and inspiration is entirely modernist. Vladimir Nazor Around the same time, Vladimir Nazor began his career, and was to become one of the most versatile and prolific authors of the modern age (\\"Slavenske legende\\", Slavic Legends, 1900). His writing is modernist, though based on a realist tradition. Some of the most outstanding narrative prose was written by Dinko ≈†imunoviƒá, whose novels described life in the rural hinterland of Dalmatia. Two very successful playwrights of the time were Milan Ogrizoviƒá and Josip Kosor. Ogrizoviƒá used themes from folk songs in works such as (\\"Hasanaginica\\"), and he also wrote passionate dramas (\\"Vuƒçina\\", 1921), while Kosor is best known for his dramatic \\"Po≈æar strasti\\" (Fire of Passion, 1912). The novelist Franjo Horvat Ki≈° wrote about life in the Croatian zagorje, while Ivan Kozarac wrote novels \\"ƒêuka Begoviƒá\\" (Devil's Blood, 1911), about Slavonia. The forerunner of modern fiction was Janko Poliƒá Kamov, poet (\\"Psovka\\", \\"I≈°tipana hartija\\", 1907), narrator, innovative novelist (\\"Isu≈°ena kalju≈æa\\" 1957), playwright essayist and critic. His prose remains essentially modern even today in both its structure and subject. The most complete European and Croatian writer of the period was Antun Gustav Mato≈°, who wrote his first short story in 1892 \\"Moƒá savjesti\\" (The Power of Conscience). His work spanning essays, reviews, novels, poems, and travel books was highly influential. The publication of the anthology Croatian Young Lyrics (1914) marked an end of an era ‚Äì the year that Antun Gustav Mato≈° died and the First World War began. Twelve authors contributed to the anthology: Ivo Andriƒá, Vladimir ƒåerina, Vilko Gabariƒá, Karl Hausler, Zvonko Milkoviƒá, Stjepan Parmaƒçeviƒá, Janko Poliƒá Kamov, Tin Ujeviƒá, Milan Vrbaniƒá, Ljubo Wiesner and Fran Galoviƒá. All of these authors were influenced by Antun Gustav Mato≈° and Vladimir Vidriƒá, and many would later become well-known names in Croatian literature. Ivana Brliƒá-Ma≈æuraniƒá Fran Galoviƒá, a prolific writer of modern novels and plays, was also known for poems in his native Podravina dialect (\\"Z mojih bregov\\", From My Hills, published in 1925). Vladimir ƒåerina was best known for his poems \\"Raspeƒáe\\", Crucifixon, 1912. Ivana Brliƒá- Ma≈æuraniƒá achieved success as a writer of Croatian fairytales (\\"Priƒçe iz davnine\\", Fairytales, 1916) which interweave fantasy with real characters. The journalist Marija Juriƒá Zagorka wrote historical novels that achieved great popularity. A. G. Mato≈° in this period published critical reviews \\"Na≈°i ljudi i krajevi\\" (Our People and Regions, 1910) and \\"Peƒçalba\\" (Profit, 1913), and wrote serials and poems. The political events of the early 20th century and the movement for a united south Slavic state (Yugoslavia) were compelling topics in the literature of the time. Ivo Vojnoviƒá wrote about the Vidovdan myth, while Srƒëan Tuciƒá published \\"Osloboditelje\\" (Liberators, 1914). Vladimir Nazor wrote several works on the theme of Croatian history \\"Velog Jo≈æe\\" (1908), \\"Hrvatske kraljeve\\" (Croatian Kings, 1912), \\"Istarske priƒçe\\" (Istrian Tales, 1913) and \\"Medvjeda Brundu\\" (Bear Brundu, 1915). Milan Ogrizoviƒá's play \\"Banoviƒá Strahinja\\" was shown in 1912. Modern literature between the wars 1914 to 1945 The period immediately before the First World War was marked by a new avant-garde movement. Janko Poliƒá Kamov, in his short life, was an early forerunner, with his modernist novel \\"Isu≈°ena kalju≈æa\\" (The Drained Swamp, 1906‚Äì1909) now considered to be the first major Croatian prose work of the genre. A new generation of futurist young writers began to appear, where expressive use of words was more important than a formal structure. Along with the new literary styles, came a stronger politicization of content that would continue to mark poetry and prose during the First World War and beyond. =Literary magazines and Matica hrvatska= The magazine \\"Vihor\\" (Whirlwind, 1914) gathered together a group of young writers who supported the unification of the South Slavs. In this, they were strongly influenced by the expressive and ideological works of sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, and writers Ivo Vojnoviƒá and Vladimir Nazor, who before the First World War had revived common Slavic mythology. Avant-garde poetry was published in a number of magazines, for example, \\"Kokot\\" (1916), \\"Vijavica\\" (1917), \\"Juri≈°\\" (1919) and \\"Knji≈æevnik\\" (1924). Along with the avant-garde, mainly expressionist poetry, Leninist revolutionary ideas were promoted in magazines such as \\"Plamen\\" (1919) and \\"Zenit\\" (1921‚Äì23 in Zagreb; 1924‚Äì26 in Belgrade). Ljubo Miciƒá was the most radical promoter of the avant-garde in literature, music, and art, advocating \\"zenitizam\\" as a synthesis of the original Balkan spirit and contemporary European trends (futurism, expressionism, dadaism, surrealism). Miroslav Krle≈æa in 1953 In addition to these avant-garde magazines, a significant contribution to the literary life of the period role was played by DHK \\"Savremenik\\" (published intermittently 1906‚Äì41), which gathered together writers of different generations and poetic orientations, \\"Hrvatska njiva\\" (1917‚Äì26; from 1919 \\"Jugoslavenska njiva\\") offered more moderately traditional poetic viewpoints as in \\"Vijenac\\" (Wreath, 1913‚Äì28). The magazine \\"Nova Evropa\\" (1920‚Äì41), with its liberal and south Slav unity orientation, had a strong impact in the first half of the 1920s. Miroslav Krle≈æa in 1923 launched his second magazine \\"Knji≈æevna republika\\" (Literary Republic, banned in 1927), bringing together leading leftist writers, focusing on inequality and social injustice, offering a sharp critique of the ruling regime in Yugoslavia. After the assassination of Stjepan Radiƒá and the introduction of the dictatorship at the beginning of 1929, consciousness of a Croatian identity strengthened among many writers, along with a growing resistance to Serbian dominance. Since normal legitimate political activities were limited by public safety orders, the movement found expression in cultural associations and literary publications. Matica hrvatska became the centre of intellectual and literary gatherings, within which Communist writers such as Miroslav Krle≈æa and August Cesarec were active. Their magazine \\"Hrvatska revija\\" (Croatian Review, 1928) provided the Croatian literary voice of the time, bringing together the best authors of all orientations. But the Matica administration gradually eased out the leftist writers, particularly after Filip Lukas' article \\"Ruski komunizam spram nacionalnog principa\\" (Russian communism as opposed to national principles, 1933). Those with strong nationalistic views moved to magazines such as \\"Hrvatska smotra\\" (Croatian Folklore, 1933‚Äì45), and \\"Hrvatska prosvjeta\\" (Croatian education, 1914‚Äì40), while most leftist Croatian authors gathered around \\"Knji≈æevnici\\" (Writers, 1928‚Äì39), which in its early years was open to liberal ideas, then around the journal \\"Kritika\\" (1928), \\"Literatura\\" (1931‚Äì33), \\"Kultura\\" (1933) and \\"Izraz\\" (Expression, 1939‚Äì41). =Increasing conflict= Towards the end of the 1920s and into the 1930s, turmoil within the international leftist movement (clashes at the First International Conference of Proletarian and Revolutionary Writers (1927), Kharkov Congress (1930), Moscow Congress of Soviet Writers (1934) between leftist avant-garde authors and those engaged in writing social literature,i.e. propaganda) had its echoes in Yugoslavia. The most prominent left-wing author, Miroslav Krle≈æa found himself in conflict with the authorities as he refused to lower his standards, as he saw it, and become a mere tool for ideological goals. The debate grew increasingly heated while Krle≈æa was publishing the magazine \\"Danas\\" (Today, 1934) and \\"Peƒçat\\" (Stamp, 1939‚Äì40), culminating in his highly critical essay \\"Dijalektiƒçki antibarbarus\\" (Dialectical antibarbarus, 1939), which brought him into direct conflict with the leadership of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (who responded by publishing the collection \\"Knji≈æevne sveske\\" (Literary Volume, 1940)). =Second World War= Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá The establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in 1941 brought hope amongst some that the end of monarchist Yugoslavia would unleash a new creative energy. But the fascist ideology, the strong link to the Axis powers, the repressive practices of the Ustasha regime towards intellectuals (including the murder of Cesarec, Ker≈°ovani, Mi≈°kina and a slew of others), and the persecution of Communists and members of national minorities, pushed Croatia's intellectuals to distance themselves from the regime. Even some leading non-communist writers such as Vladimir Nazor and Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá joined the partisans. While leftist writers who had not been murdered, such as Krle≈æa, were banned altogether from publishing, the Ustasha authorities attempted to organize a literary presence around the Croatian Publishing and Bibliographic Institute, which issued an anthology of poetry and prose, \\"Hrvatska enciklopedija\\" (Croatian encyclopedia). Meanwile, in the territory under partisan control, there was intense literary activity. In addition to Vladimir Nazor and Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá there were Jo≈æa Horvat, Mirko Bo≈æiƒá, Jure Ka≈°telan, Ivan Donƒçeviƒá, Jure Franiƒçeviƒá Ploƒçar, Marin Franiƒçeviƒá, Vjekoslav Kaleb, Vladimir Popoviƒá, ≈Ωivko Jeliƒçiƒá, Josip Barkoviƒá and others. Although the greater part of their literary output was fairly utilitarian, from this time also came artistic masterpieces, such as Kovaƒçiƒá's intensely emotional indictment of war crimes \\"Jama\\" (The Pit, 1944). =Leading writers and their best-known works= *Bosnian Croat Ivo Andriƒá was one of the gifted poets introduced in the 1914 anthology Croatian Young Lyrics. Although after his relocation to Belgrade, he worked within Serbian literature. His early works \\"Ex Ponto\\" (1918), \\"Put Ali ƒêerzeleza\\" (The Path of Ali ƒêerzelez, 1920), \\"Nemiri\\" (Unrest, 1921) were written in Croatian \\"ijekavica\\" dialect (which also sometimes appeared in his later works, especially in the speech of Bosnian friars). He published three prose collections in Belgrade \\"Pripovetke\\" (Stories, 1924, 1931, 1936). Stylistically virtuous, with an exaggerated sense of psychological analysis, pervaded by unobtrusiveness, his prose analyzed civilization and religious controversy on Bosnian soil. Taken with his post-war novels, his work earned him worldwide recognition, crowned by the Nobel Prize in 1961. *ƒêuro Arnold was a writer of romantic poetry in the tradition of August ≈†enoa and Franjo Markoviƒá, publishing several books of poems. \\"Na pragu vjeƒçnosti\\" (Threshold of Eternity, 1935) * Milan Begoviƒá worked as a high school professor in Split before moving to Hamburg and Vienna to pursue a career in theatre. He wrote stories and novels but is best known for plays he wrote in the 1920s and 1930s. The best known titles are \\"Pustolov pred vratima\\" (Adventurer at the Door, 1926) and the comedy \\"Amerikanska jahta u Splitskoj luci\\" (American Yacht in Split Harbour). *Mile Budak's work is strongly marked by his right- wing politics. A prominent member of the Ustasha movement, the founder of the newspaper Hrvatski narod (Croatian People) in 1938, a Minister within the NDH Government, he published literary works intensively in 1930‚Äì45. His most significant work deals with a Lika village, and the disintegration of traditional values within a closed patriarchal community \\"Opanci dida Vidurine\\" (Grandpa Vidurina's shoes, 1933), \\"Ognji≈°te\\" (Fireplace, I-IV, 1938), \\"Kresojiƒáa\\" (Strain, I-III, 1944‚Äì45). He also wrote social novels in which he analyzed the urban environment \\"Direktor Kri≈æaniƒá\\" (Director Kri≈æaniƒá, 1938), \\"Rascvjetana tre≈°nja\\" (Cherry Blossom I-IV, 1939), and a memoir \\"Ratno roblje\\" (Prisoners of war I-II, 1941). Budak was hanged for crimes against humanity after the war. *The poet Dobri≈°a Cesariƒá inherited the spirit of romance (translated Russian and German romantics), and on a stylistic-expressive plan, he inherited the poets of Croatian modernity, wrote a related verse with a strong sense of verse music. In his poems, he took on landscape scenes that had a symbolic function, and his seemingly simple poetry gains a deeper, philosophical meaning. He also dealt with scenes from the life of the urban poor as part of the social movement literature in his collection \\"Lirika\\" (Poetry, 1931), \\"Spasena svijetla\\" (Saved World, 1938). He achieved great popularity in the wider reading circles. *Dragutin Domjaniƒá wrote romantic poetry about spiritual love and the nobles and cavaliers of the days gone by. \\"Kipci i popevke\\" (Statuettes and pop songs, 1917), \\"Po dragomu kraju\\" (\\"Through the region\\", 1933) *Ulderiko Donadini was a versatile author, writing poems, novels and essays. A follower of Mato≈°'s symbolist- impressionist poetics, he was impressed by Dostoyevsky, and his works combine the spirit of the grotesque with some extremely neurotic characters. He published the collection \\"Lude priƒçe\\" (Crazy Stories, 1915), a series of novels \\"Vijavice\\" (Whirlwind, 1917), \\"Kroz ≈°ibe\\" (Through the brush, 1921), \\"Bauk\\" (Bogeyman, 1922), dramas \\"Bezdan\\" (The Abyss, 1919), \\"Igraƒçka oluje\\" (Toy storm, 1921). Gogoljeva smrt (\\"Gogol's death\\", 1921). *Viktor Car Emin wrote numerous novels and stories deal with economic-social and political problems of the past and the present of Istria. \\"Nove borbe\\" (New Struggle, 1926), \\"Vitez Mora\\" (Hero of the Sea, 1939). He dealt with the same topics in his works for the theatre. *August Cesarec was a versatile author, a poet, novelist, playwright, and political publicist. Politically he belonged to the Leninist left, he was passionately engaged in social controversies. The expressionist style of his early poetry and prose was gradually replaced by a more critical realism as he addressed issues such as the Croatian national identity and social injustice \\"Careva kraljevina\\" (The Emperor's Kingdom, 1925), \\"Zlatni mladiƒá\\" (Golden Youth, 1928), \\"Bjegunci\\" (Fugitives, 1933). *Milutin Cihlar Nehajev was a journalist, novelist and dramatist. \\"Veliki grad\\" (Big City, 1919), \\"Vuci\\" (Wolves, 1928) *Vjekoslav Kaleb depicted the environment and people of the Dalmatian hinterland with a sparse expressionist style in his novels \\"Na kamenju\\" (On the Rock, 1940), and \\"Izvan stvari\\" (Outside of Things, 1942). *Slavko Kolar analyzed life in Croatian villages and provinces with a remarkable humour. His best series of novels were \\"Ili jesmo ili nismo\\" (Either we are or not, 1933) and \\"Mi smo za pravicu\\" (We are for justice, 1936) explored the fate of characters who live in conditions of total deprivation, satirizing provincial intelligence and bureaucracy, particularly political careerism and opportunism. *Although the first collection of poems of Gustav Krklec (1899‚Äì1977) had the expressionist elements (Lirika \\"Poetry\\", 1919; \\"Srebrna cesta\\" (Silver Road, 1921), his poetic sensibility was more suited to traditionalist, impressionistic expression and linked verse \\"Izlet u nebo\\"(Trip to Heaven, 1928;\\"Darovi za Bezimenu\\" (Gifts for nameless, 1942). His wit is especially prominent in epigrams and pamphlets. *Josip Kosor was a novelist and playwright. Starting with novels depicting peasant life in Dalmatia, he evolved into a dramatist, being nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times. His plays Passion's Furnace (1912), The Invincible Ship (1921) and Reconciliation were translated for performance in England. Other works include \\"≈Ωena\\" (Woman, 1920), \\"Razvrat\\" (Debauchery, 1923), \\"Miris zemlje i mora\\" ( Scent of Earth and Sea, 1925) *Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá, a poet, storyteller, critic and journalist, was an advocate of HSS politics and a follower of Stjepan Radiƒá. In an early novel \\"Dani gnjeva\\" (Days of Anger, 1936), he wrote about his native Lukovdol, poetizing the harmony of nature and man, critically treating social injustice. In the poems, published in the posthumous book \\"Ognji i ro≈æe\\" (Fire and Roses, 1945), he uses dialect to depict the arkadian landscapes of his native country. He achieved exceptional expression in his best-known poem \\"Jama\\" (The Pit, 1944) a strong work of universal artistic value, a shocking testimony of war crime. *Ivo Kozarƒçanin, poet, critic and novelist, reached his artistic peak in the novels \\"Tuƒëa ≈æena\\" (Someone else's wife, 1937) and, especially, \\"Sam ƒçovjek\\" (Man alone, 1937), dealing with the psychological analysis of neurotic characters struggling to adapt to everyday life. His poems are interspersed with intense eroticism and an intense feeling of loneliness \\"Mrtve oƒçi\\" (Dead Eyes, 1938). *Miroslav Krle≈æa played a central role in literary life between the two world wars, based not only on his extensive output but also in having a wider public engagement driven by the magazines he published and his contributions to debates on cultural and political issues. His influence and popularity among the younger intellectuals can be seen in the number of his followers, known as the krle≈æijanci. During the First World War, he wrote a series of avant-garde dramas called \\"Kraljevo\\" (King), \\"Kristofor Kolumbo\\" (Christopher Columbus), \\"Michelangelo Buonarroti\\" (Michelangelo) and poetry based on free verse and expressive imagery \\"Three Symphonies\\", 1917; \\"Songs I\\" and \\"Songs II\\", 1918; \\"Songs III\\" and \\"Lirika\\" (Poetry, 1919). In the period after World War I, he published an anti-war novel in the series \\"Croatian God Mars\\". In the second half of the 1920s, in the Glembay cycle (drama \\"In agony\\", \\"Glembays,\\" \\"Leda\\") he analyzed the crisis of consciousness of the civic class using psychological realism. In the novels \\"The Return of Philip Latinowicz\\" (1932) and \\"The Edge of Reason\\" (1938), he dealt with the fate of a sensitive individual confronted with the social environment, and \\"Banquet in Blitva\\" (I., 1938, II., 1939), explored the conflict between an individual and despotic political authorities. By reviving the language of old Kajkavian literature, in \\"Balade Petrice Kerempuha\\" (1936) he created a complex picture of Croatian history. He also published a series of essay books, travelogues and controversies, which had a great deal of public acclaim. *Vjekoslav Majer is a poet of Zagreb scenes, close to Mato≈°, depicting the everyday life of the small man with social sensitivity and warm humour. Poetry collections \\"Lirika\\" (Poetry, 1924) and \\"Pjesme zabrinutog Evropejca\\" (Songs of a Worried European, 1934). Prose \\"Iz dnevnika malog Perice\\" (From the diary of little Perica, 1935), \\"Pepiƒá u vremenu i prostoru\\" (Pepiƒá in time and space, 1935‚Äì38), \\"≈Ωivot pu≈æa\\" (Life of a snail, 1938), \\"Dnevnik Oƒçena≈°eka\\" (Diary of Oƒçena≈°eka, 1938). *Milan Marjanoviƒá \\"Vladimir Nazor kao nacionalni pjesnik\\" (Vladimir Nazor as National Poet, 1923), \\"Stjepan Radiƒá\\" (Stjepan Radic, 1937), \\"Mi budale\\" (We Fools, 1939) *Vladimir Nazor \\"Arkun\\" (1920), \\"Niza od koralja\\" (String of Coral, 1922), \\"Nove priƒçe\\" (New Tales, 1922‚Äì26), \\"Priƒçe s ostrva, iz grada i sa planine\\", \\"Tales from island, city and mountain, 1927), \\"Pjesme moje mladosti\\" (Songs of my youth, 1930), \\"Fantazije i groteske\\" (Fantasies and grotesque, 1931). *Ante Tresiƒá Paviƒçiƒá \\"Govori i pisma iz ere u≈æasa i osloboƒëenja\\" (Speeches and letters from a time of exile and liberation, 1922), \\"Ivan Me≈°troviƒá\\" (Ivan Mestroviƒá, 1925), \\"Plavo cvijeƒáe\\" Blue Flowers, 1928) *ƒêuro Sudeta wrote melancholy verses imbued with Christian spirituality in his collections \\"Osamljene staze\\" (Lonely Tracks, 1924), and \\"Kuƒáice u dolu\\" (Houses in the Valley, 1926) in which he dealt with his own childhood, loneliness and foreboding imminent death. One of his best-known works is the fantasy narrative \\"Mor\\" (1930). *Ksaver ≈†andor Gjalski \\"Ljubav lajtnanta Miliƒáa\\" (The Love of Lieutenant Miliƒá, 1923), \\"Pronevjereni ideali\\" (Betrayed Ideals, 1925). *In his short life Antun Branko ≈†imiƒá wrote one of the most outstanding poetic and critical-essay works of Croatian literature. Initially writing impressionist poetry using symbolism and German Expressionism, he achieved his best work in poems written in stark verse, with no verbal ornamentation, about the transience of the human body and the life of the poor. During his lifetime he published a collection \\"Preobra≈æenja\\" (Transfiguration, 1920) and posthumously Izabrane pjesme (Selected Poems, 1933). He criticized the radical rejection of Croatian classics (Preradoviƒá, Vidriƒá, Vojnoviƒá, Nazor), but also the younger contemporaries (Andriƒá, Krle≈æa). *Dinko ≈†imunoviƒá spent most of his life in the hinterland of Dalmatia, writing many stories and two novels dealing with people from his native region. \\"Mladost\\" (Youth, 1921), \\"Porodica Vinƒçiƒá\\" (Vinƒçiƒá Family, 1923). *Nikola ≈†op's poetry was imbued with a profound spirituality, depicting love for the world of ordinary, small people, the poor and vagrants. He introduced a Jesus character into the everyday life of a small man \\"Pjesme siroma≈°nog sina\\" (Poems of the Poor Son, 1926), \\"Isus i moja sjena\\" (Jesus and My Shadow, 1934), \\"Za kasnim stolom\\" (For the Late Table, 1943). In his later poems, he left the topic of earthly joy and dealt with the symbolism of astral spaces. *Dragutin Tadijanoviƒá dealt with themes of lost childhood, employing a simplicity of language and intentionally naive views evocative of the subject. \\"Lirika\\" (Poetry, 1931), \\"Sunce nad oranicama\\" (Sun over the fields, 1933), \\"Pepeo srca\\" (Ashes of the heart, 1936), \\"Dani djetinjstva\\" (Days of Childhood, 1937), and \\"Tuga zemlje\\" (Sadness of the Earth, 1942). *Leading peacetime poet Tin Ujeviƒá began his career in 1914, with his contributions to the anthology \\"Hrvatska mlada lirika\\" (Croatian Young Lyrics). In the period around World War I, he was politically engaged as a Yugoslav nationalist, but after the war became disillusioned, leaving politics to devote himself to literature as a professional writer and translator. In addition to poetry, he wrote short stories, essays on foreign and domestic writers, prose, and newspaper articles. In his early poetry, he was close to Mato≈°, later taking inspiration from Baudelaire, Rimbaud and Whitman. Like other contemporary poets, he made use of highly-stylized folk tales, creating emotional expressions of personal tragedy, loneliness and intense passionate love, especially in \\"Lelek sebra\\" (Cry of Silver, 1920), and \\"Kolajna\\" (Medals, 1926). His later poems \\"Auto na korzu\\" (Car on the promenade, 1932), apart from the surrealist imagery, is also distinguished by the philosophy reflexivity. A representative collection of his poetry \\"Ojaƒëeno zvono\\" (Stolen Bell, 1933), a selection of erudite essays and pamphlets \\"Ljudi za vratima gostionice\\" (People at the inn door, 1938) and \\"Skalpel kaosa\\" (Scalpel chaos, 1938) established Ujeviƒá as an outstanding poet of the interwar years. Modern literature post Second World War = Post-war political changes = Literary life in the years immediately after the Second World War was marked by change: following the collapse of the Ustasha government, many writers went into exile. Those who had held high office in the NDH were put on trial, and Mile Budak was sentenced to death as a war criminal. Within the Croatian Writers' Association, radical changes took place, with some members temporarily banned from publication. Those who had been involved in the partisan movement now took on a leading role. The journal \\"Republika\\" (Republic, 1945) was launched, intended as the new central platform of literary life. Leading leftist writer, Miroslav Krle≈æa, who had not been active in the partisans due to a disagreement with the Communist Party leadership, gradually became re-engaged in public life. His role was considerably strengthened following Yugoslavia's break with Stalin, and in 1950, he founded the \\"Leksikografski zavod FNRJ\\" (known today as the Miroslav Krle≈æa Institute of Lexicography) in Zagreb. = Socialist Realism = In those first years after the war, socialist realism dominated across all fields of the arts. Agitprop (political propaganda) had a great influence on literary output, and on cultural life in general. In this, some of the leading writers of the partisans were active. Social realism writing left its mark in criticism and essays, although novels were rare. In the immediate post-war years, poetry was particularly popular, for example Marin Franiƒçeviƒá‚Äôs \\"Govorenje Mikule Trudnega\\" (Speaking of Mikula Trudneg), Vladimir Popoviƒá‚Äôs \\"Oƒçi\\" (Eyes), Jure Ka≈°telan's \\"Tifusari\\" (Tifusari), ≈Ωivko Jeliƒçiƒá‚Äôs \\"Koliba u inju\\" (Hut in Inja), Oto ≈†olc's, \\"Noƒá\\" (Night). Common themes were the uprising of the Croatians, and peasants against social injustice. Also popular were collections of stories about the Partisan War (Ivan Donƒçeviƒá \\"Bezimeni\\" (No name), Jo≈æa Horvat \\"Za pobjedu\\" (For victory), and Vjekoslav Kaleb \\"Brigada\\" (Brigade), and plays that had first been performed at partisan events during the war. Works published outside the social realist genre, included novels by Petar ≈†egedin \\"Djeca bo≈æja\\" (Children of God, 1946) and \\"Osamljenici\\" (Recluse, 1947), the poems of Vesna Parun \\"Zore i vihori\\" (Dawn and Whirlwinds, 1947), short stories by Ranko Marinkoviƒá \\"Proze\\" (Prose, 1948), the novel of Vladan Desnica \\"Zimsko ljetovanje\\" (Winter Holidays, 1950). In 1945, Ivo Andric published three novels that were to bring him world acclaim: \\"Na Drini ƒáuprija‚Äù (Bridge on the Drina), ‚ÄúTravniƒçka hronika‚Äù (Grass Chronicles) and \\"Gospoƒëica‚Äú(Maiden). = √âmigr√© writers = Meanwhile, √âmigr√© writers in Argentina got together to revive the Matica hrvatska journal that had been banned in Croatia by the communist authotities. Franjo Nevistiƒá and Vinko Nikoliƒá in Buenos Aires launched a half-monthly \\"Hrvatska\\" (Croatia), while Nikoliƒá and Antun Bonifaƒçiƒá founded the \\"Hrvatska revija\\" (Croatian review, 1951‚Äì1966 in Buenos Aires, 1966‚Äì1991 in Paris, Munich and Barcelona). Notable contributors included: Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, Mate Me≈°troviƒá, Eugen Dido Kvaternik, Bogdan Radica, Milan Bla≈æekoviƒá, Franjo Kuhariƒá, Dominik Mandiƒá, Rajmund Kupareo, Ante Ciliga, Vladko Maƒçek, D≈æafer Kulenoviƒá, Alija Nametak, Asaf Durakoviƒá, Saviƒá Markoviƒá ≈†tedimlija, and Franjo Tuƒëman. In Argentina also, Krle≈æa's former colleague from the journal \\"Peƒçata\\" (Stamp), Viktor Vida (1913‚Äì60), wrote books influenced by Italian hermeticism, which have been published in Croatia since the early 1970s. =Increasing freedom of expression= At the start of the 1950s, following the break of the Yugoslav leadership with Stalin, the rigid pressure of ideology in literature was gradually lifted. This freedom of expression was marked in 1952 by Krle≈æa in his speech at the III Congress of the Yugoslav Writers' Union in Ljubljana. He announced the birth of a new era, one that allowed freedom of choice for expressive means, an opening up to western influences and a somewhat more open treatment of literary themes (not permitted was any criticism of the political system, the Communist government and Josip Broz Tito himself). A number of writers began to establish the character of Croatian literature for the second half of the 20th Century. Petar ≈†egedin was a writer of highly intellectual fiction; the best-known of which is the so-called \\"existentialist trilogy\\", which forms part of the novels \\"Crni smije≈°ak\\" (Black Smile, 1969). He also published a series of short stories, novels, essays and travel books, his essays challenging the Croatian national question \\"Svi smo mi odgovorni\\" (We are all responsible, 1971). Vladan Desnica published four collections of novels, which are usually classified into two thematic series: realistic concepts of the Dalmatian environment, and maternally structured meditative prose. His work culminated in some of the best Croatian prose, the modernist concept of the \\"Proljeƒáa Ivana Galeba‚Äù (The Spring of John Seagull, 1957), a series of essays in which he addressed the issue of artistic creation. Ranko Marinkoviƒá is representative of Croatian modernist authors. Writing with a virtuoso style, his work is marked by a refined irony. He dealt with the conflict of a sensitive individual in middle age, unable to achieve an authentic identity. A versatile writer, he tried his hand at different genres; as a novelist \\"Ruke\\" (Hands, 1953), a dramatist \\"Glorija\\" (Gloria, 1956), a novelist \\"Kiklop\\" (Cyclops, 1965), and essayist \\"Geste i Grimase\\" (Gestures and Grimaces, 1951). Vesna Parun is the author of some fifty collections of poetry, and a book of prose and drama. Her love poetry is characterised by its attenuated sensuality and lush depictions of nature. In her later collections, she developed a tendency towards satire. Jure Ka≈°telan was a poet who depicted themes of childhood and homeland, combining Ujeviƒá-Mato≈°eviƒá traditions with oral poetry and surrealistic imagery. Poet and dramatist Radovan Iv≈°iƒá wrote surrealist works that are considered early forerunners of 1970s surrealism. Surrealist elements also appeared in the poetry of ≈†ime Vuƒçetiƒá, whose work was primarily focused on his own inner struggles and delusions. The poetry of Drago Ivani≈°eviƒá initially showed influences of surrealism and Italian hermeticism, later writing in more personal style in his chakavian verses of the 1970s. Poet Marin Franiƒçeviƒá wrote socially engaged verses in the chakavian dialect, later turning to intimate landscape motifs. Jure Franiƒçeviƒá Ploƒçar wrote poetry in the ƒçakav and ≈†tokav dialects, but established himself primarily as a novelist, with a series of books about the NOB period, written without sentiment, based on the complex psychological states of the characters. Jo≈æa Horvat dealt with war themes in humorous narratives, while his later works dealt with his own obsession with nature, hunting and adventure sailing. Mirko Bo≈æiƒá is best known for his \\"Kurlan\\" novel trilogy depicting the life of the poor in the Dalmatian hinterland, with a keen sense of character portrayal in an expressive style based on the local stokavian dialect enriched with invented expressions. He also distinguished himself as a playwright. Pero Budak was the author of several dramas about rural life in Lika, with a pronounced comic touch, very popular in the 1950s. ≈Ωivko Jeliƒçiƒá wrote a series of short stories and novels in a modernist narrative structure. Ivan Raos was a prolific writer of short-stories, novelist and playwright, in a variety of styles from humour mixed with realistic narrative, to modernist experimentation. Vojin Jeliƒá dealt with themes of life in the Knin district, using a modernist narrative. Marijan Matkoviƒá was best-known as a playwright, whose best works are considered to be his dramatic texts with historical themes. =Krugovi (Circles) group= During the 1950s, the journal \\"Krugovi\\" (Circles, 1952‚Äì58) played a major role in the development of Croatian literature, led by a group of young writers born around 1930. Together they counteracted the policies of socialist realism and opened the door to wide-ranging influences from the rest of the world, from surrealism, Russian avant-gardists, existentialism to American so-called hard-boiled prose. Their ironic style was a symptom of post-war optimism fading, most likely influenced by American novelists and critics, who saw a basic poetic quality in irony. Among the writers of this generation, the most significant prose was written by Slobodan Novak, in his collections \\"Izgubljeni zaviƒçaj\\" (Lost Homeland, 1955), \\"Tvrdi grad\\" (Hard City, 1961), \\"Izvanbrodski dnevnik\\" (Outboard Diary, 1977) and the novel \\"Mirisi, zlato i tamjan\\" (Scents, Gold and Incense, 1968) in which he dealt with the dilemmas of the modern intellectual, with a sense of existential absurdity. Novak demonstrates a distinct sense of psychological shading in his characters and a sophisticated imaging of the native Mediterranean ambience. Slavko Mihaliƒá, was a leading poet of the Circles group, author of twenty collections of poetry, beginning with \\"Komorne muzike\\" (Chamber Music, 1954). He was preoccupied with the idea of human loss, and the struggle to achieve an authentic existence, which he portrayed in a series of semantically layered images. Ivan Slamnig, was the author of numerous collections of poetry \\"Aleja poslije sveƒçanosti\\" (Alley after the ceremony, 1956), \\"Odron\\" (Landslide, 1956), \\"Naronska siesta\\" (Narona siesta, 1963), the novel \\"Bolja polovica hrabrosti\\" (Better half of courage, 1972), collections of short stories, radio drama, was prone to puns and irony, and his poetry is full of intellectual references. Antun ≈†oljan was a versatile author: a poet, novelist \\"Izdajice‚Äù (Traitor, 1961), \\"Kratki izlet‚Äù (Short trip, 1965), \\"Luka‚Äù (Port, 1974), playwright, critic, feuilletonist, anthologist, editor of several journals and translator. Knowledgeable about current trends in world literature, he produced a modernist poetry version of myths and legends, rewriting classical motifs and forms. Milivoj Slaviƒçek was another extremely prolific poet, using everyday expressions to describe seemingly small things,imbuing scenes of ordinary life with elements of lyrical meditation. Irena Vrkljan was also a poet inspired by surrealism, whose greatest success was achieved in her 1980s confessional, feminist inspired novel. The poetry of Vesna Krmpotiƒá was concerned with a search for the mystical symbols of life. Vlado Gotovac was characterized by a highly intellectual type of writing, critics often called him the \\"philosophical poet\\". He was close to the upcoming generation of new writers in the 1960s, as editor of the \\"Hrvatskog tjednika\\" (Croatian Weekly), a cult publication in the period of the Croatian Spring. He passionately advocated the idea of liberal democracy and Croatian national emancipation. Ivan Ku≈°an wrote stories for children with the main character a boy called Kok. He also wrote some notable works for adults; prose and drama based on his linguistic and stylistic virtuosity and wit that occasionally become happy pastiches of literary stereotypes from domestic and world literature. Other authors of children's literature include Zvonimir Balog, Sunƒçana ≈†krinjariƒá, Nada Iveljiƒá and Vi≈°nja Stahuljak. Predrag Matvejeviƒá explores the tradition of the leftist literature and polemically analyzes current issues of cult politic. He achieved international success with the lexicographical work \\"Mediteranski brevijar\\" (Mediterranean Breviary, 1987). He produced at the end of the 1970s a series of historical novels inspired by the phrases and themes of old travel books and chronicles, folk literature and Ivo Andriƒá‚Äôs narrative technique. In the 1990s he wrote books in which he confronted the opponents of HDZ policy. =Razlog (Reason) group= In the early 1960s, the magazine \\"Razlog\\" (Reason, 1961‚Äì68) and the associated library featured writers born mainly around 1940, characterized by a pronounced awareness of generational and aesthetic distinctiveness from other groups within Croatian literature. Reason's authors typically relied on philosophical discourse (so the group included somewhat older, more philosophical writers such as Vlado Gotovac, Bruno Popoviƒá, Branislav Zeljkoviƒá) and initially were strongly influenced by Heidegger and the French existentialists, and by the late 1960s also by structuralist ideas. They tended to write more criticism and poetry, as opposed to longer prose forms. \\"Reason\\" critiques were not only concerned with literature, but attempted to interpret the phenomenon of art altogether. Boundaries between poetry and essays were removed: their favorite form of poetry was in prose, using themes derived from modern or analysis of the process of artistic creation, or the phenomenon of literacy. One of the key exponents was Zvonimir Mrkonjiƒá, who began in the 1960s as a poet, relying on the experience of European, particularly French modernism. He was significant as a critic and anthologist, seeking to reinterpret ideas about post-war Croatian poetry, affirming some previously neglected early modernists (Radovan Iv≈°iƒá, Josip Sto≈°iƒá ) and writers who built autonomous poetic worlds, especially Nikola ≈†op. Danijel Dragojeviƒá is considered one of the most important Croatian writers today, influencing generations of Croatian authors with his lyrics, poems, distinctive style and uncompromising attitude. He is the twin brother of writer Ivan Dragojeviƒá. Poet Ante Stamaƒá used more traditional, classical forms than most of the Reason writers, and is associated with existential poetry. Igor Zidiƒá writes his poetry in compact, elliptical, clean statements, while Dubravko Horvatiƒá developed a form of poetry in prose. Novelist and essayist Milan Miriƒá was also part of the Razlog generation. Although very productive in poetry and criticism, the Reason group left no major prose works. Nedjeljko Fabrio is one of the few writers (also playwright, essayist and translator), whose writing displays a certain kinship with the group. In the 1980s, he had great success with two thematically- related historical novels: \\"Vje≈æbanje ≈æivota‚Äù (Practice of life, 1985) and \\"Berenikina kosa‚Äù (Berenice's Hair, 1989). Mate Raos was an early writer of fantasy fiction that would become popular in later years. Tomislav Slavica wrote modernist-style prose organized with a strong allegorical and symbolic component. Jozo Lau≈°iƒá dealt with subjects related to Dalmatian Hinterland in his series of novels. =Drama and verse= Slobodan ≈†najder At the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, a number of remarkable dramatists appeared in Croatian literature. Ivo Bre≈°an is the author of a large number of plays marked by language interplay and the grotesque; his drama \\"Predstava Hamleta u selu Mrdu≈°a Donja\\" (Hamlet performance in the village of Mrdu≈°a Donja, first performed in 1971) is the most influential Croatian drama in the second half of the 20th century. He is also a successful novelist and screenwriter. Slobodan ≈†najder relies on the poetics of the avant-garde theatre of the 1960s and on Krle≈æa's heritage. Other dramatic writers were Tomislav Bakariƒá, Ivan Bakmaz and Slobodan ≈†embera. Dubravko Jelaƒçiƒá Bu≈æimski writes drama, novels and prose for children. Boris Senker, Nino ≈†krabe and Tahir Mujiƒçiƒá together wrote a number of comedies. Branimir Bo≈°njak uses post-structuralist settings in his essays while his poetry evokes existential concepts. The poetry of Goran Babiƒá characterized by an interest in the dark side of human existence. His themes range in tone and imagination from ancient legends to extravagant confessionals. Marija Peakiƒá Mikuljan's poetry is taken up with themes of falling, disappearing, and dying, along with a preoccupation with the musicality of the verse. Stijepo Mijoviƒá Koƒçan writes poetry of heterogeneous expression: ranging from modernist experiments to patterns of poetry. Jasna Melvinger writes intimate poetry with an elegance and introspection. Luko Paljetak is a leading poet in various forms, his work is distinguished by its thoughtfulness, musicality of verse, and the effective conflict of feeling and irony. Borben Vladoviƒá is one of the best representatives of visual poetry in Croatia. Among the many poets who published their first books at the end of the 1960s, and early 1970s, were Ernest Fi≈°er, ≈Ωeljko Kne≈æeviƒá, Mario Su≈°ko, Gojko Su≈°ac, Jordan Jeliƒá, Dubravka Oraiƒá-Toliƒá, Ivan Rogiƒá Nehajev, Andriana ≈†kunca, Vladimir Reinhofer, Nikola Martiƒá, Ivan Kordiƒá, Jak≈°a Fiamengo, Momƒçilo Popadiƒá, Enes Ki≈°eviƒá, Tomislav Marijan Bilosniƒá, D≈æemaludin Aliƒá, Stjepan ≈†e≈°elj, Sonja Manojloviƒá, Mile Pe≈°orda, Tomislav Matijeviƒá, Bo≈æica Jelu≈°iƒá, ≈Ωeljko Ivankoviƒá, Dra≈æen Katunariƒá, and Mile Stojiƒá. =Modern Croatian prose= The new generation of authors in the early 1970s had a fondness for fantasy, and were inspired by contemporary Latin American fiction, Russian symbolism and avant-garde (especially Bulgakov), then Kafka, Schulz, Calvino, and Singer. There was renewed interest for writing fiction, especially modern Croatian prose. Structural form became important, the act of literary creation was very often the theme, and quotations from Croatia's literary heritage often appeared. Towards the end of the 1970s many writers were integrating so-called trivial genres (detective stories, melodrama) into high literature, while others were writing socially critical prose, for example romance thrust into novels, which was popular in the 1970s. Pavao Pavliƒçiƒá Nenad ≈†epiƒá and Albert Goldstein with their fantasy novels, led the generation of writers born after the Second World War. Stjepan ƒåuiƒá in his early work \\"Staljinova slika i druge priƒçe\\" (Stalin's Picture and Other Stories, 1971), intertwined fantasy and allegorical narrative dealing with the individual's relationship with a totalitarian political system. Pavao Pavliƒçiƒá is a prolific writer, screenwriter, literary historian and theorist. He started as a fantasist willing to experiment, then went on to write a series of novels, mainly detective fiction. Goran Tribuson, initially wrote an erudite type of fantasy prose, followed by a series of novels and short stories in which he nostalgically evokes the mythology of the sixty-four generation. He also writes detective fiction and screenplays. The writing of Dubravka Ugre≈°iƒá makes extensive use of quotations from classics as well as from popular literature. In the 1990s, her novels and books of political essays received several prestigious awards. Veljko Barbieri writes fiction related to the Mediterranean atmosphere, using quotations from classical Greek and Roman literature. Pero Kvesiƒá writes so-called \\"jeans\\" prose with themes from the life of city youth, shaped into an urban colloquial style. Slavenka Drakuliƒá writes novels and essays sparked by a feminist spirit, and which have been published worldwide. In the mid-1980s in the journal \\"Quorum\\" a series of new prose writers, poets and critics appeared: Damir Milo≈°, Ljiljana Domiƒá, Branko ƒåegec, Kre≈°imir Bagiƒá, Vlaho Bogi≈°iƒá, Hrvoje Pejakoviƒá, Edo Budi≈°a, Julijana Matanoviƒá, Goran Rem, Delimir Re≈°icki, Miroslav Miƒáanoviƒá, Milo≈° ƒêurƒëeviƒá, Nikola Petkoviƒá and several young dramatic writers, such as Borislav Vujƒçiƒá, Miro Gavran, Lada Ka≈°telan, Ivan Vidiƒá, and Asja Srnec-Todoroviƒá. =Croatian War of Independence= Croatian War of Independence of 1991‚Äì95 had its echoes in literary works. Many writers were employed in support of Croatian independence and territorial integrity. Popular genres were patriotic columns and newspaper reports of the war. An anthology of patriotic poetry was published \\"U ovom stra≈°nom ƒçasu\\" (In this Terrible Time\\", 1992, edited by Ivo Sanader and Ante Stamaƒá), and a representative collection of the wartime literary output was issued under \\"Hrvatsko ratno pismo\\" (Croatian war letters\\", 1992, edited by Dubravka Oraiƒá Toliƒá). During that period many Croatian emigrant writers returned to Croatia. Nikoliƒá transferred the location of his \\"Hrvatske revije\\" (Croatian Review) to the country. Of the returning authors, Boris Maruna was best integrated into the mainstream of contemporary Croatian literature. In contrast, other writers such as Dubravka Ugre≈°iƒá, Slavenka Drakuliƒá, Predrag Matvejeviƒá, Slobodan ≈†najder, and Rada Ivekoviƒá continued their literary activity abroad. The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina also brought several Croatian writers from Sarajevo to Zagreb, among which were Miljenko Jergoviƒá, author of one of the best novels about the war in the former Yugoslavia \\"Sarajevski Marlboro\\" (Sarajevo Marlboro, 1994), Ivan Lovrenoviƒá \\"Liber memorabilium\\", 1994), Jozefina Dautbegoviƒá, and Darko Lukiƒá. Some prominent Serbian writers moved to Croatia and began writing in the Croatian language, for example Mirko Kovaƒç and Bora ƒÜosiƒá. =Festival of Alternative Literature= In 1990, a group of writers launched the \\"Festival alternativne knji≈æevnosti\\" (FAK, Festival of Alternative Literature), an event for the public reading of literary works. Although initially emphasizing their mutual differences, most were characterized by a tendency towards neorealist poetry using a contemporary urban vocabulary. They were concerned about the lives of young people in a traumatized post-war Croatia, and were critical of nationalistic myths. Among them were Zoran Feriƒá, Miljenko Jergoviƒá, Ante Tomiƒá, Jurica Paviƒçiƒá, and Robert Peri≈°iƒá. =Literature studies= The study of literature in Croatia in the mid-1950s put aside the previous social-realist ideology, and developed into a more objective analytical form. In 1957 the journal \\"Umjetnost rijeƒçi\\" (Art of Words) was launched, collecting together a group of theoeticians and literary historians who would form the core of the \\"Zagrebaƒçke stilistiƒçke ≈°kole\\" (Zagreb stylistic school). That was followed by the magazine \\"Knji≈æevna smotra\\" (Literary Festival, 1969) and \\"Croatica\\" (1970). During the second half of the 20th century, scholars in the field of Croatian literary studies included: Maja Bo≈°koviƒá-Stulli, Viktor ≈Ωmegaƒç, Darko Suvin, Milivoj Solar, Radoslav Katiƒçiƒá, Pavao Pavliƒçiƒá, Andrea Zlatar.

It was directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Danny Cheng, also known as Scud. The film explores several themes traditionally regarded as 'taboo' in Hong Kong society, in an unusually open, convention-defying way, and features full- frontal male nudity in several scenes. It is the second of seven publicly released films by Scud. Plot The film explores the near true-life story of a young Chinese man (said to be a semi-autobiography of the film's writer/producer), who seeks a long-term relationship with a straight friend. The friend is aware of his inclination, and is happy to befriend him, but is very reluctant to express open affection for him or to become emotionally involved. Production Permanent Residence examines the limit of life, and is the first of a trilogy: the second, called Amphetamine, examines the limits of passion, while the third, known as Life of an Artist, examines the limits of art. Amphetamine was screened at the Berlin International Film Festival on 15 February 2010, and was also shown at the Hong Kong International Film Festival on 6 April 2010. The third film, Life of an Artist, has not yet been released. In the album book that accompanies the film, the director, Scud appears naked as he replaces Sean Li in the photos in an attempt to emphasize the semi-autobiographical nature of the film. Publicity videos accompanying the film also feature the full-frontal nudity of famous Hong Kong model Byron Pang, who was a contestant in the Mr. Hong Kong 2005 contest, and the film's director ('Scud'), himself. The film was said by critics to be both insightful and mournful as it reflects on the fleeting nature of love and mortality.

It was nominated for two BAFTA awards. Plot Bill Forrester (Gregory Peck), a RCAF pilot serving in the Royal Air Force in Burma, pilots a de Havilland Mosquito, a two-seat fighter-bomber. Forrester is emotionally distraught after losing his new wife in the Blitz in London and has become self destructive, seeking to end his life in action. His reckless conduct in action raises the concern of his commanding officer, because it needlessly endangers his flight crews, and others also become reluctant to fly with Forrester. The commander seeks to have him grounded. However it would require the approval of the base flight surgeon. The doctor agrees reluctantly to examine him, despite the fact that Forrester is highly decorated and the best pilot in the squadron. He seeks out Forrester and upon finding him, convinces him to visit a village where he is introduced to beautiful Burmese woman named Anna. They strike up a friendship and continue to see each other. During one their conversations, he tells Anna about the loss of his past wife and his desire to end his own life by dying in action; \\"You'd think that would be easy in a war\\", he explains to Anna, \\"but I just kept getting medals instead.\\" Anna and he begin to fall in love and with Anna's support, Bill begins to recover his emotional stability. Forrester is allowed to return to the air by flying a ferry mission. He and his new navigator Carrington (Lyndon Brook) are assigned to fly a routine non-combat flight to Meiktila. Their passenger is Flight Lieutenant Blore (Maurice Denham) who is riding in the Mosquito's bomb bay. During the flight an engine fire forces them down in a remote desert area of Burma's central plain, which is controlled by the Japanese. The soil on the desert plain and the surrounding hills have a purple hue, thus the name of the film. Carrington is injured during the crash landing. His leg is badly burned and he is unable to walk. Without supplies and very little water, Forrester decides their best chance for survival is to walk 30 miles to the nearest river, where they can get the much needed water. From there they would stand a better chance for rescue. Blore on the other hand, believes their best chance is to stay with the plane and wait for rescue, as search parties would surely be looking for them. Blore's hope is bolstered by sighting an airplane flying high overhead, on the same route they were on before the crash. Forrester points out that being spotted from such a great altitude is one in a million. Blore is convinced and decides to go with Forrester's plan. They build a stretcher for Carrington out of bamboo and set out for the river by walking at night and resting during the day. As the three men struggle to survive in the hostile environment, the self-destructive Forrester proves to be the one with the strongest will to live. His goal becomes the survival of the other two and seeing Anna again. During the trek, Blore, while carrying the stretcher from the front, slips and falls down a rocky slope. In the fall he breaks his collar bone and is badly skinned up. Unable to continue carrying the stretcher, and with the meager water supply dwindling, Forrester alters their plan. Blore must continue on to the river while Forrester stays with Carrington. Once there he can bring back water for the both of them. Blore once again objects and wants for all of them to return to the airplane. Forrester tells him to sleep on the suggestion and they can decide once they get some rest. Upon waking, Forrester discovers that Blore has gone, but he has left a canteen with some water in it. Forrester tells Carrington that he will go bring Blore back and leaves the canteen with him. He sets out to rescue Blore once again and without water, only to hear the gunshot of Blore committing suicide before he can catch up with him. Upon reaching him, he takes Blore's dog tags and the pistol. He also finds Blore's wallet with a picture of his family in it, a wife and two children. The irony of the moment is striking in that Blore, the one person that claimed to have the most to live for with a family and a profession back home, ended up being the one to lose all hope so quickly. Forrester gathers up his belongings and returns to Carrington. The two once again set out for the river, this time with Forrester carrying Carrington on his back. With very little water left and still many miles to go, Forrester is unable to walk any further and they collapse with exhaustion to the desert floor. Carrington convinces him that their only hope now is to take whatever water is left, and when Forrester reaches the river, to fill the canteen and bring it back. Forrester reluctantly agrees. Now alone and near complete exhaustion, Forrester struggles on through seemingly endless miles of scrub brush and parched desert plain. Near his limit of endurance he struggles up a hill and falls face down, unable to go any further. Upon finding some lost reserve of strength, he opens his eyes and hears the sound of water. He struggles over the crest of the hill and on the other side is a miracle. It is the river. The next scene is that of the people back at his home base hearing the news of their survival. Forrester has indeed returned with the water to Carrington, and now the two are headed back on a transport airplane. Upon landing Forrester says goodbye to Carrington who must stay on the plane which will take him to a hospital. Forrester, still weak from the ordeal, is greeted by the base doctor who upon giving him a quick examination, agrees to deliver him by jeep back to the waiting Anna. The final scene is that of Forrester finding Anna asleep in her bed. He lies down beside her without waking her up and falls promptly to sleep.

Courier. . is a sea shanty about a sailor who, once ashore, gets very drunk and loses all his clothing and hard-earned money when a prostitute steals them. Though he has sworn to never work at sea again, this situation forces him to accept a position on a whaling ship bound for the Arctic Sea, having to endure terrible conditions such as the freezing cold. The sailor's name varies slightly in the different versions of the song, though typically he is named Jack Tarr, Jack Sprat, or Jack Wrack. The song urges sailors to avoid strong drink and the hard lifestyle that comes with it, and to \\"get married instead\\". The exact origins of the song can be traced to the English Merchant Navy, likely from the 1700 - 1900 period. As with most traditional folk songs, different versions developed over the years. The Wolfe Tones released a version in 1970 under the title of \\"The Holy Ground\\" with modified melody and lyrics, which holds true to the themes of the original song. Irish artists such as Ryan's Fancy and The Dubliners recorded very faithful versions with the slightly modified title \\"Go to Sea No More\\", while other versions, such as the one recorded in the late 1960s by the American folk-rock band The Byrds on their Ballad of Easy Rider album, use the title \\"Jack Tarr the Sailor\\" while telling the same tale. A bluegrass version by Jerry Garcia and David Grisman was released in 1996 on their album Shady Grove under the title \\"Off to Sea Once More\\".

History  The present church was built adjacent to the now absent Convent of Nuestra Se√±ora del Favor (Our Lady of the Graces). It was built at the site of an oratory dedicated to St. Mark and Our Lady of the Graces, and founded in 1612 by Diego de Vera y Ord√≥√±ez de Villaqui√°n. Thirty two years later, the father Pl√°cido Mirto establishes a Convent of the Theatine Order. The church is dedicated to the founder of the order, Saint Cajetan of Thiene. In 1822, the remaining monks were moved to a convent in Zaragoza, and the convent, which had suffered depredations during the Napoleonic occupation of the peninsula, was ceded temporarily to the Franciscans of San Gil. In 1836, after the Desamortizaci√≥n de Mendiz√°bal, the convent building becomes private apartments. In 1869, the church is joined to the parish of the demolished Saint Mill√°n Abad (hence the current dedication of the church). On July 19, 1936, arson gutted all but the facade. In 1960, reconstruction began on the church. In 1980 San Cayetano was declared a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural by the Spanish government.  Description  Construction of the church began in 1669 by the architect Marcos L√≥pez. Work was continued by others, including likely Jos√© de Churriguera and Pedro de Ribera, and not completed till 1761 by Francisco de Moradillo. Moradillo's facade was built of granite, and features three arches. Over the arches are statues of San Cajetan, Our Lady of Grace, and San Andr√©s Avelino, by Pedro Alonso de los R√≠os.

Life Otto the Strict was born around 1266, the son of John of L√ºneburg (d. 1277) and Duchess Liutgard of Holstein. Otto was underage when his father died, so the administration of the duchy went initially to his uncle, Duke Albert (d 1279) and, after his death, to his uncle, Conrad I, Prince-Bishop of Verden. From 1282 Otto ruled in his own right. His rule was marked by several feuds, financed by pledges (Verpf√§ndungen), involving border and property disputes with his neighbours. Otto restricted the rights of the knights and safeguarded public order. The settlements of Harburg, Dahlenburg (1289) and Celle (1292) were given town rights.

The Church of Our Lady of Montserrat () is a Baroque-style, Roman Catholic church in central Madrid, Spain. Despite the imposing facade on Calle San Bernardo, the interior has relatively few bays because it was not possible to complete the building as originally projected.  History  It was founded by Philip IV to host the Castilian monks from the Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey (Catalonia) who came fleeing the Catalan Revolt. The Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey was the main Benedictine center of Catalonia and had belonged to the Castilian jurisdiction of Valladolid since 1493, when Ferdinand II of Aragon sent 14 monks from Valladolid and made the abbey dependent on the congregation of this Castilian city. The Catalan monks, were unhappy that their abbot was almost always Castilian, and took the opportunity of the Revolt to oust the Castilian monks. Work on the building did not begin until 1668, during the reign of Charles II, and was under the direction of Sebasti√°n Herrera Barnuevo. The finance for the construction was provided by the illustrious Baron of Gilet, in the Kingdom of Valencia, Pedro Arnaldo Llansol de Roman√≠, following his elevation to Marquis of Llansol in 1690. The facade is clearly somewhat influenced by the famous Church of the Ges√π of Vignola in Rome and is considered one of the most complex and elaborate buildings of the Madrilenian Baroque. Aspect of inside the temple. To compensate for the slope of the street, Herrera placed on a high base three narrow bodies with larger and smaller bodies pressed together. The pilasters are of Doric style, unfolding frequently. After the death of Herrera in 1671, Gaspar de la Pe√±a will continue with the work without finishing the chancel and the main facade. The works will be abandoned until 1716 that takes Pedro de Ribera at the beginning of his career. Ribera respected the initial facade although redecorated the door and windows. It can see the difference between windows of Herrera and of Ribera and comparing the classic window of the central attic with the rest, adorned with tufts, scallops and other Riberan elements. In the absence of the initial plans, it is unclear whether the two towers that were initially were contemplated, were due to Herrera. Anyway, its construction did not begin until 1729, starting with the tower of the side of the epistle, and in 1731 switched to lift the first body of the opposite side, concluding only the first in 1740. Characteristic work of the decorative dynamism of Pedro de Ribera topped with singular spire, giving the set the personality and harmony enough to enter in the history of Madrid's architecture. At its top is open on each side two semicircular windows flanked by striking estipites. The roof of the slate is crowned with a washer, a cap with a decorative bulb and the said spire, completed by a world globe with a cross.

In some cases, load balancing rather than raw speed may be the main goal; a Web server, for instance, could use Gearman to send tasks for which it is not optimized to another computer (which may be running on a different architecture, using another operating system, or loaded with a computer language better suited to a particular operation). It was originally written in Perl by Brad Fitzpatrick. Brian Aker and Eric Day rewrote the framework in C.  How Gearman Works  The Gearman Application Stack. Gearman assigns each involved computer a role as client, job server, or worker. A worker machine can be assigned multiple instances of the worker role, which allows more powerful computers to complete more portions of a given task. Tasks originate on a client, are transmitted from the client to the job server, and performed on one or more workers. The completed task's output is then returned, again by way of the job server, to the client where the task originated. Gearman is conceptually related to MapReduce; Gearman handles MapReduce by allowing worker nodes to map out work to other workers, with the original worker acting as the reducer. Gearman performs coalescence on the work sent by a client. If two or more clients ask for work to be completed on the same body of work, either by seeing that the same blocks are being sent or by using the unique value sent by the client, it will coalesce the work so that only one worker is used. It does this specifically to avoid thundering herd problems which are common to cache hit failures. To mitigate the damage that would be done if a job server (or its network connection) were to fail, clients can be configured with more than one assigned job server; if the first assigned job server fails, another can be transparently substituted. Gearman implements a protocol that consists of binary packets containing requests and responses; this protocol defines the structure of messages passing between the three parts of a Gearman implementation. By default, the Gearman protocol uses TCP port 4730. It previously operated on port 7003, but this conflicted with the AFS port range and the new port (4730) was assigned by IANA. The name \\"Gearman\\" was chosen as an anagram for \\"Manager\\", \\"since it dispatches jobs to be done, but does not do anything useful itself.\\"http://gearman.org/#introduction  Features  * Job retries * Round robin scheduling * Coalescence * Persistence storage via: ** libmemcached ** libdrizzle ** SQLite ** MySQL ** Postgres ** tokyocabinet ** Redis (unreleased - currently in development) ** MongoDB (unreleased - currently in development)  Implementations  * Gearmand, up to version 1.1.12 * Gearmand, from version 1.1.13 * java-gearman-service * Gearman::Server * TclGearman  Clients  Currently there are client libraries for C, Perl, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, .NET, JMS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle.Gearman page Client & Worker APIs  Similar software  * HAProxy * Squid * Varnish * Hipache * Tr√¶f…™k External links * http://danga.com/words/2007_06_usenix/usenix.pdf * http://gearman.org/documentation/ * http://gearman.org/download/ * http://lists.danga.com/pipermail/gearman/2008-April/000076.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20081209012837/http://krow.livejournal.com/628025.html * GearmanBundle for Symfony2 projects Citations Category:Application programming interfaces Category:Message-oriented middleware Category:Software using the BSD license ","title":"Gearman"},{"id":"23202014","title":"Let's Get Wet"},{"id":"23202016","text":"Edward Bullough (28 March 1880 ‚Äì 17 September 1934) was an English aesthetician and scholar of modern languages, who worked at the University of Cambridge. He did experimental work on the perception of colours, and in his theoretical work introduced the concept of psychical distance: that which \\"appears to lie between our own self and its affections\\" in aesthetic experience. In languages, Bullough was a dedicated teacher who published little. He came to concentrate on Italian, and was elected to the Chair of Italian at Cambridge in 1933. Life and work =Early life to \\"Psychical Distance,\\" 1880-1914= Edward Bullough was born in Thun, Switzerland, on 28 March 1880, to John Bullough and Bertha Schmidlin.F. E. Trayes, ed., Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College, vol. 5, Admissions from 1911 to 1932 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1948), 132. As a child he lived mostly in Germany, and was educated at Vitzthum Gymnasium, Dresden.M. O. [Michael Oakeshott], \\"Edward Bullough,\\" Caian 43, no. 1 (1934): 1. It was a convention at the time that articles in the Caian were signed with initials only. Oakeshott is identified in Elizabeth M. Wilkinson, introduction to Aesthetics, by Edward Bullough (London: Bowes and Bowes, 1957), xii. At seventeen Bullough moved to England,Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 1. and in 1899 matriculated from Trinity College in the University of Cambridge,W. W. Rouse Ball and J. A. Venn, eds., Admissions to Trinity College, Cambridge, vol. 5, 1851 to 1900 (London: Macmillan, 1913), 1134. where he studied Medieval and Modern Languages.Trayes, Biographical History of Caius, 132. He graduated BA (Class I) in 1902, MA in 1906,Ball and Venn, Admissions to Trinity, 1134. after which he taught French and German at Cambridge colleges and lectured in the university.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 2. At this time Bullough became interested in aesthetics, and \\"prepared himself to deal with [its] problems ‚Ä¶ by a study of physiology and general psychology\\".Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 2. See also Edward Bullough, Italian Perspectives (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1934), 8-9. In 1907 Bullough gave a course of lectures in aesthetics, the first such at Cambridge, privately printed as The Modern Conception of Aesthetics.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 2. Bullough mistakenly says the year was 1906 in Italian Perspectives, 8. The lectures are first announced, to begin on 14 October 1907, in the Cambridge University Reporter 37, no. 39 (1907): 1018. He repeated the course annually \\"until shortly before his death\\".Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 2. Bullough conducted experimental work on the perception of colours in the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, the basis for a series of three papers in the British Journal of Psychology: \\"The Apparent Heaviness of Colours\\" (1907), \\"The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Single Colours\\" (1908), and \\"The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Simple Colour-Combinations\\" (1910).Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 3. Bullough also had an interest in parapsychology, and was a member of the Society for Psychical Research.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 3. In 1908 Bullough married Enrichetta Angelica Marchetti (daughter of the actor Eleonora Duse), with whom he would have a son and a daughter.\\"Professor Bullough, Italian Studies at Cambridge,\\" The Times, 18 September 1934. He was elected to a Drosier Fellowship at Gonville and Caius College in 1912,Trayes, Biographical History of Caius, 132. and in the same year published his noted theoretical paper, Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle\\". Psychical distance (Bullough capitalises the words) is that which, in certain situations, \\"appears to lie between our own self and its affections, using the latter term in its broadest sense as anything which affects our being\\".Edward Bullough, Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle,\\" British Journal of Psychology 5, no. 2 (1912): 89. Artistic production and appreciation are two such situations.Bullough, \\"Psychical Distance,\\" 90. > [Psychical Distance] has a negative, inhibitory aspect‚Äîthe cutting-out of > the practical sides of things and of our practical attitude to them‚Äîand a > positive side‚Äîthe elaboration of the experience on the new basis created by > the inhibitory action of Distance.Bullough, \\"Psychical Distance,\\" 89. The relation between self and object remains a personal one (it is not like the impersonal relation in scientific observation, for example) and Bullough thinks that a \\"concordance\\" between them is necessary for aesthetic appreciation.Bullough, \\"Psychical Distance,\\" 91-92. However this must not be such that psychical distance is lost: Bullough imagines a jealous husband watching a performance of Othello, who \\"will probably do anything but appreciate the play\\".Bullough, \\"Psychical Distance,\\" 93. This \\"antinomy of Distance\\"Bullough, \\"Psychical Distance,\\" 92. leads Bullough to say that what is desirable in art, \\"both in appreciation and production\\", is \\"the utmost decrease of Distance without its disappearance\\".Bullough, \\"Psychical Distance,\\" 94. In the source, the second quotation is mostly italicised. =War service to death, 1915-1934= In the First World War, Bullough was recruited as a civilian in the summer of 1915 to the Admiralty's cryptoanalysis section, Room 40. He served for four years, finally as a Lieutenant of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 4. After the war he returned to Caius, where he had been re-elected to a fellowship in January 1915.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 4. He published in the British Journal of Psychology two more papers on aesthetic theory, \\"The Relation of Aesthetics to Psychology\\" (1919) and \\"Mind and Medium in Art\\" (1920), and a review of experimental work (1921).Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 3. In 1920, he was appointed College Lecturer in modern languages and University Lecturer in German,P. Giles, \\"Appointment of a University Lecturer in German,\\" Cambridge University Reporter 50, no. 31 (1920): 758. and he edited the anthology Cambridge Readings in Italian Literature.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 5. In 1923 Bullough resigned his university post,E. C. Pearce, \\"University Lectureship in German,\\" Cambridge University Reporter 53, no. 41 (1923): 1042. wishing to concentrate instead on Italian.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 5. The same year, he joined the Roman Catholic Church as a Dominican Tertiary, and afterwards was active in the Cambridge University Catholic Association.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 9. In the following decade he published translations of √âtienne Gilson, Karl Adam, and Achille Ratti (by then Pope Pius XI), and gave three papers on Dante at Catholic summer schools in Cambridge and Salzburg.Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 7. A colleague believed that his work in Italian studies \\"all went into his lectures and teaching\\", rather than research for publication.Quoted anonymously in Oakeshott, \\"Edward Bullough,\\" 8-9. He was appointed University Lecturer in Italian in 1926.Trayes, Biographical History of Caius, 132. No reference has been located in the Cambridge University Reporter. Bullough was elected to the Chair of Italian at Cambridge in March 1933.Will Spens, \\"Professorship of Italian: Election,\\" Cambridge University Reporter 63, no. 29 (1933): 830. In his printed inaugural lecture, titled Italian Perspectives, he claims that the Italian \\"perspective\\" is one of \\"continuity of classical with medieval and modern times\\",Bullough, Italian Perspectives, 36. so that tradition is treated \\"with the easy familiarity of a family possession\\".Bullough, Italian Perspectives, 32. He argues that because the European classical tradition is also, for the Italian, the native tradition, \\"the 'national' inheritance of Italy lies at the same time embedded in the foundations of Europe\\".Bullough, Italian Perspectives, 56. In illustration, Bullough proposes Roman law, the Renaissance, and the Romantic movement as \\"three contributions made by Italy to the patrimony of the civilised world\\".Bullough, Italian Perspectives, 56. He offers the contemporary fascist movement as a tentative fourth:Bullough, Italian Perspectives, 62-63. a successor to the chair, Uberto Limentani, believed there was \\"no doubt\\" that Bullough sympathised with fascism.Uberto Limentani, \\"Leone and Arthur Serena and the Cambridge Chair of Italian, 1919-1934,\\" Modern Language Review 92, no. 4 (1997): 891.

It was classified as a party based on the fact that it developed a platform, a central body, and an official publication. These were nine disciples of Portakalian who took the initiative in autumn 1885 to create the Armenakan party. These nine young people were Meguerditch Avetisian, M. Baroudjian, Panos Terlemezian, Grigor Adjemian, Grigor Adian, Grigor Beozikian, Rouben Chatavarian, Kevork Handjian and Garegin Manoukian. The founder of the Armenakan party, Mekertich Portukalian (from Marseilles) kept in touch with the leaders, and published a journal of political and social enlightenment, \\"Armenia\\" (1885-1923). Portukalian is also cited as the father of the Armenian Patriotic Society of Europe. After Mekertich Portukalian, the Armenians of Van continued developing the political principles of Armenian nationalism in secret. The party's aim soon became winning the right of Armenians to rule over themselves through revolutionary armed struggle and thus liberate Armenia from the Ottoman Empire. Its concept of revolution was distinctly low-keyed in comparison with that of succeeding organisations; it viewed terrorism, agitation and militant demonstrations with disfavor, preferring instead to deploy Armenians trained in the use of arms as guerrillas against the Ottoman Empire. The party's main misconception was that enemies of the Ottoman Empire would intervene and rescue the Armenian people throughout the period 1885‚Äì1918. With the turn of the century, Armenakans had cells outside Van, in other towns in the province, as well as in Trabzon and Istanbul. The military structure was developed in Russian Transcaucasia, in Persia and in the United States.

Quotes * In spite of all the innovations, verse is still verse as differentiated from prose pieces. * Music is the basic attribute of the language of poetry that differentiates it from other forms. * The idea of perfection itself suggests that the condition is not achievable, at best not in the physical sense. * I don't know really, why I write poetry. I suppose I write poems because I have to; because I have nothing better to write. Poetic style Saif's poetic fervour emerged when he was a student of grade- VIII. In 1962, his first poems published appeared in the literary periodical Shomokal edited by Sikander Abu Zafar.

The conflict may have begun as early as 787/88, though specific outbreaks of the war are largely dated to 793 and 796. Some violence by Bedouin raiders in the Judean Desert also erupted in 797, though it is not clear if this was directly related to the Qaysi-Yamani conflict. Background In the 8th century, Palestine and Transjordan were functioning as two administrative districts: Jund Filastin and Jund al-Urdunn. Jund Filastin stretched from Rafah to Lajjun, encompassing much of the coastal plain of Palestine and included Samaria and Mount Hebron, while Jund al-Urdunn consisted of the Galilee, Jabal Amil, and most of Transjordan (east of the Jordan River). Both districts were a part of the larger province of Bilad ash- Sham of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids annexed Bilad ash-Sham after defeating the Umayyad dynasty in 750. The capital of the Caliphate was subsequently moved from Damascus to Baghdad, and Palestine consequently lost its central position in the state, becoming a distant district whose affairs were not as closely monitored or regulated as they were under the Umayyads. The Abbasids were also facing difficulties suppressing rebellions throughout the Caliphate at the time of the intertribal hostilities in Palestine. Various Arab tribes populated the regions of Palestine and Transjordan and formed confederations. The Mudhar (also referred to as Qays or Nizar) faction, led by Amir ibn Umara al-Murri, represented the northern tribes, while the Yamani faction represented the southern tribes.Gil 1997, p. 283. Ibrahim ibn Salih, the governor of Bilad ash-Sham and a cousin of the caliph al-Mahdi, regularly dealt with the affairs in Jund Filastin. He and his aide, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim tended to favor the Yamani tribe in its disputes with the Mudhar. According to an account by a Christian source from the time, the towns of Gaza, Bayt Jibrin, Ascalon in Jund Filastin and Sariphaea in Jund al-Urdunn were destroyed in 788, or during the reign of Patriarch Elias II (r. 770‚Äì797), during the hostilities between the Abbasids and a force of rebels commanded by Yahya ibn Irmiya, a Jew from Transjordan. War =First outbreak= According to 9th-century historian al-Tabari, clashes between the Arab tribes of Palestine had begun in 790/91, while 15th-century Ibn Taghribirdi wrote that the conflict began as early as 787/88. The 12th-century Syriac Orthodox patriarch, Michael the Syrian and 13th-century historian Ibn al-Athir asserted that the conflict started in 792/93.Linder 2007, pp. 22‚Äì23. According to the latter, hostilities commenced following an incident where a member of the northern Banu al-Qayn tribe came to grind his wheat at a location in the al- Balqa region of Transjordan and stole marrows and watermelons from a southern tribesman (either from the Banu Judham or Banu Lakhm tribes).Gil 1997, p. 284. Casualties became considerable as tribes from the Golan Heights and Jund al- Urdunn joined the war as allies of the Yamani coalition. The strife was brought to an end and violence calmed down by 29 December 793, after decisive intervention by the new caliph Harun al-Rashid and his brothers. =Second outbreak= In 796, battles between the Mudhar and Yamani tribes broke out again for unspecified reasons. It is presumed by historian Moshe Gil that the northern Mudhar tribes instigated the hostilities and that the focus of their attacks was directed not only against the Yamani federation, but the Abbasid state itself. Harun al-Rashid viewed this as a rebellion and dispatched a large army headed by Ja'far ibn Yahya al-Barmaki to quell the revolt. Battles between the two sides erupted throughout Palestine, and during a major confrontation near Jerusalem, Ibn al-Athir wrote that 800 Yamani tribesmen were killed, while 600 (or 300) Mudhari tribesmen were killed. According to a 10th-century Christian source, one side suffered 80 dead and the other side, 60. According to Gil, al-Barmaki \\"put down the rebels with an iron hand and much blood was spilled.\\" Al-Barmaki assigned Issa ibn al-Akki as his representative for the whole province of Bilad ash-Sham, while he appointed Salih bin Sulayman as his representative in al-Balqa. Thus, Jund al-Urdunn, which had normally been under the authority of the governor of Damascus, gained separate administration. This was a result of al-Barmaki's belief that Transjordan was the epicenter of the rebellion. Aftermath The Abbasid governor of Jund Filastin, Harthama ibn A'yan, was reassigned to Egypt in 796. During and after the war, anarchy became widespread in Palestine. In addition, the main roads of the district were rendered impassable due to the presence of hostile Bedouin bands.Palestine Exploration Fund 1872, p. 167. Various Arab tribes that previously attempted to raid the Christian monasteries of the Judean Desert, but were prevented from doing so by the state authorities, took advantage of the security vacuum and attacked several of them. The St. Chariton Monastery was robbed and on 20 March 796 or 19 March 797,Linder 2007, p. 23. 20‚Äì28 monks at Mar Saba were reportedly suffocated to death or cremated, while around 100 monks were assaulted. The monasteries of St. Cyriacus, St. Theodosius and St. Euthymius were also raided at some point during or after the hostilities.

Life He was the son of William Bradford of London and was born in St. Anne's, Blackfriars. He was educated at St Paul's School; and when the school was closed, owing to the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London, he attended Charterhouse School. He was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1669, but left without a degree in consequence of religious scruples. He devoted himself for a time to the study of medicine; but he was admitted in 1680, through the favour of Archbishop William Sancroft, to the degree of M.A. by royal mandate. He only took holy orders after the Glorious Revolution of 1689, and in the meantime acted as private tutor in the families of several country gentlemen. Bradford was ordained deacon and priest in 1690, and in the spring of the following year was elected by the governors of St. Thomas's Hospital the minister of their church in Southwark. He soon received the lectureship of St. Mary-le- Bow, and was tutor to the two grandsons of Archbishop John Tillotson, with whom he resided at Carlisle House, Lambeth. In November 1693 Tillotson collated Bradford to the rectory of St. Mary-le-Bow; he then resigned his minor ecclesiastical preferments, but soon after accepted the lectureship of All Hallows, Bread Street. Bradford was a frequent preacher before the corporation of London, and was a staunch whig. On 30 January 1698 he preached before William III, who that March following appointed Bradford one of the royal chaplains in ordinary. The appointment was continued by Queen Anne, by whose command he was created D.D. on the occasion of her visit to the University of Cambridge, 16 April 1705. In 1699 Bradford delivered the Boyle lecture in St. Paul's Cathedral. He was elected master of Corpus Christi College on 17 May 1716; and on 21 April 1718 was nominated to the bishopric of Carlisle, to which he was consecrated on 1 June. In 1723 he was translated to the see of Rochester, and was also appointed dean of Westminster, which he held in commendam with the bishopric of Rochester. In 1724 Bradford resigned the mastership of Corpus Christi, and in 1725 became the first dean of the revived Order of the Bath. He died at the deanery of Westminster, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Works Bradford published more than 20 separate sermons. One of these, Discourse concerning Baptismal and Spiritual Regeneration, 2nd ed., London, 1709, attained popularity. A ninth edition was published in 1819 by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. As Boyle lecturer he preached eight sermons on The Credibility of the Christian Revelation, from its Intrinsick Evidence. These, with a ninth sermon preached in his own church in January 1700, were issued with other Boyle lectures delivered between 1691 and 1732, in A Defence of Natural and Revealed Religion, &c.; 3 vols., London, 1739. Family Bradford's wife, who survived him, was a daughter of Captain Ellis of Medbourne in Leicestershire, and bore him one son and two daughters. One of the latter was married to Reuben Clarke, archdeacon of Essex, and the other to John Denne, archdeacon of Rochester. His son, the Revd William Bradford, died on 15 July 1728, aged thirty-two, when he was archdeacon of Rochester and vicar of Newcastle upon Tyne.

It is a form of ground billiards, using one or more balls, a stick with a mallet-like head, and usually featuring one or more targets such as hoops or holes. ' was ancestral to the games golf, palle-malle and croquet, and (by moving it indoors and playing on a table with smaller equipment), billiards. History The first known written record of ' is a Renaissance Latin text dating to 1416. The in the name probably means 'maul, mallet', from Latin . An alternative meaning of 'straw' has been suggested (Modern French ), on the basis that the target hoops used in some versions of the game were sometimes made of bound straw. Quite popular in various forms in France and Italy in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, the game developed into pall-mall in the early modern period, which spread to Scotland then England; this, in turn, eventually led to croquet. According to Brant√¥me, King Henry II of France (ruled 1547-1559) was an excellent player of and (a form of that eventually developed into tennis and other racquet sports).

Game play The game makes use of one or more balls that are generally of boxwood, but higher-quality balls are of medlar. The ball is struck with a long stick with a mallet- or foot-like end, similar to a croquet mallet or golf club, respectively; it is essentially a heavy version of the billiard (which eventually developed into the cue stick). Different variants of the game may have differing goals or targets (if any), ranging from croquet-like hoops to golf-like holes in the ground.

During the 1890s, local residents and surfers saw the need to educate and train people in lifesaving techniques due to frequent mishaps taking place in the dangerous rips and currents of Bronte and the nearby Tamarama beaches. The club was founded in 1903 and the movement has since spread to other parts of New South Wales and the rest of the country. The club's claim to be the world's first of its kind was reinforced when a time capsule buried in February 1931 was uncovered and it contained a document signed by club officers agreeing that Bronte was and the first.About Us See also *Surf lifesaving *Surf Life Saving Australia *List of Australian surf lifesaving clubs References External links * Category:Surf Life Saving Australia clubs Category:Sporting clubs in Sydney Category:1903 establishments in Australia Category:Sports clubs established in 1903 Category:Bronte, New South Wales ","title":"Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club"},{"id":"23202253","text":"Jan W≈Çadys≈Çaw Dawid (born 26 June 1859 in Lublin ‚Äì died 9 July 1914) was a teacher, psychologist, pioneer of educational psychology and experimental pedagogy in Poland. He was a lecturer at the Flying University (now known as the Society for Educational Courses, also known as The Society for Science Courses) in Warsaw. He since held other numerous roles including editor of a number of Polish journals such as the Educational Review (PrzeglƒÖd Pedagogiczny) (1889‚Äì1897), Voice (G≈Ços) (1900‚Äì1905) and Social Review (PrzeglƒÖd Spo≈Çeczny) (1906‚Äì1907).Bibliografia filozofii polskiej 1896-1918, Andrzej Przymusia≈Ça, Maria M≈Çoczkowska (Bibliography of Polish Philosophy, 1896-1918); Life Dawid studied law at Warsaw University from 1872 and after completing the degree, went on to Leipzig and Halle, Saxony-Anhalt from 1882 to 1884 to study natural sciences. There he was heavily influenced by W. Wundt and H. Ebbinghaus. His largest merits were on the basis of empirical psychology to spread the idea of conducting experimental research on children, on their perceptions and concepts of the world, their thinking and intelligence, while the idea of developing a child's mind, his will and action skills. These ideas disseminated by both the conduct of systematic research, involvement in the numerous group of collaborators, by writing books on these studies, developing their own research and by translating books from many languages. David's interest in issues related initially to education, which had developed a base in the work of science (1892). His many influences in education while in Germany included figures such as Wilhelm Dilthey, A. Lichtwark, W.T. Preyer and W. Rein. Upon returning to Warsaw, Dawid made his first publication in 1887: Programme of Psycho-Educational Observations of Children from Birth to the Age of 20. This was also the period he began translating German, Russian, French and English texts into Polish and began one of his major work Object Lessons (published 1891). In 1889 he married Jadwiga Szczawi≈Ñska, teacher and founder of the Flying University. Unfortunately, due to vast political activity in Poland at the time and difficulties in financing (Dawid's post as editor of G≈Ços ending in 1905) eventually accumulated to the taking of Jadwiga's life in 1910 and subsequent worsening of Dawid's health. Dawid later fled to Krak√≥w where he enjoyed autonomy from the Tsarist police. In his O duszy nauczycielstwa (The Souls of Teachers) (1912) Dawid determines the ideal characteristics of a teacher, his \\"soul.\\" As the most important among them David feels the love of human souls, and next to it mentions the need for excellence, a sense of responsibility and obligation, the accuracy of internal and moral courage. In his greatest work of psychological intelligence, the will and ability to work (1911) shows the relationship between intelligence, will and ability to work, which could be described as the glorification of work. Dawid believed that the able, and want to be able to - to three sources, which supply human life. \\"Know how\\" that is, to have intelligence, \\"want to\\" - will, \\"power\\" - the ability to work. David returned to Warsaw in 1913, continuing his teaching activities and planning many experiments before dying in 1914.

The confrontation occurred between the two factions of Carrera and Bernardo O'Higgins, resulting in a defeat for O'Higgins that would in turn lead on to the defeat of the nationalists by the royalist forces at the battle of Rancagua a month later. Background On 23 July, after two months of arguing with the Supreme Director Francisco de la Lastra, and unable to retreat to Argentina, Jos√© Miguel Carrera seized power in Chile once again, dismissing the Director and installing a new junta. Carrera had refused to accept the Treaty of Lircay, signed by Francisco's government. The treaty would have overturned many acts of the governments in the last few years, including removing the Chilean flag created during the administration of Carrera, and introducing acts of devotion to King Fernando VII and a promise of absolutist restoration. On a more personal level, the negotiations over the treaty had not included provision for the exchange of prisoners; Carrera was a prisoner of the royalists in Chill√°n at the time of the signature of the treaty, before then escaping from royal custody to join other patriots in exile in Mendoza, Argentina. O'Higgins, meanwhile, was still the commander in chief of Francisco's government, and had acquiesced to the signature of the treaty. O'Higgins marched from Talca towards Santiago with a division of troops to remove Carrera. O'Higgins regarded Carrera and his political faction as being responsible for the military failures of the earlier campaign, as well as the previous overthrow of O'Higgins' political mentor, Juan Mart√≠nez de Rozas. In the eve of the battle O'Higgins encamped in the Mardones property, to the south of Maipo River, waiting for Carrera's forces, overnighting at the small hamlet of P√©rez farm. The battle Luis Carrera, younger brother and commander of Jos√© Miguel Carrera's army at Las Tres Acequias On the morning of 26 August, the then brigadier O'Higgins crossed the Maipo River and on to the level ground on the other side. His intention was to advance rapidly on Santiago and thereby to defeat Carrera; because of this, he did not initially realise the size and disposition of Carrera's forces. At 13:00 hours, O' Higgins' advance parties, under the command of Ramon Freire, joined combat with the forward echelons of Carrera's forces, under the command of Jos√©'s youngest brother, Colonel Luis Carrera, protected by a low bank. Luis Carrera had deployed his forces with the infantry to his right, the artillery to the centre, his cavalry to his left and behind these, a line of eight hundred cavalry militia from Aconcagua under the command of the colonel Jos√© Maria Portus. These militia were badly equipped, of poor quality, and were only deployed during the final phases of the battle. Eschewing further reconnaissance, O'Higgins ordered his men forward in a determined attack against the larger enemy force, apparently optimistic following the early preliminary victory delivered by Freire along the bank. After an unfruitful cannonade, O' Higgins attacked in force at 16:00, placing his infantry in the centre of his line, supported by four guns, and dividing his cavalry between both flanks. After one hour of fruitless attack, and having received numerous losses without causing much damage to the defenders, O'Higgins' forces began to retreat in relative disorder. This moment was seized by the cavalry of Luis Carrera, who ordered Diego Jose Benavente to encircle the enemy's right flank and begin to further disrupt his line. This was followed by the mounted militia of Aconcagua charging the middle of O'Higgins' line, breaking through it and taking numerous prisoners, amongst them four senior officers. O'Higgins' men fled, mainly to the south, attempting to cross the Maipo river and seeking safety in the buildings around Chena. O'Higgins' own mount had collapsed wounded, and he retreated from the field on a borrowed horse, leading a unit of 100 men to safety. Meanwhile, the bulk of the 3rd division of Carrera's force, under the command of Jos√© Miguel Carrera himself, had been positioned on the suburbs of Santiago at the beginning the battle. Despite a force march, it did not arrive in time to take part in the main action. When the cavalry from the 3rd division arrived, it joined the units chasing O'Higgins' men from the battlefield - but as the sun set around 18:30, Carrera's men gave up the pursuit. Consequences of the battle Luis Carrera did not pursue his enemies any further that night, keeping to his position. He placed some forces as a diversion towards the Hacienda de Tango, accompanied by the guns he had seized from O'Higgins. Whilst these guns provided a desultory bombardment, Carrera's main body left Perez's farm and retreated two kilometers to the north, to the hamlet of Ochagavia. On the next day, O'Higgins finally regrouped to the south of the Maipo and reunited his men, with the intention of joining them with his rear units and undertaking a fresh attack. In the midst of this, news came from Talcahuano of the arrival of the royalist expedition of General Mariano Osorio, advancing quickly towards them. This intervention encouraged both sides to settle their differences and to jointly defend their country. O'Higgins sent a representative to Jos√© Miguel Carrera to convey the news of the situation and his intentions. After some further negotiations, the two leaders settled their differences at the Hacienda de Tango, jointly signing a declaration in Santiago on 4 September. On the following day O'Higgins left the capital to assume the leadership of the 1st division, consisting of his old forces, under the overall command of Jos√© Miguel Carrera. These forces would conduct the defence of Chile, leading up to the disaster of the battle of Rancagua.

In the , Deebing Heights had a population of 2,039 people. Geography Deebing Heights is a large suburb encompassing the area from the eponymous hills surrounding Deebing Creek in the north of the suburb through to the lower foothills of the Flinders Peak Group in the south. From the Grampian Hills it is possible, on a clear day, to see the Brisbane skyline and the Pacific Ocean. History Cricket match at Deebing Heights in 1910 The suburb takes its name from the Deebing Creek, which in turn is an Aboriginal word dibing meaning mosquito or other small winged insect. The Deebing Creek Mission Aboriginal Reserve was founded by the Aboriginal Protection Society of Ipswich on 130 acres at the southern end of Grampian Drive in 1887. On 2 January 1892, construction was completed and the reserve was officially proclaimed. Missionary Edward Fuller was the first manager of Deebing Creek which initially catered for Aboriginal people from the Ipswich area. By the turn of the century the mission superintendent reported that the inmates of Deebing Creek came from many different tribes with some children being sent to the mission from as far away as Burketown. Government records show that the mission was supplied with provisions by the Department from February 1891 to February 1894. In March 1894 to June 1896 a grant of ¬£250 per annum was authorised. In November 1896 the Rev. Peter Robertson, chairman of the Aboriginal Protection Association, requested and was granted additional funding for building and the purchase of more land and the annual grant to the mission was increased to ¬£450. At the same time a gazettal notice made provision under the Industrial and Reformatory Schools Act of 1865 for the establishment of an industrial school which came to be known as the Deebing Creek Industrial School. The industrial school at Myora was closed and some of the children were transferred to Deebing Creek Industrial School. In November 1914 a grant of ¬£200 was made to assist in the transfer of the mission from Deebing Creek to reserve land at Purga. The reasons for the move were the abundance of good agricultural land and the greater distance from the town centre. The mission committee was still acquiring property and land for the mission, with the Chief Protector noting in a Departmental letter that 62 acres of farm land adjoining the Purga site had been purchased for ¬£600 by the committee. In 1915 the mission was relocated to Purga. From the closing of the reserve, the suburb remained largely undeveloped until the 1990s when Winland Developments commenced construction on a new premium acreage estate named 'Paradise Heights' in the southern Grampian Hills on the lower foothills of the Flinders Peak Group. In the next decade, work began on a smaller allotment development in the north between the Cunningham Highway and Deebing Creek. At the beginning of the 2000s, Deebing Heights was identified as being an important growth corridor within the planned Ripley Valley, a masterplanned city that will one day be the size of Cairns. In 2007, the Urban Land Development Authority Act 2007 (Qld) was passed taking planning powers for most of Deebing Heights away from local government and giving it to the State Government. The Urban Land Development Authority is now responsible for all development in the Ripley Valley. The area that is now Deebing Heights has been an important settlement since Queensland's early colonial history, but was only gazetted as a locality in 2000 and then a suburb in 2004, previously being part of Purga. It is home to the heritage listed Deebing Creek Mission, an Aboriginal reserve located at the southern end of Grampian Drive, which acted as a home to the Ugarapul/Yuggera tribe until its closing in 1915. On 8 September 2002, Deebing Heights was named and bounded as a locality. On 2 July 2004, it was redesignated a suburb. In 2003, the Western Transport Corridor was planned to be built from Springfield to Yamanto via White Rock, Ripley and Deebing Heights. In 2009, construction was completed and Deebing Heights residents are now only minutes from Springfield and travel time to Brisbane and Gold Coast is also considerably shorter. Deebing Heights State School opened on 1 January 2016. In the , Deebing Heights had a population of 2,039 people. Development was slow to begin in Deebing Heights with Paradise Heights, a premium acreage estate only beginning development in the mid-1990s. However, with development planned over the entire suburb, it has a projected population of 25,000 people by 2020. Heritage sites Deebing Heights has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * South Deebing Creek Road: former Deebing Creek Mission Housing The acreage lots in the southern Grampian Hills give space for quite large and generous houses.

Most are presumed dead, but the South Korean government estimates some 560 South Korean prisoners of war still survive in North Korea.2007 Ministry of Defense Report to the National Assembly (2007ÎÖÑ Íµ≠Î∞©Î∂Ä Íµ≠Ï†ï Í∞êÏÇ¨ ÏûêÎ£å). Ministry of Defense, Republic of Korea. 2007. The issue of unaccounted South Korean POWs from the Korean War has been in dispute since the Armistice in 1953. North Korea continues to deny it holds these South Korean POWs. Interest in this issue has been renewed since 1994, when Lt. Cho Chang-ho, a former South Korean soldier presumed to have been killed in the war, escaped from North Korea. As of 2008, 79 former South Korean soldiers have escaped from North Korea. There have also been reports that several hundred US prisoners of war may not have been returned by North Korea,The U.S. knew in 1953 North Koreans Held American P.O.W.'s. New York Times, September 17, 1996 article.Nigel Cawthorne's book The Iron Cage is a sequel to his controversial book The Bamboo Cage, about Vietnam War POWs. The Iron Cage concerns unreturned POWs from earlier wars, particularly Korea and World War II. but the vast majority of unaccounted POWs are South Koreans. Origins The treatment of prisoners of war and their repatriation was a complicated issue in the Korean War. Nominally, both the Communists and United Nations forces were committed to the terms of the 1949 Third Geneva Convention, regarding the treatment of POWs. However, both sides applied exceptions and the negotiations regarding POWs were contentious and difficult. Korean prisoners were assigned to one of three types of POW camps. Peace camps were for POWs sympathetic to communism, reform camps held highly skilled POWs who were indoctrinated in communist ideologies, and the third type was the normal POW camps. Prisoners in the first two camp types were prized and not usually exchanged nor released. The North Koreans viewed South Korean forces not as enemy soldiers protected by the Geneva Conventions, but as fellow Koreans who had been led astray into \\"war crimes against their people\\" by imperialist forces. According to such reasoning, it was justified to \\"re- educate\\" these South Koreans and allow the ones who were fit to volunteer for the North Korean military. This was common practice and many South Korean POWs had been enlisted in the North Korean military. Although North Korea asserts that all such former South Korean soldiers had volunteered freely, others (including former South Korean POWs who have escaped in recent years) allege there was coercion. The UN forces found that many of the prisoners it captured were former South Korean citizens who had been enlisted into the Korean People's Army (in many cases, allegedly against their will). Many of the Chinese soldiers who were captured were former Nationalists who had been enlisted into the Chinese People's Liberation Army after the defeat of the Nationalist armies in China in 1949. Large numbers of such prisoners did not want to be returned to North Korea or Communist China. Because of such prisoners, the UN Command was reluctant to abide by a literal interpretation of Article 118 of the Geneva Convention which states that all POWs were to be \\"released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities.\\" The UN wanted a voluntary repatriation where POWs could choose which side to return to. The Communists insisted on a full all-for-all exchange according to a literal interpretation of Article 118. When negotiations for POW exchanges began in 1951, the UN Command estimated that 88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing in action (MIA). However the communist side claimed they held only 7,712 South Korean POWs. The UN Command protested the huge discrepancy in their POW estimates and the number given by the communists, and noted that the number of POWs submitted by the Communists was far smaller than the 65,000 South Koreans that North Korean and Chinese had claimed they had captured in their own announcements. The Communists insisted that many POWs had been killed in UN air raids and died of disease and all captives who had recognized their crimes of \\"participating in imperialists' war\\" had been released at the front and allowed to return to their original army or home town. The UN Command noted that only about 200 former POWs had returned to UN lines and charged that the Communist list was small because many South Korean POWs had been press-ganged into joining the North Korean military. The UN demanded that South Korean POWs in the North Korean military also be repatriated. The Communists claimed that all those former POWs who were serving in their forces had volunteered to do so and refuted this as \\"a conspiracy to carry away more than one hundred thousand soldiers from the People's Army.\\" South Korea's President Syngman Rhee had been reluctant about the Armistice talks to begin with and was particularly opposed to any involuntary repatriation of former South Koreans to North Korea. Many other South Korean leaders had also been unhappy with the ceasefire negotiations in general as well as the issue of anti-communist POWs in UN custody. The tensions between the South Koreans and their UN allies erupted when the South Koreans unilaterally released 25,000 anti-Communist POWs on June 18 of 1953. The unilateral release of the anti-Communist POWs by South Koreans complicated negotiations. Doing so without resolving the issue of South Korean MIA missing from the POW lists from the Communist forces may have been detrimental to the POWs that were held in North Korea. However, the fact that the communists began with such a small list of POWs indicated that they had little intention of returning many of the South Koreans. The UN and the Communists finally signed the Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, a little over a month after the release of the anti-communist POWs by South Korea. This ended the fierce fighting which had continued for two years even as negotiations dragged on. Both the UN and Communist forces agreed that POWs who did not desire repatriation would be turned over to a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission led by the Indian military that would interview individual prisoners and allow them to choose their side in a neutral setting. In the following two months, POWs exchanges were carried out under the agreement. The UN Command repatriated 75,823 communist POWs (among them, 70,183 North Koreans) while the Communists only returned 12,773 UN POWs. Only 8,726 South Koreans were returned. That was less than 10% of the total of South Korean MIAs. Number of POWs held in North Korea =South Korean POWs= The exact number of South Korean POWs who were detained in North Korea after the war is unknown, as is the number who still survive in North Korea. In its report to the legislature in October 2007, the Korean Ministry of Defense reported that \\"a total of 41,971 South Korean soldiers were missing during the Korean War. 8,726 were repatriated through POW exchanges after the Armistice of 1953. Some 13,836 have been determined to have been killed based on other information. To date, the status of 19,409 soldiers has not been confirmed.\\" Most of these unconfirmed were believed to have been unrepatriated POWs. Other estimates of South Korean POWs held by the North Koreans at the Armistice have been higher. Yi Hang-gu, a writer and North Korea expert currently in South Korea who had served as a Sergeant in the Korean People's Army, has testified that he commanded former South Korean POWs who had been enlisted into the Korean People's Army during the Korean War. Yi's unit, the 22nd Brigade, was composed mostly of former South Korean captives led by North Korean officers and non-commissioned officers. Yi has said the number of South Korean POWs who survived in North Korea at the end of the fighting \\"could have been about 50,000-60,000.\\"In July 2020 it is reported that 50,000 South Korean POWS were never repatriated from North Korea in 1953.BBC News July 26,2020 The children of Korean War prisoners who never came home The South Korean government estimates that 560 South Korean POWs still survive in North Korea. This number is based upon analysis of various testimonies from defectors and former POWs who managed to escape North Korea. Other researchers (e.g. the Korean Institute for National Unification's 2008 White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea) think the actual number of POWs still alive in North Korea could be higher, since many of the POWs who have recently managed to escape had been presumed to have been killed. =American and other UN POWs= On September 17, 1996, the New York Times reported the possible presence of American POWs in North Korea, citing recently declassified documents. The documents showed that the U.S. Defense Department knew in December 1953 that \\"more than 900 American troops were alive at the end of the war but were never released by the North Koreans\\". The Pentagon did not confirm the report, saying they had no clear evidence that any Americans were being held against their will in North Korea but pledged to continue to investigate accounts of defectors and others who said they had seen American prisoners there. The North Korean government has said it is not holding any Americans. Treatment of POWs by North Korean and Chinese forces North Korea did not recognize the POW status of its South Korean captives, and viewed them as \\"liberated fighters.\\" Because of this fundamental difference in perspective, captured South Korean soldiers were treated very differently from other UN captives. Articles 49 through 57 of the 1949 Geneva Convention III specifically restrict the use of POW labor for military purposes. However, it was common practice to enlist former South Korean volunteers into its own forces after several weeks of re-education. Some of the South Koreans were assigned to front line combat units, such as Yi Hang-gu's 22nd Brigade. Many more were assigned to construction units repairing railroads and airfields and disposing unexploded ordnance. This repair work was particularly dangerous due to the heavy air raids on supply lines and airfields in North Korea by UN air forces. The Chinese forces initially did not recognize the Geneva Conventions and followed its own \\"Policy of Tolerance\\". This policy was based upon Confucian codes and traditions where enemy forces who have surrendered are allowed to join their captors. Official Chinese records distinguish between prisoners who were \\"captured\\" and those who \\"surrendered\\". On July 13 of 1952, the Chinese forces changed their policy and committed to the Geneva Conventions - and demanded full repatriation of its own POWs according to Article 118. Punishment for transgressions by the South Koreans was harsh. Lieutenant Cho Chang-ho, a former South Korean artillery officer who escaped from North Korea in 1994, testified before the U.S. Congress on April 27, 2006. In 1952 he had been caught trying to escape back to South Korean lines and was sentenced by court martial to thirteen years in prison. He served six years in a political prison camp where conditions were unsanitary and prisoners suffered from malnutrition. There were four other South Korean officer POWs held with Cho, all of whom perished from disease in prison. Other UN prisoners also suffered horrific treatment. Out of 7,000 US prisoners, 2,800 (40 percent) died in captivity. Diet and medical conditions were notoriously bad. However, other UN prisoners were not enlisted in large numbers into the North Korean forces or made to work for the communist war effort, the way that South Koreans had been. The diet, as bad as it was, was comparable to that of North Korean peasants and medical supplies were unavailable to doctors. From 1951, the Chinese tried to improve the treatment of POWs after being alarmed by the excessive death rate. The Chinese recognized the propaganda value of POWs and established permanent POW camps in the far North, close to the Yalu River. The Chinese forces also held indoctrination sessions. These sessions gained notoriety for potential brainwashing, though \\"no confirmed cases of brainwashing came out of the Korean War.\\" One of the oddest events held by the North Koreans and Chinese during this war was the 1952 POW olympics. UN and South Korean POWs gathered together in November 1952 at the Pyuoktong Camp and competed in many athletic matches, including softball and sack races. Although the event was blatantly propagandistic, many of the POWs cooperated since it was their only opportunity to see if comrades in other camps had survived. South Korean and other UN POWs were also treated differently with regards to the POW exchange. The majority of surviving UN POWs were repatriated or turned over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with Section 3 of the Armistice Agreement. South Koreans who had been enlisted into the North Korean construction units were never reported as POWs during the negotiations to begin with. Some of the former South Korean POWs who have escaped reported that they did not even know there was an exchange of POWs. Life of POWs in North Korea after the Armistice After the Korean War, the former South Korean POWs were given North Korean citizenship after formally being discharged from their camps and units. Most of them were assigned to work at coal mines near their camps. Although they were nominally full citizens, they faced much discrimination in their employment and residence. Within North Korea's rigid caste system, they were amongst the lowest castes and were under surveillance by the State Security (secret police) agency. Even though most POWs are now over 70 years old, their movement and residence is still restricted to remote regions and the surveillance by State Security still continues. The discrimination extended to the children of POWs who were restricted in their careers, barred from membership in the Workers' Party of Korea, college admissions and military service. Mr. Koh Eul Won, a former POW who escaped to South Korea in 2001, testified that \\"in North Korea, one must complete military service to be treated like a human being. However, our children were rejected by the military solely for the reason of being the children of POWs. Therefore, our children had no choice but to work in the coal mines as we had done.\\" Young-Bok Yoo, who escaped in 2000, also writes about the discrimination and surveillance in his Memoirs. South Korean repatriation efforts The Seoul government regards the POW issues as a \\"basic national responsibility\\" related to the protection of its citizens. Since the end of the Korean War, Korean government has repeatedly raised this POWs issue to North Korea at various meetings. Between 1953 and 1964 Seoul called for the repatriation of POWs 11 times .This article can also be searched for at the Korea Integrated Newspaper Database (using the date and title But North Korea flatly denied any South Korean POWs were being held against their will. A few months after the first inter-Korean Summit of Jun 15, 2000, the South repatriated all 63 former North Korean agents and guerrillas in its custody who had completed their prison terms in the South and wanted to return to the North. Many in the South criticized the Seoul government for failing to secure the return of South Korean prisoners of war or any civilian abductees in return. The repatriations were a good will gesture and no conditions officially were attached. The South Korea government did expect its gesture to lead to more cooperation and eventual reconciliation between the two sides. Contrary to the Seoul government's expectation, North Korea only enraged liberals and conservatives alike in the South Korean legislature when it demanded billions of dollars in compensation for alleged atrocities against the repatriated agents. North Korea has consistently refused to discuss the POW issue. During the second inter-Korea summit of October 2007, President Roh Moo-hyun received no response from his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong- il.\\"Seoul Considering task force on POWs\\" Korea Herald, February 23, 2008 Human rights groups in Korea and other countries have been unhappy with the two previous Presidents, Kim Dae Jung and Roh Moo Hyun with regards to the POW issue. Both the Kim and Roh governments were criticized for being excessively cautious about provoking the North Koreans and \\"lacking determination\\" in getting back the POWs. Previously, before the 1990s, South Korea was not a democracy and this issue was not raised by grassroots groups before the government. The Lee Myung Bak government clarified that the POW and abductee issues was of high priority and raised the issue as one of main agendas for inter-Korean dialogues. It has expressed its commitment to persuade the North to take active and sincere measures, although nothing has changed since the 2008 announcement. It has also created an agency within South Korea's Unification Ministry whose task is to deal with North Korean human rights and POW related issues. Appeals for repatriation by NGOs Non-governmental Organizations(NGOs) from around the world have appealed for the repatriation of South Korean POWs. * The Korea National Red Cross: In 1999. The Korea National Red Cross appealed to international organization to give their attention to the repatriation of hundreds of South Koreans held captive in North Korea. At the time, the Red Cross released a list of 454 South Koreans who had been kidnapped by the North since the end of the war and 231 POWs. * The National Assembly of South Korea: On 8 December 2000, South Korean Parliament passed the resolution of urging for North Korea to repatriate all detained POWs. * World Veterans Federation : On November 1997, WVF 22nd General Assembly issued a statement calling for the North Korea to repatriate detained South Korean POWs and abductees. * Family Union of Korean POWs Detained in North Korea (Íµ≠Íµ∞Ìè¨Î°úÍ∞ÄÏ°±Ìöå): Founded by detained POWs' families in the South on Feb. 19, 2005. On June 23, 2005, it hosted a press conference to urge the North Korea's immediate repatriation of detained POWs, at the front of the hotel where inter-Korea ministerial talk was being held. * The International Korean War Foundation Korean War POW Affairs Committee: Advocates on behalf of South Korean POWs from its offices in Los Angeles, CA. The Committee had arranged for Lt. Cho Chang Ho (the first former South Korean POW to escape North Korea) to give testimony at the US Congress in 2006. * MULMANGCHO: Non- profit Organization for South Korean POW * Korean War POW Affairs in USA POWs who have escaped from North Korea On October 1994, Lt. Cho Chang-ho successfully escaped to South Korea. He was the first South Korean POW to have made it out of North Korea since the Korean War ended. Thereafter, during the past decade, as of June 2009, 79 prisoners of war (and about 180 of their family members) have escaped from the North. In July 2010, a POW was reported to have escaped from North Korea, but was arrested in China and forcibly repatriated. The POW, surnamed Jung, an infantryman of the 3rd Battalion of the Republic of Korea Army, was captured in 1952. After being handed over to North Korea's security forces by the Chinese side's public security bureau, he was reportedly sent to the Yodok concentration camp. Yoo Young-bok, a POW who escaped from North Korea in 2000, first published his memoirs in 2010, entitled Under Starry Nights in Hell. He wrote under a pseudonym, Yoo Young- chul. In 2012 his memoirs were translated into English under the title Tears of Blood: A Korean POW's Fight for Freedom, Family, and Justice. He also contributed expert testimony for the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK in 2013. The Database Center for North Korean Human Rights in Seoul Korea (nkdb.org) has published a detailed report based on in-depth interviews with 20 of the former POWs who have escaped to South Korea. The interviews cover their capture, their treatment as POWs during and after the war, their lives in North Korea, their escape from North Korea, and their readjustment to life in South Korea. Former POWs receive back pay and pensions for their military service from the South Korean government once they reach South Korea. This adds up to a significant payment and is much higher than the assistance that typical North Korean refugees receive when they successfully reach South Korea. Information about the South Korea's policy toward former POWs has circulated among POWs in North Korea and that has encouraged them to try to leave. Private \\"brokers\\" are also aware of such policies and actively seek former POWs in North Korea and help arrange their escape for hefty fees. There are NGOs that help former POWs and their families in South Korea. The former POWs are generally happy with their new lives in South Korea. However, many suffer from health problems due to many years of hard labor and depression from concern for their family members who are still in North Korea. Getting their remaining family members out of North Korea is a top priority.

Life He was a native of Suffolk and brother of William May. He matriculated as a pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, on 2 May 1544. He was appointed bible-clerk of his college, and in 1550 proceeded B.A., being elected fellow in 1550. He commenced M.A. in 1553, and acted as bursar of the college during 1553, 1554, and 1555. Queens' was split in religious sympathies in the Marian period, and May belonged to the Catholic group rather than the reformers.Norman Leslie Jones, The English Reformation: religion and cultural adaptation (2002), p. 122. At midsummer 1557, he was ordained priest, and on 16 November following he was instituted to the rectory of Aston Sandford, Buckinghamshire, owned by Edward de Vere,http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=62521 resigning in 1558. In 1559 he was elected to the mastership of Catharine Hall, Cambridge. In 1560 he commenced B.D., and was collated to the rectory of Long Stanton St. Michael, Cambridgeshire. In 1562 Archbishop Matthew Parker collated him to the rectory of North Creake, Norfolk; and he held also the moiety of the rectory of Darfield, Yorkshire. About 1564 he obtained a canonry of Ely, which he held until May 1582. Also, in 1564 he was created D.D. In 1565 he was nominated one of the Lent preachers at court. On 26 September in that year he was collated by Archbishop Parker to the rectory of St. Dunstan-in-the East, London, which he vacated in January 1574. He was admitted to the archdeaconry of the East Riding of Yorkshire by proxy on 3 August 1569, in person on 8 October 1571, and retained it until the end of 1588. He served the office of vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge for the year from November 1569, and was in a commission to visit King's College, Cambridge, in a state of confusion over the conduct of Dr. Philip Baker, the Provost. Through the influence of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, May was raised to the see of Carlisle, being consecrated on 29 September 1577. He obtained the Queen's licence to hold his other preferments in commendam, but had long-term financial troubles. From his correspondence with Shrewsbury, he appears to have taken a serious interest in Scottish affairs. On 15 February 1593, the Queen presented William Holland to the rectory of North Creake, which May still held, and there arose a suit in the Queen's bench; it was held that the rectory might be treated as void by reason of May having been subsequently inducted to Darfield. May died at Rose Castle on 15 February 1598, being about seventy years of age. He was buried at Carlisle, according to the parish register of Dalston, Cumbria, a few hours after his death, which was probably caused by the plague. Works May wrote some plays, now lost, which were acted by the members of Queens' College in 1551 and 1553. He was concerned in the compilation of the statutes given to the university by Elizabeth in 1570. Among the Tanner manuscripts in the Bodleian Library are some notes of a sermon which he preached at Paul's Cross in 1565. Family His wife was Amy, daughter of William Vowel of Creake Abbey, Norfolk, and widow of John Cowel of Lancashire. By her he had issue: John of Shouldham, Norfolk, who married Cordelia, daughter of Martin Bowes of Norfolk; Elizabeth, wife of Richard Bird, D.D.; Alice, wife of Richard Burton of Burton, Yorkshire; and Anne, wife of Richard Pilkington, D.D., rector of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire.

The order to form JG 301 was issued on 26 September 1943 and formed on 1 October 1943 in Neubiberg with Stab and three Gruppen (groups) as a \\"Wilde Sau\\" (wild boar) single-seat night fighter unit. The Geschwader was equipped with the Bf 109G and was reorganised with four Staffeln per Gruppe. Jagdgeschwader 50, a specialist anti-Mosquito unit, was disbanded in October 1943 and absorbed into I./JG 301. II./JG 301 was redesignated as II./JG 302 on 30 September 1944 and replaced by I./JG 302. II./JG 7 was attached to IV./JG 301 on 24 November 1944 and disbanded on 19 January 1945.  1943  During October 1943, while I./JG 301 was formed in Neubiberg, II./JG 301 was formed at Altenburg from elements of II./JG 300. Without its own contingent of fighters, II./JG 301 had to share aircraft that belonged to I./JG 11. In November 1943, the unit was designated as II./JG 302. III./JG 301 was initially raised in October 1943 at Zerbst, but became III./JG 300 during the same month. III./JG 301 was again reformed at Zerbst in November 1943, but was disbanded in May 1944. JG 301's first Geschwaderkommodore, Oberstleutnant Helmut Weinrich was killed on the night of 18/19 November 1943. Weinrich, a Knight's Cross recipient while serving with Kampfgeschwader 30, crashed after his engine exploded during the landing approach to Frankfurt-Rhein-Main. He shot down a bomber, but his Focke-Wulf Fw 190A-5 sustained heavy damage from return fire.Obermaier 1989, p. 221.  1944  By January 1944, JG 301's establishment was Stab./JG 301 (2 Bf 109G-6), I./JG 301 (26 Bf 109G-6), II./JG 301 (3 Bf 109G-6), and III./JG 301 (30 Bf 109G-6). In March 1944, 30. Jagddivision (of which JG 301 was a part) was switched to day fighting as a part of Reichsverteidigung (Defense of the Reich). Occasionally, night sorties were still flown. On 24/25 March 1944, I./JG 301 and III./JG 301 engaged RAF Bomber Command formations. Ofw. Hans Todt of 1. Staffel claimed two Lancasters, while Fw. Sieghart of 7. Staffel claimed another. III./JG 301 lost Oblt. Kurt Medinn (8. Staffel) who was killed in combat after shooting down a bomber. Before switching from night operations to purely day interception, units losses exceeded those claimed; however, most losses were not combat-related but were due to poor weather or flying accidents.'Jagdgeschwader 301/301 \\"Wilde Sau\\"'; Willi Reschke Schiffer, 2004 Elements of JG 301 then joined defences around the vital oil installations at Ploie»ôti in Romania. On 24 April 1944, I./JG 301 attacked elements of a United States Army Air Force (USAAF) bomber formation near Munich, downing 4 B-17s. Eight P-51s of the escorting 355th Fighter Group immediately engaged JG 301 in a running battle. Stab./JG 301 and I./JG 301 lost 6 Bf 190G-6s shot down, with 3 killed and 3 wounded. The Gruppenkommandeur Major Walter Bredensbach was badly wounded and crash landed his Bf 109 at Holzkirchen airfield. 480 bombers of the 15th Air Force attacked Ploie»ôti on 31 May 1944. III./JG 77, I./JG 53, and JG 301's 6. and 10. Staffeln intercepted the raid. The Luftwaffe lost 12 planes, 10./JG 301 losing 4 aircraft (and 3 killed). The German fighters claimed 10 heavies and 4 escorts in return, with 10./ JG 301's Fw. Kiehling claiming one P-38 and 6./ JG 301 collectively claiming one B-24, with 2 B-24's badly damaged. The USAAF lost 12 B-24 bombers, 2 P-51s (of the 52nd Fighter Group) and 2 P-38s (of the 1st Fighter Group). On 6 June 1944 570 bombers, with fighter escort hit the Belgrade marshalling yard and Turnu-Severin canal installations, while B-24s attacked the Ploie»ôti refineries and the marshalling yard at Brasov. II./JG 301 and 10. Staffel JG 301, with JG 53 and III./JG 77 countered the raids. Fw. Gerhard Zeisler (of 10./ JG 301) claimed one B-24 shot down over Tagoviste for his third victory, but was then shot down in his Bf 109 G-6. II./ JG 301 claimed one B-24, while the 15th Air Force lost 1 B-17, 13 B-24s and 2 P-51s. On 23 June 1944 400 B-17s and B-24s again attacked oil targets in Romania. Aircraft of 6./JG 301 tangled with Mustangs over Bucharest, Ofw. Max Suzgruber claiming one victory. 6. and 10. Staffel hit the attacking bombers, and Uffz. Brenner claimed one B-24 shot down. Two 109s were lost from 10./ JG 301, in return for 6 B-17s, 3 B-24s and 4 P-51s lost. The 15th Air Force returned to Bucharest on 28 June with 228 bombers. A response from 120 fighters of III./ JG 77, I./ JG 53, II. and IV./ JG 301 claimed 9 B-24s and 3 P-51s. 6./ JG 301 and 10. Staffel each shot down one B-24. The USAAF lost only 3 B-24s, all from the 485th Bombardment Group. The Luftwaffe lost 20 aircraft to the Mustang fighter cover. A Messerschmitt Bf 109 of Jagdgeschwader 301. Photographed in British hands after landing by accident at an RAF airfield July 21,1944, after a Wilde Sau sortie In June 1944 I Gruppe moved westwards to St. Dizier and later to Epinoy. In the early hours of 21 July Lt. Horst Prenzel (Staffelkapitan 1./JG 301) landed his Bf 109G-6 at RAF Manston by mistake after a 'Wilde Sau' sortie over the invasion area. The RAF evaluated the aircraft at the RAE Farnborough, and then passed to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Wittering in August 1944. The same night Fw Manfred Gromil of 1./JG 301 belly landed his G-6 at Manston, due to lack of fuel. After re-equipping with the Focke-Wulf 190 A-8, I./JG 302 was redesignated as III./JG 301 on 30 September 1944. In October the unit transferred to Stendal, near Berlin. On 26 November 1944 JG 301 intercepted three USAAF B-24 bomber formations strung out on a 40-mile front due to a navigation error, around Misburg. Splitting into smaller groups, the fighters attacked in waves from the rear. The 491st Bombardment Group lost 15 B-24‚Äôs to JG 301's Fw 190 A-8s before the P-51 escort fighters could intervene. Shortly afterwards JG 301 attacked the 445th Bombardment Group. The initial wave shot down at least 5 bombers before the escorts responded, hitting the Geschwader's second wave. JG 301 claimed some 58 bombers shot down; Oberfeldwebel Hans M√ºller (2. Staffel) claimed three B-24 Liberators shot down, Lt. Anton Benning a B-24 and a P-51, while Obfw Josef Keil of 10 Staffel claimed two more B-24s. The USAAF escort fighters of the 355th and 339th Fighter Groups and the 2nd Scouting Force claimed 53 victories for JG 301's worst single day loss in the war, with some 38 pilots of the unit being killed or wounded and 51 Fw 190s lost in action or written off.( Lost 70...100% 48 Fw's plus 50...65% 7 Fw's, 10...45% 9 Fw's ) The next day I. and II. gruppe, JG 301 lost another 14 Fw 190As, with 7 killed and 4 wounded. The unit's establishment by 30 November 1944 was thus; Stab JG 301; (4 Fw 190 A-9) I./ JG 301; (5 Fw 190 A-8, 18 Fw 190 A-9) II./ JG 301; (10 Fw 190 A-8/R6, 11 Fw 190 A-8/R11, 15 Fw 190 A-9/R 11) III./ JG 301; (50 Fw 190 A-8.) On 17 December 1944 JG 301 again attacked the USAAF bomber streams near Hannover. I. and II. Gruppe attacked the escorting fighters while III. Gruppe attacked the bombers. Fw. Reschke claimed one B-24 and one P-51 over G√∂ttingen, Ofw. Hans Todt shot down one P-47 while Uffz. Brenner shot down a B-24. Two JG 301 aircraft were lost, for one killed.  1945  On 14 January 1945 JG 301 lost 20 pilots killed and 8 wounded as they were attacked by the massed USAAF escort fighters during an operation with JG 300 against the US bomber formations over central Germany. The day marked the first 'Dora 9' loss, from the Geschwader Stabschwarm. The two Geschwaders downed 18 B-17s, 7 P-51s and one P-47. Ta 152s of III. Gruppe In early March 1945 Stab./JG 301 became the first unit to receive the Focke-Wulf Ta 152, with an operational brief to provide top cover for the Jagdwaffe airfields in the area. The first Ta 152 combat sorties were flown on 8 February. On 18 February the Stab moved to Sachau, near Berlin and on 21 February intercepted US bombers, with Oberfeldwebel Josef Keil claiming a B-17 shot down over Berlin. On 1 March Keil claimed a P-51 over the same area. The final victims of the Ta 152 were Soviet Yak-9s during the final days of the battle around Berlin on 30 April 1945. Encountering fighters on several occasions, the Schwarm lost only two pilots, but shot down at least 9 aircraft. Obfw Josef Keil (11 victories) became the first and only Ta 152 ace, claiming six Allied fighters, while Obfw Willi Reschke claimed the other three. By April JG 301 was based around Hagenow, Neustadt and Ludwigslust. III./JG 301 were also beginning to be equipped with Ta 152's, although full equipment was not completed before the war's end. =Geschwaderkommodore= *Oberstleutnant Helmut Weinreich, October 1943 - 19 November 1943 *Major Manfred M√∂ssinger, 19 November 1943 - September 1944 *Oberstleutnant Fritz Aufhammer, September 1944 - May 1945 *Oberstleutnant Helmut Wilhelm Eckrich 1942 ‚Äì Juli 1945 =Gruppenkommandeure= I.

Hongeo-hoe is made from skate and emits a very strong, characteristic ammonia- like odor that has been described as being \\"reminiscent of an outhouse\\". Origin Skates (hongeo) are cartilaginous fish that excrete uric acid through the skin, rather than by urinating as other animals do. As they ferment, ammonia is produced which helps preserve the flesh and gives the fish its distinctive, powerful odor. The natural preservative effect of the fermentation process on skate meat was noted by Korean fishermen as early as the 14th century, during the Goryeo dynasty, long before refrigeration was invented. It was found that skates were the only fish that could be transported over long distances or stored for extended periods without rotting, even in the absence of salt. Production Originally, the skates used in the production of hongeo-hoe were harvested locally from the waters around Heuksando, an island off the southwestern coast of Korea. In more recent years, a larger proportion has been made with less expensive imported fish, mainly from Chile, although skate from Heuksando still retains a reputation for superior quality. Specific production techniques vary from shop to shop, influenced in part by the local climate. According to the traditional method, after the fish are cleaned and eviscerated, they would be stored either in compost (in cold regions) or in piles of straw (in warmer regions) and left to ferment. In the present day, due to concerns over food safety and product consistency, the use of refrigeration has become more common. Under one modern method, the fish undergo fermentation in a walk-in refrigerator for as much as 15 days at 2.5 ¬∞C, and then for approximately 15 more days at 1 ¬∞C. After fermentation, the preserved skates are sliced into small pieces and packed into boxes for shipment. Eating Hongeo-hoe is typically presented to diners as small slabs, sashimi-style, without being subjected to cooking or further preparation.

Football career McCall was born in Maxwelltown, then a separate burgh from Dumfries across the River Nith. While a pupil at Glasgow Street School, he was the captain of the Scottish Schoolboys' team. He served in the Great War with the 5th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers, and after the war returned to football, and the Maxwelltown Juniors (known locally as the \\"Fish Suppers\\"). Joining Queen of the South in 1919, the year of their formation, he played for Queen's as a forward during his stay at Palmerston. McCall made 24 appearances in season 1919‚Äì20 scoring 11 goals and ten appearances in season 1920‚Äì21 scoring three goals. McCall was a goalscorer along with left winger, Dave Halliday, for then non-league Queen of the South as they won the Dumfries Charity Cup Final in 1920 defeating Dalbeattie Star. This was the first ever trophy win for fledgling Queens. McCall moved from Queen of the South to Blackburn Rovers in December 1920. McCall was one of the three players to make such a move in a short time frame along with Jimmy McKinnell and Tom Wylie. This along with the transfer of Ian Dickson to Aston Villa helped fund Queens' purchase of Palmerston Park. McCall made only 11 league appearances for Blackburn before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers in June 1922. After six months at Molineux, McCall moved to the south coast to join Southampton in January 1923 in an exchange deal with George Getgood joining Wolves. McCall had a reputation for being quick and scored on his debut at The Dell against Coventry City on 10 February. Although McCall scored again in March, he lost his place to Len Andrews and soon became disillusioned. He left the club in May 1923 and was transfer listed at ¬£500. It was not until September 1925 that he eventually found a new club, back with Queen of the South, at a reduced fee of ¬£250. McCall finished his professional playing career with Carlisle United. Later career He became trainer for a local team in Dumfries, Troqueer Juniors. McCall worked with the Caledonian bus company at their Eastfield Road premises in Dumfries. Aged 68 he died in Dumfries Infirmary. He was survived by his wife, son and married daughter. His son flew into Prestwick Airport for the funeral from Canada where he had been living for 11 years.

MƒÅori originated with settlers from eastern Polynesia, who arrived in New Zealand in several waves of (canoe) voyages between roughly 1320 and 1350. Over several centuries in isolation, these settlers developed their own distinctive culture, whose language, mythology, crafts and performing arts evolved independently from those of other eastern Polynesian cultures. Some early MƒÅori moved to the Chatham Islands where their descendants became New Zealand's other indigenous Polynesian ethnic group, the Moriori. The arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, starting in the 17th century, brought enormous changes to the MƒÅori way of life. MƒÅori people gradually adopted many aspects of Western society and culture. Initial relations between MƒÅori and Europeans were largely amicable, and with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, the two cultures coexisted. Rising tensions over disputed land sales led to conflict in the 1860s, and massive land confiscations. Social upheaval, and epidemics of introduced disease took a devastating toll on the MƒÅori population, which fell dramatically. By the start of the 20th century, the MƒÅori population had begun to recover, and efforts have been made to increase their standing in wider New Zealand society and achieve social justice. Traditional MƒÅori culture has thereby enjoyed a significant revival, which was further bolstered by a MƒÅori protest movement that emerged in the 1960s. However, disproportionate numbers of MƒÅori face significant economic and social obstacles, and generally have lower life expectancies and incomes compared with other New Zealand ethnic groups. They suffer higher levels of crime, health problems, and educational under-achievement. A number of socioeconomic initiatives have been instigated with the aim of \\"closing the gap\\" between MƒÅori and other New Zealanders. Political and economic redress for historical grievances is also ongoing (see Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements). In the 2018 census, there were 775,836 people in New Zealand identifying as MƒÅori, making up 16.5 per cent of the national population. They are the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand, after European New Zealanders (\\"PƒÅkehƒÅ\\"). In addition, more than 140,000 MƒÅori live in Australia. The MƒÅori language is spoken to some extent by about a fifth of all MƒÅori, representing 3 per cent of the total population. MƒÅori are active in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.  Etymology  In the MƒÅori language, the word means \\"normal\\", \\"natural\\" or \\"ordinary\\". In legends and oral traditions, the word distinguished ordinary mortal human beings‚Äî‚Äîfrom deities and spirits ().Atkinson, A. S. (1892).\\"What is a Tangata Maori?\\" Journal of the Polynesian Society, 1 (3), 133‚Äì136. Retrieved 18 December 2007. Likewise, denotes \\"fresh water\\", as opposed to salt water. There are cognate words in most Polynesian languages,e.g. , meaning native Hawaiian. (In the Hawaiian language, the Polynesian letter \\"T\\" regularly becomes a \\"K,\\" and the Polynesian letter \\"R\\" regularly becomes an \\"L\\") all deriving from Proto- Polynesian , which has the reconstructed meaning \\"true, real, genuine\\".Eastern Polynesian languages  Naming and self-naming  Early visitors from Europe to New Zealand generally referred to the indigenous inhabitants as \\"New Zealanders\\" or as \\"natives\\". The MƒÅori used the term to describe themselves in a pan-tribal sense. MƒÅori people often use the term (literally, \\"people of the land\\") to identify in a way that expresses their relationship with a particular area of land; a tribe may be the in one area, but not in another. The term can also refer to the MƒÅori people as a whole in relation to New Zealand () as a whole. Who is considered MƒÅori has not always been clear from a PƒÅkehƒÅ perspective. For electoral purposes before 1974, the government required documented ancestry to determine the status of \\"a MƒÅori person\\" and only those with at least 50% MƒÅori ancestry were allowed to choose which seats they wished to vote in. The MƒÅori Affairs Amendment Act 1974 changed this, allowing individuals to self-identify as to their cultural identity. Similarly, until 1986 the census required at least 50 per cent MƒÅori 'blood' to claim MƒÅori affiliation. Currently in all contexts authorities generally require some documentation of ancestry or continuing cultural connection (such as acceptance by others as being of the people); but no minimum \\"blood\\" requirement.McIntosh (2005), p. 45  History  = Origins from Polynesia = island-hopping voyages in the South Pacific. No credible evidence exists of pre-MƒÅori settlement of New Zealand; on the other hand, compelling evidence from archaeology, linguistics, and physical anthropology indicates that the first settlers migrated from Polynesia and became the MƒÅori. Evidence indicates that their ancestry (as part of the larger group of Austronesian peoples) stretches back 5,000 years, to the indigenous peoples of Taiwan. Polynesian people settled a large area encompassing Samoa, Tahiti, Hawai ªi, Easter Island () ‚Äì and finally New Zealand. There may have been some exploration and settlement before eruption of Mount Tarawera in about 1315, based on finds of bones from Polynesian rats and rat-gnawed shells, and evidence of widespread forest fires in the decade or so earlier; but the most recent evidence points to the main settlement occurring as a planned mass migration somewhere between 1320 and 1350. This broadly aligns with analyses from MƒÅori oral traditions, which describe the arrival of ancestors in a number of large ocean-going canoes () in around 1350. = Early history = Early Archaic period objects from the Wairau Bar archaeological site, on display at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch The earliest period of MƒÅori settlement, known as the \\"Archaic\\", \\"Moahunter\\" or \\"Colonisation\\" period, dates from to . The early MƒÅori diet included an abundance of moa and other large birds and fur seals that had never been hunted before. This Archaic period is known for its distinctive \\"reel necklaces\\",\\"Nga Kakano: 1100 ‚Äì 1300\\", Te Papa and also remarkable for the lack of weapons and fortifications typical of the later \\"Classic\\" MƒÅori.\\"The Moa Hunters\\", 1966, An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand The best-known and most extensively studied Archaic site, at Wairau Bar in the South Island,\\"Maori Colonisation\\".

Factors that operated in the transition to the Classic period (the culture at the time of European contact) include a significantly cooler period from 1500, and the extinction of the moa and of other food species. The Classic period is characterised by finely-made (greenstone) weapons and ornaments; elaborately carved war canoes and (meeting houses).Neich Roger, 2001. Carved Histories: Rotorua Ngati Tarawhai Woodcarving. Auckland: Auckland University Press, pp 48‚Äì49. A fierce warrior culture included hillforts known as HONGI HIKA (c. 1780‚Äì1828) Ngapuhi war chief, An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand. and cannibalism.James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume II, 1922. Around the year 1500 a group of MƒÅori migrated east to the Chatham Islands and developed into a people known as the Moriori, with pacifism a key part of their culture. = Contact with Europeans = Murderers' Bay in Abel Tasman's travel journal (1642) The first European explorers to New Zealand were Abel Tasman, who arrived in 1642; Captain James Cook, in 1769; and Marion du Fresne in 1772. Initial contact between MƒÅori and Europeans proved problematic and sometimes fatal, with Tasman having four of his men killed and probably killing at least one MƒÅori - without ever landing. Cook's men shot at least eight MƒÅori within three days of his first landing, although he later had good relations with MƒÅori. Three years later, after a promising start, du Fresne and 26 men of his crew were killed. From the 1780s, MƒÅori also increasingly encountered European and American sealers, whalers and Christian missionaries. Relations were mostly peaceful, although marred by several further violent incidents, the worst of which was the Boyd massacre and subsequent revenge attacks.Ingram, C. W. N. (1984). New Zealand Shipwrecks 1975‚Äì1982. Auckland: New Zealand Consolidated Press; pp 3‚Äì6, 9, 12. European settlement in New Zealand began in the early 19th century, leading to an extensive sharing of culture and ideas. Many MƒÅori valued Europeans, whom they called \\"\\", as a means to acquire Western knowledge and technology. MƒÅori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form. The introduction of the potato revolutionised agriculture, and the acquisition of muskets by MƒÅori led to a period of particularly bloody intertribal warfare known as the Musket Wars, in which many groups were decimated and others driven from their traditional territory. The pacifist Moriori in the Chatham Islands similarly suffered massacre and subjugation in an invasion by some Taranaki . At the same time, the MƒÅori suffered high mortality rates from Eurasian infectious diseases, such as influenza, smallpox and measles, which killed an estimated 10 to 50 per cent of MƒÅori. Depiction of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, bringing New Zealand and the MƒÅori into the British Empire By 1839, estimates placed the number of Europeans living in New Zealand as high as 2,000, and the British Crown acceded to repeated requests from missionaries and some MƒÅori chiefs () to intervene. The British government sent Royal Navy Captain William Hobson to negotiate a treaty between the British Crown and the MƒÅori, which became known as the Treaty of Waitangi. Starting from February 1840, this treaty was signed by the Crown and 500 MƒÅori chiefs from across New Zealand. The Treaty gave MƒÅori the rights of British subjects and guaranteed MƒÅori property rights and tribal autonomy, in return for accepting British sovereignty and the annexation of New Zealand as a colony in the British Empire. However, disputes continue over aspects of the Treaty of Waitangi, including wording differences in the two versions (in English and MƒÅori), as well as misunderstandings of different cultural concepts. Nevertheless, relations between MƒÅori and Europeans during the early colonial period were largely peaceful. Many MƒÅori groups set up substantial businesses, supplying food and other products for domestic and overseas markets. When violence did break out, as in the Wairau Affray, Flagstaff War, Hutt Valley Campaign and Wanganui Campaign it was generally limited and concluded with a peace treaty. However, by the 1860s rising settler numbers and tensions over disputed land purchases led to the later New Zealand wars, fought by the colonial government against numerous MƒÅori using local and British Imperial troops, and some allied . These conflicts resulted in the colonial government confiscating tracts of MƒÅori land as punishment for what were called \\"rebellions\\". PƒÅkehƒÅ (European) settlers would occupy the confiscated land. Several minor conflicts also arose after the wars, including the incident at Parihaka in 1881 and the Dog Tax War from 1897‚Äì98. The Native Land Court was also established to transfer MƒÅori land from communal ownership into individual title as a means to assimilation and to facilitate greater sales to European settlers. = Decline and revival = Members of the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion performing a haka, Egypt (July 1941) By the late 19th century a widespread belief existed amongst both PƒÅkehƒÅ and MƒÅori that the MƒÅori population would cease to exist as a separate race or culture, and become assimilated into the European population.King (2003), p. 224 In the 1896 census, New Zealand had a MƒÅori population of 42,113, by which time Europeans numbered more than 700,000.\\"Population ‚Äì Factors and Trends\\", An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, published in 1966. Retrieved 18 September 2007. However, the decline did not continue and the MƒÅori population continued to recover in the 20th centuries. Influential MƒÅori politicians such as James Carroll, ƒÄpirana Ngata, Te Rangi Hƒ´roa and Maui Pomare aimed to revitalise the MƒÅori people after the devastation of the previous century. They believed the future path called for a degree of assimilation, with MƒÅori adopting European practices such as Western medicine and education (especially learning English), while also retaining traditional cultural practices. MƒÅori also fought during both World Wars in specialised battalions (the MƒÅori Pioneer Battalion in WWI and the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion in WWII). MƒÅori were also badly hit by the 1918 influenza epidemic, with death rates for MƒÅori being 4.5 times higher than for PƒÅkehƒÅ. After World War II, te reo MƒÅori use declined steeply in favour of English. Whina Cooper leading the MƒÅori Land March in 1975, seeking redress for historical grievances Since the 1960s, MƒÅoridom has undergone a cultural revival concurrent with activism for social justice and a protest movement. (MƒÅori language pre-schools) were established in 1982 to promote MƒÅori language use and halt the decline in its use. Two MƒÅori language television channels broadcast content in the MƒÅori language, while words such as \\"\\" have entered widespread use in New Zealand English. Government recognition of the growing political power of MƒÅori and political activism have led to limited redress for historic land confiscations. In 1975 the Crown set up the Waitangi Tribunal to investigate historical grievances, and since the 1990s the New Zealand government has negotiated and finalised treaty settlements with many across New Zealand. By June 2008 the government had provided over NZ$900 million in settlements, much of it in the form of land deals. There is a growing MƒÅori leadership who are using these settlements as an investment platform for economic development. Despite a growing acceptance of MƒÅori culture in wider New Zealand society, treaty settlements have generated significant controversy. Some MƒÅori have argued that the settlements occur at a level of between 1 and 2.5 cents on the dollar of the value of the confiscated lands, and therefore do not represent adequate redress. Conversely, some non-MƒÅori denounce the settlements and socioeconomic initiatives as amounting to race-based preferential treatment. Both of these sentiments were expressed during the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy in 2004.  Demographics  Under the MƒÅori Affairs Amendment Act 1974, a MƒÅori is defined as \\"a person of the MƒÅori race of New Zealand; and includes any descendant of such a person\\". The MƒÅori population around the late 18th century was estimated by James Cook at 100,000. Historian Michael King suggests a slightly higher figure of 110,000 is more likely. Their numbers declined during the 19th century, to as low as 42,000; the decline has been attributed to the impact of European colonisation, including new diseases. Thereafter the population grew rapidly. There were 775,836 people identifying as being part of the MƒÅori ethnic group at the 2018 New Zealand census, making up 16.5% of New Zealand's population. This is an increase of 177,234 people (29.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 210,507 people (37.2%) since the 2006 census. The large increase between the 2013 and 2018 census was mainly due to Statistics New Zealand adding ethnicity data from other sources (previous censuses, administrative data, and imputation) to the 2018 census data to reduce the number of non-responses. There were 383,019 males and 392,820 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.975 males per female. Of the total population, 248,784 people (32.1%) were aged under 15 years, 193,146 (24.9%) were 15 to 29, 285,657 (36.8%) were 30 to 64, and 48,252 (6.2%) were 65 or older. In terms of population distribution, 85.7% of MƒÅori live in the North Island and 14.2% live in the South Island. The Chatham Islands has the highest concentration of MƒÅori people at 66.1%, followed by the Wairoa District (65.7%), ≈åp≈çtiki District (63.7%), Kawerau District (61.7%) and Gisborne District (52.9%). The Upper Harbour local board area in Auckland has the lowest concentration of MƒÅori people at 5.1%, followed by the Queenstown-Lakes District at 5.3%. Of those identifying as MƒÅori at the 2013 census, 278,199 people identified as of sole MƒÅori ethnicity while 260,229 identified as of both European and MƒÅori ethnicity, due to the high rate of intermarriage between the two cultures. The largest by population was NgƒÅpuhi (125,601), followed by NgƒÅti Porou (71,049), NgƒÅi Tahu (54,819) and Waikato (40,083). However, over 110,000 people of MƒÅori descent could not identify their . Outside of New Zealand, a large MƒÅori population exists in Australia, estimated at 155,000 in 2011. In 2007 the MƒÅori Party suggested a special seat should be created in the New Zealand parliament representing MƒÅori in Australia. Smaller communities also exist in the United Kingdom (approx. 8,000), the United States (up to 3,500) and Canada (approx. 1,000).New Zealand-born figures from the 2000 U.S. Census; maximum figure represents sum of \\"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\\" and people of mixed race.

Culture  ≈åhinemutu village, Rotorua ( on the top) MƒÅori culture forms a distinctive part of New Zealand culture and, due to a large diaspora and the incorporation of MƒÅori motifs into popular culture, is found throughout the world. Contemporary MƒÅori culture comprises traditional as well as 20th-century influences. = Traditional culture = A MƒÅori chief with tattoos () seen by James Cook and his crew Julius von Haast incorrectly interpreted the earliest archaeological remains as belonging to a pre-MƒÅori Paleolithic people; later researchers, notably Percy Smith, magnified such theories into an elaborate scenario with a series of sharply-defined cultural stages which had MƒÅori arriving in a Great Fleet in 1350 and replacing the so-called \\"moa-hunter\\" culture with a \\"classic MƒÅori\\" culture based on horticulture.Howe (2006), pp 25‚Äì40 However, the archaeological record indicates a gradual evolution of culture..Howe (2003), p. 161 In the course of a few centuries, the growing population led to competition for resources and an increase in warfare and an increased frequency of fortified pƒÅ. Various systems also arose aimed to conserve resources; most of these, such as and , used religious or supernatural threats to discourage people from taking species at particular seasons or from specified areas. Warfare between tribes was common, and MƒÅori would sometimes eat their conquered enemies. Performing arts such as the haka developed from their Polynesian roots, as did carving and weaving. Regional dialects arose, with differences in vocabulary and in the pronunciation of some words but the language retained enough similarities to other Eastern Polynesian languages for Tupaia, the Tahitian navigator on James Cook's first voyage in the region to act as an interpreter between MƒÅori and the crew of the Endeavour. = Belief and religion = Traditional MƒÅori beliefs have their origins in Polynesian culture. Polynesian concepts such as (sacred), (non-sacred), (authority/prestige) and (spirit) governed everyday MƒÅori living and there were many MƒÅori deities. Today, MƒÅori follow many Christian faiths including Presbyterianism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), MƒÅori Christian groups such as RƒÅtana and Ringat≈´\\", and also Catholic, Anglican and Methodist grouping.Hume, Tim. \\"Muslim faith draws converts from NZ prisons.\\" Star Times Islam is estimated as the fastest growing religion among MƒÅori, yet MƒÅori Muslims constitute a very small proportion of MƒÅori. At the 2013 New Zealand census, 8.8 per cent of MƒÅori were affiliated with MƒÅori Christian denominations and 39.6 per cent with other Christian denominations; 46.3 per cent of MƒÅori claimed no religion. Proportions of Christian and irreligious MƒÅori are comparable with European New Zealanders. Many MƒÅori people still observe spiritual traditions such as and . Certain objects, areas, or buildings are (spiritually restricted), and must be made (unrestricted) by ceremonial action. It is common practice, for instance, to remove one's shoes before entering a (meeting-house) in token of respect for the ancestors who are represented and spiritually present within the . Another spiritual ritual is (purification), practised when fishing to ensure there is no on the fish. A young man performing in a group at a Rotorua tourist venue = Performing arts = Cultural performance of (song), (dance), (chants) and (poetry) are used by MƒÅori to express and pass on knowledge and understanding about history, communities and relationships. is a MƒÅori performance art that originated in the 1880s to perform to tourists including some groups travelling out of New Zealand to perform. It was used in the First World War to raise money for the Maori Soldiers‚Äô Fund encouraged by Apirana Ngata. A is often performed in a (welcoming ceremony). Since 1972 there has been a regular national competition, the Te Matatini National Festival, organised by the Aotearoa Traditional MƒÅori Performing Arts Society. There are groups in schools, tertiary institutions and workplaces, and it is performed at tourist venues across the country. (entertainment houses) were a site of story- telling, dance and puppetry in pre-European MƒÅori culture. MƒÅori theatre and contemporary dance flourished in the 1970s and 1980s with groups such as Te Ohu Whakaari, Te Ika a Maui Players and Taki Rua. Contemporary MƒÅori stage writers and actors include George Henare, Riwia Brown, Hone Kouka, Nancy Brunning, Jim Moriarty, Briar Grace-Smith and many others. = Literature and media = Like other cultures, oral folklore was used by MƒÅori to preserve their stories and beliefs across many centuries. In the 19th century, European-style literacy was brought to the MƒÅori, which led to MƒÅori history documentation in books, novels and later television. MƒÅori language use began to decline in the 20th century with English as the language through which MƒÅori literature became widespread. Notable MƒÅori novelists include Patricia Grace, Witi Ihimaera and Alan Duff. Once Were Warriors, a 1994 film adapted from a 1990 novel of the same name by Alan Duff, brought the plight of some urban MƒÅori to a wide audience. It was the highest-grossing film in New Zealand until 2006, and received international acclaim, winning several international film prizes. While some MƒÅori feared that viewers would consider the violent male characters an accurate portrayal of MƒÅori men, most critics praised it as exposing the raw side of domestic violence. Taika Waititi at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con Well-known MƒÅori film actors include Temuera Morrison, Cliff Curtis, Lawrence Makoare, Manu Bennett, and Keisha Castle- Hughes. They appear in films such as Whale Rider, Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, The Matrix, King Kong, River Queen, The Lord of The Rings, Rapa Nui, and others, and famous television series like Xena: Warrior Princess, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, The Lost World and Spartacus: Blood and Sand. In most cases their roles in Hollywood productions have them portraying ethnic groups other than MƒÅori. In the 2010s MƒÅori actor-director Taika Waititi rose to global fame with the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Thor: Ragnarok, in which he played an alien named Korg, and the Academy Award- winning Jojo Rabbit, in which he played Adolf Hitler as imagined by a ten- year-old Hitler Youth member. Waititi's previous films include Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, both of which feature young MƒÅori protagonists. = Sport = haka performed by the national rugby union team before a game MƒÅori participate fully in New Zealand's sporting culture, and are well- represented in rugby union, rugby league and netball teams at all levels. As well as participation in national sports teams, there are MƒÅori rugby union, rugby league and cricket representative teams that play in international competitions. At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, 41 of the 199 competitors (20.5 per cent) were of MƒÅori descent in the New Zealand delegation, with the rugby sevens squads alone having 17 MƒÅori competitors (out of 24). There were also three competitors of MƒÅori descent in the Australian delegation. The New Zealand national rugby union team and many other New Zealand sports people perform a , a traditional MƒÅori challenge, before events. Ki-o-rahi and tapawai are two ball sports of MƒÅori origin. Ki- o-rahi received an unexpected boost when McDonald's chose it to represent New Zealand. Waka ama (outrigger canoeing) has also experienced a resurgence of interest in New Zealand since the 1980s.  Language  thumbalt=Map of New Zealand showing the percentage of people in each census area unit who speak MƒÅori. Areas of the North Island exhibit the highest MƒÅori proficiency.Speakers of MƒÅori according to the 2013 census The MƒÅori language, also known as (pronounced [ÀàmaÀêo…æi, te Àà…æeo ÀàmaÀêo…æi]) or simply (\\"the language\\"), has the status of an official language. Linguists classify it within the Eastern Polynesian languages as being closely related to Cook Islands MƒÅori, Tuamotuan and Tahitian. Before European contact MƒÅori did not have a written language and \\"important information such as was memorised and passed down verbally through the generations\\".Joyce, B. and Mathers, B. (2006). Whakapapa. An introduction to Maori family history research. Published by the Maori Interest Group of the NZSG Inc. MƒÅori were familiar with the concept of maps and when interacting with missionaries in 1815 could draw accurate maps of their ( boundaries), onto paper, that were the equal of European maps. Missionaries surmised that MƒÅori had traditionally drawn maps on sand or other natural materials.He Korero. A.Jones and K.Jenkins. Huia.2011 From about 1890, MƒÅori members of Parliament realised the importance of English literacy to MƒÅori and insisted that all MƒÅori children be taught in English. Missionaries, who still ran many MƒÅori schools, had been teaching exclusively in MƒÅori but the MƒÅori MPs insisted this should stop. However attendance at school for many MƒÅori was intermittent. In many areas of New Zealand, MƒÅori lost its role as a living community language used by significant numbers of people in the post-war years. In tandem with calls for sovereignty and for the righting of social injustices from the 1970s onwards, New Zealand schools now teach MƒÅori culture and language as an option, and pre-school (\\"language-nests\\") have started, which teach (young children) exclusively in MƒÅori. These extend right through secondary schools (). Most preschool centres teach basics such as colours, numerals and greetings in MƒÅori songs and chants. MƒÅori Television, a government-funded channel committed to broadcasting primarily in Te Reo, began in March 2004. The 1996 census reported 160,000 MƒÅori speakers. (revised 2007) At the time of the 2013 census 125,352 MƒÅori (21.3 per cent) reported a conversational level of proficiency.  Society  = Historical development = Polynesian settlers in New Zealand developed a distinct society over several hundred years. Social groups were tribal, with no unified society or single MƒÅori identity until after the arrival of Europeans. Nevertheless, common elements could be found in all MƒÅori groups in pre-European New Zealand, including a shared Polynesian heritage, a common basic language, familial associations, traditions of warfare, and similar mythologies and religious beliefs.King (1996), pp 37, 43 Most MƒÅori lived in villages, which were inhabited by several (extended families) who collectively formed a (clan or subtribe). Members of a cooperated with food production, gathering resources, raising families and defence. MƒÅori society across New Zealand was broadly stratified into three classes of people: , chiefs and ruling families; , commoners; and , slaves. also held special standing in their communities as specialists of revered arts, skills and esoteric knowledge.King (1996), pp 42‚Äì3 Shared ancestry, intermarriage and trade strengthened relationships between different groups. Many with mutually-recognised shared ancestry formed , or tribes, which were the largest social unit in MƒÅori society. and often united for expeditions to gather food and resources, or in times of conflict. In contrast, warfare developed as an integral part of traditional life, as different groups competed for food and resources, settled personal disputes, and sought to increase their prestige and authority. MƒÅori whƒÅnau from Rotorua in the 1880s. Many aspects of Western life and culture, including European clothing and architecture, became incorporated into MƒÅori society during the 19th century. Early European settlers introduced tools, weapons, clothing and foods to MƒÅori across New Zealand, in exchange for resources, land and labour. MƒÅori began selectively adopting elements of Western society during the 19th century, including European clothing and food, and later Western education, religion and architecture.King (1996), pp 46‚Äì7, 73‚Äì5 However, as the 19th century wore on, relations between European colonial settlers and different MƒÅori groups became increasingly strained. Tensions led to widespread conflict in the 1860s, and the confiscation of millions of acres of MƒÅori land. Significant amounts of land were also purchased by the colonial government and later through the Native Land Court.  20th century  By the start of the 20th century, a greater awareness had emerged of a unified MƒÅori identity, particularly in comparison to PƒÅkehƒÅ, who now overwhelmingly outnumbered the MƒÅori as a whole. MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ societies remained largely separate‚Äîsocially, culturally, economically and geographically‚Äîfor much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.King (1996), pp 195‚Äì6 The key reason for this was that MƒÅori remained almost exclusively a rural population, whereas increasingly the European population was urban especially after 1900. Nevertheless, MƒÅori groups continued to engage with the government and in legal processes to increase their standing in (and ultimately further their incorporation into) wider New Zealand society.Hill (2009), pp 519‚Äì29 The main point of contact with the government were the four MƒÅori Members of Parliament. Many MƒÅori migrated to larger rural towns and cities during the Depression and post-WWII periods in search of employment, leaving rural communities depleted and disconnecting many urban MƒÅori from their traditional social controls and tribal homelands. Yet while standards of living improved among MƒÅori, they continued to lag behind PƒÅkehƒÅ in areas such as health, income, skilled employment and access to higher levels of education. MƒÅori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems.Sorrenson (1997), pp 339‚Äì41 In regards to housing, a 1961 census revealed significant differences in the living conditions of MƒÅori and Europeans. That year, out of all the (unshared) non-MƒÅori private dwellings in New Zealand, 96.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 94.1 per cent a hot water service, 88.7 per cent a flush toilet, 81.6 per cent a refrigerator, and 78.6 per cent an electric washing machine. By contrast, for all (unshared) MƒÅori private dwellings that same year, 76.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 68.9 per cent a hot water service, 55.8 per cent a refrigerator, 54.1 per cent a flush toilet, and 47 per cent an electric washing machine.The Quest for security in New Zealand 1840 to 1966 by William Ball Sutch While the arrival of Europeans had a profound impact on the MƒÅori way of life, many aspects of traditional society have survived into the 21st century.

Although MƒÅori make up only 14 per cent of the population, they make up almost 50 per cent of the prison population. MƒÅori have higher unemployment rates than other cultures resident in New Zealand, which is believed to partially account for their over- representation in the criminal justice system; many young MƒÅori, finding themselves unemployed, are picked up for alcohol-related behaviours or small crimes such as vandalism.

MƒÅori as a whole can be considered as of New Zealand entirely (excepting the Chatham Islands, where the are Moriori); individual are recognised as for areas of New Zealand in which they are traditionally based (known in MƒÅori as ), while are within their . New Zealand law periodically requires consultation between the government and ‚Äîfor example, during major land development projects. This usually takes the form of negotiations between local or national government and the of one or more relevant , although the government generally decides which (if any) concerns are acted upon. New Zealand endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in April 2010. MƒÅori issues are a prominent feature of race relations in New Zealand. Historically, many PƒÅkehƒÅ viewed race relations in their country as being the \\"best in the world\\", a view that prevailed until MƒÅori urban migration in the mid-20th century brought cultural and socioeconomic differences to wider attention.King (1999), p. 468 MƒÅori protest movements grew significantly in the 1960s and 1970s seeking redress for past grievances, particularly in regard to land rights. Successive governments have responded by enacting affirmative action programmes, funding cultural rejuvenation initiatives and negotiating tribal settlements for past breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.Lashley (2006), pp 131‚Äì3 Further efforts have focused on reducing socioeconomic disparity. Nevertheless, race relations remains a contentious issue in New Zealand society. MƒÅori advocates continue to push for further redress claiming that their concerns are being marginalised or ignored. A 2007 Department of Corrections report found that MƒÅori are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system not only because they commit more crimes but also because they face prejudice at many levels: \\"a number of studies have shown evidence of greater likelihood, associated only with ethnicity, for MƒÅori offenders to have police contact, be charged, lack legal representation, not be granted bail, plead guilty, be convicted, be sentenced to non-monetary penalties, and be denied release to Home Detention\\". Conversely, critics denounce the scale of assistance given to MƒÅori as amounting to preferential treatment for a select group of people based on race. Both sentiments were highlighted during the foreshore and seabed controversy in 2004, in which the New Zealand government claimed sole ownership of the New Zealand foreshore and seabed, over the objections of MƒÅori groups who were seeking customary title.  Commerce  Wider commercial exposure has increased public awareness of the MƒÅori culture, but has also resulted in several legal disputes. Between 1998 and 2006, NgƒÅti Toa attempted to trademark the \\"\\" to prevent its use by commercial organisations without their permission. In 2001, Danish toymaker Lego faced legal action by several MƒÅori tribal groups opposed to them trademarking MƒÅori words used in the Bionicle product range.  Political representation  Greytown in 1897, with Richard Seddon in attendance Flag of MƒÅori proposed in 1998 MƒÅori have been involved in New Zealand politics since the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand, before the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840. MƒÅori have had reserved seats in the New Zealand Parliament since 1868: presently, this accounts for seven of the 120 seats in New Zealand's unicameral parliament. The contesting of these seats was the first opportunity for many MƒÅori to participate in New Zealand elections, although the elected MƒÅori representatives initially struggled to assert significant influence. MƒÅori received universal suffrage with other New Zealand citizens in 1893. Being a traditionally tribal people, no one organisation ostensibly speaks for all MƒÅori nationwide. The MƒÅori King Movement originated in the 1860s as an attempt by several to unify under one leader: in modern times, it serves a largely ceremonial role. Another attempt at political unity was the Kotahitanga Movement, which established a separate MƒÅori Parliament that held annual sessions from 1892 until its last sitting in 1902. There are seven designated MƒÅori seats in the New Zealand Parliament (and MƒÅori can and do stand in and win general roll seats), and consideration of and consultation with MƒÅori have become routine requirements for councils and government organisations. Debate occurs frequently as to the relevance and legitimacy of the MƒÅori electoral roll and seats. The National Party announced in 2008 it would abolish the seats when all historic Treaty settlements have been resolved, which it aimed to complete by 2014. However, after the election National reached an agreement with the MƒÅori Party not to abolish the seats until MƒÅori give their approval. Several MƒÅori political parties have formed over the years to improve the position of MƒÅori in New Zealand society. The present MƒÅori Party, formed in 2004, secured 1.32 per cent of the party vote at the 2014 general election and held two seats in the 51st New Zealand Parliament, with two MPs serving as Ministers outside Cabinet. The party did not achieve any representatives in the 52nd New Zealand Parliament.  Notes  *: MƒÅori has cognates in other Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian , Tahitian , and Cook Islands MƒÅori which all share similar meanings. *: The orthographic conventions developed by the MƒÅori Language Commission () recommend the use of the macron (ƒÅ ƒì ƒ´ ≈ç ≈´) to denote long vowels.

In Japan, it replaced the Auster/Stanza, and was exclusive to Nissan Prince Store locations. In North America, it was the entry level luxury sports sedan for the Infiniti brand. The word \\"primera\\" is Spanish for \\"first class\\" or \\"finest\\".  P10 (1990‚Äì1996) Since 1986, Nissan had been building Bluebirds ‚Äî essentially a rebadged home market Auster/Stanza ‚Äì for the market in European at its factory in Washington, Tyne and Wear, England. Nissan showcased the Primera X concept car at the 1989 Tokyo Motor Show, and concept car UV.X at the 1989 International Motor Show Germany. In September 1990, Nissan replaced the United Kingdom's Bluebird with the slightly smaller Primera. It had a conventional front wheel drive chassis and five speed manual gearbox, with some versions getting the option of a four speed automatic. Power came from 1.6 litre carbureted and 1.8 litre and 2.0 litre injection petrol engines; a 2.0 litre diesel followed from 1992 onwards, a 1.6 litre injection gasoline was introduced at the end of 1993. The 1.8 was originally a single point injection model (SR18Di); a multi point injection with more power was added in 1991. The 1.8 litre version was not sold in the rest of Europe. Bodystyles were four and five door saloons. A five door estate was also offered as the Primera Traveller, however, it received the slightly different sheet metal of the Nissan Avenir, and was only made in Japan. Nissan had targeted the car at the market in Europe. The Primera saw Nissan's multi link front suspension applied to front wheel drive for the first time. The 2.0 litre gasoline engine received a power upgrade in 1992, which gave the then ZXe (later renamed the eGT) 150 bhp from the standard 2.0 litre engine and a top speed of around 219 km/h (137 mph). Some five door British, RHD Primeras were exported back to Japan (as Primera UK GTs), Russia and Ireland. In the United States, cars built in Japan was rebadged as the Infiniti G20, part of Nissan's upper scale Infiniti brand. The G20 was based on the Japanese model Primera, which featured a narrower body to remain within the Japanese compact class tax bracket with width limit at . =Trim levels (in Europe)= The Primera range came in six trim levels at launch: L, LS, SLX, GS, GSX and ZX. The 1.6 litre engine was available in L, LS and LSX trim and the 2.0 litre engine was available in LS, GS and GSX trim. The ZX model had a 2.0 litre engine. From 1992 onwards, the range was facelifted and new L, LX, SLX, SGX and eGT trim levels replaced the original naming scheme. A 2.0 litre diesel version was available from 1992. The L cars were basic, and had 1.6 litre petrol engines only. The LX was slightly plusher, but 2.0 litre petrol and diesel versions were also available. SLX was the mid range model, and these also had a choice of 1.6 and 2.0 petrol, or 2.0 diesel engines. The SGX trim level was the luxury specification version; powered by the 2.0 litre engine. The eGT was the sporting version, with a 2.0 litre engine. Engine power was slightly increased during 1994, with the 1.6 model producing and the 2.0 model, . From 1994, the range received another facelift, and the trim levels were almost the same; although Equation replaced the basic L as the entry level trim; like its predecessor, it had a 1.6 petrol engine, but there was no diesel option. A rare AWD option was available, known as a T4, with . At this time, the SE replaced the SGX. A new \\"hot hatch\\" version, the SRi joined the line up from 1994, and this had a choice of 1.6 or 2.0 litre petrol engines. There was also a very rare version of the P10 built and tuned by Japanese tuning company Autech: These models came with special Autech suspension and interior packages and a tuned SR20DE 2.0 litre engine, making .

Unique in its class, new Primera featured multi link beam rear suspension with multi-link front suspension. Nissan Primera UK GT. The UK GT was the Sunderland built Primera hatchback exported to Japan as a captive import. As before, in Europe the Primera was sold with 1.6 L and 2.0 L petrol engines and a 2.0 L diesel, with hatchback, saloon and estate bodystyles. While the estate was now based on the Primera's platform, it was assigned a model code of WP11. In Japan, the Primera was initially offered with the SR18DE, SR20DE and SR20VE for engines only in Japan, and initially only as a sedan; these models were slightly narrower at to remain within the Japanese compact class tax bracket, and was Nissan's car for the Supertouring era of Japanese Touring Car Championship, although it failed to recapture the title or Skyline GT-R's dominant glory of the Group A era. The hatchback assembled in the United Kingdom was available only with the SR20DE engine and automatic transmission and began production from November 1997, a captive import known as the Primera UK GT. Estate began production from September 1997. Nissan Primera Camino in Japan Alongside the original Primera, the Nissan Primera Camino was launched as a badge engineered model for different dealer networks. The models for Japan also introduced a CVT automatic transmission during the P11 series, including a six speed tiptronic version in the M6 G.V and Autech edition wagons and Te.V saloon. Nissan Primera HP11 TE.V was equipped with SR20VE and CVT M6 transmissions only. Nissan continued selling the Primera in the United States as the Infiniti G20 until 2002, when it was replaced by a rebadged version of the Nissan Skyline V35 as the Infiniti G35. The G20 used the same grille and rear lamp alterations from the Primera Camino. 1998 P11 SMX Primera NZDM In 1998, Nissan New Zealand released a limited edition Primera SMX with association with Steve Millen (Stillen Sports Parts). Features include cross drilled brakes, Eibach springs and a more aggressive body kit. There were a total of 26 (including the prototype numbered 000) made in five colour choices (the prototype was the only white one made). This was because until 1998 (due to lifting of import tariffs on cars) Nissan had an automotive assembly operation in New Zealand, and for a short time between 1997 and 1998 the P11 Primera was assembled in Wiri, Auckland. 1999 BTCC Winning Primera The Primera won the British Touring Car Championship manufacturer's and team titles thanks to RML in 1998 and, in 1999 British Touring Car (P.O.S) backing from the factory took the Independents' Cup in 1999 and 2000. To celebrate the two victories in 1998, Nissan UK released a limited edition of 400 'GTSE' models, with 16\\" AZEV alloy wheels, two tone 'flip' ChromaFlair \\"Mystic\\" green paint, following the special theme to the interior which featured full leather seating with green piping seats, steering wheel and a Momo gearknob. To celebrate the 1999 \\"clean sweep\\", they released a limited edition GTLE model with 16\\" multi spoke Enkei alloy wheels, a full leather interior with silver piping, a Momo gearknob and a colour choice of flame red, kuro black, starburst silver, and Nordic blue. Nissan Primera Traveller in Europe =Facelift= In the end of 1999, Nissan gave the Primera a facelift, giving it a more modern front end with clear style headlamps featuring projector units, instead of the traditional Fresnel lens type. Nissan also introduced their \\"corporate identity\\" front, with the \\"flying wing\\" grille. The new code name for this model was \\"P11-144\\". Along with the exterior changes, improved specification levels were present; with the entry level models such as the \\"S\\" featuring automatic climate control, driver, passenger, and side airbags. Further up the model range, other features were seen such as xenon headlamps. A new \\"lean burn\\" 1.8 L petrol engine, the QG18DE was added to the range. This facelift was not generally applied outside Europe and was not available in Japan when Nissan \\"formalized\\" the fronts of other Primeras and Caminos instead, bringing them into line with the look of the American model of Infiniti. Production ended in June 2002. File:Nissan Primera P10 in Aardenburg.JPGNissan Primera sedan facelift (Europe) File:Nissan Primera P11 hatchback facelift.jpgNissan Primera hatchback facelift (Europe) =STCC Edition= The Primera STCC Edition (named for the Swedish Touring Car Championship) is a limited production model based on the Primera Sport. One hundred examples were made. It had the same engine as the Primera Sport, but it was lowered , had headlight \\"goggles\\" and had a bigger wing.  P12 (2001‚Äì2007) Nissan introduced the third generation Nissan Primera on January 30, 2001, its first all new car since the alliance with Renault was formed two years earlier. The new Primera was more radically styled than previous versions. No Infiniti equivalent was released; the Nissan Skyline based Infiniti G35 replaced the G20 in the United States. New Zealand Primeras were introduced in 2002, and were all equipped with continuously variable transmissions; there was no manual option. In that market, sedans and wagons built in Japan were available. This remained true until 2006, when hatchbacks and estates assembled in the United Kingdom were made available. The CVT is also available in the European 2.0 L and the Japanese 2.0/2.5 L (an engine not available in Europe). Falling sales caused the Primera to be withdrawn from sale in the United Kingdom in November 2006. However, LHD production ceased during 2007. In Japan, production of RHD Primeras also continued until 2007. In 2011, a large number of brand new Primeras appeared in the market in Ireland, after apparently having been in storage since 2006. The 2.0 L six speed manual Nissan Primera 20V has Nissan's SR20VE Neo VVL engine with variable valve lift and timing. It produces 150 kW (204 PS) of power at 7,200 rpm and 206 N¬∑m (21.0 kgf¬∑m) of torque at 5,200 rpm. =Replacement= Speculation in the motoring press suggested that a \\"tweaked\\" version of the Nissan Altima would be the replacement, but this did not happen. In August 2006, Auto Express reported pictures of a disguised, Sentra based prototype testing in Germany. However, it was actually the new Nissan Sentra, which was built in Spain rather than at Sunderland for European buyers. Such was the success of the Qashqai in Europe, that Nissan did not launch a direct replacement for the Primera, despite earlier plans for such a model to be developed for at least some markets in Europe.

Zhonghua minzu was established during the early Republican (1912‚Äì1927) and Nationalist (1928‚Äì1949) periods to include Han Chinese people and four major non-Han ethnic groups: the Man (Manchus), the Meng (Mongols), the Hui (ethnic groups of Islamic faith in Northwest China), and the Zang (Tibetans), under the notion of a republic of five races ( or W«îz√∫ g√≤ngh√©) advocated by Sun Yat Sen and the Chinese Nationalist Party. Zhonghua minzu was initially rejected in the People's Republic of China (PRC) but resurrected after Mao Zedong's death to include the mainstream Han Chinese and 55 other ethnic groups as a huge Chinese family. Since the late 1980s, the most fundamental change of the PRC's nationalities and minorities policies is the renaming from \\"the Chinese People\\" ( or Zh≈çnggu√≥ r√©nm√≠n) to \\"the Chinese Nation\\" (Zh≈çnghu√° m√≠nz√∫), signalling a shift away from a multi-national communist people's statehood of China to one multi-ethnic Chinese nation state with one single Chinese national identity. With this the Chinese state shifts its claim of representation of people through citizenship, to representing a wider nation with anyone of one of the Chinese ethnicities as nationals, even if they are legally nationals of other states, such as Taiwan or Singapore. This has caused confusion with calling people Chinese nationals which is the term in international law to refer to the Chinese citizens and not any people who are included in the national identity applied by the Chinese state. Woman wearing a cheongsam or qipao, a typical ethnic fusion dress of Manchu origin absorbing Han and Mongol styles.  History  An older similar term would be Huaxia, but the immediate roots of the Zhonghua minzu lie in the Qing dynasty founded by the Manchu clan Aisin Gioro in what is today Northeast China.

The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state, including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas as \\"China\\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \\"China\\", using \\"China\\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \\"Chinese language\\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \\"Chinese people\\" (‰∏≠Âúã‰πã‰∫∫ Zhongguo zhi ren; Dulimbai gurun-i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing.Zhao 2006, pp. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.

Before the rise of nationalism people were generally loyal to the city-state, the feudal fief and its lord or, in the case of China, to the dynastic state. The French Revolution and subsequent developments in Europe paved the way for the modern nation-state and nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history. Nationalism spread in the early 19th century to central Europe and from there to eastern and southeastern Europe and in the early 20th century nationalism began to appear in China. While Qing rulers adopted the Han Chinese imperial model and considered their state as Zhongguo (\\"‰∏≠Âúã\\", the term for \\"China\\" in modern Chinese), and the name \\"China\\" was commonly used in international communications and treaties (such as the Treaty of Nanking), domestically however, some Chinese nationalists such as Sun Yat-sen initially described the Manchus as \\"foreign invaders\\" to be expelled, and planned to establish a Han nation-state modelled closely after Germany and Japan. Fearing, however, that this restrictive view of the ethnic nation-state would result in the loss of large parts of imperial territory, Chinese nationalists discarded this concept. The abdication of the Qing emperor inevitably led to controversy about the status of territories in Tibet and Mongolia. While the emperor formally bequeathed all the Qing territories to the new republic, it was the position of Mongols and Tibetans that their allegiance had been to the Qing monarch; with the abdication of the Qing, they owed no allegiance to the new Chinese state. This was rejected by the Republic of China and subsequently the People's Republic of China. Liang Qichao, who put forward the concept of \\"Zhonghua Minzu (the Chinese nation)\\" This development in Chinese thinking was mirrored in the expansion of the meaning of the term Zhonghua minzu. Originally coined by the late Qing philologist Liang Qichao, Zhonghua minzu initially referred only to the Han Chinese. It was then expanded to include the Five Races Under One Union, based on the ethnic categories of the Qing. Sun Yatsen further expanded this concept when he wrote, The concept of Zhonghua minzu was first publicly espoused by President Yuan Shikai in 1912, shortly after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China. Facing the imminent independence of Outer Mongolia from China, Yuan Shikai stated, \\"Outer Mongolia is part of Zhonghua minzu [the Chinese nation] and has been of one family for centuries\\" (). After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the concept of Zhonghua minzu became influenced by Soviet nationalities policy. Officially, the PRC is a unitary state composed of 56 ethnic groups, of which the Han ethnic group is by far the largest. The concept of Zhonghua minzu is seen as an all- encompassing category consisting of people within the borders of the PRC. This term has continued to be invoked and remains a powerful concept in China into the 21st century. In mainland China, it continues to hold use as the leaders of China need to unify into one political entity a highly diverse set of ethnic and social groups as well as to mobilize the support of overseas Chinese in developing China. In Taiwan it has been invoked by President Ma as a unifying concept that includes the people of both Taiwan and mainland China without a possible interpretation that Taiwan is part the People's Republic of China, whereas terms such as \\"Chinese people\\" can be, given that the PRC is commonly known as \\"China\\". Implications The adoption of the Zhonghua minzu concept may give rise to the reinterpretation of Chinese history. For example, the Manchu-founded Qing Dynasty was originally sometimes characterized as a \\"conquering regime\\" or a \\"non-Han\\" regime. Following the adoption of the Zhonghua minzu ideology, which regards the Manchus as a member of the Zhonghua minzu, dynasties founded by ethnic minorities are no longer stigmatized. The concept of Zhonghua minzu nevertheless also leads to the reassessment of the role of many traditional hero figures. Heroes such as Yue Fei and Koxinga, who were originally often considered to have fought for China against barbarian incursions, have been recharacterized by some as minzu yingxiong (ethnic heroes) who fought not against barbarians but against other members of the Zhonghua minzu (the Jurchens and Manchus respectively). At the same time, China exemplified heroes such as Genghis Khan, who became a \\"national hero\\" as a member of the Zhonghua minzu. The Zhonghua Minzu concept in practice gives Chinese nationals who are not of the ethnic Han majority preferential university entry status, favorable tax laws, non-compliance with the one-child policy, among other preferential conditions under Chinese law for ethnic minorities. Ambiguity The theory behind the ideology of Zhonghua minzu is that it includes not only the Han but also other minority ethnic groups within China, such as the Mongols, Manchus, Hmong, Tibetans, Tuvans, etc. An ethnic Korean from China living and working in Korea or an ethnic Mongol from China living and working in the Mongolia would both be considered members of the Zhonghua Minzu, which can give rise to potential issues (including contemporary loyalty to contemporary states, the proper boundary lines between states/subnational entities, and the modern categorization of historical states) of identity. Whether ethnic Han Chinese living overseas and not having Chinese citizenship are considered part of this Chinese nationality depends on the speaker and the context. More often than not, overseas Chinese in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore make a clear distinction between being Chinese in a political sense and being Chinese in an ethnic sense, making it unclear whether or not they belong to such a group that contains both political and ethnic connotations. The conceptual boundaries of the Zhonghua minzu may be complicated by the politics of neighboring countries such as Mongolia and Korea, who exclusively claim regional historical peoples and states. For instance, the idea of Genghis Khan as a \\"national hero\\" is contested by Mongolia, which since the fall of socialism has explicitly positioned Genghis Khan as the father of the Mongolian state. In opposition to this, it is common to point out that there are more ethnic Mongolians in China than in the state of Mongolia. In further argument, Mongolians are a large minority in the Russian Federation and some traditionally Mongol lands have never been ruled by Han Chinese. A dispute of a similar nature has arisen over the status of the state of Goguryeo in ancient history, with China claiming it as Chinese on the grounds that much of it existed within the current borders of China as well as the ancient borders of China. On that basis Chinese nationalists maintain that these territories belong to the heterogeneous origin of the Chinese nation. This view is generally rejected by historians from South Korea and North Korea, as well as experts on Goguryeo history from various countries such as the United States, Russia, Mongolia, and Australia. It has also received criticism from certain domestic scholars, such as Song Chengyou, professor of history at Peking University, who likewise considered Goguryeo as a part of Korean history and denied Chinese connections.

From 2009 to 2019, he was the chief executive officer (CEO) of the British-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever. In 2019, he created a new organization called Imagine, along with co-founders Valerie Keller and Jeff Seabright, to help businesses \\"eradicate poverty and inequality and stem runaway climate change.\\" Early life and education Polman was born and grew up in the Dutch city of Enschede, in a Catholic family with three brothers and two sisters, the son of a tyre company executive father and a former schoolteacher mother. Polman had hoped to become a doctor, but medical school places were allocated by lottery and he was not chosen. Instead, he studied at the University of Groningen, graduating with a BBA/BA in 1977. He completed his MA in Economics and MBA in Finance and International Marketing in 1979 at University of Cincinnati. In June 2014 Polman received his honorary doctorate during the 400th anniversary of the University of Groningen. On May 18, 2018, Polman received his Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from George Mason University. As the day's Commencement speaker, Dr. Polman declared, \\"Any system where too many feel they are not participating or are left behind will ultimately rebel against itself.\\" Capturing the spirit of his own sense of purpose, he continued, \\"The world we want will only be achieved when we choose action over indifference, courage over comfort, and solidarity over division.\\" Career =Procter & Gamble= Polman worked for Procter & Gamble for 27 years, starting in 1979 as a cost analyst, becoming managing director of P&G; U.K. from 1995 to 1998, president of global fabric care from 1998 to 2001, and group president for Europe in 2001. =Nestl√©= Polman then joined Nestl√© in 2006 as chief financial officer and head of the Americas. =Unilever= On 1 January 2009, Polman succeeded Patrick Cescau as chief executive officer of Unilever. Under Polman's leadership, Unilever has set a target to decouple its growth from its overall environmental footprint and improve its social impact through the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan. Polman has argued that, in a volatile world of finite resources, running a business sustainably is vital for its long-term growth and also mitigates risk and reduces costs. Unilever has now seen eight years of top line growth, averaging twice the rate of overall market growth, whilst improving the bottom line and delivering a total shareholder return of 290%. Bernstein's 2017 Blackbook entitled 'European Food and HPC: 10-Year Global Market Share Analysis' rated Unilever top-of-class for absolute market share gains (ex-M&A;) and a proportion of its categories with gains. It also compared medium-term operating expectations to current valuations, leading to an Outperform rating on Unilever. Some shareholders, however, have worried that Polman's focus on sustainability has become more important to him than the financial performance of Unilever after the company missed sales targets for six out of eight quarters in 2013 and 2014. Polman, who scrapped short- term targets at the company, has argued that the failure to meet targets is a result of erratic currency fluctuations and the slow-down in emerging markets since 2013. Paul Polman has said that he has ambitions to increase the company's sales in emerging markets from the current 57% (47% in 2008) to 70% of turnover.

Yi Tai Study Hall used to house two gods by a society organized by 16 renowned members of the local scholar-gentry. It has been used as a venue for educating youths of the villages. The forecourt of Yi Tai Study Hall was paved with white stones, so students who attended the study hall were also known as the \\"Students of White Stone Lane\\". White Stone Lane located outside the main entrance. Yi Tai Study Hall was built in a simple but functional style without great ornamental features. It was mainly decorated by leafy and geometric plaster moldings. Cheung Chun Yuen, one of the Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong, used to teach the youths about martial arts. Also, it was the only place that taught martial arts in the Kam Tin area in the past. The traditional Chinese education system was imperial examination. Youngsters can attend the examination in order to become Juren. That was the honor to students that passed the imperial examination and serve the Emperor. Successful students can enjoy high social status and gain reputation for themselves. Thus, their family's social position and power can be enhanced. It had become a great concern to the clan that to gain official positions in the government. The Chou Wong Yi Kung Study Hall is a Grade III historic building. It was erected in 1685 by the Tang Clan, in honour of Chou Yu-te and Wang Lai- jen, two imperial officials whose pleading with the Emperor ended the coastal evacuation, and enabled the inhabitants to return to their homes in 1669.The incredible journey of Yuen Long - Chau Wong Yi Kung Study Hall Transportation Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) * 54 Yuen Long (West) Bus Terminus - Sheung Tsuen (Circular) * 64K Yuen Long (West) Bus Terminus - Tai Po Market Railway Station * 77K Yuen Long (Fung Cheung Road) Bus Terminus - Sheung Shui Bus Terminus * 251B Pat Heung Road Bus Terminus - Sheung Tsuen (Circular) Green Minibus (GMB) * 601 Yuen Long (Fung Cheung Road) - Pak Wai Tsuen MTR * Kam Sheung Road References  Further reading  * (about Shui Mei Tsuen and Shui Tau Tsuen) External links * Delineation of area of existing village Shui Tau Tsuen (Kam Tin) for election of resident representative (2019 to 2022) * Antiquities and Monuments Office.

He was one of the most recognisable scientific figures in Scotland due to his many appearances on TV and radio. His large academic output and contributions to the understanding of the flora and fauna in Scotland and elsewhere have been internationally recognised. Dr Watson was widely acknowledged as Scotland's pre-eminent authority on the Cairngorms mountain range.  Early and personal life  Adam Watson was born on 14 April 1930 at Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. In March 1955 he married Jenny Raitt, with whom he had two children, Jenny and Adam Christopher.  Academic achievements  From an early age, Watson showed considerable academic prowess. He was Dux of Turriff Primary School (1942) and of Turriff Senior Secondary School (1948) in Latin, English, Higher Latin, English, French, Science, lower History and Mathematics. At Aberdeen University, in 1952 Watson gained 1st class honours in Pure Science (Zoology) and also won the MacGillivray Prize, Department of Natural History. In 1956, he got a PhD for his thesis on the \\"Annual Cycle of Rock Ptarmigan\\", a bird that has fascinated Watson all of his adult life. In 1967, he added a 2nd Doctorate (DSc) for scientific papers on populations and behaviour of northern animals. Watson was inspired by the writings of Seton Gordon, whose book The Cairngorm Hills of Scotland Watson came across as a child, and was 'transformed' by its content. This sparked his lifelong interest in the Cairngorms, and Watson remained in contact with Gordon until his death in 1977.  Published work and editorships  The body of work by Watson over 58 years (1944‚Äì2012) includes 23 books, 287 peer-reviewed scientific papers, 178 technical reports, 40 book reviews, and many articles in newspapers and magazines. His editorships include: * 1956‚Äì64 Editor, The Scottish Naturalist * 1969 Editorial Board, Journal of Animal Ecology * 1970 Editor, British Ecological Society's 10th Symposium Volume, Animal Populations in relation to their Food Resources, Blackwell Scientific Publications * 1981‚Äì89 Editorial Board, Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment = The Place Names of Upper Deeside = The Place Names of Upper Deeside is a 1984 toponymic book by Watson and Elizabeth Allan about the Gaelic place names in the upper part of western Aberdeenshire known as Deeside. Watson started his research in 1971 and collected over the next 13 years more than 7,000 place-names largely based on interviews with 260 local people. Interviewees included the last surviving native speaker of Deeside Gaelic, Jean Bain in Crathie, Aberdeenshire. A contemporary review said about the book: \\"There have been many place name studies published in Scotland during the course of the present century but none can match in detail and usefulness The Place Names of Upper Deeside by Adam Watson and Elizabeth Allan.\\" Professor of Celtic at the University of Glasgow Derick Thomson described the book's detail and breadth in The Year's Work in Modern Language Studies. A review in The Scots Magazine called it \\"a remarkable gazetteer of the topography running to 220 large pages in a beautifully-presented work\\". The Scotsman upon Watson's death in 2019, called the book \\"magisterial\\". Watson continued his toponymic studies later in life, and published Place Names in Much of North-East Scotland about place names in Angus and Kincardineshire in 2013, and, with Ian Murray, the book Upper Deeside and the far Highlands in 2015.

The municipality covers an area of 6.7 km¬≤, and it is part of the Centro District in the Valles Centrales region. Its climate is warm most of the time, and the municipal area has a diversity of both animal and plant species. As of 2005, the municipality had a total population of 3189, the majority of them being Catholic. Approximately 69 people speak an indigenous language, according to the 2005 INEGI census. The origin of the name \\"Animas Trujano\\" dates to the times of the Mexican War of Independence. Originally, the municipality was just called \\"Animas\\", but people decided to add the word \\"Trujano\\" in honor to Valerio Trujano. He spent a little time in Animas, but then he was executed by the Spanish royalist army during the Mexican War of Independence. One of the attractions of Animas Trujano is the \\"Danza de la Pluma\\". People also celebrate the feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe on December 12, a festival in honor of the Virgin of Rosario, the Holy Week and more. History This town, along with three other suburbs nearby (Santa Mar√≠a, la Raya and San Bartolo el peque√±o), were initially part of a larger municipality called San Bartolo Coyotepec. However, over time, Animas and those three communities separated and eventually became independent. At first, Animas was only inhabited by two or three families who were sent there by San Bartolo in order to work the land. During that time, the owner of an adjacent farm called \\"Hacienda del Carmen\\" divided it and gave each of his workers a portion. Because this farm was close to Animas, it and its inhabitants later became a part of it. When Animas' name was changed to \\"Animas Trujano\\", the town was not yet a municipality. It became on February 17, 1868, after the Mexican War of Independence, that it was officially recognized as a municipality. Culture Animas Trujano has one of the oldest Nineteenth- century churches of Oaxaca, which is recognized as a historical monument. Also, although it is not a big city, it has its own musical band, which plays various songs from different eras. The band is characterized by the fact that its members use wind instruments to produce their music. Besides the variety of celebrations, the municipality provides many kinds of dishes, such as \\"mole negro,\\" \\"empanadas\\" and \\"tlayudas con asiento\\". Chocolate, \\"champurrado\\" and \\"atole de granillo\\" make up the typical beverages of this region.

It is 1760 meters above the sea level. Its territory is delimited by other small municipalities. At the north it is limited by Santiago Miltepec and San Juan Bautista Suchitepec municipalities; in south by Santa Maria Camotlan; at the east by Santa Catarina Zapoquila and Santiago Thuitlan Plumas; finally at the west it is delimited by Ciudad de Huajuapan de leon and Santiago Miltepec. History There is no reliable history on where the original settlers of this area came from. According to the National Archive, a royal grant was issued to Martin Enriquez Visorrey in 1578 to establish the Spanish settlement. In 1704, this land was given to an indigenous chieftain. In 1785, the lands passed into the hands of Gregorio Villagomez. Finally, because of a viceregal decision, the lands were given to the family of Mariano Francisco which settled here and founded the modern town. During the Spanish domination and even after Mexican Independence, the chieftains and their descendants had power over all the inhabitants of the town. After some years of being exploited by the chieftains the inhabitants fought for their rights, obtaining a kind of agreement in which they established that the inhabitants could own and use the lands for their own benefit by only paying a very small amount of money. As a consequence a great majority of the inhabitants owned most of the town, ending the conflicts between the chieftains and the inhabitants of the town. Economic activities 60 per cent of the people in this area work in agricultural fields. The principal crops produced are beans, chili peppers, and amaranth. Another 30 per cent of the population works with handling livestock, the main livestock being pigs, cattle, and goats. The remaining 10 per cent works in local trades.  Cultural And Tourist Attractions  This Oaxacan Municipality does not have great historic monuments, but it does have a small archeological area. Approximately 1 kilometer from the east part of the town, it is located in the Cerro Del Mosquito, an uninhabited area in which there has been found many prehistoric artifacts such as pottery, carved stones, and jade. It has a large scale festival every year on August 14 through to August 16known as the Fiesta Patronal. These events are organized by inhabitants of the town with regard to their religious idol. In this case the festivity is with regard to \\"Santa Maria Asuncion‚Äù. Usually this kind of events involved a great variety of activities such as sports, folkloric dances, and fireworks. Every neighborhood of the town has its own religious idol, so when is time to prepare the festivity, a different person is chosen every year to organize the event. In Mexico, on November 2 it is a tradition to celebrate the Day of the Dead, known as \\"Dia de los Muertos\\" in which every family honors their dead relatives. In Cacalotepec every family visits their relatives graves and then prepare an ofrenda in which they offer to their loved ones a variety of traditional foods such as mole, tamales, mescal, chocolate, and bread, according to what the dead ancestor enjoyed while they were living.

After this event, the new Nochixtl√°n was founded in 1527 by Francisco Orozco, who was assisted by fifty Mixtecs who survived these diseases. All of them were intellectuals, who also did commerce activity. For this reason the town became known as \\"the traders' town\\". There is a myth that in 997 Quetzalc√≥atl, arrived to the municipality. He was a Mixtec God who disseminates the culture, science and art in this region. In 1997 was the 1,000 anniversary of this event. That is why people expect something to happen. On the same year (1997) Mexico achieved 75 years of public education. Its promoter was Nochixtl√°n Abraham's son. Nochixtl√°n Abraham Castellanos Coronado, who was a professor, writer, and philosopher, helped to develop the cultural values of this culture.

There,a Spanish force threatened general Vicente Guerrero who was in Ahuajutla's ranch helping his troops by using the metals from the mines of carbonera to coin money (from gold, copper and silver). He stayed and waited until the perfect opportunity arrived to attack the Spaniards in Azompa, taking advantage of darkness and letting them to destroy themselves. The next morning when they realized what had happened, they were shocked so the general Vicente Guerrero attacked them again and achieved victory, taking some prisoners with him to Xonacatlan camp where he had some other forces.

It hosts one of the most significant public art collections in the South of England and draws over 100,000 visitors a year. It was described by ITV News as \\"the region's biggest art gallery\\", in 2017. It was established with a bequest in 1920, from John Chisholm Towner who had served as a local alderman. It was first homed in Manor Gardens, adjacent to Gildredge Park in the Old Town area of Eastbourne. Opening there in 1923, it closed when the building was sold in 2005. In 2009, it re-opened in a purpose-built facility adjacent to the Congress Theatre, near Eastbourne's seafront. History The Towner Gallery was established as a project in 1920 following the death that year of Alderman John Chisholm Towner, who left 22 paintings, ¬£6,000 and instructions for the establishment of an art gallery. This bequest was made for the benefit of the people of Eastbourne; the undertaking was entrusted to a local group of supporters and the local council. =1923 opening= The gallery was originally based in The Manor House. For 72 years, the Gallery was located within a Manor House on the High Street in the Old Town area. The Manor House, located within its own Manor Gardens, dated to the 18th Century, but was taken over in the 1920s for public use as a public gallery and local museum, following Towner's bequest. A noted historic building in Eastbourne, the Manor House is dwarfed in age by its neighbours; being opposite the Lamb Inn, dating back to 1180AD and St Mary's Church, from the same period. Despite having been owned by the town as a public facility for most of the 20th Century, the Manor House and gardens were sold in 2005/6 by the local authority, Eastbourne Borough Council.http://www.gildredgemanor.co.uk/aboutgildredgemanor.aspx =2005-9: no gallery or museum= In 2009, after a gap of several years during which Eastbourne had no local art gallery or museum, Towner reopened in a purpose- built gallery building adjacent to the Congress Theatre. Funders of the new gallery included the Heritage Lottery Fund and Eastbourne Borough Council. =2009: new building= The current building in which the gallery is located is joined onto the Congress Theatre Designed by Rick Mather Architects and built mainly from concrete, at a cost of ¬£8.6m, the new gallery building was planned to be more easily accessible to the public and to store the 4,000 works of the growing collection in a safe and climate-controlled manner. Visually, it was designed to reflect the chalk cliffs of the Eastbourne Downs. Unlike the old building, no provision was made to incorporate a local museum, though substantially more space was created for a caf√©, shop and larger exhibitions. =2014: transfer of ownership from Eastbourne Borough Council= In 2014, Eastbourne Borough Council transferred operation of the Gallery to a newly-created independent charitable trust. David Dimbleby was appointed the Chair of Trustees. The Council retained ownership of the Gallery's building and its collection of artworks. =2017: threats of closure= Despite no longer directly operating the Gallery, Eastbourne Borough Council remained a major annual funder, alongside the UK's Arts Council. In 2017, cuts in the local authority's funding of 50% were proposed. This threatens the gallery with closure to some or all of its services and the greater use of admission charges for access to public art. Collections and exhibitions =Towner Collection= The Towner Collection is one of the most significant public art collections in the South East of England. It boasts in excess of 5,000 works of art by historic, modern and contemporary artists including: Lawrence Alma- Tadema, John Gascoigne Lake, Vanessa Bell, David Bomberg, Alan Davie, Tacita Dean, Olafur Eliasson, Anya Gallaccio, Thomas Jones, Peter Liversidge, Henry Moore, William Nicholson, Julian Opie, Ian Potts, Victor Pasmore, Pablo Picasso, Eric Ravilious, Eric Slater, Wolfgang Tillmans, Alfred Wallis, Christopher Wood, Joseph Wright of Derby and Carol Wyatt. The initial collection consisted mainly of Victorian narrative painting, especially pictures of animals and children. The current collection now includes oil paintings, watercolours, works on paper, etchings, prints, sculpture, wood cuts, ceramic objects, installations and video art. Since the gallery was established it has received donations of work by significant artists including: Walter Sickert, Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore, Victor Pasmore, Alfred Wallis, Frances Hodgkins, Phelan Gibb and David Bomberg. By 1962 the Observer said it was \\"the most go-ahead municipal gallery of its size in the country\\". This was mainly because of the purchase of a group of works by modern abstract artists of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1962, the Rector of Berwick Church gave over 35 studies and sketches for the Berwick Church murals. As a result of the first curator's ‚ÄòPictures of Sussex‚Äô policy the Towner Collection gradually increased. Pictures were acquired of subjects relating to Sussex. This scheme was later extended to allow inclusion of pictures executed by Sussex artists regardless of subject matter. Village Street by Eric Ravilious (1936) is in the gallery's collection A key element of the collection is the work of Eric Ravilious, who studied and taught at Eastbourne School of Art. In 1982, the family of the artist deposited on loan an important body of his work. The Towner holds the broadest collection of paintings, illustrations and commercial designs in the world, by this important modern British artist of the early 20th century. =South East Arts Collection of Contemporary Art= As a result of an agreement made in 1983, the Towner houses the South East Arts Collection of Contemporary Art. Further bequests in 1988 and 1990 considerably enhanced the collection, and the commitment to purchasing contemporary art was recognised nationally. =Exhibitions= The Towner Art Gallery's first curator started the practice of arranging temporary exhibitions to be shown alongside displays from the permanent collection which have become a major feature of the Towner's programme. Learning and community programmes The Towner Art Gallery works as an educational arts centre, delivering programmes to thousands of people of all ages. In the process, it works with schools, colleges, libraries, museums, health care providers, youth services, universities and community groups. =Annual Schools Exhibition= The Gallery's Annual Schools Exhibition is one of the largest regular displays of artwork by children at schools in the United Kingdom. =Eastbourne Sunshine Carnival= The Gallery participates in the annual local carnival, running workshops to create artwork with local schools for public display and celebration. =Arts Award= The Gallery offers support for the national Arts Award programme of qualifications, for ages 5 to 25. It has been given 'Good Practice' status by Trinity College, London and Arts Council England, \\"in recognition of the depth and breadth of creative practice.\\" =Fuse Box= The Gallery has a learning room called Fuse Box, which offers a changing interactive environment designed alongside the temporary exhibitions in the main gallery space. =The Sussex Open= The Gallery holds an annual public competition, accepting submissions from artists in the region, for exhibition and acceptance into the permanent collection. Artists who have previously been first exhibited in this exhibition, have gone on to be selected for John Moore's Painting Prize, the Jerwood Drawing Prize, the BFI Film Festival in the experimental film category and have been shortlisted for the Mark Tanner Sculpture Prize. In 2017, the catchment area was expanded to include artists based in West Sussex, as well as East Sussex where the Gallery is based. Categories for submission cover a range of media: painting, photography, drawing, film, ceramics and sculpture.

They built with palm and wood on a high piece of land surrounded by vegetation. While living in this region, the first settlers were surprised by the discovery of dens of mouse-like animals known as tuza, because of this discovery the settlers decided to name the place \\"El Tuzal\\". Over time more settlers like the Zacar√≠as brothers and Juvencio Fuentes arrived in the region. That was how life in the region developed until 1905 when General Porfirio D√≠az, president of Mexico, developed the infrastructure of the region and its official district Tepantepec. This project drastically changed life in El Tuzal since many people working on the new infrastructure decided to settle there too. The region grew because the villagers obtained good crops in both the rainy season and in the dry season. That is why the name of the region was changed to Chahuites, which means wet ground. As the region continued its development, the settlers began the process required to become an independent municipality instead of being part of Tepantepec. In 1948 the Chahuites finally became independent.

Most propaganda is based on the Juche ideology and on the promotion of the Workers' Party of Korea. The first syllable, \\"ju\\", means the man; the second syllable, \\"che\\", means body of oneself.Article 3 of the Socialist Constitution proclaims, \\"The DPRK is guided in its activities by the Juche idea, a world outlook centered on people, a revolutionary ideology for achieving the independence of the masses of people.\\" Many pictures of the national leaders are posted throughout the country. Themes =Cult of personality= Kim Il-sung with Kim Jong-il on Mount Paektu North Korean propaganda was crucial to the formation and promotion of the cult of personality centered around the founder of the DPRK, Kim Il-sung. The Soviet Union used propaganda to develop a cult of personality around Kim, particularly as a resistance fighter, as soon as they put him in power. This quickly surpassed its Eastern European models. Instead of depicting his actual residence in a Soviet village during the war with the Japanese, he was claimed to have fought a guerrilla war from a secret base. Once relations with the Soviet Union were broken off, their role was expurgated, as were all other nationalists, until the claim was made that Kim founded the Communist Party in North Korea. He is seldom shown in action during the Korean War, instead, soldiers are depicted as inspired by him. Subsequently, many stories are recounted of his \\"on-the-spot guidance\\" in various locations, many of them being openly presented as fictional. This was supplemented with propaganda on behalf of his son, Kim Jong-il.\\" The North Korean famine of the 90's, referred to as a \\"food shortage\\" by DPRK propaganda, produced anecdotes of Kim insisting on eating the same meager food as other North Koreans. Propaganda efforts began for the \\"Young General\\", Kim Jong-un, who succeeded him as the paramount leader of North Korea on Kim Jong- il's death in December 2011. =Foreign relations= Paintings on the walls of the Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities depict alleged atrocities carried out by American soldiers during the Korean War. Early propaganda, in the 1940s, presented a positive Soviet‚ÄìKorean relationship, often depicting Russians as maternal figures to childlike Koreans. As soon as relations were less cordial, they were expurgated from historical accounts. The collapse of the USSR, without a shot, is often depicted with intense contempt in sources not accessible to Russians. Americans are depicted particularly negatively. They are presented as an inherently evil race, with whom hostility is the only possible relationship. The Korean War is used as a source for atrocities, less for the bombing raids than on charges of massacre. June 25 is considered the start of \\"Struggle Against US Imperialism Month\\" (informally called \\"Hate America Month\\" in the U.S. media), which is commemorated by anti-U.S. mass rallies at Kim Il-sung Square, Pyongyang. In 2018, these rallies were cancelled in what the Associated Press called \\"another sign of detente following the summit between leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump\\". Japan is frequently depicted as rapacious and dangerous, both in the colonial era and afterward. North Korean propaganda frequently highlighted the danger of Japanese remilitarization. At the same time, the intensity of anti- Japanese propaganda underwent repeated fluctuations, depending on the improvement or deterioration of Japanese-DPRK relations. In those periods when North Korea was on better terms with Japan than with South Korea, North Korean propaganda essentially ignored the Liancourt Rocks dispute. However, if Pyongyang felt threatened by Japanese-South Korean rapprochement or sought to cooperate with Seoul against Tokyo, the North Korean media promptly raised the issue, with the aim of causing friction in Japanese-ROK relations. Friendly nations are depicted almost exclusively as tributary nations. The English journalist Christopher Hitchens pointed out in the essay A Nation of Racist Dwarfs that propaganda has a blatantly racist and nationalistic angle: South Korea A North Korean propaganda poster-wall promoting Korean reunification in the near-future, declaring, \\"Let Us Pass Down A United Country To The Next Generation!\\". This is located in the North Korean side of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). South Korea was originally depicted as a poverty-stricken land which was run by harsh and cruel dictators backed by the US and where American soldiers based there shot and slaughtered Korean women and children, but by the 1990s, too much information reached North Korea to prevent their learning that South Korea had a much stronger economy and higher living standards and quality of life, including political and social freedom, and as a result, North Korean propaganda admitted to it. However, their line taken was that this had not managed to prevent their South Korean brethren from yearning for the unification of their land and of \\"racial-purification\\" of their peoples. =Racial pride= North Korean propaganda often invokes Koreans as the purest of races, with a mystical bond with the natural beauty of the landscape. The color white is often invoked as a symbol of this purity, as in a painting of the \\"Fatherland Liberation War\\" (or Korean War) which depicts female partisans washing and hanging out white blouses, despite the way it would have made them visible to attack. In contrast to Stalinist depictions of people steeling themselves, preparing themselves intellectually, and so growing up and becoming fit to create Communism, the usual image in North Korean literature is of a spontaneous virtue that revolts against intellectualism but naturally does what is right. Stories often have only mildly flawed Korean characters, who are easily reformed because of their inherently pure nature. This device has resulted in problems such as lack of conflict and hence dullness. South Korea is often depicted as a place of dangerous racial contamination. =\\"Military first\\"= Songun, or \\"military first\\", propaganda Under Kim Jong-il, a major theme was the need of Kim to attend to the military first of all (in North Korea, this policy is called Songun), which required other Koreans to do without his close attention. This was a shift from the former policy of economic reform and diplomatic engagement. This military life is presented as something that Koreans take spontaneously to, though often disobeying orders from the highest of motives. The diplomatic offensive had failed to yield a normalization of relations with Japan. Meanwhile, relations with Russia remain cold and China was applying direct pressure on Pyongyang, thereby changing the dynamic of the long- standing relationship between the two erstwhile allies. =Devotion to the state= Romance is often depicted in stories as being triggered solely by the person's model citizenship, as when a beautiful woman is unattractive until a man learns she volunteered to work at a potato farm. =Social Control= The capital city of North Korea has witnessed tight, inflexible social control since Kim Il-sung's rule, during as well as after Kim Jong-il's rule. The aerial bombardment of North Korean population centers inflicted the greatest loss of civilian life in the Korean War, which the North Koreans have claimed ever since was America's greatest war crime. CPV soldiers helped rebuild bridges, elementary schools, factories, and apartments. In February 1955, the 47th Brigade of the CPV rebuilt the Pyongyang Electric Train Factory. The city's reconstruction was supervised by Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), led by Kim Il-Sung and supported by the Soviets, was left with a scene of complete and utter destruction; with the exception of a handful of buildings Pyongyang had been completely flattened. For a young general with socialist ideals, this was seen as a clean slate, on top of which a new country, both physically and ideologically, could be built. Kim Jong-il favored grand scale buildings and monuments. The giant pyramid of the Ryugyong Hotel building, originally scheduled for completion in time for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989, is 105 stories tall. Work on the structure stopped in the early 1990s due to structural defects. The monuments dedicated to Kim Il Sung were not made to be habitable, rather, they need only to look grand. A twenty-meter bronze statue of Kim Il Sung, arm outstretched to encompass his city, sits atop Mansu Hill. Although North Korea suffered severe economic hardships in the 1990s, Kim Jong Il had his late father's Kumsusan Palace extensively renovated to house the Great Leader's remains, hiring Russian specialists to embalm the corpse for permanent display. The planning of Pyongyang was unique. It was laid out in a highly symmetrical pattern. Massive, concrete structures are erected with a harmony of pastels. They did not possess the technology to construct any other type of buildings. An example of this is the pyramidal Ryugyong Hotel. There were no advertisements except political banners and portraits of the two Kims, billboards, coffee shops, or anything to distract from the concrete structures. There is very little traffic in the city, outdoor activities are not encouraged, and an absence of public spaces that are usually used in daily life. Technology is in pitifully short supply in Pyongyang. Cell phones, the intranet, and the Internet are a luxury reserved for the DPRK elite. Internet access in North Korea is restricted to a small section of the elite who have received state approval, and to foreigners living in Pyongyang. In the absence of a broadband network, the only option is through satellite internet coverage which is available in some tourist hotels. Mobile phone use was banned in 2004, but service was re-introduced in 2008, jointly operated by the Egyptian Orascom company and the state-owned Korea Post and Telecommunications Corporation. According to the Daily NK website, the new service, despite its cost, proved popular among affluent party members in Pyongyang. =Women in North Korea= The cultural identity of North Korea was deeply rooted in Confucian tradition and intractable Confucian family traditions. Women's identity is seen through the prism of familial relationships. It became a primary aspect of women's lives irrespective of prevalent political regime or social circumstances. Women were considered angels which men had to protect. Women in representative propaganda productions, such as Sea of Blood and The Flower Girl, became not only the focal point of visual composition within the traditional family structure but also the agents of ideological awakening for the newly founded socialist state. Revolutionary operas and numerous other productions depicted as well as forged the new gender order within the structure of the \\"imagined\\" family, which gained supremacy over blood ties. The imagined family was deemed by the degree of commitment to ideological and political struggle, which separated \\"us\\" from the \\"enemy.\\" Thus, imagining a family was perceived as a process of liberating women and motivating them to have a larger social presence. The colonial experience under occupation by the Japanese, who were traditionally despised as \\"barbarians,\\" propelled Koreans to evaluate their weakness vis-√†-vis the concrete threat to their national sovereignty. Women's backwardness was regarded as directly related to national weakness. In light of their nation's fragile future, Koreans thought women's backwardness to stem from the traditional family life, one of the most ancient institutions in Korean society. Women joined the labor front upon the outbreak of the Korean War. As manpower was concentrated on warfare, industry and agriculture were left to women's care. But even after the war, the North Korean leadership urged women to continue participating actively in the reconstruction of society. The practical social demand created the need for a female labor force and thus women's emancipation from the domestic sphere was legitimized under the pretext of \\"achieving gender equality.\\" As Hunter points out: \\"In 1947, only 5 percent of industrial workers were women; by 1949, the number had jumped to 15 percent. By 1967, women accounted for almost half of the total workforce.\\" North Korea is a fashion-conscious nation where political leaders strive to dress its people through rigid regulations, imposing uniforms on various social sectors and systematically recommending certain designs to civilians. Some other socialist and authoritarian states glorified masculine clothing as a preferred means to represent revolutionized women. Contrarily, North Korean fashion has continuously expressed degrees of femininity, contradicting the astringent revolutionary spirit often identified with masculinity. =Food shortage= The North Korean famine was admitted within propaganda to be solely a \\"food shortage\\", ascribed to bad weather and failure to implement Kim's teachings, but unquestionably better than situations outside North Korea. The government urged the use of non-nutritious and even harmful \\"food substitutes\\" such as sawdust. Practices Propaganda poster Every year, a state-owned publishing house releases several cartoons (called geurim-chaek () in North Korea), many of which are smuggled across the Chinese border and, sometimes, end up in university libraries in the United States. The books are designed to instill the Juche philosophy of Kim Il-sung (the \\"father\\" of North Korea)‚Äîradical self-reliance of the state. The plots mostly feature scheming capitalists from the United States and Japan who create dilemmas for na√Øve North Korean characters. The propaganda in North Korea is controlled mainly by the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Workers Party of Korea. =Posters= Posters depict the correct actions for every part of life, down to appropriate clothing. North Korean Propaganda posters are very similar to the messages portrayed by Socialist countries. North Korean propaganda posters focus on military might, utopian society and devotion to the state, and the leader's personality. Kim Jong-il is credited with using propaganda art and posters to make the Kim family's identity inseparable from the state. =Art= Propaganda poster in a primary school at the Chongsan-ri Farm. Fine art often depicts militaristic themes. The Flower Girl, a revolutionary opera allegedly penned by Kim Il-Sung himself, was turned into a movie, the most popular one in North Korea. It depicts its heroine's sufferings in the colonial era until her partisan brother returns to exact vengeance on their oppressive landlord, at which point she pledges support for the revolution. =Music= The country's supreme leaders have had hymns dedicated to them that served as their signature tune and were repetitively broadcast by the state media: *\\"Song of General Kim Il-sung\\" (for Kim Il-sung) * \\"Song of General Kim Jong-il\\" and \\"No Motherland Without You\\" (for Kim Jong-il) * \\"Footsteps\\", \\"Onwards Toward the Final Victory\\" and \\"We Will Follow You Only\\" (for Kim Jong-un) =Film= North Korea has a prolific propaganda film industry. The Korean government also runs a film industry. North Korean movies depict the glory of North Korean life and the atrocities of Western Imperialism, with a key role of providing on-screen role models. The film industry is run through Pyongyang University of Cinematic and Dramatic Arts. Kim Jong-Il was a self-proclaimed genius of film. In 1973, he authored On the Art of the Cinema, a treatise on film theory and filmmaking. He was rumored to own over 20,000 DVDs in his personal collection. Kim believed that Cinema was the most important of the arts. Domestically, these films are given lavish receptions. International critics cite the films as propaganda, because of their unreal depictions of North Korea. Recently, there has been an increase in animated films. The animated films carry political and military messages aimed at the youth of North Korea. =Leaflets= The North Korean government is known for dropping Propaganda leaflets to South Korean soldiers, just across the Demilitarized Zone. The leaflets are dropped across in a floating balloon. The leaflets criticize the South Korean government and praise North Korea. Social media North Korea made its first entry into the social media market in 2010. The country has launched its own website, Facebook page, YouTube channel, Twitter account, and Flickr page. The profile picture of all social media accounts, according to the official Korean Central News Agency, is the Three Charters for National Reunification Memorial Tower, a monument in Pyongyang that \\"reflects the strong will of the 70 million Korean people to achieve the reunification of the country with their concerted effort.\\" *Uriminzokkiri: Uriminzokkiri is a website that provides Korean- language news and propaganda from North Korea's central news agency. The website offers translation in Korean, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and English. Uriminzokkiri means \\"on our own as our nation\\". The site includes articles entitled \\"South Korea's Pro-US/Japan Corporate Media: Endless Demonization Campaigns Against DPRK\\", \\"The Project for New American Century: The New World Order & The US's Continued CRIMES\\" and \\"Kim Jong-un Sends Musical Instruments to Children's Palaces\\". The website also contains a page for tv.urminzokkiri. This page contains videos showing news clips criticizing imperialist movements, clips showing the bravery of Korean people and the power of its military. *Facebook: The North Korean Facebook account appeared a week after the South Korean government blocked the North Korean Twitter account. The Facebook account is named Uriminzok (English: \\"Our race\\"). The page represents \\"the intentions of North and South Koreas and compatriots abroad, who wish for peace, prosperity, and unification of our homeland\\". There were over 50 posts on Uriminzokkiri's wall, including links to reports that criticize South Korea and the U.S. as \\"warmongers\\", photos of picturesque North Korean landscapes and a YouTube video of a dance performance celebrating leader Kim Jong-il, \\"guardian of the homeland and creator of happiness\\". *YouTube: The channel named \\"Uriminzokkiri\\" was opened in July 2010. It has uploaded over 11,000 videos, including clips that condemn and mock South Korea and the U.S. for blaming North Korea for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March 2010. The account has posted videos dubbing United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a \\"Maniac in a Skirt\\". The account had over 3,000 subscribers and over 3.3 million views as of 28 November 2012; by early 2015, numbers had grown to over 11,000 subscribers and more than 11 million views. On 5 February 2013, a propaganda film that featured New York in flames was blocked and then taken down after Activision pointed out that the video used copyrighted footage from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. The channel was shut down in 2017. *Twitter: The government's official Twitter account is also named Uriminzok (English: \\"Our race\\"). It gained 8,500 followers in the first week. As of 28 November 2012, the account had almost 11,000 followers and had sent out almost 5,000 tweets; by early 2015, the account had sent almost 13,000 messages and had close to 20,000 followers. In January 2011, the Korean-language account was hacked and featured messages calling for North Korean citizens to start an uprising. In April 2013, the country's Twitter account was hacked by the online activist group Anonymous. *Flickr: The Flickr account was started in August 2010 and deactivated in April 2013 but is now active from some point in 2017. The site included many pictures of Kim Jong-un receiving applause from the military; children eating, in school, and enjoying life; booming agriculture; and modern city life. The Urminzokkiri Flickr account was hacked by Anonymous in April 2013, as part of the group's attack on North Korea's social media accounts. Propaganda village Kij≈èngdong, Kij≈èng-dong or Kij≈èng tong is a village in P'y≈ènghwa-ri (Chos≈èn'g≈≠l: ÌèâÌôîÎ¶¨; Hancha: Âπ≥ÂíåÈáå), Kaesong-si, North Korea. It is situated in the North's half of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and is also known in North Korea as \\"Peace Village\\" (Chos≈èn'g≈≠l: ÌèâÌôîÏ¥å; Hancha: Âπ≥ÂíåÊùë; MR: p'y≈ènghwach'on). The official position of the North Korean government is that the village contains a 200-family collective farm, serviced by a childcare center, kindergarten, primary and secondary schools, and a hospital. However, observation from the South suggests that the town is actually an uninhabited Potemkin village built at great expense in the 1950s in a propaganda effort to encourage defections from South Korea and to house the DPRK soldiers manning the extensive network of artillery positions, fortifications and underground marshalling bunkers that abut the border zone.

Duding the Josephinism period the state implemented significant reforms that affected life of religious communities. In 1781 Patent of Toleration extended religious freedom to non-Catholic Christians living in Habsburg lands and was followed by 1782 Edict of Tolerance. By city government decision the old church was offered at auction and sold to the Zagreb Orthodox Parish for 4000 Austro- Hungarian forint. In 1848, during Revolutions of 1848, the Orthodox Parish added the suffix Serbian in its name since by that time the Serbs significantly outnumbered local Greeks and Aromanians. =Construction of new church= In 1861 initiative was launched to build new church on the site of a dilapidated old St. Marguerite church. Project was awarded to the architect Franjo Klein. In the same period when the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral was built, Zagreb Synagogue was also built according to the Franjo Klein project. Church was completed on 21 October 1866, and synagogue on 27 September 1867. In 1897, after completion of urbanization of square south to the church, architect Hermann Boll√© proposed plan of monumental reorganization of church. This plan was never implemented, but the same architect developed a plan for restoration of bell tower in its modern-day shape in 1899, and in 1913 based on his plan fa√ßade was restored. =World War II= During World War II collaborationist Croatian Usta≈°e regime of Independent State of Croatia seized all property Serbian Orthodox Church and determined that the cathedral would be the central church of Croatian Orthodox Church, which was a part of the widespread persecution of Serbs.

Youth and parish priest Knabl was a son of the syndic Ambros Knabl, who had been mayor of Styria's capital Graz from 1784 to 1788. He attended school and studied theology in his home town, was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1811, and spent the following years as a chaplain and parish priest at various places in Styria. In 1838 he was assigned to parishes in what was then the immediate vicinity of Graz, first to Karlau and then to St. Andr√§. Epigraphist and historian Only at this time, already at an age of 49 years, Knabl began to devote himself to epigraphy and numismatics. Inspired by the large collection of Roman artifacts on display at the Joanneum (the largest museum in Graz) and at the castle of Seggau, he embarked on private investigations which in 1845 led to his discovery that the archeological finds near Leibnitz marked the site of the Roman town Flavia Solva. His first major paper,Knabl R. Wo stand das \\"Flavium Solvense\\" des C. Plinius? Schriften des historischen Vereines f√ºr Inner√∂sterreich, Vol. 1. Graz, 1848 published in 1848, presented such convincing epigraphic proof to this effect that the predominant academic opinion which had tentatively located Flavia Solva in the Zollfeld in Carinthia (actually the site of Virunum), quickly accepted it. From this time onward Knabl published significant findings from his research on an almost yearly basis, earning himself a reputation as one of his period's most important investigative historians of Roman times in the eastern Alpine region. Among other things, he was particularly interested in Roman traffic routes. He investigated the Roman road that had connected Claudia Celeia (now Celje) and Poetovio (now Ptuj)Knabl R. Der wahre Zug der r√∂mischen Milit√§rstrasse von Cilli nach Pettau. In: Archiv zur Kunde √∂sterr. Geschichts-Quellen,hg.v. Akad.d.Wiss., Bd.26/1-2). Ed.

Die Peutinger‚Äôsche Tafel verglichen mit dem Treibacher und Neumarkter Meilensteine. Mitt. HV Steiermark 1850; 1:137‚Äì140 However, the central project of his life - a codex of all epigraphic finds from antiquity made in the area encompassing today's Austrian province of Styria and northern Slovenia, documenting about 600 inscriptions at 183 sites on its 728 pages - remained unpublished; the manuscript is kept at the University of Graz. Reception by academic historians Knabl's painstaking work, sustained over three decades and always adhering to the scientific standards of his time, earned him acceptance among accomplished historians such as Alfred von Arneth and Theodor Mommsen who in their official statements spoke highly of him. However, when they expressed their opinions in private, academic arrogance sometimes showed. For example, Mommsen (then a 40-year-old assistant professor in Berlin) wrote in a letter to a friend dated 8 September 1857: > \\"Number One among the sages in Graz is the priest Knabl, an aged type of 65 > who has applied himself to the stones in his late years. If he learns of a > Roman stone somewhere in Styria he will instantly travel there with comical > enthusiasm, and will then lie there reading for two or three days; with a > strong pretense at scholarship, but with even stronger respect shown towards > myself whom he eagerly kisses the hands, collecting fragments for my > biography. (...) However, his hobby is indeed useful and he has advanced > historical knowledge by a good bit, although he did it more with his short > legs than with his thick head...\\"Wickert L.: Theodor Mommsen. Eine > Biographie. Bd. III: Wanderjahre. Ed.: Klostermann V., Frankfurt/M. See p. > 603 Honors In 1861 the University of Graz honored Knabl with a doctorate. The Austrian emperor awarded him the Golden Service Medal in 1862 and the Austrian Medal for Science in 1864, and named him Imperial Counsellor in 1868. Knabl reciprocated by donating his numismatic collection to the University of Graz in 1867, followed by his remaining antiquities on 15 April 1868. When Knabl died in 1874, aged 85 years, the university collected his library of 1,456 volumes as per his testament.

It was excavated in 1977 and reconstructed in its present location. This dolmen from the New Stone Age is believed to have been destroyed in the 17th or 18th century, because its large stones lay scattered on the fields. Several of the stones were sunk into the ground, others had been carried away. As a result a considerable amount of the original material has been lost. Excavations revealed that the burial chamber originally comprised 20 to 24 upright stones and about 8 capstones. It had a side entrance; this type of grave is known as a passage grave. The open space between the uprights and the capstones was sealed in with dry stonework. The entire grave was probably covered by an earth mound originally. This site may have served as a burial ground for several generations. The dead were laid on the floor of the burial chamber and prepared for the afterlife by being buried with their traditional jewellery (Trachtenschmuck), earthenware jars and everyday implements.

P-47D of the 57th Fighter Group, Italy, 1944 The group was first activated as the 57th Pursuit Group in January 1941, flying P-40 Warhawks as part of the Army Air Corps Northeast Defense Sector (later assigned to the I Fighter Command) at Mitchel Field, New York. It trained in New England and provided air defense of the northeast after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was redesignated as the 57th Fighter Group (FG) in May 1942. The 57th FG was reassigned to the U.S. Army Middle East Force in Egypt. In June 1942 the pilots and 72 new P-40Fs loaded aboard the aircraft carrier at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, sailing 1 July. On 19 July, off the Gold Coast, they launched in four sections of 18 aircraft and flew to Accra, thence across Equatorial Africa to Palestine, officially becoming part of IX Fighter Command. However, prior to the group officially commencing operations, individual 57th FG pilots were attached to, and flew combat sorties with, P-40 squadrons of the Royal Air Force (RAF), South African Air Force (SAAF) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), belonging to No. 211 Group, Desert Air Force. In October 1942, the 57th FG officially began combat operations as a formation. The group took part in the Battle of El Alamein and, as part of Ninth Air Force, supported the Commonwealth Eighth Army's drive across Egypt and Libya, escorting bombers and flying strafing and dive-bombing missions against airfields, communications, and troop concentrations until Axis defeat in Tunisia in May 1943. The unit participated in the reduction of Pantelleria (May‚ÄìJune 1943) and the conquest of Sicily (July‚ÄìAugust 1943). For front-line operations in direct support of the Eighth Army from the Battle of El Alamein to the capitulation of enemy forces in Sicily, the group received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC). In an aerial battle over the Gulf of Tunis at Cape Bon in April 1943, the group destroyed approximately 74 of the enemy's transport and fighter aircraft while sending an equal number down to the sea and beaches to escape by crash landing. The 57th lost just six aircraft in this melee. Forever known by the 57th as the 18 April 1943 Goose Shoot ‚Äì \\"The Palm Sunday Massacre,\\" it received another DUC and it added four newly created aces. This action broke the German's aerial supply line and they surrendered Tunisia thirty days later. The 57th supported the British Eighth Army's landing at Termoli and subsequent operations in Italy, being reassigned to Twelfth Air Force in August 1943. It flew dive-bombing, strafing, patrol, and escort missions. Early in 1944, the group converted to P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft and flew interdiction operations in Italy. The group moved to Corsica on 30 March 1944 to operate as a separate task force. It flew interdiction missions against railroads, communication targets, and motor vehicles behind enemy lines, providing a minimum of 48 fighter-bomber sorties per day. During 9 days of combat operations during early April 1944, the 57th exceeded 50 sorties per day. While the group was stationed on Corsica, director William Wyler made a 45-minute long Technicolor documentary film, Thunderbolt!. filming combat missions of the 57th. The film concentrated on Operation Strangle. The film was released for the military in 1945 and for general release in 1947.YouTube Movie, \\"Thunderbolt\\". Retrieved 20 May 2012 The group earned a third DUC c. 14 April 1944 for attacks in the Florence-Arezzo area. The group participated in the French campaign against Elba in June 1944 and in the invasion of Southern France in August. It engaged in interdiction and support operations in northern Italy from September 1944 to May 1945. For its operations in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, the 57th earned the French Croix de Guerre with Palm (awarded in late 1967). It was inactivated on 13 April 1953. The group remained in northern Italy after the end of the European War, demobilizing throughout the summer of 1945. It was reassigned to the United States in August 1945 and was inactivated at the end of August. =Cold War= Lockheed P-80 Shooting Stars of the 57th Fighter-interceptor Group, 1950 The group was reactivated in August 1946 and assigned to Alaskan Air Command as part of the air defense forces in the northwest Pacific. The group assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 343d Fighter Group, which was simultaneously inactivated at Shemya Army Air Base.Maurer, Combat Units, 221‚Äì222 It provided air defense initially in the Aleutian Islands, then moved in 1947 to Elmendorf Air Force Base. In 1948, as a result of the wing/base reorganization of the Air Force (Hobson Plan), the group became part of the 57th Fighter Wing, which included three support groups in addition to the group. In January 1950, it was redesignated as the 57th Fighter-Interceptor Group. In January 1951, its parent 57th Fighter-Interceptor Wing inactivated, although the group remained active as part of the AAC air defense until 1 November 1952 when its personnel were reassigned and it became a paper unit. It was inactivated on 13 April 1953. The group was reactivated at Paine Field, WA as the 57th Fighter Group (Air Defense) and assigned to Air Defense Command's Seattle Air Defense Sector, assuming the equipment and personnel of the 326th Fighter Group, which was simultaneously inactivated. It was assigned the 64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was already at Paine with the 326th flying Convair F-102 Delta DaggersCornett & Johnson, p. 118 as its operational element and also several support units as it assumed USAF host unit duties at Paine.Cornett & Johnson, p. 137Cornett & Johnson, p. 145 It provided air defense over the Pacific Northwest. In June 1966, it briefly became non-operational when its 64th Squadron moved to Southeast Asia and was assigned away from the group. However, after two weeks, the 498th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron, flying Convair F-106 Delta Darts,Cornett & Johnson, p. 130 moved to Paine and became the group's new operational squadron. It was inactivated 30 September 1968 when Air Defense Command closed its facilities at Paine AFB. =From 1991= On 1 November 1991, the group was redesignated the 57th Operations Group and activated as a result of the 57th Fighter Wing implementing the USAF objective wing organization. The 57 OG was assigned control of the wing's tactical units. Upon activation, the 57th OG managed Air Force tactical training through Red Flag and Air Warrior exercises. Between July 1995 and March 2002, the group gained the three MQ-1 Predator reconnaissance squadrons. The Group deployed the Predator elements of the 11th and 15th Squadrons in support of operations in Bosnia (April 2000), Kuwait (October 2000), and Pakistan, September 2001 ‚Äì January 2002 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The 57th Group's 66th Helicopter Squadron also deployed for operations in Northern Watch and Enduring Freedom. While at Nellis, the Group continued to provide air combat units for US and Allies with realistic, large force combat training at Red Flag. From 1 July 2005 to 1 March 2018 the group was non-flying as the flying squadrons of the 57th were split off into the new 57th Adversary Tactics Group, which consolidated all Aggressor activities under one group to provide the Combat Air Forces with the opportunity to train against a realistic, fully integrated threat array during large- and small-scale exercises such as Red Flag ‚Äì Nellis, Red Flag ‚Äì Alaska, Maple Flag, Green Flag and dissimilar air combat training deployments. On 2 March 2017 the group activated the 24th Tactical Air Support Squadron and once again is flying the F-16.

The surprise patriot victory at El Roble as a result of Bernardo O'Higgins' actions at the end of the day was to result in a change of patriot commander, and a severe split within the patriot movement. Background General Jos√© Miguel Carrera planned to seize the city of Chill√°n from royalist hands, and had divided his army into two parts. One part, under the command of his brother Juan Jose was sent two kilometres beyond the confluence of the Itala and √ëuble rivers. The other part, under Carrera's own command, went three leagues further east to cross at the paso el Roble.The 'oak tree crossing'. Having discovered Carrera's plans, Juan Francisco Sanchez, the royalist commander in Chill√°n, decided to destroy the patriot army in a surprise attack. He ordered his officers to send a force across the Itata river at night, moving it into position on the south bank of the river, to the east of the patriot forces. To the north, the royalist placed a force of 400 men under the control of Juan Antonio Olate, with the task of preventing the patriots from crossing the river. The battle At dawn on the 17 October, the royalist forces launched their surprise attack on Carrera's forces, creating panic in their ranks. Carrera, believing his army defeated, drove his horse into the Itata river and retreated from the battle to avoid capture. Meanwhile, then Colonel Bernardo O'Higgins had kept his composure from the start of the shooting and, gathering about two hundred men around him, ran to protect the artillery and organise the resistance. He was joined by captains Jose Joaquin and Diego Jose Benavente forming a respectable little force. After about an hour or more of fighting, O'Higgins became impatient. Taking a gun from a fallen soldier and brandishing it, he shouted: > \\"Lads! To me! Live with honour, or die with glory! The one who is brave is > the one who follows me!\\" The troops, encouraged by the example of O'Higgins, charged forward with him and drove the enemy into rapid retreat. Although injured in the leg, O'Higgins continued to lead the pursuit of the enemy on foot, until the royalists had crossed back over the river in total confusion. The aftermath The royalists left more than 80 dead in the battlefield, whilst the patriots had suffered thirty casualties. The greatest impact, however, was off the battle field. For the patriot army, this was their first victory against the royalist forces, which would be well remembered. For Jos√© Miguel Carrera, his retreat from the battlefield would cause him to lose support from Santiago, and result in his replacement by Bernardo O'Higgins, leading in turn to the battle of Las Tres Acequias the following year.

It in the north of the Tehuantepec District, which is in the west of the Istmo Region. History The name Guevea comes from the variant of the Zapotec language of the local people, and means \\"flower of muddy water or lily of the river\\". A painting on cotton cloth from 1540 depicts the town and its neighbor Santo Domingo Petapa. The picture records the history of the people from the time of their migration from Zaachila up to the Spanish conquest, and was designed to establish ancient property rights. The painting records that the town's first Spanish ruler was one Pedro Santiago. The town was called Guevea Santiago until 1936, when the state government changed the name to Guevea Humboldt, naming it after the botanist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt who spent some time in the town. Environment The municipality covers an area of 515.43 km¬≤. The town lies at an elevation of 620 meters above sea level. The region is mountainous, on the height of land between the north and south watersheds of the Sierra Mixe. The climate is warm, with most rainfall in the summer. Vegetation includes pine, oak, mahogany, ceiba, cedar and tropical fruit species. Wild fauna include as jaguar, tapir, deer Mazatec, tepeizcuinte, toucan, mockingbird and rattlesnake. Economy As of 2005, the municipality had 1,265 households with a total population of 5,283 of whom of 2,475 spoke an indigenous language. It is accessible via a dirt road that connects it with Santa Mar√≠a Guienagati. Economic activities include cultivation of coffee, sugar cane, rice and coconuts, as well as corn, beans and fruits on a smaller scale. Some people raise cattle, pigs, goats and poultry and practice hunting and fishing for local consumption. Some logging extracts fine woods from the forests for furniture manufacturing. In 1982 the farmers of Guevea de Humboldt and Santa Mar√≠a Guienagati, with advice from Jesuit mission team from the Diocese of Tehuantepec, formed the Union of Indigenous Communities of the Isthmus Region to help gain better prices for their coffee crop. They were later joined by farmers from other communities in the Sierra Mixe and northern Isthmus region. The cooperative, which gained legal status in 1983, assists in technical and financial assistance for local manufactures, as well as storage, transportation and national and international marketing of the products, of which the most important is coffee. As it matured, it paid increased attention to the requirements of women and youth, and to health, education and nutrition. The cooperative gained certification for its members' organic farming, and has established links to fair trade organizations to improve the prices received.

It is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus. Asha is located in the center of the Mesaoria valley. The village was recorded as early as the early 13th century in papal documents. Before 1974, the population of Asha was approximately 2,700. The village consisted of two parishes, St. John's and St. George's. The village had five churches: St. George, St. John Prodromos, St. Theodore, St. Spyridon and Virgin Mary. St. Spyridon was born in Ashahttp://www.assia.org.cy/agios- spiridon and the church was built by Michael Kassialos, a folk artist from Asha.http://www.assia.org.cy/prosopa/michael-kashalos Asha was also well known for the craftsmanship of the embroidery made there. The main source of income in the area was farming and many agricultural products of Asha were sold to Nicosia's markets. Asha was also famous for its cucumbers. After years passed more Turks settled in the village and Greeks left then some Turks left and some Greeks came back and it was like that until 1960. So it was half Turkish half Greek after 1827 to 1960 then after the Turkish invasion of 1974, it was just Turkish. Name Some believe that the name of the village comes from \\"Askia\\" which in Greek means \\"without any shade\\" and refers to the fact that there were very few trees in the area in and around Asha and therefore a lack of shade.http://www.assia.org.cy/assia-historical-reference/60 Over the centuries the pronunciation of the name changed from \\"Askia\\" to \\"Ashia\\". S. Menandros, in his book \\"Toponomy of Cyprus\\" (Athens, 1907), writes: \\"An old village called Ashia is mentioned many times in texts from the period of the French kingdom of Cyprus and is believed to have constituted the baliazzo d'Œëscha according to Venetian census. In the \\"Assises\\" the name is spelled Aschia, Œëchia, Asquie and According to Maheras Askia and Ahea. All evidence suggests that despite the differences in spelling, all the double consonants in the name, i.e. sh, sk, sq or ch, were most probably pronounced similarly to the heavy Italian sc.\\" There is also the popular belief that the name comes from the Greek word \\"aski\\" (plural \\"askia\\") which is a type of vessel for carrying liquids, mainly water and wine, made of animal skin (sheep, goat). During some legendary feasts, which included drinking competitions, the people of Asha claimed that the name of the village came from the fact that they could consume so many \\"askia\\" of wine. Location Asha is one of the largest villages in the central part of the Mesaoria valley, in the district of Famagusta. It is located on the old Nicosia-Famagusta road, about 14 miles east from Nicosia and 24 miles west from Famagusta. West, and almost adjacent to Asha, is Afania. East is Vatili. To the north is Angkastina, Marathovounos, Mousoulita and Stroggylos. To the south, a little further than the villages mentioned above, where Tremetousia, Arsos, Athienou and two small Turkish Cypriot villages, Agia and Melousia. To the north of the village extends the valley of Mesaoria. The land was fertile and was the major source of wheat for the island. In older times, the valley also produced cotton, sesami, grapes and a variety of vegetables. The land is so fertile mainly because of the river Yialias, which both supplied the necessary irrigation but also deposited rich soil over the adjacent farmland. Water from Yialias was diverted to the surrounding areas through an old system of irrigation channels. The area to the south, known as Trachonas, is less fertile and depends largely on rain but also some wells. Most of this area was used to either grow barley or as grazing land for sheep. There were, however, a few areas where vegetables were grown. Sports Ethnikos Assia (Greek: ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ 'ŒëœÉœÉŒπŒ±œÇ) is a Cyprus football team currently playing in the Cypriot Third Division. The team was established in Assia, Famagusta, but since the Turkish invasion of 1974, Ethnikos became a refugee team. The club is now based in the capital Nicosia and play their home games at the Makario. The club has played three times in the first division, the last time was during the 2001-02 season. A second team established in Asha, \\"Omonia\\", ceased to exist following the invasion.

The municipality covers an area of 93.14 km¬≤. It is part of the Silacayoapam District in the Mixteca Region. As of 2005, the municipality had a total population of 1371. Name The name Ixpantepec Nieves comes from two native words, Ixpan which means at the front, or surface, and Tepetl which means hill. Those two words together mean \\" The surface hill, or the hill at the front\\". History Ixpantepec Nieves was founded in 1800 during the time when pro-independence groups from all over the country were planning on striking against the Spanish king that ruled New Spain on that time. At first it was founded by no more than ten families that settled on the Yucuyia hill. Yacuyia means volcano hill and it is a native word as well as the name of the municipality.Today Ixpantepec Nieves is a lonely town because most of its population has migrated to other countries looking for a better way of life, this is due to the high unemployment rates and the scarce opportunities to get out of poverty. Economic Activities This town bases its economy on four basic economic activities which are: Agriculture, cattle raising, logging and commerce. Although there are four major economic activities, agriculture is the most important one, with 80 percent of the town's population working on it, some for self consumption and some for selling. Only 10 percent of the town's population raise cattle; this percentage is divided between cows, pork and sheep. The other ten percent of the population mainly relies on commerce to earn money to support their families; they sell hats and other products made out of palm tree leaves. Only a minimum percentage of the population work on logging, but that activity has been disappearing since the surrounding area of the town was declared protected zone in 2001. According to the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI), for its initials in Spanish, in 2000 the economically active population of Ixpantepec Nieves was around 258 persons. From those people, around 116 of them work on the primary economic sector including activities like agriculture, cattle raising, hunting and fishing. Other 57 people work on the secondary economic sector which includes mining, manufacturing, construction and oiling. The rest of the economically active population works on the tertiary economic sector which consists of tourism, commerce and services. Communication and social infrastructure Communication and social infrastructure refers to all the public works that the municipality counts on such as hospitals, schools and roads. Talking about education, Ixpantepec Nieves has a primary and a secondary school, both located near the downtown of the municipality. It also counts with a social assistance clinic from the I.M.S.S., or Mexican Institute of Social Security for its initials in Spanish. Ixpantepec Nieves also has a public market where people buy food and supplies for the house, there are two grocery stores and a \\"tianguis\\" which is similar to the market but the difference is that people sell their products on the street, those products are mainly fresh food like fruits, vegetables and sometimes chicken and meat. This municipality has two public basketball courts which are open every day at every time. According to the results of the 2005 population and housing count, Ixpantepec Nieves has 350 houses where 342 of them are owned by particulars.
