Page, whose real name is Teddy Chiu, began his career as a young man in the early 1980s, directing low-budget action movies for producer K.Y. Lim's Silver Star Film Company (known as Kinavesa in the Philippines). Career Most of them starred the same prolific group of European and American expatriate actors working in the Philippines in the 1980s: Mike Monty, Bruce Baron, Romano Kristoff, James Gaines, Eric Hahn, Mike Cohen, Ann Milhench, Gwendolyn Hung, Ronnie Patterson and Ken Watanabe (not to be confused with the Japanese actor of the same name). Former Spaghetti Western and peplum star, Richard Harrison, appeared in three of Page's films, Fireback, Hunter's Crossing and Blood Debts (1983). Many of his earlier efforts were written or co-written by Watanabe, Kristoff, Gaines or Harrison using a pseudonym. The majority of Page's films have been generally classified as Z-movies, characterized by loose, seemingly improvised narrative (Fireback, for example, is supposed to take place in the United States, but the setting suddenly changes to \\"The Jungle\\" for the last third of the film), bizarre plot twists, and comically bad acting accentuated by equally poor dubbing. Gratuitous, often sadistic violence is mixed with near childlike naivety, with characters having comic book names like \\"Panther\\" and \\"Cat Burglar\\". Another trademark of the earlier Page films were oversized, customized special weapons, which feature prominently in Fireback and Blood Debts. The Silver Star productions are infamous for their extremely low budgets, which might have also contributed to the low technical quality. In the book Gods In Spandex, Richard Harrison states that the Page films he appeared in didn't have complete shooting scripts and many scenes were improvised, hence the disjointed narrative. However, it can be said that Page's early films are particularly bad, even on the admittedly low Silver Star standards, but they have attracted some cult interest, especially in French B-movie fandom. There is very little information on Teddy Page in print or online. He is discussed briefly in pieces by Richard Harrison and John P. Dulaney in the books Gods in Polyester, Or, A Survivors' Account of 70's Cinema Obscura (2004) and Gods In Spandex, Or, A Survivors' Account of 80's Cinema Obscura (2007). He is also mentioned in passing in interviews of Bruce Baron, Nick Nicholson and Mike Monty at the French B-movie website Nanarland. He is still working as a director on films and television in the Philippines, now using his real name (Teddy Chiu). His last directing credit is the 1999 action film Anino. He has also worked as a Second Unit Director or assistant director, most recently in the 2001 film Xtreme Warriors.

The Gesta, which was written by an author known in modern scholarship as Anonymus in the second half of the 12th century or in the early 13th century, is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle. The Gesta did not refer to the enemies of the conquering Hungarians (or Magyars), who had been mentioned in earlier annals and chronicles, but wrote of a dozen persons, including Glad, who are unknown from other primary sources of the Hungarian Conquest. Therefore, modern historians debate whether Glad was an actual enemy of the conquerors or only a \\"fictitious person\\" made up by Anonymus. In Romanian historiography, Glad is described as one of the three Romanian dukes who ruled a historical region of present-day Romania in the early 10th century. According to the Gesta, Glad came from Vidin in Bulgaria. He occupied Banat with the assistance of \\"Cumans\\" before the arrival of the Magyars. Anonymus wrote that Cumans, Bulgarians, and Vlachs (or Romanians), supported Glad against the invading Magyars, but the latter annihilated their united army in a battle near the Timi»ô River. The Gesta presents Ahtum, who ruled Banat in the early 11th century, according to the longer version of the Life of St Gerard, as Glad's descendant. Background The earliest record of the Magyars (or Hungarians) is connected to their alliance with the Bulgars against a group of Byzantine prisoners who were planning to cross the Lower Danube in an attempt to return to their homeland around 837 AD. They dwelled in the steppes north and northwest of the Black Sea. A group of rebellious subjects of the Khazar Khaganate, known as Kabars, joined them, according to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus. The Annals of St. Bertin states that the Magyars launched their first military expedition against the Carolingian Empire in 861. The Magyars invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Empire in 894. In retaliation, the Bulgars entered into an alliance with the Pechenegs. They jointly invaded the Magyars' lands, forcing them to leave the Pontic steppes and cross the Carpathian Mountains in search of a new homeland. In the Carpathian Basin, the Magyars \\"roamed in the wildernesses of the Pannonians and Avars\\" before attacking \\"the lands of the Carinthians, Moravians and Bulgars\\",The Chronicle of Regino of Pr√ºm (year 889), p. 205. according to the contemporaneous Regino of Pr√ºm. The Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin is the principal subject of the Gesta Hungarorum, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle. Most scholars agree that a notary of B√©la III of Hungary, who ruled between 1173 and 1196, wrote the Gesta after the king's death. According to an alternative theory, the author of the Gesta, who is now known as Anonymus, had served B√©la II of Hungary before starting to complete his work around 1150. Anonymus did not write of Svatopluk I of Moravia, Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia and the invading Magyars' other opponents who had been mentioned in works written in earlier centuries. Neither did he refer to the Magyars' fights with the Moravians, Franks and Bavarians which had been described in earlier annals and chronicles. On the other hand, Anonymus wrote of local polities and rulersincluding Gelou, the Vlach duke of Transylvania, Menumorut, the lord of the regions between the rivers Mure»ô, Some»ô and Tisza, and Salanus, the Bulgar ruler of the lands between the Danube and the Tiszaunknown from other primary sources.  Banat on the eve of the Hungarian Conquest  Stirrups, horse bits and spear points from inhumation graves unearthed at S√¢npetru German suggest that the Avars settled along the Mure»ô River in Banat soon after their conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the late 560s. However, most archaeological finds in the lands south of the Mure»ô that had been attributed to the Avars are dated to the \\"Late Avar\\" period. Written sources show the survival of Gepids under Avar rule in the wider region of the Timi»ô River. For instance, the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of \\"three Gepid settlements\\"The History of Theophylact Simocatta (viii. 3.11.), p. 213. which were destroyed by an invading Byzantine army in 599 or 600. A rich burial yielding weapons unearthed at Panƒçevo and the Treasure of S√¢nnicolau Mare show that an important center of power existed in Banat in the \\"Late Avar\\" period, according to archaeologist Florin Curta. However, \\"Late Avar\\" cemeteries did not survive the 8th century. The Franks launched a series of expeditions against the Avar Khaganate in 790s, causing its disintegration. Krum of Bulgaria, who reigned between around 802 and 814, soon tried to take advantage of the fall of the Avars and invaded former Avar territories, but no contemporaneous report mentioned his conquest in the Carpathian Basin. The Abodrites who lived in \\"Dacia on the Danube as neighbors of the Bulgars\\" sent envoys to Emperor Louis the Pious in 824, complaining \\"about vicious aggression by the Bulgars\\"Royal Frankish Annals (year 824), p. 116. and seeking the emperor's assistance against them, according to the Royal Frankish Annals. The Abodrites inhabited the lands along either the Timi»ô or the Tisza. According to a memorial inscription from Provadia, a Bulgar military commander, Onegavonais, drowned in the Tisza, implying Omurtag of Bulgaria's attempts to expand his rule in the region in the 820s. The Bulgars invaded Moravia in 863 and 883, suggesting that they controlled at least the crossing- points across the rivers Mure»ô and Tisza, according to the historian Istv√°n B√≥na. B√≥na writes that the Bavarian Geographer is the last source which contains contemporaneous information of the eastern regions of the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century. According to this source, which is actually a list of the tribes inhabiting the lands east of the Carolingian Empire around 840, the Merehani, who had 30 civitates, or fortified centers, lived along the southernmost parts of the empire's eastern frontiers. Their land also bordered on Bulgaria. According to an alternative theory of the location of Moravia, which is primarily based on the Bavarian Geographer and Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus's report of \\"great Moravia, the unbaptized\\",Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 40), p. 177. Banat was the center of this early medieval polity, which was annihilated by the conquering Magyars. Archaeologist Silviu O»õa identifies the Merehani with the Abodrites, adding that they were obviously a Slavic tribe. The name of the Kara≈° and other rivers implies that a population speaking a Turkic languageAvar, Bulgar, or Pechenegalso inhabited the Banat in the Early Middle Ages, but those rivers may have received their names only in the 11th or 12th centuries. Historian Vlad Georgescu writes that archaeological research has proven the existence of about 60 settlements in Glad's duchy. Other historians, including SƒÉlƒÉgean and Pop, say that the earth-and-wooden or stone fortresses unearthed at Bulci, Cenad, Ilidia, Or»ôova, Pescari, and Vladimirescu were Glad's forts. Florin Curta says that the dating of these sites is uncertain. Anonymus's narration =Glad and his duchy= The first page of the sole manuscript preserving the text of the Gesta Hungarorum, the only chronicle which mentions Glad Glad's duchy: the map presents the duchies of Glad, Gelou and Menumorut in accordance with Anonymus's report, but Salan's duchy in the map is lesser than it is described in the Gesta Hungarorum; the map also depicts \\"Great Moravia\\" and Braslav's duchy in Lower Pannonia which are not mentioned by Anonymus According to the Gesta Hungarorum, Rus' princes gave a short description of the Carpathian Basin to the Magyar commanders before they decided to invade the territory. The princes told them that \\"Slavs, Bulgarians, Vlachs, and the shepherds of the Romans\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 9.), p. 27. inhabited the territory. In short, Anonymus continued, one of the princes, the Prince of Halych, also informed the Magyar leaders of the polities among which the territory was divided and their rulers. Among these local rulers, the Rus' prince listed Glad who had \\"taken possession of the land from the river Mure»ô up to the castle\\" of UrsuaAnonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 11.), pp. 32‚Äì33. (Or≈üova or Vr≈°ac) with the help of the Cumans. In another chapter of the Gesta, Anonymus wrote that Glad \\"held power from the Mure»ô River to the castle of Palanka\\",Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 44.), p. 95. showing that he identified Glad's duchy with the territory that is now known as Banat. Anonymus explicitly referred to Glad as \\"the prince of that country\\" in the same chapter. The Gesta did not write of the peoples inhabiting Glad's duchy. On the other hand, it stated that Glad commanded \\"a great army of horsemen and foot soldiers\\" and his army was \\"supported by Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs\\". According to Tudor SƒÉlƒÉgean and other Romanian historians, the list of the peoples reflects the one-time ethnic composition of the Banat, showing that a Turkic people (Pechenegs, Avars or Kabars), Bulgarians and Vlachs, or Romanians, inhabited the region in the late 9th century. Historian Victor Spinei writes that Anonymus's reference to the \\"Cumans\\" supporting Glad's army shows that Glad sought the Pechenegs' assistance against the invading Magyars. Anonymus wrote that Glad had come \\"from the castle of Vidin\\" and occupied his duchy \\"with the help of the Cumans\\".Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 11.), p. 33. This report, together with Anonymus's reference to the Bulgarians' assistance against the Magyars, suggests that Glad was subjected to Simeon I of Bulgaria, according to SƒÉlƒÉgean. This theory is not accepted by historian Ioan-Aurel Pop, who writes that it is only an \\"attractive\\" scholarly hypothesis which has not been proven. Madgearu says that the Banat, which had been an integral part of Bulgaria since the late 820s, became an independent state under Glad's rule after the death of Simeon I in 927. Pop also says Anonymus's reference to Glad's arrival from Vidin suggest that Glad was either Bulgarian or Romanian, because the region of that town was densely populated by Romanians. The name of Glad is most probably of South Slavic origin, according to Pop and Neagu Djuvara. In connection with Glad, Anonymus also emphasized that \\"from his line was born\\" a chieftain, named Ahtum, whom Stephen I of Hungary defeated in the first half of the 11th century, according to the Long Life of Saint Gerard. =The conquest of Banat= According to the Gesta Hungarorum, the Magyars conquered the lands between the Danube and the Tisza, Transylvania, the western regions of present-day Slovakia and Transdanubia before their supreme head, √Årp√°d, and his chieftains decided to send an army to invade Glad's duchy. They dispatched three commandersnamed \\"Zov√°rd, Kadocsa, and Vajta\\"with the task. The three commanders crossed the Tisza at Kanji≈æa and halted at the Csesztreg River before advancing as far as the Bega River. In the next two weeks, they forced the inhabitants of the region between the Mure»ô and Some»ô to yield and to give their sons as hostages. Thereafter, Anonymus continued, the Magyar army marched towards the Timi»ô and \\"encamped beside the ford of Foeni\\" where they wanted to cross the river. However, Glad and his large army awaited them on the other bank. A day later, Zov√°rd \\"enjoined his brother, Kadocsa, to go lower down with half his army and try to cross in any way in order to attack the enemy\\", and Kadocsa obeyed this command. Both divisions crossed the river and stormed the enemy camp. In the battle, \\"two dukes of the Cumans and three kneses of the Bulgarians were slain\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 44.), p. 97. before Glad decided to retreat, but his army was annihilated. Anonymus writes that Glad took shelter in \\"the castle of Kovin\\", while the Magyars marched to \\"the borders of the Bulgarians\\" and encamped at the Ponjavica River. Zov√°rd, Kadocsa and Vajta laid siege to Kovin, forcing Glad to surrender it three days later. In short, they also seized Or»ôova where they lived \\"for a whole month\\", according to the Gesta. Vajta returned to √Årp√°d, taking with him the hostages and the booty, while Zov√°rd and Kadocsa sent an envoy to √Årp√°d to ask permission to invade the Byzantine Empire. Ioan- Aurel Pop writes that Glad must have survived his defeat and recovered at least parts of his duchy in exchange for paying a tribute to the Magyars, because his descendant, Ahtum, ruled the territory some decades later, according to Anonymus. Glad in modern historiography The Carpathian Basin on the eve of the \\"Hungarian Conquest\\": a map based primarily on the narration of the Gesta Hungarorum from the late 19th-century Pallas Nagy Lexikona (\\"Great Encyclopedia of Pallas\\") Glad is one of the local rulers who are mentioned only in the Gesta Hungarorum. Historians have continuously debated the reliability of Anonymus's work which was first published in 1746. Anonymus's reference to the Cumans, Bulgarians and Vlachs supporting Glad is one of the key points in the scholarly debate, because the Cumans did not arrive in Europe before the 1050s. Vlad Georgescu, Victor Spinei, Ioan-Aurel Pop and many other Romanian historians identify the \\"Cumans\\", or Cumani, as Pechenegs, Avars or Kabars, saying that the Hungarian word that Anonymus translated as \\"Cuman\\" (kun) originally dubbed any Turkic tribe. According to other historians, including Dennis Deletant, Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy and Carlile Aylmer Macartney, Anonymus's reference to the three peoples is an anachronism, which reflects the ethnic composition of the late 13th-century Bulgaria. In Romanian historiography, Glad is presented as one of the three local \\"voivodes\\" who ruled territories inhabited by Romanians at the time of the Hungarian Conquest. Madgearu and Pop list almost a dozen place-names from the Banat and its wider region which suggest that settlements were named after Glad. For instance, a village named Cladova (formerly Galadua) and a monastery named Galad were first mentioned in 1308 and 1333, respectively, and an Ottoman document from 1579 referred to two villages named Glade≈° and a settlement named Kladova. Silviu O»õa writes that the theory of a connection between Glad and the name of those settlements is \\"considerably weak\\", because neither the origins nor the chronology of those place names have so far been thoroughly studied. O≈£a also says, \\"the historical geography of the Banat is reflected quite accurately in the chronicle\\", which suggests that Anonymus knew the geographical features of the region, but does not prove that Glad was a real person. According to Gy√∂rffy and other historians, Anonymus who invented all local rulers in the Gesta named Glad after the village where the monastery was built. Deletant, Macartney and other scholars also say that Anonymus seems to have borrowed many episodes of his narrative of Glad (including his connection with Vidin) from the story of his alleged descendant, Ahtum, in the Long Life of Saint Gerard.

The airplane, a Douglas DC-9, was carrying 31 passengers and crew. None of them survived the crash. Multiple eyewitnesses reported that the plane was on fire shortly after it took off from the airport. The fire was caused due to a failure on the right engine where one of its removable sleeve spacers detached. The removable sleeve spacer suffered metal fatigue which caused the engine to explode. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the investigation team who was responsible for the investigation of the crash, concluded that despite the plane suffering engine failure, it was still controllable, and instead the response of the crew to the failure was the main cause of the accident. The crew failed to properly control the plane during the emergency. Breakdown of the crew's coordination also contributed the crash. Aircraft On September 6, 1985, Flight 105 was a Midwest Express Airlines flight scheduled to be operated using a Douglas DC-9-14 twin-engine, single-aisle jet airliner (registration N100ME). The DC-9 was manufactured in 1968 and delivered to Linea Aeropostal Venezolana. In 1976, it was sold to Aerovias Venezolanas, S.A., who then sold it to K-C Aviation (the owner of Midwest Express) in 1983. The aircraft had accrued a total of 31,892 operating hours and 48,903 cycles at the time of the accident. Passengers and crew Flight 105 departed Milwaukee carrying 27 passengers and 4 crew members. Most of the passengers were businessmen. The two stewardess of the flight were 24-year old Sharon Ann Herb and 21-year old Amy Marie Bain. Instead of a captain and first officer, Flight 105 was crewed by two captains. The first captain of the flight was 31-year old Captain Danny Watkin Martin. Captain Martin was employed by Midwest Express in 1984 as a First Officer. He was promoted as a Captain in 1985 and had accumulated a total of 4,600 flight hours, including 1,000 hours on the DC-9 (600 flight hours as a First Officer on the DC-9, and 500 hours as a captain). Before he was an employee of Midwest, he was a corporate pilot of a Beechcraft 90 King Air. The second captain (though acting as a first officer) was 37-year old Captain Roger William Weiss. Captain Weiss was employed by Midwest Express in 1984 and later received his DC-9 type rating. At the time, he had accrued 5,197 total flight hours, including 1,640 hours on the DC-9 (500 hours as a First Officer of the DC-9 and 1,140 hours as a captain). He was a former employee of KC Aviation, the parent company of Midwest Express. Captain Weiss was also a former US Air Force pilot, flying an F-4. Flight Flight 105 took off at 15:20 with 27 passengers and 4 crew members. Flight 105 departed from Mitchell's Runway 19R en route to its destination of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Int'l Airport, Atlanta, Georgia. Before the flight, the plane had previously been operated as Flight 206 with the same flight crew. At 15:21, during its initial climb, at an altitude of 700 ft above the ground, the right engine exploded. Flight 105 swayed several times. Captain Martin heard the loud bang and reacted: \\"What the * was that?\\", which was not responded to by First Officer Weiss. Flight 105 was then instructed by the ATC to turn towards heading 175. At this stage, the ATC worker could see that smoke and flames were emanating from the right engine, with parts of the plane falling to the ground. First Officer Weiss declared an emergency. The plane then climbed with a high angle of attack. Due to the high angle of attack, the air speed decreased significantly. It began to roll to the right, and then stalled and rolled abruptly to an angle of 90 degrees, barrel-rolled at least once, and crashed into an open field in a wildlife preserve just several hundred meters from runway 19R. The aircraft was completely demolished by impact forces and fire, with nearly the entire structure fragmented. Eyewitnesses claimed that a few passengers and crew members survived the initial impact but succumbed to injuries or exposure to smoke, fire, and toxic fumes before help could reach them. Investigation Roughly 100 eyewitnesses stated that they saw flames and smoke from the right engine shortly after the explosion and that some parts of the plane detached and fell to the ground. They also stated that loud bangs were continuously heard during the accident. Shortly afterwards, the crew lost control of the plane and the plane crashed into the field. Investigators then constructed several possible scenarios as to what might have caused the plane to lose control. =Possible control failure due to turbine explosion= Investigators immediately examined the fragments of the engine. They stated that the explosion might have been powerful enough to propel fragments of the turbine with sufficient speed to penetrate the plane and damage the flight controls, which could explain why the plane suddenly pitched up and barrel-rolled immediately after the explosion. 5 years before the crash of Flight 105, in Poland an Ilyushin Il-62 crashed into a moat after its engine number 2 exploded and damaged the plane's elevator and aileron. Immediately after the explosion, the plane nosedived to the ground. The explosion was caused by a detached removable sleeve spacer inside the right engine. The detachment was caused by metal fatigue. Examination of the turbine fragments and their distribution during the explosion led to the conclusion that the ejection of the fragments didn't contribute to the crash, as the velocity of the fragments was substantially absorbed and decreased by the engine cowling. The NTSB noted that several parts of the engine could not be found; they concluded that, based on their calculation and distribution of the fragments on the ground, the unidentified parts were reduced to tiny, harmless bits. The left engine did not exhibit any signs of pre-impact damage or failure The NTSB also stated that, although the explosion caused serious damage to the engine cowling, the cowlings were all latched. None blew outwards, which would have caused a massive drag force on the plane. This, in turn, could have affected the controllability of the plane. Small portions of the cowling did blow outwards, but the NTSB concluded that these parts caused very little drag force. The NTSB later concluded that even if any turbine parts were ejected and somehow able to penetrate the plane, the impact would be small and no controls would be affected. =Pilot error= In the initial seconds after the explosion, Flight 105 swayed to the right and left. In response, the pilot used the rudder to counteract the plane's movements. The examination concluded that the plane was easily controllable and that it could still be controlled properly without the rudder inputs. Additionally, the crew made a pitch input, raising the aircraft's nose. The crew may have wrongly perceived the nature of the emergency. Since the explosion of the engine caused the loss of engine thrust, the speed of the plane decreased. This rapid deceleration caused the crew to think that the plane was pitching down, which may explain why the crew made a nose-up input, while in reality, it didn't pitch down. This phenomenon is known as a somatogravic illusion. However, instead of fixing the situation, the nose-up input that the crew made only caused the plane to decelerate even more. The pilot may have suffered spatial disorientation immediately after the emergency. Animation of an accelerated stall. The NTSB noted that the plane had banked to the right to such a severe angle that the plane entered a state which investigators call an \\"accelerated stall\\". =Cockpit breakdown= During the emergency, Captain Martin called for the instrument readings to First Officer Weiss. However, Weiss didn't reply to any of his questions or remarks. Since an emergency had occurred on board the plane, First Officer Weiss should have responded and worked with Martin in order to handle the emergency properly. Weiss' failure to respond may have further confused Captain Martin. Investigators stated that Weiss also might have been confused by the information on his instruments. They also stated that Weiss' action might have been influenced by Midwest Express' \\"silent cockpit\\" philosophy. Midwest Express expected its pilots to adhere to an unwritten policy called the \\"silent cockpit\\", where pilots would make no unnecessary callouts or even verbalize the nature of an emergency after 100 knots and before reaching an altitude of 800 ft. The emergency on board Flight 105 that day started at roughly 700 ft above the ground, meaning that the \\"silent cockpit\\" rule was in effect at the time. Investigators stated that the pilots should have worked together immediately since an emergency that occurred at low altitude was dangerous. With the silent cockpit rule, the crew's ability to effectively work together would have been hampered. This rule conflicted with FAA regulations and therefore should have been prohibited by the FAA. Seconds after the failure of the right engine, Captain Martin applied proper inputs to the plane. However, he was uncertain about the situation of Flight 105 at the time. Due to this, he asked First Officer Weiss for assistance. The NTSB, on their report, stated that Martin might have asked Weiss as he was far more senior and had more experience. He may have thought that Weiss was far more knowledgeable than him in identifying the nature of the emergency. Weiss didn't respond to any of Martin's remarks and questions. Based on the evidence from the CVR, investigators believe that Weiss actually heard Martin's questions and remarks but ignored them for some reason. He was not incapacitated, as evidence from the recordings indicated that he communicated with Milwaukee Tower while Martin was asking him about the information of the plane's instruments. Captain Martin held primary responsibility for handling the emergency and taking corrective actions. However, the emergency should have been handled by both men working together as a team. Weiss should have assisted the Captain in responding and diagnosing the problem that had occurred on board Flight 105. The NTSB stated: > \\"The redundancy provided by the First Officer is one the basic tenets of > Cockpit Resource Management.\\" The NTSB then concluded that breakdown in crew coordination was one of the main causes of the accident, one possibility being their youthfulness and inexperience--the combined age of the two captains was only 68. =Inexperience of the FAA= The lack of experience of an FAA officer might have caused the silent cockpit philosophy to be approved by the FAA without proper examination. The philosophy was contrary to the approved practice by the FAA. If she had more experience, she may have recognized that the concept had flaws, and that the airline was already teaching the concept to their employees. The NTSB believed that the FAA agent who worked with Midwest Express did not perform her duties at an adequate level. As per the final report: > \\"The safety board believes that the FAA oversight of Midwest Express > procedures and training during certification and ongoing day-to-day activity > in the carrier's first 2 years of operation was less than optimum and > probably suffered as a direct result of the inexperience of the POI.

It was then further developed by George Koltanowski. This variation of the Queen's Pawn Game is characterised by a systematic if modest development of White's to support a quick pawn move to the e4-square. The Colle is considered , but inflexible.

Colle System. 1980. Chess Enterprises, Inc. Players like Capablanca and Tal found ways to take the sting out of some of its various lines, however. One such line that has been tested is 3...Bf5, sometimes called the \\"Anti-Colle\\". Plan for White Ignoring Black's responses in order to consider White's moves only, the typical plan is as follows: :1.d4 2.Nf3 3.e3 4.Bd3 5.0-0 6.Re1 7.c3 8.Nbd2 9.e4, with White rearranging the move order appropriately. It is a perfectly solid scheme of development, but, inflexibly applied, it cannot offer more than equality against a vigorous Black response. It may be a good tool for avoiding book variations, for Blitz play, or for forcing opponents to think for themselves early on. These days it is considered totally innocuous,John Nunn, Graham Burgess, John Emms, and Joe Gallagher. Nunn's Chess Openings. Everyman Publishers, London, 1999. and is rarely seen at Master level or above. The strategic plan behind the Colle System is to aim for a kingside attack. The black king's knight will be either exchanged off on e4, or driven away by the advance e4‚Äìe5. This removes a guard from the h7 square, often enabling a classic bishop sacrifice on h7 as the start of a mating attack. Some authors even call this sacrifice \\"Colle's sacrifice\\". Colle‚ÄìZukertort System One variation of the Colle is the Colle‚ÄìZukertort System (named after Johannes Zukertort), characterized by developing the dark-squared bishop on b2. The typical plan is: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 e6 3.e3 Nf6 4.Bd3 c5 5.b3 Nc6 6.0-0 Bd6 7.Bb2 0-0, where White, despite their apparently innocuous development, will eventually play for a kingside attack. This system has been frequently employed at grandmaster level by Artur Yusupov.

It was first published as a serial in Black Mask magazine in 1930, then was collected in 1931 (in London; the American edition followed 3 months later). It tells the story of a gambler and racketeer, Ned Beaumont, whose devotion to Paul Madvig, a crooked political boss, leads him to investigate the murder of a local senator's son as a potential gang war brews. Hammett dedicated the novel to his onetime lover Nell Martin. There have been two US film adaptations (1935 and 1942) of the novel. A radio adaptation starring Orson Welles aired on March 10, 1939, as part of his Campbell Playhouse series.The Mercury Theatre on the Air The book was also a major influence on the Coen brothers' 1990 film Miller's Crossing, about a gambler who is a right-hand man to a corrupt political boss and their involvement in a brewing gang war. The Glass Key Award (in Swedish, Glasnyckeln), named after the novel, has been presented annually since 1992 for the best crime novel by a Scandinavian writer. Plot summary The story revolves around Ned Beaumont, a gambler and best friend of the criminal political boss Paul Madvig. Ned finds the body of a senator's son on the street, and Madvig asks him to thwart the D.A.'s investigation, his motive being that he wants to back the corrupt senator in order to marry his daughter, Janet. Ned goes to New York searching for Bernie, a bookie who owes him a great deal of money from a gambling debt but ends up getting beaten up. Someone sends a series of letters to people close to the crime, hinting that Madvig was the murderer. Suspicion for this falls on Madvig's daughter Opal, the victim's girlfriend. Madvig's political base begins to crumble when he refuses to spring a follower's brother from jail. The follower goes to rival mob boss Shad O'Rory, who eliminates a witness to the brother's crime. Madvig then declares war on O'Rory, who offers to bribe Beaumont to expose Madvig in the newspaper. Beaumont refuses, is knocked unconscious and wakes captive in a dingy room where he is beaten daily. Hospitalized after his escape, Beaumont tells Madvig and Janet that he was laying a trap for O'Rory; he then struggles out of bed to stop the newspaper from printing its expose. Beaumont confronts O'Rory, the publisher, and Madvig's daughter Opal. The publisher commits suicide, after Beaumont seduces his wife. Next Beaumont interviews Janet, discovering that she wrote the letters and that the Senator knew about the murder before Beaumont found the body. A new clue points to Madvig and when confronted he confesses but he cannot account for the victim's hat, a detail Beaumont pointedly repeats throughout the novel. This impasse and Beaumont's growing interest in Janet, Madvig's love interest, cause a second rift between the men. Beaumont and Janet pair up to solve the murder. Beaumont uncovers evidence proving the senator killed his own son and turns him over to the police. Beaumont confronts Madvig with his new discovery, and the two depart, not enemies but no longer friends.

Maxfield, \\"Hammett employs an objective approach, merely reporting the conversations and describing the surface actions of his characters, never directly presenting their thoughts and feelings\\".Maxfield, James F. (1985). \\"Hard-Boiled Dicks and Dangerous Females: Sex and Love in the Detective Fiction of Dashiell Hammett.\\" Clues 6.1: 107‚Äì123. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 2 Dec. 2012. This leaves some ambiguity in the reasoning of Ned Beaumont's actions, such as his suspicions about Janet Henry's father. This makes it hard to determine the nature of Ned's relationship with Janet. While there is disagreement about whether or not they are together at the end, the fact that there is a relationship at all is indicative of \\"a different kind of hero\\". =Beaumont compared to other Hammett heroes= Ned Beaumont does not fit the popular, famous archetype of Jung, nor the weaker, less altruistic \\"hero\\" type of Hammett's other works, but is altogether different from either. Hammett's detectives usually avoid relationships, but Ned is different. He does not possess the sort of \\"immunity\\" to emotional ties that the author's previous detectives had maintained, such as the Continental Op in Hammett's Red Harvest. Because of this supposed relationship between Ned and Janet, The Glass Key takes on a more traditional story line, that of the detective \\"hero\\" and his beautiful heroine, ending with a ride into the sunset of New York. According to Maxfield, \\"Neither the Op nor [Hammett's detective character] Sam Spade would have gone off with Janet, for as detectives they both strove to be ruled as much as possible by reason. But Beaumont is a gambler instead of a detective, a man used to taking risks. Just as he continues to bet while he is on a losing streak, he is willing to make another kind of wager on Janet, despite the great odds of the relationship ending badly. Because he is willing to accept the risks that human commitments entail, Beaumont is, if not Hammett's ideal hero, his most completely human hero\\". =The Great Depression, small-town morality, and \\"luck\\"= A more obvious theme in The Glass Key shows itself through the characters and their respective moralities. The novel is set in an unnamed city, a more unassuming place‚Äîa smaller, less sophisticated location‚Äîthan his previous novels. It is thus a locale more obviously open to corruption. Here are elected officials, community figures, and the like who participate in conspiracies of a type more often considered endemic to the underworld. Because of this, the characters openly display more animalistic qualities than in Hammett's previous novels. The characters, perhaps through the objectivity of the writing style, are portrayed as cutthroat and almost feral. One reason for their apparent slippage into violence is most likely related to the early onset of the Great Depression, as the novel was published in 1931.Hammett, Dashiell. The Glass Key. 3rd ed. N.p.: Vintage, 1989. Print. The loss of \\"luck,\\" as described in the novel (\\"What good am I if my luck‚Äôs gone?\\" He asks. \\"You might as well take your punishment and get it over with\\") is another deciding factor in the actions of the characters. The novel is similar in that respect to later Depression-era novels, such as The Postman Always Rings Twice. Writing style Hammett's distinctive and groundbreaking style helped usher in the hardboiled genre.Layman, Richard. \\"Chapter 17.\\" Shadow Man: The Life of Dashiell Hammett. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1981. 183. Print. The Glass Key, written in Hammett's later noir years, is a prime example of his stylistic power. Raymond Chandler, a 20th-century author and critic, discussed Hammett's sense of the modern world in The Glass Key: William Kennedy, also a 20th-century author and book critic, explained what is so complex about Hammett's writing style: \\"Hammett's strategy is to show the process of detection as motivated by and affecting a friendship between two men. Out of these materials Hammett creates a dynamic structure of uncertain, constantly shifting human relationships.\\" In The Glass Key, Hammett refuses to let the reader into the characters' minds. Perhaps Hammett felt all fiction should lack an inner monologue; in the real world people only understand actions and speech and that is all Hammett's characters give us. By keeping the readers in the dark of his characters true intentions, he intensifies our sense of the ambiguous nature of reality. That is to say, we never can trust if a character is doing what he is doing out of loyalty, or for selfish intentions. Reception There is general agreement that The Maltese Falcon and The Glass Key are Hammett's two finest books.Marling, William (1983). Dashiell Hammett. Boston: Twayne.Nolan, William F. (1969). Dashiell Hammett: A Casebook. Santa Barbara, California: McNally & Loftin. With the passing years Hammett looked more and more harshly on his own fiction but conceded that The Glass Key was \\"not so bad\\". Its reception was even better than that of the previous novel, and so were sales, 20,000 copies having been sold eighteen months after publication. Some preferred the Falcon, others said simply that Hammett had written the three best detective stories of all time, and in the New Yorker Dorothy Parker screamed that \\"there is entirely too little screaming about the work of Dashiell Hammett\\". Hammett felt that the finished book was his best work, nonetheless because \\"the clues were nicely placed... although nobody seemed to notice\\". Reviewers were less sanguine. David T. Bazelon, writing for Commentary, thought that Hammett had attempted a conventional novel, in which characters act for reasons of loyalty, passion or power. Even on those generous grounds, he found the novel unsatisfactory: \\"We never know whether [the] motive in solving the murder is loyalty, job-doing or love... this ambiguity reflects, I think, Hammett's difficulty in writing an unformularized novel-- one in which an analysis of motives is fundamental\\". Other critics wrote that the novel was \\"Hammett‚Äôs least satisfactory\\" and that the hero was \\"mechanical and his emotions were not there\\". Robert Edenbaum, for basically the same reasons, called The Glass Key Hammett's \\"least satisfactory novel... [in Hemingway] the mask is lifted every time the character is alone; he admits his misery to himself...exposes his inner life. The Hammett mask is never lifted; the Hammett character never lets you inside. Instead of the potential despair of Hemingway, Hammett gives you unimpaired control and machinelike efficiency\\". Louis Untermeyer wrote, \\"Hammett has done something extraordinarily new to the murder and mystery story. He has made the reader as much interested in the relation of his individuals to each other as in the solution of the story\\". Somerset Maugham saw in Ned Beaumont \\"a curious, intriguing character whom any novelist would have been proud to conceive\\" And Raymond Chandler found \\"an effect of movement, intrigue, cross-purposes, and the gradual elucidation of character, which is all the detective story has any right to be about anyway. All the rest is spillikins in the parlor\\". Legacy Dashiell Hammett and his novel The Glass Key have influenced many other hardboiled writers. Raymond Chandler wrote in his oft-cited essay \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\" that Hammett and other hardboiled writers created a style that removed the puzzle-game intrigues of typical detective novels and instead replaced it with realism: \\"Where murder is committed for reasons, and people talk and act as real people do\\". Chandler argued that it is due to these authors that this style is developed and raised from a generic form to a \\"new level of artistic substance\\". Together with Hammett's 1929 novel Red Harvest, The Glass Key provided inspiration for the Coen brothers' 1990 film Miller's Crossing.Patell, Cyrus R.K. (1994). \\"Screen Memory: Happy Birthday, Hammett\\". Harvard Review, no. 6 (Spring 1994), pp. 20‚Äì23.

The word 'Fling' means literally a movement in dancing. In John Jamieson's Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language, 1808, the Highland Fling was defined as 'one species of movement' in dancing, not as one particular movement. There is some speculation that the first solo Highland Fling dances simply showed off steps that individual dancers preferred in the Strathspey Reel, a social dance. This dance is now performed at dance competitions and events around the world. One goal of dancers today is to stay in the same spot throughout the dance. The Highland Fling is danced at almost all competition levels, from primary to premier. It is also performed for Highland and theory examinations. Dancers wear the standard kilt outfit to perform this dance. It is in time. A version of a Fling in a percussive dance style was remembered and danced by John Gillis in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, and those steps were written down in 1957 by Frank Rhodes. Each step was preceded by a travelling step in a circular pathway danced to the first part of the tune Sterling Castle, while the individual Fling steps were danced to the second part of the tune. The Highland Fling is referenced in the lyrics of Harlem hot jazz musician Harry Gibson's 1947 hit, \\"Who put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy's Ovaltine?\\" List of steps The dance can be done as a: * Four-step dance. Usually danced by primary, beginner, and novice dancers at competitions. * Six-step dance. Usually danced by intermediate and premier dancers at competitions. * Eight-step dance. Very rarely done at Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing (SOBHD) competitions, although it is still danced at some traditional Highland Games. The first and last steps must always be danced in those places, but the rest of the steps are up to the dancer to choose. For championships, the SOBHD will release a different order of steps for each year to be danced in championship competitions. Dancers taking theory exams may also need to know all of these steps, as well as their order, depending on the level of exam they reach.

Plain old telephone service For direct inward dialing service, the telephone company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the customer's PBX, and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the customer's PBX via the trunks. As calls are presented to the PBX, the dialed telephone number is signaled to the PBX with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization without the need for an operator or attendant. The service provides inbound telephone service for many telephone numbers requiring only a limited number of physical telecommunication circuits to satisfy the average concurrent usage by the customer. Traditionally, DID service used analog circuits. In these types of DID trunks the customer premises equipment provided signaling battery. The central office equipment detects the level of the line and disables service if the circuit is not operational. This is the reverse arrangement from standard plain old telephone service (POTS) lines for which the central office provides signaling and talk battery. Nowadays, it is far more common to deliver DID service on a Primary Rate Interface (PRI) circuit. The trunks for DID service are unidirectional, inbound to the customer PBX. However, the service may be combined with direct outward dialing (DOD) allowing PBX extensions direct outbound calling capability with identification of their DID telephone number. In the United States the feature was developed by AT&T; in the 1960s, patterned upon the earlier IKZ service of the Deutsche Bundespost in Germany. Use in fax services DID service is also used by fax servers. A telephone line is terminated at a telephone interface (fax modem) of a computer that runs fax server software. A set of digits of the assigned phone numbers are used to identify the recipient of the fax. This allows many recipients to have an individual fax number, even though there is only one fax machine available. Some voice over IP (VoIP) vendors have used one central, remotely located fax server as a means of offering Internet fax service to their clients. In theory, standards such as T.38 should have allowed VoIP subscribers to keep their existing fax equipment working locally; in practice, T.38 at the subscriber's site offers no benefit if the upstream provider is least-cost routing to gateways that do not support T.38 and cannot reliably send or receive fax/modem traffic. A fax server at a central location, connected directly to public switched telephone network (PSTN) T-carrier primary rate interface lines and using direct inward dial to identify the intended addressee can convert an incoming fax to an electronic document (such as .tif or .pdf) for web or e-mail delivery. The fax traffic never passes through the VoIP infrastructure as a dial-up modem call and therefore arrives reliably even if T.38 is not properly supported at some points in the network. Voice over IP DID service has similar relevance for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications.http://www.commpeak.com/wholesale-services/voice-origination/ To allow public switched telephone network (PSTN) users to directly reach users with VoIP phones, DID numbers are assigned to a communications gateway. The gateway connects the PSTN to the VoIP network, routing and translating calls between the two networks. Sellers In countries with multiple competing local providers, DID services can be purchased in bulk from a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC). For voice over IP resellers, some specialized CLECs (for local numbers) or interexchange carriers (for toll-free numbers) will deliver blocks of direct inward dial calls already converted to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or common VoIP formats. The individual VoIP provider need only obtain an inventory of local or freephone numbers from VoIP-aware carriers in various regions, import them in bulk to an IP PBX and issue them individually to end users. International DID numbers can be purchased in bulk from international providers. UK geographic DID numbers can often be obtained for free and can be terminated over SIP. A few US DIDs are available without monthly charges from vendors like IPKall (discontinued in 2016), but at the expense of the caller paying for a call to some expensive, rural location. The majority of vendors charge a nominal amount per number per month (as little as $1/month in small quantities) and then bill per-minute or per number of channels which can be simultaneously in use. For the caller, these numbers can be assigned to locations which are a local call. Direct outward dialing The corresponding service to DID for outgoing calls from a PBX to the central office exchange is called direct outward dialing (DOD) or Direct Dial Central Office (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The caller line identification (CLI) or caller-id of extensions for outgoing calls is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.

He is best known as the \\"Little Nemesis\\" of Laurel and Hardy. He appeared in nearly 50 films with them, making Hall the most frequent supporting actor in the comedy duo's productions. Life and career Hall was born in Ward End, Birmingham, Warwickshire, and learned carpentry as a trade; however, as a teenager, he became a member of the Fred Karno troupe of stage comedians. In his late teens, he visited his sister in New York City and stayed there, finding employment as a stagehand. While working behind the scenes, he met the comic actor Bobby Dunn and they became friends; Dunn convinced Hall to take a stab again at acting, which he did. By the mid-1920s, Hall was working for Hal Roach. Stan Laurel, one of Roach's comedy stars, was also a graduate of the Karno troupe. As an actor, Hall worked with such comedians as Buster Keaton and Charley Chase, but he is best remembered as a comic foil for Laurel and Hardy. He appeared in nearly 50 of their films, sometimes in bit parts, but often as a mean landlord or opponent in many of their memorable tit-for-tat sequences. Unlike the usual villains in Laurel and Hardy films, who were big and burly, Charlie Hall (billed as \\"Charley\\" Hall in the Roach comedies) was of short stature, standing 5 ft 5 in tall. His height and slight English accent allowed him to be convincingly cast as a college student, despite being 40 years old, in Laurel and Hardy's A Chump at Oxford. Hall almost never played starring roles; the exception was in 1941, when he was teamed with character comedian Frank Faylen by Monogram Pictures. Hall continued to play bits and supporting roles in short subjects and features through the 1940s and 1950s, occasionally on television, and appearing briefly in Charlie Chaplin's final American film, Limelight (1952). In 1956 he played his final roles, firstly in the TV show Cheyenne, season 1, episode 11, \\"Quicksand\\", and finally in a Joe McDoakes short, So You Want to Play the Piano. Death and legacy * Hall died in North Hollywood, California on 7 December 1959 and was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park.\\"California, County Birth and Death Records, 1800-1994\\", database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QGRK-82QQ : 27 September 2019), Charles Hall, 1959. * A J D Wetherspoon's public house in the Erdington suburb of Birmingham is named The Charlie Hall in tribute to him.

The transferred call is either announced or unannounced. If the transferred call is announced, the desired party/extension is notified of the impending transfer. This is typically done by putting the caller on hold and dialing the desired party/extension; they are then notified and, if they choose to accept the call, it is transferred over to them. Other terms commonly used for an announced transfer include \\"attended\\",\\"consult\\", \\"full- consult\\", \\"supervised\\" and \\"conference\\" transfer. On the other hand, an unannounced transfer is self-explanatory: it is transferred without notifying the desired party/extension of the impending call. It is simply transferred to their line by way of a \\"transfer\\" key on the operator's phone or by keying in a string of digits which achieves the same function. Other terms commonly used for an unannounced transfer include \\"unsupervised\\" and \\"blind\\". Unsupervised call transfer can be either warm or cold - depending on moment when B-leg is disconnected. See also Call forwarding In the Call Center space, the following type of call transfers can be undertaken and take on a slightly different meaning: * Warm transfer: (also known as a live or hot transfer) the call center operator dials a number and talks to the person who has picked up the call before transferring the caller over to them. This could also be a three- way conference before the call center operator drops-off. One common example of a warm transfer is when a receptionist or virtual receptionist takes a call for the business and notifies the party attempting to be reached who the person is and the nature of their call. * Tepid transfer: This involves the call center operator dialing a number and transferring the caller on to the called number without conferencing or speaking to the third party. Tepid transfer usually applies when a transfer is being made to a number where queue management has been implemented in some capacity (multiple lines or hunt groups, IVR, voicemail, callback facility etc.) * Cold transfer: This transfer is in reality not a transfer, but a pass-on of information for the caller to call a particular number after they hang up the current call. However, in certain instances a cold transfer may be implemented by calling the desired number on behalf of the caller, the original call handler/operator then drops- off without waiting for the called number to be picked up, whether or not the dialed number had queue management implemented or not.

Though the Polish insurrection in the Greater Poland Uprising of 1848 failed, many Poles had not lost sight of their longstanding dream of independence. To support the continuing revolutionary movements in Western Europe, Adam Mickiewicz outreached to the Polish community in Italy to form the Polish Legion which would serve the Italian initiative until the Austrians were completely driven out of the country. Though Mickiewicz was deeply influenced by Messianism, he believed this was a time when more than just spirituality was needed: it was a time for political action. The independence of Poland, Mickiewicz believed, started in Rome. On October 5, 1847, in a meeting of the Circle of God's Work, Mickiewicz announced, \\"The manifestation of the Christian spirit, the construction of the state for Christ, must originate in Rome, which is both church and state. Summoned to conquer for the spirit a state on earth, we must proceed on the earth, starting from Rome, which is our support.\\"Kridl, Manfred. Adm Mickiewicz: Poet of Poland. New York: Greenwood Press, Publishers, 1951. Hence, Mickiewicz and nine other compatriots traveled to Rome, where they summoned help for their mission. Mickiewicz had hoped to receive the support of Pope Pius IX, but many people rejected his proposals: even the majority of Poles living in Italy were unfavorable to the cause. Other opposers were the clergy because of his adherence to Messianism, and the aristocracy because of his strong social ideals and the threat to their wealth and power should Poland become independent again. On March 25, 1848, Mickiewicz pleaded with Pius IX for his moral support, but after several failed attempts, Mickiewicz proceeded independently to create the constitutional program of the Polish Legion. The manifesto \\"Sk≈Çad zasad, czyli Symbol polityczny Polski\\" (A collection of principles of a Political symbol of Poland) was composed by Mickiewicz for the legion and in fifteen short articles advocated freedom of conscience, equality of all citizens, equality of women, enfranchisement of peasants, solidarity and brotherhood of Slavic nations. The first struggle for the legion would be to remove Austria from Italy assisted by Slavic deserters of the Austrian Army. On May 1, Mickiewicz, now with eleven members, sent out to Milan where they were joined by a military detachment of Polish emigrants, led by Mikolaj Kaminski, to request the formation of the Polish Legion from the government of Lombardy. The agreement would make the Legion dependent on this government. Once granted, the company then appealed to expand the Polish Legion to 600 people, which the provisional government of Milan allowed as well. Though the Legion faced financial problems and a shortage of arms, it grew to 120 members by June. Mickiewicz continued to search for volunteers in Paris while the Legion, commanded by Kaminski, engaged in several battles. They fought alongside others in Lombardy and on barricades of Genoa against the royalists, in the defence of the Roman Republic. The legionnaires also tried to help the revolutionaries in Hungary but were dispersed in Greece. However, the Mickiewicz Legion had been finally defeated in 1849. About five hundred people had served in the legion throughout its short fifteen-month existence.Pekacz, Jolanta T. \\"Poles in European revolutions 1848-1849\\", Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions.

This has many of the advantages of a thin client strategy, but can be done on any operating system base as long as the boot device is large enough to accommodate the boot and applications together. A typical departmental Windows XP boot image is usually so large that it requires a DVD to store, and may be too large for network booting. Accordingly, it is usually installed on a fixed or removable hard drive kept inside the machine, rather than installed over a network or from a ROM. There are some boot image control complexity and total cost of operations advantages to using a departmental boot image instead of a common boot image for the entire organization, or a thin client: *all the capabilities of a full operating system are available, not just those of a thin client *applications with inflexible software licenses need not be paid for the entire organization, but can be paid only for the departments that actually use them and have them installed on their machines *applications that interact badly can be segmented so that an accounting program and an engineering program do not \\"clobber each other's libraries\\" or otherwise interfere as they would if both sets of applications were installed in one boot image *overall size of each boot image can be controlled to fit within network or removable disk limits Disadvantages include the complexity of creating and managing several large boot images, and determining when a department needs to upgrade its applications. If each user is allowed to do this on their own, then, the discipline soon degrades and the shop will be no easier to manage than one that consists of one-off computers with their own quirks, frequently requiring re-imaging and whose issues are not really diagnosable nor comparable to each other. Some experts believe that any departmental boot image regime degrades rather quickly to this state without extraordinary discipline and controls, and advocate thin clients to ensure such control. It is however increasingly possible to restrict users from installing \\"their own\\" applications on a standard boot image, and to automatically re-install when a variant boot image is detected. While this would be draconian in a large organization with one boot image it is often quite acceptable when the boot image is maintained at a departmental level and users can request that it be upgraded with a minimum of bureaucracy and waiting.

Opening Title  Ancient Proverb‚ÄîEvery married man should have his fling‚ÄîBut be careful not to get flung too far. Plot An old flame (Mae Busch) of businessman Titus Tillsbury (James Finlayson) threatens to expose their past, destroying both his marriage and career. He sends his aide (Stan Laurel) to keep her away from a dinner party he and his wife are hosting that evening. Production Love 'em and Weep was filmed in January 1927 and released June 12 of that year by Path√© Exchange. Cast Notes * Since Laurel and Hardy appear in the film, it is considered an early Laurel and Hardy film despite the fact that Hardy's role is a bit part and they barely share any scenes in the film. * The film was the first in which English character actor Charlie Hall was to appear with Laurel and Hardy. Remake Love 'em and Weep was remade in 1931 as Chickens Come Home, with both Mae Busch and Stan Laurel reprising their roles. James Finlayson played the butler this time, replacing Charlie Hall, with Oliver Hardy taking on Finlayson's original role.

Gameplay Gameplay screenshot The space bar and directional keys are used to create an easy \\"jump and move\\" motion. Up accelerates the ship and down slows down the ship. Meters at the bottom indicate the ship's speed, Oxygen Levels, and Fuel Levels. The meter to the left indicates the level progress, next to a grav-o-meter that describes the planet's gravity (100 is the lowest, giving a weightless feeling, and 1700 is the highest, allowing no jumping). The level is restarted if the ship is destroyed, runs out of fuel or oxygen or falls off the roads. Certain colors on the roads indicate special properties upon contact: *Dark Gray: Ship can't steer left or right. (Called \\"Slippery\\" in the game) *Dark Green: Ship decelerates quickly. (Called \\"Sticky\\" in the game) *Light Green: Ship accelerates quickly. (Called \\"Boost\\" in the game) *Light Red: Ship explodes. It is safe to be on the very edge of a light red square. (Called \\"Burning\\" in the game) *Blue: Refills oxygen and fuel. Several levels have hidden blue tiles that must be reached in order to complete the level. (Called \\"Supplies\\" in the game) The levels always end with a tunnel that ends into space, signifying a win. Legacy Following the success of the original Skyroads, Bluemoon released a Skyroads XMAS-Special version in 1994, which featured exactly the same interface and features, but different and considerably harder levels. Bluemoon made a simple non-interactive hardware demo to be bundled for the Texas VR gear company titled Stellar Xpress which effectively was a modern update to SkyRoads/Kosmonaut, but the project was cancelled.

California's public education system is huge (2007‚Äì2008): 6,275,469 students and 295,222 teachers in 9,846 schools, which are governed by 1,050 school boards and regulated by a complex Education Code. California schools vary in their grade-level configuration. Most elementary schools encompass K‚Äì5 or K‚Äì6, middle schools 6‚Äì8, junior high 7‚Äì8 or 7‚Äì9, and high schools 9‚Äì12. K‚Äì8 schools are becoming more popular again, even in larger districts. California school districts are of several varieties, usually a Unified district, which includes all of the Elementary and High Schools in the same geographic area; Elementary school districts, which includes K‚Äì6 or K‚Äì8 schools only, which may have several elementary districts within one high school district's geographic area; and High School Districts, which include one or more high schools in the same geographic area. Elementary districts sometimes includes the word Elementary within their names, but often do not. Sometimes the words Joint and/or Union are included in the district's name. A joint school district serves students from more than one county. A union elementary school district was formed as the result of a merger between two previous school districts, while a union high school district serves students from multiple elementary school districts. The typical district grade configurations in California are elementary (K‚Äì8), high (9‚Äì12), and unified (K‚Äì12), but there are some K‚Äì6 elementary districts and a handful of 7‚Äì12 high school districts. Districts sometimes merge or consolidate; the number of districts can change annually. In California there are 560 Elementary districts, 87 High School districts, 330 Unified districts. There are also 58 County Offices of Education, the California Education Authority School District (under the California Division of Juvenile Justice), 6 State Special Schools, and 8 State Board of Education charter schools, now classified as a \\"school district\\" since 2004‚Äì05.

He was appointed by George Tenet on March 16, 2001. The Executive Director is the third ranking position within the CIA and the incumbent functions essentially as the Chief Operating Officer of the Agency. For three years prior, Krongard had served as Counselor to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). A longtime consultant to DCIs, Krongard joined the Agency full-time in February 1998, following a 29-year business career. During his private sector career, he served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Alex. Brown & Sons, the nation's oldest investment banking firm, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Bankers Trust. Krongard graduated with honors from Princeton University with an A.B. in philosophy in 1958 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"The Nature and Meaning of Religious Propositions.\\" He then received a Juris Doctor degree with honors from the University of Maryland School of Law. While at Princeton, Krongard played lacrosse. In 1980, he was inducted as a member of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame. Krongard played for the storied amateur Mount Washington Lacrosse Club.Alvin B. Krongard Biography , National Lacrosse Hall of Fame, retrieved May 26, 2010. He served three years of active duty as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps. Krongard resigned from the CIA shortly after the arrival of DCI Porter Goss in September 2004. While at the CIA, he was the connection between Erik Prince of Blackwater Security Consulting and the CIA. Through his influence, Blackwater was able to receive its first black contract. On March 18, 2005, Krongard was appointed as an outside US director to the Global Board of Directors organized to oversee and coordinate the worldwide operations of DLA Piper, one of the world's largest law firms. Family Krongard is the brother of State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard. Krongard is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and resides in Baltimore, Maryland and McLean, Virginia. He was married to the late Patricia A. Lion and has three adult sons. Patrica Lion's sister, Margo Lion, is a Broadway theatre producer.

It may have been between Warwickshire and Worcestershire. Roman Britain At Metchley Park, near Harborne, there are the remains of two large 1st century Roman forts, it is believed that they were used as a base during the invasion of Britain and could have been used in the first north-western advance into Cheshire and Wales. Much of the site is now gone; the construction of the banks of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal resulted in part destruction of the southern extremity of the camp, including most of its fort. The most recent excavation took place in 1999 and it was established that the main fort probably housed a cohors equitata milliaria, this comprised a minimum mixed force of 1,000 men who were heavily armoured foot-soldiers with a complement of a lightly armed cavalry unit. In the 19th century people theorized that the camp was built by the ancient Britons (a theory supported by its being adjacent to the line of Ryknild Street) which runs through the area, others proposed that it was built by the Danes although no factual evidence supports this theory. Some few pieces of ancient weapons, such as swords and battle axes, and portions of bucklers have been found at the site. Excavations have uncovered Roman granaries, storehouses, barracks, a rampart with timber towers, a guard chamber, various smaller buildings, pottery and tools. These have dated the fort to a few years after the Romans first landed in Kent. It is now thought that the site was abandoned by the end of the 1st century. Roman discovery In June 2006 new Roman artefacts were discovered next to a McDonald's in Kings Norton. Local archaeologist Peter Osborn has suggested that there is a strong possibility that the battle between ancient Briton warrior queen Boadicea and the Romans took place in or around the area now called Birmingham sometime during 61 AD. \\"We know for certain that the battle between the 200,000 ancient Britons and the Romans happened somewhere in the Midlands.\\" \\"This spot is on the route to Metchley, the Roman fort in Birmingham and it's for this reason, if no other, that we think this could be where the battle took place\\". However Dr Simon Esmonde Cleary, an archaeology expert at the University of Birmingham, remains sceptical. Until recently suggestions for the battle field site range from Leicestershire to Warwickshire. The construction of new apartments has been put on hold until a full excavation is completed. 14th century There was no news this century 15th century 16th century: the Spanish Armada By the early 16th century Birmingham was already a centre of metal working for example when Henry VIII was making plans to invaded Scotland in 1523 Birmingham smithies supplied bulk orders for bodkin arrowheads for use by his army. In 1538 churchman John Leialand passed through the Midlands and wrote: The two main towns responsible for military weapons at this time were Birmingham and London, Henry VIII however did not look kindly on British made weapons and he turned to Italy for help in the manufacture of bronze cannons, he bought shells and bombs from the Dutch and much of the armoury and swords came from the more experienced Flemish. The majority of gunpowder was delivered from Antwerp until the threatened invasion by the Spanish in 1588. Howard of Effingham and Sir Francis Drake failed to capitalise on an initial victory over Philip II of Spain's fleet and allowed it to sail up the Channel due to low supplies of imported gunpowder, this proved the importance of more British arms manufacture as opposed to relying on imports. During the attempted invasion by the Spanish Armada, the nobility and gentry of Birmingham and adjoining counties, contributed large sums of money which are said to have been sufficient to hire and equip around 43 war ships. A 19th century book of the region's history describes a subscription of ¬£25 each from William Kinge and William Collmer (Colmore), of Burmingham; Richard Middlemore, Edgbaston; Mrs. Margarett Knowlys, Nuneaton; Gabriell Powltney, Knowle and Richard Corbett, Meryden, &c.; 17th century: the English Civil War By the early part of the 17th century Birmingham resembled a large sprawling smith's village. Aided by the abundance of nearby sources of coal and iron ore, many metal workers set up small foundries and workshops. Birmingham was an important manufacturing town with a reputation for producing small arms, and the village's trade stretched far and wide. In 1637 a London cutler protested against the import of 'Bromedgham blades' which were often made of similar standard but at a lower cost. Unlike nearby towns such as Tamworth, Dudley, Hartlebury, Wolverhampton, Coventry, Burton and Lichfield Birmingham had little or no military defences. In 1642 Web server down‚Äî2015-03-14 unrest between the Royalist (Worcestershire) and the Parliamentarians (Warwickshire) lead to many small battles and skirmishes taking place in the surrounding countryside. The allegiances around Birmingham were blurred with a mishmash of landowners, nobility and gentry all fighting for different sides. The Royalists first passed through Birmingham proper in great force in 1642, the town was mainly Puritan, and some looting took place. As an apology to the town King Charles ordered two of his captains to be hanged, this did not appease the town and some time later a baggage train of the king was captured and delivered to Warwick. With further unrest both sides prepared for war, the smiths of Birmingham were called upon and over 15,000 sword blades were manufactured, these were supplied to Parliamentarian forces only. Kings Norton and Hawksley both acted as battlefields during October, Prince Rupert's troops were ambushed with many casualties, although both sides claimed the upper hand (see Battle of Kings Norton). Front of a Parliamentarian pamphlet A True Relation of Prince Ruperts Barbarous Cruelty against the Towne of Brumingham. In March 1643 Prince Rupert in command of about 1,900 men requested entry to the unfortified town which was refused by about 200 towns folk and a company of Roundheads from the garrison at Lichfield under the command of Captain Richard Greaves. The Battle of Camp Hill started with a direct assault by the Cavaliers on the earthworks at Camp Hill, after being twice repulsed the Cavaliers captured the earthworks by launching flanking attack with their cavalry. The Cavaliers pursued the fleeing townsmen into Birmingham where they came under fire from some houses, which they torched. At the far end of the town at Cape Hill the Roundhead troopers charged and successfully checked the Cavaliers, killing their officer William, Earl of Denbigh, and allowing Graves and his men to retreat unmolested back to Lichfield. The laws of war at that time allowed for the burning of property in an undefended (unfortified) town of village if soldiers were shot at from those properties. Those houses from which shooting was thought to originate were set on fire by the Royalists, the inhabitants of whom were not allowed to quench the fires or to recover their movable possessions. About 80 houses were \\"burnt to ashes\\" (some of which belonged to Royalist sympathises), and some 15 men, and two women were killed, with many more wounded and left destitute. The Historian Trevor Royal writing in 2004 states \\"By laying waste to the town and setting fire to many of its houses, Rupert's force provided parliament with a propaganda coup ... Charles rebuked Rupert for his men's behaviour ‚Äî the prince had in fact done his best to curb his men ... but the damage was done: Birmingham had paid the price for supporting parliament and being seen to profit from it\\". Birmingham, continued to manufacture weapons of all kinds during this period and was heavily relied upon by Parliamentary armies for such wares. It remained on the borders between the largely Cavalier garrisoned Worcestershire and Roundhead garrisoned Warwickshire. Colonel Tinker Fox operated from Edgbaston House close to Birmingham and probably took place in the attack on Aston Hall on 28 December 1643, removing the main royalist base in the Birmingham. He and his garrison actively raided into Worcestershire during the First Civil War. Perhaps his most famous exploit was a commando style raid on Bewdley which resulted in the capture of Sir Thomas Lyttelton its governor. By the last quarter of the 17th century, the population of Birmingham was somewhere between 4,000 and 15,000. Birmingham's small arms manufacture continued and during the mid-to-late 17th century Birmingham smiths were renowned for their manufacture of quality weapons (Alexander Missen in his Travels on visiting Milan noted that \\"fine works of rock-crystal, swords, heads of canes, snuffboxes, and other fine works of steel\\" could be purchased in Milan but that \\"they can be had better and cheaper in Birmingham\\"). There is no evidence that firearms were manufactured in Birmingham until the 1690s when the Office of Ordinance issued a warrant to \\"pay John Smart for Thomas Hadley, and the rest of the Gunmakers of Birmingham, one debenture of four-score and sixteen pounds eight shillings, dated ye 14th of July 1690\\", but it is unlikely that guns were not manufactured in Birmingham before that date. It is more likely that when Sir Richard Newdigate approached manufacturers in the town in 1689 with the notion of supplying the British Government with small arms, it was important that they would need to be of high enough calibre to equal the small arms that were imported from abroad. After a successful trial order in 1692, the Government placed its first contract. On 5 January 1693 the \\"Officers of Ordnance\\" chose five local firearms manufacturers to initially produce 200 \\"snaphance musquets\\" per month over the period of one year, paying 17 shillings per musket, plus 3 shillings per hundredweight for delivery to London. 18th century Gun manufacture in Birmingham continued to develop, mainly around the Digbeth area but also in what was later to become known as the Gun Quarter. A meeting was held 5 October 1745, by the 6th Regiment of Foot for the raising of a regiment of volunteers to oppose The '45 Jacobite rebellion. The town contributed to a fund to repel the rumoured invasion by France in 1758. The 6th Regiment of Foot recruited in the county of Warwickshire in 1778 so successfully that it was called \\"The Warwickshire,\\" Birmingham supplying a large proportion of the men, and raising by public subscription ¬£2,000 towards their equipment. In August 1782 a corps was organised in 1782, but it must have disbanded soon afterwards. When, as an aid to recruiting, territorial links to infantry regiments were first established in 1782, the 6th became the 1st Warwickshire Regiment, reflecting their recent connections with the county. During the French Revolutionary Wars in 1794 in the West Indies, the 6th took part in the capture of Martinique, Guadeloupe and St Lucia from the French and in Casdebar in August 1798 they gained a Battle Honour. In 1798 when it seemed that revolution might break out two companies of cavalry and one of infantry were raised, each one 500 strong under the command of Captain Pearson and Lord Broke. They were called the Birmingham Loyal Association of Volunteers and held their first parade on Coleshill Street on 15 August 1797. The infantry were armed with muskets brought from Prussia. The Loyal Association held their first parade in Coleshill Street, 15 August 1797. On 4 June 1798, a grand review was held on Birmingham Heath (then unenclosed), \\"to the delight of the local belles, who knew not which the most to admire, the scarlet horse or the blue foot\\". Over 100,000 spectators were said to have been present. With the many gunmakers and workshops the quality of gun manufacture in the town needed to be controlled. Government viewing rooms were opened in Bagot Street in 1798, employing sixty or seventy people to ensure that guns produced were of the necessary standard to provide for the British army. Military use, however, was accompanied by a major market in the Atlantic slave trade. A 1788 Parliamentary report counted over 4,000 gun makers, with 100,000 guns a year going to slave traders. 19th century The Birmingham Volunteers had the honour of escorting Lord Nelson when, with Lady Hamilton, he visited the town in 1802. At a review on 2 August 1804, the regiment were presented with its colours, and for years the \\"Loyals\\" were the most popular men of the period. The Handsworth Volunteer Cavalry do not seem to have been more backward than the Birmingham Volunteers, though why it was necessary that the services of the Handsworth Cavalry should be required to charge and put to flight the rioters in Snow Hill on 29 May 1810 is not very clear. Duddeston Barracks were built in 1793, at a cost of ¬£13,000, as a consequence of the riots of the city in 1791. In 1809, a statue of Lord Nelson was opened in the Bull Ring, Web server down‚Äî2015-03-14 in memory of the men who died in the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Boulton struck a line medal in commemoration of the Battle of Trafalgar, and by permission of the Government gave one to every person who took part in the action; flag- officers and commanders receiving copies in gold, lieutenants, &c.;, in silver, and the men, bronze. Being struck for this purpose only, and not for sale, the medal is very scarce. The services of the Handsworth Volunteer Cavalry were required to charge and put to flight the rioters in Snow Hill on 29 May 1810. The Orsim bombs used in Paris, 15 January 1858, were made in the city. The official Natal Day could be argued as 14 December 1859, when a town's meeting was held \\"for the purpose of adopting such measures as might seem desirable for placing Birmingham in its proper position with regard to the great national rifle movement\\". The Hon. Charles Granville Scott had been previously selected by Lord Leigh (the Lord-Lieutenant of the County) as Colonel, Major Sanders had accepted the Captaincy, Mr. J.O. Mason been appointed Lieutenant, and 111 names entered on the roll of members of the 1st Company, but it was not until the above-named day that the movement really made progress, the Mayor (Mr. Thos. Lloyd), Sir John Ratcliff, Mr. A. Dixon, and Mr. J. Lloyd each then promising to equip his twenty men apiece, and sundry other gentlemen aiding to dress up others of the rank and file. The money thus being found the men were soon forthcoming too, the end of the year showing 320 names on the roll call, a number increased to 1,080 by the close of 1860. The latter year saw the first parade in Calthorpe Park, the opening of the range at Bournbrook, and the formation of the twelve companies forming the first battalion, but, notwithstanding many liberal donations (the gunmakers giving ¬£850), and the proceeds of the first annual ball, it closed with the corps being in debt by over ¬£1,000. On the formation of the 2nd county battalion, Col. Scott took command thereof, Major Sanders being promoted. He was followed by Lieut.-Col. Mason, on whose resignation, in February 1867, Major Ratcliff succeeded, the battalion being then 1,161 strong. Col. Ratcliff retired in June 1871, and was replaced by Major-General Hinde, C.B., who held command until his death, 1 March 1881. Major Gem who temporarily acted as commander, also died the following 4 November (1881), Major Burt filling the post until the appointment of Col. W. Swynfen Jervis. The first adjutant (appointed in 1860) was Captain McInnis, who retired in 1870, having received bodily injuries through being thrown from his horse; he was succeeded by Adjutant-Colonel Tarte. The first uniform of the corps was a grey tunic with green facings, and a peaked cap with cock's feathers; in 1863 this was changed for a green uniform with red facings, similar to that worn by the 60th Rifles, with the exception of a broad red stripe on the trousers. The trouser stripe was done away with in 1875, when also the cap and feathers gave place to the busby and glengarry, the latter in 1884 being exchanged for the regulation army helmet, and soon perhaps our boys will all be seen in scarlet like their brothers of the Staffordshire battalions. The annual balls did not become popular, the last taking place in 1864; bazaars were held 14‚Äì17 October 1863, and 24‚Äì27 October 1876; athletic displays had been given (the first in May 1865). At the Volunteer Review, 24 July 1861, before the Duke of Cambridge; at the Hyde Park Review, June 1865, before the Prince of Wales; at the Midland Counties' Review at Derby, June 1867; at the Royal Review at Windsor in 1868; and at every inspection since, the Birmingham corps has merited and received the highest praise for general smartness and efficiency; it was one of the crack corps of the kingdom. The first march-out of 720 to Sutton took place 21 June 1875, others joining at the camp, making over 800 being under canvas, 744 attending the review. The camping-out at Streetly Wood had annually recurred since that date; the first sham fight took place 20 June 1877. The \\"coming-of-age\\" was celebrated by a dinner at the Midland Hotel, 29 January 1881, up to which point the Government grants had amounted to ¬£26,568 14 s (¬£26,568.70), the local subscriptions to ¬£8,780, and the donations to ¬£1,956 1 s 3 d (¬£1,956.06) The Birmingham Rifle Corps is now recognised as the First Volunteer Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, having been linked to the \\"Saucy Sixth\\", under the army scheme of 1873. The Midland Rifle Club was started in 1875, the Staffordshire Rifle Association dating from 1861. Both clubs used the range at Sandwell Park, by permission of the Earl of Dartmouth. At the International Match at Creedmoor, New York, in 1881, the representatives of this neighbourhood scored high numbers, Corporal Bates (of the M.R.C.) taking the only first prize secured by visitors in the open competitions of the U.S. Associations. In 1881 The Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers were created drawing massively from the city's stock. The Royal Warwickshire Regiment reorganised as the county regiment of Warwickshire, encompassing also its Militia and Volunteer infantry. Around this time an official report showed that the Warwickshire regiment could muster 213 Yeomanry Cavalry on parade; while the Staffordshire had 422. 20th century =World War I= The Warwickshire regiment drew massively from the Birmingham area especially in the first world war, an initial recruitment drive in the city mustered over 8000 men to fight in British regiments. Due to the successful recruitment the government advertised again and subsequently recruited a further 4000 volunteers, initially named the 1st, 2nd and 3rd city battalion, they were later merged into The Royal Warwickshire Regiment. These forces later went on to fight in the trenches of the first world war. The Company's post-war programme included, for a short time, a range of aeroplanes. The Austin Greyhound 2 seater fighter was one, and the Austin Ball single seater another. Then there was a single seater biplane with folding wings, which sold at ¬£500, and a fourth called the Austin Whippet. Percussion caps were yearly sent from Brum in millions of grosses, the manufacture of the complete gun cartridge came later. The manufacture of the caps involved several dangerous processes, and Birmingham has had to mourn the loss of many of her children through accidents arising therefrom. The ammunition works of Messrs. Kynoch and Co., at Witton, covered over 20 acres (80,000 m¬≤), and gave employment to several hundred people, the contrariness of human nature being exemplified in the fact that the death-dealing articles were mainly manufactured by females, the future mothers or wives perchance of men to be laid low by the use of such things. The plant was capable of turning out 500,000 cartridges per day, as was done during the Turkish war, and it took 50 tons of rolled brass, 100 tons of lead, and 20 tons of gunpowder weekly to keep the factory fully going, all kinds of ammunition for rifles and machine guns being made on the premises. Other extensive works were those of the Birmingham Small Arms and Metal Co., at Adderley Park Mills, and the National Arms and Ammunition Co., at Small Heath, and Perry Barr. =Interwar= In 1936 the government purchased a site next to the Castle Bromwich Aerodrome which was developed into Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory. =World War II= 1 September 1939 - Approximately 75,000 Birmingham school children were evacuated to make way for the Battle of Britain. On 8 August 1940 the first air-raid on Birmingham took place over Erdington. During Birminghams 27 enemy air raids an official request by the Government to news editors not to publish such reports left the city's bereaved quite indignant and bitter. Over 2,000 women, children and elderly were killed and 3,000 more were seriously injured in the air raids, many of the attacks were aimed at the thousands of factories that manufactured weapons of war, including the Castle Bromwich aeroplane factory that mass-produced the Spitfire fighter aircraft. The longest raid took place on 11 December and lasted 13 hours, King George VI inspected damage the next day. Finally, 60 years after the end of the Second World War, a memorial is now in place by the new Bull Ring to commemorate the civilians who died during air raids, naming all those who were killed or gave up their lives protecting the city. B.S.A. and Longbridge turned their hands to the British war effort once again. =Post-war period= The Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers were absorbed in 1968 and were combined with the other 3 Fusilier Regiments (The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, The Lancashire Fusiliers and The Royal Fusiliers) to form the Royal Regiment Of Fusiliers. Selly Oak Hospital closed completely in 2012. All military personnel are now treated at the recently built Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham which is now the new home of the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, which cares for injured service men and women from conflict zones, as well as training Army, Navy and Air Force medical staff. HMS Daring, the first Type 45 destroyer is affiliated to the city of Birmingham.

He was president and chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. He was also an owner and chief executive officer of the Kansas City Royals. Early life The son of Marvin Glass and Myrtle Van Winkle, Glass was born on a farm in Oregon County, Missouri, and grew up in Mountain View, Missouri. He served in the United States Army from 1954 through 1956, then attended Southwest Missouri State College (now Missouri State University) in Springfield. Career with Walmart David Glass joined the company in 1976. In his position as Executive Vice President of Finance for Wal-Mart Stores, he administered the overall financial and accounting responsibilities of the company prior to his appointment as vice chairman and chief financial officer. He served in that role until 1984 when he was named president and Walmart‚Äôs chief operating officer. Along with Rob Walton, in 1985, Glass managed development of Retail Link program, Walmart's proprietary trend-forecasting software.Secrets ‚Äì always low prices In 1988, he was named Walmart's chief executive officer, stepping down from the position in January 2000. Glass was active in the company's growth from 123 stores in 1976 to its more than 4,000 nationally and internationally in 2005. Glass was named Retailer of the Year by members of the retail industry in 1986 and 1991 and was inducted into the Retail Hall of Fame in August 2000. Glass was also a member of the board of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. from 1976 until his death in 2020. Career with Kansas City Royals Glass became the interim CEO and chairman of the Royals on September 23, 1993, following the death of the founding owner, Ewing Kauffman.\\"Glass has full plate as new Royals owner\\", Kansas City Star, April 20, 2000 Under Glass' leadership, the board cut the payroll from $41 million to $19 million. During the Major League Baseball strike of 1994‚Äì1995, Glass opposed any settlement with the players' union without a salary cap, and supported the use of strike-breaking \\"replacement\\" players, despite a court ruling that the use of replacement players violated federal labor law. On April 18, 2000, Glass became sole owner of the Royals, purchasing the organization from the Kauffman estate for $96 million. The Royals board approved his offer despite a competing bid of $120 million by Miles Prentice. However, MLB rejected Prentice's offer because he did not have enough net worth to withstand substantial losses. With none of the area's wealthy families willing to even consider making a bid for the Royals‚Äîor any other existing or prospective professional team in Kansas City‚ÄîGlass was the only credible bidder who was interested in keeping the team in town. An original stipulation of the sale was that any profits from Glass' sale of the Royals must go to charity, but that clause has since expired. For much of his tenure as owner, Glass was criticized for bringing the same cost-cutting management style he used at Walmart to the Royals. While he garnered large profits, the Royals were barely competitive for most of the early part of the new millennium. Glass' management is cited for transforming the Royals from a perennial playoff contender in the 1970s and 1980s to one of the worst teams in Major League Baseball during the 1990s and early 2000s. Glass created a controversy on June 9, 2006, by revoking the press credentials of two reporters who had earlier asked pointed questions to Royals management. The move to avoid criticism infuriated many within the press and led to a backlash of articles that extended far beyond the Kansas City sports community. The Royals have had four winning seasons during his ownership: 2003, 2013, 2014 and 2015. In 2014, the Royals won 89 games and reached the 2014 Major League Baseball Playoffs for the first time in 29 years. They advanced to the World Series for the first time since 1985. The Royals finished the following year with the best regular-season record in the American League, and a second consecutive victory in its championship series. The Royals then defeated the New York Mets in 5 games to win its first World Series championship since 1985. In August 2019, Glass agreed to sell the team to Cleveland Indians vice chairman John Sherman, pending approval from Major League Baseball and its remaining owners. In November 2019, Glass officially sold the team to Sherman. Personal life Glass and his wife, Ruth, were the parents of three children, Dan, Don and Dayna, all of whom served on the Royals' board of directors. Glass died of complications from pneumonia in Bentonville, Arkansas, on January 9, 2020, at the age of 84. His death was announced on January 17. Glass Hall at Missouri State University, which houses business and management classes, is named after him.

Accessed Mar. 16, 2014. is a Bosnian comic book publisher, distributor, and rights agent, born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and currently based in Slovenia. He is the founder of Strip Art Features (SAF) in Sarajevo, as well as the magazine Strip Art of the former Yugoslavia. Rustemagiƒá (through Strip Art Features) represents artists such as Hermann Huppen, Bane Kerac, and Joe Kubert. His personal plight, documented by telefax during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the theme of the award-winning nonfiction graphic novel Fax from Sarajevo by Joe Kubert.  Biography  Rustemagiƒá founded Strip Art in 1971 at the age of 17, and founded Strip Art Features in 1972. Strip Art won the of Lucca Comics & Games as Best Foreign Comics Publisher in 1984. With the beginning of the Bosnian War in early 1992, Rustemagiƒá's home and the SAF offices in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilid≈æa were destroyed. More than 14,000 pieces of original art were lost in the flames, including pieces by Americans Hal Foster, Doug Wildey, Joe Kubert, Warren Tufts, Sergio Aragon√©s, George McManus, Alex Raymond, Charles M. Schulz, Mort Walker, John Prentice, Al Williamson, Gordon Bess, and Bud Sagendorf; works by Argentinean artists such as Alberto Breccia and Carlos Meglia; and pieces by European creators like Andr√© Franquin, Maurice Tillieux, Hermann, Martin Lodewijk, Philippe Bercovici, Giorgio Cavazzano, John Burns, and Ferdinando Tacconi. Rustemagiƒá was trapped in the war-torn city with his family, sheltering in an apartment building in Dobrinja. Some months later, in October 1992, the family moved locations to the Sarajevo Holiday Inn, at that point mostly occupied by foreign journalists and constantly under fire. Thanks to help from European publishers and artists, in late 1993 Rustemagiƒá gained journalist accreditation, enabling him to escape Bosnia and Herzegovina. After more than a month fruitlessly attempting to get his family out of the country, he was given Slovenian citizenship, which immediately transferred to his family. In September 1993 the family was reunited in Split, Croatia. This was the story told in Fax from Sarajevo. At some point during the siege, Rustemagiƒá's mother was killed when a hospital where she had been taken due to illness was captured by Serbian troops.Kubert, Joe.

Biography  D≈çsaku was one of the greatest Go players in history. He was born in the Iwami Province of Japan and studied Go in the Hon'inb≈ç school, becoming Meijin at a very young age. D≈çsaku was the fourth Hon'inb≈ç by the time he was 32, and the fourth Meijin by the time he was 33. He started to learn Go at 7. D≈çsaku was so strong by the time he was in his early 20s that even if someone played the first move, he would always win. Rumors were that he was two stones stronger than any other Go player. This was due to his deep thinking and next- level tactics. He laid the foundation for opening strategy in the Golden Period. Becoming Meijin by fiat Only a short time after receiving the Head of the Hon'inb≈ç school he was given the post of Meijin in recognition of his unrivaled strength. On one account, this controversial appointment (which deprived Yasui Sanchi of his official positions) was handled by the Jisha- bugy≈ç by summoning a meeting of all concerned parties, including the shogidokoro ≈åhashi S≈çkei. Sanchi did not attend, and the change of Meijin- godokoro was agreed on unanimously. The ground for this decision was the match of 20 games played between Hon'inb≈ç D≈çetsu and Sanchi, for which D≈çsaku probably acted as D≈çetsu's second on adjournments.All this as is in Go Monthly Review 1963/6 p.42. All the traditional stories are somewhat slanted, typically in favour of the Hon'inb≈ç side. Games By the time he was 32, he was already head of the Hon'inb≈ç school and placed at the top of the official hierarchy. It has been suggested that the true level of his playing strength was never really tested, given the distance between him and his nearest rivals. The evidence of his contributions is in the legacy of games, known to us by the kifu records. Two of his famous games are the Jan. 5th, 1684 defeat by one point in a two-stone game (his \\"life-time masterpiece\\") and the 1670 castle go game when his opponent opened at tengen, the central point, which was a victory. These were both against members of the Yasui house. Over 150 games of his are known. Theoretician D≈çsaku is also well remembered for his contributions to Go theory. He took advantage of overconcentration also known as korigatachi, making that henceforth one of the key theoretical errors that players avoided. Tewari analysis, a systematic if rather tricky tool of analysis of efficiency of sequences, is also attributed to him; as is the strategy of amashi. In playing Peichin Hamahika from the Ryukyu Islands, in 1682, he gave a practical demonstration of his theories, winning easily when giving a four-stone handicap. This game is a textbook piece and is still frequently cited. (The first game he won by 14; the second game on the same day was also recorded and he lost by a small margin, which may naturally mean that he had nothing to prove and was being diplomatic.) In the field of joseki, he innovated with the three-point low pincer, a more strategic play than the two-point low pincer favoured in particular by the players of the Yasui house. Pupils He taught Ogawa D≈çteki, Sayama Sakugen, Hoshiai Hasseki, Kumagaya Honseki, and Kuwabara D≈çsetsu.

Early life Trifko Grabe≈æ was born on in Pale, a small town in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. His father ƒêorƒëe Grabe≈æ was a Serbian Orthodox priest. At the age of seventeen, Grabe≈æ was expelled from school for striking one of his teachers. Grabe≈æ left home and moved to Belgrade, which was a part of the Kingdom of Serbia at the time. As well as continuing his education he joined the Black Hand secret society. For the next two years he spent most of his spare time with other nationalists who favoured a union between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Black Hand Grabe≈æ, Ciganoviƒá and Princip in Kalemegdan, May 1914. When it was announced that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the throne of Austro-Hungarian Empire, was going to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina in June 1914, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá, the chief of the Intelligence Department in the Serbian Army and head of the Black Hand, sent seven men, Grabe≈æ, Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá, Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá, Cvjetko Popoviƒá, Danilo Iliƒá, Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá and Gavrilo Princip to Sarajevo to assassinate him. Each man was given either a revolver or a bomb and a small vial of cyanide. They were instructed to commit suicide after Archduke Franz Ferdinand had been killed. It was important to Colonel Dimitrijeviƒá that the men did not have the opportunity to confess who had organised the assassination. Grabe≈æ, Nedjelko ƒåabrinoviƒá, and Gavrilo Princip, were all suffering from tuberculosis and knew they would not live long and the other four men hated Franz Ferdinand. They were therefore willing to give their life for what they believed was a great cause: Bosnia and Herzegovina achieving independence from Austro-Hungary. Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, the prime minister of Serbia, heard about the plot and gave instructions for Grabe≈æ, Princip and ƒåabrinoviƒá to be arrested when they attempted to leave the country. However, his orders were not implemented and they managed to reach Bosnia and Herzegovina where they joined forces with fellow conspirators, Vaso and Veljko ƒåubriloviƒá, Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá, Danilo Iliƒá and Cvijetko Popoviƒá. Sarajevo assassination On Sunday, 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and Sophie Duchess of Hohenberg arrived in Sarajevo by train. General Oskar Potiorek, Governor of the Austrian provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was waiting to take the royal party to the City Hall for the official reception. In the front car was Fehim ƒåurƒçiƒá, the Mayor of Sarajevo and Dr. Gerde, the city's Commissioner of Police. Franz Ferdinand and Sophie von Chotkovato were in the second car with Oskar Potiorek and Count von Harrach. The cars' top was rolled back in order to allow the crowds a good view of its occupants. The seven members of the Black Hand group also lined the route. They were spaced out along the Appel Quay, each one had been instructed to try to kill Franz Ferdinand when the royal car reached his position. The first conspirator on the route to see the royal car was Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá. Standing by the Austro-Hungarian Bank, Mehmedba≈°iƒá allowed the car to pass and failed to take action. Mehmedba≈°iƒá later said that a policeman was standing behind him and feared he would be arrested before he had a chance to throw his bomb. Nedjelko ƒåabrinoviƒá, the next man on the route, hurled his hand grenade at the archduke's car. The driver accelerated when he saw the object flying towards him and the grenade exploded under the wheel of the next car. Two of the occupants, Eric von Merizzi and Count Boos-Waldeck were seriously wounded. About a dozen spectators were also hit by bomb shrapnel. Later that day, Gavrilo Princip managed to kill both Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg. Princip and Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá were interrogated by the police. They kept to the promise to not tell anyone. Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá managed to escape to Serbia but Grabe≈æ, Popoviƒá and the ƒåubriloviƒá's were arrested and charged with treason and murder after Danilo Iliƒá told the police. The police went round and investigated random people in order to identify potential accomplices. Once they spoke to Iliƒá, he lost his nerve and spilled the beans. All seven of the men charged with treason and the murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand were convicted. Under Austro-Hungarian law, capital punishment could not be imposed on someone who was under the age of 20 when they had committed the crime. Grabe≈æ and most of the others therefore received the maximum penalty of twenty years in prison. Death Grabe≈æ died of tuberculosis on 21 October 1916, aged 21.

He is best known as the principal founder of the Cessna Aircraft Corporation. Biography =Early years= Cessna was born on December 5, 1879, in Hawthorne, in Montgomery County, Iowa, the son of Mary Vandora (Skates) and James William Cessna.https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=CE009 Cessna's family was of French and German ancestry. When he was two years old, his family moved to rural Rago in Kingman County, Kansas, along the Chikaskia River. During his boyhood he used his self-taught innovation and mechanical skills to improve farm machinery and to develop new farming methods. He later became a successful car dealer in Enid, Oklahoma. Cessna's interest in aviation began in 1910 after witnessing an aerial exhibition in his home state of Kansas. It was this exhibition that led him in future years to pursue his career in aviation. After realizing his interest in aviation, Cessna left Oklahoma and moved to New York State where he worked for a short period at the Queen Aeroplane Company where he first learned about the construction of aircraft. =First flight= Cessna Silverwing test flight in 1911 The Comet\\", an improved version of the Silverwing, circa 1916 In 1911, he set out to build his first airplane, an airplane he named \\"Silverwing\\". His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the \\"aero special\\", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of and 1,050 rpm. Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a ground loop, which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna got a glimpse of hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, \\"I'm going to fly this thing, then I'm going to set it afire and never have another thing to do with aeroplanes!\\". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a \\"daring hero\\" and nicknamed him the \\"Birdman of Enid\\". Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly over the next several months until December 1911, when he made a successful flight and a successful landing at the point of departure. He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland of the United States‚Äîbetween the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. =The middle years= The factory from 1917 After the success of the Silverwing, Cessna permanently quit his work with the automobile industry to pursue his interests in aviation. Between 1912 and 1915, Cessna developed several new monoplanes, all powered by an Anzani 6-cylinder with 40‚Äì60 hp. During this time, Clyde often flew his aircraft at holiday events and county fairs, an endeavour that at the time proved to be lucrative. Cessna circa 1917 It was in 1916 that Clyde acquired a vacant building to begin building a new aircraft for the 1917 aviation exhibition season. His factory served a dual purpose, as he also opened a flight school in which he enrolled five student pilots. However, in April 1917 when the United States declared war, the exhibition flying market ground to a halt. With his primary source of income grounded, Clyde returned to his old home near Rago, Kansas, where he resumed his duties on the family farm. = Travel Air Manufacturing Company = In the years following World War I public interest in private flying increased, leading Cessna in 1925, along with Walter Beech and Lloyd Stearman, to found the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita, Kansas. While Cessna was president, the company soon became one of the leading US aircraft manufacturers. This success can be attributed to Cessna's advanced design concepts, creating aircraft that attained international recognition, while establishing numerous speed and distance records. After two years, Cessna left the company with plans to start his own firm, due to disputes with his partners over the monoplane design or the biplane design. =Cessna Aircraft Corporation= A Cessna DC-6B On September 7, 1927, Cessna and aviation entrepreneur Victor Roos paired to form Cessna- Roos Aircraft. Roos resigned just one month into the partnership, selling back his interest to Cessna, and the company changed its name to Cessna Aircraft Corporation in December. In the later part of 1927, Cessna struggled to design and build an efficient monoplane. The AW was completed near the end of 1927. Cessna followed the AW with the CW-6, which flew in 1928, and the DC-6, which flew in 1929. He then collaborated with his son, Eldon, in designing and flying the CR-series racing aircraft. Despite the success of new models, the Great Depression led to a catastrophic decline in aircraft sales, a bankruptcy filing for the corporation, and the complete closure of the company in 1931. In 1934, Cessna reopened his Wichita plant, which he soon sold to his nephews‚Äîaeronautical engineer Dwane Wallace and his brother, attorney Dwight Wallace‚Äîin 1936. After turning over the Cessna Aircraft Corporation to his nephews, Dwane and Dwight Wallace, Cessna returned to a life of farming. Clyde operated an early diesel three-track tractor building ponds for local farmers. Upon Dwane's request, he agreed to participate in the company but served mostly in a ceremonial capacity and stayed out of the company's day-to-day business. He died on November 20, 1954, at the age of 74 in Wichita, Kansas. Legacy Cessna was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1978 and the International Air & Space Hall of Fame in 1983.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. . He was ranked number 27 on Flying magazine's list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation in 2013. The Kingman Airport ‚Äì Clyde Cessna Field in Kingman, Kansas is named in his honor.

These have several different styles, but with one detail in common‚Äî\\"County\\" is nowhere to be found in the district name. All independent districts operate within a single county, with the following exceptions: * Caverna, which serves two adjoining cities on separate sides of the boundary between Barren and Hart Counties * Corbin, which serves a single city divided between Whitley and Knox Counties. *There is some question as to whether the Fairview or Russell district overlaps into another county. An official map of the Fairview district, located in Boyd County, seems to indicate that it overlaps into a small area of Greenup County. However, the official map of the adjacent Russell district in Greenup County includes the aforementioned overlap, plus a small area within Boyd County. To see maps of these and other independent school districts in Kentucky, see this page at the Kentucky Department of Revenue. All county districts operate schools from kindergarten through 12th grade. Most independent districts also do so; however, a few do not operate high schools.

Family and early career  Riggs was born in Little Rock, Arkansas and joined the circus when he was five years old. His family performed in a variety of acts with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus where he learned comedy in the vaudeville style. He worked as a circus aerialist, comedy acrobat, and clown. Later, he formed a group that toured the country during winters when the circus was not operating. Audiences at shows put on by the troupe were often quite hostile toward the performers. After years of trying to appease the crowds with traditional performance styles, Riggs began to request input from them. As an example, he might ask \\"Who do you hate in this town?\\" If the audience replied, \\"the mayor,\\" the performers would quickly improvise a scene about the mayor. However, at the time, improvisation was a word primarily used to describe the actions of jazz musicians. Riggs was an admirer of jazz and avoided using the term himself, preferring the phrase \\"instant theater.\\" Later, a New York Times critic called Riggs' performances \\"word jazz,\\" while members of the Second City troupe visiting in the 1960s and 1970s referred to the shows as \\"spot improv.\\" One year, the booking agent for the troupe stated that he couldn't find anyplace willing to take the performers. In order to keep skills strong, Riggs rented a street-level space in New York City where group members could practice. People walking by could see what was going on by looking through the window, and passers-by soon began to offer money to watch rehearsals. Riggs began the Instant Theater Company in New York, which ran from 1954 to 1958. The famous critic Walter Kerr was an early attendee, and was amazed by what he saw. He held off writing a review for three weeks because he couldn't believe that the performers were actually taking in the audience's ideas‚ÄîKerr was convinced that group members were calling upon accomplices for input and were using pre-arranged material. After realizing the authenticity of performances, he wrote a glowing review. Brave New Workshop marquee  Brave New Workshop  Riggs' improv group began touring before eventually settling in Minneapolis in 1958. Here, Riggs founded the Cafe Espresso on East Hennepin Avenue, where he operated the first espresso machine in the state while also providing a home for Instant Theater Company. After the caf√© moved to South Hennepin Avenue in Uptown in 1965, claims of \\"the first espresso machine west of the Mississippi River\\" were also made. By 1961 the name was finally changed to Brave New Workshop. In 1971, Riggs opened the Experimental Theater Company (E.T.C.) in the Seven Corners area of Minneapolis, next to the University of Minnesota. This theater provided a wider range of material including comedy, variety shows, and specialty acts. A number of famous performers started at the Brave New Workshop, including regional natives Louie Anderson and Al Franken, and writers such as Pat Proft, television executive producer Linda Wallem, and scriptwriter and producer/director Peter Tolan. There was some sharing of experience and technique between BNW and Second City in Chicago. Del Close worked with Riggs for a time, and members of both troupes were regulars at each other's shows when traveling. After operating it for 39 years, Riggs sold the Brave New Workshop in 1997 to Mark Bergen, John Sweeney and Jenni Lilledahl, though Bergen eventually moved on to other projects. Sweeney and Lilledahl still operate the theater and have made some changes. Their focus is more on long- form improvisation, while Riggs had always been more focused on shorter individual sketches. In 2017, the University of Minnesota Press published Riggs's memoir Flying Funny: My Life Without a Net. The memoir focuses on his early life in the circus and vaudeville, and the early development of improv, since the books Brave New Workshop by Ron Hubbard and Promiscuous Comedy by Irv Letofsky covered some later developments. Death Riggs died in Minneapolis on September 22, 2020, aged 88.

It was Nikon's first DSLR aimed at the consumer market, and sold for US$899. It uses the Nikon F mount. The D50 was succeeded by the Nikon D40 in November 2006. Features It has a 23.7 mm by 15.6 mm DX format image sensor with 6.1 million effective pixels. It also has a 2.0\\" (50 mm) polysilicon TFT LCD with 130,000 pixels. The camera uses a through-the-lens full-aperture exposure metering system. It can simultaneously record NEF and JPEG data to a Secure Digital storage device. Like its newer, higher-end sibling (the D80), the D50 uses Secure Digital instead of CompactFlash cards found on previous Nikon digital SLRs. The camera is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery which is claimed to be able to take up to 2,000 shots on a single charge. The camera is compatible with PictBridge printers and can shoot 2.5 frames per second in continuous mode. The camera's dimensions are 133 mm in width, 102 mm in height, and 76 mm in depth. The D50 is the only entry-level Nikon DSLR to have the autofocus motor ('screw drive') built into the camera body, making the camera backwards- compatible with mechanical-drive autofocus lenses (Nikkor AF series) dating back to 1989. This feature has been eliminated on later entry-level models and is currently only available on mid-range and advanced models. This makes the D50 the lightest Nikon DSLR to have the autofocus motor. This camera has many settings that can only be accessed by selecting a detailed menu view. One such feature is the ability to make a series of differently-exposed images for processing into HDRI photographs. The camera menu refers to this setting as BKT (Bracketed Set). Market The D50 was announced on April 20, 2005 and went on sale in June 2005. When introduced, the camera carried a suggested retail price of US$799 for the body only or $899 with a new 18-55 mm F3.5-5.6 G AF-S DX lens. Another variant of the D50 kit containing both the 18-55 mm and a 55-200 mm F4-5.6 G AF-S DX lens was available. Competitors of the D50 included the Canon EOS 350D, the Pentax *ist DS, the Konica Minolta Dynax 5D, and the Olympus E-300. D50 body in silver. The website Digital Photography Review rated the D50 highly and noted its improved noise performance over the D70s it was largely derived from, although it had fewer hobbyist features (making the D50 the first de-specified entry-level DSLR camera thus lowering the MSRP) and a lower price than the D70s. In depth testing by the Images Resources website and the October 2005 \\"Hoshi Nabi\\" (Star Navigator) Magazine, indicated that the D50 achieved its low noise through exceptionally good performance at the sensor level. Testing by Roger Clark confirmed that the D50 had higher gain and lower noise than the D70. Tests of the D50 at all ISO levels indicated that it did offer low noise without loss of contrast or detail.

Biography Born in what is modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, he attended the State Teachers' College in Sarajevo and for a while taught at a school in Bosnia. In 1913, Iliƒá moved to Belgrade where he became a journalist and a member of the Black Hand secret society. Iliƒá returned to Sarajevo in 1914 where he worked as an editor of a local Serb newspaper. He became a member of Mlada Bosna (Young Bosnia).Edward R. Kantowicz. The rage of nations. Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA; Cambridge, England, UK: Eerdmans Publishing Co, 1999. Pp. 97. He recruited Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá, Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá, Trifko Grabe≈æ, Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá, and Cvjetko Popoviƒá to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, which led directly to World War I. He and Gavrilo Princip were close friends. On Sunday, 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and Sophie von Chotkow were assassinated by Gavrilo Princip. Princip and Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá were captured and interrogated by the police. They held out, but Iliƒá, who was picked up on a routine check, eventually broke down under pressure and named his fellow conspirators. Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá managed to escape to Serbia but Veljko ƒåubriloviƒá, Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá, Cvjetko Popoviƒá and Mi≈°ko Jovanoviƒá as well as Danilo Iliƒá were arrested and charged with treason and murder. ƒåabrinoviƒá, Iliƒá and Princip taken to court. Eight of the men charged with treason and the murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand were found guilty. Under Austria-Hungarian law, capital punishment could not be imposed on someone who was under the age of twenty when they had committed the crime. Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá, Gavrilo Princip and Trifko Grabe≈æ therefore received the maximum penalty of twenty years, whereas Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá got 16 years and Cvjetko Popoviƒá 13 years. Iliƒá, Veljko ƒåubrilovic and Mi≈°ko Jovanoviƒá, who helped the assassins kill the royal couple, were executed at the Sarajevo barracks on 3 February 1915.

It relates to various legal issues concerning transportation of cargo by road. It has been ratified by the majority of European states. As of September 2019, it has been ratified by 45 states. Based on the CMR, the International Road Transport Union (IRU) developed a standard CMR waybill. The CMR waybill is prepared in three languages. On the back is the text again in three languages. This aids the waybill in being accepted and recognised throughout Europe. Checked by customs and police, a transport document must be present when the shipment is transported. The document itself is not prescribed; there is a minimum of information required on the CMR. If hazardous substances are being shipped, some additional information is required, as described in ADR. This consignment is completed by the sender. The consignment should only be completed with a ballpoint pen, typewriter or computer. The driver who uses the consignment should be familiar with the consignment, and with the waybill, able to inform the recipient about the importance of the various topics on the waybill. As of the 27th of May 2008, according to an additional protocol to the CMR- convention, it is also possible to use an updated electronic consignment note ‚Äì eCMR. As of February 2017, several solutions are available. ITD, Trade association for the Danish road transport of goods has developed a solution; the eCMR waybill.

Claire Voyant is a medium who is murdered and becomes \\"Satan's ambassador\\" on Earth, killing evildoers in order to deliver their souls to her master. She first appears in Mystic Comics #4 (cover dated Aug. 1940), published by Marvel predecessor Timely Comics. Created by writer George Kapitan and artist Harry Sahle, she is unrelated to Marvel's later superspy character called Black Widow. Publication history The Black Widow makes five appearances during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of comic books, all five written by George Kapitan. These short comics stories (the longest is eight pages, the shortest five) are spread among three different Timely anthology titles over a three-year period from 1940 to 1943.The Black Widow at the Grand Comics Database. Madame Claire Voyant is introduced in Mystic Comics #4 as \\"the strangest, most terrifying character in action picture magazines ‚Äî the Black Widow. You've heard of the black widow spider ‚Äî that evil creature whose bite spells doom.

According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"The Black Widow can kill with a touch and has other, Satan- derived, plot device powers. The wrongdoers she goes after are ordinary humans, although one group of them call themselves Murder, Unlimited and another is the Cult of the Black Widow Spiders.\\" Her next appearance occurs 51 years later, in a flashback cameo in one panel of issue #1 (Jan. 1994) of the mini-series Marvels (\\"A Time of Marvels\\", written by Kurt Busiek with art by Alex Ross), and again eleven years later (Feb. 2005), also in brief flashback, in Marvel Knights Spider-Man #9 (\\"The Last Stand\\", written by Mark Millar with art by Terry and Rachel Dodson).The Black Widow at International Hero. The Black Widow returns, finally in full-length stories, albeit as part of an ensemble cast, beginning in 2008 in The Twelve (written by J. Michael Straczynski with art by Chris Weston). The character appears in all 12 issues of The Twelve, in addition to a one-shot titled The Twelve: Spearhead. Fictional character biography In 1940, Claire Voyant is a spirit medium who communicates with the dead through supernatural means. While serving a family named the Waglers, she is possessed by Satan to put a curse on them. James, a member of that family, survives a subsequent car crash provoked by the spell and, upon returning to Claire's quarters, guns her down. Voyant's soul goes to Hell, where Satan dresses her in her Black Widow costume. He also gives her the power to kill with a single touch of her fingers to the head (which leaves a branded \\"Black Widow mark\\") and other mystical tricks. Satan (who, daringly for the time, is discreetly depicted as nude but for his cape) sends her back to Earth to avenge her death. After killing her murderer, she returns to Satan who, no longer content to wait for evil souls to die a natural death and perhaps repent their sins in the interim, charges her with bringing those souls to him. \\"On the upper world are mortal creatures whose hearts are blackened with wickedness and corruption. You, the Black Widow, will bring their evil souls to me!\\" Additional WebCitation archive, retrieved August 21, 2010. She later kills corrupt arms manufacturers, crime boss Garvey Lang, members of a syndicate called Murder Unlimited and the villain Ogor, while also healing Ogor's victim. In Marvels, she is shown in flashback as part of a group of Timely's Golden Age characters aiding the Invaders against the Nazis.Busiek, Kurt; Ross, Alex (w); Ross, Alex (a). Marvels #1 Marvel Comics (New York). Modern incarnation In The Twelve, Claire Voyant is retconned as becoming the Black Widow in 1928 after her sister is murdered. Standing over her sister's grave, she wishes for the power to avenge herself against the killer, and Satan responds.The Twelve #7 Revived in the present day, along with 11 other heroes, after being in suspended animation since World War II, she recommences serving as an \\"instrument of vengeance\\" for an initially unidentified entity (though never actually referred to as Satan, the Black Widow's master is identified as \\"the devil\\" in later issues) and going on missions for that party.The Twelve #1-12 Personality A recurrent character trait of the Black Widow in her Golden Age appearances is that she shows no hesitation or mercy when it comes to killing her victims, and no apparent remorse over depriving them of their lives and sending their souls to Hell for eternal torment. Whether this ruthless aspect of her personality is original to Claire Voyant or a result of her resurrection by Satan as the Black Widow is unclear. (In her modern-day appearances in The Twelve she is much less a willing killer, and is shown crying after killing.) In Golden Age appearances she does possess great compassion for those she perceives as innocent victims of evil, and a willingness to use her powers to protect and even heal them. This is shown most clearly in her fifth and last Golden Age appearance, in All Select Comics #1, when she is sent by Satan to harvest the soul of Ogor, a charlatan faith healer who has been stealing money from those who come to him for cures. After confronting Ogor and causing his death ‚Äì he instantly dies of fright and heart failure rather than the Black Widow‚Äôs signature death touch, though the result is the same and his blackened soul goes instantly to Hell ‚Äì she then takes the time, and uses her powers, to regenerate the amputated leg of a young boy named Pepito, whom Ogor had promised to heal. Costume During her five brief appearances in the Golden Age, the Black Widow wears four distinctly different costumes, with different designs and different color schemes, and has three different hair colors. Appearing only in Mystic Comics #4, her first costume consists of a purple bodysuit with spider design on the belly, a green-and-blue striped cape, and red boots with yellow flame designs around the tops. For her second appearance in Mystic Comics #5, the red boots with yellow flame trim survive; however, the bodysuit becomes plain black with no spider design, and the color of her cape changes to solid red. In Mystic Comics #7 the color scheme and basic layout of the costume remain the same; however, the bodysuit acquires dark blue highlights, and the red cape now has flame designs around its hem. Both the \\"flames\\" and the cape itself are the same shade of red. Though highly similar to the costume in Mystic Comics #5, it is different in its particulars. The cape is held in place with a circular, gold-colored pin inset with a death‚Äôs head skull. Her hair remains blond for all three Mystic Comics appearances. In USA Comics #5, the costume changes radically. The outfit's colors are now red, white and blue. The costume itself consists of a bright red bodysuit, a cape (colored either white or blue depending on the panel in question) with upturned Peter Pan collar, and white buccaneer boots. Her hair is now pure white. For her final Golden Age appearance, in All Select Comics #1, the costume morphs into a blue bodysuit that, unlike any of her previous outfits, covers her legs as well as torso and arms, and a yellow cape. The boots with flame trim return, however both the boots and \\"flames\\" are yellow. The Black Widow is now a redhead. Throughout the majority of The Twelve she wears a fifth outfit, a minor redesign of the first, consisting of a dark purple bodysuit with, in a lighter shade of purple, a spider design on the belly. Her boots are the same dark purple as the bodysuit, with no \\"flames\\"; the cape is light purple, and likewise has no flame trim. In issue #12, the finale, she wears a sixth costume, which is gray, covers her entire body except head and hands, and features a fine spiderweb pattern over much of its surface. Historical significance Introduced in Mystic Comics #4 (Aug. 1940), the Black Widow is comic books' first costumed, superpowered female character. While John Giunta and Malcolm Kildale's Magician from Mars, who is superpowered, debuted earlier, in Amazing Man Comics #7 (Nov. 1939),Amazing Man Comics #7 at the Grand Comics Database. as did writer-artist Fletcher Hanks' Fantomah, who has a dual identity as well as superpowers, in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #1 (Feb. 1940),Fantomah, Mystery Woman of the Jungle at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

While The Woman In Red also predates her, debuting in Standard Comics' Thrilling Comics #2 (March 1940), that character has a distinctive costume but no superpowers.The Woman in Red in Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 9, 2012. Russell Stamm's Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character with the superpower of invisibility, debuted in a newspaper comic strip, rather than a comic book, on June 3, 1940. Powers and abilities Before her transformation into the Black Widow, Claire Voyant has undefined psychic powers enabling her to communicate with the spirits of the dead. Resurrected by Satan after her murder, the Black Widow has been granted supernatural powers allowing her to harvest the souls of evildoers for her master. She is able to teleport between Hell and the mortal world. Having already died, she is apparently immune to further attempts to kill her. In three separate Golden Age appearances, she is shot repeatedly and the bullets have no effect.Mystic Comics #s 5 and 7, USA Comics #5. She can mentally plant suggestions in the minds of others, possesses superhuman strength of an undefined nature, enhanced endurance, flight, invisibility, appearance alteration, and the ability to regenerate or heal others mystically. She also has a death touch power. When the Black Widow touches one of her victims on the forehead, there is a burst of flame, they are instantly struck dead and their soul is sent to Hell. At the same time a mark is left in the shape of a spider. In her modern appearances in The Twelve, she exhibits the ability to fly and superhuman strength sufficient to rip human bodies to pieces. Apparently she still possesses her death touch power; however, the only time she is shown attempting its use, it fails to work on a non-human target.The Twelve #10. Satan claims he has made her immortal.‚ÄùHah! Little do persons of evil know the plans I have for the immortal Black Widow!‚Äù ‚ÄìSatan, Mystic Comics #4. Within the context of The Twelve when Claire Voyant becomes the Black Widow in 1928 she appears to be in her mid-20s.The Twelve #7. When she goes into suspended animation, 17 years later, in 1945, she apparently has not aged at all.The Twelve #1. In this case, it seems the Prince of Lies may have told the truth.

The Oregon Department of Education has authority over public schools. Oregon has 188 public school districts. Types of districts Oregon's elementary and secondary school districts include unified, component elementary, union high and unified elementary districts. Unified districts serve students from kindergarten to twelfth grade, union high school districts serve students in seventh or ninth grades through twelfth grade who reside within the district's boundaries and have attended component elementary districts within the district's boundaries. Component elementary districts are financially responsible for educating students from kindergarten through the sixth or eighth grades. A component district is wholly within a single union high school district. Elementary, or unified elementary, districts operate the same programs as component districts but are also financially responsible for providing for their students' high school education. These districts do this through tuition arrangements with districts that have seventh or ninth through twelfth-grade programs. There is one union high school district, Harney County Union High School District, that serves a single school: Crane Union High School. The eight component elementary school districts are Crane, Diamond, Double O, Drewsey, Frenchglen, Pine Creek, Suntex and South Harney.

It is suggested that these lesions are caused by forces placed on the teeth during biting, eating, chewing and grinding; the enamel, especially at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), undergoes large amounts of stress, causing micro fractures and tooth tissue loss. Abfraction appears to be a modern condition, with examples of non-carious cervical lesions in the archaeological record typically caused by other factors.  Definition  Abfraction Abfraction is a form of non-carious tooth tissue loss that occurs along the gingival margin. In other words, abfraction is a mechanical loss of tooth structure that is not caused by tooth decay, located along the gum line. There is theoretical evidence to support the concept of abfraction, but little experimental evidence exists. The term abfraction was first published in 1991 in a journal article dedicated to distinguishing the lesion. The article was titled \\"Abfractions: A New Classification of Hard Tissue Lesions of Teeth\\" by John O. Grippo. This article introduced the definition of abfraction as a \\"pathologic loss of hard tissue tooth substance caused by bio mechanical loading forces\\". This article was the first to establish abfraction as a new form of lesion, differing from abrasion, attrition, and erosion. Tooth tissue is gradually weakened causing tissue loss through fracture and chipping or successively worn away leaving a non-carious lesion on the tooth surface. These lesions occur in both the dentine and enamel of the tooth. These lesions generally occur around the cervical areas of the dentition.  Signs and symptoms  Figure 1 Abfraction lesions will generally occur in the region on the tooth where the greatest tensile stress is located. In statements such as these there is no comment on whether the lesions occur above or below the CEJ. One theory suggests that the abfraction lesions will only form above the CEJ. However, it is assumed that the abfraction lesions will occur anywhere in the cervical areas of affected teeth. It is important to note that studies supporting this configuration of abfraction lesions also state that when there is more than one abnormally large tensile stress on a tooth two or more abfraction lesions can result on the one surface. When looking at abfraction lesions there are generally three shapes in which they appear, appearing as either wedge, saucer or mixed patterns. Wedge and saucer shaped lesions are the most common, whereas mixed lesions are less frequently identified in the oral cavity. In reference to figure 1, wedge shaped lesions have the sharpest internal line angles and saucer/mixed shaped lesions are either smooth internally, or a variety. Clinically, people with abfraction lesions can also present with tooth sensitivity in the associated areas. This occurs because as the abfration lesions appear, dentine/cementum is exposed. The dentine and cementum are less dense than tooth enamel and therefore more susceptible to sensation from thermal/mechanical sources.  Causes  As abfraction is still a controversial theory there are various ideas on what causes the lesions. Because of this controversy the true causes of abfraction also remain disputable.Antonelli JR, Hottel TL, Garcia-Godoy F. Abfraction Lesions ‚Äì Where do They Come From? A Review of the Literature. J Tenn Dent Assoc. 2013; 93(1):14-19 Researchers have proposed that abfraction is caused by forces on the tooth from the teeth touching together, occlusal forces, when chewing and swallowing. These lead to a concentration of stress and flexion at the area where the enamel and cementum meet (CEJ). This theoretical stress concentration and flexion over time causes the bonds in the enamel of the tooth to break down and either fracture or be worn away from other stressors such as erosion or abrasion. The people who initially proposed the theory of abfraction believe the occlusal forces alone cause the lesions without requiring the added abrasive components such as toothbrush and paste or erosion. If teeth come together in a non-ideal bite the researchers state that this would create further stress in areas on the teeth. Teeth that come together too soon or come under more load than they are designed for could lead to abfraction lesions. The impacts of restorations on the chewing surfaces of the teeth being the incorrect height has also been raised as another factor adding to the stress at the CEJ. Further research has shown that the normal occlusal forces from chewing and swallowing are not sufficient to cause the stress and flexion required to cause abfraction lesions. However, these studies have shown that the forces are sufficient in a person who grinds their teeth (bruxism). Several studies have suggested that it is more common among those who grind their teeth, as the forces are greater and of longer duration. Yet further studies have shown that these lesions do not always appear in people with bruxism and others without bruxism have these lesions. There are other researchers who would state that occlusal forces have nothing to do with the lesions along the CEJ and that it is the result of abrasion from toothbrush with toothpaste that causes these lesions. Being theoretical in nature there is more than one idea on how abfraction presents clinically in the mouth. One theory of its clinical features suggests that the lesions only form above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) (which is where the enamel and cementum meet on a tooth). If this is kept in mind, it serves as a platform for it to be distinguished from other non-carious lesions, such as tooth-brush abrasion.  Treatment  Treatment of abfraction lesions can be difficult due to the many possible causes. To provide the best treatment option the dental clinician must determine the level of activity and predict possible progression of the lesion. A No.12 scalpel is carefully used by the dental clinician to make a small indentation on the lesion, this is then closely monitored for changes. Loss of a scratch mark signifies that the lesion is active and progressing. It is usually recommended when an abfraction lesion is less than 1 millimeter, monitoring at regular intervals is a sufficient treatment option. If there are concerns around aesthetics or clinical consequences such as dentinal hypersensitivity, a dental restoration (white filling) may be a suitable treatment option. Aside from restoring the lesion, it is equally important to remove any other possible causative factors. Adjustments to the biting surfaces of the teeth alter the way the upper and lower teeth come together, this may assist by redirecting the occlusal load. The aim of this is to redirect the force of the load to the long axis of the tooth, therefore removing the stress on the lesion. This can also be achieved by altering the tooth surfaces such as cuspal inclines, reducing heavy contacts and removing premature contacts. If bruxism is a deemed a contributing factor an occlusal splint can be an effective treatment for eliminating the irregular forces placed on the tooth.  Controversy  Abfraction has been a controversial subject since its creation in 1991. This is due to the clinical presentation of the tooth loss, which often presents in a manner similar to that of abrasion or erosion. The major reasoning behind the controversy is the similarity of abfraction to other non carious lesions and the prevalence of multiple theories to potentially explain the lesion. One of the most prevalent theories is called \\"the theory of non-carious cervical lesions\\" which suggests that tooth flexion, occurring due to occlusion factors, impacts on the vulnerable area near the cementoenamel junction. This theory is not widely accepted among the professional community as it suggests that the only factor is occlusion. Many researchers argue that this is inaccurate as they contend that the abfraction lesion is a multifactorial (has many causative factors) lesion with other factors such as abrasion or erosion. This controversy around the causative factors, along with the recency of the lesion classification, are some of the reasons why many dental clinicians are looking at the lesion with some scepticism. More research is needed to fully clear up the controversy surrounding the abfraction lesion.  See also  * Tooth wear * Abrasion * Attrition * Bruxism * Erosion  References  * Summit, James B., J.

This is considered part of enterprise application integration in larger shops that use that term since applications are part of the boot image, and modify the boot image, in most desktop OS. Windows Vista includes tools for boot image control, displacing third party tools. Mac OS has always had more flexible handling of boot drives, simplifying control and reducing the need to move boot images around between drives. Increasingly, boot image control is a network operating system function.  Economics  Very often a large computer vendor is required to explain in a bid in response to an RFP how they intend to simplify the purchaser's boot image control problems and the attendant service costs: The total cost of ownership correlates strongly to the total number of different images, not the total number of computers, so this is a major cost concern. Three basic strategies are commonly advised: *a single base boot image for each type of computer in the organization, customized by each user with no central control *a thin client strategy where the smallest possible boot image is used, typically one that does not include a full operating system *a departmental boot image strategy where a base boot image is customized with applications to fit each group of users, but, the users do not have the ability to upgrade or alter the configurations  Thin client strategies  Organizations that do not closely track, control and set common standards for, acquisition of new computer hardware, typically can only practice a thin client strategy. Which strategy will reduce total cost of operations the most depends on several factors: * whether the capabilities of a full operating system are required, or just those of a thin client * whether applications with inflexible software licenses are in use that must be paid for not only if they are used, but even if they are only installed * whether poorly-behaved applications that interact badly are in use * LAN or removable disk limits that make it easy or difficult to do re-imaging on demand = More complex departmental boot images = While the departmental boot image strategy seems to be the most flexible, the complexity of creating and managing several large boot images, and determining when a department needs to upgrade its applications, can easily outweigh these. Especially if users object and try to subvert the discipline of waiting for a regular boot turn to upgrade all machines at once. If each user is allowed to do this on their own, then, the discipline soon degrades into effectively a bunch of home computer whose issues are not really diagnosable nor comparable to each other. In which situation thin clients may become the only practical answer: Many organizations use thin clients for applications which require high security, involve unreliable users or repurpose older machines for continued use. This much simplifies boot image control by facilitating centralized management of computers, and has many advantages: * since servers manage clients and the local environment is highly restricted (and often stateless), providing protection from malware, support costs are reduced * since no application data typically resides on the thin client (it is entirely rendered), it is securely stored on network drives upon its creation * since disk, application memory, and processors are minimal in thin client hardware, they go obsolete slowly and cost much less * since they are not as useful as ordinary computers they are of less interest to thieves While control of the images is simpler, there are disadvantages. Thin clients: * require more network bandwidth * require more host computer power and must typically be served by much larger host boxes * typically cannot run arbitrary Windows, Linux or Mac software * perform poorly in multimedia applications or games - an advantage in many business environments Many organizations try to gain the advantages of thin clients without the disadvantages by treating many very standard machines as if they were terminals, but with very much greater capabilities. As they buy new computers, they put the demanding applications on those.  Boot turns and re-imaging  Administrators perform a regular (often bi-annual) boot turn that re-images many older, off-spec machines at once so that new hardware can be deployed for higher-end use. This procedure is called cascading: the oldest hardware is repurposed with simpler software to let it continue in use for some less demanding or more access-controlled applications, but subjects it to much more rigorous control to minimize the number of images. The total cost of operations correlates strongly to the total number of different images, not the total number of computers. To minimize the number of images requires additional discipline: * Specify the computer hardware to minimize unneeded machine diversity and minimize the resultant number of boot images. * Upgrade new machine specifications at low additional cost so they remain useful longer, reduce the incursion of off-spec machines later in the life-cycle, improve standardization, reduce support costs, minimize e-waste with longer lifecycles * Organize the network so that boot images can be efficiently supported and swapped, independent of data. ** Data must not be dependent on boot devices - use networks to store data on secure servers so that data recovery is literally never required even in a disaster recovery situation * Confirm, by hardware acceptance testing on each new machine, that it runs the standard boot image ** Any machine that does not must be considered to be dead on arrival * A strict installation regime to ensure that only supportable standardized boot images are used and any machines that connect to the network for the first time with a nonstandard image are detected and rejected * Diagnostics and troubleshooting so that help desk and other technical support staff can employ standardized tests to identify the source of problems: boot, software, or hardware ** Ideally, backups on hand of the boot image, or even spare identical computers that can quickly be booted up from the boot device in question to determine if it is a hard disk, computer or software/image problem. * Common desktop system recovery tools and procedures for failed desktop units, typically using backup copies of a boot image created with utilities * Rapid network recovery procedures that replace a backup boot image in a few minutes or less, with considerable cost savings over using DVD, CD or floppy disk media which require human attention * Ensure computer accessibility features are on every departmental boot image that require them, or in the thin client hardware and software itself, to accommodate these users in a manner that is ubiquitous and cost effective. * Support telework and secure off-site system access procedures in the standard boot image ** Encourage teleworkers to buy identical machines to those in the office or use thin clients exclusively * Facilitate worker transfer by changing boots or authorizations instead of moving the actual computer * Install thin clients on all off-spec machines to eliminate the need for special boot images for them, and subsequent diagnostic problems and data risks.  Open configuration and semantic services  Desktop computing is increasingly relying on web services, making the thin client approach more viable. Departmental boot images may remain but simply instantiate part of a semantic service-oriented architecture, especially in larger organizations. A service component architecture would further simplify the implementation of control mechanisms, especially if a single application language like Java was used for all custom applications in the enterprise. More importantly, shift to software as a service by most large vendors means that applications are not tied to machines, so the number of variant boot images required (with the applications installed) is reduced. Other open configuration technologies such as Bitfrost, OpenID and even XMPP would also simplify configuration of boot images, as authentication would no longer be dealt with on the desktop/laptop device.  Vendor support  Large system vendors increasingly provide DVDs with the boot image standard for the machine as shipped to the customer, which usually includes tools to diagnose changes to the machine and download drivers.

Early life Mehmedba≈°iƒá was born in 1887 into a Bosniak family in Stolac, in the region of Herzegovina (at the time part of Austro-Hungarian Bosnia and Herzegovina). His father was impoverished, formerly part of the Ottoman Bosnian nobility. Mehmedba≈°iƒá worked as a carpenter., During a Muslim youth organization's trip to Belgrade, Mehmedba≈°iƒá befriended Mustafa Golubiƒá (another Muslim, also from Stolac) who influenced his revolutionary feelings. Mehmedba≈°iƒá, as did Mustafa Golubiƒá, identified as Serb Muslim. While working as a carpenter, Mehmedba≈°iƒá befriended Black Hand member Danilo Iliƒá, the main organizer of conspiracy against the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He joined the Young Bosnia revolutionary organization and became a colleague of its ideologue Vladimir Gaƒáinoviƒá, who was also a member of the Black Hand. As Mehmedba≈°iƒá held strong Serbian nationalist sentiment, and Iliƒá and Gaƒáinoviƒá saw a strong character in him, he was given delicate duties. He was sworn into the Black Hand by Provincial Director for Bosnia-Herzegovina Vladimir Gaƒáinoviƒá and Danilo Iliƒá. In 1912‚Äì13, Serbia fought in the Balkan Wars. Black Hand founding member Vojislav Tankosiƒá led a Chetnik detachment, in which many revolutionaries volunteered (including Golubiƒá). Young Bosnia =Potiorek assassination plot= In late 1913, Danilo Iliƒá recommended the end of revolutionary organization building and a move to direct action against Austria-Hungary when meeting a Serbian captain and fellow Black Hand member in U≈æice. Iliƒá then met with Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá \\"Apis\\", the leader of the Black Hand, to discuss the matter. Apis' right hand, Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosiƒá, called an action planning meeting in Toulouse, France. On Orthodox New Year, Golubiƒá called Mehmedba≈°iƒá, who was in Stolac, to immediately come to the meeting in Toulouse. During this January 1914 meeting, various possible Austro-Hungarian targets for assassination were discussed, including Franz Ferdinand. However, it was decided only to kill the Governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek. The assassination plot was organized in Toulouse by Gaƒáinoviƒá and Golubiƒá. Mehmedba≈°iƒá was chosen for the task. He had left Stolac with 300 krone borrowed to finance the plot. Mehmedba≈°iƒá was (according to himself) \\"eager to carry out an act of terrorism to revive the revolutionary spirit of Bosnia.\\" He was given a Swedish knife containing poison. Mehmedba≈°iƒá arrived at Dubrovnik by steamship, and then travelled by train. At the Hum train station, on the way to Sarajevo, gendarmes searched the train; fearing they were on to him, he threw the knife out the window. Potiorek was planned to be assassinated at the end of March 1914, when the new mufti ƒåau≈°eviƒá was to be enthroned in Sarajevo. However, upon hearing that Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria would come to Sarajevo on Vidovdan, the Black Hand changed their minds. The Archduke's scheduled visit on Vidovdan (28 June), a Serbian national holiday, was perceived as an insult. Iliƒá summoned Mehmedba≈°iƒá and informed him on 26 March that the plan now was to murder Archduke Franz Ferdinand, as ordered by Apis, and Mehmedba≈°iƒá should stand by for the new operation. Mehmedba≈°iƒá said during talks of the assassination that \\"half of Bosnia and Herzegovina will join the plot, and the other half will approve everything we do\\". =Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand= Apis and fellow conspirators Milan Ciganoviƒá and Major Tankosiƒá hired three youngsters, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá and Trifko Grabe≈æ to carry out the assassination. Gavrilo Princip stayed in Sarajevo with Danilo Iliƒá, who hired three more as a backup team, Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá, Cvjetko Popoviƒá and Mehmedba≈°iƒá. On 28 June, a Sunday, a motorcade took the royal party to the City Hall for the official reception. Security was light; the Archduke objected to heavy security and soldiers between him and the people. 120 police officers were on crowd duty. The group of six assassins were positioned along the route, the Appel Quay. The first opportunity came to Mehmedba≈°iƒá, who stood by the Austro-Hungarian Bank, but he lost his nerve (later claiming that a policeman stood near and would have intervened if he took his grenade) and watched the motorcade pass. Likewise, the second, ƒåubriloviƒá, did not act. The next, ƒåabrinoviƒá, threw his bomb which bounced off the royal car and exploded under the following car, wounding two in the car and twenty in the crowd, then failed at suicide as his cyanide did not work and was arrested. Princip, hearing the explosion, believed the assassination to be a success and went to a nearby caf√©. The motorcade made it safely to the Hall, and speeches were held, in which Franz Ferdinand was concerned about the injured and insisted on visiting them at the hospital, advised against by von Morsey but supported by Potiorek. As the motorcade took a wrong route to the hospital, it found itself outside the caf√© where Princip was at; he fired fatal shots at the royal couple and then turned the gun at himself, however, two bystanders stopped him and he was arrested. ƒåabrinoviƒá and Princip gave up the names of their fellow conspirators under torture. Mehmedba≈°iƒá managed to escape (wearing civilian clothes and a fez) to Montenegro, arriving on 4 July, but Danilo Iliƒá, Veljko ƒåubriloviƒá, Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá, Cvjetko Popoviƒá and Mi≈°ko Jovanoviƒá were arrested and charged with treason and murder. Upon learning that Mehmedba≈°iƒá was in Nik≈°iƒá, the Austro-Hungarian authorities urged the Montenegrin authorities to have him arrested and handed over to them. Jovan Plamenac said that the Montenegrin government gave strict orders to capture Mehmedba≈°iƒá, but informed the Austro-Hungarian diplomacy that the Montenegrin government had no intention to hand him over if they captured him, and that instead a Montenegrin court would judge him. On 12 July, Mehmedba≈°iƒá was apprehended by the Montenegrin authorities. However, before he was extradited he escaped from the Nik≈°iƒá prison two days later. It has been claimed that the Montenegrin government hid him and had him sent over the ƒåakor mountain into Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian authorities suspected Montenegrin collusion in his escape and arrested the gendarmes who guarded Mehmedba≈°iƒá. During his captivity Mehmedba≈°iƒá admitted his complicity in the assassination. World War I In Serbia, Mehmedba≈°iƒá met up with Mustafa Golubiƒá, with whom he joined the Chetnik detachment of Vojislav Tankosiƒá that fought in World War I. He trained Bosnian volunteers. Mehmedba≈°iƒá met with Apis on several occasions. Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá while imprisoned in Thessaloniki during the Serbian court-martial in 1917. Mehmedba≈°iƒá was accused of having participated in an alleged plot to kill Serbian regent Alexander in 1916. For some time, Regent Alexander and officers loyal to him had planned to get rid of the military clique headed by Apis who represented a political threat to Alexander's power. The Austro- Hungarian peace demand gave added impetus to this plan. On 15 March 1917 Apis and the officers loyal to him were indicted, on various false charges by Serbian Court Martial on the French-controlled Salonika front (known in Serbo- Croatian as '). On 23 May Apis and eight of his associates were sentenced to death; two others (one was Mehmedba≈°iƒá) were sentenced to 15 years in prison. Charges were eventually reduced, leaving three death sentences in place. Among those tried, Apis, Ljubomir Vuloviƒá, Rade Malobabiƒá and Mehmedba≈°iƒá confessed their roles in Sarajevo. During the trial, Mehmedba≈°iƒá said that \\"I saw in Serbia with my eyes as the Piedmont of Serbdom, I couldn't see anything else...\\" and that his idol was \\"the national guslar (poet) singing Serbian songs\\". It was later found that Mehmedba≈°iƒá had in fact proved the trial false. Serbia's Supreme Court retried the case and all defendants were exonerated (rehabilitated) in 1953. He survived the war and arrival of the Serbian army in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the \\"happiest day in his life\\". Mehmedba≈°iƒá was commuted and released in 1919. Interwar period and death Street of Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá in Banja Luka. After World War I, Mehmedba≈°iƒá returned to Sarajevo and in 1919 was pardoned. Mehmedba≈°iƒá was killed during World War II by the Usta≈°e on 29 May 1943. He was buried in the Butmir district of Sarajevo, on the outskirts of the city.Mu≈°eta-A≈°ƒçeriƒá, Vesna (1989).

Geographical school districts in Texas are (with one exception, the Stafford Municipal School District) completely independent from city or county jurisdiction. Texas school district boundaries are not always aligned with county or city boundaries; a district can occupy several counties and cities, while a single city (especially larger ones such as Dallas, Houston, or San Antonio) may be split between several districts. Almost all Texas school districts use the title \\"Independent School District\\", or ISD. Except for Stafford, those few districts that do not have \\"ISD\\" in their names are nonetheless ISDs. This list does not include: *Juvenile prison schools run by the Texas Juvenile Justice Department (formerly by the Texas Youth Commission) *Schools and school systems without campuses or local taxing districts, such as the Texas Tech University Independent School District *Public charter schools It does include Independent School Districts run by orphanages. However, there were only two known examples, the Masonic Home Independent School District (which closed in 2005 and is listed with the other defunct school districts below the main list) and the Boles Independent School District (which later expanded to serve homes in the nearby area). All districts come under the jurisdiction of the Texas Education Agency (TEA). Extracurricular activities involving competitions between schools typically come under the jurisdiction of the University Interscholastic League (UIL), which is not part of TEA. your bitcoinA * Abbott

assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Early life and assassination He was born in what is modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was an 18-year-old student, studying in Sarajevo when Danilo Iliƒá recruited him and his friend, Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá to help assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, the prime minister of the Kingdom of Serbia, heard about the plot and gave instructions for the three men to be arrested. However, his orders were not implemented and the three men arrived in Bosnia and Herzegovina where they joined forces with fellow conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, Mi≈°ko Jovanoviƒá and Vaso's brother Veljko ƒåubriloviƒá. On Sunday, 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and Sophie von Chotek were assassinated by Gavrilo Princip. Princip and Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá were captured and interrogated by the police. They eventually gave the names of their fellow conspirators. Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá managed to escape to Serbia but Popoviƒá, Iliƒá, Jovanoviƒá, and the ƒåubriloviƒá brothers were arrested and charged with treason and murder. All the men were found guilty. Under Austro- Hungarian law, an offender under the age of 20 could not be executed. Nedjelko ƒåabrinoviƒá, Gavrilo Princip and Trifko Grabe≈æ therefore received the maximum penalty of twenty years, whereas Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá were sentenced to 16 years and Popoviƒá to 13 years prison at Terez√≠n. Popoviƒá was released when the Allies defeated the Central Powers in November 1918, having served 4 years of his 13-year sentence. Later life After his release from prison at the end of World War I, Popoviƒá returned to teaching as a professor of philosophy and eventually became Curator of the Ethnographic Department of the Sarajevo Museum. The night before the 50th anniversary of the killing of the Archduke in 1964, Popoviƒá attended a lecture about the assassination in Sarajevo, but did not attend any of the events throughout the city, commemorating the anniversary. He was quoted as saying that he would not have taken part in the assassination had he known it would lead to war. Marking the 55th anniversary of the event in June 1969, Popoviƒá, then aged 73, gave an interview recalling the assassination. Cvjetko Popoviƒá died in Sarajevo on 9 June 1980 at the age of 84, leaving Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá as the sole surviving assassin. ƒåubriloviƒá died 10 years and 2 days later on 11 June 1990 at age 93.

Over the years, multiple bands have cited grievances, conflicts, or filed lawsuits against the record label, while others have stayed with record label for years, or even came back to Victory after releasing albums on different labels. Former Victory band Thursday has had a conflict with the label, citing issues with royalties. The band also cited an incident involving the Victory Records marketing staff producing whoopie cushions for the promotion of their 2001 album Full Collapse, against their wishes. Thursday stated in the DVD accompanying their compilation album Kill the House Lights that they chose to go to a major label (Island Def Jam in 2002) and after fulfilling their contract, Tony Brummel and Victory Records welcomed Thursday \\"back with open arms.\\" On July 12, 2015, Wil Francis of Horror Punk band Aiden posted on their official Facebook that they sold 500,000 albums total through Victory Records and were not paid. Despite the controversy, relations between Victory Records and its bands have not been all negative. Close Your Eyes and Ill Ni√±o have mentioned positive relations multiple times in interview. Emmure has said specifically \\"Victory does good business, and if you‚Äôre a band that is expecting more than what you get, then you‚Äôre going to feel cheated and robbed.\\" = Hawthorne Heights lawsuit = On August 7, 2006, the Victory-signed band Hawthorne Heights announced in a \\"manifesto\\" on their website that they were leaving the labelThe REAL Manifesto, Hawthorne Heights, 2006 and filed a lawsuit accusing Victory of fraudulent accounting practices and for \\"severely damag[ing] the band's reputation and relationship with their fans.\\" Brummel allegedly issued public statements in the band's name criticizing hip-hop and singer Ne-Yo (whose CD In My Own Words was Hawthorne Heights' most prominent competition on the Billboard 200 charts), as well as urging street team members to conceal copies of Ne-Yo's CD in record stores. On September 13, 2006, Victory records countersued Hawthorne Heights, accusing the band of breach of contract and libel. In October 2006, a Chicago judge dismissed two of the three main claims in the band's suit, ruling that the trademark and copyright violation allegations were unfounded. On March 5, 2007 a federal judge in Chicago ruled that Victory Records does not hold exclusive rights for the band's recording services and that the band can record for any label. Specifically, the judge stated: \\"The agreement contains no exclusivity provision, nor does any of its language appear to prevent [the band] from recording elsewhere during the life of the agreement\\". The judge later reaffirmed this ruling on May 17, 2007, stating that Hawthorne Heights is still contractually bound to deliver two albums to Victory, but may record albums which are released elsewhere. In January 2008, Victory filed a lawsuit against Virgin/EMI Records alleging that \\"Virgin/EMI improperly induced platinum-selling band Hawthorne Heights to repudiate its contract with top independent label Victory Records\\", including allegations that Virgin/EMI funded the initial phase of Hawthorne Heights' lawsuit against Victory. The suit sought actual damages of $10M and punitive damages of $25M. = A Day to Remember lawsuit = On December 15, 2011, it was announced that A Day to Remember planned on filing a civil action against the label for breach of contract. Legal action was reportedly initiated on May 31 of that year, in which the band claimed that Victory owed them over $75,000 in royalties. Victory Records has said, on their behalf, that the lawsuit is actually about the band's refusal to fulfill their five-album contractual commitment to Victory and their newfound desire to move to a major label. On October 5, 2013, news outlets reported that A Day to Remember had been given permission to self-release their new album Common Courtesy without any involvement from Victory. The album was released digitally on October 8, 2013. Victory and the band released statements in response to the court ruling. On November 26, 2016, A Day to Remember won the lawsuit against Victory Records. The band was given $4.02 million dollars and won three of the four issues they were suing Victory for fulfilling the bands contract, controlling the band's publishing, and digital royalty withheld from the band. Victory won the band's master recordings. =Design the Skyline criticism= Beginning in May 2011, the label was widely criticized for signing groups perceived as inferior to many of the bands they signed in the past. Some bloggers called Design the Skyline \\"the worst band ever.\\" Although Victory refused to comment on the signing, they continued to promote the band regardless of the criticism. The band however, did comment on their controversy, stating; \\"We really don‚Äôt mind. We can honestly see why people give us negative feedback for one, the way we look and the fact that we got signed to a mainly hardcore metal label with just one song; we stick out like a sore thumb. And not to mention how young we are.\\" = Streetlight Manifesto lawsuit = Ska-punk group Streetlight Manifesto has had numerous conflicts and has a generally poor relationship with Victory Records. The band left the label after their album The Hands That Thieve. In February 2012, Streetlight Manifesto went so far as to request that their fans boycott their (Streetlight Manifesto's) music and other items from the Victory record label's online store. On October 20, 2015, media outlets reported of a $1,000,000 lawsuit filed by Victory Records against lead vocalist Tomas Kalnoky. The lawsuit was filed in regard to the band not fulfilling their record deal of four studio albums to be released under Victory. The band released five albums while on the label, however Victory claims that \\"... the band agreed not to count this album as one of the four albums under its contract to receive a $10,000 emergency advance.\\" Victory also claims that the band's album 99 Songs of Revolution: Vol. 1 does not count towards the contract due to it being a covers album. The lawsuit claims the $1,000,000 is to be paid for Streetlight not fulfilling their 4 album record deal, as well as damages for copyright infringement relating to the release of their last album The Hands That Thieve in which Tomas Kalnoky released an acoustic version of the album under his pseudonym Toh Kay titled \\"The Hand That Thieves\\". The Toh Kay release was officially cancelled, however the release was later made available online. On April 19, 2017, the band announced on their social media pages that a settlement had been reached with Victory Records. As part of the settlement, Victory Records sold all Streetlight Manifesto master tapes back to the band.

He was twice elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as a Scottish Representative peer, serving once from 14 January 1833 to 29 December 1834 and then again from 8 September 1847 to 23 April 1859. His political career also included the governorships of Madras and of Bombay. Life The only son of John Elphinstone, 12th Lord Elphinstone in the peerage of Scotland, he was born on 23 June 1807. He succeeded his father as Lord Elphinstone in May 1813, and entered the army in 1826 as a cornet in the Royal Horse Guards. He was promoted lieutenant in 1828, and captain in 1832, and was a lord in waiting to William IV from 1835 to 1837. The king made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1836, in which year he was sworn of the privy council. In 1837, he left the Guards on being appointed governor of Madras by Lord Melbourne; it was said at the time that his appointment was made in order to dissipate a rumour that the young Queen Victoria had fallen in love with him.See: Perry, Roland, The Queen, Her Lover and the Most Notorious Spy in History: The Intriguing True Story of Queen Victoria's Secret, Allen & Unwin, (Crows Nest), 2014. He was governor of Madras from 1837 to 1842; he built a house at K√°iti, in the Nilgiri Hills. On resigning his governorship in 1842 he travelled for some years, and explored Kashmir. He returned to England in 1845, and in 1847 was appointed by Lord John Russell to be a lord in waiting to the queen, an office which he held until 1852, and again under Lord Aberdeen's administration from January to October 1853, when he was appointed governor of Bombay. During this governorship the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out. Elphinstone checked the rising at a few places in his presidency, and put down the insurrection of the Rajah of Sholapur. He discovered a conspiracy in Bombay itself, and he seized the ringleaders. and prevented the conspiracy from coming to anything. He sent many of his troops elsewhere. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1858, and on 21 May 1859, on his return to England, he was created a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Elphinstone of Elphinstone, Stirlingshire. He died unmarried in King Street, St. James's, London, on 19 July 1860, when his peerage of the United Kingdom became extinct.

The stage of psychosocial development in which identity crisis may occur is called the identity cohesion vs. role confusion. During this stage, adolescents are faced with physical growth, sexual maturity, and integrating ideas of themselves and about what others think of them.(Schultz, 215‚Äì216) Adolescents therefore form their self-image and endure the task of resolving the crisis of their basic ego identity. Successful resolution of the crisis depends on one's progress through previous developmental stages, centering on issues such as trust, autonomy, and initiative. Erikson's own interest in identity began in childhood. Born Ashkenazic Jewish, Erikson felt that he was an outsider. His later studies of cultural life among the Yurok of northern California and the Sioux of South Dakota helped formalize Erikson's ideas about identity development and identity crisis. Erikson described those going through an identity crisis as exhibiting confusion. Concept Sometimes, individuals face obstacles that may prevent the development of a strong identity. This sort of unresolved crisis leaves individuals struggling to \\"find themselves\\". They often seem to have no idea who or what they are, where they belong or where they want to go. They may withdraw from normal life, not taking action or acting as they usually would at work, in their marriage or at school, or be unable to make defining choices about the future. They may even turn to negative activities, such as crime or drugs since from their point of view having a negative identity could be more acceptable than none at all. On the other side of the spectrum, those who emerge from the adolescent stage of personality development with a strong sense of identity are well equipped to face adulthood with confidence and certainty. Erikson felt that peers have a strong impact on the development of ego identity during adolescence. He believed that association with negative groups such as cults or fanatics could actually \\"redistrict\\" the developing ego during this fragile time. The basic strength that Erikson found should be developed during adolescence is fidelity, which only emerges from a cohesive ego identity. Fidelity is known to encompass sincerity, genuineness and a sense of duty in our relationships with other people. He described identity as \\"a subjective sense as well as an observable quality of personal sameness and continuity, paired with some belief in the sameness and continuity of some shared world image. As a quality of unself-conscious living, this can be gloriously obvious in a young person who has found himself as he has found his commonality. In him we see emerge a unique unification of what is irreversibly given--that is, body type and temperament, giftedness and vulnerability, infantile models and acquired ideals--with the open choices provided in available roles, occupational possibilities, values offered, mentors met, friendships made, and first sexual encounters.\\"(Erikson, 730) Marcian theory James Marcia's research on identity statuses of adolescents also applies to Erikson's framework of identity crises in adolescents. Identity foreclosure is an identity status which Marcia claimed is an identity developed by an individual without much choice. \\"The foreclosure status is when a commitment is made without exploring alternatives. Often these commitments are based on parental ideas and beliefs that are accepted without question\\".James Marcia, Identity Development - Aspects of Identity Identity foreclosure can contribute to identity crises in adolescents when the \\"security blanket\\" of their assumed identity is removed. These \\"foreclosed individuals often go into crisis, not knowing what to do without being able to rely on the norms, rules, and situations to which they have been accustomed.\\"Seth J. Scwartz, The Evolution of Eriksonian and Neo- Eriksonian Identity Theory and Research: A review and Integration. \\"Identity, An International Journal of Theory and Research\\", 2001 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, p. 13. An example of this would be a son of a farmer who learns that his father is selling the farm, and whose identity as an heir to a farm and the lifestyle and identity of a farmer has been shaken by that news. Identity diffusion is a Marcian identity status that can lead to identity crises in adolescents. Identity diffusion can be described as \\"the apathetic state that represents the relative lack of both exploration and commitment\\".Ibid. Identity diffusion can overlap with diagnoses such as schizophrenia and depression, and can best be described as a lack of identity structure. An example of an identity crisis emerging from this status is an adolescent who becomes reclusive after his identity as a star athlete is destroyed by a serious injury. Identity moratorium is the status that Marcia theorizes lasts the longest in individuals, is the most volatile, and can be best described as \\"the active exploration of alternatives\\". Individuals experiencing identity moratorium can be very open-minded and thoughtful but also in crisis over their identity.(Schwartz, 12) An example of this would be a college student who lacks conviction in their future after changing majors multiple times but still cannot seem to find their passion. Identity achievement is the resolution to many identity crises. Identity achievement occurs when the adolescent has explored and committed to important aspects of their identity.\\"(Marcia) See also * Erikson's stages of psychosocial development * Existential crisis References Bibliography * Schultz, D. & Schultz, S.

It is located in south-east London on Evans Blvd, in the Summerside subdivision. It is named after M√©tis leader Gabriel Dumont. Proportionate to its size, London has an extremely small francophone population; however, it qualifies for French language services under the French Language Services Act, and also qualifies to have French schools. While there have been French elementary schools in London since 1972, it was not until 1979 that a French high school was created. Originally it was only one class, at London Central Secondary School. Over time, the program grew to include a wide variety of subjects and became known as Le Module scolaire de langue fran√ßaise (MSLF). Due to changes in the organizational structure of the education system in Ontario, the MSLF became Gabriel-Dumont in 1998. It would subsequently move out of Central, and into the same building as the Catholic school. The project that would become CDL had been in the works for over a decade; however, it was stymied by political fighting. In 2007, it was announced that Gabriel-Dumont would move from its location within the CDL project and into its own building in September 2012 on Evans Blvd in the Summerside subdivision.

Prior to starting Project 529, Allard was chief technology and experience officer for the Entertainment and Devices Division at Microsoft. He was instrumental in bringing Microsoft into the Internet age, leading the development of Internet technologies for Windows, and oversaw the company's first foray into the video game industry. Allard shipped over 30 products during his tenure at Microsoft and was a founding member of many Microsoft businesses, including Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox Live, Windows NT and the TCP/IP product families. Education Allard is a 1991 Boston University graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science. In 2003, he received the Distinguished Alumni award and delivered the CS department commencement address. He later received an honorary degree (Doctor of Letters) from Boston University at the 2009 Boston University commencement ceremony alongside Larry Bird and Steven Spielberg. In 2019, Allard was awarded an Edmund Hillary Fellowship (EHF) to New Zealand, joining a community of entrepreneurs and investors to create global change.  Project 529  Allard started the 529 Garage bicycle registration service in 2014 in Portland, Oregon, which today is the world's largest bike registration network, surpassing one million registered users. The service is used by bicycle owners, cities, law enforcement, universities and bike shops as a registration, reporting and recovery program. Since launching the first official test city of Vancouver, Canada in 2015, bike theft has dropped 30% and hundreds of stolen bicycles have been reunited with their owners. The program is now rapidly expanding throughout North America and has captured the attention of the World Bank. Microsoft Allard joined Microsoft in 1991, recruited from Boston University as a Program Manager on the LAN Manager team overseeing the network protocol efforts and NDIS program. The former chief experience officer is best known for developing the Xbox product family, as well as his 1994 memo, \\"Windows: The Next Killer Application on the Internet\\", encouraging the Microsoft team to embrace the Internet. The memo, distributed to Microsoft leaders, captured the attention of Bill Gates and is cited for reshaping the company's direction, earning Allard the reputation as \\"Microsoft's Father of the Internet.\\" According to an internal email, Allard was a network engineer responsible for convincing Microsoft to ship TCP/IP in Windows 95. Allard co- founded the Xbox project in 1999, primarily focused on the Xbox software platform, Xbox Live, and recruiting third-party developers and publishers to support the program. He was later promoted to the position of CTO and CXO of the Entertainment and Devices Division. This role had Allard building a unified design team, an incubation & prototyping team called Alchemie Ventures and new product development such as Zune, Kin and Courier.

Early life  Erickson was born in Long Beach, California. He was highly involved in sports during high school while he attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California. He played baseball, soccer, football, and basketball. He was CCS Junior of the Year in baseball. After completing his secondary education, he graduated from San Jose City College in 1988 with an AA Degree in Business. He was a Junior College 1st Team All American at San Jose. He then majored in Accounting with a minor in Psychology at the University of Arizona. Erickson was inducted into the Arizona Wildcat Hall of Fame after just one year of pitching at Arizona. Erickson set a school record for wins with an 18-3 record, as he led the country in wins (18), innings pitched (175), and complete games (14). Those impressive numbers earned him a unanimous First Team All-American honor. His teammates at Arizona included Trevor Hoffman, Kevin Long, and J. T. Snow. In 1989, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Career = Minor leagues = Erickson began his professional career after being selected in the major league draft four times. He was drafted by the New York Mets in 1986 out of Homestead High School; the Houston Astros in 1987 and Toronto Blue Jays in 1988 out of San Jose City College; and in he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 4th round of the amateur draft out of the University of Arizona.

Financial support is almost always based the student's ‚Ä≥household‚Ä≥ income along with other criteria. Income level limits and eligibility vary from college to college so students must contact their college to obtain this information, although there are some basic eligibility requirements provided by the UK government on their website. If a student is considered to be a vulnerable student, a bursary of up to ¬£1200 is available depending on specific circumstanceshttps://www.gov.uk/1619-bursary-fund/eligibility Many colleges will ask students to make a bursary application using their online bursary application system. Other colleges will require a paper application form to apply. Evidence to support an application will always be required.

He is a mutant, able to generate a \\"warp wave\\" for the purpose of teleportation. He and his sister Lifeguard were briefly members of the squad of X-Men featured in the series X-Treme X-Men. Fictional character biography He and his sister Heather lived perfectly normal lives at Surfers Paradise in Australia. They did not know that their actual father was an underworld crime lord known as Viceroy, and upon his death they were attacked. When Heather's life was endangered, Davis was informed by Sage that although he was never meant to be a mutant (his latent mutant gene was supposed to be passed down to his children) his mutant power might be helpful to her. He agreed to let her activate it, gaining a teleportational ability in the form of the \\"warp wave\\". Together with Storm and Thunderbird III, he and his sister manage to defeat their attackers.

OTR uses a combination of AES symmetric-key algorithm with 128 bits key length, the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the SHA-1 hash function. In addition to authentication and encryption, OTR provides forward secrecy and malleable encryption. The primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniable authentication for the conversation participants while keeping conversations confidential, like a private conversation in real life, or off the record in journalism sourcing. This is in contrast with cryptography tools that produce output which can be later used as a verifiable record of the communication event and the identities of the participants. The initial introductory paper was named \\"Off-the-Record Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP\\". The OTR protocol was designed by cryptographers Ian Goldberg and Nikita Borisov and released on 26 October 2004. They provide a client library to facilitate support for instant messaging client developers who want to implement the protocol. A Pidgin and Kopete plugin exists that allows OTR to be used over any IM protocol supported by Pidgin or Kopete, offering an auto-detection feature that starts the OTR session with the buddies that have it enabled, without interfering with regular, unencrypted conversations. Version 4 of the protocol is currently being designed by a team led by Sof√≠a Celi, and reviewed by Nik Unger and Ian Goldberg. This version aims to provide online and offline deniability, to update the cryptographic primitives, and to support out-of- order delivery and asynchronous communication.  History  OTR was presented in 2004 by Nikita Borisov, Ian Avrum Goldberg, and Eric A. Brewer as an improvement over the OpenPGP and the S/MIME system at the \\"Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society\\" (WPES). The first version 0.8.0 of the reference implementation was published on 21 November 2004. In 2005 an analysis was presented by Mario Di Raimondo, Rosario Gennaro, and Hugo Krawczyk that called attention to several vulnerabilities and proposed appropriate fixes, most notably including a flaw in the key exchange. As a result, version 2 of the OTR protocol was published in 2005 which implements a variation of the proposed modification that additionally hides the public keys. Moreover, the possibility to fragment OTR messages was introduced in order to deal with chat systems that have a limited message size, and a simpler method of verification against man-in-the-middle attacks was implemented. In 2007 Olivier Goffart published \`mod_otr\` for ejabberd, making it possible to perform man-in-the- middle attacks on OTR users who don't check key fingerprints. OTR developers countered this attack by introducing socialist millionaire protocol implementation in libotr. Instead of comparing key checksums, knowledge of an arbitrary shared secret can be utilised for which relatively low entropy can be tolerated by using the socialist millionaire protocol. Version 3 of the protocol was published in 2012. As a measure against the repeated reestablishment of a session in case of several competing chat clients being signed on to the same user address at the same time, more precise identification labels for sending and receiving client instances were introduced in version 3. Moreover, an additional key is negotiated which can be used for another data channel. Several solutions have been proposed for supporting conversations with multiple participants. A method proposed in 2007 by Jiang Bian, Remzi Seker, and Umit Topaloglu uses the system of one participant as a \\"virtual server\\". The method called \\"Multi-party Off-the- Record Messaging\\" (mpOTR) which was published in 2009 works without a central management host and was introduced in Cryptocat by Ian Goldberg et al. In 2013, the Signal Protocol was introduced, which is based on OTR Messaging and the Silent Circle Instant Messaging Protocol (SCIMP). It brought about support for asynchronous communication (\\"offline messages\\") as its major new feature, as well as better resilience with distorted order of messages and simpler support for conversations with multiple participants. OMEMO, introduced in an Android XMPP client called Conversations in 2015, integrates the Double Ratchet Algorithm used in Signal into the instant messaging protocol XMPP (\\"Jabber\\") and also enables encryption of file transfers. In the autumn of 2015 it was submitted to the XMPP Standards Foundation for standardisation. Currently, version 4 of the protocol has been designed. It was presented by Sof√≠a Celi and Ola Bini on PETS2018.  Implementation  In addition to providing encryption and authentication ‚Äî features also provided by typical public-key cryptography suites, such as PGP, GnuPG, and X.509 (S/MIME) ‚Äî OTR also offers some less common features: *Forward secrecy: Messages are only encrypted with temporary per-message AES keys, negotiated using the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange protocol. The compromise of any long-lived cryptographic keys does not compromise any previous conversations, even if an attacker is in possession of ciphertexts. *Deniable authentication: Messages in a conversation do not have digital signatures, and after a conversation is complete, anyone is able to forge a message to appear to have come from one of the participants in the conversation, assuring that it is impossible to prove that a specific message came from a specific person. Within the conversation the recipient can be sure that a message is coming from the person they have identified.  Authentication  As of OTR 3.1, the protocol supports mutual authentication of users using a shared secret through the socialist millionaire protocol. This feature makes it possible for users to verify the identity of the remote party and avoid a man-in-the-middle attack without the inconvenience of manually comparing public key fingerprints through an outside channel.  Limitations  Due to limitations of the protocol, OTR does not support multi-user group chat but it may be implemented in the future. As of version 3 of the protocol specification, an extra symmetric key is derived during authenticated key exchanges that can be used for secure communication (e.g., encrypted file transfers) over a different channel. Support for encrypted audio or video is not planned. (SRTP with ZRTP exists for that purpose.) A project to produce a protocol for multi-party off-the-record messaging (mpOTR) has been organized by Cryptocat, eQualitie, and other contributors including Ian Goldberg.

He is the commissioner of the newly created Leaders' Debates Commission and is Colonel of the Regiment for the Royal Canadian Regiment. Johnston was born and raised in Ontario, studying there before enrolling at Harvard University and later Cambridge and Queen's universities. He went on to work as a professor at various post- secondary institutions in Canada, eventually serving administrative roles as dean of law at the University of Western Ontario, principal of McGill University, and president of the University of Waterloo. At the same time, Johnston involved himself with politics and public service, moderating political debates and chairing commissions in both the federal and provincial spheres, his most renowned position in that field being the chairmanship of the inquiry into the Airbus affair. He was in 2010 appointed as governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of then Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, to replace Micha√´lle Jean as viceroy and he occupied the post until succeeded by Julie Payette in 2017. At the time, Johnston was predominantly praised as a worthy choice for the Queen's representative, though his appointment was denounced by some Quebec sovereigntists. Early life and education Johnston was born on June 28, 1941 in Sudbury, Ontario, to Lloyd Johnston, the owner of a hardware store, and Dorothy Stonehouse. He attended Sault Collegiate Institute in nearby Sault Ste. Marie, where he played quarterback for the football team and under-17 hockey with future National Hockey League (NHL) members Phil and Tony Esposito and Lou Nanne. Johnston aimed to play in the NHL himself and was visited by scout Jimmy Skinner. However, upon learning from Skinner that most boys drafted would not be completing high school, Johnston's mother refused to negotiate further. Johnston graduated high school and moved on to Harvard University in 1959, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree, magna cum laude, in 1963. While at Harvard, under the coaching of Cooney Weiland, Johnston captained the varsity ice hockey team, was twice selected to the All-America team, and met and befriended Erich Segal, the two becoming jogging partners. In 1970, Segal wrote the best-selling novel Love Story, basing a character in the book‚ÄîDavey, a captain of the hockey team‚Äîon Johnston. Johnston suffered three concussions from playing football and hockey; he was told by his doctor to either wear a helmet (at a time when they were unpopular) or stop playing hockey. Upon completing his degree at Harvard, Johnston again looked at an NHL career, contemplating attending the Boston Bruins training camp. Instead, he attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge, obtaining a Bachelor of Laws with honours in 1965, and another with first class honours from Queen's University in 1966. During that period, Johnston married his high school sweetheart, Sharon, with whom he has five daughters. Johnston was hired by Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, but never worked for the firm, instead taking a one-year leave of absence, which continues to today. Academic career Johnston has had a long academic career, during which he came to specialise in securities regulation, corporation law, public policy and information technology law. After 1966, he worked for two years as an assistant professor at the Queen's University Faculty of Law and then joined the University of Toronto's law faculty, where he taught until 1974, eventually being promoted to the rank of full professor. Johnston was then appointed as dean of the University of Western Ontario Law School, serving between 1974 and 1979, at which time he was elevated to become the fourteenth Principal and Vice-Chancellor of McGill University. It was during his time in that role that he became acquainted with Pierre and Margaret Trudeau, as the Johnston children played with the Trudeau children when the families were at their adjacent cottages in the Laurentians. Johnston, then President of the University of Waterloo, introducing Justin Trudeau as a speaker at the university, March 2006 Johnston stepped down in 1994 as principal of McGill to remain at the university only as a law professor until he was in 1999 installed as the fifth President of the University of Waterloo. At that time, the couple acquired a home in Heidelberg, Ontario, and began operating an adjacent horse training ranch, Chatterbox Farm. Boards, commissions, and media Johnston has moderated several televised leaders' debates, the first being between Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark, and Ed Broadbent, prior to the 1979 federal election, and he returned five years later to play the same role before the election of 1984, in a debate featuring Brian Mulroney, John Turner, and Broadbent. He also moderated the provincial leaders' debate featuring David Peterson, Bob Rae, and Larry Grossman, in the run up to the Ontario general election in 1987. Johnston has also acted as moderator of two public affairs panel discussion programmes, The Editors and The World in Review, which aired in the 1990s on both CBC Newsworld in Canada and PBS in the United States. Investigations commissioned by both federal and provincial Crowns-in-Council have been chaired by Johnston, starting with the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy in the late 1980s, followed by the National Task Force on High Speed Broadband Access, the Committee on Information Systems for the Environment, the Advisory Committee on Online Learning, Ontario's Infertility and Adoption Review Panel between 2008 and 2009, and other scientific or public policy panels. He also sat on the Ontario government's Task Force on Management of Large Scale Information and Information Technology Projects and an Ontario Ministry of Health panel investigating \\"smart systems.\\" Johnston further served on various corporate boards of directors, including those of Fairfax Financial Holdings, CGI Group, Dominion Textiles, Southam Incorporated, SPAR Aerospace, Seagram's, and Canada Trust, among others, and on March 22, 2010, was named to the Board of Governors of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. He is the only non-American citizen to chair the Harvard Board of Overseers. On November 14, 2007, Johnston was appointed by Governor General Micha√´lle Jean, on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, as an independent adviser and charged with drafting for the Cabinet the terms of reference for the public inquiry, known as the Oliphant Commission, into the Airbus affair. This appointment itself, however, was criticized by the independent citizens' group Democracy Watch as a conflict of interest, given that Johnston had once reported directly to Mulroney during the latter's time as prime minister. Johnston completed his report on January 11, 2008, listing seventeen questions of interest for further investigation. He did not, however, include as a subject the awarding of the Airbus contract, on the basis that this aspect had already been investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, prompting criticism from opposition members of parliament and accusations that Johnston had acted as the Prime Minister's man. This intensified after it was later revealed that Mulroney had accepted $300,000 in cash from Karlheinz Schreiber, but Oliphant could not examine any possible link between that payment and Airbus due to the narrow scope of the commission's mandate. Others, though, such as Peter George, then-president of McMaster University, and subsequently the editorial board of The Globe and Mail, as well as Andrew Coyne in Maclean's, defended Johnston, detailing his integrity and independence. Johnston's role as special adviser was parodied by Roger Abbott on the January 11, 2008, airing of Air Farce Live. For this corporate, government, charitable, and academic work, Johnston was in 1988 appointed to the Order of Canada as an Officer; he was promoted within the order to the rank of Companion in 1997. Johnston also gained a reputation as a non-partisan individual, but has expressed explicit support for Canadian federalism, having written a book opposing Quebec separatism, If Quebec Goes: The Real Cost of Separation. He has also published numerous books on law, chapters in other volumes, magazine articles, and aided in writing legislation. and sat as the co-chair of the Montreal No Committee during the 1995 Quebec referendum on independence. Governor General of Canada Johnston at the University of Waterloo, 2010 Balmoral Castle, where Johnston met with Queen Elizabeth II prior to his installation as governor general =As governor general-designate= On July 8, 2010, the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada announced that Queen Elizabeth II had approved Prime Minister Stephen Harper's recommendation of Johnston to succeed Micha√´lle Jean as the Queen's representative. At the time, Harper said of Johnston that he represents \\"the best of Canada, he represents hard work, dedication, public service and humility. I am confident he will continue to embody these traits in his new role as the Crown representative in Canada.\\" Johnston himself said in a press conference that he and his wife had always been dedicated to service and vowed to, while in office, defend Canadian heritage and institutions. A special search committee convened by the Prime Minister recommended Johnston for the viceregal position; the group was headed by Sheila-Marie Cook, secretary to the Governor General, and further consisted of Kevin MacLeod, the Canadian Secretary to the Queen, Usher of the Black Rod of the Senate of Canada, and parliament's top protocol officer; Christopher Manfredi, dean of the Faculty of Arts at McGill University; Rainer Knopff, a political scientist at the University of Calgary; Father Jacques Monet, of the Canadian Institute of Jesuit Studies; and Christopher McCreery, historian and private secretary to the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. The committee conducted extensive national consultations with over 200 people including academics, sitting and retired political leaders of all political persuasions including provincial premiers, current and former political party leaders, former prime ministers and others in order to develop a short list of candidates for the position. Also on the short list were other distinguished Canadians, including John de Chastelain and John Fraser. The appointment was widely praised, its announcement garnering positive words from individuals like former University of Toronto president Robert Prichard and columnist Andrew Coyne. Opposition Leader Michael Ignatieff stated, \\"David Johnston's dedication to learning and innovation... combined with his legal expertise and constitutional knowledge makes him an ideal choice for Governor General.\\" Johnston's university colleagues also noted his conciliatory abilities. Columnists stated that Johnston would be suited to face difficult constitutional choices, given the probability that the Canadian parliament's minority status would continue well after the start of his tenure as viceroy. The press in Quebec generally focused on Johnston's ties to McGill University and his prominent role during the 1995 Quebec referendum. The president of Quebec's Conseil de la souverainet√©, G√©rald Larose, declared Johnston to be an \\"adversary\\" of Quebec independence and Mario Beaulieu, head of the Saint-Jean- Baptiste Society, called the nomination of Johnston \\"partisan\\" and the governor general-designate himself a \\"federalist extremist\\", statements that columnist Richard Martineau, criticized for creating a \\"fake scandal\\", since any Governor General of Canada would advocate for Canadian unity. In addition, Johnston's low profile was expected to result in less criticism directed at the governor general's office, compared to his two predecessors. The Queen issued on September 3, 2010, under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, her commission naming Johnston as her next Canadian representative and, three days later, Johnston attended an audience with the Queen during a two-day stay at Balmoral Castle. At that time he was invested by the monarch as a Commander of both the Order of Military Merit and Order of Merit of the Police Forces. Johnston then announced to the media that there would be a theme to his installation ceremony: A call to service; he elaborated: \\"This theme of service echoes that of Her Majesty the Queen's 2010 visit 'Honouring the Canadian Record of Service‚ÄîPast, Present and Future,' and illustrates how the governor general exemplifies the Canadian value of service to community and country.\\" =In office= First months Johnston's swearing-in took place on Parliament Hill, in Ottawa, on October 1, 2010. At his request, the ceremony included Johnston and his wife meeting 143 Canadians (one for each year passed since Confederation), especially from the Canadian Forces and young people, and collecting 26 red and white roses from 13 individuals, one from each of Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories. On the return coach ride from Parliament Hill to Rideau Hall, the viceregal couple stopped to lay the bouquet at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Johnston (third from right) with (from left to right) United States Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides, United States Ambassador to Canada David Jacobson, Minister of State for Science and Technology Gary Goodyear, Canada 2020 Chair Don Newman, and Governor of Michigan Rick Snyder at the US-Canada Partnership: Enhancing the Innovation Ecosystem conference at the Ch√¢teau Laurier in Ottawa, November 2, 2011 One of Johnston's first duties as governor general was to perform the rare task of revoking the commissioning scrolls of an officer of Her Majesty's Canadian Forces, on October 22, 2010, at the direction of the Chief of the Defence Staff, stripping the recently convicted murderer and rapist Russell Williams of his rank of colonel and releasing him from duty under \\"service misconduct\\". On November 4, the Governor General made his first visit to Afghanistan to meet with Canadian troops serving there and the Afghan forces they were training; similar visits to Afghanistan followed through Johnston's tenure, including a Christmas spent with Canadian Forces personnel stationed at Camp Alamo and Camp Black Horse, as did meetings with members of the military in other locations overseas. Johnston with Marina Kaljurand, Ambassador to Canada for Estonia, at Rideau Hall, December 1, 2011 Johnston undertook his first state visits in February and March 2011, journeying to Kuwait (to attend its 50th Independence Day and take part in the celebrations of the fifth anniversary of the accession of Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al- Sabah) and Qatar. He then, in April of the same year, attended the wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine Middleton and the reception at Buckingham Palace that followed. In late June, he hosted the couple at various events during their tour of Canada. The speech Johnston delivered on August 14, 2011, to the Canadian Bar Association's annual meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, attracted media attention for its criticism of the legal profession: the Governor General lamented unnecessary and deliberate legal delays across Canada, the role of unscrupulous American lawyers in the unfolding of the global financial crisis, and said the profession was losing the public's trust. These comments were noted for being unusually controversial for a viceroy, but Johnston's colleagues and the editorial board of The Globe and Mail found the Governor General's words to be both unsurprising and welcome. In keeping with his focus on education, the Governor General, beginning in his early months in office and continuing throughout his time there, visited a number of universities across Canada, attending conferences, delivering lectures, and speaking at convocations. He also carried this theme on during his state and official visits to foreign countries, including in his itinerary, among other events, tours of early education facilities, delivering addresses at universities and colleges, and meetings with economic and social development groups, as well as education ministers. He was also sometimes accompanied by Canadian university and college presidents. Queen's Diamond Jubilee, First Nations issues, and the War of 1812 On Accession Day, February 6, 2012, Johnston took part in events launching Diamond Jubilee Week, marking the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II to the Canadian throne. He thereafter participated in related commemorations, parties, and unveilings of monuments all across the country, throughout the year, as well as during a working visit to the Commonwealth realm Barbados between his aforementioned visit to Brazil and a state visit to Trinidad and Tobago. Johnston later hosted Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, on their tour of parts of Canada for the jubilee celebration and, in June, travelled to London, UK, to take part in various events held there for the jubilee. He then returned to London between July 25 and 30, to attend the Summer Olympics. In January 2012, the Governor General opened the Crown-First Nations summit in Ottawa and at Rideau Hall hosted a meeting with First Nations youth leaders. By the end of the year, in the midst of the First Nations' Idle No More movement, national focus was turned partly on Johnston after Chief of the Attawapiskat First Nation Theresa Spence began a protest, deemed a \\"hunger strike\\", against certain First Nations-related actions by the federal government and parliament and vowed publicly to continue until both Prime Minister Harper and the Governor General together met with her. The Assembly of First Nations also on December 16 issued an open letter the Governor General calling for a meeting to discuss Spence's demands. A meeting between the Prime Minister, other Cabinet ministers, First Nations chiefs, and representatives of the Assembly of First Nations took place on January 11, 2013, but Johnston declined to attend, as \\"it was not appropriate\\" for the representative of a constitutional monarch to publicly participate in discussions on government policy. This, along with other factors, led Spence and other chiefs to boycott the Prime Minister's conference, though she did attend the meeting and ceremony for First Nations chiefs that Johnston hosted at Rideau Hall the same evening. Spence declared after that she was not satisfied with the content of that gathering, vowed to continue her protest, and she and the Governor General communicated directly via letter. Spence ended her protest on January 24, 2013, though the demand for a meeting of First Nations chiefs, Cabinet ministers, and the Governor General together remained in a declaration signed by Spence and two leaders in Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. The bicentennial of the commencement of the War of 1812 was also marked by various official events attended by the Governor General. During the royal tour, Johnston and Prince Charles were on May 22 at a military event at Fort York in Toronto and Johnston was also in the region of Niagara-on-the-Lake on June 16, for various events at Queenston Heights, the Laura Secord homestead, and Fort George, to \\"launch 1,000 days of commemorations\\". A War of 1812 National Recognition Ceremony was also conducted at Rideau Hall on October 25, 2012, at which the Governor General presented special medals and a banner to leaders of First Nations and M√©tis communities with historical ties to the War of 1812. The Governor General served as an honorary witness in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. When the commission's work was completed in December 2015, Johnston presided over a closing ceremony at Rideau Hall, which book-ended the commission along with the opening ceremony hosted by Johnston's viceregal predecessor. He called for expanded education about the residential school system and said \\"this is a moment for national reflection and introspection... to think about the depth of our commitment to tolerance, respect and inclusiveness, and whether we can do better. This is a moment to think about those people ‚Äì those children, those mothers and fathers, those families and those elders, past and present. And it's also a moment to ask: where do we go from here?\\" Columnist John Robson said Johnston displayed a \\"manifest sympathy for aboriginal causes\\". However, the Governor General drew criticism on social media as a consequence of his saying, in an interview on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's radio show The House, on June 17, 2017, that \\"we're a country based on immigration, going right back to our, quote, Indigenous people, unquote, who were immigrants as well, 10, 12, 14,000 years ago\\", referring to the migration of humans across Beringia. Johnston explained he misspoke and apologised for his statement during a ceremony at Rideau Hall to honour leadership on Indigenous issues. Education promotion and charitable foundations Johnston with Cardinal Marc Ouellet and Jason Kenney the evening preceding the Papal inauguration of Pope Francis As part of his efforts to promote education and research, Johnston, beginning in 2012, annually hosted the Killiam Award Symposium at Rideau Hall. In regard to philanthropy, the Governor General established in late 2013 the Rideau Hall Foundation, a charitable group meant to aid the viceroy in connecting and honouring Canadians, enhancing Canadian identity, and increasing potential for excellence with the aid of certain partners. Johnston then launched, via the foundation, the My Giving Moment campaign, encouraging Canadians to donate their time and/or money. He was aided in the launch by George Stroumboulopoulos, who interviewed the Governor General on his show George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight. Johnston stated near the end of his tenure that he would remain as chairman of the Rideau Hall Foundation after his successor took office. In late 2016, the Governor General hosted a conference on concussions, declaring head injuries in sports to be a \\"public health issue\\", and criticized the NHL's position on fighting in hockey. This followed on his remark made in early 2012 to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that hockey should be made safer by redesigning hard- plastic equipment, eliminating head shots and high-sticking, and eliminating fighting, which he said in a later interview was \\"eroding the game\\". He called on the NHL to hold a summit on fighting and concussions. While Johnston did speak with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and the deputy commissioners about a two-day conference that would, with the involvement of medical experts and individuals associated with hockey, decide on new game rules, the group of people involved became too large to manage. Johnston instead turned his attention to the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada and raising awareness among parents. On March 19, 2013, Johnston headed the official Canadian delegation for the Papal inauguration of Pope Francis. On November 1, 2013, he hosted Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, at the 50th anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award royal gala, held at Rideau Hall. Extension of term In March 2015, Johnston accepted an invitation to stay in the viceregal office until September 2017. This was considered desirable in order to ensure that an experienced viceroy was in-place should the 2015 Canadian federal election result in a minority government or otherwise be inconclusive. In September 2017, he became the longest-serving governor general since Georges Vanier. It was also thought worthwhile for Johnston to remain in office for the Canada 150 celebrations. As governor general, Johnston hosted over 600 events at either Rideau Hall or La Citadelle and, as commander-in-chief, attended 330 military events. Within Canada, Johnston visited more than 130 communities and, as part of the country's international relations, he led more than 50 international visits, making him the most travelled governor general in Canadian history. Conversely, he hosted approximately five dozen foreign dignitaries on state and working visits to Canada. The Governor General delivered over 1,400 speeches and awarded tens of thousands of honours, medals, and special commemorations and welcomed 1.5 million Canadians to Rideau Hall and the Citadel. Legacy On September 27, 2017, the week of his departure, he presided over a military farewell ceremony and military parade by a 100-man guard of honour from the Canadian Armed Forces at the Aviation and Space Museum, at Rockcliffe Airport. A few days before Johnston completed his service, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described him as a family friend, \\"a man of strength, intelligence and compassion.\\" He also praised Johnston as an athlete and an academic dedicated to education and lifelong learning. The Government of Canada will donate $3 million, and up to $7 million in matching funds over 10 years, to the Rideau Hall Foundation, a charity founded by Johnston. Its goal, he said, \\"is to gather, align and mobilize ideas, people and resources to move the Canadian spirit and our shared aspirations forward\\". David Johnston's comments during a farewell ceremony on Parliament Hill included the following: \\"Serving as Governor General is a responsibility I have cherished for the past seven years. I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to give back to this country I love so much.\\" Post vice-regal career Shortly after the end of his vice-regal tenure, Johnston joined the consulting firm Deloitte as an executive advisor and will provide advice to private sector and government clients on \\"innovation, inclusiveness, talent development and leadership, and the role those things play in economic growth.\\" Johnston also holds a volunteer position as chair of the Rideau Hall Foundation, the charity he established in 2012. On March 13, 2018, U Sports renamed the U Sports University Cup to the David Johnston University Cup in honour of Johnston. On June 18, 2018, it was announced that Johnston would be appointed Colonel of the Regiment for the Royal Canadian Regiment, effective August 4, 2018. He succeeded Major-General (Retired) J. Ivan Fenton. The position was previously held by Colonel W. J. Aitchison. In October 2018, Johnston was nominated to be the first commissioner of the Leaders' Debates Commission. He was subsequently confirmed to the position., Titles, styles, honours, and arms =Titles= * June 28, 1941 ‚Äì October 1, 2010: Mr David Lloyd Johnston * October 1, 2010 ‚Äì October 2, 2017: His

The society is independent and open to all students of the university, but maintains strong links with debating at Glasgow University Union. History The date of the society's foundation is contested; the earliest paper records of the society are dated before 1770, and there are, moreover, mentions within the university records of a society existing and being open to students who took Logic, back when the university still resided within Glasgow Cathedral. Pope John Paul II issued a 'Papal Letter' to the society upon his visit to Scotland in 1982, which recognised the society's claim to have been established in 1451. The society was formally re-instituted in 1861. The society has led the UK's university debating culture since 1953. In 1955, it won the Observer Mace, now the John Smith Memorial Mace, named after the deceased GUU debater and former leader of the British Labour Party. The GUU has since won the Mace debating championship sixteen more times, far more than any other university. The GUU has also won the World Universities Debating Championships five times. Activities The Glasgow University Union, the principal venue for debating at the University of Glasgow. The society organises a variety of events during term-time, including weekly informal Thursday debates at the Queen Margaret Union. In October, the society holds a New Members' Dinner, followed in March by the annual dinner (this year it will be held on 25 February as a special anniversary celebration), held shortly before the AGM. There is also an Inter- Board Debate, held between the boards of the four major student bodies (Glasgow University Union, Queen Margaret Union, Students' Representative Council and Glasgow University Sports Association), and the Honorary President's Debate, as well as a St Andrews-tide football game and a Sports Day, the Dialectic Olympics. The society holds a number of more informal events, especially during Freshers' Week, to attract new members. Three internal competitions are organised by the society: the Reftable, for new speakers; the Intra-Varsity, a pro-am competition; and the John Duncan Debate, between incoming and outgoing club leaders of the Glasgow University Union's Parliamentary Clubs. The Dialectic Society, along with the Glasgow University Medico-Chirurgical Society and Glasgow University Athletic Club, was one of the founding societies of the Glasgow University Union in 1885, as well as being instrumental in establishing the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council the following year, and remains an active contributor to the activities of both organisations. The GUU was originally an all-male organisation, having been established before the admission of women to the university in 1892. At this time, women were educated at Queen Margaret College, and opportunities for women students to debate existed at the Queen Margaret Union. This activity largely ceased following the admission of women to the GUU in 1980; however, the Dialectic Society has recently been involved in a number of events aimed at its revival. Management Charles Kennedy at the Honorary President's Debate, February 2009 The management of the society is entrusted to a board elected at the annual general meeting (AGM). The board consists of a president, vice-president, honorary secretary, honorary treasurer, assistant honorary secretary, whip secretary, publicity secretary, macer, social convenor, welfare officer, charity officer and two ordinary members. The convenors of debates of the Glasgow University Union and Queen Margaret Union and the society's immediate past president are also ex officio members of the board. The president, vice-president, honorary secretary, honorary treasurer and assistant honorary secretary form the executive. Some quirks of the electoral procedure at the AGM are that posts are filled in descending order, allowing those who failed to win more important posts to stand for others, and that candidates must leave the room while a vote is taken on them. The AGM was traditionally held at the end of the university's Candlemas Term, around the middle of March. Despite the new semester-based structure of the university's academic year, this remains the case and the AGM is now held shortly before the end of the teaching period of the second semester, which is separated from the exam period by the Easter vacation. The society at its AGM also elects an honorary president, up to eight honorary vice-presidents and honorary life members. The current honorary president is Noel Peacock (emeritus professor of the University of Glasgow School of Modern Languages). One of the honorary president's duties is to chair the Honorary President's Debate, held in February each year. Some years this is a debate organised on a special topic, but other years it is the same event as the Inter-board debate. between representatives of the boards of the four main student bodies at the university: the Glasgow University Union, the Queen Margaret Union, the Sports Association and the Students' Representative Council. If not chaired by the honorary president, then the Inter-board debate is chaired by the president of the society. Former members Notable former members of the society include: * Sir Menzies Campbell, former leader of the Liberal Democrats * Donald Dewar, former First Minister of Scotland * Liam Fox, Secretary of State for International Trade * Brian Gill, Lord Gill, Lord Justice Clerk * Derry Irvine, Lord Irvine, former Lord Chancellor * Charles Kennedy, former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Rector of the University * Andrew Neil, journalist and broadcaster * Nicholas Parsons, media personality * Meta Ramsay, former Secret Intelligence Service officer * John Smith, former leader of the Labour Party * Paul Sweeney, Labour & Co-operative MP for Glasgow North East, Shadow Under-Secretary of State for Scotland  Groundings  The society produces Groundings, an interdisciplinary journal publishing work in the humanities, arts, and social sciences. Groundings was established by the society in 2007 and has since been published annually. The purpose of the journal is to provide an opportunity for undergraduate students at the university to have their work peer-reviewed and published in an accessible academic resource as a stepping stone to publication in more mainstream scholarly journals. As such, all entries are written by undergraduate students, and the editorial board is made up of undergraduates, although there exists an advisory panel mainly comprising academics of the university drawn from a range of disciplines. There are generally around ten articles per volume, each written and peer-reviewed by undergraduate students, and each volume of the journal follows a theme, to which it is intended the articles in that volume will relate. The theme for the first volume was \\"Identity and Commemoration\\", and for the second volume, \\"Individuals, institutions, and the relations between them\\". The themes used are intentionally broad in order to accommodate the largest variety possible between submissions, whilst ensuring each volume retains a sense of inherent direction. The journal is produced in paper and electronic form, with initial funding for publication provided by the Chancellor's Fund. Print copies are made available to a number of depositories in the United Kingdom, including the Glasgow University Library, and the journal is also available to read online.

His marriage to wife Maggie is beginning to fall apart. We begin by seeing Jake on stage typing, then, interrupted by a phone call he gets into an argument with sister Karen about meeting up on Saturday night for dinner. After hanging up, an imaginary Maggie 'appears', stating he's always working and he's so busy she doesn't even know why he thought of her. Jake then persuades her to act out the scene in which they met eight years ago at a July fourth party. Maggie plays along for a bit before interrupting the fantasy, stating that the past is not helping them get through the future. Jake expresses his disappointment, and Maggie leaves. Jake then confides in the audience in how his marriage is in trouble, before calling on his sister Karen to help him. Karen 'appears' and expresses her irritation at his calling her while she was watching The Godfather I, II and III. Jake explains that he and Maggie are in trouble, and he believes that she has been having an affair with a new man in her office. Karen aggravates him into admitting he had an affair with an actress a year ago before explaining he loves Maggie more than ever and would do anything to keep her. Maggie then arrives home and has just started upstairs for a shower when Jake explains he wishes to speak to her before dinner. Maggie goes to the bathroom, and Karen warns him not to cause trouble for him. She then leaves. Maggie enters and begins to fix herself a drink, and Jake explains that they are going to dinner with Karen on Saturday before Maggie interrupts, stating she has to go to Philadelphia on Saturday. This then leads to an argument between the two, leading Jake to ask, \\"Do you want out of this marriage?\\" Stunned, Maggie expresses her wish to stay with him before another argument ensues, with Maggie telling Jake he is controlling and spends more time on his work than with her. She then proposes that they separate for six months to give them some breathing space. As Maggie begins to leave the room, Jake asks her if 'Michael Jaffe' has anything to do with the separation. He interrogates Maggie until she admits she has slept with Michael, but it wasn't an affair because \\"it stopped as soon as it started.\\" Maggie then leaves the room. As Jake is sitting there miserably, his daughter Molly, age twelve, \\"appears\\" and begins to talk to him. When asking him if he and Maggie are separating because they both had an affair, Jake violently expresses his reluctance to discuss such matters with a young girl, stating that if she were older, he would discuss it. Younger Molly then agrees, exits, and is replaced by Molly at age twenty one. Older Molly tells her father that the problems between him and Maggie are caused by Julie, Jake's late wife and Molly's mother. Molly then persuades Jake to talk to his psychiatrist in his mind, stating it'll give him complete control - his favourite thing in life. Jake agrees and Molly exits. Edith, Jake's psychiatrist then enters, mocking Jake and his problems. She taunts him and gives seemingly useless advice, stating that he \\"likes to deprive himself.\\" Eventually, she coerces him into saying what he wants the most, which he says is Julie. Julie then appears, at age twenty one, doing a crossword puzzle and asking Jake for the answers. An ice cream truck is then heard and Julie exits. Jake then continues to talk to Edith, getting angrier and angrier at her as she continuously taunts and mocks him. Maggie then enters and Jake fixes her a drink, Edith 'fades out' while telling Jake that he always has options and to listen to his wife. Jake and Maggie then launch into a discussion of how Maggie can't seem to stop \\"running.\\" She explains that she needs time for herself, and after six months they will see if things are any better. Jake scornfully remarks that \\"you can't keep what you give up,\\" and Maggie tells him that Jake never let Julie go, despite her death. We find out that Maggie has been pregnant several times, but evidently has had miscarriages. Maggie then exits. Jake confides in the audience that he has tried to let Julie go, and she is always \\"bursting in on him.\\" Julie, age twenty one then appears, yelling angrily and demanding to know where he has been. Jake is confused until Julie states that they have slept together the previous night. Jake explains to her that it wasn't a late night, and it was twenty-nine years ago. Julie begins to understand that time has passed before stating, \\"last night was wonderful.\\" Jake then explains to her that they could never be together as they once were, and Julie, horrified, asks him if he is dead. Jake calls on Karen to help him explain to Julie her death. Then Julie expresses her relief, telling Jake, \\"I hate it when somebody I love dies.\\" Julie then expresses her irritation at the fact that Jake only calls her when he's in trouble. Edith appears and she and Karen help support Julie's argument. Julie asks Jake to make her thirty-six, but when he tells her he can't, she begins to fade out in annoyance. Jake finally tells her that she never was thirty-six, that she died in a car accident when she was thirty- five while taking Molly up to camp. Edith and Karen leave. At first, Julie is confused as to who Molly is but then realizes she has a daughter. After Jake shows her a photo Julie expresses her wish to see Molly, asking Jake to summon her up. Jake refuses, but eventually agrees to let Molly and Julie meet on Julie's \\"birthday.\\" Molly calls and Jake speaks to her, with Julie exiting. Jake hangs up and tells the audience how Molly is the only human he ever trusted. He then reminisces about the time when Molly and Maggie met eight years ago. A younger Maggie then enters expressing her apologies for being late. She and Jake then chat about going out to dinner before Maggie kisses him just as Molly enters. Molly and Maggie exchange greetings and Maggie hands her a present, which turns out to be an out of date World Atlas. Maggie, embarrassed, admits she grabbed it without looking. Molly then exits, to turn off her TV, and Maggie expresses her joy. She then leaves to the bathroom. Molly enters and tells Jake that he and Maggie should marry straight away. A phone is then heard and Molly leaves. Present Maggie enters and states she is staying at the beach house. She then exits the apartment. Jake gloomily sits on the couch before both Mollys, age twelve and twenty one, appear and sit with him. They try to play a game but it ends up relating back to Maggie, so they simply sit. Act Two: Begins with Jake, once again, seated at his computer typing. Maggie enters seductively and expresses her wish to be with him again, before laughing in his face. It is realized that Maggie is only a hallucination and she leaves. Jake confides in the audience on how his imaginary women are appearing without his summons, before Karen enters, asking to speak with him. Karen and Jake get into an argument over his relationships and it is found that he has had several relationships in the six months that Maggie has been gone. He is currently with a woman named Shelia. Edith arrives and together, she and Karen irritate him. Jake realizes they are \\"really there\\" and calls Edith in order to help get rid of the hallucinations. Karen and Edith then leave. Jake tells the audience he never called Edith‚Äîthat it was a trick to get rid of Karen and Edith in his head. The doorbell rings and Shelia enters. She and Jake have a strange conversation in which Jake's insanity starts to become clear. Maggie then appears and begins to mock Jake from behind Shelia's back. Jake grows angry with Maggie, frequently shouting at her, with Shelia (who cannot see Maggie) growing frightened. She eventually runs out of the house screaming. After an Imaginary reunion between Julie and Molly, the real Maggie returns to talk with Jake. She informs him that she has dinner plans with someone and that she believes that person is going to propose, leading to an argument between Jake and Maggie, and eventually Maggie's departure. Suddenly, Jake hears the voice of his late mother. She informs him of her forgiveness and love of him and then disappears. Then all of the other imaginary characters reappear and say goodbye to Jake. The real Maggie then enters and announces that she canceled the dinner date. She wants to work things out with Jake. Jake walks towards her and they reach out towards each other like The Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel. The lights fade to black. Film In 1996, the play was made into a TV movie starring Alan Alda with direction by Glenn Jordan.Jake's Women Internet Movie Database, accessed April 13, 2012Jake's Women .tcm.com, accessed April 13, 2012 Both Alda and Van Patten were brought in from the original cast to reprise respectively the roles of Jake and Edith.

He was also a noted biographer of Rupert Brooke (1964, Faber and Faber) and Edward Marsh (1958, James Tait Black Memorial Prize 1959). Biography Hassall was born in London and educated at St Michael's College, Tenbury, Brighton College and Wadham College, Oxford. He was the son of the illustrator John Hassall and brother of Joan Hassall, who engraved the title page of his book of poetry, Devil's Dyke, published in 1936. Hassall married the actress Eve Lynett, with whom he had a son and a daughter, the actress Imogen Hassall. Hassall was an experienced actor serving as Ivor Novello's understudy in a minor London drama when Novello invited him to provide the lyrics for a new musical. Their successful collaboration for Glamorous Night (1935) (\\"Shine Through My Dreams\\", \\"Fold Your Wings\\") began a fifteen-year partnership that included six long-running hits. ('Perchance to Dream' the other hit which Novello wrote during this period, had lyrics by Novello himself). While their musicals delighted West End audiences, they were judged \\"too British\\" for America. Jeremy Northam, who played a character based on Ivor Novello in the 2001 Robert Altman movie, Gosford Park, sang \\"I Can Give You the Starlight\\" from The Dancing Years, Hassall's and Novello's 1939 musical. During World War II in 1940, Hassall served in an anti-aircraft gun emplacement with editor John Guest, architect Denys Lasdun, and socialite Angus Menzies. A man of many talents, he recorded a record album entitled Great Voices Read Poetry (1954-1955) along with Richard Burton, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, Robert Hardy, and Anthony Quayle. Hassall's contributions included: Upon Westminster Bridge, Daffodils, and Ode: Intimations of Immortality by William Wordsworth; and Death Be Not Proud by John Donne. Hassall lived at Tonford Manor, a house with a mediaeval stone tower situated by the River Stour on the outskirts of Canterbury. He delighted in its fine prospect and had a road named after him in the community. At St Nicholas's Church in nearby Thanington is a small pane of glass engraved in his memory. Shortly before his death in 1963, Hassall spoke about the first Stour Music Festival, saying: > The shared experience ‚Ä¶ a communion between listener and performer ‚Ä¶ > impossible in a great assembly ‚Ä¶ (which) means the restoration of a large > body of music to the private salon or to the church where it originally > belonged. With the appropriate setting and a perceptive audience of > proportionate size, the work will not only sound, but feel right. Hassall died on a train at Rochester, Kent, on 25 AprilJohn Wakeman, Stanley Kunitz, World Authors, 1950-1970: A Companion Volume to Twentieth Century Authors Wilson (publisher), 1975, page 619 1963 after suffering a heart attack whilst running for the train to see his daughter Imogen appear in a Royal Ballet School performance at Covent Garden.

Unburnt fuel that is ignited in the exhaust system can produce loud sounds even if flames are not present at the tailpipe, which is called an afterburn or backfire since a backfire occurs in the exhaust system. A visible flame may momentarily shoot out of the exhaust pipe under some conditions. Either condition may cause a loud popping noise and usually indicates an improperly- tuned engine. Common causes of backfire are running rich (too much fuel going into cylinders) or faulty ignition, possibly a fouled (dirty) spark plug, coil, or plug wire. A \\"pop-back\\" (inlet manifold, carburetor/throttle body, or air cleaner) of an internal combustion engine can occur when the valves are not shutting correctly. The term derives from parallel experiences with early unreliable firearms or ammunition in which the explosive force was directed out at the breech instead of the muzzle. That is the origin of the use of \\"backfire\\" to indicate producing an unintended, unexpected, and undesired result.  Explanation  Backfiring in internal combustion engines occurs outside of the combustion chamber, and may be the result of an improper air to fuel ratio or poor ignition. The burnt fuel then enters the intake system, causing the air fuel mixture in the intake system to combust. Pop-backs may also occur before the combustion chamber. One possible cause of this is timing. If the timing is too early, the spark plug fires before the intake valves close, causing the combustion to propagate into the intake manifold, further igniting the air-fuel mixture there; the resulting explosion then travels out of the carburetor and air filter. On many small marine engines, a screen is placed over the intake of the carburetor as a flame arrestor, to prevent these flames from escaping the intake and potentially igniting fuel or fuel vapors in the enclosed sump or bilge of the boat, causing a fire or explosion. Alternatively, the ignition timing may be late, in which case the combustion is not completed by the time the exhaust valves open, allowing the combustion to propagate into the exhaust system. Additionally, improperly adjusted carburetors that create a lean condition during acceleration can cause the air‚Äìfuel mixture to burn so slowly that combustion is still taking place during the exhaust stroke, and even when the intake valve opens. The flame front can then travel up the intake and cause a popback. In this situation it is conceivable that there is a popback occurring in the intake manifold and exhaust manifold simultaneously. In both cases (combustion occurring before and after the combustion chamber), the result is a sharp pop, which is colloquially referred to as a \\"backfire\\". However, for troubleshooting, engine mechanics more strictly define an ignition of fuel within the engine exhaust system as a \\"backfire\\", while a \\"popback\\" is this same process taking place in the induction system.  Causes  Exhaust system backfires occur in engines that have an emission system malfunction, like an air injection system diverter valve problem, an exhaust leak, or when the catalytic converter has been removed. In some high-performance vehicles, when a driver shifts up and lets off the accelerator, the engine has a moment of running rich. This causes an incomplete burn which causes the fumes to explode in the exhaust system along with an audible pop or bang sound. This is a result of working equipment, and is unlikely to cause damage. A fuel-injected engine may backfire if an intake leak is present (causing the engine to run lean), or a fuel injection component such as an air-flow sensor is defective. Common causes of backfires are: * Wankel rotary engines are known for leaking oil into the exhaust system which causes backfire. * Poor or unregulated engine timing is often a cause of intake backfires, but can also be responsible for exhaust backfires. Backfires and loud explosion-like sounds are common when an antilag system is present and active. * Improper wiring in the ignition can also lead to timing issues and backfires. * Low fuel pressure, clogged fuel filters, and weak fuel pumps could cause a severely lean air-to-fuel ratio during the fuel injection process. * A missing or damaged catalytic converter can result in backfires out the tailpipe. * Broken exhaust-system piping, especially if located immediately downstream of the exhaust manifold, can result in backfiring underneath the vehicle.  Applications  With older engine designs, backfiring can be common or unavoidable. Backfire is rare in modern vehicles with fuel-injection and computer-controlled fuel mixtures. Cars with sports exhausts (both factory- fitted and aftermarket) are much more likely to backfire. In some circumstances the backfire is seen as an additional perk of the car. The TVR Cerbera is an example of a car with factory-fitted sports exhausts which produce frequent backfires on engine braking. In high-powered supercharged aircraft piston engines such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Griffon, backfiring into the inlet manifold is prevented with flame traps inside the manifold, the traps preventing the flame propagating into the compressed air/fuel mixture within the manifold.

The country's diverse geography and long history, marked by successive waves of settlers through both migration and military conquest, are all reflected in its architecture. This architectural heritage ranges from ancient Roman and Berber sites to 20th-century colonial and modern architecture. The most recognizably \\"Moroccan\\" architecture, however, is the traditional architecture that developed in the Islamic period (7th century and after) which dominates much of Morocco's documented history and its existing heritage. This \\"Islamic architecture\\" of Morocco was part of a wider cultural and artistic complex, often referred to as \\"Hispano-Moorish\\" art, which characterized Morocco, al-Andalus (Muslim Spain and Portugal), and parts of Algeria and even Tunisia. It blended influences from Berber culture in North Africa, pre-Islamic Spain (Roman, Byzantine, and Visigothic), and contemporary artistic currents in the Islamic Middle East to elaborate a unique style over centuries with recognizable features such as the \\"Moorish\\" arch, riad gardens (courtyard gardens with a symmetrical four-part division), and elaborate geometric and arabesque motifs in wood, stucco, and tilework (notably zellij). The ksar of Ait Benhaddou, in the southern High Atlas mountains of Morocco. Although Moroccan Berber architecture is not strictly separate from the rest of Moroccan architecture, many structures and architectural styles are distinctively associated with traditionally Berber or Berber-dominated regions of Morocco such as the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara and pre-Sahara regions.L. Golvin, ¬´ Architecture berb√®re ¬ª, Encyclop√©die berb√®re [online], 6 (1989), document A264, published online on December 1, 2012, accessed on April 10, 2020. URL : http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2582 These mostly rural regions are marked by numerous kasbahs (fortresses) and ksour (fortified villages) shaped by local geography and social structures, of which one of the most famous is Ait Benhaddou. They are typically made of rammed earth and decorated with local geometric motifs. Far from being isolated from other historical artistic currents around them, the Berbers of Morocco (and across North Africa) adapted the forms and ideas of Islamic architecture to their own conditions and in turn contributed to the formation of Western Islamic art, particularly during their political domination of the region over the centuries of Almoravid, Almohad, and Marinid rule. Colonial architecture in Casablanca Modern architecture in Morocco includes many examples of early 20th-century Art Deco and local neo-Moorish (or Mauresque) architecture constructed during the French (and Spanish) colonial occupation of the country between 1912 and 1956 (or until 1958 for Spain). In the later 20th century, after Morocco regained its independence, some new buildings continued to pay tribute to traditional Moroccan architecture and designs, as exemplified by the massive Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca completed in 1993. Modernist architecture is also evident in contemporary constructions, not only for regular everyday structures but also in major prestige projects.  History  Volubilis, founded in the 3rd century BC and abandoned in the 11th century. = From Antiquity to early Islamic period (up to 10th century) = horseshoe arches and interlacing arches of the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain. Started in the 8th century, the mosque had great influence over subsequent architecture in the region.alt= The 10th-century alt= Although less well- documented, Morocco's earliest historical periods were dominated by the indigenous Berber populations (still present today), up to the Berber kingdoms of Mauretania. Roman occupation and settlement was much less extensive than in other nearby regions like Hispania or \\"Africa\\" (Tunisia) but nonetheless left notable sites such as Volubilis, which acted as an important early urban center. In the early 8th century the region became steadily integrated into the emerging Muslim world, beginning with the military incursions of Musa ibn Nusayr and becoming more definitive with the advent of the Idrisid dynasty at the end of that century. The arrival of Islam was extremely significant as it developed a new set of societal norms (although some of them were familiar to Judeo-Christian societies) and institutions which therefore shaped, to some extent, the types of buildings being built and the aesthetic or spiritual values that guided their design.Hattstein, Markus and Delius, Peter (eds.), 2011, Islam: Art and Architecture. h.f.ullmann. The Idrisids founded the city of Fes, which became their capital and the major political and cultural center of early Islamic Morocco. In this early period Morocco also absorbed waves of immigrants from Tunisia and al-Andalus (Muslim-ruled Spain and Portugal), who brought in cultural and artistic influences from their home countries. The earliest well-known Islamic-era monuments in Morocco, such as the al- Qarawiyyin and Andalusi mosques in Fes, were built in the hypostyle form and made early use of the horseshoe or \\"Moorish\\" arch. These reflected early influences from major monuments like the Great Mosque of Kairouan and the Great Mosque of Cordoba. In the 10th century much of northern Morocco came directly within the sphere of influence of the Ummayyad Caliphate of Cordoba, with competition from the Fatimid Caliphate further east. Early contributions to Moroccan architecture from this period include expansions to the Qarawiyyin and Andalusi mosques and the addition of their square-shafted minarets, anticipating the later standard form of Moroccan minarets. = The Berber Empires: Almoravids, Almohads and Marinids (11th-15th centuries) = Almoravid Koubba in Marrakesh (early 12th century).alt= The alt= The collapse of the Cordoban caliphate in the early 11th century was followed by the significant advance of Christian kingdoms into Muslim al-Andalus and the rise of major Berber empires in Morocco. The latter included first the Almoravids (11th-12th centuries) and then the Almohads (12th-13th centuries), both of whom also took control of remaining Muslim territory in al-Andalus, creating empires that stretched across large parts of western and northern Africa and into Europe. This period is considered one of the most formative stages of Moroccan and Moorish architecture, establishing many of the forms and motifs that were refined in subsequent centuries. These two empires were responsible for establishing a new imperial capital at Marrakesh and the Almohads also began construction of a monumental capital in Rabat. The Almoravids adopted the architectural developments of al-Andalus, such as the complex interlacing arches of the Great Mosque in Cordoba and of the Aljaferia palace in Zaragoza, while also introducing new ornamental techniques from the east such as muqarnas (\\"stalactite\\" or \\"honeycomb\\" carvings). The Almohad Kutubiyya and Tinmel mosques are often considered the prototypes of later Moroccan mosques. The monumental minarets (e.g. the Kutubiyya minaret, the Giralda of Seville, and the Hassan Tower of Rabat) and ornamental gateways (e.g. Bab Agnaou in Marrakesh, and Bab Oudaia and Bab er-Rouah in Rabat) of the Almohad period also established the overall decorative schemes that became recurrent in these architectural elements thenceforth. The minaret of the Kasbah Mosque of Marrakech was particularly influential and set a style that was repeated, with minor elaborations, in the following Marinid period. The courtyard of the 14th-century Marinid Bou Inania Madrasa. The Berber Marinid dynasty that followed was also important in further refining the artistic legacy established by their predecessors. Based in Fes, they built monuments with increasingly intricate and extensive decoration, particularly in wood and stucco. They were also the first to deploy extensive use of zellij (mosaic tilework in complex geometric patterns). Notably, they were the first to build madrasas, a type of institution which originated in Iran and had spread west. The madrasas of Fes, such as the Bou Inania, al-Attarine, and as-Sahrij madrasas, as well as the Marinid madrasa of Sal√© and the other Bou Inania in Meknes, are considered among the greatest architectural works of this period.Kubisch, Natascha (2011). \\"Maghreb - Architecture\\" in Hattstein, Markus and Delius, Peter (eds.) Islam: Art and Architecture. h.f.ullmann. While mosque architecture largely followed the Almohad model, one noted change was the progressive increase in the size of the sahn or courtyard, which was previously a minor element of the floor plan but which eventually, in the subsequent Saadian period, became as large as the main prayer hall, and sometimes larger. The architectural style under the Marinids was very closely related to that found in the Emirate of Granada, in Spain, under the contemporary Nasrid dynasty. The decoration of the famous Alhambra is thus reminiscent of what was built in Fes at the same time. When Granada was conquered in 1492 by Catholic Spain and the last Muslim realm of al-Andalus came to an end, many of the remaining Spanish Muslims (and Jews) fled to Morocco and North Africa, further increasing the Andalusian influence in these regions in subsequent generations. = The Sharifian dynasties: Saadians and Alaouites (16th-19th centuries) = The Chamber of the Twelve Columns in the left A carved and painted wooden ceiling in the Bahia Palace (late 19th to early 20th century). After the Marinids came the Saadian dynasty, which marked a political shift from Berber-led empires to sultanates led by Arab sharifian dynasties. Artistically and architecturally, however, there was broad continuity and the Saadians are seen by modern scholars as continuing to refine the existing Moroccan-Moorish style, with some considering the Saadian Tombs in Marrakesh as one of the apogees of this style. Starting with the Saadians, and continuing with the Alaouites (their successors and the reigning monarchy today), Moroccan art and architecture is portrayed by modern scholars as having remained essentially \\"conservative\\"; meaning that it continued to reproduce the existing style with high fidelity but did not introduce major new innovations. Many of the mosques and palaces standing in Morocco today have been built or restored by the Alaouites at some point or another. Ornate architectural elements from Saadian buildings, most famously from their lavish el-Badi Palace in Marrakesh, were also stripped and reused in buildings elsewhere during the reign of Moulay Isma'il (1672‚Äì1727). Moulay Isma'il is also notable for having built a vast imperial capital in Meknes, where the remains of his monumental structures can still be seen today. Up until the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Alaouite sultans and their ministers continued to build beautiful palaces, many of which are now used as museums or tourist attractions, such as the Bahia Palace in Marrakesh or the Dar Batha in Fes. = Modern and contemporary architecture: 20th century to present day = Bank al-Maghrib in Rabat, completed in 1930 under French colonial rule, with Mauresque (Neo-Moorish) flourishes In the 20th century, Moroccan architecture and cities were also shaped by the period of French colonial control (1912-1956) as well as Spanish colonial rule in the north of the country (1912-1958). This era introduced new architectural styles such as Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and other modernist styles, in addition to European ideas about urban planning imposed by colonial authorities. The European architects and planners also drew on traditional Moroccan architecture to develop a style sometimes referred to as Neo-Mauresque (a type of Neo-Moorish style), blending contemporary European architecture with a \\"pastiche\\" of traditional Moroccan architecture. The French moved the capital to Rabat and founded a number of Villes Nouvelles (\\"New Cities\\") next to the historic medinas (old walled cities) to act as new administrative centers, which have since grown beyond the old cities. In particular, Casablanca was developed into a major port and quickly became the country's most populous urban centre. As a result, the city's architecture became a major showcase of Art Deco and colonial Mauresque architecture. Notable examples include the civic buildings of Muhammad V Square (Place Mohammed V), the Cathedral of Sacr√©-Coeur, the Art Deco-style Cin√©ma Rialto, the Neo-Moorish-style Mahkamat al-Pasha in the Habous district. Similar architecture also appeared in other major cities like Rabat and Tangier, with examples such as the Gran Teatro Cervantes in Tangier and the Bank al-Maghrib and post office buildings in downtown Rabat. Elsewhere, the smaller southern town of Sidi Ifni is also notable for Art Deco architecture dating from the Spanish occupation. The new extension to the Marrakesh Menara Airport, completed in 2008. In the later 20th century, after Morocco regained its independence, and into the 21st century, contemporary Moroccan architecture also continued to pay tribute to the country's traditional architecture. In some cases, international architects were recruited to design Moroccan-style buildings for major royal projects such as the Mausoleum of Mohammed V in Rabat and the massive Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca. The monumental new gates of the Royal Palace in Fez, built in 1969-1971, also made use of traditional Moroccan craftsmanship. The new train stations of Marrakesh and Fes are examples of traditional Moroccan forms being adapted to modern architecture. Modernist architecture has also continued to be used, exemplified by buildings like the Sunna Mosque (1966) and the Twin Center (1999) in Casablanca. More recently, some 21st-century examples of major or prestigious architecture projects include the extension of Marrakesh's Menara Airport (completed in 2008), the award-winning High-Speed Train Station in Kenitra (opened in 2018), the Finance City Tower in Casablanca (completed in 2019 and one of the tallest buildings in Morocco), and the new Grand Theatre of Rabat by Zaha Hadid (due to be completed in late 2019).  Influences  = Amazigh = Structures such as agadirs (fortified granaries) and qs≈´r or qsars (fortified villages) are prominent traditional features of Amazigh architecture in Morocco. = Arab = The Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech, completed in the Almohad period 1184‚Äì1199 The conversion of the Berber tribes in Morocco to Islam by Idris I of Morocco greatly influenced the overall architectural style of the country. The elegance of Islamic features is blended in and adapted into buildings and interior designs such as the use of tiling, fountains, geometric design and floral motifs. Which could be seen in mosques, palaces, plazas as well as homes. The materials chosen for the interiors of Moroccan classical architecture, are due in part to the necessity of cooling in the arid land climate of Morocco. * Tiles ‚Äì Zellige tiling is used to decorate the surfaces of buildings and objects, principally interior walls, floors, and fountains. Modern use of zellige has extended the use to furniture and other interiors. * Fountains ‚Äì Before the conversion, water was already an important part of Moroccan culture; however, Islam made water much more important functionally because of the ritual ablution before prayer. Thus, fountains, also representing paradise, could be found everywhere in order to serve everyone. * Mosques ‚Äì Following the introduction of Islam, mosques were built in Morocco with their distinct architectural features. * Geometric Design and Floral Motifs Arabesque ‚Äì Based on Islamic beliefs, avoiding the use of human or animal images is preferable resulting in the spread of floral motifs (arabesques) and geometric patterns. The motifs in Moroccan architectural decor are chiefly carved into stone, plaster and wood. Moroccan Islamic architecture is not confined to the country. For example, Sheikha Salama Mosque in the UAE city of Al Ain has two minarets which partly look Moroccan. = Moorish (Iberia 711‚Äì1492) = Alhambra garden in Granada, Spain, 13th‚Äì14th century Much of the Iberian Peninsula was a Moorish domain from the early 8th century to the late 15th century and was known as Al- Andalus 711 to 1492. During the 11th century the berber dynasty of the Almohad Caliphate, ruled Morocco and the southern part of modern-day Spain the most famous of their remaining buildings are the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh, the Giralda of Seville, Spain and the Hassan Tower, in Rabat, Morocco. The Almoravid dynasty ruled Morocco and the southern half of Spain through the 12th century. The Marinid dynasty from the 13th through the 15th century, rule both Moroccan and Southern Spain until the Reconquista with the fall of Granada in 1492, effectively ending the Moorish era in Iberia. Moorish architecture therefore evolved into a distinct form. The elements of which are as follows: * Arches ‚Äì Arches are common feature in Morocco, which can be divided into two types. The first arch is the horseshoe which is clover shaped. The second is cusped like a rounded keyhole. These are called Moorish arches. * Tiling ‚Äì Overlapping roof tiling became popular after the influence of Spain; the tiles are mostly hand glazed. = French = A Moroccan alley The Treaty of Fes established the French Protectorate in 1912. The French resident general Hubert Lyautey appointed Henri Prost to oversee the urban development of cities under his control. In April 1914, the colonial government promulgated a dahir for the \\"arrangement, development, and extension of urban plans, easements, and road tolls\\". This dahir included building standards which directly affected the architecture at that time, as follows: # Buildings could not be higher than four stories. # Land use regulation required twenty percent of a planned area to be courtyards or gardens. # Balconies must not overlook neighboring residences. # Roofs of all buildings should be flat. The building regulations maintained the country's preexisting architectural features and balanced the rapid urbanization.  Types of structures  The following is a summary of the different major types and functions of buildings and architectural complexes found in historic Moroccan architecture. = Religious architecture =  Mosques  Chrabliyin Mosque in Fes An aisle of horseshoe arches in the 12th-century Kutubiyya Mosque Mosques are the main place of worship in Islam. Muslims are called to prayer five times a day and participate in prayers together as a community, facing towards the qibla (direction of prayer). Every neighbourhood normally had one or many mosques in order to accommodate the spiritual needs of its residents. Historically, there was a distinction between regular mosques and \\"Friday mosques\\" or \\"grand mosques\\", which were larger and had a more important status by virtue of being the venue where the khutba (sermon) was delivered on Fridays. Friday noon prayers were considered more important and were accompanied by preaching, and also had political and social importance as occasions where news and royal decrees were announced, as well as when the current ruler's name was mentioned. In the early Islamic era of Morocco, there was typically only one Friday mosque per city, but over time Friday mosques multiplied until it was common practice to have one in every neighbourhood or district of the city. Mosques could also frequently be accompanied by other facilities which served the community. left The Grand Mosque of Chefchaouen (15th-16th century), with an octagonal minaret Mosque architecture in Morocco was heavily influenced from the beginning by major well-known mosques in Tunisia and al-Andalus (Muslim Spain and Portugal), two countries from which many Arab and Muslim immigrants to Morocco originated. The Great Mosque of Kairouan and the Great Mosque of Cordoba, in particular, were models of mosque architecture. Accordingly, most mosques in Morocco have roughly rectangular floor plans and follow the hypostyle format: they consist of a large prayer hall upheld and divided by rows of horseshoe arches running either parallel or perpendicular to the qibla wall (the wall towards which prayers faced). The qibla (direction of prayer) was always symbolized by a decorative niche or alcove in the qibla wall, known as a mihrab. Next to the mihrab there was usually a symbolic pulpit known as a minbar. The mosque also normally included, close to entrance, a sahn (courtyard) which often had fountains or water basins to assist with ablutions. In early periods this courtyard was relatively minor in proportion to the rest of the mosque, but in later periods it became a progressively larger until it was equal in size to the prayer hall and sometimes larger. Lastly, mosque buildings were distinguished by their minarets: towers from which the muezzin issues the call to prayer to the surrounding city. (This was historically done by the muezzin climbing to the top and projecting his voice over the rooftops, but nowadays the call is issued over modern megaphones installed on the tower.) Moroccan minarets traditionally have a square shaft and are arranged in two tiers: the main shaft, which makes up most of its height, and a much smaller secondary tower above this which is in turn topped by a finial of copper or brass spheres. Some Moroccan minarets have octagonal shafts, though this is more characteristic of the northern parts of the country. Inside the main shaft a staircase, and in other cases a ramp, ascends to the top of the minaret. Medieval Moroccan mosques also frequently followed the \\"T-type\\" model established in the Almohad period. In this model the aisle or \\"nave\\" between the arches running towards the mihrab (and perpendicular to the qibla wall) was wider than the others, as was also the aisle directly in front of and along the qibla wall (running parallel to the qibla wall); thus forming a \\"T\\"-shaped space in the floor plan of the mosque which was often accentuated by greater decoration (e.g. more elaborate arch shapes around it or decorative cupola ceilings at each end of the \\"T\\"). The whole structure of a mosque was also orientated or aligned with the direction of prayer (qibla), such that mosques were sometimes orientated in a different direction from the rest of the buildings or streets around it. This geographic alignment, however, varied greatly from period to period. Nowadays it is standard practice across the Muslim world that the direction of prayer is the direction of the shortest distance between oneself and the Kaaba in Mecca. In Morocco, this corresponds to a generally eastern orientation (varying slightly depending on your exact position). However, in early Islamic periods there were other interpretations of what the qibla should be. In the western Islamic world (the Maghreb and al- Andalus), in particular, early mosques often had a southern orientation, as can be seen in major early mosques like the Great Mosque of Cordoba and the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fes. This was based on a reported hadith of the Prophet Muhammad which stated that \\"what is between the east and west is a qibla\\", as well as on a popular view that mosques should not be aligned towards the Kaaba but rather that they should follow the cardinal orientation of the Kaaba itself (which is a rectangular structure with its own geometric axes), which is in turn aligned according to certain astronomical references (e.g. its minor axis is aligned with the sunrise of the summer solstice). A traditional synagogue interior in Sefrou  Synagogues  Although much reduced today, the Jewish community of Morocco has a long history, resulting in the presence of many synagogues across the country (some of which are defunct and some of which are still functioning). Synagogues had a very different layout from mosques but often shared similar decorative trends as the rest of Moroccan architecture, such as colourful tilework and carved stucco, though later synagogues were built in other styles too. Notable examples of synagogues in Morocco include the Ibn Danan Synagogue in Fes, the Slat al-Azama Synagogue in Marrakesh, or the Beth-El Synagogue in Casablanca, though numerous other examples exist.  Madrasas  The courtyard of the 14th-century al- Attarine Madrasa in Fes A student's room in the Ben Youssef Madrasa, Marrakesh The madrasa was an institution which originated in northeastern Iran by the early 11th century and was progressively adopted further west. These establishments provided higher education and served to train Islamic scholars, particularly in Islamic law and jurisprudence (fiqh). The madrasa in the Sunni world was generally antithetical to more \\"heterodox\\" religious doctrines, including the doctrine espoused by the Almohad dynasty. As such, it only came to flourish in Morocco in the late 13th century, under the Marinid dynasty which succeeded the Almohads. To the Marinids, madrasas also played a part in bolstering the political legitimacy of their dynasty. They used this patronage to encourage the loyalty of the country's influential but independent religious elites and also to portray themselves to the general population as protectors and promoters of orthodox Sunni Islam. Finally, madrasas also played an important role in training the scholars and elites who operated the state bureaucracy. Madrasas also played a supporting role to major learning institutions like the Qarawiyyin Mosque; in part because, unlike the mosque, they provided accommodations for students who came from outside the city. Many of these students were poor, seeking sufficient education to gain a higher position in their home towns, and the madrasas provided them with basic necessities such as lodging and bread. However, the madrasas were also teaching institutions in their own right and offered their own courses, with some Islamic scholars making their reputation by teaching at certain madrasas. Madrasas were generally centered around a main courtyard with a central fountain, off which other rooms could be accessed. Student living quarters were typically distributed on an upper floor around the courtyard. Many madrasas also included a prayer hall with a mihrab, though only the Bou Inania Madrasa of Fes officially functioned as a full mosque and featured its own minaret. In the Marinid era, madrasas also evolved to be lavishly decorated.  Mausoleums and zawiyas  mausoleum of Moulay Idris II in Fes Most Muslim graves are traditionally simple and unadorned, but in North Africa the graves of important figures were often covered in a domed structure (or a cupola of often pyramidal shape) called a qubba (also spelled koubba). This was especially characteristic for the tombs of \\"saints\\" such as walis and marabouts: individuals who came to be venerated for their strong piety, reputed miracles, or other mystical attributes. Many of these existed within the wider category of Islamic mysticism known as Sufism. Some of these tombs became the focus of entire religious complexes built around them, known as a zawiya (also spelled zaouia; ). They typically included a mosque, school, and other charitable facilities. Such religious establishments were major centers of Moroccan Sufism and grew in power and influence over the centuries, often associated with specific Sufi Brotherhoods or schools of thought. The Saadian dynasty, for example, began as a military force associated with the zawiya and followers of Muhammad al-Jazuli, a major 15th-century Sufi scholar. The Alaouites after them also sponsored many zawiyas across the country. Some of the most important examples of zawiyas in Morocco include the Zawiya of Moulay Idris I near Meknes, the Zawiya of his son Moulay Idris II in Fes, and the tombs of the Seven Saints in Marrakesh. = Civic architecture =  Funduqs  Interior of the 18th-century alt= A funduq (also spelled foundouk or fondouk; ) was a caravanserai or commercial building which served as both an inn for merchants and a warehouse for their goods and merchandise. In Morocco some funduqs also housed the workshops of local artisans. As a result of this function, they also became centers for other commercial activities such as auctions and markets. They typically consisted of a large central courtyard surrounded by a gallery, around which storage rooms and sleeping quarters were arranged, frequently over multiple floors. Some were relatively simple and plain, while others, like the Funduq al-Najjariyyin (or Fondouk Nejjarine) in Fes, were quite richly decorated.  Hammams  alt= Hammams () are public bathhouses which were ubiquitous in Muslim cities. Many historic hammams have been preserved in cities like Marrakesh and especially Fez, partly thanks to their continued use by locals up to the present day. Among the better-known examples of preserved historic hammams in Morocco is the 14th-century Saffarin Hammam in Fez, which has recently undergone restoration and rehabilitation. Essentially derived from the Roman bathhouse model, hammams normally consisted of four main chambers: a changing room, from which one then moved on to a cold room, a warm room, and a hot room. Heat and steam were generated by a hypocaust system which heated the floors. The furnace re- used natural organic materials (such as wood shavings, olive pits, or other organic waste byproducts) by burning them for fuel. The smoke generated by this furnace helped with heating the floors while excess smoke was evacuated through chimneys. Of the different rooms, only the changing room was heavily decorated with zellij, stucco, or carved wood. The cold, warm, and hot rooms were usually vaulted or domed chambers without windows, designed to keep steam from escaping, but partially lit thanks to small holes in the ceiling which could be covered by ceramic or coloured glass.  Public fountains  The 16th-century Mouassine Fountain in Marrakesh, attached to the alt= As in many Muslim cities, water was provided freely to the public through a number of street fountains, similar to sebils in the former Ottoman Empire. Some fountains were decorated with a canopy of sculpted wood or zellij tilework. Fountains were often attached to the outside of mosques, funduqs, and aristocratic mansions. According to Leo Africanus, a traveler and chronicler in the 16th century, there were some 600 fountains in Fes alone. Well-known examples in Morocco include the Nejjarine Fountain in Fes, the Shrob ou Shouf Fountain in Marrakesh, and the Mouassine Fountain attached to the mosque of the same name.  Water supply infrastructure  khettara emerging at the surface near Rissani (Tafilalt region)alt= Moroccan cities and towns were supplied with water through a number of different mechanisms. As elsewhere, most settlements were built near existing water sources such as rivers and oases. However, further engineering was necessary in order to supplement natural sources and in order to distribute the water across the city directly. In Fes, for example, this was accomplished via a complex network of canals and channels which captured the waters of the Oued Fes (Fes River) and distributed them across the entire city. These water channels (most of them now hidden under buildings) supplied houses, gardens, fountains, and mosques, powered norias (waterwheels), and sustained certain industries such as the tanneries (e.g. the famous Chouara Tannery). Waterwheels were also used to lift water from these canals and into aqueducts to bring them even further, such as the enormous noria, with a diameter of 26 meters, built by the Marinids to supply their Royal Gardens to the north of Fes el-Jdid. Marrakesh, located in a more arid environment, was supplied in large part by a system of khettaras, an ingenious and complex system by which an underground channel was dug beneath the slopes in the surrounding countryside until it reached the level of the phreatic zone. This artificial channel was gently sloped to allow water to drain through it, but was sloped less steeply than the natural terrain so that it eventually emerged at the surface. In this way, the khettaras drew water from underground aquifers located on higher ground and brought them to the surface with the use of gravity alone. Once at the surface, the waters ran along canals and were stored in a cistern or water basin, from which they could then be redistributed across the city. This system was created under the Almoravids (who founded the city) and further developed and maintained by their successors. Oases regions in the desertic areas of Morocco also needed to make extensive use of irrigation and artificial water canals to make agriculture possible. Khettara systems were also used to supplement these water sources, especially as surface waters frequently dried up during the summer months. The Tafilalt oasis region, located along the Ziz River valley, is a notable example of this system. = Domestic architecture =  Riads  A riad garden in the 19th-century Bahia Palace of Marrakesh A riad (sometimes spelled riyad; ) is an interior garden found in many Moroccan mansions and palaces. It is normally rectangular and divided into four parts along its central axes, with a fountain at its middle. Riad gardens probably originated in Persian architecture (where it is also known as chahar bagh) and became a prominent feature in Moorish palaces in Spain (such Madinat al-Zahra, the Aljaferia and the Alhambra). In Morocco, they became especially widespread in the palaces and mansions of Marrakesh, where the combination of available space and warm climate made them particularly appealing. The term is nowadays applied in a broader way to traditional Moroccan houses that have been converted into hotels and tourist guesthouses.  Houses  Dar Seffarine, one of many restored historic houses in Fes Traditional Moroccan houses were typically centered around a main courtyard, sometimes surrounded by a gallery, from which other rooms and sections branched off. Courtyard houses have historical antecedents in the houses and villas of the Greco-Roman Mediterranean world and even earlier in the ancient Middle East. Moroccan houses, even rich mansions, are usually completely unadorned on the outside, with all decoration concentrated on the inside. As with other types of structures, decoration included carved stucco, sculpted and painted wood, and zellij tilework. A number of historic bourgeois mansions have survived across the country, mostly from the Alaouite era but some dating as far back as the Marinid or Saadian periods.  Palaces  Royal Palace (Dar al-Makhzen) in Rabat Sultans and caliphs, as well as the more powerful and wealthy government ministers in the 19th and 20th century, were able to build extensive palaces. The Dar al-Makhzen (meaning roughly \\"House/Abode of the Government\\") referred to the royal palace and center of government in a number of cities, such as the Dar al-Makhzen in Fes, Rabat, Tangier, Meknes, or Marrakesh. These palaces are still generally off-limit to most visitors today. However, royal palaces generally had a mechouar, a large walled square which acted as a ceremonial space or parade ground at the entrance of the palace. These squares were accessible to the public and formed the public facade of the ruler's abode, sometimes overlooked by monumental and well-decorated gates leading to the palace grounds (e.g. Bab Mansour in Meknes). The mechouars of Fes el-Jdid are examples of these, as was the vast square known today as Place el-Hedim in Meknes. The palaces themselves typically consisted of many structures and pavilions arranged around a series of courtyards, pleasure gardens, and riads. This resulted in palace complexes with a sprawling layout; in some cases this was a consequence of multiple phases of construction taking place in different periods. These palaces often also included a number of normally public facilities such as bathhouses and mosques, thus practically making them self-sufficient and self-contained royal cities. Sultans also built additional outlying palaces and pavilions such as the Dar Batha in Fes, as well as vast gardens on the outskirts of their capital city such as the Agdal Garden in Marrakesh and the former Mosara Garden in Fes. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, grand viziers and other high officials of the government were able to accumulate enough power and wealth to build their own private palaces for themselves and their households. Examples of these include the Bahia Palace of Ba Ahmed (which was later taken over by the sultan), the Dar al Bacha and Dar Si Said in Marrakesh, the Dar Moqri and Dar Glaoui in Fes, and the Dar Mnebbhi in Fes and its counterpart in Marrakesh. Other local warlords and magnates were also sometimes capable of building their own lavish palaces, such as the Palace of Raissouli in Asilah. The Kasbah of Telouet, also built by the Glaoui clan and only partly preserved today, is another notable example of a 20th-century palace constructed with traditional methods, but located in a rural mountain town. = Military architecture = The Almohad gate of the Kasbah of the Udayas in Rabat The Almohad-era walls of Rabat  City walls  Defensive city walls were generally built out of rammed earth and consisted of a wall topped by a walkway for soldiers, reinforced at regular intervals by square bastion towers. These walls were characteristically crowned by merlons shaped like square blocks topped by pyramidal caps. Major examples of such fortifications still stand in Marrakesh, Fes, Rabat, and other cities. The defensive walls constructed in Muslim al-Andalus also shared this general form, examples of which have survived in Cordoba, Seville, and Granada.  City gates  A complex bent passage in the Bab Debbagh gate of Marrakesh As in medieval fortifications elsewhere in the world, Moroccan city walls were pierced with a number of gates to grant access in and out of the city. As these were often the weakest points of a defensive wall, they were usually more heavily fortified than the surrounding wall. Most medieval Moroccan gates had a bent entrance: their passage made sharp right-angle turns once or multiple times in order to slow down any attackers. They ranged from very plain in appearance to highly monumental and ornamental. Many of the most monumental gates still standing today were built in stone during the Almohad period, including Bab Agnaou in Marrakesh and the gate of the Udayas Kasbah in Rabat. As the defensive function of city walls and gates became less relevant in the modern era, gates became more ornamental and symbolic structures, like the Bab Bou Jeloud gate built in Fes in 1913. Entrance to the Kasbah of Tangier  Kasbahs  The term Kasbah () in Morocco generally refers to a fortified enclosure, ranging from small garrison forts to vast walled districts which functioned as the citadel and center of government in the city (such as the Kasbah of Marrakesh or the Kasbah of Tangier). \\"Kasbah\\" can also refer to various fortresses or fortified mansions in the Atlas Mountains and the desert oases regions of Morocco, such as the Kasbah Telouet, Tamnougalt, or Kasbah Taourirt in Ouarzazate.  Forts and other fortifications (borj, sqala, and ribat)  The Sqala of the Port in Essaouira A borj () generally referred to a single fort, tower, or bastion, such as the Borj Nord in Fes. A sqala () was another type of bastion, often a seaside fortification with a platform for canons, like the Sqala of Essaouira or that of the Udayas Kasbah in Rabat. A ribat () usually referred to a countryside or frontier fortress ostensibly used by warriors fighting waging jihad on the edge of Islamic territory, though it also referred to a type of fortified \\"monastery\\" or spiritual retreat for Sufi adherents, not unlike a zawiya. A notable example, from an architectural point of view, is the Ribat of Tit south of El Jadida, which was originally constructed by one family in the 12th century. (Also notably, the name of the city of Rabat derives from its original name Ribat al-Fath.)  Agadirs  agadir in the Anti-Atlas region of Morocco Agadirs were fortified granaries typically found in the desert, mountain, and oases regions of southern and eastern Morocco. They are one of the architectural types associated in particular with Berber architecture in North Africa.  Constructions methods and materials  = Rammed earth (pis√©) = General example of rammed earth (pis√©) wall being built (with metal instead of wooden scaffolding). pis√© wall in Fes el-Balialt= One of the most common types of construction in Morocco, especially for city walls, was rammed earth, an ancient building technique found across the Near East, Africa, and beyond.\\"Pis√©\\", in The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, 5th edition (1998). p.439 It is also known as \\"pis√©\\" (from French) or \\"tabia\\" (from Arabic). The ramparts of Fes, Marrakesh, and Rabat, for example, were made with this process, even though some notable structures (like monumental gates) were also built in stone. It generally made use of local materials and was widely used thanks to its low cost and relative efficiency. This material consisted of mud and soil of varying consistency (everything from smooth clay to rocky soil) usually mixed with other materials such as straw or lime to aid adhesion. The addition of lime also made the walls harder and more resistant overall, although this varied locally as some areas had soil which hardened well on its own while others did not. (For example, the walls of Fes and nearby Meknes contain up to 47% lime versus around 17% in Marrakesh and 12% in Rabat.) The technique is still in use today, though the composition and ratio of these materials has continued to change over time as some materials (like clay) have become relatively more costly than others (like gravel). The walls were built from bottom to top one level at a time. Workers pressed and packed in the materials into sections ranging from 50 and 70 cm in length that were each held together temporarily by wooden boards. Once the material was settled, the wooden restraints could be removed and the process was repeated on top of the previously completed level. This process of initial wooden scaffolding often leaves traces in the form of multiple rows of little holes visible across the face of the walls. In many cases walls were covered with a coating of lime, stucco, or other material to give them a smooth surface and to better protect the main structure. This type of construction required consistent maintenance and upkeep, as the materials are relatively permeable and are more easily eroded by rain over time; in parts of Morocco, (especially near the Sahara) kasbahs and other structures made with a less durable composition (typically lacking lime) can begin to crumble apart in less than a couple of decades after they've been abandoned. As such, old structures of this type remain intact only insofar as they are continuously restored; some stretches of wall today appear brand new due to regular maintenance, while others are crumbling. = Brick and stone = Kutubiyya minaret: the use of rubble masonry is visible, as are the faint remains of plaster, with painted decoration, which once covered it. In addition to rammed earth, brick and (especially in desert regions) mudbrick were also common types of materials for the construction of houses, civic architecture, and mosques. Many medieval minarets, for example, are made in brick, in many cases covered with other materials for decoration. Stone masonry was also used in many notable monuments, especially in the Almohad period. The monumental Almohad gates of Bab Agnaou, Bab er-Rouah, and the main gate of the Udayas Kasbah (Bab Oudaia) made extensive use of carved stone. The major Almohad minarets of the same period demonstrate the relative variability in construction material and methods, depending on the region and the demands of the structure: the minaret of the Kutubiyya Mosque is built in rubble masonry using sandstone, the Giralda of Seville (in Spain) was made in local brick, the massive but unfinished Hassan Tower in Rabat was made in stone, and the minaret of the Kasbah Mosque in Marrakesh was made with a base of rubble stone and a main shaft of brick. = Wood = Mosque of Abu al-Hasan in Fes Wood was also extensively used, but mostly for ceilings and other elements above eye level such as canopies and upper galleries. Many buildings such as mosques and mausoleums have sloped wood-frame ceilings, visually enhanced by the use of geometric patterns in their arrangement, sculpting, and painted decoration. Many doorways, street fountains, and mosque entrances are also highlighted with sculpted wood canopies which were characteristic of Moroccan and Moorish architecture. Especially from the Marinid period onward, sculpted wood became a major component of architectural decoration. Wood generally came from Moroccan cedar trees, still highly valued today, which once grew abundantly on mountain slopes across the country but are now partly endangered and limited to forests of the Middle Atlas. Other types of wood were still occasionally used, however. The sculpted wood canopy of the Shrob ou Shouf Fountain in Marrakesh was made of palm wood, for example. The famous Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque, which was fabricated in Cordoba (Spain) before being shipped to Marrakesh, was made primarily of cedar wood but its marquetry decoration was enhanced with more exotic woods of different colors such as jujube and African blackwood. = Other materials for decoration = calligraphic decoration in the Bou Inania Madrasa of Fes Close-up of the 12th-century bronze overlays on Bab al-Gna'iz, one of the doorways of the Qarawiyyin Mosque A very prominent and distinctive element of Moroccan and Moorish architecture is its heavy use of stucco for carved and sculpted decoration across walls and ceilings. Stucco, which is relatively cheap and easily sculpted, was carved and painted with motifs from a large repertoire including floral and vegetal motifs (arabesques), geometric patterns, calligraphic compositions, and muqarnas forms. (These were also common features in sculpted wood decoration.) Tilework, particularly in the form of mosaic tilework called zellij, was a standard decorative element along lower walls and for the paving of floors. It consisted of hand-cut pieces of faience in different colours fitted together to form elaborate geometric motifs, often based on radiating star patterns. Zellij made its appearance in the region during the 10th century and became widespread by the 14th century during the Marinid period. It may have been inspired or derived from Byzantine mosaics and then adapted by Muslim craftsmen for faience tiles. The tiles are first fabricated in glazed squares, typically 10 cm per side, then cut by hand into a variety of pre-established shapes (usually memorized by heart) necessary to form the overall pattern. This pre-established repertoire of shapes combined to generate a variety of complex patterns is also known as the hasba method.Aboufadil, Y., Thalal, A., & Raghni, M. (2013). \\"Symmetry groups of Moroccan geometric woodwork patterns\\". Journal of Applied Crystallography, 46, 1‚Äì8. Although the exact patterns vary from case to case, the underlying principles have been constant for centuries and Moroccan craftsmen are still adept at making them today.Aboufadil, Y., Thalal, A., & Raghni, M. (2013). \\"Symmetry groups of Moroccan geometric woodwork patterns\\". Journal of Applied Crystallography, 46, 1‚Äì8. Metal, particularly bronze and copper, was also used to decorate or protect certain elements. Notably, the doors of many medieval mosques and madrasas were covered with bronze or copper plating which was carved and chiseled with geometric, arabesque, and calligraphic motifs. The oldest surviving bronze artworks in Moorish-Moroccan art, for example, are the 12th- century bronze fittings found on several doors of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fes.  Architectural forms and decorative motifs  = Arches =  Horseshoe arch  Perhaps the most characteristic arch type of Moroccan and western Islamic architecture generally is the so-called \\"Moorish\\" or \\"horseshoe\\" arch. This is an arch where the curves of the arch continue downward past the horizontal middle axis of the circle and begin to curve towards each other, rather than just being semi-circular (forming half a circle only). This arch profile became nearly ubiquitous in the region from the very beginning of the Islamic period. The origin of this arch appear to date back to the preceding Byzantine period across the Mediterranean, as versions of it appear in Byzantine-era buildings in Cappadocia, Armenia, and Syria. They also appear frequently in Visigothic churches in the Iberian peninsula (5th-7th centuries). Perhaps due to this Visigothic influence, horseshoe arches were particularly predominant afterwards in al-Andalus under the Umayyads of Cordoba, although the Andalusi arch was of slightly different profile than the Visigothic arch. Arches were not only used for supporting the weight of the structure above them. Blind arches and arched niches were also used as decorative elements. The mihrab (niche symbolizing the qibla) of a mosque was almost invariably in the shape of horseshoe arch. Starting in the Almoravid period, the first pointed or \\"broken\\" horseshoe arches began to appear in the region and became more widespread during the Almohad period. This arch is likely of North African origin, since pointed arches were already present in earlier Fatimid architecture further east.  Polylobed arch  Polylobed (or multifoil) arches, have their earliest precedents in Fatimid architecture in Ifriqiya and Egypt and had also appeared in Andalusi architecture such as the Aljaferia palace. In the Almoravid and Almohad periods, this type of arch was further refined for decorative functions while horseshoe arches continued to be standard elsewhere. It appears in the Great Mosque of Tlemcen (in Algeria) and the Mosque of Tinmal. File:Almoravid Koubba IMG 3233.jpgPolylobed arches at the Almoravid Qubba in Marrakesh File:Tin Mal Moschee 03.jpgA polylobed arch in the Mosque of Tinmal  \\"Lambrequin\\" arch  The so-called \\"lambrequin\\" arch, with a more intricate profile of lobes and points, was also introduced in the Almoravid period, with an early appearance in the funerary section of the Qarawiyyin Mosque dating from the early 12th century. It then became common in subsequent Almohad and Marinid architecture (as well as Nasrid architecture in Spain), often to highlight the arches near the mihrab area of a mosque. This type of arch is also sometimes referred to as a \\"muqarnas\\" arch due to its similarities with a muqarnas profile and because of its speculated derivation from the use of muqarnas itself. This type of arch was indeed commonly used with muqarnas sculpting along the intrados (inside surfaces) of the arch. File:Tinmal mosque arches DSCF8505.jpgLambrequin arches in the Mosque of Tinmal File:Al-Attarine Madrasa DSCF3633 (R Prazeres).jpgA lambrequin arch with muqarnas in the Madrasa al-Attarine, Fes = Surface decoration =  Floral and vegetal motifs  Arabesques, or floral and vegetal motifs, derive from a long tradition of similar motifs in Syrian, Hellenistic, and Roman architectural ornamentation. Early arabesque motifs in Umayyad Cordoba, such as those seen at the Great Mosque or Madinat al-Zahra, continued to make use of acanthus leaves and grapevine motifs from this Hellenistic tradition. Almoravid and Almohad architecture made more use of a general striated leaf motif, often curling and splitting into unequal parts along an axis of symmetry. Palmettes and, to a lesser extent, seashell and pine cone images were also featured. In the late 16th century, Saadian architecture sometimes made use of a mandorla- type (or almond-shaped) motif which may have been of Ottoman influence. File:Chellah gate detail DSCF6947.jpgArabesque motifs and a palmette image carved into the spandrel of the Marinid gate at Chellah, Rabat File:Ben youssef madrasa mihrab decoration detail DSCF9478.jpgArabesque and pine cone motifs along with Kufic inscriptions around the Ben Youssef Madrasa's mihrab, in Marrakesh File:Al-attarine madrasa decoration detail DSCF3687.jpgArabesques carved in stucco over an archway in the al-Attarine Madrasa in Fes  \\"Interlacing\\" motifs (sebka and darj wa ktaf)  Various types of interlacing lozenge-like motifs are heavily featured on the surface of minarets starting in the Almohad period (12th-13th centuries) and are later found in other decoration such as carved stucco along walls in Marinid (and Nasrid) architecture, eventually becoming a standard feature in the Moroccan ornamental repertoire in combination with arabesques. This motif, typically called sebka (meaning \\"net\\"), is believed by some scholars to have originated with the large interlacing arches in the 10th-century extension of the Great Mosque of Cordoba by Caliph al-Hakam II. It was then miniaturized and widened into a repeating net-like pattern that can cover surfaces. This motif, in turn, had many detailed variations. One common version, called darj wa ktaf (\\"step and shoulder\\") by Moroccan craftsmen, makes use of alternating straight and curved lines which cross each other on their symmetrical axes, forming a motif that looks roughly like a fleur-de-lys or palmette shape. Another version, also commonly found on minarets in alternation with the darj wa ktaf, consists of interlacing multifoil/polylobed arches which form a repeating partial trefoil shape.

These are found in carved stucco and wood decoration, and most notably in zellij mosaic tilework. Other polygon motifs are also found, often in combination with arabesques.

Arabic calligraphy, as in other parts of the Muslim world, was also an art form. Many buildings had foundation inscriptions which record the date of their construction and the patron who sponsored it. Inscriptions could also feature Qur'anic verses, exhortations of God, and other religiously significant passages. Early inscriptions were generally written in the Kufic script, a style where letters were written with straight lines and had fewer flourishes. At a slightly later period, mainly in the 11th century, Kufic letters were enhanced with ornamentation, particularly to fill the empty spaces that were usually present above the letters. This resulted in the addition of floral forms or arabesque backgrounds to calligraphic compositions. In the 12th century a more \\"cursive\\" script began to appear, though it only became commonplace in monuments from the Marinid period (13th-14th century) onward. Kufic was still employed, especially for more formal or solemn inscriptions such as religious content. By contrast, Kufic script was also used in a more strictly decorative form, as the starting point for an interlacing motif that was could be woven into a larger arabesque background.

This technique originated further east in Iran before spreading across the Muslim world. It was first introduced into Morocco by the Almoravids, who made early use of it in early 12th century in the Qubba Ba'adiyyin in Marrakesh and in the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fes. While the earliest forms of muqarnas in Islamic architecture were used as squinches or pendentives at the corners of domes, they were quickly adapted to other architectural uses. In the western Islamic world they were particularly dynamic and were used, among other examples, to enhance entire vaulted ceilings, fill in certain vertical transitions between different architectural elements, and event to highlight the presence of windows on otherwise flat surfaces.

Xlib (also known as libX11) is an X Window System protocol client library written in the C programming language. It contains functions for interacting with an X server. These functions allow programmers to write programs without knowing the details of the protocol. Few applications use Xlib directly; rather, they employ other libraries that use Xlib functions to provide widget toolkits: * X Toolkit Intrinsics (Xt) * Athena widget set (Xaw) * Motif * FLTK * GTK * Qt (X11 version) * Tk * SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) * SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) Xlib appeared around 1985, and is currently used in GUIs for many Unix-like operating systems. The XCB library is an attempt to replace Xlib. While Xlib is still used in some environments, modern versions of the X.org server implement Xlib on top of XCB. Data types The main types of data in Xlib are the \`Display\` structure and the types of the identifiers. Informally, a display is a physical or virtual device where graphical operations are done. The \`Display\` structure of the Xlib library contains information about the display, but more importantly it contains information relative to the channel between the client and the server. For example, in a Unix-like operating system, the \`Display\` structure contains the file handle of the socket of this channel (this can be retrieved using the \`ConnectionNumber\` macro.) Most Xlib functions have a \`Display\` structure as an argument because they either operate on the channel or are relative to a specific channel. In particular, all Xlib functions that interact with the server need this structure for accessing the channel. Some other functions need this structure, even if they operate locally, because they operate on data relative to a specific channel. Operations of this kind include for example operations on the event queue, which is described below. Windows, colormaps, etc. are managed by the server, which means that the data about their actual implementation is all stored in the server. The client operates on these objects by using their identifiers. The client cannot directly operate on an object, but can only request the server to perform the operation specifying the identifier of the object. The types \`Windows\`, \`Pixmap\`, \`Font\`, \`Colormap\`, etc. are all identifiers, which are 32-bit integers (just as in the X11 protocol itself). A client 'creates' a window by requesting that the server create a window. This is done via a call to an Xlib function that returns an identifier for the window, that is, a number. This identifier can then be used by the client for requesting other operations on the same window to the server. The identifiers are unique to the server. Most of them can be used by different applications to refer to the same objects. For example, two applications connecting with the same server use the same identifier to refer to the same window. These two applications use two different channels, and therefore have two different \`Display\` structures; however, when they request operations on the same identifier, these operations will be done on the same object. Protocol and events The Xlib functions that send requests to the server usually do not send these requests immediately but store them in a buffer, called the request buffer. The term request in this case refers to the request from the client that is directed to the server: the request buffer can contain all kinds of requests to the server, not only those having a visible effect on the screen. The request buffer is guaranteed to be flushed (i.e., all requests done so far are sent to the server) after a call to the functions \`XSync\` or \`XFlush\`, after a call to a function that returns a value from the server (these functions block until the answer is received), and in some other conditions. Xlib stores the received events in a queue. The client application can inspect and retrieve events from the queue. While the X server sends events asynchronously, applications using the Xlib library are required to explicitly call Xlib functions for accessing the events in the queue. Some of these functions may block; in this case, they also flush the request buffer. Errors are instead received and treated asynchronously: the application can provide an error handler that will be called whenever an error message from the server is received. The content of a window is not guaranteed to be preserved if the window or one of its parts are made not visible. In this case, the application are sent an \`Expose\` event when the window of one part of it is made visible again. The application is then supposed to draw the window content again. Functions The functions in the Xlib library can be grouped in: # operations on the connection (\`XOpenDisplay\`, \`XCloseDisplay\`, ...); # requests to the server, including requests for operations (\`XCreateWindow\`, \`XCreateGC\`,...) and requests for information (\`XGetWindowProperty\`, ...); and # operations that are local to the client: operations on the event queue (\`XNextEvent\`, \`XPeekEvent\`, ...) and other operations on local data (\`XLookupKeysym\`, \`XParseGeometry\`, \`XSetRegion\`, \`XCreateImage\`, \`XSaveContext\`, ...) Example Simple Xlib application drawing a box and text in a window. Without window manager decorations. Simple Xlib application drawing a box and text in a window. With IceWM window manager decorations. The following program creates a window with a little black square in it: /* Simple Xlib application for creating a window and drawing a box in it. gcc input.c -o output -lX11 */ #include #include #include #include int main(void) { Display *display; Window window; XEvent event; char *msg = \\"Hello, World!\\"; int s; // open connection to the server display = XOpenDisplay(NULL); if (display  NULL) { fprintf(stderr, \\"Cannot open display \\"); exit(1); } s = DefaultScreen(display); // create window window = XCreateSimpleWindow(display, RootWindow(display, s), 10, 10, 200, 200, 1, BlackPixel(display, s), WhitePixel(display, s)); // select kind of events we are interested in XSelectInput(display, window, ExposureMask  KeyPressMask); // map (show) the window XMapWindow(display, window); // event loop for (;;) { XNextEvent(display, &event;); // draw or redraw the window if (event.type  Expose) { XFillRectangle(display, window, DefaultGC(display, s), 20, 20, 10, 10); XDrawString(display, window, DefaultGC(display, s), 50, 50, msg, strlen(msg)); } // exit on key press if (event.type  KeyPress) break; } // close connection to the server XCloseDisplay(display); return 0; } The client creates a connection with the server by calling \`XOpenDisplay\`. It then requests the creation of a window with \`XCreateSimpleWindow\`. A separate call to \`XMapWindow\` is necessary for mapping the window, that is, for making it visible on the screen. The square is drawn by calling \`XFillRectangle\`. This operation can only be performed after the window is created. However, performing it once may not be enough. Indeed, the content of the window is not always guaranteed to be preserved. For example, if the window is covered and then uncovered again, its content might require being redrawn. The program is informed that the window or a part of it has to be drawn by the reception of an \`Expose\` event. The drawing of the window content is therefore made inside the loop handling the events. Before entering this loop, the events the application is interested in are selected, in this case with \`XSelectInput\`. The event loop waits for an incoming event: if this event is a key press, the application exits; if it is an expose event, the window content is drawn. The function \`XNextEvent\` blocks and flushes the request buffer if there is no event in the queue. Other libraries Xlib does not provide support for buttons, menus, scrollbars, etc. Such widgets are provided by other libraries, which in turn use Xlib. There are two kinds of such libraries: * libraries built atop of the X Toolkit Intrinsics library (Xt), which provides support for widgets but does not provide any particular widget; specific widgets are provided by widget set libraries that use Xt, such as Xaw and Motif; * libraries that provide widget sets using Xlib directly, without the Xt library, such as the X versions of GTK, Qt, FLTK and fpGUI. Applications using any of these widget libraries typically specify the content of the window before entering the main loop and do not need to explicitly handle \`Expose\` events and redraw the window content. The XCB library is an alternative to Xlib. Its two main aims are: reduction in library size and direct access to the X11 protocol.

Early life  Named after Shakespeare's Cymbeline heroine, she was born in Woking, Surrey, to a family of artists and businessmen. Her grandfather, John Hassall, and her aunt, Joan Hassall, worked as illustrators, while her father, Christopher Hassall, was a poet and lyricist. She had a brother. Her godfather is said to have been the composer Ivor Novello, with whom her father had worked extensively as lyricist. Yet on occasion Imogen would proudly claim that this distinction was Sir William Walton's with whom her father had collaborated in the early 1950s, denied by Lady Walton.Page 71, Biography: Leissner, D. (2002)  Career  Imogen boarded and attended Elmhurst Ballet School, Camberley 1952‚Äì1954 and the Royal Ballet School, White Lodge, Richmond Park 1955‚Äì1958. Later in 1958 (aged 16) she studied in New York City, then returned to live with family in the Vale of Health by Hampstead Heath, London. She continued her absorption of the theatre mode with study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art 1960‚Äì1962, following which she joined the company of the Royal Shakespeare Company for one season.Biography: Leissner, D. (2002) After enjoying an appearance in the William Douglas-Home comedy \\"The Reluctant Peer\\" at the Duchess Theatre in 1964, she appeared in British TV adventure series of the 1960s such as The Saint, The Avengers and The Persuaders! In her first significant film role, she played Tara in The Long Duel (1967). She gained further public notice as a dominant cave-girl in When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth (1970) and played major roles in Carry On Loving and the cult horror film Incense for the Damned the same year. In 1973, she appeared in White Cargo alongside David Jason.  Personal life  Hassall was married to actor Kenneth Ives, and before they were married, they had a daughter called Melanie Ives Hassall, who died four days after being born in 1972.Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries, pp. 315‚Äì316  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qAhtNiAl3YsC&pg;=PA315 She was briefly married to Andrew Knox (an actor who appeared in Doctor on the Go and who later committed suicide in 1987)Andrew Knox ‚Äì biography, IMDb  https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461475/bio but they separated after a few months of marriage, and she lost the baby she was expecting.Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries, pp. 315‚Äì316  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qAhtNiAl3YsC&pg;=PA315 Hassall's private life was a regular subject of interest in tabloid newspapers. She was known for playing sexy, scantily clad characters in film and on TV. This, and the revealing outfits she wore at film premieres, resulted in her being referred to as the \\"Countess of Cleavage\\".A defining picture of the \\"Countess of Cleavage\\" enjoying the flash-bulbs at a premiere  http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/12th-march-1970-the-film-star-imogen- hassall-in-a-revealing-dress-picture-id3268681?s=594x594  Death  After her failed relationships, the death of her child, her miscarriage, and her career decline, she became depressed. Following previous suicide attempts, she was found dead in her Wimbledon home on the morning of 16 November 1980, when she failed to meet a friend, the actress Suzanna Leigh, with whom she was due to go on holiday to Mombasa that day. She had apparently committed suicide by overdosing on Tuinal tablets.Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries, pp. 315‚Äì316  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qAhtNiAl3YsC&pg;=PA315 She was interred in Gap Road Cemetery, Wimbledon, London.Imogen Hassall ‚Äì Find A Grave  https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20195548  Portrayal on stage and TV  Her appearance in the film Carry On Loving (1970) led many years later to her being portrayed as a character in the play Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick written by Terry Johnson. The play was produced at the Royal National Theatre in September 1998 and received the Olivier Award 1999 for Best New Comedy. Hassall was played by Gina Bellman. Johnson later adapted the play for a 2000 television film Cor, Blimey!, although the character of Hassall does not appear in the television version, which was much changed by Johnson from his original play.

Additions can include salsa, refried beans, sour cream, onion, rice, or jalape√±os. There are many variations and alternative names used by region. Frito pie can be prepared in a casserole dish, but an alternate preparation can be in a single- serve Fritos-type corn chip bag with various ingredients as toppings. In Mexico, a similar type of dish is chilaquiles. History The exact origin of the frito pie is not completely clear. It is believed that it was created somewhere in Mexico and was popular at fiestas before it took off in other countries like the United States. The oldest known recipe using Fritos brand corn chips with chili was published in Texas in 1949. The recipe may have been invented by Daisy Doolin, the mother of the founder of the Frito Corporation (Doolin) and the first person to use Fritos as an ingredient in cooking, or by Mary Livingston, Doolin's executive secretary. The Frito-Lay company attributes the recipe to Nell Morris, who joined Frito-Lay in the 1950s and helped develop an official cookbook which included the Frito pie. Doolin and his Frito Corporation were early investors in Disneyland, which opened Casa de Fritos restaurant in Disneyland in 1955. \\"Frito Chili Pie\\" appears on the 1950s menu. Another story claims that true Frito pie originated only in the 1960s with Teresa Hern√°ndez, who worked at the F. W. Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Her Frito pie used homemade red chile con carne with cheddar cheese and onions, and was served in the bag, which was thicker in the 1960s than it is now. Preparation Frito pie is a simple dish: At its most basic, it is just an amount of Fritos corn chips with beef chili as a topping. It was historically served by some right inside the chip bag, which is split down the middle; toppings typically include shredded cheese and chopped raw onion, and may also include additional items like sour cream and jalape√±os. Variations =Frito boats and walking tacos= Frito Pies are sometimes referred to by the name walking taco or Frito boat, and can be made in a small, single-serving bag of corn chips, with chili, taco meat, garbanzos, pork rinds, pepitas, and many other varied ingredients, poured over the top. The combination can be finished with grated cheese, onions, jalape√±os, lettuce, and sour cream, known as a Frito boat or walking taco in the Midwestern United States. In the Ohio Valley region, this preparation is commonly called taco-in-a-bag. (\\"Walking taco\\" or \\"traveling taco\\", however, is the more widespread term at least in the Midwest). In many parts of Southern California, they are known as \\"pepper bellies.\\" Frito pies are popular at sports venues, fundraisers, bingos, open houses, state fairs and street vendors. The term Tostiloco comes from Tijuana, and is found in California. Another term is Doriloco, after Doritos. =Tostilocos= In Mexico, a version of the dish is known as tostilocos (\\"crazy chips\\").

It inserts into root cementum one side and onto alveolar bone on the other.  Structure  The PDL consists of principal fibres, loose connective tissue, blast and clast cells, oxytalan fibres and Cell Rest of Malassez.Max A. Listgarten, University of Pennsylvania and Temple University, It is the different composition of collagens which give various ECM functions and abilities. There is a mixture of thick and thin fibres in the PDL. It is important to note that, in reality, the fibres are not as defined as these classifications. http://www.dental.pitt.edu/informatics/periohistology/en/gu0404.htm Alveolodental ligament The main principal fiber group is the alveolodental ligament, which consists of five fiber subgroups: alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, apical, and interradicular on multirooted teeth. Principal fibers other than the alveolodental ligament are the transseptal fibers. All these fibers help the tooth withstand the naturally substantial compressive forces which occur during chewing and remain embedded in the bone. The ends of the principal fibers that are within either cementum or alveolar bone proper are considered Sharpey fibers. * Alveolar crest fibers (I) run from the cervical part of the root to the alveolar bone crest *Horizontal fibers (J) attach to the cementum apical to the alveolar crest fibers and run perpendicularly from the root of the tooth to the alveolar bone.. *Oblique fibers (K) are the most numerous fibers in the periodontal ligament, running from cementum in an oblique direction to insert into bone coronally. These fibres resist vertical & intrusive forces *Apical fibers are found radiating from cementum around the apex of the root to the bone, forming base of the socket or alveolus. *Interradicular fibers are only found between the roots of multirooted teeth, such as premolars and molars. They extend from radicular cementum to interradicular alveolar bone. = Transseptal fibers = Transseptal fibers (H) extend interproximally over the alveolar bone crest and are embedded in the cementum of adjacent teeth; they form an interdental ligament. These fibers keep all the teeth aligned. These fibers may be considered as belonging to the gingival tissue because they do not have an osseous attachment.Ten Cate's Oral Histolog, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 274 =Loose connective tissue= Loose connective tissue contains fibres, extracellular matrix, cells, nerves and blood vessels. The extracellular compartment consists of Type 1, 3, and 5 collagen fibers bundles embedded in intercellular substance. The PDL collagen fibers are categorized according to their orientation and location along the tooth. The cells include fibroblast, defence cells and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. =Cell Rest of Malassez= These groups of epithelial cells become located in the mature PDL after the disintegration of Hertwig epithelial root sheath during the formation of the root.[2]They form a plexus which surrounds the tooth. Cell Rests of Malassez might proliferate during inflammation which may lead to lead to radicular cyst formation in later life. =Oxytalan fibres= Oxytalan fibres are unique to the PDL and are elastic in nature. It inserts into cementum and runs in 2 directions; parallel to root surface and oblique to root surface. The function is thought to maintain the patency of blood vessels during occlusal loading. Further research is needed to determine the function of oxytalan fibres.The oxytalan fibre network in the periodontium and its possible mechanical function Archives of Oral Biology, Volume 57, Issue 8, Pages 1003-1011 Hardus Strydom, Jaap C. Maltha, Anne M. Kuijpers-Jagtman, Johannes W. Von den Hoff Help Composition The PDL substance has been estimated to be 70% water, which is thought to have a significant effect on the tooth's ability to withstand stress loads. The completeness and vitality of the PDL are essential for the functioning of the tooth. The PDL ranges in width from 0.15 to 0.38mm with its thinnest part located in the middle third of the root.[5] The width progressively decreases with age. The PDL is a part of the periodontium that provides for the attachment of the teeth to the surrounding alveolar bone by way of the cementum. The PDL appears as the periodontal space of 0.4 to 1.5 mm on radiographs, a radiolucent area between the radiopaque lamina dura of the alveolar bone proper and the radiopaque cementum. Development PDL cells are one of the many cells derived from the dental follicle and this occurs after crown formation is completed and when the roots start developing. These cells will remodel the dental follicle to form the PDL.Yao S, Pan F, Prpic V, Wise GE. Differentiation of stem cells in the dental follicle. J Dent Res. 2008;87:767-771.

PDL fibres also provide a role in load transfer between the teeth and alveolar bone. (PDL fibres absorb and transmit forces between teeth and alveolar bone. It acts as an effective support during the masticatory function.)McCormack SW, Witzel U, Watson PJ, Fagan MJ, Gr√∂ning F.

Periodontal mechanoreceptors are present in pdl. They will transmit information about the stimulated tooth, direction and amplitude of forces.Trulsson, M. (2006). Sensory-motor function of human periodontal mechanoreceptors*. Journal of Oral Rehabilitation, 33(4), 262-273. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2842.2006.01629.x =Nutritive= It maintains the vitality of the surrounding cells. (PDL is heavily anastomosed). There are 3 principal sources of blood vessels which are apical vessels, perforating vessels and gingival vessels. Apical vessels originate from vessels that supply the pulp. Perforating vessels originates from lamina dura and the vessels perforate the socket wall (cribriform plate). Gingival vessels are derived from the gingival tissue. Outer layers of blood supply in PDL may help in mechanical suspension and support of the tooth while inner layers of blood vessels supply surrounding PDL tissues.Institute of Anatomy, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Bischofsholer Damm 15, D-30173 Hannover, Germany =Remodeling= There are progenitor cells in the periodontal ligament that can differentiate into osteoblasts for the physiological maintenance of alveolar bone and, most likely, for its repair as well. Clinical significance = Injury= * When traumatic forces of occlusion are placed on a tooth, the PDL widens to take the extra forces. Thus, early occlusal trauma can be viewed on radiographs as a widening of the periodontal ligament space. Thickening of the lamina dura in response is also possible. Clinically, occlusal trauma is noted by the late manifestation of increased mobility of the tooth and possibly the presence of pathological tooth migration. * Damage to the PDL may result in tooth ankylosis to the jawbone, making the tooth lose its continuous eruption ability. Dental trauma, such as subluxation, may cause tearing of the PDL and pain during function (eating). * The PDL cells of an avulsed tooth is at risk of drying and desiccation if left in dry storage. Wet storage in an isotonic liquid, although a superior method to dry storage, can preserve PDL vitality depending on the medium but not for an indefinite period of time. All of these can lead to loss of vitality of the PDL and depending on the duration of storage, this can affect the success of subsequent replantation. = Disease= * The epithelial rests of Malassez can become cystic, usually forming nondiagnostic, radiolucent apical lesions that can be seen on radiographs. This occurs as a result of chronic periapical inflammation after pulpitis occurs and must be surgically removed. * The PDL also undergoes drastic changes with chronic periodontal disease that involves the deeper structures of the periodontium with periodontitis. The fibers of the PDL become disorganized, and their attachments to either the alveolar bone proper or cementum through Sharpey fibers are lost because of the resorption of these two hard dental tissue. * Pathological damaged or diseased PDL can result in delayed healing of the alveolar socket in cases where the diseased tooth is ultimately extracted.

He was born in Karlsruhe.  Life  His father was Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden, the heir to the Margraviate of Baden, which was raised to a grand duchy after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. His mother was Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt, the daughter of Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was the brother-in-law of the rulers of Bavaria, Russia, and Sweden. His sister Caroline was the queen consort of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, his sister Louise was the empress consort of Alexander I of Russia and his sister Frederica was the queen consort of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. At the age of 15, Charles went on a journey to visit his sisters in their courts in St. Petersburg and Stockholm. He was on his way home with his father, when his father died in a fall from his coach on 15 December 1801. Charles was a witness to this accident. Due to the strong influence of France on the court of Baden, Charles was forced to marry Emperor Napol√©on I's adopted daughter, St√©phanie de Beauharnais, in Paris on 8 April 1806, this despite his own protests and those of his mother and sisters. Charles apparently preferred the hand of his cousin Princess Augusta of Bavaria. It would be five years before the couple would produce an heir. Charles went to war in 1807 as head of the Baden contingent under Marshal Lefebvre. There he took part in the siege of Danzig. In 1808, Charles returned to the side of his grandfather. His grandfather's age was beginning to show and Charles became co-regent. Charles was 25 years old when he succeeded his grandfather Charles Frederick upon the latter's death on 11 June 1811. On 4 October 1817, as neither he nor the other sons from his grandfather's first marriage had surviving male descendants, Charles confirmed the succession rights of his half-uncles from the Hochberg morganatic line, granting each the title, Prince and Margrave of Baden, and the style of Highness. He asked the princely congress in Aachen on 20 November 1818, just weeks before his death, to confirm the succession rights of the sons of Louise Caroline, Countess of Hochberg, morganatic second wife of Grand Duke Charles Frederick. But this proclamation of Baden's succession evoked international challenges. The Congress of Vienna had, in 1815, recognised the eventual claims of Austria and Bavaria to parts of Baden which it allocated to Charles Frederick in the Upper Palatinate and the Breisgau, anticipating that upon his imminent demise those lands would cease to be part of the Grand Duchy. The disputes were resolved by the Treaty of Frankfurt, 1819, under which Baden ceded a portion of Wertheim, already enclaved within Bavaria, to that Kingdom, whereupon the succession as settled in 1817 was recognized by Bavaria and Austria. Events that occurred during his reign * The end of Napoleon I's rule and the Congress of Vienna, which confirmed the territorial gains Baden had made during the Napoleonic era. * 1818: The passing of a new, liberal constitution * The height of Friedrich Weinbrenner's career * 1817: The start of the administration of the Rhine by Johann Gottfried Tulla * The premiere of the velocipede by Karl Drais Marriage and family Hereditary Prince Charles married St√©phanie de Beauharnais (28 August 1789 ‚Äì 29 January 1860), daughter of Claude de Beauharnais and adoptive daughter of Emperor Napol√©on I in Paris on 8 April 1806. Their children: *Princess Louise Amelie of Baden (5 June 1811 ‚Äì 19 July 1854) she married Gustav of Sweden on 9 November 1830 and they were divorce in 1843. They have two children. *Prince of Baden (29 September 1812 ‚Äì 16 October 1812) *Princess Josephine of Baden (21 October 1813 ‚Äì 19 June 1900) she married Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen on 21 October 1834.

They have three children. As Grand Duke Charles did not have any surviving male children, upon his death in Rastatt, he was succeeded by his uncle Louis I. It has been speculated that the foundling Kaspar Hauser was his son, and therefore the actual hereditary prince.

He secured the continued existence of the University of Freiburg in 1820, after which the University was called the Albert-Ludwig University. He also founded the Polytechnic Hochschule Karlsruhe in 1825. The Hochschule is the oldest technical school in Germany. Ludwig's death in 1830 led to many rumors. His death also meant the extinction of his line of the Baden family. The succession then went to the children of the morganatic second marriage of Grand Duke Karl Friedrich and Louise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg, who was created Countess of Hochberg in the Austrian nobility at the personal request of Karl Friedrich. After Ludwig's death, there was much discussion about a mysterious seventeen-year-old man named Kaspar Hauser, who had appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 1828. Seventeen years previously, the first son of the future Grand Duke Karl and his French wife St√©phanie de Beauharnais died under what were later portrayed as mysterious circumstances. There was at the time and still is today (in 2007) speculation that Hauser, who died (perhaps murdered) in 1833, was that child.

The Hague Congress is famous for the expulsion of the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin for clashing with Karl Marx and his followers over the role of politics in the IWMA. It marked the end of this organization as a unitarian alliance of all socialist factions (anarchists and Marxists). History =Background= The background to the congress lay in the failure of the Paris Commune in June of the previous year, and in the different lessons drawn from it by the two most prominent members of the International, Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin. Marx, in his pamphlet The Civil War in France, believed that the major lesson from the Commune was that it was essential for the proletariat to take control of the State and thus the International had to become a true political party of the proletariat. On the other hand, Bakunin saw the most important element of the Commune as being the Parisian workers' rejection of the State in all its forms and continued to call for a revolutionary alliance of workers and peasants in a decentralized organization. In September 1871, the General Council of the International, headed by Marx, held a conference in London at which a series of resolutions were passed, including one (sometimes known as Resolution No.9) which stated: \\"That this constitution of the working class into a political party is indispensable in order to ensure the triumph of the social revolution and its ultimate end ‚Äî the abolition of classes.\\"Resolution of the London Conference on Working Class Political Action http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/09/politics-resolution.htm This was seen by many to imply a major change of direction to the content of the International's General Rules. The resolution caused a great deal of consternation in many sections of the International, particularly in Italy, French-speaking Switzerland and Spain, as it was seen as a measure which would eliminate the autonomy of local sections and turn the General Council into a centralized political office. The Conference itself was considered irregular by these sections, who believed that decisions of this nature could only have been decided at a regular congress of the International. In June 1872, a Congress was convened for 2 September 1872 in The Hague, the agenda for which was to concern a general revision of the organization's General Rules. =During the conference= Caf√© Concert Excelsior, Lange Lombardstraat 109, The Hague. Location of the Hague Congress of 1872 The Hague Congress met from 2 to 7 September 1872 in The Hague, the Netherlands. Marx declared that the proletariat had to take control of the state for a successful revolution, and advocated that the Congress vote to uphold this view. The anarchists naturally objected. Anarchist leaders Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled for protesting after the Congress accepted Marx's proposal. Bakunin was not present at the conference but was expelled in absentia. =Aftermath= After the expulsion of Bakunin and James Guillaume from the Hague Congress, the anarchists declared it null and void.Mikhail Bakunin, \\"On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx\\", 1872 The anarchist faction (including the Jura federation, and the federations of Spain, Italy and Belgium) then held its own Congress of Saint-Imier, a few days later, from which also emerged the Anarchist St. Imier International.Yuri Mikhailovich Steklov, History of the First International, Part II Chapter Two. The Saint-Imier Congress and the Foundation of the Anarchist International Later in that year of 1872 Bakunin wrote: > The legitimacy of this conference has been contested.

Life and career Originally from Tennessee, Harris earned his B.A. in Secondary Education from the University of Arizona. A former U.S. Marine, Harris served in the Korean War as a machine gunner and a platoon commander. After Korea he attended the US Army Counterintelligence School, and then served the remainder of his 23-year career with the USMC as an intelligence and counterintelligence officer, serving two tours of duty in Vietnam. Following his time in the military, Harris moved to Ashland, Ohio, where he began a career as an automotive dealer. He would own one of the largest Chevrolet and General Motors dealership networks in Northern Ohio. In 1995, Harris sought an open seat in the Ohio House of Representatives in a Republican district. He won easily, and began his first term on January 3, 1995. He won reelection in 1996. By 1997, Harris was serving as majority whip of the House. He won reelection in 1998. The Ohio Senate announced Harris' death on November 27, 2017. Ohio Senate While Harris was seen as a potential Speaker of the House in 2000, a vacant seat in the Ohio Senate changed his political future. In summer of 2000, Senator Dick Schafrath resigned from his seat before facing term limits in 2002. Harris was appointed to the seat. He was seated in the upper chamber on August 15, 2000, and resigned from his House seat on the same day. Harris won a full term to the Senate in 2000, facing minimal opposition, and served as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, one of the more powerful chairmanships in the legislature. In late 2004, ongoing disputes between Senators Randy Gardner and Jeff Jacobson, who were both vying to be the next President of the Senate, left President Doug White's successor unnamed. Both dropped out of the running, leaving darkhorse candidate Harris to take the top position in the Senate in 2005. He served in the capacity for three General Assemblies, or six years. Harris easily won a second term in 2006. By 2010, Harris was term limited, and after fifteen years, left the legislature. He was succeeded in the Senate by Kris Jordan, and as President of the Senate by Tom Niehaus. Following his time as a legislator, Harris returned to Ashland County and retired.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 214 ‚Äì 215. The clan takes its name from Glen Garry where the river Garry runs eastwards through Loch Garry to join the Great Glen about 16 miles (25 km) north of Fort William, Highland.  History  = Origins of the clan = Clan tartan. Illustration by R. R. McIan from James Logan's The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, published in 1845. Glengarry is in Lochaber which was part of the ancient Kingdom of Moray that was ruled by the Picts. Ranald was the son of John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, and Ranald himself had five sons. One of them was Alan, the progenitor of the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald and another was Donald. Donald married twice: firstly Laleve, daughter of the chief of Clan MacIver, by whom he had one son named John. Donald married secondly a daughter of the chief of the Clan Fraser of Lovat by whom he had two more sons, Alexander and Angus. The first son, John, died without heirs and was therefore succeeded by his half-brother Alexander. Alexander is sometimes considered the first true chief of Glengarry but is usually regarded as the fourth. = 15th and 16th centuries = Glengarry did not play an important part in the politics of Clan Donald until the late fifteenth century. Traditional rights of the chiefs were being replaced with feudal relationships in which the Crown was the ultimate superior, as part of the royal policy to pacify the Scottish Highlands. Most of the chiefs submitted to James V of Scotland and even the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald accepted charters in 1494. However Alexander of Glengarry did not receive a charter, suggesting that he continued to have a rebellious attitude at this time. Finally in 1531 he submitted to royal authority and was pardoned for past offences. He received a Crown charter on 9 March 1539 for the lands of Glengarry, Morar, half the lands of Loch Alsh, Lochcarron, Loch Broom and also Strome Castle. This did not stop Alexander following Donald Gorm Macdonald of Sleat in trying to reclaim the Lordship of the Isles. Donald Gorm was killed attacking Eilean Donan Castle and the rebellion collapsed. Ruins of Strome Castle, the original seat of the chiefs of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry Subsequently, Alexander of Glengarry was amongst the island chiefs who were tricked into meeting James V at Portree and was imprisoned at Edinburgh where he remained until the king died in 1542. Glengarry himself died in 1590. His son was Angus who was politically astute and used the influence of his father-in-law, the chief of Clan Grant, to gain a charter from James VI of Scotland, regaining his ancestral estates in 1574. In a bond of manrent, dated 1571, between Angus MacAlester of Glengarry and Clan Grant, Glengarry makes an exception in favour \\"of ye auctoritie of our soverane and his Chief of Clanranald only \\". This is held by Clanranald of Moydart as an acknowledgment by Glengarry of the Captain of Clanranald as his chief.Mackenzie (1881), p. 307; p. 308. = 17th century = Glengarry's house; Invergarry Castle in 2009 The Battle of Morar was fought in 1602 between the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry and Clan Mackenzie.'Conflicts of the Clans' published in 1764 by the Foulis press, written from a manuscript wrote in the reign of James VI of Scotland. Angus was succeeded by Donald, 8th chief, who is reputed to have lived for over one hundred years. Invited in 1626 by Lord Ochiltree, the Lord Chancellor of Scotland to discuss Royal policy for the Western Isles, he disagreed with the proposals and was imprisoned for a time. Despite this, in March 1627 he obtained a charter under the great seal that erected Glengarry into a free barony. When the 1638-1652 Wars of the Three Kingdoms began, Donald was too old for active campaigning and leadership passed to his son, Aeneas, later 9th chief. He served under James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose throughout his 1644-1645 campaign and protected him after the Battle of Philiphaugh. Aeneas forfeited his estates when Scotland was incorporated into the 1653 to 1659 Protectorate. They were returned after the 1660 Restoration and he received the title Lord Macdonell and Aros. When James II & VII was expelled in the 1688 Revolution, the Glengarry MacDonells were among the 2% of Scots who remained Catholics. Ranald acted as head of the Catholic Jacobite faction and during the 1689 Rising, the Scots Parliament confiscated his lands, although he continued to hold Invergarry Castle. By late 1691, Invergarry was closely besieged and the Scottish government was determined to 'make an example' of the Macdonells. However, after agreeing to pardon Ranald, they switched targets to the Glencoe MacDonalds, which resulted in the Glencoe Massacre. =18th century to modern day= Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, ca 1812. Glengarry took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715 and fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. When the captain of the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald was killed, Glengarry is said to have rallied his men by throwing up his bonnet and crying Revenge today and mourning tomorrow; in 1716, James Francis Edward Stuart made him Lord Macdonell in the Jacobite peerage. General Wade's report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength at 800 men. Glengarry's Regiment served throughout the 1745 Rising, initially led by Aeneas, Glengarry's second son; he was accidentally shot dead after Falkirk and replaced by his kinsman Lochgarry who commanded at the Battle of Culloden. His elder brother Alastair, later 13th Glengarry was captured by a British frigate in November 1745 when travelling from France to join the Rising. Imprisoned in the Tower of London, he was released in 1747 and at some point became a British government double agent. His reasons are still disputed but Scottish historian Andrew Lang confirmed his identity as 'Pickle the Spy' in 1897. The Highland Clearances of the early 19th century forced the majority of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry into exile; most settled in Glengarry County, Ontario and parts of Nova Scotia. These were driven by the 15th chief, Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell, who was allegedly the model for haughty and flamboyant Highland chieftain Fergus MacIvor in Walter Scott's 1814 novel, Waverley. In June 1815, Glengarry formed the Society of True Highlanders, a rival to the Celtic Society of Edinburgh; he was closely involved in arguments over precedence before, during, and after George IV's visit to Scotland in 1822. The occasion is best remembered for popularising the idea of tartans and Highland dress. His contemporary Alexander Macdonell (1762‚Äì1840) became a Catholic priest in Lochaber. In 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, he served as chaplain in the Glengarry Fencibles, which was disbanded in 1804. Father Macdonell accompanied his clansmen to Glengarry County and helped reform the regiment for service in the War of 1812. In 1826, he was appointed first bishop of Kingston, Ontario.

The museum is dedicated to depicting the Holocaust through the personal stories of its victims. History The VHM first opened in 1997, founded by Mark Fetter, Devorah Ben David, Jay Ipson, and Al Rosenbaum. Housed in the former Education building at Temple Beth El, the museum became an attraction for school field trips. Within a few years, the museum outgrew the space at Temple Beth El, and required additional space to handle the growing number of visitors and school groups. The Virginia General Assembly offered the American Tobacco Company Warehouse for the relocation of the museum. After restoration and reconfiguration of the building, the expanded Virginia Holocaust Museum was dedicated on Yom HaShoah, the Holocaust Day of Remembrance, 2003. The Virginia Holocaust Museum has grown steadily since 2003, and now has an average of over 42,000 visitors each year. The VHM remains an important location for Virginia field trips, with students from over 100 middle and high schools visiting yearly. The museum began an extensive ongoing exhibition renovation project in 2015. Much of the permanent exhibition had never been updated since opening in 2003, and the renovations serve to both update the information contained with newly uncovered facts and figures, as well as update the core exhibition space to modern standards. The VHM hopes these renovations will be completed by 2020.  Mission  Founded to educate the community about the tragedies of the Holocaust, the Virginia Holocaust Museum memorializes and documents the atrocities of World War II. Through exhibits, programming, and outreach, the Museum uses the history of genocide to teach the dangers of prejudice and indifference.  Exhibits  Lithuanian synagogue burn, 9 July 1941 = Core exhibition = Located on the first floor of the museum, the core exhibits narrate the history of the Holocaust. As visitors progress through these exhibits‚Äîand chronologically through the events of the Holocaust‚Äîthey are presented with a glimpse into the systematic destruction of European Jewry. 300 artifacts and the testimonies of local Holocaust survivors expand upon this history, representing the tangible and personal realities of this event. = German G√ºterwagen = In 2004, the VHM acquired an authentic \\"goods wagon,\\" or freight car, used during the Third Reich. Alexander Lebenstein, a local Holocaust survivor, worked with the museum to bring this important artifact to Richmond. Visitors have the opportunity to enter the artifact and imagine the conditions experienced by the people transported in this type of rail car. = Ipson Saga = At the center of the VHM's core exhibits is the story of a single family, the Ipsons. The Ipson Saga exhibition shares the experience of a family of local Holocaust survivors whose confinement in the Kovno Ghetto and harried escape to a farm in the Lithuanian countryside highlight the constant dangers Jews faced during the Holocaust. = Nuremberg Courtroom = Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials The Nuremberg Trials were the first international trials of major Nazi war criminals. As such, they served as a major source of documents and testimony for early Holocaust scholarship. The Nuremberg Courtroom exhibit gives visitors the chance to see a full recreation of Room 600 at the Palace of Justice, used during the International Military Tribunals, and to experience the gravity of the trials. The Nuremberg Courtroom exhibit was opened to the public by Virginia Governor Tim Kaine during a ceremony in April 2008.

Old names for this river include Guallaga and Rio de los Motilones. The Huallaga is born on the slopes of the Andes in central Peru and joins the Mara√±√≥n before the latter reaches the Ucayali River to form the Amazon. Its main affluents are the Monz√≥n, Mayo, Biabo, Abiseo and Tocache rivers. Coca is grown in most of those valleys, which are also exposed to periodic floods. Description Although it runs for 700 miles (1,100 km), it remains unnavigable for most part. For nearly its entire length the Huallaga is an impetuous torrent running through a succession of gorges. It has forty-two rapids (pongos) and it crosses the Andes, forming the Pongo de Aguirre gorge. From this point, from the Amazon, the Huallaga can be ascended by larger river boats (lanchas) to the port city of Yurimaguas, Loreto. Although there are no defined boundaries, the river is commonly divided into two or three sections. From the town of Tocache in San Martin to the source of the river is generally referred to as the Upper Huallaga. Regions of the river are also referred to as central Huallaga (usually from Tocache or Juanjui to Chazuta), and the lower Huallaga (usually from Chazuta to Yurimaguas where the Huallaga meets the Mara√±on). These divisions are for general reference, and are independent of the \\"highland\\" and \\"lowland\\" jungle regions of the Amazon Rainforest. Between the Huallaga and the Ucayali lies the famous \\"Pampa del Sacramento,\\" a level region of stoneless alluvial lands covered with thick, dark forests, first entered by Christian missionaries in 1726. It is about long, from north to south, and varies in width from 40 to 100 kilometers. Many streams, navigable for canoes, penetrate this region from the Ucayali and the Huallaga. In addition to peasants, it is still occupied by many indigenous communities, such as the Cocama-Cocamilla. The river and the riversides suffer point source pollution, utilized as an interminable garbage dump. At least one chute for garbage trucks is installed. Bio-diversity The Huallaga River supports a myriad of wildlife and vegetation. The river is especially rich in amphibian life. A total of 18 species of frogs have been recorded from it, including the Prostherapis femoralis, Phyllodromus pulchellus and Dendrobates reticulatus. Coca Since the 1980s, the primary coca growing and drug trafficking activities in Peru have been in the Upper Huallaga Valley. The coca is flown to Colombia, where it is used to create cocaine, which is subsequently shipped to the United States. Vladimiro Montesinos, ex-head of Peru's intelligence service, is reported to have received $50,000 for every plane laden with drugs allowed to leave the Huallaga Valley. Notable deaths Eric Fleming who played trail boss Gil Favor in the long-running Western TV series Rawhide was killed in the Huallaga River. During the shooting of location shots for an MGM film titled High Jungle on the Huallaga River on September 28, 1966, Fleming fell from a capsized dug-out canoe after paddling it beyond the rapids. His body was lost in the turbulent water and was not recovered until three days later.TV Actor Eric Fleming is Drowned, St. Petersburg Times.

After several anthropological studies, they provide good illustrations of how colonial authorities become unwittingly enmeshed in local politics; of sustainable subsistence agricultural production in crowded areas; of successful self-directed development of market-oriented agriculture; and of the use of \\"traditional\\" cultural resources to prosper in modern Nigeria. Colonial history The population known as the Kofyar actually comprises three different \\"tribes\\" as designated by British colonial officers: the Doemak (or Dimmuk), Merniang, and Kwalla. However the three groups have a common language, economic pattern, and origin myth, and had formed into a union called the Koffyer Federation in the 1940s; they have therefore been referred to as a single group by anthropologists.Stone, Glenn Davis 1996 Settlement Ecology: The Social and Spatial Organization of Kofyar Agriculture. University of Arizona Press, Tucson When first encountered by early British colonial authorities, they lived in the rugged hills in the southeastern corner of the Jos Plateau and in settlements around the plateau base. Their subjugation by the British was largely non-violent until 1930, when a young Assistant District Officer named Barlow was killed in the hill village of Latok by a rock thrown at his head. After this the residents of Latok and neighboring villages were forced out of the hills and made to live on the plains below for nine years. In an award-winning study, anthropologist Robert Netting explained how Barlow had been unknowingly used in a local political dispute.Netting, Robert McC. 1987 \\"Clashing Cultures, Clashing Symbols: Histories and Meanings of the Latok War\\". Ethnohistory 34(4):352‚Äì380 Culture and agriculture in the Kofyar homeland Robert Netting began anthropological research with the Kofyar in the early 1960s. In the Kofyar homeland population densities were high, approaching 500/km¬≤ in many areas. Netting's primary focus was on the Kofyar ecological adaptations, including the highly intensive agriculture being practiced and also the social institutions that were instrumental to sustainability. Much of the land was in annual cultivation, with animal herds providing dung compost for fertilizer, and steep hillsides were intricately terraced. Netting's Hill Farmers of Nigeria,Netting, Robert McC. 1968 Hill Farmers of Nigeria: Cultural Ecology of the Kofyar of the Jos Plateau. Univ. of Washington Press, Seattle a classic book in the field of cultural ecology, showed how social institutions such as household form and land tenure had adjusted to the intensive cultivation system. Netting compared adaptations of Kofyar and their neighbors to demonstrate Ester Boserup'sBoserup, Ester. 1965.

Aldine, Chicago. thesis that agricultural intensification relates to the growth of increasingly dense population and decreasing per capita land area. Kofyar families farmed most intensively close to their homesteads while using less intensive bush and forest fallow systems, which required less investment, on more distant fields. Netting also observed that the Kofyar demonstrated a reversion to less labor- intensive long-fallow systems when land became available on the plains south of their traditional region. He further developed these ideas and placed the Kofyar within a much broader comparative context in his Smallholders, Householders.Netting, Robert Mc. 1993. Smallholders, Householders: Farm Families and the Ecology of Intensive, Sustainable Agriculture. Stanford University Press, Stanford Economic and cultural change since the 1960s During the 1950s, the Kofyar began to settle in the fertile plains of the Benue Valley to the south of the Jos Plateau. Pioneering farms there used extensive slash-and-burn methods, but with rising population density and market stimulus, intensive methods were gradually introduced. By the 1980s, Benue Valley Kofyar were producing considerable surpluses of yams, rice, peanuts, pearl millet and sorghum using labor-intensive but generally sustainable methodsStone, Glenn Davis, Robert McC.

He played in Major League Baseball from 1898 through 1918 for the Louisville Colonels, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds. Leach played in the first modern World Series in 1903 with the Pirates, hitting four triples to set a record that still stands. He played alongside legendary ballplayers such as Honus Wagner and Mordecai Brown. Leach began his career primarily as an infielder including playing shortstop, second base and, mostly, third base. Later, to take advantage of his speed, Leach played mostly outfield. Leach is also famous for being interviewed for Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times collection. Pittsburgh years Leach (center) with Pirates teammates Fred Clarke and Honus Wagner Leach was well known for his small stature and was nicknamed \\"Wee Tommy\\". In 1902, while with the Pirates, he led the National League in home runs with a total of six. Each one was of the inside-the-park variety, which was not unusual in the \\"dead-ball era\\". 49 of Leach's 63 career home runs were inside-the-park, which is still a National League record. During Leach's years in Pittsburgh as a regular and playing with stars such as Honus Wagner, the Pirates won the National League pennant four times and were World Series champions once. Among the swiftest runners of his era, Leach had 361 stolen bases, 1,355 runs scored, and 172 triples. =1903 World Series= Following two years of infighting, and a subsequent peace pact signed by the presidents of the National and American leagues, Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the Pirates, saw an opportunity to bring fans back to the game and so proposed a \\"World Series\\" between the top teams in the two leagues, Boston and Pittsburgh. With stars Wagner, Leach and player‚Äìmanager Fred Clarke, Pittsburgh appeared the more formidable of the two. And indeed the Pirates jumped to a three to one series lead. Leach had the first World Series hit, a triple off Cy Young, and scored the first ever World Series run in game one with Wagner batting him in. Leach finished the game with two singles and two triples as the Pirates won, seven to three. In game four, Leach again starred, getting two hits, including a two-run triple and knocking in three runs, with the Pirates winning a close game five to four. Pittsburgh, at this point, had a seemingly insurmountable three games to one lead, but would not win again, losing the series to Boston five games to three. Despite the loss, Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss could feel his vision of a World Series had been a success, since the public had come out in large numbers to watch the games with over 100,000 paying spectators, the games had been hard-fought, with the players on both teams giving it their all, and the Pirates had proven to be a mighty foe, with stars such as Leach proving their worth on the field. Leach led both teams in RBIs in the series with seven and finished second on the Pirates in batting average for the series. A commonly cited anecdote, one which Leach recanted to Lawrence Ritter, is the Boston Royal Rooters constant chanting of the popular song \\"Tessie\\" threw Honus Wagner off his game, though it is more likely that Wagner played hurt during the series. Later years After his playing career was over, Leach managed in the minor leagues, was signed as an infield coach for the minor league Atlanta Crackers in 1929, and did some scouting for the Boston Braves. Leach was considered for a few managerial positions including manager of the New York Yankees as well as the Chicago entry of the Federal League. He eventually retired in Florida where he went into the citrus business. Leach was the oldest participant included in Lawrence Ritter's famous The Glory of Their Times collection, having been born in 1877 and being 86 when Ritter interviewed him. Leach, as part of his interview with Ritter for the book recounted an anecdote concerning Dummy Hoy. It seems the two roomed together in 1899, and Leach said of Hoy: \\"We got to be good friends. He was a real fine ballplayer. When you played with him in the outfield, the thing was that you never called for a ball. You listened for him and if he made this little squeaky sound, that meant he was going to take it.\\" Leach went on to say, \\"We hardly ever had to use our fingers to talk, though most of the fellows did learn the sign language, so that when we got confused or something we could straighten it out with our hands.\\" As a result of this and similar experiences, some historians credit Hoy with umpires using hand signals for balls and strikes and safe and out calls. In the fall of 1960, Leach appeared on the television program I've Got A Secret alongside Boston American Freddy Parent, as a commemoration of participating in the first World Series in 1903.

Rycroft previously served as Permanent Secretary at the Department for International Development (DFID) from 2018 to 2020 and as the Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York from 2015 to 2018. Early life and education Rycroft was born in Southampton, before moving to Cambridge at the age of eleven. He studied mathematics and philosophy at Merton College, Oxford. Career Rycroft joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) after graduation, in 1989. Following short spells in Geneva and on the NATO desk in Whitehall, Rycroft spent four years at the British embassy in Paris. In 1995-96, Rycroft was Head of Section in the Eastern Adriatic Unit at the FCO: a demanding role, given the aftermath of the Yugoslav Wars. Very soon after taking up this role, he served as a member of the British deputation to the Dayton peace talks. Between 1996 and 1998 he was a desk officer in the FCO Policy Planners. In 1998, he joined the British embassy in the United States, where he served for four years. In 2002, Rycroft was appointed Private Secretary to Prime Minister Tony Blair, to advise him on matters related to foreign policy, the European Union, Northern Ireland and defence. During this time Rycroft wrote a letter to Mark Sedwill, private secretary to the foreign secretary, Jack Straw. The letter reveals that \\"we and the US would take action\\" without a new resolution by the UN security council if UN weapons inspectors showed Saddam had clearly breached an earlier resolution. In that case, he \\"would not have a second chance\\". That was the only way Britain could persuade the Bush administration to agree to a role for the UN and continuing work by UN weapons inspectors, the letter says. Dated 17 October 2002. \\"This letter is sensitive,\\" Rycroft underlined. \\"It must be seen only by those with a real need to know its contents, and must not be copied further.\\" It was in this capacity that Rycroft issued the \\"Downing Street memo\\".

Domestic house spiders range worldwide from as far north as Scandinavia to as far south as Greece in Europe. It is recorded in the checklist of Danish spider species.Checklist of Danish Spiders (Araneae). Version 26-10-2011 (list) It is found from as far north as Maritime Canada to as far south as Louisiana in North America. Some also inhabit parts of Western Asia. Common belief has it that T. domestica, first only occurring in Europe, was accidentally introduced to the Americas by British lumber merchants during the Napoleonic Wars era along with wooden cargo exported over the Atlantic Ocean. Recent arachnological studies, however, suggest that the species had a common ancestor with the giant house spider that spread to both Europe (through Asia) and the rest of North America from Northwestern Canada (possibly from a region currently including British Columbia) long before the first human settlement in North America. Appearance Male Underside of female with long spinnerets Domestic house spiders possess elongated bodies with a somewhat flattened cephalothorax and straight abdomen. Their body/legs ratio is typically 50‚Äì60%, which accounts for a body size of in females and in males. Males are usually distinguished from females by having longer, more agile legs, bloated pedipalps and elongated abdomen. Other distinctions are strictly behavioral. The coloring of an adult T. domestica is typically dark orange to brown or beige (maybe even grayish), with a common characteristic of striped legs and two dull, black, longitudinal stripes on the cephalothorax. The abdomen is mottled in brown, beige, and grey and has a pattern of chevrons running lengthwise across the top (similar to an argyle pattern). Behavior The classic funnel web radiating from the spider's retreat Barn funnel weavers are active and agile hunters, relying on both their vision and movement speed as well as web mechanisms. Their eye configuration, with six out of eight sighting forward, allows them to distinguish even the smallest movement in front of them and either follow it, or retreat if the movement is too large. These spiders are also known to be photosensitive, i.e. moving to or fleeing from the light, depending on situations. Like many agelenids, barn funnel weavers are very precise in their movements. Instead of following a continuous gait pattern, they usually move in short intervals, stopping several times before deciding where to head next. Males will wander aimlessly around the house if undisturbed, but will soon switch to the running interval if prey or threat are spotted. Their legs are perfectly fit for walking (with tarsi bent outward on the tips) and spiders can run over quite long distances in both situations. This spider builds a funnel-shaped web to catch its prey. It usually consists of a multitude of stressed silk threads spun over a flat surface (such as a window sill) near any corner, with a funnel-like structure reaching for the corner, in which the spider would typically reside (hence the name). These webs can become quite large if undisturbed. They act like cord strings, helping the spider glide over them, and once a prey stumbles into the web, it will quickly get attacked, then dragged inside the funnel part and eaten, but very rarely stored underneath the structure. Females that dwell indoors would usually live for over one or two years on the same web, with some residing for as long as seven years in rarely disturbed places (attics, basement or cellar parts, storage rooms, etc.). Outdoor females perish with cold weather and males rarely live for over a year. In late fall (autumn), an egg sac is made containing up to 50 eggs and put in the very tip of the funnel, protected by the female. Defense mechanisms T. domestica is not a particularly aggressive species and will often retreat when confronted. As long as its web is undisturbed, the spider will usually retreat to the funnel tip and stop responding to any movement whatsoever. If the web is attacked and partially destroyed, the spider will attempt to flee the area or may huddle its body into a ball against the wall or some other nearby object. To usher the spider into a container for removal, place open end in front of the spider and use the container lid if so equipped or similar object to push or corral the spider from behind. Since a spider's first reflex after being disturbed from the rear is to move forward, usually the spider will advance into the container placed in front of it. Tegenaria species rarely bite. If they do, the bite is painless.

In this palace, Shah Abbas II and his successors would receive dignitaries and ambassadors, either on the terrace or in one of the stately reception halls.

It was founded in 1999 by Battery Ventures (Tom Crotty, Sunil Dhaliwal, and Scott Tobin) and Ted Julian. Its initial core team of technologists included Dan Geer (Chief Technical Officer) and the east coast security team from Cambridge Technology Partners (including Dave Goldsmith). History In January 2000, @stake acquired L0pht Heavy Industries (who were known for their many hacker employees), bringing on Mudge as its Vice President of Research and Development. Its domain name was atstake.com. In July 2000, @stake acquired Cerberus Information Security Limited of London, England, from David and Mark Litchfield and Robert Stein- Rostaing, to be their launchpad into Europe, the Middle East and Africa. @stake was subsequently acquired by Symantec in 2004. In addition to Dan Geer and Mudge, @stake employed many famous security experts including Dildog, Window Snyder, Dave Aitel, Katie Moussouris, David Litchfield, Mark Kriegsman, Mike Schiffman, Chris Wysopal, Alex Stamos, Cris Thomas, and Joe Grand. In September 2000, an @stake recruiter contacted Mark Abene to recruit him for a security consultant position. The recruiter was apparently unaware of his past felony conviction since @stake had a policy of not hiring convicted hackers. Mark was informed by a company representative that @stake could not hire him, saying: \\"We ran a background check.\\" This caused some debate regarding the role of convicted hackers working in the security business. @stake was primarily a consulting company, but also offered information security training through the @stake academy, and created a number of software security tools: * LC 3, LC 4 and LC 5 were versions of a password auditing and recovery tool also known as L0phtCrack * WebProxy was a security testing tool for Web applications * SmartRisk Analyzer was an application security analysis tool * The @stake Sleuth Kit (TASK) was an open source digital forensics tool (now called The Sleuth Kit). Symantec later stopped selling LC5 to new customers citing US Government export regulations, and discontinued support in December 2006. In January 2009, L0phtCrack was acquired by the original authors from Symantec; L0phtCrack 6 was announced at the SOURCE Boston Conference on March 11, 2009. The technology underlying SmartRisk Analyzer was extended, and eventually brought to market by the Symantec spinoff Veracode. Symantec announced its acquisition of @stake on September 16, 2004, and completed the transaction on October 9, 2004. Several members of @Stake left to form the computer security company \\"iSEC Partners\\" in 2004. Former @stake academy instructors Rob Cheyne and Paul Hinkle later formed the information security training company \\"Safelight Security Advisors\\" in 2007.

The (211 meters to top floor) international style tower was built between 1976 and 1982. Since the building's opening, it has been occupied by state-owned Pemex, one of the largest petroleum companies in the world. History The Pemex Executive Tower originally proposed to replace two 14-story towers built between 1967 and 1970. Later, these buildings were replaced by a pair of 26-story towers to house Pemex's administrative offices. However, the 1980s oil boom demanded office space growth and Pemex decided to build a single 52-story tower in a downtown lot with a huge plaza covering an underground avenue. The building is anchored to the ground, rests on 164 concrete and steel piles that penetrate to a depth of 35 meters surpassing the old filling swampy lake to reach firmer ground. In addition, its x-braced structure features 90 shock-absorbers to minimize oscillations from earthquakes. The tower was completed in 1982, but the surrounding plaza was never completed. The Pemex Executive Tower remained the tallest building in Mexico for almost 20 years, until August 2003, when the 55-story Torre Mayor was completed only half a mile away. As of January 2018, the Torre Pemex is the sixth tallest building in Mexico, and the fourth tallest in Mexico City. The tower is currently occupied by approximately 7,000 Pemex employees. On 19 September 1985, the tower withstood a magnitude 8.1 earthquake, as well as other strong earthquakes that commonly strike Mexico City. The building was designed to withstand an earthquake of 8.5 on the Richter scale. January 2013 explosion On January 31, 2013, a powerful explosion rocked the tower, claiming 37 lives and injuring approximately 126. The explosion is believed to have occurred in the basement of the building's link to an adjacent building (which took the most damage). A gas leak and following accumulation ignited by sparks is believed to be the cause of the explosion. Employees said that the Torre Ejecutiva swayed and vibrated for a few seconds.

Later, he was the head of the Foundation of Former GROM Soldiers. Biography S≈Çawomir Petelicki was born September 13, 1946 in Warsaw. In 1969 he graduated from the Law Faculty of the Warsaw University. The same year he joined the I Department(Intelligence) Ministry of Internal Affairs of People's Republic of Poland and, until 1990, he served at various posts in the intelligence. On various posts in Polish embassies abroad he was responsible for counter-intelligence. Since 1973 a military advisor at the Polish consulate in New York. Upon his return to Poland he continued his service in the economical intelligence. After a brief stay in Sweden between 1983 and 1987, where he served as the head of the Polish intelligence in the embassy in Stockholm, he returned to Poland where he was assigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the commanding officer of all the security services guarding Polish embassies and consulates. Apart from his intelligence service, Petelicki was also an active member of special forces. He gained extensive experience in reconnaissance and diversion. Very little is known of the missions he was part of, apart from the missions to North Vietnam in 1971 and to China the following year. In 1990 Petelicki was assigned to a newly formed, then top secret JW 2305 special forces. Initially consisting only of himself, the unit was soon expanded to become GROM. For the first several years the unit remained completely secret. It was first reported to the press in 1992 and became known to the public in 1994, after their first major military operation in Haiti. Dismissed on December 19, 1995, Petelicki remained unassigned. Between May 14 and June 13 of 1996, Petelicki was the deputy Prime Minister for fighting organized crime. On December 7, 1997 he was again assigned as the commanding officer of the GROM unit. On August 15, 1998, the Day of the Polish Army, he was promoted by president Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski to the rank of brigadier general. On September 17, 1999 he finally gave up the command of GROM and retired. Thereafter, he headed the Foundation of Former GROM Soldiers, which helps veterans to meld into society. In his later years he openly criticized the Polish Government and condemned Polish president Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski. He was considered a hero by various right-wing groups because of similarities in their beliefs. He also accused Polish premier Donald Tusk of high treason.  Death  On June 16, 2012, Petelicki's wife found his body lying next to his car parked in the garage of their apartment block in Warsaw. According to the police, Petelicki died from a self-inflicted gunshot to his head. Apart from the bullet entrance and exit wounds in his temples, no other injuries were found on his body, and security cameras did not record the presence of any other people in the garage at the time of his death, leading the police to conclude that Petelicki had committed suicide. He has left no suicide note.

Lost in Blue follows two young teenagers, Keith and Skye, who struggle for survival on a deserted island. The player must learn to use the island's natural resources to create a makeshift home away from home. The sequel, Lost in Blue 2, was released two years later. A third installment of the series, Lost in Blue 3, was released on December 20, 2007 in Japan. Due to an undershipment, the game was difficult to find in the months following its North American release. Gameplay Lost in Blue's gameplay makes extensive use of the system's touchscreen and microphone features. In the fire building sequence, the player must alternate pressing of the L and R buttons in order to build enough friction on the wood, and then blow into the DS's microphone to successfully ignite the fire. If the player later gets a fire maker with bow, he or she can press L or R and it will automatically fill up, allowing the player to blow into the microphone and finishing the fire. The touch screen interface is used for navigating menus, and the island can be explored and interacted with using either the touch screen or the standard control buttons. The game's primary action takes place on the touch screen, while the top screen is used to display Keith and Skye's health, which is categorized by hunger, thirst, stamina, and hit points. If the thirst or energy categories hit zero, the character's hit points will begin to drop. It is also possible for other conditions, such as passing out due to lack of stamina, to occur. The player loses if either Keith or Skye runs out of hit points and dies. Players must multitask in micromanaging both characters' vital statistics while also exploring the island. The game's primary protagonist is Keith, who must lead Skye around the island by hand due to her poor eyesight. Upon completing the game, a \\"Skye Mode\\" is unlocked which allows the player to play the entire game from Skye's perspective. In this mode, she can freely move about the island without assistance, although she is unable to climb as Keith can, severely limiting her range of travel. Story Lost in Blue is not a linear game in its gameplay and its multiple endings provide a different story nearly every time one plays through it. The story advances through exploration of the island, which consists almost entirely of moving deeper inland into the island and uncovering its secrets. Some days may not be spent exploring and advancing the story but rather by just trying to survive by collecting food, building furniture, and so on. The story begins with the protagonists riding on ship when a massive storm causes the vessel to sink. In the commotion, Skye manages to get on a liferaft while Keith plunges into the water, at which point he loses consciousness. Keith wakes up on the beach of the south side of a deserted island. After exploring his surroundings, he finds shelter in a cave. The next day, Keith crosses a nearby river and finds Skye asleep next to her raft, which is apparently undamaged. After she wakes up, Keith and Skye meet for the first time and she tells him that she can't see very well because she has lost her glasses. Keith offers to help her look for her glasses, but accidentally steps on them during the search. With Skye's vision severely impaired, she becomes dependent on Keith to guide her safely around the island. The two return to the cave and make a home. In the following days, Keith enters a routine of leaving the cave to explore the island and gather food and supplies, and Skye helps by preparing meals. Keith also brings Skye along with him on occasion when he finds an area of the island that he can't traverse by himself. During his explorations, Keith comes across some ancient ruins on the island that are clearly man-made and filled with various puzzles. Eventually making his way to the other end of the temple, he discovers that there are in fact other people on the island, but his joy turns to caution when he overhears a conversation between the two men discussing their orders to kill intruders. Keith decides to stealthily slip past them to try to use them to escape the island. Sneaking into the bandits' hideout, Keith discovers a ship and, after uncovering what information he can, returns to Skye. When Keith returns to the bandits' hideout, he discovers that the guards have shaped up and are more vigilant. He also discovers a uniform that he can use as a disguise to sneak into the hideout. When the teens finally escape together, they end up in civilization again. The ending varies depending on Keith's relationship with Skye.

Original version The original version, released on Parlophone R 4219 in October 1956, was recorded by English child actress Mandy Miller with an orchestra conducted by Phil Cardew. It was arranged by Ron Goodwin and produced by George Martin. Although never a hit single, it was played countless times on BBC national radio in the UK in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly on Children's Favourites. The chorus of the song is as follows: :Nellie the Elephant packed her trunk :And said goodbye to the circus :Off she went with a trumpety-trump :Trump, trump, trump Children's author Jacqueline Wilson chose the song as one of her Desert Island Discs in October 2005. Later versions *The punk rock band Toy Dolls did a cover of this song in 1982, which was later released on the 1983 album Dig That Groove Baby. Issued as a single, it reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart in 1984 and No. 97 in Australia. *In 1987, Black Lace released their version of the song which later appeared on their 2011 album The Essential Collection. *Lulu covered the song in 1989 as the theme song to the Animated Television series of the same name, in addition to voicing the title character. This version was also released as a single in 1990. Rhythm The rhythm and tempo of this song is often used to teach people the rhythm of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The recommended rate for CPR is 100 chest compressions per minute. A study at Coventry University compared the effectiveness of this song in maintaining this rhythm with an alternative of \\"That's the Way (I Like It)\\" and no song at all. The version used for the study was from a Little Acorns brand children's record, and was found to have a tempo of 105 beats per minute. Singing the chorus of the song twice, with a compression on each beat, results in exactly 30 compressions, which is the international standard for CPR. The use of \\"Nellie\\" resulted in correct timing for 42 out of 130 cases, as compared with 15 for no music and just 12 for \\"That's the Way (I Like It)\\". However the depth of compression was found to be inadequate in most of those cases, and the use of \\"Nellie\\" was found to increase this inadequacy slightly, as compared with the use of no music (56% too shallow with \\"Nellie\\" and 47% without). More recently the Bee Gees' \\"Stayin' Alive\\" has been promoted as an alternative.

The Tetrarch was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army. It improved upon its predecessor, the Mk VIC Light Tank, by introducing the extra firepower of a 2-pounder gun. The War Office ordered 70 tanks, an order that eventually increased to 220. Production was delayed by several factors and, as a consequence, only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced.Tucker (p. 90) states that 177 of the Mk VII's were built during the war, but Flint (p. 12) states that whilst this figure is given in most published sources, surviving War Office documentation gives a lower figure of 100, putting the final tally somewhere between these two figures The tank's design flaws, combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions, ruled out the use of Tetrarchs in the North African Campaign. As a result, the majority of the tanks remained in Britain, although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the Lend-Lease program. In early 1941, the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations, one of which was equipped with Tetrarchs. In May 1942, a small number of Tetrarchs formed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar, and, in June 1942, Tetrarchs were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air-portable light tank to support British airborne forces. The Tetrarchs were transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders.\\"Huge Gliders Spill Tanks Behind Enemy Lines'\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1944, p. 17. Note ‚Äì article has two errors. One it, mistakenly states the tank loading in the Hamilcar is the American M22 Locust when in fact they are British Tetrarchs. Two, the Hamilcars landed no tanks in Operation Tonga. A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943; instead they were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment. The division used approximately 20 Tetrarchs during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. The tanks were successfully landed by glider, but they did not perform well. Several were lost in accidents, and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces. A few days after the beginning of the operation, the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support. By August 1944, most of the Tetrarchs in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks, and the remainder were replaced by the M22 Locust in December 1944. Tetrarchs did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946; the last was retired in 1950. There were several variations on the Tetrarch design, including the Alecto self- propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII, but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army. Development history =Initial development= The prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII (A17), nicknamed 'Purdah',Bishop, p. 24 was first developed in 1937 by Vickers-Armstrongs as a private venture, and was intended to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign militaries.Flint, p. 9 It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company. The tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns.Tucker, p. 89 Vickers-Armstrong installed on the Mk VIIs a 2-pounder main gun paired with a Besa machine gun, and mounted the two guns in a two-man turret. The tank possessed a maximum of of armour. The prototype weighed approximately and was powered by a Meadows engine. Suspension was on eight road wheels, four per side, with no separate driver or idler wheels and it was capable of a top speed.Flint, p. 11 The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models.Chamberlain & Ellis, p. 26. The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks. For sharper turns, the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the MkVII and reduce its power wastage.Flint, p. 10 The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for springing and cushions of oil for damping, and each of the wheels was independently sprung. Alan Brooke, Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, inspecting a Light Tank Mk VII (Tetrarch) at the Army Staff College, 1941 The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938; the model was tested as a possible \\"light cruiser\\" since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor, the Mark VI. The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the Nuffield A13 offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance.Foss & McKenzie, pp. 95‚Äì97 Despite this, it was decided that it was essential for some Tetrarchs to be produced, and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program. Accordingly, the War Office gave the Tetrarch the official General Staff specification number A17, and, in November 1938, accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank's range. =Production= The number to be produced was subject to fluctuation as the War Office vacillated in their demand; in July 1938, it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced, then increased the request to 120 after a three-day conference in November. Production was to begin in July 1940, but meanwhile the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100. The number further increased to 220 after Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon, a company part owned by Vickers-Armstrong that would be producing the tanks, indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks.Tucker, pp. 89‚Äì90 Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors. The War Office put their order on hold in a post-Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks,Tucker, p. 90 due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle. Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks, light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour, were nevertheless deployed against them; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re-evaluate the suitability of the light tank design. The pre-war role of the light tank, that of reconnaissance, meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross-country abilities. Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled. The cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk VIIs; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177. The name 'Tetrarch' was given to the Mk VII, on 22 September 1941, on the orders of the War Office. The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year. =Transfer to airborne role= The War Office and the Army were concluding, at this point, that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat, and the Tetrarch was considered to be obsolete.Flint, p. 16 This decision may have marked the end for the Tetrarch in active service; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat.Flint, p. 13 The demise of Tetrarch was prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid-1941, as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain's fledgling airborne forces, formed in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.Otway, p, 21 When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces, officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an integral component; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment, which, by 1941, was to include artillery and some form of tank.Flint, p. 15 Plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions, but, by May 1941, the feasibility of a tank to be carried for in a glider was accepted, although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task. In a conference held on 16 January 1941, it was decided that the General Aircraft Hamilcar, currently under development, would be used to transport a single Tetrarch tank or two Universal Carriers.Flint, pp. 15‚Äì16 The Tetrarch was chosen because it was an obsolete design, and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces. Beginning in January 1944, training exercises were conducted carrying the Tetrarchs and their crews inside Hamilcar gliders. These exercises were successful; during the training by 'C' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment, which specialised in flying the Hamilcars, over 2,800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew. Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries, with seven pilots killed during the training.Flint, p. 86 When the Tetrarch was re-designated as an airborne tank, several changes were made to its design. A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a infantry support howitzer; these tanks were then designated as Tetrarch 1 CS (Close Support). Additionally, Littlejohn adaptors were added to those Tetrarchs which still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration. The Tetrarch experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the Army and airborne forces. One of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942, which particularly affected the airborne forces. The transport of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under the Lend-Lease Act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces, as did the loss of several more during Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Madagascar.Flint, p. 14 A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that approximately 50 Tetrarchs were available for use. In a memorandum, dated January 1943, by Major General George F. Hopkinson, commander of the 1st Airborne Division, Hopkinson complained that he had been informed that 70 of the tanks were available, whereas only 50 actually remained, with no reserves to replace those lost in combat.Flint, p. 82 This lack of sufficient replacement reserves, combined with a War Office report that some 287 airborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India, led to the Tetrarch's eventual replacement by the US M22 Locust. Performance A number of design faults of the Tetrarch were revealed through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. Problems were also found with the Littlejohn adaptor fitted to the 2-pounder to increase its range and penetration power; after they had been fitted the adapters could not be removed, and could only fire specially designed armour-piercing rounds, which took time to manufacture.Flint, p. 83 The War Office also considered the Tetrarch's cooling system faulty, making the tank unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa. Operational history =Lend-lease= The first Tetrarchs were delivered to the Army in November 1940, and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division (which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division. However, the faults discovered with the Tetrarch cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign. Shortly after, all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service. The Tetrarchs remained in Britain, and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service, but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR, Operation Barbarossa began, and the USSR became an ally of Britain. The Lend-Lease program, begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China, was therefore extended to the USSR. As part of the program, the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR, which in early 1942, included a shipment of 20 Tetrarchs, as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks. The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British, and so could use the Tetrarchs. When the tanks arrived in the USSR, however, it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions; additionally, the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank's suspension and tracks. Additional testing of the Tetrarchs was conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its controllability, manoeuvrability, and speed, as well its ability to run on low-quality fuel, unlike contemporary Soviet designs. The thinness of the Tetrarch's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved, as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank's speed.Flint, pp. 14‚Äì15 Despite these drawbacks in the Tetrarch's design, Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T-70 light tank in use at the time, and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat. A number of Tetrarchs were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle, and in September 1943 two were assigned to the 132nd Separated Tank Battalion, which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade; both tanks were destroyed in combat, one on 30 September and the other on 2 October, the latter a casualty of artillery fire. Several were also used for propaganda purposes, appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the Caucasus region. =Operation Ironclad= Littlejohn (or Janeƒçek) adaptorFitzsimons, p. 1753 In mid-1941, the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations, known as 'A', 'B' and 'C' Special Service Squadrons. Both 'A' and 'B' Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark VIc light tanks, but 'C' Squadron was equipped with twelve Tetrarchs transferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade, 1st Armoured Division.Flint, pp. 63‚Äì64 On 31 July 1941, 'C' Squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside 'A' and 'B' Squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate.Flint, p. 63 All three squadrons were transported to Inverary in Scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and disembarkation from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations.Flint, pp. 64‚Äì65 In early September, elements of 'C' Squadron, including six Tetrarchs, formed part of a force which sailed for Freetown in West Africa; during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany, and the force was readied to capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred.Flint, p. 65 These fears proved groundless, and in March 1942, the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training. The next assignment, Operation Ironclad, was the invasion of Madagascar, the third largest island in the world and then under Vichy French control. The Prime Minister and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of Antsirane to Japanese naval forces, which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean.Flint, p. 66 Operation Ironclad was under the command of Major General Robert G. Sturges and consisted of No. 5 Commando, 29th Independent Brigade Group, and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th Infantry Division. The 29th Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations, and under its command was 'B' Special Service Squadron, created by amalgamating six Valentines from 'B' Squadron and six Tetrarchs from 'C' Squadron into a single unit. The squadron was formed into four troops, one Headquarters troop of three Valentines and one Tetrarch, one of four Valentines, and two formed from the remaining five Tetrarchs. The invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of Madagascar on 4 May, near Antsirane and the bay of Diego Suarez. The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip, which would allow the British forces to advance approximately and approach Antsirane from the rear. Information about the landing beaches, the defences possessed by the port, and the Vichy French defending forces was limited and vague, although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a Valentine tank.Flint, p. 67 The landings began at 04:30 on 5 May, with 5 Commando landing at Courrier Bay and the three infantry brigades and 'B' Squadron landing at Ambararata Bay. The objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of Antsirane and a nearby town, but although the infantry landed successfully, 'B' Squadron had more trouble; the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a Tetrarch came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand.Flint, p. 68 The infantry brigades advanced toward Antsirane without the squadron, but eventually two Valentines and a single Tetrarch were dispatched in support, catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of Anamakia. Here the invasion force encountered the first French defences, consisting of camouflaged trenches and pillboxes dug in along a ridge. The tanks attempted to breach them, but the rocky ground made manoeuvring difficult and they could not close with the pillboxes and trenches; they engaged a number of targets with 2 pounder and machine-gun fire, but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day. The tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island, and they were soon joined by two other Tetrarchs dispatched from the beaches; the small force continued to advance until it encountered the Vichy French main line of defence. This had been built prior to the First World War and included camouflaged pillboxes, machine-gun nests and dug-in 75 mm artillery pieces; the latter, although not specifically designed for an anti- tank role, could penetrate the armour of both the Tetrarchs and the Valentines. The two Valentines advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire, and two Tetrarchs that were moving behind them suffered the same fate; the third Tetrarch retreated in order to report on the French resistance, machine gunning a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back.Flint, pp. 68‚Äì69 The commander of the Tetrarch made his report, and was then ordered to take command of four Valentines and two Tetrarchs which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the French defences. The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out-flank the line by advancing from the right-hand side, using several hills as cover; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault, however, and one Valentine and one Tetrarch were hit and destroyed. The remaining tanks exchanged several volleys of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions.Flint, p. 70 The French line was eventually broken by 29th Brigade, aided by an amphibious assault by Royal Marines; the remaining tanks of 'B' Squadron, two Valentines and three Tetrarchs, remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May, coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another Valentine. The squadron played no further part in the battle, as the Vichy French authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day, although French troops would continue to engage the British occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late November.Flint, p. 71 'C' Squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion; only one Valentine and three Tetrarchs out of twelve tanks were functional by 7 May, and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded. It remained in Madagascar until early 1943, when it was shipped to India and took part in the Burma Campaign as part of 29th Brigade.Flint, pp. 71‚Äì72 =Operation Tonga= Because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid-1940, when the British airborne establishment was formed, the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops.Otway, p. 30 Progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, was conducted by a retrained Commando unit.Otway, p. 63 By 1942, there existed specifically trained airborne units, including the 1st Airborne Division, and on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division. This unit, designated the Light Tank Squadron, was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division, using their tanks' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units.Flint, pp. 75‚Äì76 The obvious unit for conversion was 'C' Special Services Squadron, as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and, more importantly, was the only unit that was still using Tetrarchs; it had been re-designated as an airborne tank by the War Office. 'C' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942, bringing with it seven Tetrarchs among its other vehicles.Flint, p. 77 The unit immediately began training, but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long; during mid-1943, the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily. 'C' Squadron remained in Britain, as not enough Hamilcar gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its Tetrarchs;Flint, p. 80 the squadron was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division, which had been raised in April 1943, and 'C' Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict. The squadron continued to train as an air-portable unit, and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties, including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter-attacking enemy infantry and armour.Flint, pp. 83‚Äì84 Side and rear view of a Tetrarch light tank On 13 December 1943, the War Office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars, and on 1 April 1944, it was re-designated as the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment.Flint, p. 84 The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron, a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron; two Tetrarchs, the Mark 1 CS variation, were attached to the Headquarters Squadron, but the Light Tank Squadron, also known as 'A' Squadron, received the majority of the Tetrarchs. 'A' Squadron had approximately nineteen Tetrarchs split between six troops, two of which were of the CS variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with Littlejohn adaptors.Flint, p. 88 On 24 May 1944, after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres, 'A' Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at Tarrant Rushton airfield, while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF Brize Norton airfield the next day; from these two airfields, the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy.Flint, p. 96 The operation began on the night of 5 June, with the deployment of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy. It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne landings, securing strategically important areas east of Caen, capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River Dives, and destroying a coastal artillery battery.Harclerode, p. 307 Insufficient transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division's brigades simultaneously; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day. Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6th Airlanding Brigade, to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached, to be landed first; however, aerial photography revealed that anti-glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade. Therefore, Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade (which did not utilise gliders) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones, allowing the 6th Airlanding Brigade to land in the second lift.Flint, p. 97 Hamilcar gliders of 6th Airlanding Brigade arrive on Drop Zone 'N' carrying Tetrarch tanks, 6 June 1944. The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21:00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade.Buckingham, p. 226 The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack.Flint, p. 98 The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy.Flint, p. 106 It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it, causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight.Buckingham, p. 227 The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury.Flint, p. 115 The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches. The squadron retrieved all of the remaining Tetrarchs and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment; there, they received orders to support the 8th Parachute Battalion in the Bois de Bavent area and conduct reconnaissance duties. After linking with the battalion, the squadron began reconnoitring, and engaged German infantry and armour they encountered. By the end of 7 June, two Tetrarchs had been lost to enemy action, one destroyed by a German self- propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine.Flint, pp. 119‚Äì120 The division was reinforced by British troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy, while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties. At this time, Gale decided to avoid, when possible, engaging the Tetrarchs with German armour, as they proved to be completely outclassed by the German tanks and self-propelled guns, such as the Panzer IV and the Sturmgesch√ºtz III.Doherty, p. 28 Instead, when the division required armoured support, it summoned it from armoured units outside the division, and the Tetrarchs were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support.Flint, pp. 122‚Äì123 By August, in the division's preparation for the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead, the majority of Tetrarchs in 'A' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks; only three Tetrarchs remained, assigned to the Headquarters troop of 'A' Squadron.Flint, p. 125 =Post-war= Operation Tonga was the last that Tetrarchs saw of active combat. During the first week of October 1944, the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive reorganization, in which it was completely restructured, and all the remaining Tetrarchs were retired.Flint, p. 138 They were replaced with the M22 Locust, a purpose-built airborne light tank of American design; eight Locusts were used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation Varsity, the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine. A report issued by the Director (Air) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Tetrarch design was considered obsolete, and any light tanks used in post-war airborne formations would be entirely new in design.Flint, p. 192 A small number of Tetrarchs remained in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949; a Hamilcar glider flight was stationed at RAF Fairford, and a troop of Tetrarchs was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders. However, glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the Tetrarchs withdrawn from service.Flint, p. 193 Variants Diagram of a floatation screen fitted to a Tetrarch tank, taken from Straussler's patent, , issued 1945 There were several variants of the Tetrarch design. The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII, Vickers-Armstrong's proposed successor to the Tetrarch. The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry Hopkins, named after President Roosevelt's chief diplomatic advisor, and was given the General Staff design number A25 by the War Office. The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the Tetrarch in a number of areas. It had thicker armour than the Tetrarch, with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of and the side armour to , and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help deflect shells fired at the tank.Flint, p. 18 The dimensions of the Tetrarch were also changed; the Mark VIII was longer by , wider by and heavier. The new tank was no longer air-portable, as it was too heavy to be carried by a Hamilcar. The 12-cylinder engine of the Tetrarch was fitted to the Mark VIII, although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to ; its armament also remained the same as that of the Tetrarch. The War Office authorised the construction of three prototype models in April 1941. The new design was considered a success, and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1,000 to be constructed in September. However, problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes, and a report issued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems. These problems continued to persist into 1943, when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service; approximately 100 Mark VIIIs were produced by 1945, when production ended.Flint, p. 19 A second variant on the Tetrarch design was the Tetrarch Duplex Drive (\\"Tetrarch DD\\"). The Duplex Drive system was invented by Nicholas Straussler, and was designed to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.

Though she did not sing on the studio recordings of their songs, she did perform live and subsequently established an independent career as a singer. Early years Brought up in Birmingham, England, Williams began working as a model, eventually gaining the title Miss Black Beautiful in a contest in 1973. After this initial success she went on to front her own band, Black Beautiful People. She later moved to West Germany with her friend Sheyla Bonnick. One day in 1975, while at a restaurant, the two were approached by an agent who asked if they were interested in joining a new pop group Boney M. \\"She asked if we could sing. Well, you don't say no, do you,\\" Williams later recalled in an interview. She had previously been singing with a local band back in England but had been told off by her brother Billy: \\"You have a terrible voice. Better keep working as a walking clothes-hanger.\\"Gerd R√∂ckl: Boney M. (German book, 1978) p. 126 It turned out that it was not important if Williams could sing or not, since the job was to dance and mime to a disco song called \\"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\\" that producer Frank Farian had recorded all the vocals for himself but was unable to promote himself since he had a career as a schlager singer in his own name. So Williams and Bonnick teamed up with a girl called Nathalie and a boy called Mike and did a discoth√®que tour and a few TV performances over the next months. Nathalie left and was replaced by Claudja Barry. Sheyla then decided that lip-syncing was not for her and left, hoping to achieve a solo career. Mike left as well, and the two were replaced by new members Marcia Barrett and Bobby Farrell. When Claudja went the same way as Sheyla, Liz Mitchell took her place, and finally the pieces fell together: Boney M. were assembled as a real group and ready to do a follow-up to \\"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\\". Boney M. Both Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett were singers and would participate in the group's recordings together with producer Frank Farian who did the deep male voice. The threesome recorded the follow-up single \\"Daddy Cool\\" which soon became a worldwide hit and launched the group's phenomenal career, with numerous hit singles and albums over the next decade. Williams and Bobby Farrell did not sing on the records since \\"their voices weren't suited for this particular kind of music\\" as Farian put it in a Bravo interview in 1978. It did not create a scandal ‚Äì both Williams and Farrell did sing during the group's many live performances during their extensive world tours 1977‚Äì1979. Williams remained with the group until the ultimate break-up in 1990. In 1994, she did what her former colleagues Liz Mitchell and Bobby Farrell had also done, she formed her own Boney M group, billed as Boney M featuring Maizie Williams. The group also featured Sheyla Bonnick from the short-lived original 1975 line-up. Williams herself would finally front as a lead singer in the group's renditions of the hits \\"Brown Girl in the Ring\\", \\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday\\", \\"Sunny\\" and \\"Daddy Cool\\". Vocal controversy It is stated on Williams' official site that \\"it's no secret that although she sang in the studio Williams' less dominant voice appears to have been mostly excluded from many of the recordings, with the exception of some backing vocals, for reasons only the producer knew at the time\\". However, the inner sleeve of the group's Oceans of Fantasy LP, 1979, lists only Farian, Mitchell and Barrett in the track-by-track vocal credits. Maizie did record a minor part for the group's \\"That's Boonoonoonoos / Train to Skaville\\" which was also broadcast in the 1981 TV special \\"Ein Sound geht um die Welt\\" (A Sound Goes Around the World), but in the final mix released on record, the part was eventually re-recorded by Liz Mitchell. The singer initiated a court case against Boney M.'s producer Frank Farian and Sony/BMG concerning her rights to perform under the name \\"Boney M\\". Farian was promoting Liz Mitchell's group as the authentic continuation of Boney M. The court heard that \\"she had not sung on any of the band's recordings\\". On 16 February 2009, Williams had judgement in the case, that Farian has to account to her for pay on all record sales and future sales. Present Besides still touring the world, Williams released her first solo record in December 2006, Call Upon Jesus, including the download single \\"Praise Be Unto Him\\". In February 2007, she released her own dance version of the Boney M. hit \\"Sunny\\". In June, she starred as the featured vocalist on Latvian group Melo-M's version of \\"Daddy Cool\\" which hit the No. 1 spot in the LMK charts in the last week of August. In September 2011, a Dutch press release was issued regarding a tribute single that has been written by Williams, together with Dutch songwriters Eddie Middle-Line and Bj√∂rn de Water. The song and video for \\"Josephine Baker\\" (Eddie Middle-Line Mix) had a worldwide release.

In France and the Netherlands he is also still known as Corneille de La Haye () after his birthplace, The Hague. Although he is well documented as the leading painter in this distinctively French style, because he never signed or dated his paintings very few identifiable works can be firmly traced as his, with the first one identified in 1962. Distinguishing his hand from the many other artists working in the same style is therefore extremely difficult, if not impossible; works tend to be attributed to him on grounds of quality alone.Anthony Blunt, \\"Art and Architecture in France, 1500‚Äì1700\\", pp. 62‚Äì64, 2nd edn 1957, Penguin Corneille's portraits are nearly miniature in scale, ranging from the size of a postcard to about 8\\" x 10\\". Corneille worked in oil paint on wood panels. The flesh areas are painted very thinly, while the greenish backgrounds are painted more thickly. Similarities with the work of Hans Holbein may point to the use of tracing frames by both painters. The Louvre in Paris and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art are both good places to study Corneille's work. The Metropolitan has a portrait in the Robert Lehman collection, and another in the Jack and Belle Linsky collection, as well as six other works, some of which are not always on view. Boston's Museum of Fine Arts has two works by Corneille and the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields has three works. His Portrait of an Unknown Gentleman has been in the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon since 2014.

The name refers to the color of bruising. The so-called black eye is the result of accumulation of blood and fluid in the loose areolar tissue following a blow to the head. This blood tracks freely under the scalp producing a generalised swelling over the dome of the skull but cannot pass into either occiptial or the temple regions because of the bony attachments of the Occipitofrontalis muscle. But this fluid can, however track forward into the eyelid because of the Occipitofrontalis muscle has no bony attachment anteriorly. This leads to formation of Hematoma a few hours after the head injury or cranial operation. If a more extensive injury, potentially even a skull fracture, an apparent black eye can sometimes worsen and may require professional medical treatment before it will resolve. This is more likely if the area around both eyes has been injured (raccoon eyes) or if there is a history of prior head injury or fracture around the eye. Though disfiguring, the vast majority of black eyes are not serious, require little or no treatment, and will resolve spontaneously within a week or two. Bleeding within the eye, a condition called a hyphema, is more serious: it can permanently reduce vision and can result in damage the cornea. In some cases, abnormally high pressure inside the eyeball (ocular hypertension) can also result. Signs and symptoms Progression of periorbital hematoma over ten days: the blood is gradually absorbed, but the iron-laden pigments in the blood remain in the tissue leaving a discoloration that persists for longer. Despite the name, the eye itself is not affected. Blunt force or trauma to the eye socket results in burst capillaries and subsequent haemorrhaging (hematoma). The fatty tissue along with the lack of muscle around the eye socket allows a potential space for blood accumulation. As this blood decomposes and is resorbed, various pigments are released lending itself to the extreme outward appearance. The appearance (discoloration in purple and blue along with swelling) does not usually indicate a serious injury, and most black eyes resolve within a week. The tissues around the eye are soft and thus bruise easily when compressed against margins of bone which surround and protect the eye socket. The treatment is the same as that for bruises in other parts of the body ‚Äì cold compresses during the first twenty-four hours. During the process of healing, and so long as there no breaks in the skin, a black eye can be made less conspicuous by using cosmetics designed to obscure discolorations of the skin. In a severe contusion, blowout of the floor of the orbit may occur, leading to double vision. Such an injury requires surgical correction. Treatment Unless there is actual trauma to the eye itself (see below), extensive medical attention is generally not needed. Applying an ice pack will keep down swelling and reduce internal bleeding by constricting the capillaries. Analgesic drugs (painkillers) can be administered to relieve pain. An anecdotal remedy for a black eye consists of applying raw meat to the eye area. Research has yet to find any evidence of this treatment being effective. Likely the raw meat was used when ice packs were not yet commercially available and meat was stored in iceboxes instead of in a protective gas, while cold but not but freezing meat is more gentle to the skin than ice, and will not damage the surface of the skin as the skin temperature cannot go below freezing even in extreme cases. Meat is also soft and comes easier into contact with the skin than blocks of ice that were available. Associated conditions Eye injury and head trauma may also coincide with a black eye. Some common signs of a more serious injury may include: * Double vision * Loss of sight and/or fuzzy vision could occur * Loss of consciousness * Inability to move the eye or large swelling around the eye * Blood or clear fluid from the nose or the ears * Blood on the surface of the eye itself or cuts on the eye itself * Persistent headache or migraine References  External links  Category:Periorbital conditions Category:Injuries of head ","title":"Black eye"},{"id":"1916104","text":"Roman Polko (born November 8, 1962, in Tychy, Poland) is a Polish army officer, acting chief of Biuro Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Narodowego (Bureau of National Security), former commander of \\"JW GROM\\", doctor of military science studies, speciality: management.

Dielectric heating, also known as electronic heating, radio frequency heating, and high-frequency heating, is the process in which a radio frequency (RF) alternating electric field, or radio wave or microwave electromagnetic radiation heats a dielectric material. At higher frequencies, this heating is caused by molecular dipole rotation within the dielectric.  Mechanism  Molecular rotation occurs in materials containing polar molecules having an electrical dipole moment, with the consequence that they will align themselves in an electromagnetic field. If the field is oscillating, as it is in an electromagnetic wave or in a rapidly oscillating electric field, these molecules rotate continuously by aligning with it. This is called dipole rotation, or dipolar polarisation. As the field alternates, the molecules reverse direction. Rotating molecules push, pull, and collide with other molecules (through electrical forces), distributing the energy to adjacent molecules and atoms in the material. The process of energy transfer from the source to the sample is a form of radiative heating. Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy (energy of motion) of the atoms or molecules in a material, so agitating the molecules in this way increases the temperature of the material. Thus, dipole rotation is a mechanism by which energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation can raise the temperature of an object. There are also many other mechanisms by which this conversion occurs. Dipole rotation is the mechanism normally referred to as dielectric heating, and is most widely observable in the microwave oven where it operates most effectively on liquid water, and also, but much less so, on fats and sugars. This is because fats and sugar molecules are far less polar than water molecules, and thus less affected by the forces generated by the alternating electromagnetic fields. Outside of cooking, the effect can be used generally to heat solids, liquids, or gases, provided they contain some electric dipoles. Dielectric heating involves the heating of electrically insulating materials by dielectric loss. A changing electric field across the material causes energy to be dissipated as the molecules attempt to line up with the continuously changing electric field. This changing electric field may be caused by an electromagnetic wave propagating in free space (as in a microwave oven), or it may be caused by a rapidly alternating electric field inside a capacitor. In the latter case, there is no freely-propagating electromagnetic wave, and the changing electric field may be seen as analogous to the electric component of an antenna near field. In this case, although the heating is accomplished by changing the electric field inside the capacitive cavity at radio-frequency (RF) frequencies, no actual radio waves are either generated or absorbed. In this sense, the effect is the direct electrical analog of magnetic induction heating, which is also near-field effect (thus not involving radio waves). Frequencies in the range of 10‚Äì100 MHz are necessary to cause dielectric heating, although higher frequencies work equally well or better, and in some materials (especially liquids) lower frequencies also have significant heating effects, often due to more unusual mechanisms. For example, in conductive liquids such as salt water, ion-drag causes heating, as charged ions are \\"dragged\\" more slowly back and forth in the liquid under influence of the electric field, striking liquid molecules in the process and transferring kinetic energy to them, which is eventually translated into molecular vibrations and thus into thermal energy. Dielectric heating at low frequencies, as a near-field effect, requires a distance from electromagnetic radiator to absorber of less than ‚âà of a wavelength. It is thus a contact process or near-contact process, since it usually sandwiches the material to be heated (usually a non-metal) between metal plates taking the place of the dielectric in what is effectively a very large capacitor. However, actual electrical contact is not necessary for heating a dielectric inside a capacitor, as the electric fields that form inside a capacitor subjected to a voltage do not require electrical contact of the capacitor plates with the (non-conducting) dielectric material between the plates. Because lower frequency electrical fields penetrate non-conductive materials far more deeply than do microwaves, heating pockets of water and organisms deep inside dry materials like wood, it can be used to rapidly heat and prepare many non- electrically conducting food and agricultural items, so long as they fit between the capacitor plates. At very high frequencies, the wavelength of the electromagnetic field becomes shorter than the distance between the metal walls of the heating cavity, or than the dimensions of the walls themselves. This is the case inside a microwave oven. In such cases, conventional far- field electromagnetic waves form (the cavity no longer acts as a pure capacitor, but rather as an antenna), and are absorbed to cause heating, but the dipole-rotation mechanism of heat deposition remains the same. However, microwaves are not efficient at causing the heating effects of low frequency fields that depend on slower molecular motion, such as those caused by ion- drag.  Power  Dielectric heating must be distinguished from Joule heating of conductive media, which is caused by induced electric currents in the media. For dielectric heating, the generated power density per volume is given by: :Q = \\\\omega \\\\cdot \\\\varepsilon_\\\\mathrm{r} \\\\cdot \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\cdot E^2, where œâ is the angular frequency of the exciting radiation, Œµr‚Ä≥ is the imaginary part of the complex relative permittivity of the absorbing material, Œµ0 is the permittivity of free space and E the electric field strength. The imaginary part of the (frequency-dependent) relative permittivity is a measure for the ability of a dielectric material to convert electromagnetic field energy into heat. If the conductivity œÉ of the material is small, or the frequency is high, such that (with ), then dielectric heating is the dominant mechanism of loss of energy from the electromagnetic field into the medium.  Penetration  Microwave frequencies penetrate conductive materials, including semi-solid substances like meat and living tissue. The penetration essentially stops where all the penetrating microwave energy has been converted to heat in the tissue. Microwave ovens used to heat food are not set to the frequency for optimal absorption by water. If they were, then the piece of food or liquid in question would absorb all microwave radiation in its outer layer, leading to a cool, unheated centre and a superheated surface. Instead, the frequency selected allows energy to penetrate deeper into the heated food. The frequency of a household microwave oven is 2.45 GHz, while the frequency for optimal absorbency by water is around 10 GHz.  Radio-frequency heating  The use of high-frequency electric fields for heating dielectric materials had been proposed in the 1930s. For example, (application by Bell Telephone Laboratories, dated 1937) states \\"This invention relates to heating systems for dielectric materials and the object of the invention is to heat such materials uniformly and substantially simultaneously throughout their mass. It has been proposed therefore to heat such materials simultaneously throughout their mass by means of the dielectric loss produced in them when they are subjected to a high voltage, high frequency field.\\" This patent proposed radio frequency (RF) heating at 10 to 20 megahertz (wavelength 15 to 30 meters).. Method and apparatus for heating dielectric materials - J.G. Chafee Such wavelengths were far longer than the cavity used, and thus made use of near- field effects and not electromagnetic waves. (Commercial microwave ovens use wavelengths only 1% as long.) In agriculture, RF dielectric heating has been widely tested and is increasingly used as a way to kill pests in certain food crops after harvest, such as walnuts still in the shell. Because RF heating can heat foods more uniformly than is the case with microwave heating, RF heating holds promise as a way to process foods quickly. In medicine, the RF heating of body tissues, called diathermy, is used for muscle therapy\\"Diathermy\\", Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 10th Edition. Retrieved August 29, 2013, from Dictionary.com website Heating to higher temperatures, called hyperthermia therapy, is used to kill cancer and tumor tissue. RF Heating is used in the wood industry to cure glues used in plywood manufacturing, fingerjointing, and furniture construction. RF heating can also be used to speed up drying lumber. Microwave heating In addition to heating food, microwaves are widely used for heating in many industrial processes. An industrial microwave tunnel oven for heating plastic parts prior to extrusion. Microwave heating, as distinct from RF heating, is a sub- category of dielectric heating at frequencies above 100 MHz, where an electromagnetic wave can be launched from a small dimension emitter and guided through space to the target. Modern microwave ovens make use of electromagnetic waves with electric fields of much higher frequency and shorter wavelength than RF heaters. Typical domestic microwave ovens operate at 2.45 GHz, but 915 MHz ovens also exist. This means that the wavelengths employed in microwave heating are 0.1 cm to 10 cm. This provides for highly efficient, but less penetrative, dielectric heating. Although a capacitor-like set of plates can be used at microwave frequencies, they are not necessary, since the microwaves are already present as far field type EM radiation, and their absorption does not require the same proximity to a small antenna as does RF heating. The material to be heated (a non-metal) can therefore simply be placed in the path of the waves, and heating takes place in a non-contact process which does not require capacitative conductive plates. =Microwave volumetric heating= Microwave volumetric heating is a commercially available method of heating liquids, suspensions, or solids in a continuous flow on an industrial scale. Microwave volumetric heating has a greater penetration depth, of up to , which is an even penetration through the entire volume of the flowing product. This is advantageous in commercial applications where increased shelf-life can be achieved, with increased microbial kill at temperatures lower than when using conventional heating systems. Applications of microwave volumetric heating include: * Pasteurization * Flash pasteurization * Microwave chemistry * Sterilization * Food preservation * Biofuel production Food Application In drying of foods, dielectric heating is usually combined with conventional heating. It may be used to preheat the feed to a hot-air drier. By raising the temperature of the feed quickly and causing moisture to move to the surface, it can decrease the overall drying time. Dielectric heating may be applied part-way through the drying cycle, when the food enters the falling rate period. This can boost the rate of drying. If dielectric heating is applied near the end of hot-air drying it can also shorten the drying time significantly and hence increase the throughput of the drier. It is more usual to use dielectric heating in the later stages of drying. One of the major applications of RF heating is in the postbaking of biscuits. The objectives in baking biscuits are to produce a product of the right size, shape, color, and moisture content. In a conventional oven, reducing the moisture content to the desired level can take up a large part of the total baking time. The application of RF heating can shorten the baking time. The oven is set to produce biscuits of the right size, shape, and color, but the RF heating is used to remove the remaining moisture, without excessive heating of the already dry sections of the biscuit. The capacity of an oven can be increased by more than 50% by the use of RF heating. Postbaking by RF heating has also been applied to breakfast cereals and cereal-based baby foods. Food quality is maximized and better retained using electromagnetic energy than conventional heating. Conventional heating results in large disparity in temperature and longer processing times which can cause overprocessing on the food surface and impairment of the overall quality of the product. Electromagnetic energy can achieve higher processing temperatures in shorter times, therefore, more nutritional and sensory properties are conserved.

Programme history The JCA programme began in 1996 as the Future Carrier Borne Aircraft (FCBA), a replacement for the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier intended for operation from the RN's CVF aircraft carriers. The requirement for the FCBA was set out in Staff Target 6464 which specified a carrier-borne aircraft capable of air defence of naval and ground forces and self-escorting ground attack. As the UK version of the JCA would operate from the two newly ordered Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, the selection of the aircraft was closely linked to the design of the carrier. Candidates for the JCA were thus listed by carrier type: * CATOBAR ** Joint Strike Fighter CATOBAR carrier version (later F-35C) ** F/A-18E/F Super Hornet ** Dassault Rafale-M * STOVL ** Joint Strike Fighter STOVL variant (later F-35B) * STOBAR ** Eurofighter Typhoon (navalised) Following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review the Navy's Harrier FA.2s and RAF Harrier GR.7s were merged to form Joint Force 2000 (later Joint Force Harrier). As such the requirement was revised to include the replacement of the RAF Harrier force; this led to the renaming of the project as the Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA) in 2001. Later, in the third and final name change of the project, the word \\"future\\" was removed. =Aircraft selection= On 17 January 2001 the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the US Department of Defense for full participation in the Joint Strike Fighter project, confirming the JSF as the JCA. This gave the UK significant input into aircraft design and the choice between the Lockheed Martin X-35 and Boeing X-32. On 26 October 2001 the DoD announced that Lockheed Martin had won the JSF contract. On 30 September 2002 the MoD announced that the Royal Navy and RAF will operate the STOVL F-35B variant. At the same time it was announced that the carriers would take the form of large, conventional carriers, which will be adapted for STOVL operations. The carriers, expected to remain in service for 50 years, will be convertible to CATOBAR operations for the generation of aircraft after the F-35 JCA. In 2007, the Ministry of Defence confirmed its order for two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, expected to enter front line service with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy from 2018. =Technology transfer= The UK has invested GBP ¬£1.08 billion in development funding for the JSF. Britain has also worked for five years for an ITAR waiver to allow greater technology transfer associated with the project. The effort, backed by the Bush administration, has been repeatedly blocked by US Congressman Henry Hyde because of his concern about potential technology transfer to third countries.. On Friday 27 May 2006 President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a joint statement which announced: The CEO of BAE Systems Mike Turner, the British contractor on the plane, had complained that the US has not given the UK (and his company) access to the crucial source code of the plane's software, thus making it impossible for the UK to maintain and modify the JSF independently. On 21 December 2005 an article was published in The Herald saying that MPs viewed as \\"unacceptable\\" the US refusal to grant access to the source code. The article quoted the chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee as saying that unless the UK receives assurances of access to the software information, \\"the UK might have to consider whether to continue in the programme\\".. Following on from this Lord Drayson, Minister for Defence Procurement, while on a government visit to Washington to speak to members of Congress, took a firmer stance. He was quoted as saying, ‚ÄôWe do expect [the software] technology transfer to take place. But if it does not take place we will not be able to purchase these aircraft‚Äô, and has mentioned that there is a 'plan B' if the deal falls through.. A suggested likely option was the development of a navalised Typhoon. Mike Turner has said it was not what he recommend, but: = 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review = As part of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, it was announced that the previous intention to order 138 STOVL F-35Bs had been changed to a smaller number of CATOBAR F-35Cs, with the anticipated entry to service delayed until around 2020. Only one Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier would be equipped with a catapult, and was expected to normally include twelve F-35Cs in its air wing. In early 2012 the UK joint chiefs of staff publicly petitioned the Prime Minister to change the order back to the F-35B, on the grounds of lower cost, quicker implementation of fixed-wing carrier capability and the ability to operate both carriers with fixed-wing aircraft. On 10 May 2012, Philip Hammond announced that the coalition government had reverted to the Labour government plan to operate the F-35B STOVL variant.\\"UK Makes F-35 U-Turn to Cut Costs, Narrow Carrier-Defense Gap.\\" Bloomberg News, 10 May 2012. In 2013 the Defence Select Committee would say \\"We urge the MoD to learn the lessons of this closed, rushed and flawed decision of 2010.\\".

He was a high school teacher and coach at Cambridge High School in Cambridge, Ohio, and at East Liverpool, Ohio. Professional wrestling career =National Wrestling Alliance and World Wide / World Wrestling Federation (1973‚Äì1986)= Eadie's first match was on December 15, 1972 under the name \\"The Paramedic.\\" Throughout 1973, he wrestled under a mask as the tag team \\"Para-Medics\\" in The Sheik's Detroit territory. He then wrestled in Pittsburgh, Detroit, WWWF, and the IWA as Bolo Mongol, the new partner of his trainer, Geeto Mongol. He soon entered the Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling territory under the management of Boris Malenko and donned a mask as The Masked Superstar, given the character at the advice of matchmaker George Scott. It was stated that he was an Olympic champion by various wrestling promoters. He challenged opponents with a $10,000 reward to whoever could break his \\"cobra clutch\\", as well as utilizing the \\"corkscrew neckbreaker\\". The Masked Superstar was 6' 3\\", weighed 300 lbs and created many mismatches due to his size, strength and quickness. He had many bouts with Mighty Igor, Paul Jones, Blackjack Mulligan, Wahoo McDaniel, Mr. Wrestling II, Stan Hansen and \\"Wildfire\\" Tommy Rich, and Dick Murdoch. Although primarily a villain, he also appeared as a hero teaming with Jones to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid Atlantic version) twice in 1980-1981. In 1984, he also teamed with King Kong Bundy (also a hero at the time) to defeat The Road Warriors for the NWA National Tag Team Championship (which he had previously held with Super Destroyer in 1982) but was forced to give up the title due to injuries suffered in a mysterious assault (kayfabe). He was the first wrestler (along with Blackjack Mulligan) to have one-hour cage matches, then have a series of \\"12\\" ninety-minute cage matches against Mulligan. It is believed that neither feat of hour or hour and a half cage matches has since been performed by any wrestlers. He was one of the first wrestlers to body slam Andr√© the Giant. Among other accomplishments, he won four Georgia Heavyweight titles and unified that title with the NWA National Heavyweight Championship. He also competed in the World Wrestling Federation against many top wrestlers in 1983-84. He fought against many top level opponents, including then WWF champion Bob Backlund, then WWF Champion Hulk Hogan, future WWF Champion Sgt. Slaughter, and Jimmy Snuka. =Return to WWF (1986‚Äì1991)= In 1986, he returned to the World Wrestling Federation and became Super Machine with Andr√© the Giant as Giant Machine and Blackjack Mulligan as Big Machine. Eadie was the primary mouthpiece of the team. The three Machines were introduced as rivals of Bobby Heenan and his massive tag team of Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy. (The Machines' masks and gimmick were copied from New Japan Pro Wrestling character \\"Super Strong Machine\\", played by Japanese wrestler Junji Hirata). Eadie later dropped the Machine gimmick and left the WWF to head to Florida for a run as the Masked Superstar, upending Lex Luger to win the NWA Southern title. He held the title for two weeks before Luger regained it. In January 1987, Eadie returned to the WWF and formed the tag team Demolition with Randy Colley, formerly Moondog Rex, who wrestled as Smash while Eadie wrestled as Ax. Colley was later replaced by Barry Darsow as Smash, after it was discovered that too many people remembered Colley as Moondog Rex, the character he previously portrayed. Though they began as heels, their unique brawling style and charisma made them so popular that they became faces in November 1988. They won the WWF Tag Team Championship three times as a team of two, but lost the belts at SummerSlam 1990 after they reverted to being heels by forming a threesome with Crush. The trio concept was precipitated by a mutual decision to phase out the Ax character and for Eadie to take a backstage role in the company. Popular rumor at the time cited heart problems on Eadie's part, which have been discredited in recent years. An allergic reaction to shellfish while in Japan after WrestleMania VI was the real cause of his temporary heart problem. Eadie confirmed this in a shoot interview in 2007. Before Eadie was medically cleared, Crush had been recruited as a temporary replacement. Eadie's new position eventually fell through and his final WWF appearance was in Indiana on January 25, 1991 against the Rockers. This event also marked the last time that he and Smash worked together for sixteen years. In the midst of this time period, Eadie also played opposite Hulk Hogan as \\"Jake Bullet\\" in the movie No Holds Barred. He and Smash appeared in several Pizza Hut commercials for the \\"Kids Night Out\\" promotion widely seen on national television. =\\"New\\" Demolition; Independent circuit (1991‚Äì1999)= Around 1991, Ax formed a new tag team, using the Demolition name, and pairing up with a Canadian wrestler, dubbed \\"Canadian Giant\\" or \\"Demolition Hux.\\" They toured with New Japan Pro Wrestling, facing established stars such as Masa Saito, Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami, at the same time that Smash and Crush were still wrestling under the name for the then WWF and on Japanese tours with Super World of Sports. Eadie would then go on to form a third Demolition team with partner Blast (Carmine Azzato). They competed on a few independent shows, then went their separate ways. Eadie also competed on the Southern independent circuit as The Masked Superstar. On August 15, 1997, Eadie was disqualified in a match against Jimmy Snuka at the IWA Night of the Legends show in Kannapolis, North Carolina after hitting special guest referee Ricky Steamboat.Apter, Bill. \\"Names Makin' News.\\" Inside Wrestling. Holiday 1997: 9+. On March 1, 1998, he defeated Vladimir Koloff in Fredericksburg, Virginia to win the UCW Heavyweight Championship. On March 14, 1999, Eadie and Ben Steele captured the NAWA United States Tag Team Championship from Kane and Abel Atoms in Columbia, South Carolina. =Return to the independent circuit (1999‚Äì2017)= Demolition Ax in the ring in 2006 In 2013, Eadie wrestled occasionally for independent promotions and makes signing appearances in \\"legends\\" shows across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Masked Superstar defeated Greg Valentine for the Mid-Atlantic Heritage Championship. The title changed hands at the Carolina Wrestling Classic on Saturday, June 2, 2007 at the L.P. Frans Stadium in Hickory, North Carolina. The Millennium Wrestling Federation reunited Ax and Smash of Demolition at the Wrestling's Living Legends reunion April 1, 2007, prior to WrestleMania 23 in Windsor, Ontario. They began regularly competing as Ax and Smash for the first time in 16 years. Alongside One Man Gang, Demolition competed in the Chikara King of the Trios Tournament in 2008, but were eliminated in the second round by \\"The Fabulous Three\\" (Larry Sweeney, Mitch Ryder and Shayne Hawke). On March 28, 2009, Demolition Ax was inducted into the Keystone State Wrestling Alliance (KSWA) Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ax was inducted because of his success, and the fact that he is a native of Brownsville, PA, also in Western Pennsylvania. On October 2, 2010 Ax made his third appearance for the Dynamic Wrestling Alliance based in Middletown, Ohio. On May 21, 2011, Demolition reunited at Full Impact Pro's debut iPPV In Full Force. Their match against Tony DeVito and Ralph Mosco went to a no contest when local commentator and manager Larry Dallas came out and said his men wanted revenge. The ring was stormed by Manu, Sami Callihan, Blain Rage and Joey Attel. Demolition, Devito and Mosco managed to clear the ring and beat Dallas to end the show. Demolition returned to Chikara on September 16, 2012, taking part in a tag team gauntlet match, from which they eliminated The Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive and Max Smashmaster), before being eliminated themselves by their old WWF rivals, The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and Warlord). On June 3, 2017, Eadie announced his retirement, although he went on to have two more matches. His final singles match took place at KSWA's \\"Brawl Under the Bridge\\" event in the Homestead neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA on July 22, 2017. On August 12, 2017, Eadie had his final match, resulting in a victory in a 6-man tag team match for Georgia Premier Wrestling in Canton, Georgia. Personal life Eadie formerly supported the good work of the Inner Harbour Hospital Springs Campus in Rockmart, Georgia. For several years, the Masked Superstar has made many of his masks and wrestling gear available to wrestling fans through raffles and auctions, the proceeds of which support the general operating fund of the non-profit Inner Harbour Hospital, which has since closed and all operations moved to The Shoals campus in Douglasville, Georgia due to a lack of funding. In July 2016, Eadie was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018. A long time friend of Andr√© the Giant outside of wrestling, Eadie revealed in a 2016 interview that Andr√© was the godfather to his two daughters.

Area codes within the system are generally organized geographically. All telephone numbers are 9 digits long (but always prefixed by 0 for calls within South Africa), except for certain Telkom special services. When dialed from another country, the '0' is omitted and replaced with the appropriate international access code and the country code 27.

Among the Verses of Chu poems usually attributed to Song Yu are those in the Jiu Bian section. Also credited to Song Yu, somewhat improbably, are several fu collected in the 6th century literary anthology Wen Xuan.Hawkes, 207-8  Biography  Biographic information about Song Yu tends to be anecdotal, rather than truly historical,Hawkes, 207‚Äì208 and little reliable information about Song's life exists. Historical accounts agree that Song was from the state of Chu, and was born in the city of Yan (modern Yicheng, Hubei Province), and lived during the reign of King Xiang of Chu (r. 298‚Äì263 BC).  Works  According to the section covering literature and art in the Book of Han, Song wrote 16 works, but only 14 of them have been handed down, such as Jiu Bian and Dengtuzi Haose Fu (). However, it is uncertain if, with the exception of Jiu Bian, these works were actually written by Song. Wang Yi the noted Chu Ci anthologist and commentator also attributes the \\"Zhao Hun\\" (Summons of the Soul) to Song Yu.Hawkes, 208 As a writer of cifu, Song was an accomplished successor to Qu Yuan with his own original style. In the fu poems attributed to Song Yu in the Wen Xuan literary anthology compiled by Xiao Tong (501‚Äì531), the poems appear in the context of a purported dialogue between Song Yu and King Xiang of Chu, in which the King requests a fu on a certain subject. However, this is likely to be a literary device deployed by a later author, rather than an authentic historical record of a real event.Hawkes, 207‚Äì208 Song's name has long been put together with Qu Yuan's as \\"Qu-Song\\". Qu Yuan is known for writing poems with a strong personal voice. Song Yu's main contribution to Classical Chinese poetry can be considered to be the development of the theme of nature together with an implicit sense of inherent pathos.Hawkes, 208 Apart from proving a rich source of reference points for Chinese poets in centuries to come, many Chinese idioms that are still widely used today can be traced back to his poems.

Listed at , Splittorff batted and threw left-handed. Early years Splittorff was born in Evansville, Indiana and grew up mostly in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Arlington High School produced several major league baseball players, including Fritz Peterson, Dick Bokelmann, and George Vukovich. Peterson and Splittorff pitched against each other twice during their careers, with Peterson winning both matchups. On August 17, 1971, the Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 2-0 at Yankee Stadium (in the days before the designated hitter, both pitchers went 0-2 at the plate), and on August 22, 1975 at the old Royals Stadium, the Indians beat the Royals, 9-5. He was drafted by the Royals in the 25th round of the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft out of Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, where he was a member of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity and also played basketball. He pitched for the Corning Royals in 1968 (a year before the major league club existed), and has the distinction of throwing the first pitch in Royals organization history. He went 28‚Äì27 with a 4.01 earned run average in three seasons in the Royals' farm system before receiving his first call to the majors in September . He took the loss in his major league debut, pitching seven innings and giving up three earned runs against the Chicago White Sox. Kansas City Royals Splittorff began the season with the Omaha Royals, but after going 5‚Äì2 with a 1.48 ERA in eight starts for Omaha, he earned a second promotion to the majors. He stayed with Kansas City for the rest of the season, going 8‚Äì9 with a 2.68 ERA. From there, he became a fixture in the Kansas City rotation. He enjoyed his only 20-win season in , when he went 20‚Äì11 with a 3.98 ERA. Splittorff was the starting pitcher in the inaugural game at Kauffman Stadium (known at the time as Royals Stadium) on April 10, 1973; Splittorff earned the victory that evening in a 12‚Äì1 rout of the Texas Rangers. After finishing second to the Oakland Athletics three of his first five seasons in the majors, Splittorff and the Royals emerged as American League West champions in . Kansas City faced the New York Yankees in every American League Championship Series from 1976 to , with the Yankees emerging victorious in all three. For his part, Splittorff was 2‚Äì0 with a 2.84 ERA against the Yankees in the five appearances he made against them in the ALCS. After both teams missed the playoffs in , the Royals and Yankees resumed their postseason rivalry in the 1980 American League Championship Series. Kansas City swept the series, with Splittorff starting the third and deciding game, and receiving a no-decision. The Royals lost the World Series in six games to the Philadelphia Phillies with Splittorff making his only appearance in game six. Never an All-Star and usually overshadowed by teammates Steve Busby, Dennis Leonard and Larry Gura, Splittorff's consistency and longevity resulted in his winning more games than any of them. Splittorff accumulated 166 career victories over a 15-year career with the Royals. Primarily a starter, Splittorff did pick up one save during his career. On July 22, 1975, in the first game of a doubleheader, he saved a 3-2 Royals victory over the Brewers. Splittorff pitched 1 2/3rd scoreless innings to hold down the victory for Steve Busby. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL197507221.shtml Splittorff retired when his effectiveness faded.

The term \\"iotacism\\" refers to the letter iota, the original sign for (), with which these vowels came to merge. The alternative term itacism refers to the new pronunciation of the name of the letter eta as after the change. Vowels and diphthongs involved Ancient Greek had a broader range of vowels (see Ancient Greek phonology) than Modern Greek does. Eta () was a long open-mid front unrounded vowel , and upsilon () was a close front rounded vowel . Over the course of time, both vowels came to be pronounced like the close front unrounded vowel iota () . In addition, certain diphthongs merged to the same pronunciation. Specifically, Epsilon- iota () initially became in classical Greek, before later raising to () while, later, omicron-iota () and upsilon-iota () merged with upsilon (). As a result of eta and upsilon being affected by iotacism, so were the respective diphthongs. In Modern Greek, the letters and digraphs (rare), are all pronounced . Issues in textual criticism Iotacism caused some words with originally-distinct pronunciations to be pronounced similarly, sometimes the cause of differences between manuscript readings in the New Testament. For example, the upsilon of hymeis, hym≈çn \\"ye, your\\" (second person plural in respectively NOM, GEN) and the eta of hƒìmeis, hƒìm≈çn \\"we, our\\" (first person plural in respectively NOM, GEN) could be easily confused if a lector were reading to copyists in a scriptorium. (In fact, Modern Greek had to develop a new second-person plural, ŒµœÉŒµŒØœÇ, while the first-person plural's eta was opened to epsilon, ŒµŒºŒµŒØœÇ, as a result of apparent attempts to prevent it sounding like the old second-person plural.) As an example of a relatively minor (almost insignificant) source of variant readings, some ancient manuscripts spelled words the way they sounded, such as the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus, which sometimes substitutes a plain iota for the epsilon-iota digraph and sometimes does the reverse.Jongkind, Dirk (2007). Scribal Habits of Codex Sinaiticus, Gorgias Press LLC, p. 74 ff, 93-94. English-speaking textual critics use the word \\"itacism\\" to refer to the phenomenon and extend it loosely for all inconsistencies of spelling involving vowels.Greenlee, J. Harold (1964).

Mein armer Kopf Ist mir verr√ºckt, Mein armer Sinn Ist mir zerst√ºckt. Meine Ruh' ist hin, Mein Herz ist schwer; Ich finde sie nimmer Und nimmermehr. Nach ihm nur schau' ich Zum Fenster hinaus, Nach ihm nur geh' ich Aus dem Haus. Sein hoher Gang, Sein' edle Gestalt, Seines Mundes L√§cheln, Seiner Augen Gewalt, Und seiner Rede Zauberflu√ü, Sein H√§ndedruck, Und ach sein Ku√ü! Meine Ruh' ist hin, Mein Herz ist schwer, Ich finde sie nimmer Und nimmermehr. Mein Busen dr√§ngt Sich nach ihm hin. Ach d√ºrft ich fassen Und halten ihn! Und k√ºssen ihn So wie ich wollt', An seinen K√ºssen Vergehen sollt'! Analysis The song is in three sections, exactly reflecting the form of Goethe's poem . On the other hand, Schubert contradicts Gretchen's return to composure in the last three stanzas by obsessively repeating her words to create a second climax on the highest note of the song . The song opens with Gretchen at her spinning wheel, thinking of Faust and all that he had promised. The accompaniment in the right hand mimics the perpetual movement of the spinning- wheel and the left hand imitates the foot treadle. The initial key of D minor sets a longing tone as Gretchen begins to sing of her heartache (\\"Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer\\"). The first section progresses from D minor to C major, A minor, E minor, F major, and then returns back to D minor. This, plus the crescendo, builds tension which releases only to be brought back to the beginning, much like the ever-circling spinning wheel. The song modulates to F major as Gretchen starts talking of Faust (\\"Sein hoher Gang/Sein' edle Gestalt\\"). The left-hand imitation of the treadle disappears and is replaced with block chords, giving this section a more free feeling. Additionally, the absence of the rhythmic, consistent treadle allows Gretchen to lose her sense of stability and reality as she swoons over Faust. This section increases tension with a faster tempo, louder dynamics, and higher pitch in the soprano and peaks at Gretchen's remembrance of Faust's kiss (\\"Und ach, sein Ku√ü!\\"). Similar to the previous section, the music returns to the home key of D minor as Gretchen resumes reality and begins her spinning once more. The third part begins again with \\"Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer,\\" but this time Gretchen escalates in intensity much faster than the previous sections. However, the treadle-like left hand is present, keeping her rooted in reality. Gretchen comes down from this fantasy quicker than before, as she realizes she and Faust will never be together. With a heavy heart, Gretchen comes to terms with this hard truth. The song ends as it began: in D minor, alluding to the monotony of the spinning wheel, and how reality is always present.

She is sometimes locally known as Potentiana and is often coupled with her sister, Praxedes the martyr.  Legend  According to her acta, written by the Bollandists in the 8th century, and the Martyrology of Reichenau, she was a Roman virgin of the early Christian church, daughter of Saint Pudens, friend of the Apostles, and sister of Praxedes. Praxedes and Pudentiana, together with presbyter Pastor and Pope Pius I, built a baptistry in the church inside their father's house, and started to baptize pagans. Pudentiana died at the age of 16, possibly a martyr, and is buried next to her father Pudens, in the Priscilla catacombs on the via Salaria. While there is evidence for the life of Pudens, there is no direct evidence for either Pudentiana or Praxedes. It is possible that the early Church's \\"ecclesia Pudentiana\\" (i.e., the Church of Pudens) was mistaken for \\"Saint Pudentiana\\". Saint Pudentiana. From the church of Santa Pudenziana in Narni, Italy.  Veneration  A basilica in Rome is named for her, and her commemoration in the General Roman Calendar fell on 19 May until its 1969 revision. Pudentiana is now mentioned neither there nor in the Roman Martyrology. The Spanish Conquistador Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, the founder of the modern City of Manila, gained possession of the territory on 19 May 1571. As it was the Feast of Pudentiana (in Spanish Potenciana), Legazpi declared her patroness of what is now the Philippines.Cathedral.org/History/history.htm Manila Cathedral History By the Apostolic Letter Impositi Nobis of 12 September 1942, Pope Pius XII, at the request of the Philippine episcopacy, declared the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception as principal patroness of the country, with Saints Pudentiana and Rose of Lima as secondary patronesses, mentioning that historical documents indicated Pudentiana as patroness from the 16th century and Rose of Lima from the 17th.Insularum Philippinarum Beatissima Virgo Maria Titulo Immaculata Conceptio Primaria Universalisque Patrona et Sanctae Virgines Pudentiana ac Rosa Limana Patronae Secundarias Declarantur - Acta Apostolicae Sedis (1942) Pages js336-337 Today, Intramuros (the walled Spanish citadel that was the nucleus of Manila) still has a street that bears her name.  Homonymous town in Numidia  The name Pudentiana is also the name of an unrelated ancient town and episcopal see in the Roman province of Numidia, which is among the titular sees listed in the Annuario Pontificio.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 956 Two holders of the titular see have become cardinals: Mario Casariego y Acevedo and Oscar Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez Maradiaga.

Launched in 2003, 1Up.com provided its own original features, news stories, game reviews, and video interviews, and also featured comprehensive PC-focused content (an extension of the previously published Games for Windows: The Official Magazine). Like a print magazine, 1Up.com also hosted special week- long \\"online cover stories\\" (examples include Soulcalibur III, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Virtua Fighter 5) that presented each day a new in-depth feature story, interview with the developers, game screenshot gallery, game video footage, and/or video of the game studio and creators. On February 21, 2013, Ziff Davis announced to \\"winding down\\" the site among others. The site was created by Ziff Davis as an extension of Electronic Gaming Monthly, a gaming magazine formerly published by the company. 1Up.com was sold in 2009 to Hearst Corporation's UGO Networks, who was acquired by IGN Entertainment (then owned by News Corporation) in 2011. Coming full circle, Ziff Davis acquired IGN Entertainment as a whole in February 2013, re-uniting 1Up.com with its original owners. Shortly after the acquisition, however, Ziff Davis announced that in an effort to concentrate on IGN, it would shut down most of its secondary sites, including 1Up.com. Remaining staff members from 1Up.com were to be transferred to IGN. Even though the site is still up, some links are down, making the site broken. 1Up Shows and Podcasts 1Up.com had produced a variety of audio and video podcasts, many of which aired weekly. 1Up Yours was the network's flagship internet radio show which featured topical discussions among several editors from the 1UP network, as well as personal gaming experiences and current news items. Though many guests circulated throughout episodes, the show was hosted by Garnett Lee, Shane Bettenhausen, and David Ellis every week that the cast members were available. New episodes of the show were made available every Friday. It was accompanied by the weekly video podcast The 1Up Show, which presented previews and reviews of games, coverage on video game events, discussions on gaming culture, and interviews with game designers. Former hosts included Jane Pinckard, John Davison, Luke Smith, Mark MacDonald and Bryan Intihar. However, since the UGO acquisition in January 2009, many of these podcasts/shows were suspended, or in some cases, ended. Garnett Lee created a second \\"iteration\\" of 1Up Yours, called Listen UP, that featured a similar, but slightly more tight-focused, format to the original 1Up Yours, which ran from January 2009 to October 2009, ending with Lee's departure to work with GameFly. Despite the dismantling of the podcasts and shows, many ex-1Up.com staff have since gone on to create their own unrelated gaming shows, podcasts, and websites, such as The Geekbox (with Ryan Scott), Eat-Sleep-Game and their Rebel FM podcast (with Anthony Gallegos), and Area 5 TV with their weekly video podcast, \\"Co-Op\\" (with ex-1Up.com Staff Ryan O'Donnell, Matt Chandronait, Jason Bertrand, Jay Frechette, Rob Bowen, and Cesar Quintero). In late October 2009, a new \\"flagship\\" podcast was created by David Ellis (previously a member on Listen UP), called 4 Guys 1Up (a title humorously considered for Listen Up! at one point). Audio podcasts included Games, Dammit! and Retronauts. Video podcasts included 1Up.com Game Night and The Daily 1UpDate. Previous podcasts included Listen Up!, 1Up Yours, 1Up FM (previously known as EGM Live), at1Up, The Oddcast (previously Good Grief), Legendary Thread, GFW Radio/LAN Party, radiOPM, Review Crew, The 1UP Show, Broken Pixels, Sound Test, Active Time Babble and In This Thread.

Sarajevo Tango is also the first of Hermann‚Äôs big works done in direct color, and according to several critics, one of his finest. On the surface the book follows a crime story that takes place in Sarajevo during the Siege of Sarajevo (1992-1996). However, in the background Hermann clearly shows his disgust with the international community‚Äö in particular with its lack of action and decisiveness in preventing killings that occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the entire war. Key figures such as Boutros Boutros- Ghali, Yasushi Akashi, General Lewis MacKenzie, and British diplomat Lord David Owen are portrayed in the book as active participants, though often under slightly modified names. The book is dedicated to the innocent victims of Sarajevo siege and Bosnian war.

The Metro Chairman was elected by the members of Metropolitan Toronto Council. New level of government The position was created in 1953 when Metropolitan Toronto was created by the province of Ontario as a new urban county-level municipality out of the southernmost part of the-then York County. It had exactly the same boundaries as the present-day City of Toronto, but originally consisted of thirteen cities and boroughs, each with its own mayor. These cities included the City of Toronto and what were then its surrounding suburbs: the towns of New Toronto, Mimico, Weston, and Leaside; the villages of Long Branch, Swansea, and Forest Hill; and the townships of Etobicoke, York, North York, East York, and Scarborough. Metropolitan Toronto was the government entity responsible for co-ordinating various activities within the metropolitan area, including policing and transportation. Fred Gardiner was appointed by the Premier of Ontario Leslie Frost as the first Metro Chairman. He was subsequently re- elected to the position by Metro Council. Metro's first two chairmen‚ÄîFred Gardiner and William R. Allen‚Äîwere each honoured with an expressway bearing their name upon retirement. Chair's relationship to council For Metro's first three decades, the Metro Chairman was not required to be an elected member of Metro Council, and it was customary for a new Metro Chairman to resign from his previous position upon becoming chairman. In 1987, Metro Council was reformed by the province so that Metro councillors were directly elected to the body. (They had previously been drawn from among local city and borough councils.) Under this reform, the chair was required to be a Metro Councillor representing a ward and could not be a non or former member of Metro Council. City mayors, who remained on the reformed Metro Council, were also not permitted to be elected to the position of Metro Chairman. Accordingly, in the 1988 municipal election incumbent Metro Chairman Dennis Flynn was required to run for election from a Metro ward if he wanted to be re-elected as Metro Chairman. As well, Alan Tonks, ran for a Metro Council seat rather than for re-election as Mayor of York as he wished to challenge Flynn for the position of Metro Chairman which was voted upon by Metro Council at its first meeting following the municipal election. Both Flynn and Tonks were elected as Metro Councillors and Tonks defeated Flynn in the vote for Metro Chairman. Amalgamation The position ceased to exist when the six municipalities of Metro Toronto were amalgamated into the City of Toronto. The newly created position of mayor for the resulting single-tier \\"megacity\\" replaced not only the mayors of the former Metro municipalities, but also abolished the office of Metro Chairman.

A tugboat (towboat) stack is visible behind the middle car. 1912 PRR map showing the Greenville Terminal and its car float operations, also the current crossing A railroad car float or rail barge is an unpowered barge with rail tracks mounted on its deck. It is used to move railroad cars across water obstacles, or to locations they could not otherwise go, and is towed by a tugboat or pushed by a towboat. As such, the car float is a specialised form of the lighter, as opposed to a train ferry, which is self-powered.  Historical operations  = U.S. East Coast = During the Civil War, Herman Haupt used huge barges fitted with tracks to enable military trains to cross the Rappahannock River in support of the Army of the Potomac. Beginning in the 1870s, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) operated a car float across the Potomac River, just south of Washington, D.C., between Shepherds Landing on the east shore, and Alexandria, Virginia on the west. The ferry operation ended in 1906. The B&O; operated a car float across the Baltimore Inner Harbor until the mid-1890s. It connected trains from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. and points to the west. The operation ended after the opening of the Baltimore Belt Line in 1895. The Port of New York and New Jersey had many car float operations, which lost ground to the post-World War II expansion of trucking, but held out until and the rise of containerization in the 1970s. These car floats operated between the Class 1 railroads termini on the west bank of Hudson River in Hudson County, New Jersey and the numerous online and offline terminals located in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, the Bronx, and Manhattan.

Car float service was also provided to many pier stations and waterfront warehouse facilities (that did not engage in car floating service personally) by the above-mentioned railroads. At their peak, the railroads had 3,400 employees operating small fleets totalling 323 car floats, plus 1,094 other barges, towed by 150 tugboats between New Jersey and New York City.

He formed the Technical Alliance and Technocracy Incorporated. Early life Little is known about Scott's background or his early life and he has been described as a \\"mysterious young man\\". He was born in Virginia in 1890 and was of Scottish-Irish descent. He claimed to have been educated in Europe, but his training did not include any formal higher education. In 1918, shortly before the end of WWI, Scott appeared in New York City. Scott worked in various construction camps, where he picked up on-the-job engineering experience, and in 1918 was working in a cement pouring gang at Muscle Shoals. Following this, Scott established himself in Greenwich Village as \\"a kind of Bohemian engineer\\". Scott also ran a small business called Duron Chemical Company which made paint and floor polish at Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Scott's job was to deliver his goods and show his customers how to use the floor polishing material.William E. Akin (1977). Technocracy and the American Dream: The Technocrat Movement 1900-1941, University of California Press, pp. 28-29. Technocracy At the end of World War I, Howard Scott helped to form the Technical Alliance which explored economic and social trends in North America; the Technical Alliance disbanded in 1921. In 1920, the Industrial Workers of the World hired Scott as a research director. Scott, together with Walter Rautenstrauch formed the Committee on Technocracy in 1932, which advocated a more rational and productive society headed by technical experts. The Committee disbanded in January 1933, after only a few months, largely because of different views held by Scott and Rautenstrauch as well as widespread criticism of Scott. Scott had \\"overstated his academic credentials\\", and he was discovered not to be a \\"distinguished engineer\\". On January 13, 1933, Scott gave a speech about technocracy at New York's Hotel Pierre, before a live audience of 400, which was also broadcast on radio nationwide. The speech was subsequently called a \\"grave mistake\\", \\"disastrous\\", and \\"a complete failure\\". Scott had no experience or training as a public speaker. Genesis of the technocratic movement M. King Hubbert joined the staff of Columbia University in 1931 and met Howard Scott. Hubbert and Scott co-founded Technocracy Incorporated in 1933, with Scott as leader and Hubbert as secretary. Scott remained as the chief engineer of Technocracy Incorporated until his death in 1970. Scott \\"argued indefatigably that scientific analysis of industrial production would show the path to lasting efficiency and unprecedented abundance\\".Frank Fischer (1990). Technocracy and the Politics of Expertise, Sage Publications, p. 85. Scott gained many supporters within the movement. M. King Hubbert, for example, considered Scott extremely knowledgeable in physics. There was some discontent with Scott's leadership during WWII and a number of technocrats broke away from Technocracy Inc. and established their own breakaway organisation which only lasted for about a year.Henry Elsner, jr. (1967). The Technocrats: Prophets of Automation, Syracuse University. Radical reform Technocracy Inc. formed in 1931 to promote the ideas of Howard Scott. Scott saw government and industry as wasteful and unfair and believed that an economy run by engineers would be efficient and equitable. He called for the \\"price system\\" and fiat currencies to be replaced with a system based on how much energy it takes to produce specific goods. Scott called for engineers to run a continental government, which he termed a technate, to \\"optimize the use of energy to assure abundance.\\" Virtually unknown today, the organization boasted over half a million members in California alone at its peak in the 1930s and 1940s.https://www.wired.com/2015/06/technocracy-inc/ Retrieved June-13-2015 References External links * The Hotel Pierre Address * A pamphlet of a given address by Howard Scott before the National Technological Congress and the Continental Convention on Technocracy at the Morris Hotel, Chicago, Ill. in June, 1933 Category:1890 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Technocracy movement Category:20th-century American engineers Category:Industrial Workers of the World people Category:Engineers from Virginia ","title":"Howard Scott"},{"id":"1916268","text":"\\"O mein Papa\\" is a nostalgic German song, originally as related by a young woman remembering her beloved, once-famous clown father. It was written by Swiss composer Paul Burkhard in 1939 for the musical Der schwarze Hecht (The Black Pike), reproduced in 1950 as Das Feuerwerk (The Firework) to a libretto by Erik Charell, J√ºrg Amstein, and Robert Gilbert. In 1954 that musical was turned into the film Fireworks with Lilli Palmer. Recordings \\"Oh, mein Papa\\", an instrumental version by trumpeter Eddie Calvert, topped the UK Singles Chart in 1954, and was also a Top 10 hit in the United States. It was adapted into English by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons under the title \\"Oh! My Pa-Pa\\". A recording by Eddie Fisher with Hugo Winterhalter's orchestra and chorus that was made at Webster Hall, New York City, debuted on the Billboard chart on December 12, 1953. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-5552 (in US) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10614\\\\. This recording became a No. 1 hit on the U.S. Billboard chart in 1954. Fisher's version also made the UK Top 10; thus, in the UK, Calvert's version was number one while Fisher's made the top 10, but missed the top spot, and in the U.S., the opposite occurred. Calvert's version was the first UK number one hit recorded at Abbey Road Studios. The song returned to Abbey Road when Brian Fahey conducted an instrumental version in 1960, to be used as a backing track for Connie Francis' English-Yiddish recording for her album Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites. Francis overdubbed her vocals in Hollywood. In June 1966, Francis overdubbed the same playback once more, this time with the original German lyrics for her German concept album Melodien, die die Welt erobern. U.S. television viewers were re-introduced to the song via the television show Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.. In the episode \\"Sing a Song of Papa\\", Jim Nabors' Private Pyle enters a talent contest at a nightclub. His rendition of the song wins him $25 and the admiration of the club's owner, who is apparently connected to organized crime, and predictable hi-jinks ensue. The episode closes with Nabors singing the song again with Italian lyrics. The song has been performed and recorded by numerous artists since its debut, including Lys Assia,\\"Eurovision's one hit wonders singing their way to fleeting fame\\" by Troy Lennon, The Daily Telegraph (Australia), 22 May 2015 Siouxsie and the Banshees (on 1979's Join Hands, as \\"Mother/Oh Mein Papa\\"), Bj√∂rk (on Gling-Gl√≥, as \\"Pabbi minn\\"), Mino Reitano (on 1980's Ciao amico with Luca Chinnici (in Italian as O mio pap√†) and many others. The opening stanza was momentarily quoted in Frank Zappa's song \\"Billy the Mountain\\" (1972) in place of the word \\"fissure\\", a reference to Eddie Fisher. The song was also in the episode \\"Like Father, Like Clown\\" of The Simpsons sung by Krusty the Clown. Lyrics =English lyrics= Oh, my Papa, to me he was so wonderful, Oh, my Papa, to me he was so good. No one could be so gentle and so lovable, Oh, my Papa, he always understood. Oh, my Papa, so funny, so adorable, Always the clown so funny in his way. Oh, my Papa, to me he was so wonderful, Deep in my heart I miss him so today. Gone are the days when he would take me on his knee And with a smile he'd change my tears to laughter. =Complete German lyrics (Lilli Palmer)= The original German version of the song contains passages that more fully give the context to the listener; these don't appear in the English translation. It contains fractured grammar, confusing masculine and feminine nouns and adjectives, as if sung by a non- native German speaker or by a child not yet familiar with proper German speech.

Born in Renfrew, Ontario, he received his Ph.D. in medicine from McGill University. During World War I, Dr. Kearney served as a ship's doctor for various freighters and troop convoys. Later in the war, he became a front- line first-aid medic until the end of the war. He married Marjorie Van Volkingburgh in 1944, and she died in 1954. Kearney arrived in Fort St. John, British Columbia in 1935, replacing a Dr. Brown, the first doctor in Fort St. John. He served as the town's only doctor for some time. He was an early advocate of Medicare, and he did not charge for his services if the patient could not afford them. In 1939, Dr. Kearney operated on a man via radio. Twenty-one-year-old Gordon Stock, in Watson Lake, was suffering from delirium and urgently need brain surgery. Jack Baker, the man's employer, radioed Kearney asking for instructions. Kearney correctly diagnosed Stock as having a cyst on his brain, and informed Baker that surgery to relieve pressure was necessary immediately, as the man would die without it. The remote surgery was a success, and Stock made a full recovery. A school in Fort St. John, Dr. Kearney Junior Secondary School, is named in his honour.

The Stud Stable under Robert Fuller performed in the CWA in Memphis in 1988-1989 Among their feuds during this time were The Rock 'n' Roll Express, Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers, Tommy and Johnny Rich and Kerry and Kevin Von Erich. He also teamed with Dennis Hall as \\"The Avengers\\" in the early 1970s. In 1982 Golden briefly worked for Joe Blanchard's Southwest Championship Wrestling. https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1533&page;=4&year;=1982&promotion;=681 Jimmy Golden joined the newly founded Smoky Mountain Wrestling in 1991. He competed at the Volunteer Slam tournament on May 22, 1992 in Knoxville for the company's heavyweight championship, but was eliminated by Robert Gibson in the first round. He went on to feud with Gibson, which turned into a tag team feud when Jimmy's partner Robert Fuller joined the promotion while Ricky Morton arrived to join Gibson. This rekindled the Stud Stable versus Rock 'n' Roll Express feud from the 1980s. Golden continued to wrestle for the promotion through 1993. In 1994, Golden followed Fuller to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) where Fuller was the manager \\"Col. Rob Parker\\" and wrestled for him as Bunkhouse Buck. He feuded mainly with Dustin Rhodes and then teamed with Dick Slater to win the WCW World Tag Team Titles. By 1997, he had left WCW for the independent circuit again. Golden appeared on the July 16, 2010, episode of WWE SmackDown, portraying the character of Jack Swagger's father, and Swagger abandoned him to be chokeslammed and tombstoned by Kane. He returned on the September 3, episode of SmackDown, reprising his role as Jack Swagger's father, and was again left by Swagger to be attacked by Montel Vontavious Porter. On August 30, 2011 in New Tazewell, Tennessee, Jimmy Golden became the Tennessee Mountain Wrestling Heavyweight Champion. Personal life Golden trained his son Bobby Golden in wrestling with TMW. He married Patricia Ward in the 1970s.

It was ported to the Commodore 64 in 1985. It is loosely based on Celtic mythology. The game was widely positively received by the gaming media. The game forms part of an unofficial trilogy with the science fiction title Marsport and Dun Darach. Dun Darach is a direct continuation of the Cuchulainn storyline, whereas Marsport shares only the game engine. The game has many features that were groundbreaking in 1984 such as a large central character, animated backgrounds and parallax scrolling. Psygnosis Software planned to release a PC remake of the game, helmed by the game's original creators Greg Follis and Roy Carter, in June 1995. However, though near completion, the project was cancelled. Plot Tir Na n√ìg, Irish for \\"Land of Youth\\", is the eponymous location for the game. The protagonist, Cuchulainn, has departed the land of the living and finds himself at an altar in this land, essentially an afterlife. His goal is to reunite the four fragments of the Seal of Calum and place it on the altar, all while avoiding the s√≠dhe. Gameplay Gameplay takes the form of an arcade-adventure with the player controlling the hero as he wanders the land of Tir Na Nog collecting objects, solving puzzles and trying to keep out of the way of the s√≠dhe who also wander the land. Many of the puzzles that Cuchulainn is set are cryptic in nature (e.g. \\"The backdoor key is me\\") rather than straightforward and may rely on some lateral thinking. Because he is in an afterlife, Cuchulainn cannot die and if he is \\"defeated\\" by a s√≠dhe he is simply transported elsewhere and loses all his carried objects. The Land of Tir Na Nog is very large and consists of plains, caverns and forests. Cuchulainn can move north, south, east and west with the player \\"rotating\\" the view using the keyboard and then having Cuchulainn move left or right on the screen. The player can collect any objects they come across with Cuchulainn being able to carry several at one time. Some of these objects can be used as weapons with the game allowing the player to \\"thrust\\" with any item. Crash printed a map of the game in the March 1985 issue, which was later reprinted in Zzap!64. Reception The game was well received. Zzap!64 called it \\"a REAL arcade adventure. The graphics are stunning and the scenery excellent\\", noting the multiple puzzle solutions and large game world.

It is the result of an April 2011 merger of the Hospice Association of Ontario (HOA) and the Ontario Palliative Care Association (OPCA). It is one of twelve primary care practitioner units participating in the development of advance care planning in Canada led by the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association and partly funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Background By the 1980s, Ontario lagged other provinces with respect to the development of palliative care. It was a foundational decade for palliative care in the province, by the end of which two separate palliative care organizations were operational. The Hospice Association of Ontario was more focussed on residential hospice organizations, whereas the scope of operations of the Ontario Palliative Care Association was more broadly represented by organizations tending to dying patients in hospital and other settings. Hospice Association of Ontario was founded in 1989 with eight members; as of April, 2005, it had over 150 member hospice facilities. It was primarily based on volunteer efforts. In 2000, hospice agencies in more than 400 communities throughout Ontario organized over 12,000 volunteers under the auspice of HAO, most through private funding. By 2004, Cancer Care Ontario \\"identified palliative care as a priority area\\". In 2005 the Government of Ontario announced an \\"end-of-life care strategy\\" to be implemented by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to improve the availability of home- based and community palliative care services. The three-year project invested million to establish a hospice palliative care network in each of the 14 Local Health Integration Networks throughout the province, increase home care nursing and support services, and to expand residential hospices and their volunteer networks. In 2008, the Hospice Association of Ontario membership grew significantly, partly a result of the end-of-life care strategy and increased community acceptance of palliative care. The members of the organization operate hospice services that \\"relieve suffering and improve the quality of living and dying\\". In 2009, the two organizations established the Quality Hospice Palliative Care Coalition with Cancer Care Ontario, Hospice Palliative Care Networks, and the Ontario College of Family Physicians. It is a provincial consortium whose goal is to advance and integrate palliative care throughout the province. End-of-Life Information Service The End-of-Life Information Service is a telephone service which offers information about hospice palliative care services and resources, including: * hospice palliative care programs, units and education * community-based services * pain and symptom management * bereavement support services It is funded by the Government of Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.

He was associated with Auguste Mariette in his excavations at Memphis. He became director of the School of Egyptology at Cairo, producing numerous very valuable works and pioneering the decipherment of Demotic, the simplified script of the later Egyptian periods. Biography Heinrich Karl Brugsch was born in Berlin in 1827. He was the son of a Prussian cavalry officer, and was born in the barracks at Berlin. He early manifested a great inclination to Egyptian studies, in which he was almost entirely self- taught. At the age of 16, he applied himself with success to the decipherment of Demotic, which had been neglected since the death of Champollion in 1832. Brugsch's work, Scriptura √Ügyptiorum Demotica (Berlin, 1848), containing the results of his studies, appeared while he was a student at the gymnasium. It was followed by his Numerorum Demoticorum Doctrina (1849), and his Sammlung demotischer Urkunden (1850). His 1848 work brought him to the attention of Alexander von Humboldt and Prussian King Frederick William IV. After completing his university course, support from the king enabled him to complete his studies with visits to foreign museums at Paris, London, Turin, and Leyden. In 1853, he was sent to Egypt by the Prussian government in 1853, and contracted an intimate friendship with Mariette, whom he assisted in his work. After this he returned to Berlin, where, in 1854, he was appointed privatdocent in the university, and, in 1855, assistant in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. He visited Egypt again in 1857. In 1860 he was sent to Persia on a special mission under Baron Minutoli, travelled over the country, and after Minutoli's death discharged the functions of ambassador. In 1863, he founded the Egyptological journal, Zeitschrift f√ºr Aegyptische Sprache. In 1864 he was consul at Cairo, in 1868 professor at G√∂ttingen, and in 1870 director of the school of Egyptology, founded at Cairo by the khedive. He was soon raised to the rank of bey (1873); from this post, he was unceremoniously dismissed in 1879 by the European controllers of the public revenues, determined to economize at all hazards; and French influence prevented his succeeding his friend Mariette at the Bulaq Museum in 1883. He had been made a pasha by the khedive in 1881. He afterwards resided principally in Germany until his death in 1894, but frequently visited Egypt, took part in two more official missions to Persia in 1883 (with Prince Frederick Charles) and 1885. He organized an Egyptian exhibit at the Philadelphia Exposition in 1876. The tomb stone of Heinrich Karl Brugsch He published his autobiography in 1894, concluding with a warm panegyric upon British rule in Egypt. Brugsch's services to Egyptology are most important, particularly in the decipherment of Demotic and the making of a vast Hieroglyphic-Demotic dictionary (1867‚Äì1882). He was buried in Berlin-Charlottenburg. His tombstone is a reused lid of an Egyptian sarcophagus of the Old Kingdom. Brugsch brought some biblical manuscripts from Sinai to Berlin (Minuscule 257, Minuscule 653 and Minuscule 654). The Brugsch Papyrus, also known as the Greater Berlin Papyrus, in the Berlin Museum (Pap. Berl. 3038), an important ancient Egyptian medical papyrus, bears the name of Heinrich Karl Brugsch.

Dust collection systems work on the basic formula of capture, convey and collect. First, the dust must be captured. This is accomplished with devices such as capture hoods to catch dust at its source of origin. Many times, the machine producing the dust will have a port to which a duct can be directly attached. Second, the dust must be conveyed. This is done via a ducting system, properly sized and manifolded to maintain a consistent minimum air velocity required to keep the dust in suspension for conveyance to the collection device. A duct of the wrong size can lead to material settling in the duct system and clogging it. Finally, the dust is collected. This is done via a variety of means, depending on the application and the dust being handled. It can be as simple as a basic pass-through filter, a cyclonic separator, or an impingement baffle. It can also be as complex as an electrostatic precipitator, a multistage baghouse, or a chemically treated wet scrubber or stripping tower.  Types of systems  Smaller dust collection systems use a single-stage vacuum unit to create suction and perform air filtration, where the waste material is drawn into an impeller and deposited into a container such as a bag, barrel, or canister. Air is recirculated into the shop after passing through a filter to trap smaller particulate. Larger systems utilize a two-stage system, which separates larger particles from fine dust using a pre-collection device, such as a cyclone or baffled canister, before drawing the air through the impeller. Air from these units can then be exhausted outdoors or filtered and recirculated back into the work space. Dust collection systems are often part of a larger air quality management program that also includes large airborne particle filtration units mounted to the ceiling of shop spaces and mask systems to be worn by workers. Air filtration units are designed to process large volumes of air to remove fine particles (2 to 10 micrometres) suspended in the air. Masks are available in a variety of forms, from simple cotton face masks to elaborate respirators with tanked air -- the need for which is determined by the environment in which the worker is operating. In industry, round or rectangular ducts are used to prevent buildup of dust in processing equipment.  Dangers of neglect  Proper dust collection and air filtration is important in any work space. Repeated exposure to wood dust can cause chronic bronchitis, emphysema, \\"flu-like\\" symptoms, and cancer. Wood dust also frequently contains chemicals and fungi, which can become airborne and lodge deeply in the lungs, causing illness and damage.

When the Waldensians were exiled a second time, Arnaud accompanied them in their exile to Sch√∂nenberg, and continued to act as their pastor until his death. Life Arnaud was born in Embrun, Hautes-Alpes, France. About 1650 his family returned to their native valley of Luserna, where Arnaud was educated at La Tour (the chief village), later visiting the college at Basel (1662 and 1668) and the Academy at Geneva (1666). He then returned home, and seems to have been pastor in several of the Waldensian valleys before attaining that position at La Tour (1685). Christian leader He was thus the natural leader of his co-religionists after Victor Amadeus II of Savoy expelled them (1686) from their valleys, and most probably visited Holland; William of Orange, the ruler of that province, certainly gave him help and money. Arnaud occupied himself with organizing his 3,000 countrymen who had taken refuge in Switzerland, and who twice (1687‚Äì1688) attempted to regain their homes. The English revolution of 1688, and the election of William to the throne, encouraged the Waldensians to make yet another attempt. Furnished with detailed instructions from the veteran Joshua Janavel (prevented by age from taking part in the expedition) Arnaud, with about 1,000 followers, started in 17 August 1689 from near Nyon on Lake Geneva for their return. On the 27 August, the band, after many hardships and dangers, reached the Valley of St Martin, having passed by Sallanches and crossed many cols and passes reaching up to 9085 ft. They soon took refuge in the lofty and secure rocky citadel of the Balsille, where they were besieged from 24 October 1689 to 14 May 1690 by the troops (about 4,000 in number) of the King of France and the Duke of Savoy. They maintained this natural fortress against many fierce attacks and during the whole of a winter. In particular, on 2 May, one assault was defeated without the loss of a single man of Arnaud's small band. But another attack (14 May) was not so successful, so that Arnaud withdrew his force, under cover of a thick mist, and led them over the hills to the Val di Angrogna, above La Tour. A month later the Waldensians were received into favour by the duke of Savoy, who had then abandoned his alliance with France for one with Great Britain and Holland. Hence for the next six years the Waldensians helped Savoy against France, though suffering much from the repeated attacks of the French troops. By a clause in the Treaty of Turin (1696), made public in 1698, Victor Amadeus again became hostile to the Waldensians, about 3,000 of whom, with Arnaud, found a shelter in Protestant countries, mainly in W√ºrttemberg, where Arnaud became the pastor of D√ºrrmenz- Sch√∂nenberg, northwest of Stuttgart, in 1699. Once again (1704‚Äì1706) the Waldensians aided the duke against France. Arnaud, however, took no part in the military operations, though he visited England (1707) to obtain financial aid from Queen Anne. Theology Henri Arnaud is among the later Waldensians who had joined the Protestant Reformation in Geneva. Death and legacy He died at Sch√∂nenberg, which was the church hamlet of the parish of Durrmenz, in 1721. It was during his retirement that he compiled from various documents by other hands his Histoire de la glorieuse rentr√©e des Vaudois dans leurs vall√©es, which was published (probably at Kassel) in 1710, with a dedication to Queen Anne. It was translated into English (1827) by H. Dyke Acland, and has also appeared in German and Dutch versions. A part of the original MS. is preserved in the Royal Library in Berlin.

Bon Louis Henri Martin) (20 February 1810 in Saint- Quentin, Aisne ‚Äì 14 December 1883 in Paris)www.theodora.com was a French historian, who was celebrated in his own day but whose modern reputation has been eclipsed by the greater literary and interpretive powers of his contemporary, the equally passionate patriot Jules Michelet, whose works have often been reprinted.Charles Rearick, \\"Henri Martin: from druidic traditions to republican politics\\", Journal of Contemporary History 7.3 (1972:53-64) p. 53. After publishing a few novels, Martin devoted his life to the study of the history of France, writing Histoire de France, a formidable work in 13 volumes (1833-1836). He later brought the history down to 1789 in the 4th edition (19 vols., 1865), and received from the Institut de France 20,000 francs as a prize in 1869. The Avenue Henri-Martin in Paris is named after him. Biography Martin was born in Saint-Quentin into an upper-middle-class family. Trained as a notary, he followed this profession for some time but having achieved success with an historical romance, Wolfthurm (1830), he applied himself to historical research. Martin sat in the Assembl√©e Nationale as deputy for Aisne in 1871, and was elected on 13 June 1878 to seat number 38 of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise,Acad√©mie fran√ßaise: Henri Martin but he left no mark as a politician. Redactor at the Si√®cle, he was also mayor of the 16th arrondissement of Paris in 1870, deputy of Paris in 1871, senator in 1876, and one of the founders and the first president of the Ligue des Patriotes. He died in Paris on 14 December 1883 and, acclaimed as \\"national historian\\", was given a public funeral.Rearick (1972), p. 53 A laudatory biography soon appeared: Gabriel Hanotaux, Henri Martin, Paris, 1885. Writings =Histoire de France= Becoming associated with Paul Lacroix (Le Bibliophile Jacob), he planned with him a history of France to consist of excerpts from the chief chroniclers and historians, with original matter filling up gaps in the continuity. In the first volume, which appeared in 1833, Histoire de France depuis les temps les plus recul√©s jusqu'en juillet 1830 the compiler promised to seek \\"always the dramatic and picturesque side of history, the one that interests the greatest number\\";Quoted in Rearick (1972); p. 54 its success encouraged Martin to make the work his own, and his Histoire de France, in 15 volumes (1833‚Äì1836) which spans the space from earliest times to the French Revolution of 1789, was the result. This magnum opus, rewritten and further elaborated during the following 18 years of research (4th ed., 16 vols. and index, 1861‚Äì1865) gained for him in 1856 the first prize of the Academy, and in 1869 the grand biennial prize of 20,000 francs. A popular abridgement, L'Histoire de France Populaire (7 vols.) was published in 1867. This, together with the continuation, Histoire de France depuis 1789 jusqu'√† nos jours (History of France from 1789 to the Present Time) (6 vols. 1878-1883), gives a complete history of France, superseding Sismondi's Histoire des Fran√ßais as the #1 French history of the 19th century. Alas, this monumental work has not withstood the test of time. Martin's romanticized descriptions of Gauls as representing the Druidic key to France's essentialist \\"primitive tradition\\" are based on his longstanding close ties with the Saint- Simonian counter-Enlightenment philosopher Jean ReynaudMartin's admiring account Jean Reynaud, Paris, 1863 rather than on objective history.Rearick (1972), p. 55, noting the \\"extremely hostile\\" account in Jules Am√©d√©e Barbey d'Aurevilly, Le XIXe si√®cle, les oeuvres et les hommes, first series (1861), pp. 97-110 However flawed, his popularized accounts gave a great impetus to Celtic linguistic and anthropological studies. His knowledge of the Middle Ages is inadequate, and his criticisms are not discriminating. As a free- thinking liberal republican outside the Roman Catholic Church, his prejudices often biased his judgment on the political and religious history of the ancien r√©gime. The last six volumes, devoted to the 17th and 18th centuries, are superior to the earlier ones. =Other writings= In his essay De la France, de son g√©nie et de ses destin√©es (1847) he sought to give the French a sense of their essentially national destiny within the framework of Romantic nationalism. Other minor works included Daniel Manin (1860), La Russie et l'Europe (1866), Etudes d'arch√©ologie celtique (1872), and Les Napol√©on et les fronti√®res de la France (1874). Martin was distinguished by an extremely hostile attitude towards Russia. One of his main works, \\"Russia and Europe\\" (1866), which arose under the influence of racist ideas of the pole-emigrant Francis Dukhinsky, Vice-President of the Paris ethnographic society, describes the Russian (\\"Muscovites\\") as prone to despotism barbaric people of non- European (Turan) origin, unjustly appropriated the history of Russia.

He is chiefly distinguished as the author of the 1851 book Sc√®nes de la vie de boh√®me (Scenes of Bohemian Life), which is based on his own experiences as a desperately poor writer living in a Parisian garret (the top floor of buildings, where artists often lived) and as a member of a loose club of friends who called themselves \\"the water drinkers\\" (because they were too poor to afford wine). In his writing he combines instinct with pathos, humour, and sadness. The book is the basis for the 1896 opera La boh√®me by Puccini, Leoncavallo's opera of the same name, and, at greater removes, the zarzuela Bohemios (Amadeu Vives), the 1930 operetta Das Veilchen vom Montmartre (K√°lm√°n), and the 1996 Broadway musical Rent. He wrote lyrics as well as novels and stories, the chief being La Chanson de Musette, \\"a tear,\\" says Gautier, \\"which has become a pearl of poetry\\".Original French: Dans ce volume il y a un chef d'≈ìuvre, une larme devenue une perle de po√©sie, nous voulons dire: \\"la Chanson de Musette\\", Th√©ophile Gautier, 'Rapport sur les progr√®s de la po√©sie (1868), Diogene Editions Libres, 2006, p. 47. Biography Murger was born and died in Paris. He was the son of a Savoyard immigrant who worked as a tailor and janitor for an apartment building in the Rue Saint Georges. He had a scanty and fragmented education. After leaving school at 15 he worked in a variety of menial jobs before securing one in a lawyer's office. While there he also wrote poetry which came to the attention of the French writer √âtienne de Jouy. De Jouy's connections enabled him to secure the position of secretary to Count Tolstoi, a Russian nobleman living in Paris. Murger's literary career began about 1841. His first essays were mainly literary and poetic, but under the pressure of earning a living he wrote whatever he could find a market for, turning out prose as he put it, \\"at the rate of eighty francs an acre\\".Introductory essay to Henry Murger, The Bohemians of the Latin Quarter, New York: Soci√©t√© des Beaux-Arts, 1888. At one point he edited a fashion newspaper, Le Moniteur de la Mode, and a paper for the millinery trade, Le Castor. His position gradually improved when the French writer Champfleury, with whom he lived for a time, urged Murger to devote himself to fiction. His first big success was Sc√®nes de la vie de boh√®me. In 1851 Murger published a sequel, Sc√®nes de la vie de jeunesse. Several more works followed, but none of them brought him the same popular acclaim. Bust of Henry Murger (the monument itself spells his name ‚ÄúHenry,‚Äù rather than the usual French spelling of Henri) in the Jardin du Luxembourg, Paris He lived much of the next ten years in a country house outside Paris, dogged by financial problems and recurrent ill health. In 1859 he received the L√©gion d'honneur but within two years he was almost penniless and dying in a Paris hospital. Napoleon III's minister Count Walewski sent 500 francs to help pay his medical expenses, but it was too late. Henri Murger died on 28 January 1861 at the age of 38. The French government paid for his funeral, which from contemporary accounts in Le Figaro was a great public occasion attended by 250 luminaries from journalism, literature, theatre, and the arts. Le Figaro also started a fund to raise money for his monument. Hundreds of people contributed and within two months it had raised over 6500 francs.Seigel (1999), pp. 150‚Äì153. =Spelling of the name= Early in his career, in an effort to make himself appear more \\"elegant and noticeable\\", Murger signed his name as \\"Henry M√ºrger\\", the English-looking \\"y\\" and German-looking umlaut both being exotic in French.Seigel, p. 35 \\\\- though the spelling of Henry rather than Henri was also archaic French, having been standard orthography (along with such spellings as loy and roy) prior to c. 1775 and not totally supplanted by \\"i\\" until after 1790. After experimenting with other variations he eventually kept the former but dropped the latter, so that all of his best-known works were published under the name \\"Henry Murger\\".

In 1867, it participated together with five other problems, as a set in an international problem tourney. The motto for the full set was \\"Excelsior\\" (eng. 'Ever upward'), generally known as the title of the poem \\"Excelsior\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and as that term is very fitting for this particular problem, it is generally associated with it. Backstory Loyd had a friend who was willing to wager that he could always find the piece which delivered the principal mate of a chess problem. Loyd composed this problem as a joke and bet his friend dinner that he could not pick a piece that didn't give mate in the main line (his friend immediately identified the pawn on b2 as being the least likely to deliver mate), and when the problem was published it was with the stipulation that White mates with \\"the least likely piece or pawn\\".Sam Loyd and His Chess Problems - Alain C. White (p396 in Dover 1962 reprint). White quotes a letter from Loyd stating that the \\"friend\\" was Dennis Julien, and the problem was composed in 1858. It should probably be noted that the first publication, in 1861, is not accompanied by any such stipulation as White describes. Solution 1\\\\. b4! :Threatening 2.Rf5 anyAny legal move by Black. 3.Rf1# or 2.Rd5 any 3.Rd1# (with possible prolonging of both by 2...Rc5 3.bxc5 any 4.R mates). White cannot begin with 1.Rf5 because Black's 1...Rc5 would pin the rook. Now there are multiple possible moves defending only one of the threats and one secondary non-thematical defence: 1...Rxc2 2.Nxc2! a2 3.Rd5 (or Rf5) a1=Q 4.Nxa1 any . 1... Rc5+ 2. bxc5! :Threatening 3.Rb1#. 2... a2 3. c6! :Again with the same threats as on move one, i.e. 4.Rf5 any 5.Rf1# or 4.Rd5 any 5.Rd1#. 3... Bc7 :Because both Rd5 and Rf5 are threatened; the alternative moves 3...Bf6 and 3...Bg5 would only defend against one or the other. The given move does defend against Rd5 in the sense that 4.Rd5 Bxg3 5.Rd1+ Be1 6.Rdxe1# takes more than the required five moves, and similarly for 4.Rf5 Bf4. 4\\\\. cxb7 any 5. bxa8=Q/B# :The mate is delivered with the pawn that starts on b2. Any problem that features a pawn moving from its starting square to promotion in the course of the solution is now said to demonstrate the Excelsior theme. Nowadays it is most usually shown in helpmates and seriesmovers.

It is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List, on account of its widespread range in the Tibetan Plateau's steppes and semi-deserts.  Characteristics  The Tibetan fox is small and compact, with soft, dense coats and conspicuously narrow muzzles and bushy tails. Its muzzle, crown, neck, back and lower legs are tan to rufous coloured, while its cheeks, flanks, upper legs and rumps are grey. Its tail has white tips. The short ears are tan to greyish tan on the back, while the insides and undersides are white. Adult Tibetan foxes are , not including tail, and have tail lengths of . Weights of adults are usually . Among the true foxes, its skull is the most specialised in the direction of carnivory (and looks nothing like the picture in the species box above); it is longer in the condylobasal length and in mandible and cheek tooth length than those of hill foxes. Its cranial region is shorter than that of hill foxes, and the zygomatic arches narrower. Its jaws are also much narrower, and the forehead concave. Its canine teeth are also much longer than those of hill foxes.  Distribution and habitat  The Tibetan fox is restricted to the Tibetan Plateau in western China and the Ladakh plateau in northern India. It occurs north of the Himalayas in the northernmost border regions of Nepal and India, across Tibet, and in parts of the Chinese provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan and Sichuan. It primarily inhabits semi-arid to arid grasslands, well away from humans or from heavy vegetation cover. It lives in upland plains and hills from elevation, and has occasionally been sighted at elevations of around .  Behaviour and ecology  The Tibetan fox primarily preys on Plateau pikas, followed by rodents, marmots, woolly hares and lizards. It also scavenges on the carcasses of Tibetan antelopes, musk deer, blue sheep and livestock. Tibetan foxes are mostly solitary, daytime hunters as their main prey, pikas, are diurnal. Tibetan foxes may form commensal relationships with brown bears during hunts for pikas. The bears dig out the pikas, and the foxes grab them when they escape the bears. Mated pairs remain together and may also hunt together. After a gestation period of about 50 to 60 days, two to four young are born in a den, and stay with the parents until they are eight to ten months old. Their burrows are made at the base of boulders, at old beach lines and low slopes. Dens may have four entrances, with entrances being 25‚Äì35 cm in diameter. = Diseases and parasites = Tibetan foxes in the S√™rx√º County of China's Sichuan province are heavily infected with Echinococcus, while foxes in western Sichuan are definitive hosts of alveolar hydatid disease.  In culture  A photograph of a Himalayan marmot under attack by a Tibetan fox won the first prize in the 2019 Wildlife Photographer of the Year award.

She possessed a sweet-toned, lyrical voice and was a brilliant exponent of florid singing. Life Sontag was born at Koblenz, Germany, as Gertrude Walpurgis Sontag, to the actor Franz Sontag and his wife, the actress Franziska Sontag (n√©e Martloff, 1798‚Äì1865). Her brother was the actor Karl Sontag. She made her d√©but at the age of 6. In 1823 she sang at Leipzig in Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz and in December of that year created the title role in his Euryanthe. Her success was immediate. She was invited to be the soprano soloist in the first performances of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and Missa Solemnis on 7 May 1824; she was only 18 years old at the time. In 1825 she was engaged by the K√∂nigst√§dter Theater, Berlin.Warrack (n.d.) In 1826, she was engaged at the Paris Com√©die-Italienne, where she debuted in the role of Rosina in Gioacchino Rossini's opera The Barber of Seville. She was also extremely successful in performance in England and Germany in the following years. When she visited Weimar, Goethe wrote a poem dedicated to her (Neue Siren). Around 1829 she married Count Carlo Rossi in secret, after which she left the stage until her husband's financial situation deteriorated. In 1849 she was encouraged by the impresario Benjamin Lumley to perform a season at Covent Garden Theatre. She proved to have fully retained her vocal powers.

Its release was preceded by the single \\"Emmaretta\\" and by a long tour in the UK, whose dates were interspersed between the album's recording sessions. The music of this album is mostly original and a combination of progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but with a harder edge and with the guitar parts in more evidence than in the past. This was due both to the growth of guitarist Ritchie Blackmore as a songwriter and to the conflicts within the band over the fusion of classical music and rock proposed by keyboard player Jon Lord and amply implemented in the band's previous releases. The band started their second US tour in April 1969 with little support from their almost-bankrupt American label and without an album to promote, because of a delay in the manufacturing of the new LP. During the tour, Deep Purple showed a remarkable progress as performers and a musical direction more oriented towards a heavier and louder sound than before. Doubts about compatibility of vocalist Rod Evans with the hard rock music that other band members wanted to pursue brought about the decision of searching for a substitute, which was found in Ian Gillan of the band Episode Six. Gillan had formed a songwriting duo with Episode Six's bassist Roger Glover, who was also invited to join Deep Purple and replace Nick Simper. The band's new line-up, identified as Mark II, debuted live in London on 10 July 1969. Commercially, this album was the least successful of the three albums released by the band's Mark I line-up and was ignored by critics upon its release. Modern reviews are generally positive and remark on the variety of styles within the album and the boldness of the song arrangements. Background In late 1968, Deep Purple had embarked on a successful first US tour to promote their second album, The Book of Taliesyn, and returned home on 3 January 1969.Robinson: p. 4 The band was considered an underground act in the United Kingdom, but word of their success in America had influenced their reputation at home, as they gradually rose in popularity and request.Thompson: p. 58 However, their releases had yet to make an impact in the UK,Popoff: p. 33 where their second single, a cover of Neil Diamond's \\"Kentucky Woman\\", had not charted and was retired after six weeks, after having peaked at No. 38 in the United States and No. 21 in Canada. Deep Purple's American label Tetragrammaton Records pressured the band to make a single to match the success of their hit \\"Hush\\",Bloom: p.121 and the band had tried to satisfy that request while still in the US for the last dates of their tour; they recorded some covers in a New York studio in December 1968, without worthwhile results.Thompson: p. 56 The musicians had come up with much more complex original material for their second album and making a song that would easily fit the three-minute range was apparently becoming difficult. A few days after their US tour, Deep Purple settled in with their usual producer Derek Lawrence at De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, already used for The Book of Taliesyn sessions, to compose and record new songs and solve the new single problem. The song \\"Emmaretta\\", named after the musical Hair cast member Emmaretta Marks whom singer Rod Evans had met in the US, was composed for that purpose and recorded on 7 January 1969, after four takes. The heavier and more experimental song \\"The Bird Has Flown\\" was arranged and recorded later on the same day and was chosen as the B-side for the US release. The instrumental \\"Wring That Neck\\" from their previous album was the B-side of the British edition of \\"Emmaretta\\", which was issued in February 1969 and promoted by Deep Purple in their first full UK tour. This was the first time that a Deep Purple release appeared in the UK before the US. The tour started in Birmingham on 6 February with a concert broadcast by BBC Radio 1, and went on as a series of one-nighters in clubs and colleges across the country during February and March. Deep Purple's greater visibility and their declared interest in the British public induced local music magazines to print a few articles on them. But after keyboard player and spokesperson Jon Lord publicly stated that they would play large arenas for ¬£2500 per show in America then come home and only be able to book small venues paying ¬£150 a night, typical headlines were \\"Purple won't starve for an ideal\\" and \\"They lose ¬£2350 a night working in Britain\\".Robinson: p. 5 Composition and recording The band's management organized the spare time from the UK tour to record new songs for a third album over the course of February and March 1969 at De Lane Lea Studios, with Lawrence as producer and Barry Ainsworth as sound engineer. The pressure of the multiple engagements left the band very little time for composition and most of the tracks were written and rehearsed in the studio.Popoff: p.36 Deep Purple was the band's third album to be recorded, even though they had been together for less than one year. According to Nick Simper: \\"Recording was always a problem. We were always short of material, purely because of our schedule. The fact that we were always being chased by Tetragrammaton for material, we never had the luxury like most bands do now of saying, 'hang on fellas, we need a little bit of down time to just think about stuff and try and be creative.'\\" Added Blackmore: \\"That really bugs me...going to the studio, 'right, you gotta turn out an LP, boys.' You know, 'here we go, you gotta write a song...today.' It‚Äôs just ridiculous.\\" The musicians were now starting to fully endeavour to write original material and found ideas for seven songs, more than on either of their first two albums.Thompson: p. 57 Musical and lyrical inspiration came from very disparate sources. The opener \\"Chasing Shadows\\" was based upon African rhythms created by drummer Ian Paice.Popoff: p. 34 The dour and baroque \\"Blind\\" was written by Lord about one of his nightmares. The short instrumental \\"Fault Line\\" was inspired by an earthquake that the band had experienced while in Los Angeles and featured Paice's drum patterns reversed and double tracked. Roman Polanski's movie Rosemary's Baby, which the band members had watched together at a cinema, was the main inspiration for the blues rocker \\"Why Didn't Rosemary?\\" \\"April\\" was a tune written by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore about his birthday month before the recording sessions had begun; it was later augmented with a long middle section of classical music written by Lord, becoming the album's 12-minute-plus final track and Deep Purple's longest ever studio recording.Popoff: p. 35 The only cover song on the album is the Donovan-penned ballad \\"Lalena\\", which had been a Top 40 single for its author in the US in the autumn of 1968. The first new song to be publicly performed was titled \\"Hey Bop a Re Bop\\", which aired on the Top Gear radio show on 14 January 1969. It was broadcast again on 11 February before being reworked and becoming the psychedelic blues song \\"The Painter\\". Although most recording dates are lost, it is known that the band recorded two songs on 17 February. \\"Lalena\\" and most of \\"April\\" were recorded on 28 February, while a new version of \\"The Bird Has Flown\\", retitled \\"Bird Has Flown\\", was put on tape on 28 March. The orchestral part of \\"April\\" played by hired musicians was the last recording for the yet-unnamed album, which was mixed and delivered by the end of March. Musical style Jon Lord was Deep Purple's spokesperson and the only band member with whom their managers talked. As is the case with most of the material on their previous two albums, the songs of Deep Purple mix elements of progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but this time in a darker and more baroque atmosphere. Perhaps in response to British audiences craving more blues-based rock, the band also incorporated a 12-bar blues structure on the songs \\"The Painter\\" and \\"Why Didn't Rosemary?\\" \\"Emmaretta\\" is a pop rock song written to be a commercial single, but the sound of the album is heavier and more guitar- oriented than previous works, similar to how the band sounded live during this period.Robinson: p. 7Bloom: p.123 Lord had been the main writer on the first two albums and his classical music upbringing and interest in fusing classical and rock had profoundly influenced the direction taken by the band. Blackmore compared the organ-heavy mix of those releases to the works of the British progressive rock band The Nice, featuring Keith Emerson on keyboards.Popoff: p. 28 On Deep Purple Lord still had a great influence, which found maximum expression in the harpsicord-flavoured \\"Blind\\" and in the orchestral section of \\"April\\", an original piece for choir and string quartet that he composed despite being hard at work in writing and arranging his Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Lord's dominance waned some in this release as more writing and performing space was given to Blackmore, who delivered his longest and, for some critics, best guitar solos to date. Critics also remark Paice's progress as performer especially on the \\"tribal\\" opening track \\"Chasing Shadows\\", where he had his first chance at songwriting. Bass player Nick Simper later stated that \\"there was a lot of pressure from Jon Lord to do this kind of semi- classical stuff [and] we didn't actually rebel against it until the third album.\\" Psychedelic rock had been another main influence in the first two Deep Purple albums, but it was rapidly going out of fashion; the musicians ceased their exploration of the genre in this album with songs such as \\"The Painter\\" and \\"Bird Has Flown\\", dedicating themselves completely to the trendier hard rock genre in the following studio releases. Cover art A detail of the right panel of the triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights painted in the late 15th century by Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch, depicting Hell in a highly symbolic fashion.Gombrich, E. H. \\"Bosch's 'Garden of Earthly Delights': A Progress Report\\". Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Volume 32, 1969: 162‚Äì170 Tetragrammaton issued the album in a stark gatefold sleeve, wrapped around with a segmented illustration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights. The label ran into difficulty over the use of the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops.Robinson: p. 8 The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted to keep it that way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut One Nation Underground. Release and promotion Tetragrammaton Records had been active only for a year, but was on the brink of bankruptcy in the US. Its initial solid financial foundation had been quickly eroded by expensive promotional campaigns and by failed commercial strategies.Thompson: p. 31Thompson: p. 59 Deep Purple were the label's most successful artist, but the band had not been able to produce another hit single like \\"Hush\\" and their latest release \\"Emmaretta\\", out just in time for their second US tour in April 1969, was also largely unsuccessful and failed to affect the US charts. The label's financial distress caused a delay in the printing of Deep Purple, which was released in the US only on 21 June 1969, after the band had returned home having completed their US tour. In the UK, \\"Lalena\\" and \\"The Painter\\" were performed live on 24 June 1969 at a BBC Radio session.Robinson: p. 10 The album was released in the UK in November 1969 on EMI's sub-label Harvest Records, five weeks after the much-hyped event Concerto for Group and Orchestra held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. At that time Deep Purple's line-up had already changed. The album was distributed in Canada and Japan in October 1969 by Polydor Records. Deep Purple was reissued very few times and only in Europe, often in a set with the two other albums recorded by the Mark I line-up.Robinson: p. 11 The only other international reissue of the album is the Remastered 2000 CD edition by EMI, which contains versions of \\"The Bird Has Flown\\", \\"Emmaretta \\" and live performances taken from BBC Radio sessions as bonus tracks. All the songs were digitally remastered by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London. Touring While the band was recording the new album and touring in the UK, their managers at HEC Enterprises had found an agreement for Deep Purple to support the Rolling Stones in their upcoming US tour during Spring 1969, the first in three years and a certain sold-out event. Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones decided to spend more time at Olympic Studios in London to record their album Let It Bleed and postponed their tour. Thus, in early April 1969 Deep Purple were on their way back to the US to start off a two-month coast-to- coast tour as headliners which, similarly to what had happened in Britain, brought them mainly to small clubs and colleges.Robinson: p. 6 This time their trek also touched Canada, where their albums were distributed by Polydor Records. Upon arrival on US soil, Deep Purple found out that Tetragrammaton had not yet found the resources to manufacture their now finished album and could offer very little financial support to the tour. Contrary to what happened in the past, when the American label had spent much money in advance for promotion and people who saw the band on the road could find stacks of LPs and singles for sale at every concert,Popoff: p. 39 this time the single \\"Emmaretta\\" and the band's back-catalogue remained sitting on store shelves. In fact, the band experienced some economic limitations during the tour and asked their manager John Coletta to fly back home, so the hotel bills would be reduced.Thompson: p. 60 Coletta later commented on how 1969 was a wasted year for Deep Purple in America. Even though their most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple maintained a reputation as a fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond C-3 organ and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness. Despite having turned into a highly proficient band on stage, things were starting to heat up internally, with band members getting more vocal about the direction they wanted the music to go, as well as being dissatisfied with their treatment financially. Simper remarked in later interviews, \\"Once we started making money, the friendships went out the window.\\" He further noted that Blackmore was particularly peeved that Lord and Evans were earning royalties above and beyond the other band members because they had composed the B-side of the \\"Hush\\" single (\\"One More Rainy Day\\").Tyler, Kieron On The Roundabout With Deep Purple Retrieved 31 August 2020 Meanwhile, Lord and Blackmore were tired of being identified as a \\"clone of Vanilla Fudge\\" and were starting to yearn for a sharper, rawer and overall heavier sound, similar to that introduced in Led Zeppelin's debut album, which had become a great success on both sides of the Atlantic, after its release in January 1969. They felt that Rod Evans, with his tender, smooth voice, would not be able to cope with louder, more aggressive material. Evans had also expressed reservations about his permanence in the band and voiced his wish to permanently move to the US.Popoff: p. 46 Tensions were also high with bassist Nick Simper, whose playing style was considered, in Paice's words, \\"stuck in the late '50s and early '60s\\" by the other band members and unfit for the new musical direction they wanted to pursue.Popoff: p. 48 On the other hand, Simper sided with Blackmore against Lord's excessive influence in the band's songwriting and was critical of classical music getting in the way of harder rock.Popoff: p. 40 As a result of those tensions, communication between band members was at a minimum during the tour. It was in May that Lord and Blackmore agreed on changing the line-up, shifting out Evans.Bloom: p. 125 They talked their ideas over with drummer Paice, gaining his agreement to the line-up change. Coletta was surprised when he heard the trio's news, advising them to keep quiet about it until the tour was completed and they had returned home.Thompson: p. 62 =End of the Mark I formation= Back in England in early June, the decision taken had to be kept secret until the promotional tour for the British release of The Book of Taliesyn was completed. Meanwhile, the search for a new singer to replace Evans began and Blackmore asked for help in this task from his old acquaintance Mick Underwood, at the time drummer of the British rock band Episode Six. Underwood recommended Episode Six singer Ian Gillan, whom Blackmore and Lord contacted at a London gig.Thompson: p. 69 Gillan, who did not see a future in his then current band, was enthusiastic about joining Deep Purple and involved bassist Roger Glover, with whom he formed a songwriting duo. According to Simper, his replacement with Glover was initially not planned and was due to the creative togetherness of the two Episode Six members.Bloom: p. 126 Gillan convinced the reluctant Glover to audition for Deep Purple and the two soon found themselves torn between the new band, which gladly welcomed both of them, and obligations with Episode Six for the completion of a UK tour.Thompson: pp. 69‚Äì70 Evans, Simper and Episode Six's management were kept unaware of these events and of the fact that the new line-up was already active in writing and rehearsing new songs. In between gigs all over the country, Deep Purple had rehearsed the song \\"Hallelujah\\" with Evans and Simper to be released as a new single, but it was recorded in secret on 7 June by the fresh Mark II line-up at De Lane Studios instead, with Glover still acting as a session musician. The final show of the Mark I lineup was in Cardiff on 4 July 1969, and the Mark II lineup debuted live at The Speakeasy Club in London on 10 July. The final show played by Gillan and Glover with Episode Six was in Little Bardfield on 26 July 1969. The single \\"Hallelujah\\" was released in late July in the US and the UK and featured an edited version of \\"April\\" as B-side, the final original appearance on vinyl of the Mark I formation. After his dismissal, Evans left for the US with his wife and resurfaced in 1971 as lead singer in the American prog rock band Captain Beyond. Simper sued Deep Purple's management for breaking his contract and the dispute was settled economically out of court. He later formed the rock band Warhorse. The music of the album Deep Purple was played only during the tours of 1969 and never performed again by other line-ups, though Simper played songs from the first three Deep Purple albums with the tribute band Nasty Habits in Europe in 2010. Commercial and critical reception Deep Purple was practically ignored by the music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced up and down on the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors.Bloom: p. 127 Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors. In the UK, the single \\"Emmaretta\\" did not convince critics and buying public and failed to chart. At the time of release, Deep Purple was generally ignored by the British music press, more focused on the eventful Concerto for Group and Orchestra than on an album by an extinct line-up. The album was a slow seller in Europe and eventually was certified Gold in Germany in 1990. Modern reviews are generally positive. AllMusic's Bruce Eder calls the album \\"one of the most bracing progressive rock albums ever, and a successful vision of a musical path that the group might have taken but didn't\\", remarking how Deep Purple succeeded in combining \\"heavy metal's early, raw excitement, intensity, and boldness with progressive rock's complexity and intellectual scope.\\" Jedd Beaudoin of PopMatters appreciates in his review the heavier sound of the songs and notices how \\"Evans sounds more and more out of place in a band that was increasingly more comfortable with stretching itself beyond the confines of pure pop pieces\\", like in the track \\"April\\", which he considers not only \\"the most ambitious thing on the entire record, but also arguably the best.\\" David Bowling, in his Blogcritics column, reviews the album as \\"the least satisfying of their three early career releases, although it can also be considered their most adventurous\\" for its \\"meandering through a number of different styles and sounds.\\" However, considering the growth shown by Blackmore and Lord as performers in this release, he concludes that it is \\"a fitting conclusion to the band's formative years.\\" Martin Popoff praised the album for being \\"stronger, more aggressive and much better recorded\\" than \\"either of the first two records\\", showing the original work of \\"a strangely soulful psych band distinguished\\", with the exception of singer Evans, \\"by its hard-hitting players\\".

The Graces presided over banquets and gatherings, to delight the guests of the gods. As such they have served as subjects for historical artists including Sandro Botticelli and Bertel Thorvaldsen. A version of the sculpture is in the Hermitage Museum, and another is owned jointly and exhibited in turn by the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Scottish National Gallery. Versions of the piece John Russell, the 6th Duke of Bedford, commissioned a version of the now famous work. The Three Graces.] Victoria & Albert Museum, 2013. Retrieved 2 May 2013. He had visited Canova's studio in Rome in 1814 and had been immensely impressed by a carving of the Graces which Canova produced for the Empress Josephine. When the Empress died in May of the same year he offered to purchase the completed piece, but was unsuccessful as Josephine's son Eug√®ne claimed it (his son Maximilian brought it to St. Petersburg, where it can now be found in the Hermitage Museum). Undeterred, the Duke commissioned another version for himself. The sculpting process began in 1814 and was completed in 1817. In 1819 it was installed at the Duke's residence in Woburn Abbey. Canova traveled to England to supervise its installation, choosing to display it on a pedestal adapted from a marble plinth with a rotating top. This item is now owned jointly by the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland, and is alternately displayed at each. The version in the Hermitage is carved from veined marble and has a square pillar behind the left-hand figure (Euphrosyne). The Woburn Abbey version is carved from white marble and has a round pillar, and the central figure (Aglaea) has a slightly broader waist. By the time he received the Duke's commission, Canova had already enjoyed an illustrious sculpting career. Born in the Italian province of Treviso in 1757, he was educated by his grandfather and his artistic talent was quickly noticed, especially by a senator, Giovanni Falieri, who introduced him to the sculptor Torretto. Torretto took Canova as apprentice for two years. The Three Graces, alternate view, Hermitage Museum Canova went on to enjoy small commissions, but his fame did not come until 1780 when he traveled to Rome and found himself inspired and invigorated by the scope and quality of the art and architecture. During this time Canova produced some of his most revered works including: Theseus and the Minotaur (1782), his monument to Pope Clement XIV (now displayed in the basilica dei Santi Apostoli) and the masterminding of the sumptuous tomb of Clement XIII in St. Peter's. In 1793 he produced Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss, a piece of immaculate composition and flowing beauty. In 1802, he was called to Paris by Napoleon I to model an enormous figure of the emperor clutching a ‚ÄòVictory‚Äô in his hand. He would also model a bust of the French leader as well as a statue of Napoleon's mother. The fact that these pieces represented only a fraction of his works during this period make his dual commissions to sculpt the Graces understandable. The sculpture for the Duke of Bedford was based on depictions of the Graces which Canova had previously made, including a 1799 painting, other drawings, and a relief of the Graces that he executed around the same time. In 1810, he modelled a terracotta sketch (now in the Mus√©e de Lyon, France). But it is likely that his piece for the Empress Josephine and later the Duke was modelled mainly on the early drawings and a terracotta sketch model. We know that the immediate model for the work was a full-scale plaster group that has survived and is now in the Canova museum in Possagno. In the Duke of Bedford version, the graces are leaning on a pillar, though in earlier versions this feature was absent. The Three Graces: the Duke of Bedford's version Artistic technique and effect The piece is carved from a single slab of white marble. Canova's assistants roughly blocked out the marble, leaving Canova to perform the final carving and shape the stone to highlight the Graces‚Äô soft flesh. This was a trademark of the artist, and the piece shows a strong allegiance to the Neo-Classical movement in sculpture, of which Canova is the prime exponent. The three goddesses are shown nude, huddled together, their heads almost touching in what many have referred to as an ‚Äòerotically charged‚Äô piece. They stand, leaning slightly inward ‚Äî perhaps discussing a common issue, or simply enjoying their closeness. Their hair- styles are similar, braided and held atop their heads in a knot. The style is elegant and suggests refinement and class ‚Äî there is a delicate beauty to them that is commonplace in Canova's sculpture. Art historians have often commented on the peaceful balance that seems to exist between the three heads. Unlike compositions of the Graces that were derived from antiquity, where the outer figures turn out towards the viewer and the central figure embraces her friends with her back to the viewer, Canova's figures stand side by side, facing each other. The three slender female figures become one in their embrace, united by their linked hands and by a scarf which links them. The unity of the Graces is one of the piece's main themes. In Countess Josephine's version, the Graces are on a sacrificial altar adorned with three wreaths of flowers and a garland symbolizing their fragile, close ties. Neoclassicism and the Baroque Canova's work challenged the baroque conception of opulent beauty; he shows the Graces as nubile, svelte young women. This is not the only departure that Canova's work makes from the Baroque. For example, The Baroque works of Italian sculptor Bernini presents a stark moment in time ‚Äî a snapshot. Bernini's 1644 work The Ecstasy of St. Theresa shows the moment at which the holy spirit pierces Theresa's heart, leaving her in what can only be described as ecstasy of divine presence. It is a dramatic, poignant scene captured by Bernini at the moment of greatest impact. Canova's work, however, is different. His pieces do not seem to possess any real sense of time, they merely exist at a point in the past ‚Äî almost ghostly reminders of a mythological happening or person long deceased. In the case of the Graces he dispenses with theatrics and invites the viewer to make what they will of the scene. This is typical of the Neoclassical movement. In many respects this work was a departure and has since become regarded by many as a benchmark of beauty.

Life At the age of fifteen, he became archbishop of Rheims, but the death of his eldest brother Francis in 1639 placed him in the dukedom the following year. He opposed Richelieu, and conspired with the count of Soissons, fighting in the Battle of La Marf√©e in 1641. For this, he was condemned to death, but fled to Brussels in 1641. His property was seized by the king in 1641, for crime of l√®se majest√©. Reprieved, he returned in 1643 and his confiscated property was returned to him. Hoping to make good his family's ancient pretensions to the Kingdom of Naples, he joined the revolt of Masaniello in 1647. The \\"Royal Republic of Naples\\" was declared, appealing to the protection of France and nominally headed by Guise (entitled doge in imitation of Venice). However, the tactless Guise rapidly alienated the Neapolitans, and wielded little influence with Cardinal Mazarin. He was captured by the Spaniards in 1648 when the republic fell, and held by them until 1652. He made a second attack on Naples in 1654, but it ended in failure, partly because of the presence of an English fleet under Robert Blake in support of the Spanish. Afterwards, he settled in Paris, becoming Grand Chamberlain of France to Louis XIV and going deeply into debt because of his expenditures for horses and entertainments. He was the patron of Pierre Corneille, to whom he gave a lodging in the H√¥tel de Guise. Over the years two women laid claim to being his wife. The first was Anna Gonzaga later known as the \\"Princess Palatine,\\" who in 1639 appears to have been duped into believing that a clandestine marriage ceremony was genuine. The second was a widow, Honor√©e de Berghes, Countess of Bossut, who claimed to have married him in Brussels on November 11, 1641. In March 1666 the Sacra Rota declared the marriage valid; but the King (and the House of Guise) refused to recognize the decision, thereby preventing Mme de Bossut from receiving any of the late Duke's vast fortune. Anna Gonzaga described Duke Henry's \\"good and bad qualities\\" as follows: > Monsieur Guise had the figure, the air and the manners of a hero in a novel, > and his entire life bore the mark this character. Magnificence reigned in > his entire person and in everything that surrounded him; his conversation > was especially charming: everything he said, everything he did, proclaimed > that he was an extraordinary man.

Woody came to Cheers at the beginning of the fourth season of Cheers in 1985 in the episode \\"Birth, Death, Love and Rice\\". Woody appeared in 200 episodes of Cheers between 1985 and 1993. He also made a guest appearance on Frasier in the episode \\"The Show Where Woody Shows Up\\". He is portrayed as simple-minded but good-hearted. Cheers Woody was born on July 23 (like the actor who played him) and hails from Hanover, Indiana, where he was voted the smartest student in school. His mother's name was Margaret and his father's name is Edgel. He and his childhood sweetheart, Beth Curtis, were also voted \\"Couple Most Likely to Explode,\\" as they were both obese at the time. It was later revealed that they always ate, to excess, around one another due to their palpable sexual tension. Woody followed in Coach's footsteps in many ways, failing to understand the most obvious jokes, concepts, and situations. Woody was essentially a straight man for all of the other characters at Cheers, though his humor stemmed from his misunderstandings. Woody seemed to have an off- center mentality, misunderstanding others' comments much as Coach had done. For example, when Bill Medley of The Righteous Brothers appears and starts singing \\"You've Lost That Loving Feeling,\\" Woody asks him, \\"How come you changed your name from Righteous?\\" With the exception of Carla, Eddie, and Sam, Woody always addresses other characters by their honorific. Sometimes this leads to awkward phrasing such as referring to Lilith as Mrs. Dr. Sternin-Crane. Woody arrived at Cheers expecting to meet his \\"pen pal\\" Coach, with whom he exchanged pens instead of letters. Upon learning of Coach's death, he filled the open bartender position, and was quickly accepted by the staff and regulars. He also developed a \\"big brother/little brother\\" relationship with Sam Malone, the owner of Cheers. In the coming years, he filled the void left by Coach and eventually married the wealthy Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson), overcoming her father's objections to Woody's lowly station in life as well as conflicting religious views: he's Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, she's \\"Evangelical Lutheran Church of America\\" (The episode uses \\"of\\" but the denomination is \\"in America\\"). In the final season, Frasier Crane orchestrated an experiment that went awry and resulted in Woody's election to the Boston City Council. He and Kelly were expecting their first child when Cheers ended. Frasier extrapolates on Woody's interest in a political career to the point that Woody becomes President of the United States and shows his displeasure with another country by using \\"The Bomb\\" (illustrated twice in Frasier's imagination as a mushroom cloud). In other appearances Woody Harrelson reprised his role in the 1990 Walt Disney anthology television series episode Disneyland 35th Anniversary Celebration, where his young self in a flashback is played by Branden Maciel. The character also appeared on The Simpsons episode \\"Fear of Flying\\". Frasier Woody makes a guest appearance on Frasier, the spin-off show from Cheers, in the season 6 episode \\"The Show Where Woody Shows Up\\". During a visit to Seattle he reconnects with Frasier Crane, who had since moved there from Boston. After a one-night reunion, the two begin to spend a great deal of time with each other ‚Äì which gradually turns into an ordeal for both, as they quickly realize they have moved on from their past and settled into new lives, with neither man seeing the other's life as being particularly fulfilling. The two men decide to part company on good terms, after sharing a final drink with each other, leading Woody to utter his final line: \\"Cheers\\". Although this is Woody's only appearance on the show, he is referenced both prior to and after this. When Sam visits Frasier in the season 2 episode, \\"The Show Where Sam Comes Back\\", he reveals that Kelly and Woody's first child was a boy, who is of normal intelligence. In the season 9 episode \\"Cheerful Goodbyes,\\" Frasier reveals that at his going-away party at Cheers before returning to Seattle, Woody grabbed onto his legs and begged him not to go. Woody's political career was not mentioned in Frasier; he states at the beginning of the season 6 episode \\"The Show Where Woody Shows Up\\" that he is still tending bar at Cheers.

It has a station by that name on the city's elevated downtown transit system known as the Detroit People Mover. Greektown is situated between the Renaissance Center, Comerica Park, and Ford Field. Named for the historic Greek immigrant community of the early 20th century, the district still has Greek-themed restaurants. Notable buildings include St. Mary Roman Catholic Church (originally built for the former ethnic German congregation of the parish), Second Baptist Church, the Athenium Suite Hotel, and the contemporary Greektown Casino-Hotel within its boundaries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The district is often the site of the Greek community parade in March.http://www.greekparades.com/ History Greektown Casino Hotel with St. Mary's Church in the foreground The area known today as Greektown was first settled in the 1830s by German immigrants, who created a primarily residential neighborhood in the area.Greektown Historic District from the National Park Service However, in the earliest years of the 20th century, most of the ethnic German residents, who had gotten established in the city, began moving from the neighborhood into newer residential areas farther from downtown. As they left, a new wave of Greek immigrants moved into this older housing. Theodore Gerasimos was the first documented Greek immigrant in Detroit. The newly arrived Greeks soon established their own businesses in the neighborhood. By the 1920s, the area was developing more commercial structures, and the Greek residents began moving out in turn to newer housing. But the restaurants, stores, and coffeehouses they established remained. The next thirty years brought a melange of immigrants to the few residential spaces left in the neighborhood. Redevelopment in the 1960s led to the neighborhood becoming the site of new municipal buildings and parking. Realizing the culturally significant neighborhood was at risk, Detroit's ethnic Greek leaders banded together. With the help of the Mayor's office, the streetscape and building exteriors were improved, and additional street lighting was installed.Greektown history from Greektown casino The neighborhood threw a Greek festival in 1966, timed to coincide with Fourth of July celebrations. The festival was a success, and was continued for years until turnout grew too large. By that time, Greektown was firmly established in Detroit. The Greektown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Monroe Street in Greektown Changes continue, and only three full-fledged Greek restaurants remain in Greektown.The Greektown We Knew is Gone The neighborhood is a popular restaurant and entertainment district, having many restaurants that serve authentic Greek cuisine, and one of the city's three casinos, Greektown Casino. Certain buildings on Monroe Street feature themes related to the mythical Pegasus, and such historic Greek structures as the Parthenon, and other ancient architecture. Greek music is played on Monroe Street throughout the day. Well-known restaurants include The New Parthenon, The Golden Fleece, Lakon Cafe, Cyprus Taverna, Pegasus Taverna, Pizza Papalis, and Fishbone's Rhythm Kitchen Cafe. The Detroit People Mover has a station at the Greektown Casino on Beaubien Street between Monroe Street and Lafayette Boulevard. In popular culture Greektown is featured in the video game Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition (2005). In the American cable TV series Low Winter Sun (2013), the Detroit Police precinct is located four blocks from Greektown. Maya and Damon \\"kick up\\" tributes from her bar and from their drug and prostitution earnings to Skelos, Greektown's main crime lord. Seeking to gain independence from Skelos, Damon opens a blind pig outside of Greektown, where he kicks up to Reverend Lowdown (season 1, episodes 3 and 4).

S√∏ften church consists of a Romanesque chancel and nave with two Late Gothic additions: a porch at the south door and to the west tower. The Romanesque section was built between 1500-1200 of rough, hewn travertine, split granite boulders as well as bryozoan limestone.http://www.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Aarhus_1689-1706.pdf. ‚ÄúS√∏ften Kirke.‚Äù Vester Lisbjerg Herred. Mainly clay seems to have been used as a binding agent. A cross-vault was constructed c. 1462 in the chancel as were three vaulting bays in the nave.http://www.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Aarhus_1689-1706.pdf. ‚ÄúS√∏ften Kirke.‚Äù Vester Lisbjerg Herred.

The wall paintings in the vaulting of the church from the 1460s have the armorial bearings of the Bishop of Aarhus Jens Iversen Lange (1449‚Äì82). The nave decoration is from the end of the 15th century, while the tower is most likely came afterwards. Church furniture of note, aside from the Romanesque baptismal font, is a pulpit dating from 1572-88 bearing the arms of King Frederik II and his Queen, a bell from 1656, an altarpiece from 1859, a sepulchral tablet from 1663 potentially crafted by the Aarhus carver Rasmus Christensen.http://www.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Aarhus_1689-1706.pdf. ‚ÄúS√∏ften Kirke.‚Äù Vester Lisbjerg Herred.

In 1672, when Frijsenborg county was established, the church was incorporated into it. The church tithe, the maintenance obligation of the church, was sold at an auction on 5 April 1803, to Sejer Sommer at Haraldslund and to Erik Christian Muller at M√∏llerup. Sommer and Muller sold the tithe together with the individual farms to the parish‚Äôs citizens.

Archaeology =The site= In the summer of 2008, there were excavations at S√∏ften. The study, led by Moesg√•rd Museum, was spread over an area of six fields just east of S√∏ften. During the summer of 2013, there was a continuation of the study from five years prior. At the site, the sub soil varies greatly, from bold clay over sandy clay and clay-like sand to gravel and rocky sand. =Excavations in 2008 = In April and May 2008, archaeologists excavated two smaller fields and a small piece of land between commercial buildings in S√∏ften.Pederse, LiseHein.

All of the airline's planes were purchased used from other airlines, very little training was provided to workers, and contractors were used for maintenance and other services. The company quickly developed a reputation for its relaxed safety. In 1995, the military refused ValuJet's bid to fly military personnel over safety worries, and officials at the FAA wanted the airline to be grounded. The crash of Flight 592 in 1996, which was caused by illegally stored hazardous materials on board, spelled doom for the airline. ValuJet was grounded the next month and not allowed to fly again until September, with a greatly reduced fleet. The airline's major customers never returned and the company suffered major losses. In 1997, the airline‚Äôs parent holding company purchased the much smaller regional airline holding company Airways Corporation, the holding company for AirTran Airways. ValuJet‚Äôs fleet and operations were transferred to AirTran in 1998 and ValuJet was merged into AirTran Airways in 1999. However for years after the merger, it was thought that ValuJet was the nominal survivor, changing its name to AirTran Airways due to the ValuJet management running the airline. AirTran was purchased by Southwest Airlines in 2011 and ended flights in 2014. History =Inception= ValuJet was founded in 1992 and began operations on October 26, 1993. It originally offered service from Atlanta to Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa with a single Douglas DC-9 that previously belonged to Delta Air Lines. The first flight, Flight 901, flew from Atlanta to Tampa. The carrier was headed by a group of industry veterans including co-founder and chairman Robert Priddy, who had started a string of successful airlines including Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA), Air Midwest Airlines, and Florida Gulf Airlines. Board members Maury Gallagher and Tim Flynn, the other co-founders, developed and ran WestAir before selling it to Mesa Airlines; former Continental Airlines and Flying Tigers President Lewis Jordan joined the carrier a short time later as president. The airline went public in June 1994 after a year of tremendous growth with the addition of 15 aircraft since the first flight in 1993. It became the fastest airline to make a profit in the history of American aviation, earning $21 million in 1994 alone. In October 1995, ValuJet placed an order with McDonnell Douglas for 50 MD-95 jets (now known as the Boeing 717) with an option for 50 more. To keep costs low, the airline bought many used aircraft from around the world. At the time ValuJet's fleet was among the oldest in the United States, averaging 26 years. In 1995, the airline sued Delta Air Lines and TWA over landing slots.Adam, Bryant. (November 10, 1995) Valujet Airlines Sues T.W.A. and Delta Over Landing Slots Like most low-cost airlines, ValuJet did not own any hangars or spare parts inventories. However, many of the measures it took to hold down fares were very aggressive even by low-cost standards. For example, it required pilots to pay for their own training and only paid them after completed flights and also gave flight attendants only basic training. It also outsourced many functions other airlines handle themselves. For instance, it subcontracted maintenance to several companies, and these companies in turn subcontracted the work to other companies. Whenever delays were caused by mechanics, ValuJet cut the pay of the mechanics working on that plane.Danger in the Skies. Midwest Today, Fall 1998. =Safety problems= In August 1995, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) rejected ValuJet's bid to fly military personnel, citing serious deficiencies in ValuJet's quality assurance procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Atlanta field office sent a memo on February 14, 1996, to its headquarters in Washington, D.C., stating that \\"consideration should be given to an immediate FAR 121 re-certification of this airline\\"‚Äîin other words, the FAA wanted ValuJet grounded. ValuJet airplanes made 129 emergency landings: fifteen in 1994, 57 in 1995, and 57 from January through May 1996. In February, the FAA ordered ValuJet to seek approval before adding any new aircraft or cities to their network, something the industry had not seen since deregulation in 1979. This attempt at removing ValuJet's certification was \\"lost in the maze at FAA\\" according to NTSB Chairman Jim Hall. By this time, ValuJet's accident rate was not only one of the highest in the low-fare sector, but was more than 14 times that of the legacy airlines. =Fallout from the crash of Flight 592= On May 11, 1996, ValuJet suffered its highest-profile accident when Flight 592, a DC-9 flying from Miami to Atlanta, crashed into the Florida Everglades, killing all 110 people on board. The crash was caused by an onboard fire triggered by full chemical oxygen generators that were illegally stowed in the cargo hold without their safety caps, by maintenance subcontractor SabreTech. The resulting investigation revealed numerous systemic flaws, and ultimately faulted both SabreTech for storing the generators on the plane along with ValuJet for not supervising them. After the crash, many of ValuJet's other cost-cutting practices came under scrutiny. One of its planes flew 140 times despite a leaky hydraulic system, and another flew 31 times with malfunctioning weather radar. Another plane was allowed to fly despite engine rust that went unnoticed during its refit; it caught fire a few months later and was completely destroyed. At the time of the crash, the FAA was in the final stages of a three-month review of ValuJet's operations. The Transportation Department originally wanted to give ValuJet a clean bill of health. However, due to strong objections from the department's Inspector General, Mary Schiavo, the FAA grounded ValuJet on June 11, 1996. On September 26, 1996, ValuJet resumed flying with 15 jets, down from 52 before the crash, after complying with all DOT and FAA requirements. On November 4, 1996, ValuJet announced that Joseph Corr, former CEO of Continental Airlines, would become CEO and President at a time when the airline was in serious trouble. However, its highest-paying customers never returned, and it had lost $55 million since the crash of Flight 592. After the large amount of negative publicity surrounding the Flight 592 incident, ValuJet suffered serious financial problems. On July 11, 1997, they announced that it would merge with the much smaller Airways Corporation, parent of AirTran Airways which was completed on November 17, 1997. Airways Corporation was merged into the ValuJet holding company (ValuJet, Inc.) and the ValuJet holding company changed its name to AirTran Holdings; the ValuJet holding company now AirTran Holdings retained the ValuJet pre-1997 stock price history. In November 1997, the AirTran Holdings announced it would move its headquarters from Atlanta to Orlando.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/914277/0000931763-97-002099.txt AIRTRAN HOLDINGS INC 10-K 19971205https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/914277/0000931763-98-000002.txt AIRTRAN HOLDINGS INC 10-K 19980102https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/948846/0000931763-98-000779.txt AIRTRAN HOLDINGS INC 10-K 19980327 The holding company formerly with the ValuJet name, renamed ValuJet Airlines to AirTran Airlines with all fleet and operations being transferred to AirTran Airways in 1998 and then merging into AirTran Airways in 1999; ValuJet Airlines ends its existence as AirTran Airlines.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/948846/000093176300000724/0000931763-00-000724.txt AIRTRAN HOLDINGS INC 20000330https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/948846/000094884602000006/f10k_2001.htm AirTran Holdings, Inc. December 31, 2001 However for years after the merger, the general public and the media thought ValuJet was the nominal survivor. AirTran, prior to its purchase by Southwest, made no notable mention of the ValuJet past. Instead, AirTran kept a large cache of ValuJet memorabilia, including radio ads, locked in an Atlanta warehouse. AirTran also opted not to make any major announcements on the crash's tenth anniversary out of respect for the victims' families.Huettel, Steve. 10 years after tragedy, AirTran flies on . St. Petersburg Times, 2006-05-11. Fleet ValuJet operated a fleet of 48 aircraft consisting of McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, along with a few McDonnell Douglas MD-80s. The aircraft were fitted with orange seats. Most of the aircraft were more than 15 years old, many obtained from other carriers. ValuJet had on average one of the oldest fleets in America averaging 27 years. All the planes were painted white with blue and yellow trim, with the smiling \\"critter\\" painted on both sides of the plane on the front. ValuJet's FAA call sign was \\"critter\\" due to the airline's smiling airplane logo. At the time of its demise the fleet consisted of: * 2 - McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 * 42 - McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 * 1 - McDonnell Douglas MD-81 (Super 81) * 2 - McDonnell Douglas MD-82 * 1 - McDonnell Douglas MD-83 * 50 - McDonnell Douglas MD-95 (previously on order) Destinations ValuJet's main hub was in Atlanta, and their focus cities were Orlando, Philadelphia, Boston, Miami, and Washington Dulles. Before the crash of Flight 592, ValuJet operated to 22 cities in the U.S. and one in Canada. Most people chose ValuJet for their low fares, such as $39 tickets for a flight from Atlanta to Jacksonville. Accidents and incidents =Flight 597= On June 8, 1995, a DC-9-32, suffered an aborted takeoff from Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport after a catastrophic engine failure which was caused by rusted engine components. ValuJet was aware of the problem, but did not have the budget to fix it and allowed the aircraft to keep flying. Shrapnel from the right engine penetrated the fuselage and the right engine main fuel line, and a cabin fire erupted. The airplane was stopped on the runway, and captain Greg Straessle ordered evacuation of the airplane. The plane was on a scheduled flight to Miami International Airport. The subsequent fire destroyed the aircraft. Among the five crew members, one flight attendant received serious puncture wounds from shrapnel and thermal injuries, and another flight attendant received minor injuries. Of the 57 passengers on board, five suffered minor injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the engine failure was caused by a detectable crack in a compressor disk, on which a maintenance contractor had failed to perform a proper inspection and had kept poor records. The incident resulted in the NTSB issuing an advisory recommending improvements to maintenance rules throughout the industry. =Flight 558= On Sunday January 7, 1996, ValuJet Flight 558, another DC-9-32, FAA registration N922VV, while on final approach to Nashville International Airport encountered pressurization problems. Because of this, the crew pulled the Ground Control Relay (GCR) circuit breakers H20 and J20. When on the final approach to runway 02R at 100 feet, the cabin was completely depressurized, so the captain reset the breakers. As a result, the spoilers suddenly activated automatically, causing the jet to enter a high sink rate, striking the runway at full power and in a nose high attitude. Five people received minor injuries. =Flight 592= ValuJet Flight 592, another DC-9-32, crashed in the Florida Everglades on Saturday, May 11, 1996 due to a fire caused by the activation of chemical oxygen generators that were illegally shipped in the cargo hold by ValuJet's maintenance contractor, SabreTech. The fire damaged the airplane's electrical system and eventually overcame the crew, resulting in the deaths of all 110 people on board. The airplane was on its way from Miami to Atlanta.

Owned by Rogers Media, the station broadcasts a CHR/Top 40 format branded as KiSS 92.5. The station is one of two top 40 stations licensed in Toronto, the other being CKFM-FM. CKIS's studios are located at the Rogers Building at Bloor and Jarvis Streets in the northeastern corner of downtown Toronto, while its transmitter is located atop First Canadian Place. History =The Beginning and Country Music (1989-1999)= On July 31, 1989, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced a call for applications to license a new FM station on the 92.5 frequency, which was believed to be the last available FM frequency in the Toronto market. Who will fill Metro radio's missing link?, Greg Quill, Toronto Star, March 10, 1990 On August 8, 1990, Rawlco Communications was awarded a licence from the CRTC for a new FM radio station. The format chosen to air on the frequency was country music that would target an audience ranging from 25‚Äì54 years of age. Rawlco planned on changing frequencies for the station to 99.1 FM, which was formerly the home of CKO-FM-1, but cancelled the plan after the CRTC denied this. On January 26, 1993, at 1 p.m., singer Anne Murray pressed the button to launch the station, with the CISS-FM call letters and CISS-FM 92.5 (pronounced \\"kiss\\") branding.Country Music radio makes surprise debut, Greg Quill, Toronto Star, January 27, 1993 The station's licensing by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission had been controversial, because the CRTC had passed over an application by Milestone Radio for an urban music station, which would have been a new format in the Toronto market, in favour of Rawlco's application. Milestone's second attempt at an urban station was also passed over in favour of CBLA; the company finally won a licence on its third attempt, and launched CFXJ-FM in 2001. =First \\"Kiss\\" era (1999-2003)= Rogers Communications announced a deal to buy the station in February 1999. The deal would not be completed until August, but immediately after the deal was announced, Rogers took control of the station's programming by way of a local management agreement or LMA (at the time, LMAs were not actively regulated by the CRTC). Without much warning, on February 5, 1999, at 7:30 p.m., the station flipped formats to Top 40/CHR and changed monikers to Power 92, becoming the first city-grade Top 40 station to serve Toronto since the demise of CHOG in October 1995.Country station changes its tune: Focus shifts to Top 40 as Rogers takes over CISS-FM, Toronto Star, February 6, 1999 The final song on \\"CISS-FM\\" was \\"The Dance\\" by Garth Brooks, while the first song on \\"Power\\" was \\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\" by Lauryn Hill. The way the transition was announced to most of the station's on-air staff became legendary in Canadian radio circles; they were taken out for a party to celebrate the success of the country station, then returned to the station, unaware, to find their access passes no longer worked and they were out of work. When the station flipped to Power 92, the station attracted adverse attention from the operators of CKDX, then a dance music station branded as Power 88.5 in Newmarket, north of Toronto, and from Corus Entertainment, which owned several \\"Power\\" stations in western Canada at the time, and who had taken steps towards potentially turning their Toronto rock music station CILQ-FM in a new direction as Power 107. On February 26, 1999, the station rebranded as Kiss 92 FM. Rogers CISSes Power 92 goodbye, Peter Goddard, Toronto Star, February 24, 1999 The station would later rebrand as Kiss 92.5. In its early days, the station also aired imaging material in which an announcer pronounced the name of the city \\"Toe-ron-toe\\", widely considered a mispronunciation of Toronto. New material was soon substituted. Thanks to former CRTC content regulations on FM radio, CISS-FM was the first, and remained the only Top 40/CHR station on FM licensed to the City of Toronto in the late 1990s and early 2000s (the closest formatted station in the market, CIDC-FM, which airs a dance-heavy Top 40 format, is licensed to Orangeville, and is a rimshot from the northwestern portion of the market). The station rode a wave of popularity for pop music acts like Backstreet Boys and N'SYNC, and often seemed to supertarget a primary market of young teenage or preteen girls. In addition, CISS-FM was more rhythmic-leaning than most Top 40 stations due to the market not having an urban or rhythmic station until 2001, when CFXJ-FM signed on the air with an urban format. Station personalities included Jay Michaels, first paired with Daryn Jones as \\"Mad Dog and Daryn\\" and then with Billie Holiday in mornings as Mad Dog and Billie (frequently accompanied by voice actress Stephanie Beard as \\"Suga BayBee\\"), Kris James (a re-hired veteran of the country format, and temporarily the CHR format's first morning host) middays, Tarzan Dan afternoons, Cory Kimm and Taylor Kaye evenings, and Slim hosting \\"Slim Jams\\", a slow jam/R&B; program in overnights. By 2002, somewhat ironically, the station moved to take CFXJ's turf with a complete shift to a rhythmic contemporary format billed as \\"Toronto's Hip Hop and R&B.;\\" The station hired local urban flavoured talent DJX and Haddy, Axel, Kwame, DJ Baby Yu and RG. =Jack FM (2003-2009)= On June 4, 2003, at 4:07 p.m., the station flipped to the Jack FM branding and the adult hits format, which had proved quite successful on Rogers-owned stations in Calgary and Vancouver. Rogers woos adults with death of KISS-FM, Christopher Hutsul, Toronto Star, June 6, 2003 The station would adopt the CJAQ-FM call letters in February 2004 (with CISS being moved to a Rogers-owned station in Ottawa). The station experienced a ratings drop after the flip, most likely because of the popularity of the previous format. However, once the station established itself, the station gained a boost in the ratings. When it first launched, \\"Jack FM\\" operated without disc jockeys in an effort to establish the \\"Playing What We Want\\" concept which was new to Toronto. Though DJs were introduced within weeks of the debut, the station would become Canada's first DJ-free station in late September 2005. At the time, station GM/program director Pat Cardinal cited the move was \\"a result of listener feedback. The audience has been telling us that they want no DJs on Jack. They want more music.\\" In November 2005, Cardinal defended his decision in an interview with Michael Hainsworth of Report on Business Television and stated why he doesn't see commercial-free iPods and satellite radio as a threat to a non-DJ format. Despite the move, the station's ratings would dive from a 4.1 share in 2005 to the 2.3 share range in 2006. Pat Cardinal would be replaced as GM/PD in June 2006 by Steve Kennedy, who had experience with the \\"Jack FM\\" format in Calgary. The previous month, the Jack FM playlist would be adjusted to mainstream rock, with the station dropping most pop songs in an effort to compete against Corus-owned stations CILQ-FM and CFNY-FM. The move put a dent in the music variety that is a hallmark of the Jack FM format and its \\"playing what we want\\" slogan (which CJAQ still used at the time and would not replace until March 2008, when it adopted the slogan \\"Toronto's Best Rock Variety\\"). The move to rock would further hamper CJAQ's overall share in the Toronto radio market (down 17%), even in the male target demographic (down 14%). On December 11, 2006, CJAQ abandoned its DJ-free format when they launched a new morning show featuring Ben McVie and Kerry Gray, the former morning team at CJDV-FM in Kitchener). DJs would surface on other dayparts on December 12, 2006, including Jeff Chalmers and Samantha Stevens. Ben and Kerry were eventually fired on August 16, 2007 and replaced by Jeff Chalmers and Larissa Primeau. Chalmers and Primeau were dismissed in September 2008 and replaced by Carly Klassen and Jeff Brown. (Brown, the former PD of CHEZ-FM in Ottawa, replaced Steve Kennedy as PD on July 4, 2007, when Rogers market manager Sandy Sanderson became GM.) Brown and Klassen would be holding down both the morning and afternoon drive slots by May 2009, one month after \\"Jack FM\\" registered a dismal 2.0 share in the BBM ratings results for the Toronto market. =Second \\"KiSS\\" era (2009-present)= At 3 p.m. on June 5, 2009 (one day after the 6th anniversary of Jack FM's launch), after playing \\"Boy Inside the Man\\" by Tom Cochrane & Red Rider, the station reverted to Top 40/CHR as KiSS 92.5.Jack gets the KISS-off; Station's format never really worked in T.O., Greg Quill, Toronto Star, June 9, 2009Friday afternoon brought a high-profile format change in Canada's biggest market, Scott Fybush/North East Radio Watch, June 5, 2009 KiSS started with a stretch of 10,000 songs without commercial or DJ interruption, beginning with \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" by The Black Eyed Peas.KISS 92.5 is back The Southern Ontario/WNY Radio-TV board, June 5, 2009. KiSS (which would eventually swap the CJAQ-FM call sign for Calgary's CKIS-FM) features a music playlist consisting mainly of pop, hip-hop and R&B; music; the station often avoids rock music, though it does include some Canadian rock artists to meet Canadian content regulations. KiSS competes head-on with Toronto area stations CKFM-FM, CIDC-FM (which airs a rhythmic contemporary format, and is based in the suburbs), and Urban-formatted CFXJ-FM, as well as, to a lesser extent, Toronto hot AC station CHUM-FM, and top 40 station WKSE in Buffalo. It was announced on July 8, 2009 that ET Canada's Roz Weston will be hosting the new morning show, along with Mocha, formerly of CKBT-FM in Kitchener. Both were formerly co-hosts and producers of Mad Dog & Billie during the station's first Top 40 incarnation. Maurie Sherman (Damnit Maurie) joined the show as Senior Producer/Reporter in March 2011. Beginning in January 2010, CKIS-FM would offer \\"Commercial Free Mondays\\", a campaign patterned after many Top 40 stations across the United States, and offer hourly prize giveaways. (CKIS followed Edmonton's CHBN-FM as the 2nd station in Canada to offer a whole day commercial-free; KiSS competitor CIDC-FM would follow suit one month later with a promotion they label as \\"The Zone,\\" also on Mondays.) In February 2011, the station moved towards a more mainstream direction. Their main rival CIDC- FM began leaning towards rhythmic at the same time. This happened most likely because CKIS began beating CIDC in the ratings, although CIDC's signal covers most Greater Toronto Area suburbs (as well as their studios also located in west Toronto), while CKIS targets the City of Toronto itself. In 2013, the station's DJ Clymaxxx and Mocha won their 2nd consecutive Stylus Award for \\"Radio Mixshow DJs of the Year\\" for Set It Off. HD Radio In April 2016, the CRTC granted approval for CKIS to utilize HD Radio operations. On June 27, CKIS added simulcasts of CFTR and CJCL on their HD2 and HD3 sub-channels, respectively.http://hdradio.com/canada/find-hd-radio-canadian-station HD Radio Stations in Canada References External links  Kis Kis Kis Category:Radio stations established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in Ontario ","title":"CKIS-FM"},{"id":"1916509","text":"Molecules in a fluid constantly collide off each other.

The college opened its first satellite campus in Calgary in 2006 in partnership with the Calgary Stampede Board. Total student enrollment for the 2008‚Äì2009 year was 1,350. The college is a member of the Alberta Rural Development Network. History In 1913, the Alberta provincial government established three demonstration farms near Olds, Fairview, and near the Vermilion townsite. The Olds farm later became known as Olds Agricultural College. In 1963, the name was changed to Olds Agricultural and Vocational College to reflect course offerings which were expanding beyond agriculture. In 1970, the name was simplified to Olds College. In addition, provincial administration of the college was moved from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Advanced Education at that time. Campus Olds College Olds College Building Olds College has two campuses. The main campus, located on the eastern edge of the township of Olds, accommodates the majority of enrolled students. The campus covers over 2,000 acres (810 ha) and includes a number of buildings designed to support the specialized programming offered at Olds College. Animal Health Building is home to the National Meat Training Centre at Olds College, and the Animal Health Technology program, including housing facilities for small animals, and research and veterinary facilities. Ralph Klein Centre is home to the Community Learning Campus, The CLC Fitness Centre, the Olds High School, and also has government administration offices. The facility was named after the late Ralph Klein, former premier of Alberta. The Ralph Klein Centre is also home to the Olds College Broncos, and where they host the majority of their games. Land Sciences Building. The Land Sciences building is connected to the Greenhouses and Landscape Pavilion, and features classrooms, typically in use by Horticulture and Land & Environment Classes, as well as offices for faculty in those programs. Land Sciences (LSC) and James Murray Building (JMB) host the Land Agent, Land Analyst and Land & Water Resources Programs. Here students can specialize in programs like the Environmental Stewardship & Rural Planning Major, a program that is accredited by CACPT (Canadian Association for Certified Planning Technicians). Planning students attend regular field schools in the area or at the Mountain View County Planning Offices, just south of Olds. The highlight of the Land Sciences Building is the atrium, a glass seating area filled with vegetation. The atrium occasionally hosts special events. The Trans-Canada Theatre opened in late 2008. The facility offers a 350+ seat theatre which is used for community events, high school drama productions and more. This provides a wide range of learning opportunities for high school students as well as Olds College students, who produce fashion apparel for the productions, create stage sets, and more. This building is also home to the Pre-Employment Hair Stylist program, offered in partnership between Olds College and Chinook‚Äôs Edge School Division. The Olds College campus is home to the Frank Grisdale Hall residence, which hosts 350 students, and a number of townhouses available to second and third year students.

Commissioned in 1760, it was built in the London workshops of Samuel Butler. It was commissioned for ¬£7,562(¬£1.5 million = US$1.98 million in 2018, adjusted for inflation). This coach has been used at the coronation of every British monarch since George IV. The coach's great age, weight, and lack of manoeuvrability have limited its use to grand state occasions such as coronations, royal weddings, and the jubilees of a monarch. The coach is housed at the Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace. It is on view for the public. Description As the heaviest of the royal coaches, the Gold State Coach is an eight horse-drawn carriage A close up of the artwork by Giovanni Cipriani The coach weighs four tons and is long and high. It is gilded and features painted panels by Giovanni Battista Cipriani and rich gilded sculpture including three cherubs on the roof (representing England, Ireland and Scotland) and four tritons, one at each corner (representing Britain's imperial power). The body of the coach is slung by braces covered with Morocco leather and decorated with gilt buckles. The interior is lined with velvet and satin. The sculptor Sir Joseph Wilton produced the elaborate carvings on the coach. The roof supports three cherubs representing the union of England, Scotland and Ireland. They carry the Imperial Crown and hold the sword, scepter and the badge representing Knighthood. The branches of eight gilded palm trees frame the roof. Four corner trees rise from a lion's head and are decorated with symbols of Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War with France. The war was drawing to a close when the coach was built in 1762. Morocco leather straps support the body of the coach and are held by four Triton, mythical sea-gods with a man's head and a dolphin's tail. At the front wheels, the tritons seem to be using the straps to pull the coach. They are blowing conchs, trumpet-like shells to herald the arrival of the Monarch of the Ocean. Gilded dolphins hold in place the bar by which the coach is drawn, and the driver's foot board (no longer used) is in the shape of a scallop shell. The two tritons at the back carry imperial symbols, representing Britain's maritime traditions and status as a dominant sea power. The carvings give the Gold Coach the air of a triumphant chariot, reflecting England's powerful position in the world at the time. The Gold State Coach is pulled by a team of eight horses wearing the Red Morocco harness. Originally driven by a coachman, the eight horses are now postilion- ridden in four pairs. The coach is so heavy it can only be pulled at a walk. The coach has (gilded) brakes, which are operated by the grooms. As the coach is suspended from braces, it lacks more modern comfort. Modern coaches such as the Australian State Coach and the Diamond Jubilee State Coach have electric windows, heating and hydraulic stabilizers. In the words of King William IV, a former naval officer, being driven in the Gold State Coach was like being on board a ship \\"tossing in a rough sea\\". Queen Victoria complained of the \\"distressing oscillation\\" of the cabin. She would often refuse to ride in the Gold State Coach. A later monarch, King George VI said that his journey from the palace to Westminster Abbey for his coronation was \\"one of the most uncomfortable rides I have ever had in my life\\". Queen Elizabeth II, referred to her coronation journey in the coach as \\"horrible\\" and \\"not very comfortable\\", which is possibly why it was not used for her Diamond Jubilee, when she was aged 86, having previously featured in her Silver and Golden Jubilee celebrations. King George VI had the coach overhauled after the Second World War to rubberize the iron-bound wheels. This would afford at least some comfort to the passengers. The coach is managed by four postilions, nine walking grooms (one of whom walks behind the coach), six footmen, and four Yeoman of the Guard carrying their long partisans. Eight of the grooms walk beside the horses. The more ornately dressed footmen walk beside the body of the coach. The postilions have to handle the horses when the animals are unruly, and they carry crooked walking-sticks to hold up the traces that may become slack when the coach is taking a corner.Newspaper clipping from 1953 Seen on 1 August 2014. The royal coachmen are traditionally clean-shaven. The horses are always Windsor Greys.

It is part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The park has been closed since April 7, 2020 due to the Coronavirus pandemic.https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=629 The park is located adjacent to the community of Topanga, within the City of Los Angeles. Covering 11,000 acres (45 km¬≤), with thirty-six miles of trails and unimproved roads, the park's boundaries stretch from Topanga Canyon to Pacific Palisades and Mullholland Drive. There are more than 60 trail entrances. Topanga State Park is not only the largest park in the Santa Monica Mountains, but it's also considered to be the largest park located in the limits of a city. History of area ;Native American The word Topanga is an old Shoshonean language word meaning 'above' and referring to the canyon settlement being above the flood waters of Topanga Creek. The Tongva and Chumash peoples inhabited the area for thousands of years. The land of Topanga Canyon was originally inhabited by Native American groups collectively referred to as the Topanga Culture, including the Chumash and Tongva. ;Colonial Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first claimed California for Spain in 1542. The Topanga region was not invaded until after the establishment of the Pueblo de Los Angeles and Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a in the late 1700s. When Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, control of Alta California went to the new government. In 1828 the Mexican Governor of Alta California granted Francisco Sepulveda provisional title to the more than 30,000 acres called Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica. The rancho included the eastern portion of the City of Santa Monica, Santa Monica Canyon, and the mountains to the ridgeline on the west bank of Topanga Creek. The land remained relatively unused, except for flat portions used for crops and grazing. The steeper sections were deemed unusable, even for sheep and cattle. Trippet Ranch area of the park. ;American California became part of the United States in 1848, and a state in 1850. Eventually ownership of the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica Mexican land grant was confirmed by the U.S. Land Claims Commission. The land was made available under the Homestead Act. Among the many homestead patents filed in the Santa Monica Mountains, the one filed by a beekeeper named McAtee was for the western edge of the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica, and area along what became Entrada Road, the current main entrance to Topanga State Park. In the 1920s, the canyon became a popular weekend get-away destination for residents of growing Los Angeles. Summer cabins were built along Topanga Creek and throughout the area in subdivisions in the surrounding hills. In this same trend, in 1917, Oscar A. Trippet, Sr. bought half of the McAtee homestead, which he and his family used as a get-away from the city. When Trippet died in 1923, his son, Oscar Jr., commissioned Los Angeles architect Summer Spaulding to build the superintendent's house, horse stables, and a skeet lodge. A stock pond was also built which is still located inside the park at the northeast corner of the parking lot. The Trippet family owned of the land until 1963 when it was sold to a developer. The next year, 1964, a park bond was approved by voters to purchase Trippet Ranch and some adjoined land. Topanga State Park was opened to the public in 1974. Its land includes more than 7,500 acres from the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica land grant. Additional acreage has been added in the form of 1,500 acres from the Palisades Highlands and another 1,600 acres added in 2002, near the mouth of the Topanga Creek. Sunset on the trail to Trippet Ranch. Natural history Geologically, the park has many sedimentary sandstone rock formations, marine fossils, exposed faults, and volcanic intrusions. =Flora= The primary habitats in the park are of the Coastal sage scrub and montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregions. In Trippet Ranch there is a significant area of California oak woodland. The smaller habitats include bay laurel woodland (Umbellularia californica), walnut woodland (Juglans californica), and grassland savannah. The various types of plants and habitats are due to microclimate differences across the park. =Fauna= There are over eighty mammal species and more than sixty reptile and amphibian species. Snakes present include the Southern Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus helleri). Topanga State Park is home to many species of migratory and resident bird species. =Topanga Nature Center= The Topanga Nature Center houses a collection of mounted native animals and birds, as well as hands-on displays of natural artifacts. It is dedicated to the flora, fauna and geography of the area. The Center is located in the lodge formerly used by Trippet Ranch for skeet shooting, a short walk from the Trippet Ranch parking lot, and is currently open on Sunday afternoons only.  Recreation  Points of interest in the park include: Eagle Rock, Eagle Spring Trail, and Hub Junction. Three historical attractions of the park are Trippet Ranch buildings, Will Roger's cabin, and the Josepho Barn. =Trails= Many trails exist within the park, which are accessible to hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders, as posted. The primary trailheads are at the Trippet Ranch area, including for the Musch Trail, passing prominent Eagle Rock. Many trails also are wider dirt fire roads. Unpaved portions of Mulholland Drive are accessible through the Temescal Fire Road and Mulholland Drive. The Backbone Trail System, a multi-use long-distance trail spanning nearly 70 miles across the Santa Monica Mountains, passes through Topanga State Park. It can be accessed via the Trippet Ranch trailhead. The Santa Inez Trail is accessible from Trippet Ranch on the west, or the Palisades Highlands neighborhood on the east. The trail's lower section follows Santa Inez Creek through riparian habitats, and then climbs through unique and massive sandstone formations to the Topanga Fire Road and Trippet Ranch. Funding =California Department of Parks and Recreation= While never actually closed to the public, Topanga State Park was on a list of 48 California state parks proposed in January 2008 for closure by California's then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program. In protest, environmentalists and area residents collected more than 17,000 signatures asking that the closure idea be halted, with the petition delivered to the governor by a symbolic delegation of school children. This direct public action was credited with averting the proposed closure. In July 2012, it was reported that nearly $54 million in \\"hidden\\" funds was in the possession of California's state park system, creating widespread anger. The funds were more than enough to have covered any of the alleged state park budget shortfalls, and State Parks Director Ruth Coleman, in charge for a decade, resigned her position, with her second in command being fired. Coleman denied any knowledge of the secret assets. Later, the $54 million figure was reported to be misrepresented, with the actual hidden surplus amounting to $20 million, still enough to cover the alleged shortfall that had prompted the plans to close as many as 70 California state parks. In February 2013 it was revealed that the approximately $20 million had been hidden for as long as 20 years by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. =Federal trail improvements= In August 2012, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that he secured federal funds to help improve parks and public areas. His first project was to help restore sections of the 65 mile Backbone Trail, one of the most popular trails in the park and the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Congressman said, \\"The Backbone Trail provides thousands of hikers, bicyclists and other outdoor enthusiasts with an unparalleled recreational experience through the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains. These improvements will enhance that experience and improve safety for everyone that uses this popular trail.\\" The money is going to go to clearing back brush on the trails, fixing and preventing landslides along the trail, and repairing the Chicken Bridge in the park. Hikers have reported significant improvements to the trails, and the project was completed in 2013.

Institutional Initiatives  There has been a push to focus on the upstream production process to reduce toxins. The idea is to regulate emissions in the early phase of the production process rather than controlling pollution results once the toxins are released into the environment. Governments, private companies and local communities are being brought together to find ways to reduce pollution output rather than pollution control.Brian, Mayer (2002). \\"Moving Further Upstream: From Toxics Reduction to the Precautionary Principle\\".

For example, private companies such as PaperWorks Packaging Group from Ontario, Canada have taken initiative to reduce toxic elements in the production process. The company was using toxic materials in the cleaning solutions which would escape into the atmosphere.

While some businesses found that by switching to a different chemical instead of the toxic ones, some other companies have not changed their production processes or invested in ways to reduce toxic chemical usage because they are unsure if they will make a large enough profit. Some businesses claim that it is too costly to run a business using alternative chemicals. Other reasons why businesses have not necessarily switched over to a different alternative chemical in lieu of the toxic one could be a lack of knowledge that an alternative exists or the fact that the alternative may not have been created yet.

The Lord Lyon King of Arms who is the Scottish official with responsibility for regulating heraldry in that country, issuing new grants of coats of arms, and serving as the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon, recognizes under Scottish law the Chief of Clan MacDougall. The MacDougall chiefs share a common ancestry with the chiefs of Clan Donald in descent from Somerled of the 12th century. In the 13th century the Clan MacDougall whose chiefs were the original Lords of Argyll and later Lords of Lorne was the most powerful clan in the Western Highlands. During the Wars of Scottish Independence the MacDougalls sided with the Clan Comyn whose chiefs rivaled Robert the Bruce for the Scottish Crown and this resulted in clan battles between the MacDougalls and Bruce. This marked the MacDougall's fall from power and led to the rise of their relatives, the Clan Donald, who had supported Bruce and also the rise to power of the Clan Campbell who were the habitual enemies of the MacDougalls and Clan Donald. The MacDougalls supported the House of Stuart during the Scottish Civil War of the 17th century and during the Jacobite risings of the 18th century. History =Origins= The Clan MacDougall takes its name from Dougall, the son of Somerled. After Somerled's death at the Battle of Renfrew in 1164, Dougall held most of Argyll as well as the islands of Mull, Lismore, Jura, Tiree, Coll and others.Way of Plean (1994) pp. 216-217. The Celtic first name Dougall, or Dugald is derived from the Gaelic dubh-gall, which means black stranger. Dougall's royal descent was acknowledged by the king of Norway and Dougall himself was styled as 'King of the South Isles and Lord of Lorne'. One of Dougall's sons seems to have been √ìspakr-H√°kon, a man installed as King of the Isles by H√°kon H√°konarson, King of Norway in 1230.McDonald (1997) pp. 88-91. A certain son of Dougall was Duncan, who was in turn the father of Ewan. Duncan and Ewan built many castles to defend their territory. These included Dunstaffnage Castle, Dunollie Castle and Duntrune Castle on the main land. Whilst on the islands they built Aros Castle, Cairnburgh Castle, Dunchonnel Castle and Coeffin Castle. Dunollie Castle is believed to have been fortified since the 6th century and became the seat of the chief of Clan MacDougall. Duncan also built Ardchattan Priory and it was here that the MacDougall chiefs were buried until 1737. =Scottish- Norwegian War= Ewan's possessions on the islands were held from the king of Norway, whilst his possessions on the mainland were held from the king of Scotland. This made it hard for him to remain loyal to both. In 1263 Haakon IV of Norway arrived with a huge fleet off the coast of Oban for an invasion of the west coast of Scotland. However, Ewan decided not to join the invasion and thanks to old blood ties Haakon left him in peace. The Battle of Largs then took place and Ewan joined the side of Scots and attacked part of the Norse fleet. The Vikings were utterly defeated and three years later Norway ceded all of the Hebrides to Scotland. =Wars of Scottish Independence= The MacDougall Cross, dating from about 1500 at Ardchattan Priory. The MacDougall's influence in Argyll brought them into conflict with the Clan Campbell. In 1294 John MacDougall of Argyll led the Clan MacDougall against the Clan Campbell at the Battle of Red Ford, where Sir Colin Campbell was killed but there were considerable losses on both sides. The fourth chief of Clan MacDougall married a sister of John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch (the \\"Black Comyn\\"), whose son, John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch (the \\"Red Comyn\\") was stabbed to death by Robert the Bruce in the church of Greyfriars in Dumfries in 1306, and this brought the MacDougalls into conflict with the Bruces. The MacDougalls who had supported William Wallace in the cause of Scottish independence now found themselves in a blood feud with the Clan Bruce, whose cause was also of Scottish Independence. Shortly after Robert the Bruce's coronation at Scone he was forced by the English to retreat into Argyll, in an attempt to reach his Clan Campbell allies. However, the Clan MacDougall surprised the Bruce and defeated him in what was known as the Battle of Dalrigh. The king escaped but left behind what was described as a magnificent example of Celtic jewellery, known as the Brooch of Lorne and it became one of the Clan MacDougall's great treasures. Three years later Robert the Bruce led three thousand battle hardened veterans into Argyll against the MacDougalls. John MacDougall of Lorne set an ambush for them but in the ensuing Battle of the Pass of Brander the MacDougalls were defeated and forced to flee. The MacDougalls' lands were then forfeited by the king and he gave them to the Campbells for their loyalty. Although the power of the MacDougalls was never regained, their fortunes were restored somewhat under John MacDougall's grandson, John Gallda MacDougall, Lord of Lorne. In the mid-14th century, the latter relocated from England to Scotland, married a niece of the reigning David II, King of Scotland, and regained the clan's ancestral lands in Lorne.Sellar (2004). Most of their mainland lands were then returned in a royal charter from David II of Scotland. Although the lordship of Lorne eventually passed into the hands of the Stewarts following John Gallda's death, the MacDougall chiefly line preserved through his son Allan. =15th century= A Victorian era, romanticised depiction of a member of the clan by R. R. McIan, from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, published in 1845. In 1468 the Clan MacDougall fought against the Clan Stewart of Appin at the Battle of Stalc. =17th century and Civil War= During the civil war of the 17th century the MacDougalls were generally royalists and chief Alexander MacDougall led five hundred of his clansmen into battle. However, after the defeat of the royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, a Covenanter army, led by David Leslie, Lord Newark was sent into Argyll to deal with royalist supporters. The MacDougalls lands were restored however, after the restoration on the monarchy in 1660. =18th century and Jacobite risings= During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Clan MacDougall supported the Jacobite cause and fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir after which the chief was forced into exile but later returned to Scotland to live as a fugitive. He was pardoned in 1727. His son and next chief, Alexander MacDougall did not take part in the Jacobite rising of 1745. However, his brother and some of the clansmen did indeed fight as Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The fighting force of the clan at this time is given as 200 men.\\"The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans\\". W. & A. K. Johnston Limited. Edinburgh and London. 1886. Page 47. Chief The current chief of the clan is Morag Morley MacDougall of MacDougall and Dunollie. She is a daughter of the sister of the previous clan chief, Coline Helen Elizabeth MacDougall of MacDougall and Dunollie. The latter was in turn a daughter of the previous chief, Alexander James MacDougall of Dunollie.Chiefs (n.d.). The chief of Clan MacDougall represents the senior line of Somerled's descendants.Campbell of Airds (2014) p. 204.

This coat of arms specifically dates to 1931, and is very similar to one inscribed upon an 18th- century tombstone in the chiefs' Kilbride burial ground.Campbell of Airds (1996). Castles Castles built or owned by the Clan MacDougall have included amongst many others: Dunollie Castle, historic seat of the MacDougalls Dunstaffnage Castle, historic seat of the MacDougalls Gylen Castle, a MacDougall property *Dunollie Castle near Oban, Argyll. There are now the remains of a strong but ruinous tower and other buildings that are overgrown. The site has actually been fortified since the days of the kings of D√°l Riata in the sixth and seventh centuries. The present castle was built by the MacDougalls of Lorn. The Brooch of Lorn, which is said to have been captured from Robert the Bruce by the MacDougalls was kept at Dunollie Castle. The castle was attacked by Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell in 1644 and in 1647 it was besieged by a Covenanter army under General David Leslie, in which in the castle was sacked and burnt. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the castle was attacked again when the MacDougalls supported the Stewarts and as a result the lands were forfeited. However, the lands were restored in 1745 and in 1746 the MacDougalls built nearby Dunollie House, although there was an earlier house there dating from about 1600, and the old castle was abandoned. The castle is now in a dangerous condition but is still owned by the MacDougalls. *Dunstaffnage Castle, three and a half miles north-east of Oban, Argyll is a large courtyard castle with a high curtain wall, and later gatehouse range. The kings of D√°l Riata also had a strong hold there. The Stone of Scone (or Stone of Destiny) is also said to have been kept at the castle. The present castle was built by the MacDougalls and was besieged by Robert the Bruce after the MacDougalls were defeated at the Battle of the Pass of Brander in 1309. The Bruce then made it a royal castle with the Campbells as the keepers. There is also a chapel nearby that dates from the thirteenth century. The castle is now in the care of Historic Scotland. *Gylen Castle, on the south coast of Kerrera is a small tower house that was and still is a property of the MacDougalls. An earlier castle on the site was where Alexander II of Scotland may have died during an expedition to recover the Western Isles in the mid- thirteenth century. The current castle was completed by Duncan MacDougall in 1582. It was however torched (along with Dunollie Castle) by the Covenanters under General David Leslie in 1647. *Cairnburgh Castle, on the Treshnish Isles, off the Isle of Mull, is a ruinous castle once held by the MacDougalls that passed to the Crown with the MacDougalls as keepers in 1309. *Dunchonnel Castle, on the Garvellach Isles is a ruinous castle that was once held by the MacDougalls. *Coeffin Castle, on the Isle of Lismore is a ruinous castle once held by the MacDougalls. *Duart Castle, on Mull. The castle was probably built by the MacDougalls in the 13th century, and came into the possession of the MacLeans in the fourteenth century.Roberts (1999) pp. 102-103. *Mingary Castle in Lochaber. The castle may have been built by the MacDougalls in the 13th century.Roberts (1999) p. 103.Addyman; Oram (2012).

It also speaks to optimization of such processes, charging for them as well as estimating future requirements, sometimes called capacity planning. History Over the past several decades (leading up to 2005), organizations (banks, governments, schools, manufacturers and others) have increased their reliance more on \\"Open Systems\\" and less on \\"Closed Systems\\". For example, 25 years ago, a large bank might have most if not all of its critical data housed in an IBM mainframe computer (a \\"Closed System\\"), but today, that same bank might store a substantially greater portion of its critical data in spreadsheets, databases, or even word processing documents (i.e., \\"Open Systems\\"). The problem with Open Systems is, primarily, their unpredictable nature. The very nature of an Open System is that it is exposed to potentially thousands if not millions of variables ranging from network overloads to computer virus attacks to simple software incompatibility. Any one, or indeed several in combination, of these factors may result in either lost data and/or compromised data backup attempts. These types of problems do not generally occur on Closed Systems, or at least, in unpredictable ways. In the \\"old days\\", backups were a nicely contained affair. Today, because of the ubiquity of, and dependence upon, Open Systems, an entire industry has developed around data protection. Three key elements of such data protection are Validation, Optimization and Chargeback. Validation Validation is the process of finding out whether a backup attempt succeeded or not, or, whether the data is backed up enough to consider it \\"protected\\". This process usually involves the examination of log files, the \\"smoking gun\\" often left behind after a backup attempts takes place, as well as media databases, data traffic and even magnetic tapes. Patterns can be detected, key error messages identified and statistics extracted in order to determine which backups worked and which did not. According to Veeam Availability Report in 2014 organizations test their backups for recoverability on average every eight days. However, each quarter, organizations only test an average of 5.26 percent of their backups, meaning that the vast majority of backups are not verified, so could fail and cause downtime. Optimization Optimization is the process of examining productivity patterns in the process of backup to determine where improvements can be made and often, where certain (less important) backup jobs may be eliminated entirely. Chargeback Very often, the service of backing up data is done by one person (or persons) in the service of others, the Owners of the data. Becoming more prevalent today also is the charging for those services back to the data owners.

It was invented by Hugh C. Williams in 1982. It works well if the number N to be factored contains one or more prime factors p such that p + 1 is smooth, i.e. p + 1 contains only small factors. It uses Lucas sequences to perform exponentiation in a quadratic field. It is analogous to Pollard's p ‚àí 1 algorithm. Algorithm Choose some integer A greater than 2 which characterizes the Lucas sequence: :V_0=2, V_1=A, V_j=AV_{j-1}-V_{j-2} where all operations are performed modulo N. Then any odd prime p divides \\\\gcd(N,V_M-2) whenever M is a multiple of p-(D/p), where D=A^2-4 and (D/p) is the Jacobi symbol. We require that (D/p)=-1, that is, D should be a quadratic non-residue modulo p. But as we don't know p beforehand, more than one value of A may be required before finding a solution. If (D/p)=+1, this algorithm degenerates into a slow version of Pollard's p ‚àí 1 algorithm. So, for different values of M we calculate \\\\gcd(N,V_M-2), and when the result is not equal to 1 or to N, we have found a non-trivial factor of N. The values of M used are successive factorials, and V_M is the M-th value of the sequence characterized by V_{M-1}. To find the M-th element V of the sequence characterized by B, we proceed in a manner similar to left-to-right exponentiation: x := B y := (B ^ 2 ‚àí 2) mod N for each bit of M to the right of the most significant bit do if the bit is 1 then x := (x √ó y ‚àí B) mod N y := (y ^ 2 ‚àí 2) mod N else y := (x √ó y ‚àí B) mod N x := (x ^ 2 ‚àí 2) mod N V := x Example With N=112729 and A=5, successive values of V_M are: : V1 of seq(5) = V1! of seq(5) = 5 : V2 of seq(5) = V2! of seq(5) = 23 : V3 of seq(23) = V3! of seq(5) = 12098 : V4 of seq(12098) = V4! of seq(5) = 87680 : V5 of seq(87680) = V5! of seq(5) = 53242 : V6 of seq(53242) = V6! of seq(5) = 27666 : V7 of seq(27666) = V7! of seq(5) = 110229. At this point, gcd(110229-2,112729) = 139, so 139 is a non-trivial factor of 112729. Notice that p+1 = 140 = 22 √ó 5 √ó 7\\\\. The number 7! is the lowest factorial which is multiple of 140, so the proper factor 139 is found in this step. Using another initial value, say A = 9, we get: : V1 of seq(9) = V1! of seq(9) = 9 : V2 of seq(9) = V2! of seq(9) = 79 : V3 of seq(79) = V3! of seq(9) = 41886 : V4 of seq(41886) = V4! of seq(9) = 79378 : V5 of seq(79378) = V5! of seq(9) = 1934 : V6 of seq(1934) = V6! of seq(9) = 10582 : V7 of seq(10582) = V7! of seq(9) = 84241 : V8 of seq(84241) = V8! of seq(9) = 93973 : V9 of seq(93973) = V9! of seq(9) = 91645. At this point gcd(91645-2,112729) = 811, so 811 is a non- trivial factor of 112729. Notice that p‚àí1 = 810 = 2 √ó 5 √ó 34. The number 9! is the lowest factorial which is multiple of 810, so the proper factor 811 is found in this step. The factor 139 is not found this time because p‚àí1 = 138 = 2 √ó 3 √ó 23 which is not a divisor of 9! As can be seen in these examples we do not know in advance whether the prime that will be found has a smooth p+1 or p‚àí1. Generalization Based on Pollard's p ‚àí 1 and Williams's p+1 factoring algorithms, Eric Bach and Jeffrey Shallit developed techniques to factor n efficiently provided that it has a prime factor p such that any kth cyclotomic polynomial Œ¶k(p) is smooth. The first few cyclotomic polynomials are given by the sequence Œ¶1(p) = p‚àí1, Œ¶2(p) = p+1, Œ¶3(p) = p2+p+1, and Œ¶4(p) = p2+1.

Event held in Hong Kong's FCC in June 2006 The company was founded in 1867 as an operator of wharves and warehouses on the south bank of the River Thames.Hays plc International Directory of Company Histories The name can be traced to Alexander Hay, who acquired a brewhouse there in 1651. It was redeveloped as a 'wharf', in fact an enclosed dock, in 1856 and renamed Hay's Wharf. It was rebuilt after the 1861 Tooley Street fire and still stands; it was converted in the 1980s into a shopping and restaurant area known as Hay's Galleria. The Kuwait Investment Authority acquired an indirect 34% holding in the company in 1975, increased to 100% in 1980, chiefly to acquire the property assets on the south bank of the Thames, which were sold to St Martins Property Group in the early 1980s. The former Hay's Wharf, which Hays sold in the early 1980s. It is now called Hay's Galleria. To develop the management team for the services group, the Kuwaitis backed Hays' acquisition of Farmhouse Securities, a food distribution business owned by Ronnie Frost, and Hays then moved into chemical distribution and office support services with Frost and Peter David Thatcher Roberts as CEO.Breaking up the house Ronnie built The Independent, 5 March 2003 In 1986, it purchased a personnel business called Career Care Group, which had been founded by Denis Waxman.Common sense will take you far BBC News, 28 November 2004 Hays was also growing its business storage services which included the brands \\"Hays Wharf\\" and \\"Rentacrate\\". In 1987, a long- planned management buyout was completed, and the company launched an initial public offering in 1989. Ronnie Frost managed the combined services group from 1987 until he retired in 2001. In March 2003, Hays announced that, following a strategic review, it intended to reposition itself purely as a specialist recruitment business and that the company would dispose of all non-core business, including its commercial and logistics operations. Following Hays' change of focus to a recruitment company, Denis Waxman became CEO in July 2004.

It was released for Genesis, Sega CD, Super NES, Master System, DOS, Game Boy, and Game Gear in 1994. The game gives official groups, teams and the fidelity schedule of the championship. The PC and Sega CD versions have digitized stadium photos. The Genesis version carried the PolyGram Video logo across the stadium advertisement boards in the game. This was the last official FIFA World Cup franchise game before Electronic Arts acquired the rights in 1996 for the FIFA Soccer series. Gameplay The game is viewed from a bird's eye-view perspective. Game time may be customised from as short as a minute per half to the full regular 45 minutes. A coin toss is determined by the 'home' team and play will commence. Depending on the options set before the match, the gamer may opt to have less dribble control (resulting in the game ball sliding in the direction of the player movement); manual goalkeeper control which puts the player in control of all goalkeeper saves and kicks; ball-trapping, of which the player will not be able to shield the ball and allows opponents to snatch it away without necessitating a tackle; and no pass-back rule which was implemented during World Cup '94 where a keeper may not pick up the ball whenever an outfield player passes it back to him. If the gamer opts for manual goalkeeper control, the player would have to make a save by guessing where the opponent will place the ball and jumping into the general direction with any of the console buttons and the directional keys if applicable. Similarly, outfield players have the option to either pass the ball, kick it (when attempting to score a goal) or attempt a lob. Freekicks may also be executed using any of the above. However, a penalty kick is done in a different game screen similar to that of World Cup 98 (video game) and where a hovering indicator swings from side to side to indicate the direction of the shot. Basic tactics (or preset tactics) can also be customised prior to the game and may be changed in-game. Team rosters, while not based on real-life players, have variable attributes amongst its players and divided into three major skills which are speed, dribble control and shooting accuracy. Goalkeepers do not have a separate skill evaluation method and can be picked from normal players. Playable Teams Qualified teams: Teams that did not qualify:   Reception GamePro praised the SNES version's controls, sound effects, and \\"amazing range of options\\", though they criticized the graphics.

Histories written down in the early colonial period portray Tezozomoc as a military and political genius who oversaw an expansion of Tepanec influence, bringing about Azcapotzalco's dominance in the Valley of Mexico and beyond.  Biography  Tezozomoc was a son of Acolnahuacatzin and Cuetlaxochitzin. He is described by Fernando de Alva Cort√©s Ixtlilxochitl as a tyrant and: \\"the most cruel man who ever lived, proud, warlike and domineering. And he was so old, according to what appears in the histories, and to what elderly princes have told me, that they carried him about like a child swathed in feathers and soft skins; they always took him out into the sun to warm him up, and at night he slept between two great braziers, and he never withdrew from their glow because he lacked natural heat. And he was very temperate in his eating and drinking and for this reason he lived so long.\\" He approved the choice of King Huitzilihuitl in 1403 and gave him his daughter Ayauhcihuatl in marriage, notwithstanding the opposition of his son Maxtla. He declared war against the king of Texcoco, Techotlalatzin, and being defeated sued for peace; but after the latter's death he continued the war against his successor, Ixtlilxochitl I, whom he defeated and assassinated in 1419, usurping the crown of Texcoco. Upon Tezozomoc's death in the year Twelve Rabbit (1426), his son Tayatzin became a king, but Maxtla seized power at Azcapotzalco, leaving the rulership of Coyoac√°n to his son Tecollotzin.Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 128‚Äì129, 230‚Äì231.

Before the conquest, this territory contained a number of competing Mesoamerican kingdoms, the majority of which were Maya. Many conquistadors viewed the Maya as \\"infidels\\" who needed to be forcefully converted and pacified, disregarding the achievements of their civilization.Jones 2000, p. 356. The first contact between the Maya and European explorers came in the early 16th century when a Spanish ship sailing from Panama to Santo Domingo was wrecked on the east coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula in 1511. Several Spanish expeditions followed in 1517 and 1519, making landfall on various parts of the Yucat√°n coast.Jones 2000, pp. 356‚Äì358. The Spanish conquest of the Maya was a prolonged affair; the Maya kingdoms resisted integration into the Spanish Empire with such tenacity that their defeat took almost two centuries.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 8, 757. Pedro de Alvarado arrived in Guatemala from the newly conquered Mexico in early 1524, commanding a mixed force of Spanish conquistadors and native allies, mostly from Tlaxcala and Cholula. Geographic features across Guatemala now bear Nahuatl placenames owing to the influence of these Mexican allies, who translated for the Spanish. The Kaqchikel Maya initially allied themselves with the Spanish, but soon rebelled against excessive demands for tribute and did not finally surrender until 1530. In the meantime the other major highland Maya kingdoms had each been defeated in turn by the Spanish and allied warriors from Mexico and already subjugated Maya kingdoms in Guatemala. The Itza Maya and other lowland groups in the Pet√©n Basin were first contacted by Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1525, but remained independent and hostile to the encroaching Spanish until 1697, when a concerted Spanish assault led by Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a y Arizmendi finally defeated the last independent Maya kingdom. Spanish and native tactics and technology differed greatly. The Spanish viewed the taking of prisoners as a hindrance to outright victory, whereas the Maya prioritised the capture of live prisoners and of booty. The indigenous peoples of Guatemala lacked key elements of Old World technology such as a functional wheel, horses, iron, steel, and gunpowder; they were also extremely susceptible to Old World diseases, against which they had no resistance. The Maya preferred raiding and ambush to large-scale warfare, using spears, arrows and wooden swords with inset obsidian blades; the Xinca of the southern coastal plain used poison on their arrows. In response to the use of Spanish cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits and lining them with wooden stakes. Historical sources A page from the alt=Painting with three prominent indigenous warriors in single file facing left, wearing cloaks and grasping staves, followed by a dog. Below them and to the right is the smaller image of a mounted Spaniard with a raised lance. To the left and indigenous porter carries a pack fixed by a strap across his forehead, and sports a staff in one hand. All are apparently moving towards a doorway at top left. The sources describing the Spanish conquest of Guatemala include those written by the Spanish themselves, among them two of four letters written by conquistador Pedro de Alvarado to Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1524, describing the initial campaign to subjugate the Guatemalan Highlands. These letters were despatched to Tenochtitlan, addressed to Cort√©s but with a royal audience in mind; two of these letters are now lost.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 23. Gonzalo de Alvarado y Ch√°vez was Pedro de Alvarado's cousin; he accompanied him on his first campaign in Guatemala and in 1525 he became the chief constable of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, the newly founded Spanish capital. Gonzalo wrote an account that mostly supports that of Pedro de Alvarado. Pedro de Alvarado's brother Jorge wrote another account to the king of Spain that explained it was his own campaign of 1527‚Äì1529 that established the Spanish colony.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 49. Bernal D√≠az del Castillo wrote a lengthy account of the conquest of Mexico and neighbouring regions, the Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a (\\"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\\"); his account of the conquest of Guatemala generally agrees with that of the Alvarados.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 49‚Äì50. His account was finished around 1568, some 40 years after the campaigns it describes.D√≠az del Castillo 1632, 2005, p. 5. Hern√°n Cort√©s described his expedition to Honduras in the fifth letter of his Cartas de Relaci√≥n,Cort√©s 1844, 2005, p. xxi. in which he details his crossing of what is now Guatemala's Pet√©n Department. Dominican friar Bartolom√© de las Casas wrote a highly critical account of the Spanish conquest of the Americas and included accounts of some incidents in Guatemala.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 50. The Brev√≠sima Relaci√≥n de la Destrucci√≥n de las Indias (\\"Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies\\") was first published in 1552 in Seville.de Las Casas 1552, 1997, p. 13. The Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish who accompanied them in their invasion of Guatemala wrote their own accounts of the conquest; these included a letter to the Spanish king protesting at their poor treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 79‚Äì81. Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, which was probably painted in Ciudad Vieja in the 1530s, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala, painted in Tlaxcala.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 94. Accounts of the conquest as seen from the point of view of the defeated highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels, which includes the Xajil Chronicle describing the history of the Kaqchikel from their mythical creation down through the Spanish conquest and continuing to 1619.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 103‚Äì104.

Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm√°n was a colonial Guatemalan historian of Spanish descent who wrote La Recordaci√≥n Florida, also called Historia de Guatemala (History of Guatemala). The book was written in 1690 and is regarded as one of the most important works of Guatemalan history, and is the first such book to have been written by a criollo author.Lara Figueroa 2000, p. 1. Field investigation has tended to support the estimates of indigenous population and army sizes given by Fuentes y Guzm√°n.Lovell 2005, p. 69. Background Spanish expansion routes in the Caribbean during the early 16th century Christopher Columbus discovered the New World for the Kingdom of Castile and Leon in 1492. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule.Feldman 2000, p. xix. In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hern√°n Cort√©s set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast.Smith 1996, 2003, p. 272. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish.Smith 1996, 2003, p. 276. A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas.Smith 1996, 2003, p. 279. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the king of Spain via the Council of the Indies.Coe and Koontz 2002, p. 229. Hern√°n Cort√©s received reports of rich, populated lands to the south and dispatched Pedro de Alvarado to investigate the region.Lovell 2005, p. 58. =Preparations= In the run up to the announcement that an invasion force was to be sent to Guatemala, 10,000 Nahua warriors had already been assembled by the Aztec emperor Cuauht√©moc to accompany the Spanish expedition. Warriors were ordered to be gathered from each of the Mexica and Tlaxcaltec towns. The native warriors supplied their own weapons, including swords, clubs and bows and arrows.Matthew 2012, p. 78. Alvarado's army left Tenochtitlan at the beginning of the dry season, sometime between the second half of November and December 1523. As Alvarado left the Aztec capital, he led about 400 Spanish and approximately 200 Tlaxcaltec and Cholultec warriors and 100 Mexica, meeting up with the gathered reinforcements on the way. When the army left the Basin of Mexico, it may have included as many as 20,000 native warriors from various kingdoms although the exact numbers are disputed.Matthew 2012, p. 79. By the time the army crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the massed native warriors included 800 from Tlaxcala, 400 from Huejotzingo, 1600 from Tepeaca plus many more from other former Aztec territories. Further Mesoamerican warriors were recruited from the Zapotec and Mixtec provinces, with the addition of more Nahuas from the Aztec garrison in Soconusco.Matthew 2012, p. 80. Guatemala before the conquest alt=Guatemala is situated between the Pacific Ocean to the south and the Caribbean Sea to the northeast. The broad band of the Sierra Madre mountains sweeps down from Mexico in the west, across southern and central Guatemala and into El Salvador and Honduras to the east. The north is dominated by a broad lowland plain that extends eastwards into Belize and north into Mexico. A narrower plain separates the Sierra Madre from the Pacific Ocean to the south. In the early 16th century the territory that now makes up Guatemala was divided into various competing polities, each locked in continual struggle with its neighbours.Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 14. The most important were the K ºiche º, the Kaqchikel, the Tz ºutujil, the Chajoma,Hill 1998, pp. 229, 233. the Mam, the Poqomam and the Pipil.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 6. All were Maya groups except for the Pipil, who were a Nahua group related to the Aztecs; the Pipil had a number of small city-states along the Pacific coastal plain of southern Guatemala and El Salvador.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 25. The Pipil of Guatemala had their capital at Itzcuintepec.Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 123. The Xinca were another non-Maya group occupying the southeastern Pacific coastal area.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 26. Jim√©nez 2006, p. 1. n. 1. The Maya had never been unified as a single empire, but by the time the Spanish arrived Maya civilization was thousands of years old and had already seen the rise and fall of great cities.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 4. On the eve of the conquest the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 717. In the centuries preceding the arrival of the Spanish the K ºiche º had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K ºiche º allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast with Iximche as its capital. In the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K ºiche º.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 5. Other highland groups included the Tz ºutujil around Lake Atitl√°n, the Mam in the western highlands and the Poqomam in the eastern highlands. The kingdom of the Itza was the most powerful polity in the Pet√©n lowlands of northern Guatemala,Rice 2009, p. 17. centred on their capital Nojpet√©n, on an island in Lake Pet√©n Itz√°.While most sources accept the modern town of Flores on Lake Pet√©n Itz√° as the location of Nojpet√©n/Tayasal, Arlen Chase argued that this identification is incorrect and that descriptions of Nojpet√©n correspond better to the archaeological site of Topoxte on Lake Yaxha. Chase 1976. See also the detailed rebuttal by Jones, Rice and Rice 1981. The second polity in importance was that of their hostile neighbours, the Kowoj. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpet√©n, Lake Macanch√©, Lake Yaxh√° and Lake Sacnab.Rice and Rice 2009, pp. 10‚Äì11. Rice 2009, p. 17. Other groups are less well known and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the Lakandon Ch ºol, the Mopan, the Manche Ch ºol and the Yalain.Rice 2009, p. 17. Feldman 2000, p. xxi. The Kejache occupied an area north of the lake on the route to Campeche, while the Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Pet√©n.Rice 2009, p. 19. The Manche territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.Feldman 2000, p. xxi. The Yalain had their territory immediately to the east of Lake Pet√©n Itz√°.Rice and Rice 2009, pp. 8, 11‚Äì12. =Native weapons and tactics= Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.Phillips 2006, 2007, p. 95. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Pet√©n Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian,Rice et al. 2009, p. 129. similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Xinca of the Pacific coast attacked the Spanish with spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans.Phillips 2006, 2007, p. 94. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 73, 108. Conquistadors alt=Pedro de Alvarado entered Guatemala from the west along the southern Pacific plain in 1524, before swinging northwards and fighting a number of battles to enter the highlands. He then executed a broad loop around the north side of the highland Lake Atitl√°n, fighting further battles along the way, before descending southwards once more into the Pacific lowlands. Two more battles were fought as his forces headed east into what is now El Salvador. In 1525 Hern√°n Cort√©s entered northern Guatemala from the north, crossed to Lake Pet√©n Itz√° and continued roughly southeast to Lake Izabal before turning east to the Gulf of Honduras. The conquistadors were all volunteers, the majority of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead a portion of the spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour.Polo Sifontes 1986, pp. 57‚Äì58. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe.Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 62. The initial incursion into Guatemala was led by Pedro de Alvarado, who earned the military title of Adelantado in 1527;Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 61. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 124. he answered to the Spanish crown via Hern√°n Cort√©s in Mexico. Other early conquistadors included Pedro de Alvarado's brothers G√≥mez de Alvarado, Jorge de Alvarado and Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras; and his cousins Gonzalo de Alvarado y Ch√°vez, Hernando de Alvarado and Diego de Alvarado. Pedro de Portocarrero was a nobleman who joined the initial invasion.Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 61. Bernal D√≠az del Castillo was a petty nobleman who accompanied Hern√°n Cort√©s when he crossed the northern lowlands, and Pedro de Alvarado on his invasion of the highlands.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761. D√≠az del Castillo 1632, 2005, p. 10. Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 8. In addition to Spaniards, the invasion force probably included dozens of armed African slaves and freemen.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 8. =Spanish weapons and tactics= Spanish weaponry and tactics differed greatly from that of the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets and cannon),Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 15, 61. war dogs and war horses. Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority, while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory.Drew 1999, p. 382. The inhabitants of Guatemala, for all their sophistication, lacked key elements of Old World technology, such as the use of iron and steel and functional wheels.Webster 2002, p. 77. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 15. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.Lovell 1988, p. 29. In Guatemala the Spanish routinely fielded indigenous allies; at first these were Nahua brought from the recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard on the field of battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 16. In at least one case, encomienda rights were granted to one of the Tlaxcalan leaders who came as allies, and land grants and exemption from being given in encomienda were given to the Mexican allies as rewards for their participation in the conquest.Matthew 2012, p. 111. In practice, such privileges were easily removed or sidestepped by the Spanish and the indigenous conquistadors were treated in a similar manner to the conquered natives.Matthew 2012, pp. 113, 117. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as mountains and forests. Impact of Old World diseases Epidemics accidentally introduced by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had a major impact on Maya populations.Jones 2000, p. 363. The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; the diseases crippled armies and decimated populations before battles were even fought.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 762‚Äì763. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact. In 1519 and 1520, before the arrival of the Spanish in the region, a number of epidemics swept through southern Guatemala.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 3. At the same time as the Spanish were occupied with the overthrow of the Aztec empire, a devastating plague struck the Kaqchikel capital of Iximche, and the city of Q ºumarkaj, capital of the K ºiche º, may also have suffered from the same epidemic.Carmack 2001b, p. 172. It is likely that the same combination of smallpox and a pulmonary plague swept across the entire Guatemalan Highlands.Lovell 2005, p. 70. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33‚Äì50% of the population of the highlands perished. Population levels in the Guatemalan Highlands did not recover to their pre-conquest levels until the middle of the 20th century.Lovell 2005, p. 71. In 1666 pestilence or murine typhus swept through what is now the department of Huehuetenango. Smallpox was reported in San Pedro Saloma, in 1795.Hinz 2008, 2010, p. 37. At the time of the fall of Nojpet√©n in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.Jones 2000, p. 364.

The Kaqchikel kingdom was centred on Iximche, located roughly halfway between Lake Atitl√°n to the west and modern Guatemala City to the east. The Tz ºutujil kingdom was based around the south shore of the lake, extending into the Pacific lowlands. The Pipil were situated further east along the Pacific plain and the Pocomam occupied the highlands to the east of modern Guatemala City. The K ºiche º kingdom extended to the north and west of the lake with principal settlements at Xelaju, Totonicapan, Q ºumarkaj, Pismachi º and Jakawitz. The Mam kingdom covered the western highlands bordering modern Mexico. The conquest of the highlands was made difficult by the many independent polities in the region, rather than one powerful enemy to be defeated as was the case in central Mexico.Lovell 2005, pp. 59‚Äì60. After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hern√°n Cort√©s to declare their allegiance to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K ºiche º Maya of Q ºumarkaj may also have sent a delegation.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. In 1522 Cort√©s sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q ºumarkaj at Tuxp√°n;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 3. both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the king of Spain. But Cort√©s' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K ºiche º and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were instead harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cort√©s decided to despatch Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, crossbows, muskets, 4 cannons, large amounts of ammunition and gunpowder, and thousands of allied Mexican warriors from Tlaxcala, Cholula and other cities in central Mexico;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Lovell 2005, p. 58. Matthew 2012, pp. 78‚Äì79. they arrived in Soconusco in 1523. Pedro de Alvarado was infamous for the massacre of Aztec nobles in Tenochtitlan and, according to Bartolom√© de las Casas, he committed further atrocities in the conquest of the Maya kingdoms in Guatemala.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 763‚Äì764. Some groups remained loyal to the Spanish once they had submitted to the conquest, such as the Tz ºutujil and the K ºiche º of Quetzaltenango, and provided them with warriors to assist further conquest. Other groups soon rebelled however, and by 1526 numerous rebellions had engulfed the highlands.Carmack 2001a, pp. 39‚Äì40. =Subjugation of the K ºiche º= Pedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the Pacific coast unopposed until they reached the Samal√° River in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the K ºiche º kingdom, and a K ºiche º army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements in an effort to terrorise the K ºiche º.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764. On 8 February 1524 Alvarado's army fought a battle at Xetulul, called Zapotitl√°n by his Mexican allies (modern San Francisco Zapotitl√°n). Although suffering many injuries inflicted by defending K ºiche º archers, the Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 65. Gall 1967, pp. 40‚Äì41. Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the K ºiche º heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K ºiche º warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the K ºiche º, who had never before seen horses. The cavalry scattered the K ºiche º and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) only to find it deserted.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764. Gall 1967, p. 41. Although the common view is that the K ºiche º prince Tecun Uman died in the later battle near Olintepeque, the Spanish accounts are clear that at least one and possibly two of the lords of Q ºumarkaj died in the fierce battles upon the initial approach to Quetzaltenango.Gall 1967, pp. 41‚Äì42. D√≠az del Castillo 1632, 2005, p. 510. The death of Tecun Uman is said to have taken place in the battle of El Pinar,Restall and Asselbergs 2007, pp. 9, 30. and local tradition has his death taking place on the Llanos de Urbina (Plains of Urbina), upon the approach to Quetzaltenango near the modern village of Cantel.Cornejo Sam 2009, pp. 269‚Äì270. Pedro de Alvarado, in his third letter to Hern√°n Cort√©s, describes the death of one of the four lords of Q ºumarkaj upon the approach to Quetzaltenango. The letter was dated 11 April 1524 and was written during his stay at Q ºumarkaj. Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524,Gall 1967, p. 41. a K ºiche º army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and were comprehensively defeated; many K ºiche º nobles were among the dead. Such were the numbers of K ºiche º dead that Olintepeque was given the name Xequiquel, roughly meaning \\"bathed in blood\\".Fuentes y Guzm√°n 1882, p. 49. In the early 17th century, the grandson of the K ºiche º king informed the alcalde mayor (the highest colonial official at the time) that the K ºiche º army that had marched out of Q ºumarkaj to confront the invaders numbered 30,000 warriors, a claim that is considered credible by modern scholars.Veblen 1977, p. 488. This battle exhausted the K ºiche º militarily and they asked for peace and offered tribute, inviting Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Q ºumarkaj, which was known as Tecpan Utatlan to the Nahuatl-speaking allies of the Spanish. Alvarado was deeply suspicious of the K ºiche º intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q ºumarkaj with his army.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 765. The day after the battle of Olintepeque, the Spanish army arrived at Tzakah√°, which submitted peacefully. There the Spanish chaplains Juan Godinez and Juan D√≠az conducted a Roman Catholic mass under a makeshift roof;de Le√≥n Soto 2010, p. 24. this site was chosen to build the first church in Guatemala,de Le√≥n Soto 2010, p. 22. which was dedicated to Concepci√≥n La Conquistadora. Tzakah√° was renamed as San Luis Salcaj√°. The first Easter mass held in Guatemala was celebrated in the new church, during which high-ranking natives were baptised. alt=Grass- and scrub-covered ruins set against a backdrop of low pine forest. A crumbling squat square tower stands behind to the right, all that remains of the Temple of Tohil, with the remains of the walls of the ballcourt to the left in the foreground. In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado entered Q ºumarkaj at the invitation of the remaining lords of the K ºiche º after their catastrophic defeat,Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764‚Äì765. Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 68, 74. fearing that he was entering a trap.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 764‚Äì765. He encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 74. Fearing the great number of K ºiche º warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q ºumarkaj, he invited the leading lords of the city, Oxib-Keh (the ajpop, or king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the ajpop k ºamha, or king elect) to visit him in his camp.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 75. Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764‚Äì765. As soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp. The K ºiche º warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 75. At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K ºiche º lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city.Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 74‚Äì75. Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764‚Äì765. After the destruction of Q ºumarkaj and the execution of its rulers, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K ºiche º resistance. Alvarado wrote that they sent 4000 warriors to assist him, although the Kaqchikel recorded that they sent only 400. =San Marcos: Province of Tecusitl√°n and Lacand√≥n= With the capitulation of the K ºiche º kingdom, various non-K ºiche º peoples under K ºiche º dominion also submitted to the Spanish. This included the Mam inhabitants of the area now within the modern department of San Marcos. Quetzaltenango and San Marcos were placed under the command of Juan de Le√≥n y Cardona, who began the reduction of indigenous populations and the foundation of Spanish towns. The towns of San Marcos and San Pedro Sacatep√©quez were founded soon after the conquest of western Guatemala.Calder√≥n Cruz 1994, p. 23. de Le√≥n Soto 2010, p. 24. In 1533 Pedro de Alvarado ordered de Le√≥n y Cardona to explore and conquer the area around the Tacan√°, Tajumulco, Lacand√≥n and San Antonio volcanoes; in colonial times this area was referred to as the Province of Tecusitl√°n and Lacand√≥n. De Le√≥n marched to a Maya city named Quezalli by his Nahuatl-speaking allies with a force of fifty Spaniards; his Mexican allies also referred to the city by the name Sacatepequez. De Le√≥n renamed the city as San Pedro Sacatep√©quez in honour of his friar, Pedro de Angulo.de Le√≥n Soto 2010, p. 26. The Spanish founded a village nearby at Candacuchex in April that year, renaming it as San Marcos.de Le√≥n Soto 2010, pp. 24‚Äì25. =Kaqchikel alliance= On 14 April 1524, soon after the defeat of the K ºiche º, the Spanish were invited into Iximche and were well received by the lords Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 297. Guillem√≠n 1965, p. 9.Recinos places all these dates two days earlier (e.g. the Spanish arrival at Iximche on 12 April rather than 14 April) based on vague dating in Spanish primary records. Schele and Fahsen calculated all dates on the more securely dated Kaqchikel annals, where equivalent dates are often given in both the Kaqchikel and Spanish calendars. The Schele and Fahsen dates are used in this section. Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 386. n. 15. The Kaqchikel kings provided native soldiers to assist the conquistadors against continuing K ºiche º resistance and to help with the defeat of the neighbouring Tz ºutuhil kingdom.Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 297. The Spanish only stayed briefly in Iximche before continuing through Atitl√°n, Escuintla and Cuscatl√°n. The Spanish returned to the Kaqchikel capital on 23 July 1524 and on 27 July (1 Q ºat in the Kaqchikel calendar) Pedro de Alvarado declared Iximche as the first capital of Guatemala, Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (\\"St. James of the Knights of Guatemala\\").Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 297. Recinos 1998, p. 101. Guillem√≠n 1965, p. 10. Iximche was called Guatemala by the Spanish, from the Nahuatl Quauhtemallan meaning \\"forested land\\". Since the Spanish conquistadors founded their first capital at Iximche, they took the name of the city used by their Nahuatl-speaking Mexican allies and applied it to the new Spanish city and, by extension, to the kingdom. From this comes the modern name of the country.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 292. When Pedro de Alvarado moved his army to Iximche, he left the defeated K ºiche º kingdom under the command of Juan de Le√≥n y Cardona.de Le√≥n Soto 2010, p. 29. Although de Le√≥n y Cardona was given command of the western reaches of the new colony, he continued to take an active role in the continuing conquest, including the later assault on the Poqomam capital.de Le√≥n Soto 2010, pp. 22, 25. =Conquest of the Tz ºutujil= alt=View across hills to a broad lake bathed in a light mist. The mountainous lake shore curves from the left foreground backwards and to the right, with several volcanoes rising from the far shore, framed by a clear blue sky above. The Kaqchikel appear to have entered into an alliance with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz ºutujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan. Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan at the request of the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz ºutujil.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 765. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 82. When news of the killing of the messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz ºutujil with their Kaqchikel allies. Pedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's hard march, without encountering any opposition. Seeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore. Opposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz ºutujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz ºutujil fled.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 82. The causeway was too narrow for the horses, therefore the conquistadors dismounted and crossed to the island before the inhabitants could break the bridges.Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 82‚Äì83. The rest of Alvarado's army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island. The surviving Tz ºutujil fled into the lake and swam to safety on another island. The Spanish could not pursue the survivors further because 300 canoes sent by the Kaqchikels had not yet arrived. This battle took place on 18 April.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 83. The following day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in the centre of the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to catch some locals and used them to send messages to the Tz ºutujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz ºutujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche. Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz ºutujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 765‚Äì766. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 84. A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain, although Alvarado did not name them in his letters; they confirmed Kaqchikel reports that further out on the Pacific plain was the kingdom called Izcuintepeque in Nahuatl, or Panatacat in Kaqchikel, whose inhabitants were warlike and hostile towards their neighbours.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 84. =Kaqchikel rebellion= Pedro de Alvarado rapidly began to demand gold in tribute from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 298. He demanded that their kings deliver 1000 gold leaves, each worth 15 pesos.Guillemin 1967 p. 25.A peso was a Spanish coin. One peso was worth eight reales (the source of the term \\"pieces of eight\\") or two tostones. During the conquest, a peso contained of gold. Lovell 2005, p. 223. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 52. n. 25. A Kaqchikel priest foretold that the Kaqchikel gods would destroy the Spanish, causing the Kaqchikel people to abandon their city and flee to the forests and hills on 28 August 1524 (7 Ahmak in the Kaqchikel calendar). Ten days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel. Two years later, on 9 February 1526, a group of sixteen Spanish deserters burnt the palace of the Ahpo Xahil, sacked the temples and kidnapped a priest, acts that the Kaqchikel blamed on Pedro de Alvarado.Schele & Mathews 1999, pp. 298, 310, 386 n19.Recinos 1998, p. 19. gives sixty deserters. Conquistador Bernal D√≠az del Castillo recounted how in 1526 he returned to Iximche and spent the night in the \\"old city of Guatemala\\" together with Luis Mar√≠n and other members of Hern√°n Cort√©s's expedition to Honduras. He reported that the houses of the city were still in excellent condition; his account was the last description of the city while it was still inhabitable.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 298. Recinos 1998, p. 19. The Spanish founded a new town at nearby Tecp√°n Guatemala; Tecp√°n is Nahuatl for \\"palace\\", thus the name of the new town translated as \\"the palace among the trees\\". The Spanish abandoned Tecp√°n in 1527, because of the continuous Kaqchikel attacks, and moved to the Almolonga Valley to the east, refounding their capital on the site of today's San Miguel Escobar district of Ciudad Vieja, near Antigua Guatemala.Lutz 1997, pp. 10, 258. Ortiz Flores 2008. The Nahua and Oaxacan allies of the Spanish settled in what is now central Ciudad Vieja, then known as Almolonga (not to be confused with Almolonga near Quetzaltenango);Matthews 2012, p. 87. Zapotec and Mixtec allies also settled San Gaspar Vivar about northeast of Almolonga, which they founded in 1530.Matthews 2012, p. 57. The Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years, but on 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops,Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 92. the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja. The former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecp√°n, the rest to Solol√° and other towns around Lake Atitl√°n.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 299. =Siege of Zaculeu= alt=A cluster of squat white step pyramids, the tallest of them topped by a shrine with three doorways. In the background is a low mountain ridge. Although a state of hostilities existed between the Mam and the K ºiche º of Q ºumarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel against their former K ºiche º allies prior to European contact, when the conquistadors arrived there was a shift in the political landscape. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Mam king Kayb ºil B ºalam was received with great honour in Q ºumarkaj while he was there.del √Åguila Flores 2007, p. 37. The expedition against Zaculeu was apparently initiated after K ºiche º bitterness at their failure to contain the Spanish at Q ºumarkaj, with the plan to trap the conquistadors in the city having been suggested to them by the Mam king, Kayb ºil B ºalam; the resulting execution of the K ºiche º kings was viewed as unjust. The K ºiche º suggestion of marching on the Mam was quickly taken up by the Spanish.Lovell 2005, p. 60. At the time of the conquest, the main Mam population was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled Chinabjul), now the city of Huehuetenango, but Zaculeu's fortifications led to its use as a refuge during the conquest.Recinos 1986, p. 110. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado,Gall 1967, p. 39. in 1525, with 40 Spanish cavalry and 80 Spanish infantry,Lovell 2005, p. 61. and some 2,000 Mexican and K ºiche º allies.Carmack 2001a, p. 39. Gonzalo de Alvarado left the Spanish camp at Tecp√°n Guatemala in July 1525 and marched to the town of Totonicap√°n, which he used as a supply base. From Totonicap√°n the expedition headed north to Momostenango, although it was delayed by heavy rains. Momostenango quickly fell to the Spanish after a four-hour battle. The following day Gonzalo de Alvarado marched on Huehuetenango and was confronted by a Mam army of 5,000 warriors from nearby Malacat√°n (modern Malacatancito). The Mam army advanced across the plain in battle formation and was met by a Spanish cavalry charge that threw them into disarray, with the infantry mopping up those Mam that survived the cavalry. Gonzalo de Alvarado slew the Mam leader Canil Acab with his lance, at which point the Mam army's resistance was broken, and the surviving warriors fled to the hills. Alvarado entered Malacat√°n unopposed to find it occupied only by the sick and the elderly. Messengers from the community's leaders arrived from the hills and offered their unconditional surrender, which was accepted by Alvarado. The Spanish army rested for a few days, then continued onwards to Huehuetenango only to find it deserted. Kayb ºil B ºalam had received news of the Spanish advance and had withdrawn to his fortress at Zaculeu. Alvarado sent a message to Zaculeu proposing terms for the peaceful surrender of the Mam king, who chose not to answer.Lovell 2005, pp. 61‚Äì62. Zaculeu was defended by Kayb ºil B ºalam commanding some 6,000 warriors gathered from Huehuetenango, Zaculeu, Cuilco and Ixtahuac√°n. The fortress was surrounded on three sides by deep ravines and defended by a formidable system of walls and ditches. Gonzalo de Alvarado, although outnumbered two to one, decided to launch an assault on the weaker northern entrance. Mam warriors initially held the northern approaches against the Spanish infantry but fell back before repeated cavalry charges. The Mam defence was reinforced by an estimated 2,000 warriors from within Zaculeu but was unable to push the Spanish back. Kayb ºil B ºalam, seeing that outright victory on an open battlefield was impossible, withdrew his army back within the safety of the walls. As Alvarado dug in and laid siege to the fortress, an army of approximately 8,000 Mam warriors descended on Zaculeu from the Cuchumatanes mountains to the north, drawn from those towns allied with the city.Lovell 2005, p. 62. Alvarado left Antonio de Salazar to supervise the siege and marched north to confront the Mam army.Lovell 2005, pp. 62, 64. The Mam army was disorganised, and although it was a match for the Spanish and allied foot soldiers, it was vulnerable to the repeated charges of the experienced Spanish cavalry. The relief army was broken and annihilated, allowing Alvarado to return to reinforce the siege.Lovell 2005, p. 64. After several months the Mam were reduced to starvation. Kayb ºil B ºalam finally surrendered the city to the Spanish in the middle of October 1525.Recinos 1986, p. 110. del √Åguila Flores 2007, p. 38. Lovell 2005, p. 64. When the Spanish entered the city they found 1,800 dead Indians, and the survivors eating the corpses of the dead. After the fall of Zaculeu, a Spanish garrison was established at Huehuetenango under the command of Gonzalo de Sol√≠s; Gonzalo de Alvarado returned to Tecp√°n Guatemala to report his victory to his brother. =Conquest of the Poqomam= In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a small company to conquer Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), the capital of the Poqomam.The location of the historical city of Mixco Viejo has been the source of some confusion. The archaeological site now known as Mixco Viejo has been proven to be Jilotepeque Viejo, the capital of the Chajoma. The Mixco Viejo of colonial records has now been associated with the archaeological site of Chinautla Viejo, much closer to modern Mixco. Carmack 2001a, pp. 151, 158. At the Spanish approach, the inhabitants remained enclosed in the fortified city. The Spanish attempted an approach from the west through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, possibly from Chinautla, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted for most of the day but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry, forcing the Poqomam reinforcements to withdraw.Lehmann 1968, pp. 11‚Äì13. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance in the form of a cave leading up from a nearby river, allowing the inhabitants to come and go.Lehmann 1968, pp. 11‚Äì13. Recinos, Adrian 1952, 1986, p. 108. Armed with the knowledge gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish to break through the pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco. =Resettlement of the Chajoma= There are no direct sources describing the conquest of the Chajoma by the Spanish but it appears to have been a drawn-out campaign rather than a rapid victory.Hill 1998, pp. 253. The only description of the conquest of the Chajoma is a secondary account appearing in the work of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm√°n in the 17th century, long after the event.Hill 1996, p. 85. After the conquest, the inhabitants of the eastern part of the kingdom were relocated by the conquerors to San Pedro Sacatep√©quez, including some of the inhabitants of the archaeological site now known as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo). The rest of the population of Mixco Viejo, together with the inhabitants of the western part of the kingdom, were moved to San Mart√≠n Jilotepeque. The Chajoma rebelled against the Spanish in 1526, fighting a battle at Ukub ºil, an unidentified site somewhere near the modern towns of San Juan Sacatep√©quez and San Pedro Sacatep√©quez.Carmack 2001a, pp. 155‚Äì156.The rebellion and the Spanish response, led by Pedro de Portocarrero, is described in Part One Book 13 Chapter IV of the Recordaci√≥n Florida. In the colonial period, most of the surviving Chajoma were forcibly settled in the towns of San Juan Sacatep√©quez, San Pedro Sacatep√©quez and San Mart√≠n Jilotepeque as a result of the Spanish policy of congregaciones; the people were moved to whichever of the three towns was closest to their pre-conquest land holdings. Some Iximche Kaqchikels seem also to have been relocated to the same towns.Hill 1996, pp. 65, 67. After their relocation some of the Chajoma drifted back to their pre-conquest centres, creating informal settlements and provoking hostilities with the Poqomam of Mixco and Chinautla along the former border between the pre- Columbian kingdoms. Some of these settlements eventually received official recognition, such as San Raimundo near Sacul. =El Progreso and Zacapa= The Spanish colonial corregimiento of San Crist√≥bal Acasaguastl√°n was established in 1551 with its seat in the town of that name, now in the eastern portion of the modern department of El Progreso. Acasaguastl√°n was one of few pre- conquest centres of population in the middle Motagua River drainage, due to the arid climate.Feldman 1998, p. 29. It covered a broad area that included Cubulco, Rabinal, and Salam√° (all in Baja Verapaz), San Agust√≠n de la Real Corona (modern San Agust√≠n Acasaguastl√°n) and La Magdalena in El Progreso, and Chimalapa, Gual√°n, Usumatl√°n and Zacapa, all in the department of Zacapa. Chimalapa, Gual√°n and Usumatl√°n were all satellite settlements of Acasaguastl√°n. San Crist√≥bal Acasaguastl√°n and the surrounding area were reduced into colonial settlements by friars of the Dominican Order; at the time of the conquest the area was inhabited by Poqomchi º Maya and by the Nahuatl-speaking Pipil.Municipalidad de San Crist√≥bal Acasaguastl√°n 2011. In the 1520s, immediately after conquest, the inhabitants paid taxes to the Spanish Crown in the form of cacao, textiles, gold, silver and slaves. Within a few decades taxes were instead paid in beans, cotton and maize. Acasaguastl√°n was first given in encomienda to conquistador Diego Salvatierra in 1526.Feldman 1998, pp. 29‚Äì30. =Chiquimula= Chiquimula de la Sierra (\\"Chiquimula in the Highlands\\"), occupying the area of the modern department of Chiquimula to the east of the Poqomam and Chajoma, was inhabited by Ch ºorti º Maya at the time of the conquest.Castro Ramos 2003, p. 40 The first Spanish reconnaissance of this region took place in 1524 by an expedition that included Hernando de Ch√°vez, Juan Dur√°n, Bartolom√© Becerra and Crist√≥bal Salvatierra, amongst others.Dary Fuentes 2008, p. 59. In 1526 three Spanish captains, Juan P√©rez Dard√≥n, Sancho de Barahona and Bartolom√© Becerra, invaded Chiquimula on the orders of Pedro de Alvarado. The indigenous population soon rebelled against excessive Spanish demands, but the rebellion was quickly put down in April 1530.Putzeys and Flores 2007, p. 1475. However, the region was not considered fully conquered until a campaign by Jorge de Bocanegra in 1531‚Äì1532 that also took in parts of Jalapa. The afflictions of Old World diseases, war and overwork in the mines and encomiendas took a heavy toll on the inhabitants of eastern Guatemala, to the extent that indigenous population levels never recovered to their pre-conquest levels.Dary Fuentes 2008, p. 60. =Campaigns in the Cuchumatanes= alt=View over a heavily forested mountain slope towards rugged peaks beyond, separated from them by a mass of low cloud. In the ten years after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q ºanjob ºal.Lim√≥n Aguirre 2008, p. 10. The Spanish were attracted to the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches from the mountains but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult.Lim√≥n Aguirre 2008, p. 11. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because of the effects of the Old World diseases that had run ahead of them. Uspant√°n and the Ixil After the western portion of the Cuchumatanes fell to the Spanish, the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were sufficiently isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529, four years after the conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and Uspant√°n was trying to foment rebellion among the K ºiche º. Uspantek activity became sufficiently troublesome that the Spanish decided that military action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj.Lovell 2005, pp. 64‚Äì65. The Spanish army then marched east toward Uspant√°n itself; Arias then received notice that the acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Ordu√±a, had deposed him as magistrate. Arias handed command over to the inexperienced Pedro de Olmos and returned to confront de Ordu√±a. Although his officers advised against it, Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the Spanish began their assault they were ambushed from the rear by more than two thousand Uspantek warriors. The Spanish forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed on the altar of their deity Exbalamquen. The survivors who managed to evade capture fought their way back to the Spanish garrison at Q ºumarkaj.Lovell 2005, p. 65. A year later Francisco de Castellanos set out from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now relocated to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition against the Ixil and Uspantek, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition rested at Chichicastenango and recruited further forces before marching seven leagues northwards to Sacapulas and climbed the steep southern slopes of the Cuchumatanes. On the upper slopes they clashed with a force of between four and five thousand Ixil warriors from Nebaj and nearby settlements. A lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry managed to outflank the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish force besieged the city, and their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold and set it on fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed the Spanish to storm the entrance and break the defences. The victorious Spanish rounded up the surviving defenders and the next day Castellanos ordered them all to be branded as slaves as punishment for their resistance.Lovell 2005, pp. 65‚Äì66. The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the Spanish as soon as news of the battle reached them. The Spanish continued east towards Uspant√°n to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cun√©n, Sacapulas and Verapaz. The Spaniards were barely able to organise a defence before the defending army attacked. Although heavily outnumbered, the deployment of Spanish cavalry and the firearms of the Spanish infantry eventually decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspant√°n and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes.Lovell 2005, p. 66 Reduction of the Chuj and Q ºanjob ºal In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtat√°n (then known by the name of Ystapalap√°n) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle, a companion of Pedro de Alvarado, together with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction (reducci√≥n in Spanish) of San Mateo Ixtat√°n took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries,INFORPRESSCA 2011. MINEDUC 2001, pp. 14‚Äì15. Lim√≥n Aguirre 2008, p. 10. in the same year the Q ºanjob ºal reducci√≥n settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q ºanjob ºal reducciones were in place at San Pedro Soloma, San Juan Ixcoy and San Miguel Acat√°n by 1560. Q ºanjob ºal resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests from the Spanish reducciones. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia.Hinz 2008, 2010, p. 36. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtat√°n remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance that was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch ºol to the north. The continued resistance was so determined that the Chuj remained pacified only while the immediate effects of the Spanish expeditions lasted.Lim√≥n Aguirre 2008, pp. 10‚Äì11. In the late 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de Le√≥n reported that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtat√°n did not pay tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de Le√≥n informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de Le√≥n was chased out of San Mateo Ixtat√°n by the locals.Lovell 2000, pp. 416‚Äì417. alt=A series of semi-collapsed dry-stone terraces, overgrown with short grass. On top of the uppermost of five terraces stand the crumbling, overgrown remains of two large buildings flanking the ruins of a smaller structure.

The foreground is a flat plaza area, with the collapsed flank of a grass-covered pyramid at bottom right. The sky is overcast with low rainclouds. In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n, the governor of Guatemala, decided on the reduction of San Mateo Ixtat√°n and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the Corregimiento of Huehuetenango.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. 149‚Äì150. On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodr√≠guez Mazariegos, acting under orders from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtat√°n, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from San Mateo itself.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. xxxiii, 153‚Äì154. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtat√°n were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Pet√©n Basin.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. 154. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Crist√≥bal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. 154‚Äì155. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtat√°n on 3 February, where Captain Rodr√≠guez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepci√≥n also remained in the town.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. 156. Governor Enriquez de Guzm√°n subsequently left San Mateo Ixtat√°n for Comit√°n in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. 156, 160. In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtat√°n, Cob√°n and Ocosingo.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xxxiii. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtat√°n. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed on the way to recruit 200 indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solom√° and San Mateo itself.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xxxiv. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle. Pacific lowlands: Pipil and Xinca Before the arrival of the Spanish, the western portion of the Pacific plain was dominated by the K ºiche º and Kaqchikel states,Fox 1981, p. 321. while the eastern portion was occupied by the Pipil and the Xinca.Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 111. The Pipil inhabited the area of the modern department of Escuintla and a part of Jutiapa;Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 113. the main Xinca territory lay to the east of the main Pipil population in what is now Santa Rosa department;Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 114. there were also Xinca in Jutiapa. Page from the Lienzo de Tlaxcala depicting the conquest of Izcuintepeque In the half century preceding the arrival of the Spanish, the Kaqchikel were frequently at war with the Pipil of Izcuintepeque (modern Escuintla).Fox 1981, p. 326. By March 1524 the K ºiche had been defeated, followed by a Spanish alliance with the Kaqchikel in April of the same year. On 8 May 1524, soon after his arrival in Iximche and immediately following his subsequent conquest of the Tz ºutujil around Lake Atitl√°n, Pedro de Alvarado continued southwards to the Pacific coastal plain with an army numbering approximately 6000,Most of these were native allies. where he defeated the Pipil of Panacal or Panacaltepeque (called Panatacat in the Annals of the Kaqchikels) near Izcuintepeque on 9 May.Fowler 1985, p. 41. Recinos 1998, p. 29. Matthew 2012, p. 81. Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult, covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead. The Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain, believing that the Spanish and their allies would not be able to reach the town that day. However, Pedro de Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared, with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain. In the battle that ensued, the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest, sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation. Pedro de Alvarado ordered the town to be burnt and sent messengers to the Pipil lords demanding their surrender, otherwise he would lay waste to their lands. According to Alvarado's letter to Cort√©s, the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him, accepting the king of Spain as their overlord.Batres 2009, p. 65. The Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days.Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 117. A few years later, in 1529, Pedro de Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque, amongst other atrocities.Batres 2009, p. 66. The Pacific slope of Jutiapa was the scene of a number of battles with the Xinca. In Guazacap√°n, now a municipality in Santa Rosa, Pedro de Alvardo described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca.Letona Zuleta et al., p. 5. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec.Letona Zuleta et al., p. 6. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 87. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army.Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 87‚Äì88. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies. Pedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla. Alvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the enemy but they failed to return. Messengers from the city of Pazaco, in the modern department of Jutiapa,Mendoza Asencio 2011, pp. 34‚Äì35. offered peace to the conquistadors but when Alvarado arrived there the next day the inhabitants were preparing for war. Alvarado's troops encountered a sizeable quantity of gathered warriors and quickly routed them through the city's streets. From Pazaco Alvarado crossed the R√≠o Paz and entered what is now El Salvador.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 88. After the conquest of the Pacific plain, the inhabitants paid tribute to the Spanish in the form of valuable products such as cacao, cotton, salt and vanilla, with an emphasis on cacao.Batres 2009, p. 84. Northern lowlands The Contact Period in Guatemala's northern Pet√©n lowlands lasted from 1525 through to 1700.Rice and Rice 2009, p. 5. Superior Spanish weaponry and the use of cavalry, although decisive in the northern Yucat√°n, were ill-suited to warfare in the dense forests of lowland Guatemala. =Cort√©s in Pet√©n= alt=Painting of Hern√°n Cort√©s In 1525, after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern√°n Cort√©s led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Pet√©n Department of Guatemala.Jones 2000, p. 358. His aim was to subdue the rebellious Crist√≥bal de Olid, whom he had sent to conquer Honduras, but Crist√≥bal de Olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761. Cort√©s had 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. He also had with him 600 Chontal Maya carriers from Acalan. They arrived at the north shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° on 13 March 1525.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 761‚Äì762. Cort√©s accepted an invitation from Aj Kan Ek º, the king of the Itza, to visit Nojpet√©n (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Jones 2000, p. 358. On his departure from Nojpet√©n, Cort√©s left behind a cross and a lame horse. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cort√©s' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpet√©n. From the lake, Cort√©s continued south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cort√©s turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of Lake Izabal, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them out to safety. Cort√©s found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay,Feldman 1998, p. 6. with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the course of the next week. By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cort√©s succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Crist√≥bal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion.Webster 2002, p. 83. Cort√©s constructed an improvised brigantine and, accompanied by canoes, he ascended the Dulce River to Lake Izabal, with about 40 Spaniards, and a number of Indians. He at first believed he had reached the Pacific, but soon realised his error. At the western end of the lake, he marched inland and engaged in battle with the Maya natives at the city of Chacujal, on the Polochic River.van Akkeren 2010, p. 173. He seized plentiful supplies of food from the city and sent supplies back to Nito in the brigantine. He had rafts built to ferry supplies back downriver, and returned to Nito with them, while most of his men marched back overland.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 17. Cort√©s then returned to Mexico by sea. =Land of War: Verapaz= alt=Painting of Bartolom√© de las Casas By 1537 the area immediately north of the new colony of Guatemala was being referred to as the Tierra de Guerra (\\"Land of War\\").Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xvi.The colony of Guatemala at this time consisted only of the highlands and Pacific plain. Lovell et al. 1984, p. 460. Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as Verapaz (\\"True Peace\\").Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xvii. The Land of War described an area that was undergoing conquest; it was a region of dense forest that was difficult for the Spanish to penetrate militarily. Whenever the Spanish located a centre of population in this region, the inhabitants were moved and concentrated in a new colonial settlement near the edge of the jungle where the Spanish could more easily control them. This strategy resulted in the gradual depopulation of the forest, simultaneously converting it into a wilderness refuge for those fleeing Spanish domination, both for individual refugees and for entire communities, especially those congregaciones that were remote from centres of colonial authority.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xviii. The Land of War, from the 16th century through to the start of the 18th century, included a vast area from Sacapulas in the west to Nito on the Caribbean coast and extended northwards from Rabinal and Salam√°,Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xix. and was an intermediate area between the highlands and the northern lowlands.Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, pp. 51‚Äì52. It includes the modern departments of Baja Verapaz and Alta Verapaz, Izabal and Pet√©n, as well as the eastern part of El Quich√© and a part of the Mexican state of Chiapas.ITMB Publishing 1998. The western portion of this area was the territory of the Q ºeqchi º Maya.Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 48. Pedro Orozco,His baptismal name. the leader of the Sacatep√©quez Mam of San Marcos department, lent willing help to the Dominicans in their campaign to peacefully subject the inhabitants of Verapaz. On 1 May 1543 Carlos V rewarded the Sacatep√©quez Mam by issuing a royal order promising never to give them in encomienda.Calder√≥n Cruz 1994, p. 24. Dominican friar Bartolom√© de las Casas arrived in the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and immediately campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xx. Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith.Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xxi. It was the Dominicans who promoted the use of the name Verapaz instead of the Land of War. Because of the fact that the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. Las Casas and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cob√°n, and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way they congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal.Wagner and Parish 1967, pp. 86‚Äì93. Las Casas became instrumental in the introduction of the New Laws in 1542, established by the Spanish Crown to control the excesses of the conquistadors and colonists against the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas. As a result, the Dominicans met substantial resistance from the Spanish colonists, who saw their own interests threatened by the New Laws; this distracted the Dominicans from their efforts to establish peaceful control over the Land of War. In 1543 the new colonial reducci√≥n of Santo Domingo de Cob√°n was founded at Chi Mon ºa to house the relocated Q ºeqchi º from Chichen, Xucaneb and Al Run Tax Aj. Santo Tom√°s Ap√≥stol was founded nearby the same year at Chi Nim Xol, it was used in 1560 as a reducci√≥n to resettle Ch ºol communities from Topiltepeque and Lacandon in the Usumacinta Valley.Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 52. Josserand and Hopkins 2001, p. 3. In 1555 the Acala Ch ºol and their Lacandon allies killed the Spanish friar Domingo de Vico.Caso Barrera 2007, p. 53. Thompson 1938, pp. 586‚Äì587. De Vico had established a small church among the inhabitants of San Marcos,Salazar 1620, 2000, p.38. a region that lay between the territories of the Lacandon and the Manche Ch ºol (an area unrelated to the department of San Marcos).Salazar 1620, 2000, p. 37. De Vico had offended the local ruler by repeatedly scolding him for taking several wives. The indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then seized him, cut open his chest and extracted his heart.Salazar 1620, 2000, p.39. His corpse was then decapitated; the natives carried off his head, which was never recovered by the Spanish.Salazar 1620, 2000, p.35. In response a punitive expedition was launched, headed by Juan Matalbatz, a Q ºeqchi º leader from Chamelco; the independent Indians captured by the Q ºeqchi º expedition were taken back to Cob√°n and resettled in Santo Tom√°s Ap√≥stol.Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 53. =Lake Izabal and the lower Motagua River= Gil Gonz√°lez D√°vila set out from the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524,Newson 1986, 2007, p. 145. Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 11. with the intention of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 11. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil G√≥nzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala.Recinos1952,1986, p. 111. Leonard 2011, p. 18. Gonz√°lez left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista,Sarmiento 1990, 2006, p. 18. and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cort√©s passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 16. The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631.Feldman 1998, p. 7. In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became governor of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As a result of the survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered the construction of a new port, named Santo Tom√°s de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake. Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the Motagua Valley into the highlands. Indigenous guides scouting the route from the highlands would not proceed further downriver than three leagues below Quirigu√°, because the area was inhabited by the hostile Toquegua.Feldman 1998, p. 8. The Castillo de San Felipe was a Spanish fort that guarded the entrance to Lake Izabal. The leaders of Xocolo and Amatique, backed by the threat of Spanish action, persuaded a community of 190 Toquegua to settle on the Amatique coast in April 1604. The new settlement immediately suffered a drop in population, but although the Amatique Toquegua were reported extinct before 1613 in some sources, Mercedarian friars were still attending to them in 1625. In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch ºol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Francisco Mor√°n as their ecclesiastical head. Mor√°n favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements.Feldman 2000, p. xxii. By 1699 the neighbouring Toquegua no longer existed as a separate people because of a combination of high mortality and intermarriage with the Amatique Indians.Feldman 1998, p. 10. At around this time the Spanish decided on the reduction of the independent (or \\"wild\\" from the Spanish point of view) Mopan Maya living to the north of Lake Izabal.Feldman 1998, pp. 10‚Äì11. The north shore of the lake, although fertile, was by then largely depopulated, therefore the Spanish planned to bring the Mopan out of the forests to the north into an area where they could be more easily controlled.Feldman 1998, p. 11. During the campaign to conquer the Itza of Pet√©n, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch ºol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east. They were resettled in the Colonial reducci√≥n of San Antonio de las Bodegas on the south shore of the lake and in San Pedro de Amatique. By the latter half of the 18th century, the indigenous population of these towns had disappeared; the local inhabitants now consisted entirely of Spaniards, mulattos and others of mixed race, all associated with the Castillo de San Felipe de Lara fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal. The main cause of the drastic depopulation of Lake Izabal and the Motagua Delta was the constant slave raids by the Miskito Sambu of the Caribbean coast that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery, a practise which was widespread among the Miskito.Feldman 1998, p. 12. =Conquest of Pet√©n= alt=Northern Guatemala is a flat lowland plain dropping off from the Cuchumatanes mountain range sweeping across in an arc to the south. To the east of the mountains is the large lowland Lake Izabal, with an outlet into the Amatique Bay to the east, which itself opens onto the Gulf of Honduras. Immediately north of the mountains is the Lacandon forest, with Pet√©n to the northeast. Ystapalap√°n was a settlement in the western Cuchumatanes, in the territory of the Chuj. Cob√°n was in Q ºeqchi º territory, in the foothills halfway between Ystapalap√°n in the west and Lake Izabal in the east. Xocolo was at the northeastern extreme of Lake Izabal, where it flows out towards the sea. Nito, also known as Amatique, was on the coast where the river flowing out of the lake opened into the Amatique Bay. The area south of the lake was Toquegua territory. The Manche occupied the lands to the northwest of the lake, with the Acala to their west between the Manche and the Chuj. The Lacandon were northwest of the Acala, straddling the border with Mexico. Lake Pet√©n Itz√° was in the centre of Pet√©n, to the north. It was the location of Nojpet√©n, with the Itza lands stretching southwards from the lake. To the east of the Itza and northeast of the Manche were the Mopan, on the border with Belize. North of the Mopan were the Yalain, east of Lake Pet√©n Itz√°. The Kowoj were to the northeast of the lake and the Kejache to the northwest. The \\"Tierra de Guerra\\" (\\"Land of War\\") covers a broad northern swathe of the mountains and the southern portion of the lowlands. From 1527 onwards the Spanish were increasingly active in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, establishing a number of colonies and towns by 1544, including Campeche and Valladolid in what is now Mexico.Jones 2000, pp. 358‚Äì360. The Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, within the modern borders of Guatemala.Jones 2000, pp. 360‚Äì361. The Spanish were aware that the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti- Spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their trade routes over the course of almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the slow Spanish advance.Jones 2000, p. 361. Dominican missionaries were active in Verapaz and the southern Pet√©n from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century the Franciscans came to the conclusion that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Pet√©n Itz√°. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the encomiendas. Fray Bartolom√© de Fuensalida visited Nojpet√©n in 1618 and 1619.Rice and Rice 2009, p. 11. The Franciscan missionaries attempted to use their own reinterpretation of the k ºatun prophecies when they visited Nojpet√©n at this time, to convince the current Aj Kan Ek º and his Maya priesthood that the time for conversion had come.Jones 2000, pp. 361‚Äì362. But the Itza priesthood interpreted the prophecies differently, and the missionaries were fortunate to escape with their lives. In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucat√°n, and Guatemalan soldiers conquered a number of Ch ºol communities, the most important being Sakb ºajlan on the Lacant√∫n River in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Se√±ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon. The Franciscan friar Andr√©s de Avenda√±o oversaw a second attempt to overcome the Itza in 1695, convincing the Itza king that the K ºatun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. However the Itza had local Maya enemies who resisted this conversion, and in 1696 Avenda√±o was fortunate to escape with his life. The Itza's continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpet√©n once and for all.Jones 2000, p. 362. Fall of Nojpet√©n Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of lake Pet√©n Itz√° with his soldiers in February 1697, and once there built a galeota, a large and heavily armed oar-powered attack boat.Jones 2009, p. 59. The Itza capital fell in a bloody waterborne assault on 13 March 1697.Jones 2000, p. 362. Jones 2009, p. 59. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island; many Itza Maya who fled to swim across the lake were killed in the water. After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. The Itza and Kowoj kings (Ajaw Kan Ek º and Aj Kowoj) were soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With Nojpet√©n safely in the hands of the Spanish, Urs√∫a returned to Campeche; he left a small garrison on the island, isolated amongst the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. Nojpet√©n was renamed by the Spanish as Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (\\"Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza\\"). The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race ladino civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to the colonial capital; Ajaw Kan Ek º and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the capital. =Final years of conquest= In the late 17th century the small population of Ch ºol Maya in southern Pet√©n and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Q ºeqchi º population. The Ch ºol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the early 18th century.Jones 2000, p. 365. Catholic priests from Yucat√°n founded several mission towns around Lake Pet√©n Itz√° in 1702‚Äì1703. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704, but although well- planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet√©n, compared to ten times that number in 1697. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.Jones 2009, p. 60. Legacy of the Spanish conquest The initial shock of the Spanish conquest was followed by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike. Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements laid out in a grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ayuntamiento. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area.Coe 1999, p. 231. The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendants (the criollos) or was tightly controlled by them.Megged 1992, p. 440. Coe 1999, p. 231. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism.Coe 1999, pp. 231‚Äì232. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the marimba, a musical instrument of African origin.Coe 1999, p. 233. The greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre-Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of game. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour.Coe 1999, p. 232. Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya, concentrated in the central and western highlands. The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and hispanicization. Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race, with Maya peasants and artisans at the bottom, the mixed-race ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and lower class and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry.Smith 1997, p. 60. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period; a prominent Kaqchikel noble family, they chronicled the history of their region.Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 104.

It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Versions are available as the combination telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide and telmisartan/amlodipine. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, and back pain. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Telmisartan was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS less than ¬£2 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$10. In 2017, it was the 249th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses Telmisartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. Contraindications Telmisartan is contraindicated during pregnancy. Like other drugs affecting the renin‚Äìangiotensin system (RAS), telmisartan can cause birth defects, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. It is not known whether the drug passes into the breast milk.Drugs.com: Micardis Also it is contraindicated in bilateral renal artery stenosis in which it can cause kidney failure. Side effects Side effects are similar to other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and include tachycardia and bradycardia (fast or slow heartbeat), hypotension (low blood pressure) and edema (swelling of arms, legs, lips, tongue, or throat, the latter leading to breathing problems). Allergic reactions may also occur.  Interactions  Due to its mechanism of action, telmisartan increases blood potassium levels. Combination with potassium preparations or potassium-sparing diuretics could cause hyperkalaemia (excessive potassium levels). Combination with NSAIDs, especially in patients with impaired kidney function, has a risk of causing (usually reversible) kidney failure. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker that shows high affinity for the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1), with a binding affinity 3000 times greater for AT1 than AT2. In addition to blocking the RAS, telmisartan acts as a selective modulator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Œ≥), a central regulator of insulin and glucose metabolism. It is believed that telmisartan's dual mode of action may provide protective benefits against the vascular and renal damage caused by diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Telmisartan's activity at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-Œ¥) receptor has prompted speculation around its potential as a sport doping agent as an alternative to GW 501516. Telmisartan activates PPAR-Œ¥ receptors in several tissues. Also, Telmisartan has a PPARŒ≥ agonist activity. =Pharmacokinetics= The substance is quickly but to varying degrees absorbed from the gut. The average bioavailability is about 50% (42‚Äì100%). Food intake has no clinically relevant influence on the kinetics of telmisartan. Plasma protein binding is over 99.5%, mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. It has the longest half-life of any ARB (24 hours)Pritor prescribing information and the largest volume of distribution among ARBs (500 liters). Less than 3% of telmisartan is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver, and over 97% is eliminated in unchanged form via bile and faeces. History Society and culture Telmisartan is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS less than ¬£2 as of 2019. In the United States the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost of this amount is about US$10 as of 2019.

It also serves the nearby communities of Nobleton, Oak Ridges, the northern parts of Maple (in Vaughan), and other communities in King Township. It is a stop on the Barrie line train service. History The original King Station was built in 1852 at a location less than a kilometre north of the current station, adjacent to the community's inn. It was moved to the grounds of the King Township Museum in 1989, and was designated a heritage site in 1990. =GO Transit= The GO Station opened on 7 September 1982, with service extending south to Toronto and north to Bradford. In 2002, with infrastructure funding from the provincial government, GO Transit expanded the station's parking lot capacity from 111 spaces to 255. During 2004, the platform was extended in order to accommodate longer trainsets, thus removing any boarding restrictions that GO Transit had with this station prior to opening the extended rail platform. In addition, the extension also eliminated the problem of GO trains blocking a railroad crossing on Station Road while passengers boarded and disembarked. Construction of a covered station building was completed in the summer of 2005, and a second parking lot on the west side of the tracks was opened in February 2006. Services As of January 2018, train service operates approximately every 15-30 minutes in the morning peak period, every 30 minutes in the afternoon peak period and every hour at other times. Outside of peak periods, most trains terminate at Aurora with connecting buses for stations further north. On weekends and holidays, service operates approximately every hour to and from Union Station, with most trains terminating at Aurora station. Three daily trains in each direction cover the full route from Barrie to Toronto, while the remainder have bus connections at Aurora station for stations further north. Connecting York Region Transit and GO buses serve the station from a bus stop on Keele Street at Station Road. Ridership Daily train boarding at the station has increased from 199 in 2005 to a peak of 680 in 2008. In 2012, there were 655 daily boardings, or approximately 170,000 riders annually. GO Transit bus route 63, which travels between the King City GO Station and Union Station Bus Terminal via Maple and Rutherford GO stations, served a daily average of 450 riders at this station in 2012.

Masters Because they supply power only occasionally, the power supplied commands a much higher price per kilowatt hour than base load power. Peak load power plants are dispatched in combination with base load power plants, which supply a dependable and consistent amount of electricity, to meet the minimum demand. Although historically peaking power plants were frequently used in conjunction with coal baseload plants, peaking plants are now used less commonly. Combined cycle gas turbine plants have two or more cycles, the first of which is very similar to a peaking plant, with the second running on the waste heat of the first. That type of plant is capable of rapidly starting up, albeit at reduced efficiency, and then over some hours transitioning to a more efficient baseload generation mode. Combined cycle plants have similar capital cost per watt to peaking plants, but run for much longer periods and hence give cheaper electricity. Peak hours Peak hours usually occur in the morning or late afternoon/evening depending on location. In temperate climates, peak hours often occur when household appliances are heavily used in the evening after work hours. In hot climates, the peak is usually late afternoon when air conditioning load is high, during this time many workplaces are still open and consuming power. In cold climates, the peak is in the morning when space heating and industry are both starting up.Dennis R. Landsberg, Ronald Stewart: Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings pg 284 books.google.ca, accessed 16 November 2019 A peaker plant may operate many hours a day, or it may operate only a few hours per year, depending on the condition of the region's electrical grid. Because of the cost of building an efficient power plant, if a peaker plant is only going to be run for a short or highly variable time, it does not make economic sense to make it as efficient as a base load power plant. In addition, the equipment and fuels used in base load plants are often unsuitable for use in peaker plants because the fluctuating conditions would severely strain the equipment. For these reasons, nuclear, waste-to-energy, coal and biomass are rarely, if ever, operated as peaker plants. Power production in Germany during a day in 2005, without any solar and wind power Renewable energy For countries that are trending away from coal-fired base load plants and towards intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar, there is a corresponding increase in the need for peaking or load following power plants and the use of grid interties, such as the WECC Intertie Paths. Types Peaker plants are generally gas turbines or gas engines that burn natural gas. A few burn biogas or petroleum-derived liquids, such as diesel oil and jet fuel, but they are generally more expensive than natural gas, so their use is limited to areas not supplied with natural gas. However, many peaker plants are able to use petroleum as a backup fuel, as storing oil in tanks is easy. The thermodynamic efficiency of simple- cycle gas turbine power plants ranges from 20 to 42%, with between 30 and 42% being average for a new plant. For greater efficiency, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) is added at the exhaust. This is known as a combined cycle plant. Cogeneration uses waste exhaust heat for process, district heating or other heating uses. Both of these options are used only in plants that are intended to be operated for longer periods than usual. Natural gas and diesel generators with reciprocating engines are sometimes used for grid support using smaller plants. Another option for increased efficiency and power output in gas turbines is installing a turbine inlet air cooling system, that cools down the inlet air temperature increasing mass flow ratio. This option, in combination with a thermal energy storage tank, can increase the turbine power output in on-peak periods up to 30%. BPA Daily peak load with large hydro/base load thermal generation and intermittent wind power. Hydro is managing the peaks, with some response from thermal. Hydroelectric dams are intentionally variable; they can generate less during off-peak and quickly respond to peak demands, consequently hydroelectricity may function as load following or a peaking plant and with sufficient water, a base-load plant. Natural gas turbines or pumped storage are often used where there is not enough hydroelectricity to respond to daily and weekly variations in generation and consumption. It is not unusual for a dam to be built with more capacity than can be sustained by the water supply, allowing for a higher peak output. Upgrading equipment at existing dams can be one of the least expensive ways of increasing peak generation.Reclamation: Managing water in the West HydroElectric Power www.usbr.gov, accessed 16 November 2019 The ability to vary the amount of electricity generated is often limited by the requirement that minimum or maximum flows downstream are satisfied. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available, used for averaging off-peak and peak electrical demands. The site stores energy using the gravitational potential of water stored in a reservoir. Low-cost off-peak electric power from base load or intermittent sources is used to pump water at a low elevation to storage in a high elevation reservoir. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power. Start up times are only a few minutes, and some can start in a few tens of seconds. Batteries are used in some cases where conditions favor it to smooth flow (avoiding a costly power line upgrade) as well as supplying peak power and other grid services such as operating reserve, sometimes in hybrid configuration with turbines or diesel engines. Battery power is by far the fastest responding of all powerplants, and can respond to grid conditions at millisecond timescales, giving slower responding equipment a chance to react to outages. Pumped- storage and batteries are net consumers, as they have no inherent energy source, and the conversion between electricity and storage and back incurs some losses. Solar thermal peaker plants were proposed in 2017, under a US Department of Energy Technology 2 Market award to Hank Price of SolarDynamics, whose paper \\"Dispatchable Solar Power Plant\\" proposed utilizing the thermal energy storage inherent in a solar thermal energy power plant, that enables this heat-based form of solar to generate like a gas peaker, to supply power on demand day or night, and in return be controlled by the utility and paid in capacity payments to be available when needed, like a traditional peaker plant. A solar thermal power plant makes electricity in a steam cycle power plant like a traditional power plant but the heat for steam is supplied by solar energy heating a material such as molten salts and storing the heat until needed to make steam for power generation. Base load power plants The opposites of peaking plants are base load power plants. Nuclear and coal burning plants generally operate continuously, stopping only for maintenance or unexpected outages. The high cost per watt of Nuclear power and other technical issues, make them relatively expensive and awkward to use for load following and peaking. Intermediate load following power plants such as hydroelectric operate between these extremes, curtailing their output on nights and weekends when demand is low. Base load and intermediate plants are used preferentially to meet electrical demand because the lower efficiencies of peaker plants make them more expensive to operate.

His credits include work on the adornments of the Louvre, and numerous sculptures around the world. Sicard was born in Tours, studied with Louis-Ernest Barrias, and is known for his lithography and his fiercely patriotic original works of art.

Priming ensures better adhesion of paint to the surface, increases paint durability, and provides additional protection for the material being painted. Composition A primer consists of 20‚Äì30% synthetic resin, 60‚Äì80% solvent and 2‚Äì5% additive agent. Some primer contains polyethylene (plastic), for better durability. Use Primer is a paint product that allows finishing paint to adhere much better than if it were used alone. It is designed to adhere to surfaces and to form a binding layer that is better prepared to receive the paint. Compared to paint, a primer is not intended to be used as the outermost durable finish and can instead be engineered to have improved filling and binding properties with the material underneath. Sometimes this is achieved by chemistry, as in the case of aluminium primer, but more often this is achieved through controlling the primer's physical properties such as its porosity, tackiness, and hygroscopy. Primer as a step in the coating process of a car body. In practice, primer is often used when painting porous materials, including concrete and wood. Using a primer is considered mandatory if the material is not water resistant and will be exposed to the elements. Priming gypsum board (drywall) is also standard practice with new construction because it seals the wall from moisture and can prevent the growth of mold. Primers can also be used on dirty surfaces which cannot be cleaned or before painting light colors over a dark finish. Some primers can be tinted to match more closely with the color of the finishing paint. If the finishing paint is a deep color, tinting the primer can reduce the number of layers of finishing paint that are necessary for good uniformity across the painted surface. Primers are also used to hide joints and seams to give a finished look. Some primers require that the topcoat be applied within a certain amount of time after the primer dries to ensure optimal adhesion. This varies from 24 hours to up to two weeks after the primer has dried. Painting after the suggested time-frame may cause performance issues depending on the specific situation. It is common to apply the finishing coat of paint before the primer fully cures in order to improve adhesion between the primer and the topcoat. The level of exposure, such as indoors versus outdoors, may affect how important applying the topcoat within the time-frame will be. =On wood= Wood is very porous and will absorb the solvent in paint and cause it to dry more quickly. This is undesirable because most paints undergo chemical reactions during the process of curing (for example, latex- and alkyd-based paints polymerise when curing) which is dependent on the water or solvent evaporating slowly. A layer of primer will prevent the underlying wood from prematurely absorbing the solvents in the finishing paint. Primer can reduce the number of paint coats needed for good coverage and even color. A thin layer of paint may still be permeable to water. Water can permeate into the wood and cause warping, mildew, or dry rot. Primer improves the waterproofing of the finish. Primers are often comparable in price to finish paints and the price is influenced by the quality of the ingredients. Primers for some specialty applications can be expensive. Primers are not used as part of a wood stain treatment because they obscure the wood grain. Primer differs from wood sealers in that sealers typically don't obscure the wood grain completely. =On metal= Zinc chromate primer Some metals, such as untreated aluminium, require a primer; others may not. A primer designed for metal is still highly recommended if a part is to be exposed to moisture. Once water seeps through to the bare metal, oxidation will begin (plain steel will simply rust). Metal primers might contain additional materials to protect against corrosion, such as sacrificial zinc. Metal hydroxides/oxides do not provide a solid surface for the paint to adhere to, and paint will come off in large flakes. Using a primer will provide extra insurance against such a scenario. An additional reason for using a primer on metal could be the poor condition of the surface. A steel part can be rusty, for example. Although the metal can be thoroughly cleaned by blasting, when this is not possible then special kinds of primer can be used that chemically convert rust to the solid metal salts. Even though such a surface is still lacking in comparison to new metal, it is much better than weak, porous rust. Painting and gluing aluminium is especially important in the aircraft industry, which uses toxic zinc chromate primers and chromating to add the necessary adhesion properties. =On plastic= Using a primer on surfaces made of plastic is only necessary when making a drastic change of colour (going from dark brown to white, for example), because most household plastics are not very porous and are not easily damaged by moisture; or when a long- lasting coat of paint is desired. A primer will reduce the number of layers of paint necessary to completely cover the previous colour, and will help the paint make a thorough bond with the surface being painted. Because most paints and primers designed to be used for painting plastics are not water based, an important point for choosing a primer for plastic is making sure the primer's propellant or solvent will not dissolve or warp the plastic part itself (e.g. most common household spray paint will damage polystyrene foam) For this reason, most manufacturers recommend that both the primer and paint should be tested on a less visible location of the part being painted. =Alternatives= Alternative surface treatments, such as plasma activation, can replace primers in the cases when the latter are used to improve adhesive bonding between the substrate and the paint or the lacquer. Quality of the adhesive bonding, such as varnishing and painting, depends strongly on the ability of the adhesive to efficiently cover (wet) the substrate area. This happens when the surface energy of the substrate is greater than the surface energy of the adhesive. However, high strength adhesives ‚Äì lacquers and paints ‚Äì have high surface energy. Thus, their application is problematic for low surface energy materials such as polymers or oxidized metals. To solve this problem, plasma activation is used as a preparation step before adhesive bonding. It cleans the polymer surface from the organic contaminants, removes a weak boundary layer, strengthens the surface by cross-linking polymer molecules and chemically bonds to the substrate a strong layer with high surface energy and chemical affinity to the adhesive.‚ÄúVarnishing and painting improvement using plasma‚Äù Moreover, plasma processing can also reduce or remove hard oxides from metal surfaces, enabling painting and gluing of metals such as copper and aluminium. Importantly, plasma activation can be performed at the atmospheric pressure in air with fast processing speeds. It does not use wet chemistry, which positively affects its costs, safety and environmental impact.

It is located next to Alberta Highway 2A, near the Queen Elizabeth II Highway. Didsbury is within the Calgary-Edmonton corridor. Didsbury is approximately the half-way point between the cities of Calgary and Red Deer. Didsbury is surrounded by Mountain View County, which has its municipal office located to the north of the town. The nearest neighbouring communities are the towns of Olds to the north and Carstairs to the south.  History  Didsbury, circa 1905 Main Street in Didsbury The town is named after the township of Didsbury, now a suburban area of Manchester, England. The first settlers were Dutch Mennonites who left their homes in Pennsylvania and emigrated as United Empire Loyalists to Waterloo County, Ontario. They were granted the area around Didsbury in 1894 by the government of Sir John A. Macdonald. Original settlement in the area was sparse, and this in part explains the initial slow development of the town-site as a service centre. The first concern of the Mennonite settlers was to build a church; and the primary task of the settlers was to create farmsteads. Settlement prior to the post-1900 land rush was limited to the small group who came west in 1894. 1897 saw the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which pushed forward the town's development. The CPR constructed a station in the town in 1904. Didsbury was incorporated as a village in 1905 and as a town on September 6, 1906. Fires in 1914 and 1924 destroyed the early \\"boomtown\\" commercial streetscape and led to the passing by Town Council of a bylaw which required masonry construction for all new downtown commercial buildings. Many of these brick buildings stand today.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Didsbury recorded a population of 5,268 living in 2,031 of its 2,119 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 4,957. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Didsbury had a population of 4,957 living in 1,923 of its 1,987 total dwellings, a 15.1% change from its 2006 adjusted population of 4,305. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. The population of the Town of Didsbury according to its 2008 municipal census is 4,599.  Infrastructure  The town's recreational facilities include six parks, a golf course, aquatic centre, and a hockey rink. There is also a hospital and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment serving the town and the surrounding area. Didsbury has three schools that are under the jurisdiction of the Chinook's Edge School Division. The Olds-Didsbury Airport, which is used primarily for small aircraft and general aviation, is located north of Didsbury along Highway 2A.  Media  The town is served by the Didsbury Review, which is part of the Great West Newspapers chain.Didsbury Review Newspaper site Sport and recreation Didsbury is home to the Mountainview Colts of the Heritage Junior B Hockey League.  Organizations  Organizations present in Didsbury include the Royal Canadian Army Cadets and the 1st Didsbury Scouts, Didsbury Jazzercise, as well as the Elks and Lions clubs.

History  International traders in London, including those from France, Germany and the Netherlands, the Baltic, Hungary, the Mediterranean and the United States, founded the London Corn Trade Association in 1878 in order to standardize shipping documents for exporting nations and to clarify procedures and disputes relating to the quality of imported grain. In the same year, SGS was founded in Rouen, France, by Henri Goldstuck, a young Latvian immigrant who, having seen the opportunities at one of the country‚Äôs largest ports, began to inspect French grain shipments. With the aid of Captain Maxwell Shafftington, he borrowed money from an Austrian friend to start inspecting the shipments arriving in Rouen as, during transit, losses showed in the volume of grain as a result of shrinkage and theft. The service inspected and verified the quantity and quality of the grain on arrival with the importer. Business grew rapidly; the two entrepreneurs went into business together in December 1878 and, within a year, had opened offices in Le Havre, Dunkirk and Marseilles. In 1915, during the First World War, the company moved its headquarters from Paris to Geneva, Switzerland and on July 19, 1919 the company adopted the name Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Surveillance. During the mid-20th century, SGS started offering inspection, testing and verification services across a variety of sectors, including industrial, minerals and oil, gas and chemicals, among others.

It was formally established in 1696 and lasted until being dissolved during the February Revolution of 1917. It developed from a smaller force that had existed prior to Tsar Peter the Great's founding of the modern Russian Navy during the Second Azov campaign. It was expanded in the second half of the 18th century and reached its peak strength by the early part of the 19th century, behind only the British and French fleets in terms of size. Officers were drawn from the aristocracy of the Empire, who belonged to the state Russian Orthodox Church. Young aristocrats began to be trained for leadership at a national naval school. From 1818 on, only officers of the Imperial Russian Navy were appointed to the position of Chief Manager of the Russian- American Company, which was based in Russian America (present-day Alaska) for colonization and fur trade development. After the navy was initially staffed by paid foreign sailors, the government began to recruit native-born sailors as conscripts, drafted as were men to serve in the army. Service in the navy was lifelong. The Russian Navy then went into a period of decline, due to the Empire's slow technical and economic development in the first half of the 19th century. It had a revival in the latter part of the century during the reign of Emperor Nicholas II, but most of its Pacific Fleet along with the Baltic Fleet which was sent to the Far East and was destroyed in the humiliating Russo-Japanese War of 1904. The navy had mixed experiences during the First World War, with the Germans generally gaining the upper hand in the Baltic Sea, while the Russians took control of the Black Sea. The Russian Revolution marked the end of the Imperial Navy; its officers had mostly aligned with the emperor, and the sailors split to fight on either side. The surviving ships were taken over by the Soviet Navy when it was established in 1918 after the Revolution. Background Under Tsar Mikhail I (Mikhail Fyodorovich Romanov), the first three-masted ship built within Russia was finished in 1636. Danish shipbuilders from Holstein built it in Balakhna according to contemporary European design. The ship was christened Frederick; during its maiden voyage on the Caspian Sea, the ship sailed into a heavy storm and was lost at sea. During the Russo-Swedish War, 1656-1658, Russian forces seized the Swedish fortresses of D√ºnaburg and Kokenhusen on the Western Dvina. They renamed the former as Borisoglebsk and the latter as Tsarevich-Dmitriyev. A boyar named Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin founded a shipyard at Tsarevich-Dmitriev fortress and began constructing vessels to sail in the Baltic Sea. In 1661, however, Russia lost this and other captured territories by the Peace of Cardis. Russia agreed to surrender to Sweden all captured territories, and it ordered all vessels constructed at Tsarevich-Dmitriev to be destroyed. Boyar Ordin-Nashchokin turned his attention to the Volga River and Caspian Sea. With the Tsar's approval, the boyar brought Dutch shipbuilding experts to the town of Dedinovo near the confluence of the Oka and Volga rivers. Shipbuilding commenced in the winter of 1667. Within two years, four vessels had been completed: one 22-gun galley, christened –û—Ä—ë–ª (\\"Oryol\\" = \\"Eagle\\"), and three smaller ships. –û—Ä—ë–ª was Russia's first own three-masted, European-designed sailing ship. It was captured in Astrakhan by rebellious Cossacks led by Stepan Razin. The Cossacks ransacked –û—Ä—ë–ª and abandoned it, half-submerged, in an estuary of the Volga. During much of the 17th century, independent Russian merchants and Cossacks, using koch boats, sailed across the White Sea, exploring the rivers Lena, Kolyma and Indigirka, and founding settlements in the region of the upper Amur. The most celebrated Russian explorer was Semyon Dezhnev who, in 1648, sailed along the entire northern expanse of present-day Russia by way of the Arctic Ocean. Rounding the Chukotsk Peninsula, Dezhnev passed through the Bering Sea and sailed into the Pacific Ocean. Reign of Peter the Great , flagship of the Azov flotilla until 1711 Peter the Great established the modern Russian Navy. During the Second Azov campaign of 1696 against Turkey, the Russians for the first time used 2 warships, 4 fireships, 23 galleys and 1300 strugs, built on the Voronezh River. After the occupation of the Azov fortress, the Boyar Duma looked into Peter's report of this military campaign. It passed a decree on October 20, 1696 to commence construction of a navy. This date is considered the official founding of the Imperial Russian Navy. During the Great Northern War of 1700‚Äì1721, the Russians built the Baltic Fleet. The construction of the oared fleet (galley fleet) took place in 1702‚Äì1704 at several shipyards (estuaries of the rivers Syas, Luga and Olonka). In order to defend the conquered coastline and attack enemy's maritime communications in the Baltic Sea, the Russians created a sailing fleet from ships built in Russia and others imported from abroad. From 1703 to 1723, the main naval base of the Baltic Fleet was located in Saint Petersburg and then in Kronstadt. Bases were also created in Reval (Tallinn) and in Vyborg after it was ceded by Sweden after Russo-Swedish War (1741-1743). Vladimirsky Prikaz was the first organization in charge of shipbuilding. Later on, these functions were transferred to the Admiralteyskiy Prikaz (admiralty in St. Petersburg). In 1745 the Russian Navy had 130 sailing vessels, including 36 ships of the line, 9 frigates, 3 shnyavas (—à–Ω—è–≤–∞ ‚Äî a light two- mast ship used for reconnaissance and messenger services), 5 bombardier ships, and 77 auxiliary vessels. The oared fleet consisted of 396 vessels, including 253 galleys and semi-galleys (called —Å–∫–∞–º–ø–∞–≤–µ–∏, or scampavei; a light high- speed galley) and 143 brigantines. The ships were being constructed at 24 shipyards, including the ones in Voronezh, Kazan, Pereyaslavl, Arkhangelsk, Olonets, Petersburg and Astrakhan. The naval officers came from dvoryane (noblemen, aristocrats who belonged to the state Russian Orthodox Church). The regular sailors were conscripts, drafted into military service. The service in the navy was lifelong. Children of noblemen were educated for naval service at the School for Mathematical and Navigational Sciences, which had been founded in 1701 in Moscow's Sukharev Tower. Students were often sent abroad for training in foreign fleets. The Navy also hired foreign nationals, with significant naval experience, to serve in the Russian Navy, such as the Norwegian-Dutch Cornelius Cruys, the Greek Ivan Botsis, or the Scotsman Thomas Gordon. In 1718, the Admiralty Board (–ê–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª—Ç–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤-–∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–≥–∏—è) was established as the highest naval authority in Russia. The naval cathedral in Kronstadt was one of several cathedrals of the Imperial Russian Navy. The organizational principles of the Russian Navy, educational and training methods for preparing future staff, and methods for conducting military action were all summarized in the Naval Charter (1720), written by Peter I himself.–£—Å—Ç–∞–≤ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π (Naval Regulations), –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥, 1763 Peter the Great, Feodor Apraksin, Alexey Senyavin, Naum Senyavin, Admiral Mikhail Golitsyn and others are generally credited for the development of the Russian art of naval warfare. The main principles of naval warfare were further developed by Grigory Spiridov, Feodor Ushakov, and Dmitry Senyavin. Between 1688 and 1725, a period spanning most of Peter's reign, some 1,260 seagoing vessels were built in Russian shipyards for the Imperial Russian Navy. Fleets were launched successively on the White Sea, the Sea of Azov (with access to the Black Sea), the Baltic Sea, and the Caspian Sea (Russo-Persian War of 1722-1723). In 1700, the majority of sailors in the Imperial Russian Navy were foreigners at the start of the Great Northern War. But by 1721, at the end of the same war, the navy had 7,215 native-born sailors. 18th century In the second half of the 18th century, the Russian Navy was built up to support the government's foreign policy. The nation conducted the Russo-Turkish wars for supremacy in the Black Sea. For the first time, Russia sent its squadrons from the Baltic Sea to distant theaters of operations (see Archipelago expeditions of the Russian Navy). Admiral Spiridov's squadron gained supremacy in the Aegean Sea by destroying the Turkish fleet in the Battle of Chesma in 1770. In 1771, the Russian army conquered the coasts of the Kerch Strait and fortresses of Kerch and Yenikale. After having advanced to the Danube, the Russians formed the Danube Military Flotilla for the purpose of guarding the Danube estuary. In 1771 they were guests to the Republic of Ragusa.Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá, page 54, ≈Ωeljko Brnetiƒá, ≈†kolska knjiga, 1990. The Beluga caviar from the Danube was famous, and merchants from the Republic of Ragusa dominated the import-export business in Serbia with the Habsburg Monarchy.Serbien und Montenegro: Raum und Bev√∂lkerung, Geschichte, Sprache und Literatur, Kultur, Politik, Gesellschaft, Wirtschaft, Recht, p. 152, Walter Lukan, Ljubinka Trgovcevic, Dragan Vukcevic, Walter Lukan, Ljubinka Trgovcevic, Dragan Vukcevic, In 1773 the vessels of the Azov Flotilla (created anew in 1771) sailed into the Black Sea. Russia defeated Turkey in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774, gaining control of the Sea of Azov and a part of the Black Sea coastline between the rivers Bug and Dniester. The Crimea was pronounced independent under Russia's protectorate and was annexed by Russia in 1783. In 1778, the Russians founded the port of Kherson. The first battleship of the Black Sea Fleet was commissioned here in 1783. A year later, a squadron had been developed. 19th century Admiralty Board, 1810s By the second half of the 18th century, the Russian Navy had the fourth-largest fleet in the world after Great Britain, Spain and France. The Black Sea Fleet possessed five line-of-battle ships and 19 frigates (1787), and the Baltic Fleet had 23 ships of the line and 130 frigates (1788). In the early 19th century, the Russian Navy consisted of the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets, Caspian Flotilla, White Sea Flotilla and Okhotsk Flotilla. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Russian Navy had limited sea-going capability, with the 1802 Committee to Improve the Condition of the Navy concluding that the dire state of the ships of the Baltic Fleet, suffering as they did from extensive rot and a lack of copper plating, was incapable of defending Kronstadt and St Petersburg. The Committee's chairman, Vorontsov, concluded that \\"It is impossible for Russia to be considered a major naval power, but there is no predictable need or advantage in this status.\\"Beskrovny p. 294 Consequently, the Committee recommended nothing more than limited measures to rectify the state of the fleets, and the Russians retained limited capability at sea thereafter, relying on their military power to defeat Napoleon. In 1802, the Ministry of Naval Military Forces was established (renamed to Naval Ministry in 1815). Battle of Navarino, by Ivan Aivazovsky, showing the Russian squadron, in line ahead (left-centre, white flags with blue transversal crosses) bombarding the Ottoman fleet (right, with red flags) This attitude changed with the accession of Nicholas I in 1825, who less than a month into his reign declared that \\"Russia must become the third naval power after England and France and must be more powerful than any coalition of secondary naval powers.\\"Quoted by Beskrovny p. 296 As a consequence, the 1825 Committee to Organise the Fleet was formed, which outlined an ambitious shipbuilding project which aimed to create the third largest navy in Europe. The growth of the Navy in the years after this greatly bolstered Russian naval capability, expanding both the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets. A Russian squadron under the Dutch Admiral Lodewijk van Heiden fought at the Battle of Navarino in 1827. The Navy was used to great effect during the subsequent Russo-Turkish War (1828-29), utilising the Mediterranean squadron and the Black Sea Fleet to gain command of the Sea from the Ottomans, which contributed to Russian victory and the signing of the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829. In 1826 the Russians built their first armed steamboat Izhora (), equipped with eight cannons. In 1836, they constructed the first paddle steam frigate of the Russian Navy called Bogatyr (displacement ‚Äî , power ‚Äî , armament ‚Äî 28 cannons). The Imperial Russian Navy sent out exploratory expeditions. Between 1803 and 1855, their ships undertook more than 40 circumnavigations and long- distant voyages, most of which were in support of their North Americans colonies in Russian America (Alaska) and Fort Ross in northern California, and their Pacific ports on the eastern seaboard of Siberia. These voyages produced important scientific research materials and discoveries in Pacific, Antarctic and Arctic theatres of operations. In 1863, during the American Civil War, the Russian Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets wintered in the American ports of New York and San Francisco, respectively. Some historians credit this visit as a major factor in deterring France and the UK from entering the war on the Confederate side.Norman E. Saul, Richard D. McKinzie. Russian-American Dialogue on Cultural Relations, 1776-1914 p 95. , 9780826210975 Delahaye states that besides supporting the Union, Russia was also preparing for a war with France and the UK should they intervene in the Polish insurrection of 1863. The Russian Navy was weak and could easily be blockaded in its home ports, but if it was in the US when the war started it could more easily attack British and French commerce. The Imperial Russian Navy continued to expand in the later part of the century becoming the third largest fleet in the world after the UK and France. The expansion accelerated under Emperor Nicholas II who had been influenced by the American naval theoretician Alfred Thayer Mahan. Russian industry, although growing in capacity, was not able to meet the demands and some ships were ordered from the UK, France, Germany, USA, and Denmark. French naval architects in particular had a considerable influence on Russian designs. Crimean War and aftermath Clash between the Russian steam frigate ' and the Turkish steam frigate Pervaz-ƒ± Bahr√Æ on 5 November 1853 ‚Äî the first naval battle between steam ships in history Russia's slow technical and economic development in the first half of the 19th century caused her to fall behind other European countries in the field of steamboat construction. By the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1853, Russia had the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets, Arkhangelsk Flotilla, Caspian Flotilla and Okhotsk Flotilla (altogether, 40 battleships, 15 frigates, 24 corvettes and brigs, 16 steam frigates etc.). The combined number of staff of all the fleets equaled 91,000 people. Despite all this, the reactionary serfdom system had an adverse effect on the development of the Russian Navy. It was especially typical of the Baltic Fleet, which was known for its harsh military drill. Thanks to admirals Mikhail Lazarev, Pavel Nakhimov, Vladimir Kornilov, and Vladimir Istomin, the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet were taught the art of warfare and upholding of military traditions of the Russian Navy, formed in the times of Admiral Ushakov. The Battle of Sinop in 1853 the Black Sea Fleet under Nakhimov made a number of tactical innovations. During the Siege of Sevastopol in 1854‚Äì1855, the Russian sailors used all means possible to defend their base from land and sea. In accordance with the Treaty of Paris, Russia lost the right to have a military fleet in the Black Sea. In the 1860s, the Russian fleet which had relied upon sails lost its significance and was gradually replaced by steam. After the Crimean War, Russia commenced construction of steam-powered ironclads, monitors, and floating batteries. These vessels had strong artillery and thick armor, but lacked seaworthiness, speed and long-distance abilities. In 1861, they built the first steel-armored gunship Opyt (–û–ø—ã—Ç). In 1869, the Russians began the construction of one of the first seafaring ironclads, (–ü—ë—Ç—Ä –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π). Russo-Japanese War On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese naval fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo opened the war with a surprise attack by torpedo boat destroyersGrant p. 12, 13, 15, etc. continuous throughout the book on the Russian ships at Port Arthur, badly damaging two Russian battleships. The attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which the Japanese were unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully under shore batteries (coastal guns)Grant p. 46, 51, 54, 63, etc. throughout the book of the harbor and the Russians declined to leave the harbor for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. After the attack on Port Arthur, the Japanese attempted to deny the Russians use of the port. On the night of 13/14 February, the Japanese attempted to block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several cement-filled steamers in the deep water channel to the port.Grant p. 48-57 But the steamers, driven off course by Russian gunfire were unable to sink them in the designated places, rendering them ineffective. Another attempt to block the harbor entrance on the night of 3/4 May with blockships also failed. =Mine-laying= In March, the energeticGrant p. 93 Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov (1849‚Äì1904) took command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of making plans to break out of the Port Arthur blockade. By then, both sides began a policy of tactical offensive mine-laying by laying mines in each other's ports. This was the first time in warfare that mines were used for offensive purposes. In the past, mines were used as purely defensive purposes by keeping harbors safe from invading warships. The Japanese mine-laying policy was effective at restricting the Russian movement of its ships outside Port Arthur when on 12 April 1904, two Russian battleships; the flagship, , and ran into a Japanese minefield off Port Arthur with both striking mines.Grant p. 127, 128 Petropavlovsk sank within an hour, while Pobeda had to be towed back to Port Arthur for extensive repairs. Makarov died on Petropavlovsk. However, the Russians soon learned the Japanese tactic of offensive minelaying and decided to play the strategy too. On 15 May, two Japanese battleships ‚Äî and , were both lured into a recently laid Russian minefield off Port Arthur, both striking at least two mines. Hatsuse sank within minutes taking 450 sailors with her, while Yashima sank under tow a few hours later.Grant p. 163; Diarist may have only been aware of battleship Hatsuses sinking, as he does not mention the Yashima. However, the commander's diary was translated into two languages between 1905 and 1907 (Spanish and English), so it is highly possible that that information may have been lost during translation The Russian fleet attempted to break out from Port Arthur and proceed to Vladivostok, but they were intercepted and dispersed at the Battle of the Yellow Sea.Grant p. 171-177 The remnant of the Russian fleet remained in Port Arthur, where the ships were slowly sunk by the artillery of the besieging army. Attempts to relieve the city by land also failed, and after the Battle of Liaoyang in late August, the Russians retreated to Mukden (Shenyang). Port Arthur finally fell on 2 January 1905, after a series of brutal, high-casualty assaults. =Russian submarines= By 25 June, the Imperial Russian Navy had purchased (in secrecy) its first naval submarine (known as Madam) from Isaac Rice's Electric Boat Company. This submarine was (originally) built under the direction of Arthur Leopold Busch as the American torpedo boat Fulton. It was a prototype of the (Holland Type 7 Design) known as the Adder-class/ submarines. By 10 October, this first Russian submarine was (officially) commissioned into service (and shipped to) the eastern coast near Vladivostok Russia and was renamed Som or (Catfish). This first Russian submarine was not ready in time for the Russo-Japanese War. The reason behind this delay was partly due to a (late) shipment of torpedoes (that was) originally ordered from Germany in early 1905. Russia soon ordered more submarines (of the same basic design) and they were built under contract with the Holland Company by the Neva Shipbuilding Company located in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1903, the German ship building firm Germaniawerft at Kiel completed Germany's first fully functioning engine powered submarine; Forelle. The submarine was toured (inspected) by Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Prince Heinrich of Prussia was given a brief cruise in the vessel.Showell, p. 22, 25, 201 In April 1904, the Imperial Russian Navy purchased Forelle, and ordered two more submarines of the .Showell, p. 25 These vessels, as well as Forelle were transported along the Trans-Siberian RailwayGrant p. 140 en route to the war zone. Germaniawerft, under the supervision of Spanish naval architect Raymondo Lorenzo d'Euevilley-Montjustin, continued his work on the Karp-class submarines, improving and modifying one into Germany's first U-boat, , which was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy on 14 December 1906.Showell, p. 24 & 30 U-1 was retired in 1919, and is currently on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich.Showell, p. 36 & 37 Due to the ongoing blockade of Port Arthur in 1904, the Imperial Russian Navy dispatched their remaining submarines to Vladivostok, and by the end of 1904 the last of seven subs had reached their new base there. Using the seven boats as a foundation, the Imperial Russian Navy created the world's first operational submarine fleet at Vladivostok on 1 January 1905. On 14 February 1905 the new submarine fleet sent out its first combat patrol consisting of the vessels Som and Delfin. With patrols varying from 24 hours to a few days, the sub fleets first enemy contact occurred on 29 April 1905 when Imperial Japanese Navy torpedo boats fired upon Som, withdrawing after failing to score a hit. On 1 July the Russian submarine Keta made contact with two Japanese torpedo boats in the Tartar Strait. Keta could not submerge quick enough to obtain a firing position and both adversaries broke contact.Olender p. 175 =Battle of Tsushima= The Russians had already been preparing to reinforce their fleet the previous year by sending elements of the Baltic Sea fleet (The Second Pacific Squadron) under Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky around the Cape of Good Hope to Asia, a voyage of over . On 21 October 1904, while passing by the United Kingdom (an ally of Japan but neutral in this war), they nearly provoked a war in the Dogger Bank incident by firing on British fishing boats that they mistook for Japanese torpedo boats. The duration of the Baltic Fleet's journey meant that Admiral Togo was well aware of the Baltic Fleet's progress, and he made plans to meet it before it could reach port at Vladivostok. He intercepted them in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan, in the early morning of 27 May 1905. Although both battleship fleets were on nearly equal footing in regards to the latest in battleship technology, with the British warship designs representing the Imperial Japanese Navy, and predominately the French designs being favored by the Russian fleets;Forczyk p. 11-13 it was the combat experience that Togo had accrued in the 1904 naval battles of Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea, that gave him the edge over the un-tested Admiral Rozhestvensky during the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May.Forczyk p. 41-54 By the end of the day on 27 May, nearly all of Rozhestvensky's battleships were sunk, including his flagship, ; and on the following day, Admiral Nebogatov, who had relieved Rozhestvensky due to his wounds, surrendered the remainder of the fleet to Admiral Togo. Reconstruction prior to World War I At the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Russia fell from being the third greatest naval power to sixth place. The focus of Russian naval activities shifted back from the Far East to the Baltic. The task of the Baltic Fleet was to defend the Baltic Sea and Saint Petersburg from the German Empire. Emperor Nicholas II created a Naval General Staff in 1906. At first, attention was directed to creation of mine-laying and a submarine fleet. An ambitious expansion program was put before the Duma in 1907-1908 but was voted down. The Bosnian Crisis of 1909 forced a strategic reconsideration, and new s, cruisers, and destroyers were ordered for the Baltic Fleet. A worsening of relations with Turkey meant that new ships including the s were also ordered for the Black Sea Fleet. The total Russian naval expenditure from 1906-1913 was $519 million, in fifth place behind Britain, Germany,the United States and France. The re-armament program included a significant element of foreign participation with several ships (including the cruiser Rurik) and machinery ordered from foreign firms. After the outbreak of World War I, ships and equipment being built in Germany were confiscated. Equipment from Britain was slow in reaching Russia or was diverted to the Western Allies' own war effort. World War I =Baltic Sea= The Baltic Fleet's dreadnought in 1916 In the Baltic Sea, Germany and Russia were the main combatants, with a number of British submarines sailing through the Kattegat to assist the Russians, including commanded by Max Horton. With the German fleet larger and more modern (many High Seas Fleet ships could easily be deployed to the Baltic via the Kiel Canal when the North Sea was quiet), the Russians played a mainly defensive role, at most attacking convoys between Germany and Sweden and laying offensive minefields. Russian and British submarines attacked German shipping sailing between Sweden and Germany. With heavy defensive and offensive mining on both sides, fleets played a limited role on the Eastern Front. The Germans mounted major naval attacks on the Gulf of Riga, unsuccessfully in August 1915 and successfully in October 1917, when they occupied the islands in the Gulf (Operation Albion) and damaged Russian ships departing from Riga (Battle of Moon Sound), which had recently been captured by Germany. By March 1918, the Russian Revolution and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk made the Germans masters of the Baltic sea and German fleets transferred troops to support newly independent Finland and to occupy much of Russia, halting only when defeated in the West. The Russians evacuated the Baltic fleet from Helsinki and Reval to Kronstadt during the Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet in March 1918. =Black Sea= The Black Sea Fleet's battleship brigade in line ahead led by The Black Sea was the domain of both the Russian and Ottoman Empires but the Russian fleet dominated the sea. It possessed a large fleet based in Sevastopol and it was led by two skilled commanders: Admiral Eberhart and Admiral Kolchak (who took over in 1916). The war in the Black Sea started when the Ottoman fleet bombarded several Russian cities in October 1914. The most advanced ships in the Ottoman fleet consisted of just two German ships: the battlecruiser and light cruiser , both under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Souchon. Goeben was damaged on at least four occasions and was usually chased back to port by the superior Russian Navy. By the end of 1915, the Russian fleet had nearly complete control of the sea. The Black Sea fleet was used mainly to support General Yudenich in his Caucasus Campaign. For example, in August 1915, a Russian submarine and two Russian destroyers attacked a Turkish convoy of four transports escorted by a cruiser and two destroyers. The Russian ships sank all four transports without losing a ship. Later, during the summer of 1916, the Ottoman army, under, Vehip Pasha, was ordered to re-take Trebizond. The Ottoman forces tried to march along the coast in June but the Russian fleet was able to reduce the speed of their advance to a crawl using naval bombardment to harass marching troops and destroy their supply columns. Eventually the Ottoman army gave up and withdrew. After Admiral Kolchak took command (August 1916), the Russian fleet mined the exit from the Bosporus, preventing nearly all Ottoman ships from entering the Black Sea. Later that year, the naval approaches to Varna were also mined. The greatest loss suffered by the Russian Black Sea fleet was the destruction of the modern dreadnought , which blew up in port on 7 October 1916, just one year after it was commissioned. The sinking of Imperatritsa Mariya was never fully explained; it could have been sabotage or a terrible accident.The History of the Russian Navy - Chapter 11. The Great War - In the Black Sea Revolution and Civil War The Revolution and subsequent civil war devastated the Russian Navy. Only the Baltic fleet based at Petrograd remained largely intact, although it was attacked by the British Royal Navy in 1919. Foreign Interventionists occupied the Pacific, Black Sea and Arctic coasts. Most of the surviving Black Sea Fleet warships, with crews loyal to the White Russian movement, became part of Wrangel's fleet under the control of commander Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel and after evacuating White forces and civilians from the Crimea were eventually interned in Bizerta, Tunisia. Russian sailors fought on both sides in this bloody conflict. The sailors of the Baltic fleet rebelled against harsh treatment by the Soviet authorities in the Kronstadt rebellion of 1921. The surviving ships formed the core of the Soviet Navy on its 1918 establishment, though the remnants of Wrangel's fleet never returned to Russia.

It is Ontario's oldest operating railway station, with passenger service dating back to 1853. History The Maple Grand Trunk station in 1909. Maple Station opened on May 16, 1853 when the service began on the Ontario, Simcoe, and Huron Railroad between Toronto and Machell's Corners (now Aurora). At the time, the station was named \\"Richmond Hill\\", despite being six kilometres west of that community. Train service was extended to Barrie later in 1853, and to Collingwood in 1855. The current station building was constructed in 1903 by the Grand Trunk Railway to replace the original Ontario, Simcoe and Huron building, which had burned down. The Queen Anne style timber frame structure is clad in wood using stick style patterns, and features large gables in its roofline. It is federally protected by the Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act. The building is also protected under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act, as part of the Maple Heritage Conservation District. The building underwent renovations that were completed in January 2014 for million. It included repairs to the facade and interior, replacement of the floor, and an upgrade to the accessibility ramps. An additional 60 parking spaces were added to the station in the spring of 2015. The station will undergo a redevelopment starting in 2019 including the addition of a second rail track, new rail platforms with a full canopy, a new multi-level parking structure connected to the platforms by a pedestrian plaza, and the bus loop will be upgraded. Services As of January 2018, train service operates approximately every 15‚Äì30 minutes in the morning peak period, every 30 minutes in the afternoon peak period and every hour at other times. Outside of peak periods, most trains terminate at Aurora with connecting buses for stations further north. On weekends and holidays, service operates approximately hourly between Aurora and Toronto. Three daily trains in each direction cover the full route from Barrie to Toronto, while the remainder have bus connections at Aurora station for stations further north.

Wright (the author's first such novel, having been written before The Golden Age). It has a sequel, Mists of Everness.  Overview  The novel tells the tale of Raven, son of Raven, who bargains with a necromancer, Koschei the Deathless, to save the life of his pretty young wife Wendy, who is in the terminal ward of the hospital. The price is that Raven must kill an innocent stranger. The stranger selected is Galen Waylock, the youngest and last watchman of an order of guardians protecting mankind from a supernatural invasion through the Gates of Greater Slumber. The conceit is that man has been separated from the world of dreams in order to preserve him: the fairies and gods remembered in myth yearn to re-establish their old rule. The story draws on varied mythological sources. Koschei (or Koschey) the Deathless is from Russian folk tales; the Selkie are from Irish lore, the Kelpie, Scottish; Oberon, Titania, and Merlin the Magician, English. The giants Surtvitnir and Bergelmir are Norse.

Chemical hazards are systems where chemical accidents could occur under certain circumstances. Such events include fires, explosions, leakages or release of toxic or hazardous materials that can cause people illness, injury, or disability. While chemical accidents may occur whenever toxic materials are stored, transported or used, the most severe are industrial accidents, involving major chemical manufacturing and storage facilities. The most dangerous chemical accident in recorded in history was the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy in India, in which more than 3,000 people had died after a highly toxic vapour, (methyl isocyanate), was released at a Union Carbide Pesticides factory. Efforts to prevent accidents range from improved safety systems to fundamental changes in chemical use and manufacture, referred to as primary prevention or inherent safety. In the United States, concern about chemical accidents after the Bhopal disaster led to the passage of the 1986 Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The EPCRA requires local emergency planning efforts throughout the country, including emergency notifications. The law also requires companies to make publicly available information about their storage of toxic chemicals. Based on such information, citizens can identify the vulnerable zones in which severe toxic releases could cause harm or even in some cases death. In 1990, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was established by Congress, though the CSB did not become operational until 1998. The Board's mission is to determine the root causes of chemical accidents and issue safety recommendations to prevent future Safety Performance Indicators. It also organizes workshops on a number of issues related to preparing for, preventing, and responding to chemical accidents.\\"Chemical Accidents: About .\\" OECD Environment Directorate. OECD. 19 July 2007. In the European Union, incidents such as the Flixborough disaster and the Seveso disaster led to legislation such as the Seveso Directive and Seveso planning and provide for safety reports to local authorities.

It was the second of five stations in the non-commercial, listener-sponsored Pacifica Foundation network. KPFK 90.7 FM began broadcasting in April 1959, twelve years after the Pacifica Foundation was created by pacifist Lewis Hill, and ten years after the network's flagship station, KPFA, was founded in Berkeley. KPFK also broadcasts on booster KPFK- FM1 along the Malibu coast, K258BS (99.5 MHz) in China Lake, K254AH (98.7 MHz) in Isla Vista and K229BO 93.7 MHz in Rancho Bernardo, San Diego. With its 110,000-watt main transmitter atop Mount Wilson, KPFK is one of the most powerful FM stations in the western United States. The station can be heard from the California/Mexico border to Santa Barbara to Ridgecrest/China Lake. A second 10-watt translator is licensed in Isla Vista, California, a census- designated place outside Santa Barbara. The transmitter for that station is located atop Gibraltar Peak, allowing its broadcast to be heard over a large portion of southern Santa Barbara County.

He was the son of a wealthy shepherd from the mountains of the Byzantine theme (district) of Paristrion. All contemporaneous chronicles describe Asen I and his brothers as Vlachs. Asen and Peter (who was still known as Theodor at that time) went to see the Byzantine Emperor, Isaac II Angelos, in Thrace in 1185, to demand an estate in the Balkan Mountains. After the Emperor had refused them, the brothers persuaded their compatriots to rise up against the Byzantine Empire. Peter was crowned emperor before the end of the year. After Isaac II defeated them in early 1186, Asen and Peter fled over the Danube, but they returned in the autumn, accompanied by Cuman reinforcements. They captured Paristrion and began pillaging the nearby Byzantine territories. Asen became his brother's co-ruler in 1187 or 1188. Peter made a peace with the Byzantines, but Asen continued the fight. They divided their realm, with Asen receiving Tarnovo and its region. Asen made a series of raids against Byzantine territories and expanded his rule over the lands along the Struma River in the early 1190s. A boyar (aristocrat), Ivanko, stabbed him to death in 1196. Early life The careers of Asen and his brother, Theodor, suggest they were descended from a prominent family,They could directly approach the monarch and mobilize their compatriots. (Simpson 2016, pp. 6‚Äì7.). according to historian Alicia Simpson. Historian Alexandru Madgearu says their father was most probably a wealthy man who owned herds in the Balkan Mountains. Asen's birth date is unknown. The Synodikon of Tsar Boril calls him \\"Ioan Asen Belgun\\". One of the Lives of Ivan of Rila confirms that Ivan (or Ioan) was his baptismal name. His other two names are of Turkic origin: Asen came from a Turkic word meaning \\"sound, safe, healthy\\", Belgun from a word for \\"wise\\". The ethnic background of Asen and his brothers is still a source of controversy among historians. Chronicles written in the late 12th and early 13th centuries unanimously described them as Vlachs. Their close relationship with the Cumans, and the Turkic etymology of Asan's names, implies they were of Cuman or Pecheneg stock. According to a scholarly theory, the multiethnic character of their homeland, the Byzantine theme (or district) of Paristrion, makes it probable that Vlachs, Bulgarians and Cumans were among their ancestors. Robert of Clari, author of a chronicle of the early history of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, stated that Asen (whom Clari confused with his younger brother, Kaloyan) had \\"once [been] a sergeant of the emperor, having charge of one of the emperor's horse farms\\".The Conquest of Constantinople: Robert of Clari (ch. 64.), p. 63. He noted that Asen was obliged to send sixty to one hundred horses to the imperial army at the Emperor's order. According to Simpson, Clari's report may only show that Asen was not a landowner, but a pastoralist. In the autumn of 1185, the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos encamped at Kypsela in Thrace (now ƒ∞psala in Turkey) during his campaign against the Normans of Sicily, who had invaded the Byzantine Empire. Theodor and Asen came to the camp to meet with the Emperor. Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates suggests they came only to provide grounds for their uprising. Clari says, Asen, as the manager of an imperial horse farm, was to come to the imperial court \\"once a year\\". Theodor and Asen requested a grant from the Emperor, but its nature is uncertain. The words of Choniates, who recorded the events, suggest they applied for a pronoia (revenues of an imperial estate). On the other hand, a pronoia of little value was seldom granted personally by the monarch. This implies the brothers demanded something more, such as the governorship of a district, or the administration of a semi-independent territory, according to modern scholarly theories. The Emperor rebuffed the brothers' request, but they dared to argue with his decision. Asen, whom Choniates characterized as the \\"more insolent and savage of the two\\", was especially impertinent and was \\"struck across the face and rebuked for impudence\\"O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (5.1.369), p. 204. at the command of Isaac II's uncle, John Doukas. They were not detained and could leave the Emperor's camp.  Uprising  = Beginnings = Byzantine themes (or districts) of Bulgaria and Paristrion A special tax, levied to finance the Emperor's marriage to Margaret of Hungary had brought the Bulgarian and Vlach population to the edge of an uprising before the public humiliation of Asen and his brother at the imperial camp. In spite of the general discontent, the brothers were initially unable to stir up a rebellion, because their compatriots did not believe they had any chance against the imperial troops. Theodor and Asen took advantage of the sack of Thessaloniki by the Normans, during which icons of Demetrius of Thessaloniki, the patron saint of the town, were taken to Bulgaria. They built a \\"house of prayer\\"O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (5.1.371), p. 205. and summoned Bulgarian and Vlach shamans to the site. The brothers instructed these \\"demoniacs\\", as Choniates called them, to declare before the mob that God \\"had consented to their freedom\\" and Saint Demetrius would \\"come over to them\\" from Thessaloniki \\"to be their helper and assistant\\" against the Byzantines. Theodor was crowned and assumed the name Peter, thus adopting the name of a 10th-century tsar (or emperor) of Bulgaria. The coronation and Theodor's new name are evidence the brothers wanted to demonstrate from the beginning they had established a state which was the political successor of the First Bulgarian Empire. They laid siege to Preslav, the old capital of the Bulgarian Empire but could not capture it. During the first months of 1186, the brothers made plundering raids against Thrace, seizing captives and cattle. Isaac II led a counteroffensive against the rebels in person, but they resisted the invaders hiding in \\"inaccessible places\\"O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (5.1.372), p. 205. in the mountains. It was only the solar eclipse of 21 April 1186 that enabled the imperial troops to mount an unexpected attack and defeat the rioters. Peter and Asen fled from their homeland and crossed the Lower Danube, seeking military assistance from the Cumans. Isaac II thought his victory was decisive and returned to Constantinople without securing the defense of Paristrion. Peter and Asen made an alliance with some Cuman chieftains who helped them to return to the Byzantine Empire in the autumn. Choniates wrote contradictory reports about the negotiations between the brothers and the Cumans. In a formal speech, he attributed the alliance to Peter's efforts; in his chronicle, he emphasized Asen's role. Shortly after their return, the brothers took control of Paristrion and launched a plundering expedition against Thrace. Asen's military tactics‚Äîthe application of sudden raids and quick withdrawals‚Äîprevented the imperial troops from making successful counterattacks. Choniates emphasized the brothers were not simply content to seize Mysia (or Paristrion) but had decided to \\"unite the political power of Mysia and Bulgaria into one empire as of old\\",O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (5.1.374), p. 206. referring to their attempt to restore the First Bulgarian Empire. = Co-ruler = Second Bulgarian Empire from 1185 to 1196, according to a Bulgarian historical atlas. The theory that Bulgaria included Oltenia and Muntenia, as it is presented on the map, is not universally accepted by historians. Seals bearing the inscription Ivan \\"basileus\\" (or emperor) of the Bulgarians were found in Constantinople and other places. According to George Akropolites, \\"Asen ruled over the Bulgarian race as emperor for nine years\\" before he died in 1196.George Akropolites: The History (ch. 12.), p. 137. This suggests Asen became his brother's co-ruler in 1187 or 1188. The Byzantines launched a series of unsuccessful campaigns against the rebellious Bulgarians and Vlachs, but they could not prevent Peter and Asen from securing their rule in Paristrion. Isaac II personally led his troops against the brothers' realm and laid siege to Lovech in the spring of 1188. Although he could not occupy the fortress, the Byzantines captured Asen's wife, Helen, and his younger brother, Kaloyan. He was held hostage in Constantinople for years. The arrival of the crusader army of the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, in the Balkan Peninsula in July 1189 enabled Peter and Asen to occupy new territories of the Byzantine Empire. One of the chronicles of Barbarossa's crusade, The History of the Expedition of the Emperor Frederick, explicitly mentions that they seized \\"the region where the Danube flows into the sea\\"The History of the Expedition of the Emperor Frederick, p. 64. (present-day Dobruja) and parts of Thrace. When writing of the negotiations between Barbarossa and the brothers' envoys during the march of the crusaders across the Balkans, primary sources mention only Peter, suggesting he was regarded as the senior ruler of Bulgaria. The crusaders left the Balkans for Asia Minor in March 1190. Shortly after the crusaders' departure, Isaac II Angelos moved into the lands under the rule of Peter and Asen. He could not defeat the Vlachs and Bulgarians, because they avoided a pitched battle, forcing the Emperor to start to retreat. The imperial army was ambushed and defeated at a mountain pass. The victorious Vlachs and Bulgarians, along with their Cuman allies, launched new raids against Thrace, pillaging Anchialos (now Pomorie in Bulgaria) and other towns. Isaac II defeated the Cumans near Adrianople (now Edirne in Turkey) in April 1191. Thereafter his cousin, Constantine Angelos Doukas, routed Peter and Asen's troops in a series of battles. A eulogy delivered in praise of Isaac II in 1193 referred to Asen as a \\"reckless and obdurate rebel\\", surrounded by \\"imperial traps\\", while describing Peter as a \\"stumbling block\\" and an \\"adverse wind\\" to his brother. The speech shows, Byzantine intrigues stirred up a conflict between the brothers in 1192. Madgearu says, Peter was allegedly willing to make peace with the Byzantines, but Asen wanted to continue the war. Akropolites knew that Peter moved from Tarnovo to Preslav at an unspecified date, a region known as \\"Peter's land\\" even in the 13th century. Historians Madgearu and Paul Stephenson agree, the sources provide evidence the brothers divided their realm around 1192, with Asen retaining Tarnovo and its region. After Constantine Angelos Doukas was blinded during the rebellion against Isaac II, the Vlachs and the Bulgarians resumed their attacks against the Byzantine Empire. The Emperor dispatched Alexios Gidos and Basil Vatatzes to wage war against the invaders, but their united armies were almost annihilated in the Battle of Arcadiopolis. Peter and Asen conquered new territories in Thrace, including Plovdiv. Isaac II decided to launch a new campaign to recover Thrace himself. While he was mustering his troops at Kypsela, his brother, Alexios, captured and blinded him on 8 April 1195. Alexios III sent envoys to Peter and Asen, proposing to make peace with them. The brothers refused the new emperor's proposal. Asen moved into Byzantine territory and defeated Alexios Aspietes. He captured the Byzantine fortresses along the River Struma leaving Vlach and Bulgarian troops to garrison them. A new Byzantine army, under the command of the Emperor's son-in-law, Isaac Komnenos, launched a counterinvasion. Asen's Vlach, Bulgarian and Cuman troops surrounded the invaders and defeated them near Serres. Komnenos was captured by a Cuman warrior who secretly tried to hold him to ask for a huge ransom from the Emperor. When Asen was informed of Komnenos's capture, he ordered the Cuman to hand over his captive. = Death = A boyar Ivanko stabbed Asen in 1196, but the motive for this act is uncertain. Choniates, who narrated the events, recorded two versions. According to one account, the captive Isaac Komnenos persuaded Ivanko to kill the Tsar, promising to give his daughter in marriage to him. The second version claims, Ivanko had \\"clandestine sexual relations with the sister of Asen's wife\\",O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (6.1.469), p. 257. but their affair was revealed to Asen. He decided to have his sister-in-law executed for the illicit love affair which insulted his family, but his wife persuaded him to punish Ivanko instead of her sister. Asen ordered Ivanko to come to his tent late at night. Ivanko who had been informed about the tsar's decision came with a sword hidden under his garments. He killed Asen during the meeting. Choniates stated, Ivanko wanted to rule \\"more justly and equitably\\" than Asan who had \\"governed everything by the sword\\".O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (6.1.470), p. 258. Stephenson concludes, Choniates' words show that Asen had introduced a \\"reign of terror\\", intimidating his subjects with the assistance of Cuman mercenaries. V√°s√°ry, however, says the Byzantines encouraged Ivanko to kill Asen. Ivanko attempted to assume control in Tarnovo with Byzantine support, but Peter forced him to flee to the Byzantine Empire. Peter charged Kaloyan with the governing of Asen's realm. Family Asen fathered at least two sons, Ivan Asen and Alexander. Ivan Asen, who was born around 1193, became the emperor of Bulgaria in 1218. His younger brother, Alexander, bore the title sebastokrator during Ivan Asen II's reign.

Transit network located on Wellington Street East between Yonge Street and Bayview Avenue in Aurora, Ontario, Canada. It is a stop on the Barrie line train service, and connects with York Region Transit local bus routes, and the GO Express Bus between Newmarket Bus Terminal and Union Station Bus Terminal. History Commemorative locomotive bell at the station. Aurora station opened on 16 May 1853, when steam train service began between Toronto and Machell's Corners, as Aurora was then known, on the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway. The first train was led by the Toronto, the first locomotive built in Canada, completed at the James Good foundry Toronto Locomotive Works on 16 April 1853. The train consist included two boxcars carrying freight, one passenger coach car, and one mixed passenger and baggage car. This first voyage is commemorated by a plaque installed in 1953 at Union Station in Toronto, as well as a steam locomotive bell placed first at Centennial Park in May 1963, which has since been relocated to Aurora station. There is also a plaque placed in a small parkette at the station by the Board of Trade and another placed by the Province of Ontario to remember the event. The train's arrival at the Wellington Street train station was greeted with cheers from nearly all residents of the community, who had assembled at the station, and the event was celebrated with a fireworks display. Connection to the railway led to prosperity for Aurora, with the development of two hotels, a wagon maker, a brewery, and other businesses. In 1855 the line was completed to Collingwood. In 1900, Grand Trunk Railway constructed the present building to a standard plan design with a porte-coch√®re and low profile. The building was designated a provincial heritage building in 1971 and a federal heritage railway station in 1990. The station building was renovated after GO Transit became the exclusive passenger carrier in 1992.

History This station was opened in January 2001 to accommodate the growing ridership on the Barrie line along with the growing communities surrounding Rutherford GO Station. Another reason for the station's presence was due to Maple GO Station's parking congestion prior to Rutherford's opening. In May 2017, Metrolinx issued a request for qualification (RFQ) for the redevelopment of the station. The proposal requires infrastructure upgrades at the station, including the addition of a second rail track, new rail platforms with a full canopy, and grade separation of the rail intersection with Rutherford Road. A new station building will be constructed that will integrate a multi-level parking structure. In November 2017 Infrastructure Ontario issued a request for proposal from EllisDon Infrastructure Transit, Link Rutherford Station, and Steelhead, the three candidates shortlisted from the RFQ process, for the design, construction, and maintenance of the site. In December 2018, the contract for the project was awarded to EllisDon Infrastructure Transit and it was announced that construction on the project would start the next spring and finish in 2023.

It is 67 km north of Union Station in downtown Toronto, and was the terminus of the Bradford line before it was extended to Barrie and renamed the Barrie line on December 17, 2007. History Bradford has had railway service since 1853, when the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway was extended there from Machell's Corners (now known as Aurora). This would evolve into the Northern Railway of Canada, which was later acquired by the Grand Trunk Railway. It eventually became a part of the Canadian National Railway system in 1923. In 1972, a Barrie commuter service to Toronto was established by CN Rail at the request of the Canadian Transportation Commission, which passed through Bradford. When CN Rail's passenger operations were transferred to the newly-formed Via Rail in 1978, the Barrie commuter line became a Via operation. This would be short- lived, however, as federal government budget cuts in 1981 eliminated 20% of Via Rail's network, including a number of commuter lines around Toronto, such as the Barrie line. After a significant public pressure campaign from transit activists and local municipalities along the line, the service was preserved and transferred from Via Rail to GO Transit. GO train service began on 7 September 1982, with Bradford as the terminal station, with GO bus service connecting riders from Barrie to Bradford. initial service was a single weekday round trip. From 1990 to 1993, Barrie succeeded Bradford as the terminal station on the line, before Ontario provincial government cuts caused the service to Barrie to end, with Bradford becoming the terminal station once again. Throughout the following years, train frequency along the line was gradually increased, with two trains a day starting in 1998. In 2007, service was finally extended north of Bradford once again, with Metrolinx's purchase of the CN Newmarket Subdivision. By the summer of 2012, five trains were running every weekday, and weekend and holiday train service was introduced for the summer. In December 2018, the Town of Bradford West Gwillimbury voted to sell a vacant parcel of land north of the station to Metrolinx so that additional station parking could be constructed. Services Bradford station has weekday train service consisting of 10 trains southbound to Union Station in the morning, 9 trains returning northbound in the afternoon and evening, and one train returning northbound at midnight.

Along with the other members of The Lox, he is a founder of D-Block Records and is also a part of the Ruff Ryders. In addition to his group work he has released multiple albums and mixtapes as a solo MC. In 2002 he released his debut solo album A Gangster and a Gentleman, which contained the hit single \\"Good Times\\". The song peaked at number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and received massive nationwide airplay in 2002. He has gone on to release Time is Money (2006), Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman) (2007), Master of Ceremonies (2011), The World's Most Hardest MC Project (2012), Float (2013), Phantom and the Ghost (2014), A Wise Guy and a Wise Guy (2015), and G-Host (2018).  Early life  David Styles was born November 28, 1974 in Corona, Queens to a South African mother and a Jamaican father from Bed-Stuy. After his parents' divorce, Styles and his younger brother Gary moved to Yonkers with their mother. It was there he met lifelong friends Jadakiss and Sheek Louch. The trio bonded over their shared passion for hip hop and eventually formed a group known as The Lox in 1994. Musical career =1994 ‚Äì 2000: The Lox= Styles P (left) performing with Jadakiss As a trio, The Lox began rapping in the mid-1990s and started to build a steady underground following thanks to their performances and street freestyles. In their late teens, the trio met Mary J. Blige who was impressed with their lyrical content, and gave their demo to Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs. Diddy immediately hired the trio to write for Bad Boy Records. After signing with Bad Boy, the Lox quickly started collaborating on hits with Diddy, The Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige and Mariah Carey which gave them instant notoriety and status within the hip-hop and mainstream charts. In 1996 and 1997, the group wrote and performed on a number of Diddy hits, including \\"It's All About the Benjamins\\" and \\"I Got the Power\\", Mase's \\"24 Hrs. to Live\\", Mariah Carey's \\"Honey\\", the Notorious B.I.G.'s \\"Last Day\\" and Mary J. Blige's \\"Can‚Äôt Get You Off My Mind\\". In 1997, the Lox received international acclaim when their tribute to the late Biggie Smalls, \\"We‚Äôll Always Love Big Poppa\\", was picked as the B-side track from Diddy‚Äôs No Way Out album (3x Platinum) with the number one hit, \\"I'll Be Missing You\\". This single was the most played hit in 1997, which opened the door for the Lox‚Äôs to write more of their own songs and eventually release their first album in January 1998 titled Money, Power & Respect. The album went on to be certified platinum, and, although the album was a chart-topping success, the group grew to feel that the glossy image and production style of Bad Boy Records conflicted with their grimier rap aesthetic. After trying and failing to get Puff Daddy to grant them a release from their contract, the group confronted him in his office, with Styles P throwing a chair at his own boss. After this, the group was granted their release and left Bad Boy to sign with Ruff Ryder Records. = 2000‚Äì07: Ruff Ryder's and solo albums = After releasing another Lox album, We Are the Streets and appearing on albums with other Ruff Ryders artists, Styles released his first solo album, A Gangster and a Gentleman, in 2002.

His devotees consider him to have been a great spiritual master and have testified to miraculous feats he supposedly accomplished. Rol was born in Turin, Italy, and graduated in law at the University of Turin, Faculty of Law in 1933. He also studied in London and Paris and began a banking career that took him to other major European cities. While in Marseille during 1925-1926, he encountered a person who showed him some card tricks, triggering an interest in magical and paranormal phenomena. He pursued deeper spiritual studies and had an experience in Paris of which he wrote in his diary: \\"I discovered a tremendous law that links the color green, the musical fifth, and heat. I have lost my will to live. I am frightened by power. I shall write no more!\\" As a result of this crisis, he briefly retreated to a convent. Upon returning to Italy, in the 1930s he became known in aristocratic and political circles. Rol engaged in various demonstrations of his supposed mystical powers, including telepathy, clairvoyance, and other psychic or magical feats. He also became a friend, among others, of film directors Federico Fellini and Franco Zeffirelli and writer Dino Buzzati. Toward the later part of his life, and after his death, Rol was a focal point of debate in Italy between skeptics and advocates of parapsychology. His supposed mystical powers were never demonstrated, and he repeatedly refused to be controlled by any illusionist. He was, and then he was not.

The bridge was part of the Lincoln Highway until 1920 (when the highway was moved to the free Lower Trenton Bridge), and was later connected to Brunswick Circle by the Calhoun Street Extension as part of a bypass of downtown Trenton. Prior to 1940, trolleys of the Trenton-Princeton Traction Company, utilized this bridge to cross into Pennsylvania.

He received a PhD in Economics from the University of Michigan in 1979.CV Career In his 1989 book More Heat than Light, Mirowski reveals a history of how physics has drawn inspiration from economics and how economics has sought to emulate physics, especially with regard to the theory of value. He traces the development of the energy concept in Western physics and its subsequent effect on the invention and promulgation of neoclassical economics, the modern orthodox theory. Machine Dreams explores the historical influences of the military and the cyborg sciences on neoclassical economics. The neglected influence of John von Neumann and his theory of automata are key themes throughout the book. Mirowski claims that many of the developments in neoclassical economics in the 20th century, from game theory to computational economics, are the unacknowledged result of von Neumann's plans for economics. The work expands Mirowski's vision for a computational economics, one in which various market types are constructed in a similar fashion to Noam Chomsky's generative grammar. The role of economics is to explore how various market types perform in measures of complexity and efficiency, with more complicated markets being able to incorporate the effects of the less complex. By complexity Mirowski means something analogous to computational complexity theory in computer science. Mirowski's criticism of game theory is noted by Peter L. Bernstein. In his book Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste, Mirowski concludes that neoliberal thought has become so pervasive that any countervailing evidence serves only to further convince disciples of its ultimate truth. Once neoliberalism became a Theory of Everything, providing a revolutionary account of self, knowledge, information, markets, and government, it could no longer be falsified by anything as trifling as data from the \\"real\\" economy.

They were very popular in Finland, Sweden and Estonia in the 1970s and early 1980s, as well as a popular live act in Sweden during this time. Their classic line- up consisted of Remu Aaltonen, Albert J√§rvinen, and Cisse H√§kkinen. The misspelling of the name (\\"Hurriganes\\" with a \\"g\\") is intentional. Their style of music is very much of a nostalgic, pre-Beatles, roots rock'n'roll orientation. During their \\"classic\\" period, the band's output consisted largely of revved-up cover versions of well-known 1950s rock 'n' roll songs, in addition to their own original material. In this sense, Hurriganes can be viewed as Finland's answer to British pub rock performers of the 1970s like Dave Edmunds and Dr. Feelgood. The founding members were drummer and vocalist Henry \\"Remu\\" Aaltonen, bassist Hugo Christer \\"Cisse\\" H√§kkinen and guitarist Ilkka \\"Ile\\" Kallio. Kallio temporarily quit the band in the spring of 1972, being replaced by guitarist Pekka \\"Albert\\" J√§rvinen who was part of the band's most famous line-up. Career =Early years= Hurriganes was founded in 1971 in Pohjois-Haaga, Helsinki, where a similar rock band Jig-Saw played. Influenced by the name of the North American band Johnny And The Hurricanes, Remu Aaltonen devised the name for his own band. Hurriganes practiced in a garage in Ohjaajantie. =Rock and Roll All Night Long (1972‚Äì73)= Hurriganes' first album Rock and Roll All Night Long was released in 1973. It included songs such as \\"Say Mama\\" and \\"Keep On Knocking\\". The album's A-side was recorded in a concert in Klaukkala, as was the first song of the B-side, but the rest was recorded in the studio. The album became the first gold record album for the record label Love Records. =Roadrunner (1974)= Hurriganes' commercial high point was with the release of Roadrunner in 1974. The album included the band's most famous song \\"Get On\\", which won the International European Pop Jury competition. The album also included the songs \\"Roadrunner,\\" \\"It Ain't What You Do\\", \\"I Will Stay\\" and \\"The Phone Rang\\". Roadrunner was recorded in Stockholm at Marcus Music Studios, and the album was also mastered in Stockholm. Roadrunner is still considered one of Finnish rock music's most important albums, and it is Finland's seventh-best-selling album of all time. It was Finland's best-selling album by a Finnish band from 1974 until 1985, when Dingo's Kerj√§l√§isten valtakunta exceeded the volume of sales. The album's cover art (by Risto Vuorimies) was the only Finnish album cover in a 1977 book Album Cover Album (Dragons, World Book) which was compiled by Hipgnosis and Roger Dean. The cover's stylish motif was chosen by Hurriganes' bassist Cisse H√§kkinen, who owned a light blue 1954 Cadillac Series 62 sedan. The cover shows Remu Aaltonen, Cisse H√§kkinen and Albert J√§rvinen sitting on the back seat of the Cadillac. In 2007, Roadrunner was re- released as a SACD mixed to a 5.1 format. =Crazy Days: Kallio returns (1975)= J√§rvinen left the band in the summer of 1975, and Ile Kallio returned to the band after a break of three years. After Roadrunner, the band's popularity was at its highest, and not until the late 1970s did new wave and rockabilly genres succeed in prying Hurriganes from their spot as number one on the Finnish band scene, although in Hurriganes' early career Hullujussi also momentarily stole some acclaim. In the neighboring country of Sweden, the band was a popular live performer well into the 1980s, and broke the concert venue Folkpark's record in audience numbers several times. The same in 1975, when Hurriganes released the album Crazy Days, which reached diamond disc status quickly, but never did beat the Roadrunner album in terms of sales. Crazy Days contained one major hit, originally released by Jim & The Beatmakers in 1964: \\"My Only One\\", which had long been on Hurriganes's concert repertoire, a song sung by Cisse in a bravura performance until the end. The album also covered the Lennon-McCartney composition \\"Bad to Me\\". =Hot Wheels (1976)= After Crazy Days, Hot Wheelss sound was rawer and heavier than its predecessor. This album differs from its predecessors in that it contains only Remu's and Cisse's names in the writing credits of the band's own songs. Ile also took part in the songwriting but Remu deliberately left his name out of the credits. The album was recorded in Lahti by Pekka Nurmi at Microvox studio, which was a cheap, seedy, and not very classy basement studio. In Sweden, Hot Wheels was a real breakthrough and is considered at least equal in importance to Roadrunner. Familiar songs from the album, such as the title track, \\"Hot Wheels\\", was heard in 1976-produced, low-budget film Hot Guys, Hot Wheels. The film does not have any particular plot, but it portrays a boy and a girl who end up on a date at a Hurriganes concert. It also shows Remu, Cisse and Ile jamming and spending their free time, including playing football. The movie was directed by Jussi Itkonen, and it aptly describes life in the 1970s. Hurriganes members played themselves in the movie. =Tsugu Way and Hanger (1977‚Äì78)= Hurriganes recorded the album Tsugu Way (1977) in Love Records' brand new studio, and there were some technical problems, but the content was familiar Hurriganes with some covers, like the Beatles' \\"Hold Me Tight\\". The album was released in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands with the name of \\"Use No Hooks\\". The album sold well enough to become a Gold Record easily, even though the record sales were generally down in Finland due to a recession. In November 1977, Hurriganes' Swedish Sonet label arranged a small tour for the band in London. It was also agreed that next summer they would play 30 gigs in Europe as Status Quo's opening act. Hurriganes failed to conquer London, however, and also the Quo gigs were canceled when Remu and Cisse quit the tour and went back to Finland. The reason was apparently the fact that the band was unknown in England, and the tour arrangements and the reception reflected that. For example, they were not headlining their most important gigs. Remu states, \\"I fucked up to the whole system so we went away\\". For the time being, Ile Kallio's last Hurriganes album was Hanger, where the drummer Beaver Aittoj√§rvi-Oja performed, and keyboardist Jim Pembroke. Remu's back problems prevented him from playing, and the short-lived five piece Hurriganes went on tour to Sweden, but the reception was a little contradictory. The drummer in the concerts was Tomi Parkkonen. =Kallio changed again to J√§rvinen (1979‚Äì1981)= After the band had failed to find success in Britain in 1977, Ile Kallio began to lose interest and eventually was replaced by Albert J√§rvinen in early 1979. Kallio's last recording with the band was the single Shorai Shorai which was not published until after Kallio's departure from the band. J√§rvinen's second stint with the band lasted two albums ‚Äì Jailbird (1979) and 10/80 (1980), the latter of which was a major critical and commercial success, and included the song \\"Bourbon Street\\". The album was recorded in Stockholm, ABBA's Polar studios, and it was produced by Pave Maijanen. The album's first track \\"Made in Sweden\\", which J√§rvinen and Aaltonen's earlier band Kalevala had already played, and the last song \\"Just For You\\" are unusual for Hurriganes instrumentals. =Louhivuori the new guitarist (1981‚Äì83)= J√§rvinen was dropped from the band in September 1981, due to alcohol-related unreliability.Hurriganes 2002, pp. 262‚Äì266. He was replaced by the renowned studio musician Janne Louhivuori. Louhivuori played on two Hurriganes albums ‚Äì 1981's Fortissimo, and the following year's Rockin' Hurriganes. Both albums sold quite well, and Hurriganes continued to be a big concert draw.Hurriganes 2002, pp. 274, 284‚Äì285. =Kallio's third stint (1983‚Äì84)= Louhivuori left the band in the summer of 1983, and his replacement was Ile Kallio, who played on the band's last studio recordings, the album Seven Days, Seven Nights (1983) and the mini-album Hurrygames (1984). The latter was accompanied by a video release with the same name.Hurriganes 2002, pp. 304‚Äì305. The band broke up soon after that.Hurriganes 2002, p. 304. =The comeback in 1988= Hurriganes reunited in 1988 with the lineup of Aaltonen, H√§kkinen and J√§rvinen, and the band played a series of live shows in the summer. After only a few concerts, however, J√§rvinen was replaced once again by Janne Louhivuori, who played guitar on the remaining shows.Albert J√§rvinen 2010, pp. 330‚Äì331. The last concerts were recorded, and the live album Live at Metropol was released. The band broke up after the live album had been compiled.Hurriganes 2002, pp. 320‚Äì324. =H√§kkinen, J√§rvinen in memoriam= Bassist Cisse H√§kkinen died of alcohol-related illnesses on Boxing Day in 1990. In March of the following year, guitarist Albert J√§rvinen died of heart failure in London.Albert J√§rvinen 2010, pp. 413‚Äì417. After their deaths, Remu Aaltonen has continued to play Hurriganes' music with many leading Finnish musicians. =Live In Stockholm (1996)= In 1996, the band released a live album Live In Stockholm 1977. The concert had been recorded on a cassette tape which guitarist Ile Kallio found years later during a move. The album quickly became a gold album in Finland. It had been recorded in the band's Swedish breakthrough concert in theater Jarla. Two concerts were held that night, because the first one had sold out right away. =New Hurriganes since 1998= Remu Aaltonen re- introduced the Hurriganes name in 1998 as Remu & Hurriganes. Old members (Ile Kallio, Janne Louhivuori) weren't part of the new line-up, and instead two new members joined the band. They were Harry Merilahti (bass and vocals), and his son, Rocka Merilahti (guitar). In 2001 the trio released an album called 30th Anniversary, which included new versions of old hits and one new song. The composition of the band changed many times, and its members included guitarist Jukka Orma, bassist Mikko L√∂ytty, guitarist Nipa Niilola, guitarist Juho Pitk√§nen, and bassist Hike K√§rpp√§, among others. In 2007, the biopic Ganes was released. It was directed by JP Siili. Remu Aaltonen was involved in the making of the film. Music and stage presence Hurriganes gained fame from the beginning of a wild and energetic stage presence, of a kind not previously experienced in Finland. The band's music was straightforward rock and roll. The band's repertoire included a number of versions of originality in 1950 ‚Äì and the 1960s rock classics, including Little Richard's \\"Slippin' and Slidin'\\" and Bo Diddley's \\"Roadrunner\\". Stage presence, dress like a playing, everything came full force and enthusiasm. Remu Aaltonen, who replied Cisse H√§kkinen style, and made him a 1950s rocker style, sitting in full. Hurriganes members of the popular clothing included: Beavers-brand jeans and denim jackets, leather jackets and boots. Hurriganes impact on Finnish rock music Hurriganes is considered to be the first Finnish rock band who also gained commercial success overseas. Many of the later Finnish rock bands acknowledge Hurriganes as Finland's great pioneer in the genre. These include, for example, Hanoi Rocks. Hanoi Rocks guitarist Andy McCoy has said that the 1970s and 1980s had only two real Finnish rock bands: Hurriganes and Hanoi Rocks.

It is the headquarter of the Punalur Taluk and Punalur Revenue Division. It's situated in the eastern part of Kollam district of the southern Indian state of Kerala, on the banks of the Kallada River and foothills of the western ghats. It is about north-east of Kollam and north of Thiruvananthapuram.Punalur is also Known as Mini Pamba, Lap of the Western Ghat, and Gateway of Sabarimala. It is the second-largest city in Kollam District after Kollam and is also one of the biggest and oldest Municipal towns in Kerala, home to a paper industry with the Punalur Paper Mills, established in the 1850s, one of the first industries in Kerala and a pioneer in the industrial revolution of the state. Punalur is also known as the \\"Pepper City of Kerala\\". Punalur became an important trading and transport center between Kollam and Tirunelveli (Tamil Nadu) under the rule of the Travancore Kingdom. Steady progress by the Punalur Panchayat administration saw an upgrade to municipality status in 1971 April 1.  Etymology  It is believed that Punalur derived its name by the word 'Punal' (river in old Tamil and Malayalam as in \\"kuruthipunal=river of blood\\" according to Dr. Hermann Gundert), and \\"Ooru\\" (place), referring to the river passing through the City.  History  Punalur is a Municipal town on a mountain path that had good relations with Tamil Nadu to the East from time unknown. Most parts of Punalur taluk were inhabited before the Indus Valley Civilization. Human civilizations existed in Punalur during the Mesolithic period, mainly around Thenmalai (known as Shenduruny). Punalur is described in inscriptions of Mithranandpuram and Vellayani. Until 1734, Punalur was under the direct rule of the Ilaydathu Swaroopam. Later it was annexed by Marthanda Varma and came under the rule of Travancore. The British Raj established a good hold over this part of India due to its rich agricultural resources. Historically, Shenduruny has a rich heritage. A recent study conducted by Dr. P. RajendranStudy conducted by Dr. Rajendran Archaeological wonders discovered by Dr. P. Rajendran G. Asokan at different sites in Kerala], archaeological research associate of the Poona Deccan College, has resulted in the excavation of the remains of Stone Age culture from a large cave situated at the north western part of the Shenduruny (Kallada) River. It was proved that these remains belong to the Mesolithic period. This study brought out the fact that the Shenduruny River Valley Civilization was one of the oldest river valley civilizations in India. It dates to between 5210 and 4420 BC, making it older than the Indus Valley Civilization which is believed to have flourished from 4400 to 3700 BC. Cave paintings seen here are comparable to the Mesolithic paintings found in the caves of central India. The cave found here is large enough to hold at least twenty people at a time. According to Dr. Rajendran, the marshy place seen below just in front of the cave once must have been a lake. Now the Shenduruny River has the reputation that it had nourished a civilization in the prehistoric past. Punalur also served as a pivot point in the rise of the independence movement and against the rule of Diwan. Many meetings were centered on Punalur due to its close proximity to Tamil Nadu. Many important decisions on planning and attacking Tirunelveli collector were taken in Punalur. The Taluk headquarters was shifted from Pathanapuram to Punalur, after an attack at Pathanapuram in 1880. This helped aid the growth of Punalur. Later the flow of goods to and from Tamil Nadu started traveling through Punalur. Punalur is the first settlement after the Western ghats. The opening of the Punalur Suspension Bridge increased the importance of Punalur as a center of trade between Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Later the rail route between Kollam and Thiruchendur made the town more prosperous. Punalur Paper Mills, the first of its kind in Kerala, served both as an economic center as well as a source of jobs. The Punalur paper mill employees' union was one of the first organised employee unions in the state of Kerala itself. The workers of Punalur paper mill actively participated in movements including the freedom fight and the riot against Diwan rule. Later the Travancore plywood industry added to Punalur's importance in the industrial field. Punalur Market (formerly Sri Ramapuram market) is one of the largest vegetable/agro-products markets in Kerala. The cultural history of Punalur reflects in the work of traditional and modern artists and performing groups of music, drama, cinema, etc., especially acclaimed contributions of Punalur N. Rajagopalan Nair, Punalur Balan and Lalithambika Antharjanam in theatre and Malayalam literature.

A proposal for this Hospital to upgraded as a General Hospital/District Specialty Hospital. The Punalur Taluk Hospital has set a benchmark in public sector healthcare to get a new hi-tech building under Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The building will have 32 outpatient units functioning at the same time, which is first of its kind in a taluk hospital. INKEL will construct the 12-storey Rs 68-crore building having a total area of 2,00,000 sq feet under the ‚ÄòAardram‚Äô mission. The new facility will have 500 beds for inpatients, 94 ICU beds and seven lifts. \\"The hospital will compete with any of the corporate hospitals in the state, with 32 doctors available at a time attend outpatients in the new building.\\" The hospital had bagged awards from Kerala State Pollution Control Board for the last six consecutive years of which three are excellence awards. The hospital already has employed 40 advanced cosmetology procedures including skin platelet-rich plasma administration, follicle transplantation, squint correction, and dental jewellery. The programme ‚ÄòBeside you ‚Äì birth companion scheme‚Äô permits husband or female relative of pregnant women to be present in the labor room at the time of delivery. The hospital is also the first to employ a painless delivery facility in a public sector hospital in the state. The hospital has centralised systems for air, oxygen, and suction in all beds, probably the lone facility in public health centres. Dialysis and cancer care services are free. Palliative care also functions at the hospital, which receives over 2,000 outpatients per day a number a private hospital under normal circumstances used to have. ESI Hospital, Government Taluk Ayurveda and Homeo Hospitals also Major private Hospitals functioning in Punalur.  Climate  Even though it is located near the Western Ghats, Punalur is the hottest place in Kerala, and during summer temperatures as high as have been recorded. One of Kerala's weather stations in Punalur and Chittur, Palakkad had a long reputation of being the hottest places in Kerala, but Punalur broke all heat records in 2007 and 2009. The summers of 2007 and 2009 were the hottest when the maximum temperature hovered around for many days. Punalur also holds the record for the coldest temperature ever recorded in lowland/midland regions of Kerala; with on 8 January 1968. Minimum temperatures in January‚ÄìFebruary on a cloudless day can be as low as and maximum in March‚ÄìApril can be as high as . Because of this, Punalur is also known as \\"The Hot City Of Kerala\\". thumb  right  alt= This bridge was built by Britisher's for the Kingdom of Travancore in which the people can have ease of transportation at early times of 1900  Photo of the article  Punalur Suspension Bridge  The Punalur Suspension Bridge is the oldest motorable bridge in Kerala, which was built by the British on AD 1877 and is now a historical attraction. It is also known as \\"London Bridge Of Kerala\\". The bridge has a length of 400 feet. The suspension bridge was built to prevent wild animals from crossing into the town from the forest area of old Kattupathanapuram. It is the symbol of Punalur now. It is added to Kerala Tourism Circuit recently. Punalur is also known as the \\" Hanging bridge City Of Kerala \\"  Punalur Paper Mill  It is believed that the oldest paper mill in the country was started at Punalur in 1886. It was Moolam Thirunal who gave permission for starting a paper mill to a British industrialist T.J. Camerron using the abundantly growing reeds in the surrounding dense forest as raw material. The paper mill was initially christened the Travancore Paper Mills. The name changed to Lakshmi Paper Mills, then to Meenakshi Paper Mills and finally Punalur Paper Mills in 1931 as managements changed. The mill boasted the India Security Press at Nasik among its clientele at that time. In 1987, the mill which was managed by L.N. Dalmia and had around 1020 employees was shut down due to huge liabilities.  Transportation  = Major roads = Punalur Ksrtc bus stand Kollam ‚Äì Thirumangalam Road (NH-744) passes through Punalur, connects the City to Tamil Nadu and other parts of the districts.

It is also known as the Gateway of Sabarimala. Station Manager's office, Railway Protection Force (RPF) Station, Assistant divisional Electrical Engineer's Office, Southern Railway Sectional Engineer office, and Track Machine Maintenance section also functioning in Punalur Railway Station. The construction of the meter gauge rail route between Kollam ‚Äì Punalur and Punalur ‚Äì Sengottai (Ghats Section) along the scenic mountain terrain was started in 1873 by the British engineers and was completed in 1902. Travancore rulers in association with the British prepared the plan for the track through the challenging mountain terrain as it involved the construction of long arch bridges over steep valleys and tunnels across the rocky mountains of Western Ghats. thumb The first goods train travelled on this route in 1902 and a train carrying its first passengers began its run in 1904. It makes for a thrilling train journey as it passes over five big bridges and hundreds of tiny ones while negotiating mountain streams and valleys. Passengers are also treated to a breath-taking view of the Western Ghats. The train also passes through five tunnels on this stretch, including the one-kilometre-long tunnel between Bhagawathipuram and Arayankavu. The station at Punalur is equipped with the locomotive service centre, parcel and timber depot, train parking bays, storage tanks for water and oil, etc. This route is in the process of up- gradation to broad-gauge and the first part of conversion finished between Kollam and Punalur. The second part of conversion work on Punalur-Sengottai ghat section also finished and starts passenger and goods services. Now this will serve as the shortest rail-route from Kochi port to Tuticorin port. The infrastructure of the station will be changed as proposed in tune with handling demands and historical accuracy. The Punalur Railway Station currently connects to Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram, Chengannur, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad Junction, Nagarcoil, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Madurai, Thiruchirappally, Chennai and Velankanni. The station handles six express train services to Velankanni, Chennai Egmore, Ernakulam, Kollam Junction, Thirunelveli, Palakkad Junction and eight passenger train services, of which four services ply to Kollam Junction, another four services ply to Sengottai, Madurai Junction, Guruvayur and Kanyakumari.  Economy  The main agricultural products of this City include rubber, black pepper, and other spices. Punalur Sreeramavarmapuram Market is one of the largest vegetable market in Kerala. The chief commodities of export here are the hill products: pineapple, pepper products, plywood and timber. The Punalur Paper Mill Ltd., a paper industry established in 1888 by a German national, was closed in 1987 due to labour disputes. Various attempts to resolve the issues over two decades failed to produce any result but finally reached a legal settlement in February 2011 between the new management and the State Government. It is in the process of running by the newly formed management. A major share of PPM is owned by Akhula Industries, Hyderabad. The Punalur economy was at its height during the time of Punalur Paper Mill. However, other industries like Agro- Fruit, State Farming Corporation, Rehabilitation Plantations, RPC Kraft Paper, plywood industry, etc. still provide a significant contribution to Kerala. The Punalur market is also assisted by the agricultural industries.  Demographics  India census, Punalur had a population of 66,702. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%.

His dissertation covering the reflection and diffraction of light in crystals was completed in 1887, under Woldemar Voigt. Career In 1894 Drude became an extraordinarius professor at the University of Leipzig; in the same year he married Emilie Regelsberger, daughter of a G√∂ttingen lawyer. They had four children. In 1900, he became the editor for the scientific journal Annalen der Physik, the most respected physics journal at that time. From 1901-1905, he was ordinarius professor of physics at Giessen University. In 1905 he became the director of the physics institute of the University of Berlin. In 1906, at the height of his career, he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. A few days after his inauguration lecture, for inexplicable reasons, he committed suicide. Drude was survived by his wife and four children. =Work= Drude graduated the year Heinrich Hertz began publishing his findings from his experiments on the electromagnetic theories of James Clerk Maxwell. Thus Drude began his professional career at the time Maxwell's theories were being introduced into Germany.Jungnickel, 1990b, p. 167. His first experiments were the determination of the optical constants of various solids, measured to unprecedented levels of accuracy. He then worked to derive relationships between the optical and electrical constants and the physical structure of substances. In 1894 he was responsible for introducing the symbol \\"c\\" for the speed of light in a perfect vacuum. Toward the end of his tenure at Leipzig, Drude was invited to write a textbook on optics, which he accepted. The book, Lehrbuch der Optik,The book was translated into English by C. R. Mann and Robert Millikan and published in 1902, under the title The Theory of Optics. (Jungnickel, 1990b, p. 171.)

Along with Giuseppe Castiglione, Benoist served as one of two Jesuit advisors to the Qianlong Emperor, and transformed parts of the Old Summer Palace into what historian Mark Elliott calls an \\"imitation of Versailles or Fontainebleau.\\" Early life Michel Benoist was born on October 8, 1715 in Dijon, France. The name Benoist is an archaic form of the name \\"Beno√Æt,\\" and both are used interchangeably in textual sources. Benoist studied in Dijon and at Saint Sulpice, Paris. He entered the Jesuit Novitiate at Nancy on March 18, 1737, and was formally ordained as a Jesuit priest in Trier in 1739. Shortly after, he left for Paris to study mathematics, astronomy, and hydraulics under Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and Louis Guillaume Le Monnier, two members of the French Academy of Sciences. It was under their guidance that Benoist studied architecture, preparing for his work with the Qing court. Benoist was then sent to China on behalf of the Society of Jesus, arriving initially at Macao and finally to Beijing in 1744.  Jesuits and the Qianlong Emperor  When Michel Benoist arrived at the court of the Qianlong Emperor, the role of Jesuits had transformed. Although Jesuits were kept at the court since the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, their powers to proselytize in the Qing Empire were reduced dramatically. According to Jesuit scholar Jean Charbonnier, the imperial decree of 1724 was a drastic change for Catholic missionaries, enforcing draconian measures to limit the spread of Christianity. By the time of the ascent of the Qianlong Emperor, the role of Jesuit missionaries was reinvented. As Mark Elliot notes in his biography of the Qianlong Emperor, Jesuits were allowed to learn and document Manchu and Chinese languages and culture in return for their service to the Qianlong court as subjects. Like many Jesuits, Michel Benoist entered the court knowing it was unlikely for him to return to his homeland. Works Over the course of thirty years, Michel Benoist served the Qianlong Emperor on a number of construction projects and as an advisor on European affairs. The Qianlong Emperor revered Benoist as a source of intellect and a window into the ideas of the European Enlightenment. According to Joanna Waley-Cohen, the Qianlong Emperor and Benoist conversed over various topics such as \\"Western science, philosophy, warfare, cartography, shipping, and navigational practices,‚Äù accentuating the cosmopolitan interests of the Qianlong Emperor. Many of Benoist's accomplishments have been documented by two authors: Louis Pfister (1833 - 1891), and Alphose Favier (1837 - 1905), a Catholic Bishop based in Beijing. = Yuanming Yuan = During the second year of his reign in 1737, the Qianlong Emperor commissioned Giuseppe Castiglione to construct multiple European-style pavilions (Xiyanglou) on the grounds of the Old Summer Palace. Michel Benoist oversaw the construction of Castiglione's designs, taking over construction following Castiglione's death in 1766, and helped design multiple parts of the palace. His studies in hydraulics were used for designing various fountains throughout the palace. His greatest achievement was the construction of a \\"water clock\\" in front of The Hall of Calm Seas, a building arguably based on the Court of Honor at Versailles. The clock consisted of a fountain basin surrounded by 12 statues depicting the animals of the Chinese zodiac, with each zodiac associated with the 12 Chinese hours dictated by the Earthly Branches System. Using a hydraulic system designed by Benoist, each statue spewed water from the mouth of each animal for a consecutive hour, and was among the first water jet systems developed in China. An 18th century engraving depicting the water clock designed by Benoist featuring the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac in front of The Hall of Calm Seas (Haiyantang). = World Map = Benoist worked on numerous cartography projects for the Qianlong Emperor. His first cartography project was mapping out the territories of the Qing Empire and its borderlands, following up on previous work by Jesuits during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. Historian Mario Cams notes Benoist's maps visually incorporated distant territories such as Xinjiang into the boundaries and defined borderlands between Qing China, Mongolia, and Imperial Russia.Cams, Mario. 2017. Companions in Geography : East-West Collaboration in the Mapping of Qing China (C.1685-1735). East and West : Culture, Diplomacy and Interactions, Volume 1. Leiden: Brill. Benoist then produced a large world map on the walls of Yuanming Yuan. The map helped familiarize the Qianlong Emperor with the geography of Europe and his empire, and according to historian Mark Elliott prepared the Emperor for the later arrival of the British Macartney Embassy in 1793. = Astronomy = Because of his training in astronomy, Benoist helped establish European studies of astronomy to Qing China. Historian Nathan Sivin notes that Benoist was the first to introduce Copernican cosmology in China \\"after the church's ban on Copernican cosmology ended in 1757.\\" Benoist's presentation of Copernican theory stood in contrast from previous Jesuit advisors that either ignored Copernicus's ideas or contradicted one another. For instance, German Jesuit Schall von Bell previously argued that the planets and the sun moved in a circular motion, while Benoist argued the sun was a static body. Benoist, according to Sivin, was not only among the greatest champions of the Copernican model in China, but was also one of the last successful Jesuit scientists to do so. Benoist also instructed the Qianlong Emperor on use of the telescope for the observation of celestial bodies. = Other work = Benoist set up a printing shop to produce prints of historic battle scenes from a set of copper engravings which had been gifted from king Louis XV of France in 1772, and was the last of Benoist's contributions to the Qianlong Court.  Death  Michel Benoist died in Beijing, China on October 23, 1774, of a stroke. He died at 59 years old, shortly after learning of the formal suppression of the Society of Jesus in Europe. His body was interred at the Zhengfusi cemetery on the outskirts a Beijing. In his honor, the Qianlong Emperor funded his funeral with \\"one hundred pieces of silver.\\" Zhengfusi was one of two cemeteries dedicated to Jesuits in service in China. The first, Zhalan, was a cemetery built in 1611 that interned Jesuits such as Matteo Ricci, while Zhengfusi was built in 1732 for the French Jesuit community. Ruins of the north facade of Xieqiqu, one of the pavilions to feature the fountains constructed by Michel Benoist. The photograph was taken in 1873 by German photographer Ernst Ohlmer. Many of Benoist's accomplishments were destroyed during the Second Opium war. Following the invasion of Beijing by British and French forces, Lord Elgin ordered the looting and destruction of Yuanming Yuan as retribution for the execution of European journalists and prisoners of wars by Qing forces. The ruins were again destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900.

He was alleged to be the Consigliere of the Outfit. Early life Lombardo was born on January 1, 1929, in Chicago, one of 11 children to Italian immigrants from Bari, Mike Lombardi, a butcher, and Carmela Lombardi. Lombardo, a high school dropout, at some point changed the final letter of his last name. He joined the Outfit in the 1950s. Early career Lombardo began his Outfit career as a jewel thief and as a juice loan collector. In 1963, Lombardo was arrested and charged with kidnapping and loan sharking, but was acquitted after a factory worker who had owed $2,000 and who was behind on his payments could not positively identify Lombardo. The acquittal was Lombardo's 11th in 11 arrests. Lombardo, who by the late 1960s was referred to as an \\"up-and-comer\\" in the Chicago Outfit along with Angelo J. LaPietra (known as \\"The Hook\\"), would take over the Outfit's operations in Las Vegas in 1971. Bribery and skimming convictions On December 15, 1982, Lombardo was convicted, along with Teamsters Union President Roy Williams and insurance executive Allen Dorfman, with bribery of Nevada Senator Howard Cannon in order to get a trucking deregulation bill blocked. Lombardo was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in the bribe conspiracy. In 1986, Lombardo was convicted of skimming over $2 million in proceeds in several Strip casinos (including the Stardust Resort & Casino), and was sentenced to another 10 years in prison. Lombardo was released on November 13, 1992, after serving only 10 years in prison. Following his release, Lombardo took the unusual step of taking out a small classified ad in the Chicago Tribune that read: \\"I never took a secret oath, with guns and daggers, pricked my finger, drew blood or burned paper to join a criminal organization. If anyone hears my name used in connection with any criminal activity, please notify the FBI, local police, and my parole officer, Ron Kumke.\\" Indictment, fugitive, and Family Secrets trial In 2003, Chicago newspapers began reporting that federal investigators were looking into solving old mob murders. In 2003, the FBI swabbed Lombardo for DNA. Federal authorities also notified Lombardo during the probe that his life might be in danger. On April 25, 2005, Lombardo, along with 13 other defendants was indicted as part of the federal government's Operation Family Secrets investigation, which lifted the veil on 18 killings since the 1970s that federal investigators had attributed to the Outfit. Lombardo was indicted for his role in at least one murder, as well as for running a racket based on illegal gambling, loan sharking and murder. As federal agents rounded up the 14 defendants on April 25, 2005, they realized that Lombardo had disappeared, who became a fugitive after they issued a federal arrest warrant. While Lombardo's whereabouts were unknown, he wrote letters to his lawyer, Rick Halprin‚Äîbut directed toward the judge in the trial‚Äîin which he claimed to be innocent, requested a $50,000 recognizance bond, offered to take a lie detector test, and asked to be tried separately from the other defendants in the Family Secrets case‚Äîall requests that U.S. District Judge James Zagel denied. The first letter from Lombardo surfaced on May 4, 2005, was four pages long and riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. \\"I am no part of enterprise or (sic)... Have no part in the poker machines, extorcinate loans, gambling and what ever else the indictment says,\\" the letter read. About the 18 murders in the indictment, I want you to know that I was not privy before the murders, during the murders, and after the murders, and to this present writing to you.\\" Lombardo also told Zagel in the letter, \\"I want you to know that I am not a violent man in anyway shape or form. I do not own or have any weapons of any kind. If the F.B.I. should find me I will come peacefully and no resistence (sic) at all.\\" Lombardo also asked Zagel \\"If you have any ideas or suggestion of what I should do, notify my lawyer he could reach me by the media.\\" In August and September 2005, Lombardo sent more letters to his attorney, indicating that he had been following local news coverage of a state hearing involving allegations that the mayor of Rosemont, Illinois, Donald Stephens, had met with several members of the Chicago Outfit. In response, Halprin quipped of his still-at-large client's newspaper-reading habit: \\"I doubt that he has a home subscription.\\" The FBI then offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to Lombardo's capture. On January 13, 2006, after over eight months at large, a bearded, unkempt Lombardo, was captured by FBI agents outside the Elmwood Park, Illinois home of his longtime friend Dominic Calarco. Federal agents had been tipped off to Lombardo's whereabouts after Lombardo had visited dead Outfit mobster Tony Spilotro's dentist brother, Patrick Spilotro, for an abscessed tooth. He was carrying $3,000 at the time of the arrest. At his arraignment, Lombardo pleaded \\"not guilty\\". He also revealed that he had atherosclerosis and had not seen a doctor while he was at large because \\"I was ‚Äì what do they call it? I was unavailable\\", prompting laughter in the courtroom. During the trial, which was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mitchell Mars, T. Markus Funk, and John Scully, Lombardo took the stand in his own defense, denying any involvement in the Daniel Seifert murder and claiming to have been at a police station at the time of the slaying, reporting the disappearance of his wallet. Federal prosecutors, however, noted Lombardo's fingerprint on the title application for a car used in the murder of Seifert. In addition, prosecutors pointed out that employees of an electronics store identified Lombardo as the purchaser of a police scanner used in Seifert's murder. Seifert was murdered in Bensenville, Illinois on September 27, 1974, in execution-style, and federal prosecutors say it was committed in front of Seifert's wife, who was holding her young son in her arms. Conviction and sentencing On September 10, 2007, Lombardo was convicted of racketeering, extortion, loan sharking and murder. On September 27, 2007, the same jury found Lombardo guilty of the 1974 Seifert murder. On February 2, 2009, Zagel sentenced Lombardo, seated in a wheelchair, to life in prison for the convictions. Lombardo had continually professed his innocence, telling the court, \\"Now I suppose the court is going to send me to a life in prison for something I did not do.\\" He also said he was sorry for the suffering of the Seifert family but added, \\"I did not kill Danny Seifert.\\" Zagel had told Lombardo, \\"Mr. Lombardo, you are not like the toxic creature I've seen forming in one of your co-defendants,\\" referring to Frank Calabrese, Sr., whom Zagel had sentenced to life in prison the previous week, but after Lombardo had insisted his innocence, Zagel also said, \\"The worst things you have done are terrible and I see no regret in you.\\" Prison and death In September 2006, while in federal lockup at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago, Lombardo had a heart attack and was brought to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was diagnosed as having had a minor heart attack; he was put into an operating room where he underwent surgery, to have a stent installed‚Äîhis fourth stent procedure. It was also reported he suffered from throat cancer and that his gallbladder had been removed. He served his sentence at ADX Florence supermax prison, where he died on October 19, 2019, at the age of 90. Personal life Lombardo earned the nickname \\"The Clown\\" from his joking demeanor and for his various antics, including grinning wide for mug shots and for departing a 1981 court appearance at the federal courts building in Chicago holding a Chicago Sun-Times newspaper in front of his face with a hole cut out so he could see. In 2005, Halprin spoke to the Chicago Tribune about his client's nickname, saying \\"[T]hat's a name he doesn't relish, and neither do I. The guy I know is not a clown.\\" Lombardo married Marion Nigro in a Catholic ceremony in 1951. They had two children. Lombardo lived in the same modest condominium building on West Ohio Street, on the Near West Side of Chicago, from the time he was married until he became a fugitive in 2005. Lombardo and his wife, Marion, reportedly divorced in 1991, but Lombardo continued to reside in the same condominium building, moving after his divorce to a basement unit. In 2006, federal prosecutors alleged that Lombardo's divorce was a sham to hide money. \\"If you think it's a sham divorce, investigate it\\", Lombardo's attorney Rick Halprin told reporters on February 9, 2006. Prosecutors said Marion Lombardo appeared to have sold three parcels in Florida held by the MJJ Trust for more than $4.5 million in 2003. They said there is a May 1992 dissolution of marriage record but that it appears the Lombardos lived together until the latest indictment. They said two warranty deeds recording the sale of the Florida property referred to Marion Lombardo as \\"a married woman\\". Lombardo's lawyer had stated that the assets had been placed in an \\"irrevocable trust\\" for Lombardo's family.

In the serial, the Daleks and a human expedition both arrive on the planet Exxilon to seek a mineral found in abundance there. This was the last serial to have an episode wiped, but all episodes are retained in the archives. Plot The TARDIS suffers an energy drain and crash-lands on the planet Exxilon. The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith go to investigate the cause of the interference, and become separated. The Doctor is captured by the planet's inhabitants, the savage Exxilons, but escapes. Sarah is attacked by one of the creatures in the TARDIS, and flees, finding a huge city with a flashing beacon. At dawn the Doctor is found by a party of the Marine Space Corps; they take him to their ship, which has been stranded by a power drain. They are on an expedition to mine \\"Parrinium\\" ‚Äì a mineral abundant only on Exxilon ‚Äì which can cure and give immunity from a deadly space plague. If the expedition does not leave the planet with a supply of Parrinium within a month then millions will die. They show the Doctor photos of the nearby city ‚Äì which the Exxilons worship, sacrificing anyone who ventures too close. Sarah does so and is captured and taken to the Exxilons' caves to be sacrificed by their High Priest. A ship containing four Daleks arrives; both the ship and their weapons have been rendered useless by the energy drain. The Daleks encounter the Doctor and attempt to exterminate him, but their weapons do not work. The Daleks claim that several of their planetary colonies are suffering from plague; thus they need Parrinium for the same reason as the humans. The Daleks, the Doctor, and the humans form an uneasy alliance to obtain Parrinium and escape Exxilon. While the allies are making their way to the humans' mining dome, the Exxilons ambush them. A massive battle ensues and the Exxilons end up killing a human and a Dalek and capturing the others. The prisoners are taken to the Exxilon caves where the Doctor interrupts Sarah Jane's sacrifice; therefore, he is also condemned to death. When the dual sacrifice commences, a second party of Daleks, who have replaced their energy weapons with firearms, attack in force, killing a number of Exxilons. They force the Exxilons and humans to mine Parrinium. The Doctor and Sarah flee into tunnels. The other party of Daleks arrive and they discuss their actual plan to use Parrinium to create a plague and spread it across every planet except their own. The Doctor and Sarah meet a group of subterranean, fugitive Exxilons. Their leader, Bellal, explains that the city was built by the Exxilons' ancestors, who were once capable of space travel. They built the city to be capable of maintaining, repairing, and protecting itself. Fitting the structure with a brain meant that the city no longer needed its creators. On realising this, the Exxilons had tried to destroy the city, but the city destroyed most of them; the savage surface dwellers and Bellal's group are the only survivors. Bellal's people seek to complete their ancestors' last, failed act ‚Äì to destroy the city and ensure their race's survival. Bellal sketches some of the markings on the city wall; the Doctor recognises the markings from a temple in Peru deducing that the ancient Exxilons visited Earth. Bellal also explains that the city supports itself through underground \\"roots\\" and the aerial beacon. The Doctor realises that the beacon must be the cause of the energy drain and decides to go to the city and resolve the problem. The Daleks come to the same conclusion and create two timed explosives to destroy the beacon. One Dalek supervises two humans placing the explosives, but one of the humans, Galloway, secretly keeps one bomb. Two other Daleks enter the city to investigate the superstructure, but the Doctor and Bellal enter the city just before them. The two parties then proceed through the city, passing a series of progressive intelligence tests. The Doctor reasons that the city has arranged the tests so that only lifeforms with knowledge comparable to that of the city's creators would reach the brain, allowing the city to add the knowledge of the survivors to its databanks. On reaching the central chamber, the Doctor begins to sabotage the city's computer brain; the machine responds by creating two Exxilon-like \\"antibodies\\" to \\"neutralise\\" the Doctor and Bellal. The pair are saved when the Daleks enter and fight the antibodies, and the Doctor and Bellal escape as the city's sabotaged controls begin to malfunction. The two Daleks inside are destroyed. When the bomb on the beacon explodes, all power is restored. The Daleks order the humans to load the Parrinium onto their ship. On leaving Exxilon, the Daleks intend to fire a plague missile onto the planet, destroying all life and making future landings impossible, so that they will have the only source of Parrinium. Their true intention for hoarding Parrinium is to blackmail the galactic powers to accept their demands; refusal would mean the deaths of millions. As their ship takes off, Sarah reveals that the Daleks have only bags of sand while the real Parrinium is on the Earth ship, which is now ready to take off. Galloway has smuggled himself and his bomb aboard the Dalek ship; he detonates the bomb, destroying the Dalek ship before it fires the plague missile. Back on Exxilon, the City disintegrates and collapses, the Doctor sadly commenting that the Universe is now down to 699 Wonders. Production Working titles for this story were The Exilons and The Exxilons. The incidental music for this serial was composed by Carey Blyton and performed by the London Saxophone Quartet. This is one of two Third Doctor serials (the other being The Claws of Axos) to still have a 90-minute PAL studio recording tape. =Missing episodes= Part One of this story was chronologically the last to have its original master videotape wiped for re- use. This was initially returned to the BBC archive in 1981 through the discovery of a 525-line NTSC recording from Canada. Subsequently, two separate PAL recordings were discovered, including a high quality 625-line recording returned in 1991 as part of a shipment from Dubai. The other PAL copy had been returned to the BBC from Australia in 1985, although it had been edited and censored. Broadcast and reception Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \\"A confused story with, for once, too much rather than too little plot. There really doesn't seem any need to have the Daleks in it at all. There are some adequate sacrifice scenes for Sarah to scream in, but the production seems tired and insipid\\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were more positive, even opining that it was the best of the eleventh season. They wrote that, despite the \\"small scale\\" action, \\"the scripts are still well-written and entertaining, with a good premise and some interesting concepts\\", and the story overall was \\"of excellent set pieces and impressive images\\". However, Howe and Walker were less impressed with the model shots of the city disintegrating, the Exxilons' character depth, and the incidental music. In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times wrote that the story had appeal, with the Daleks at their \\"duplicitous best\\" and the first episode being \\"arguably the most effective episode of season 11\\". However, he was critical of Blyton's score and felt that Pertwee and the guest cast seemed unenthused, and also noted that the Doctor and Sarah lacked chemistry and the Doctor \\"verges on insufferably patronising and is landed with dreadful lines\\". DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave Death to the Daleks four out of five stars, praising the Daleks, the pace, and the supporting characters, and in contrast to Mulkern, he praised the chemistry between the Doctor and Sarah. However, he felt that the ending in which the Doctor solves puzzles was simplistic and lacked suspense. Ian Berriman, reviewing the serial for SFX, rated it three out of four stars, describing it as \\"a perfectly adequate four episodes of generic action-adventure\\". Berriman praised the atmospheric direction, Bellal, and felt that the score \\"effectively conjures an air of the uncanny\\". However, he felt that the Daleks were \\"daft\\", and criticised the puzzle plot and Jill, the \\"feeble\\" sole female character. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in July 1978. A German translation was published in 1990 by Goldmann. =Home media= The serial was released on video in an omnibus format in July 1987, the first Doctor Who video to be released on just VHS, instead of both VHS and Betamax. As the PAL version of episode one was not yet known to exist, this used the NTSC version of the episode. In the US, it was released by Playhouse Video (a subsidiary of CBS/Fox Video) on VHS and Beta. An episodic release (with the PAL version of episode one) was released on 13 February 1995, although episode two was slightly edited due to BBC Video mistakenly using a cut version of episode 2 returned from ABC TV in Australia (episodes 3 & 4 were also from ABC TV), instead of the UK master tapes of episodes 2‚Äì4. Death to the Daleks was released on DVD in the UK on 18 June 2012, and in region 1 on 10 July 2012.

Detecting and understanding the QGP allows physicists to understand better the Universe in the seconds after the Big Bang, when the presently-observed symmetries (and asymmetries) of the Universe were established. Unlike other physics experiments where a theoretical prediction can be tested directly by a single measurement, STAR must make use of a variety of simultaneous studies in order to draw strong conclusions about the QGP. This is due both to the complexity of the system formed in the high-energy nuclear collision and the unexplored landscape of the physics studied. STAR therefore consists of several types of detectors, each specializing in detecting certain types of particles or characterizing their motion. These detectors work together in an advanced data acquisition and subsequent physics analysis that allows definitive statements to be made about the collision. The physics of STAR In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, the expanding matter was so hot and dense that protons and neutrons could not exist. Instead, the early universe comprised a plasma of quarks and gluons, which in today's cool universe are confined and exist only within composite particles (bound states) - the hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. Collisions of heavy nuclei at sufficiently high energies allow physicists to study whether quarks and gluons become deconfined at high densities, and if so, what the properties of this matter (i.e. quark‚Äìgluon plasma) are. In particular, STAR studies the collective expansion of the hot quark-gluon matter, such as the elliptic flow. This allows to extract the transport coefficients that characterize the quark-gluon matter, including the shear and bulk viscosity, and to investigate macroscopic quantum phenomena, such as the chiral magnetic effect.  Collaboration governance  The governance of STAR is via two branches: the institutional Council which is run by a Chairperson elected from the Council ranks, and elected Spokesperson(s) and their management team. The Spokesperson(s) represent the Collaboration in scientific, technical, and managerial concerns. The Council deals with general issues that concern the collaboration. Examples include the organization and governance of the Collaboration, adoption of bylaws and amendments thereto, the policy on admission of new members institutions to the Collaboration, and Policies for the Publication and Presentation of STAR Results. The term of the office of the Council Chair is nominally two years. he Council elects, a Spokesperson or a team of two Spokespersons who then serve at the discretion of the Council.

She was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and worked at her home in Montclair, New Jersey. Hutchins‚Äô greatest innovation, still used by many violinmakers, was a technique known as free-plate tuning. When not attached to a violin, the top and back are called free plates. Her technique gives makers a precise way to refine these plates before a violin is assembled. From 2002 to 2003, Hutchins‚Äôs octet was the subject of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Titled ‚ÄúThe New Violin Family: Augmenting the String Section.‚Äù Hutchins was the founder of the New Violin Family Association, creator-in-chief of the Violin Octet, author of more than 100 technical publications, editor of two volumes of collected papers in violin acoustics, four grants from the Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund for Music, recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships, an Honorary Fellowship from the Acoustical Society of America, and four honorary doctorates. In 1963, Hutchins co-founded the Catgut Acoustical Society, which develops scientific insights into the construction of new and conventional instruments of the violin family. The Hutchins Consort, named after Hutchins, is a California ensemble featuring all eight instruments. In 1974, Hutchins and Daniel W. Haines, using materials supplied by the Hercules Materials Company, Inc. (Allegany Ballistics Laboratory) of Cumberland, Maryland, developed a graphite-epoxy composite top that was determined to be a successful alternative to the traditional use of spruce for the violin belly.

It is associated in particular with Rangers F.C.. Origins Billy Boys originated in the 1920s as the signature tune of the Brigton Boys, also called The Billy Boys of Brigton Cross, who were a Protestant street gang in Bridgeton (an area of Glasgow historically associated with the city's Protestant population, and with Scottish unionism - Brigton is the Scots form of Bridgeton) led by Billy Fullerton. The gang often clashed with Roman Catholic gangs such as the Norman Conks and the Calton Tongs.Petrol bomb pensioner shows old gang hatreds die hard, Janey Godley, The Scotsman, 6 January 2008 Fullerton was a member of the British Fascists who was awarded a medal for strike-breaking during the 1926 General Strike and formed a Glasgow branch of the British Union of Fascists with the onset of World War II.Razor gangs ruled the streets but even in the violence of pre-war years, one man stood out, Daily Record, 19 October 2007 The Billy Boys song was often sung loudly when the gang performed it. They regularly sang it when they marched through primarily Catholic areas of Glasgow on Catholic holy days. This often led to the Brigton Boys being attacked by members of the Norman Conks as a result. Despite being primarily based in Glasgow, in the 1930s the Brigton Boys were invited to march in Belfast and sang Billy Boys while they were there as part of The Twelfth celebrations. The Brigton Boys and their youth wing, the Derry Boys, started to attend association football matches in the late 1920s and early 1930s. During this time, they attended Rangers matches and Rangers fans started to sing the Billy Boys song as part of a perceived affiliation with the Brigton Boys. Despite Percy Sillitoe, the Chief Constable of Glasgow, eradicating the Glasgow razor gangs and most young Protestants joining the Orange Order instead of the remaining gangs, Rangers fans continued to sing the Billy Boys in tribute to Fullerton as he still retained a prominent position among Glasgow Protestants even after the gangs had disbanded. The Orange Order then adopted the \\"Billy Boys\\" song and changed the lyrics to be played on Orange walks, with the references to Billy being altered to refer to King William III of England, Scotland and Ireland.  Football song  =Rangers= Rangers F.C. supporters adopted \\"Billy Boys\\" as part of a perceived affiliation with the Brigton Boys Even after Fullerton's death, Rangers fans continued to sing \\"Billy Boys\\" to commemorate Fullerton and the Brigton Boys. In later years, attempts were made to portray the song as being against Irish republicanism rather than Catholics. In 1999, the Scotland national football team manager Craig Brown was filmed singing \\"Billy Boys\\" and faced calls to step down from his position in charge of the Scotland national football team. However, the Scottish Football Association (SFA) gave him their backing. The song was at the centre of a controversy surrounding \\"ninety-minute bigots\\", an expression allegedly coined by former Rangers chairman Sir David Murray: \\"Ninety-minute Bigots do not hold beliefs but nonetheless sing songs at football matches which are sectarian, simply to join in with the rest of the crowd.\\" Rangers have adopted several measures to tackle this behaviour including attempts to bring older Rangers songs back into popular use, with Murray speaking out against the singing of the \\"Billy Boys\\" on many occasions. In 2006, Rangers were charged by UEFA for discriminatory chanting over the singing of \\"Billy Boys\\" during a UEFA Champions League game against Villarreal. Rangers were found not guilty due to \\"Billy Boys\\" having been sung for years without the SFA or the Scottish government intervening against it and ruled that it was tolerated as a social and historic song. However, after an appeal where they were warned, Rangers were ordered by UEFA to make a public announcement at all home games, prohibiting the singing of the song despite UEFA admitting they were unable to do anything about it because it was a Scottish social issue. In 2011, \\"Billy Boys\\" was included in a list of chants that had been banned from Scottish football grounds as part of new legislation from the Scottish government. It was specifically banned because of its \\"Up to our knees in Fenian blood\\" line. It was banned because it was decided by the Scottish government that \\"Fenian\\" in the context of the song meant Roman Catholics and was thus sectarian despite Rangers fans stating that it meant Irish republicans or fans of their Old Firm rivals, Celtic. Despite the ban, \\"Billy Boys\\" has still been sung at Rangers matches, including their match against Queen's Park at Hampden Park in 2012.Queen's Park 0 Rangers 1: Onwards and upwards, The Herald, 30 December 2012 It is sometimes sung without the \\"Fenian\\" line but has also been sung in its original form. Other Scottish football clubs, among them Heart of Midlothian, Kilmarnock, and Dundee, use versions of \\"Billy Boys\\" adapted to support their own clubs. =Northern Ireland= The Billy Boys song has also been used in Northern Ireland, which may have arisen as a result of the Brigton Boys' march in Belfast. It is often used by supporters of Belfast club Linfield due to historic links with Rangers as \\"Blues Brothers\\". The song was sung in 2013 by supporters of the Northern Ireland national football team during their match against Luxembourg at Stade Josy Barthel in protest against the Northern Ireland team anthem, God Save the Queen, not being played at the Irish Cup final. In April 2014, the Irish Football Association (IFA) introduced punishments for \\"any ... song or chant that is undeniably sectarian or offensive\\". Linfield advised their supporters that this included all variations of Billy Boys, including the Marching Through Georgia tune. The IFA based their decision on the precedent from the UEFA decision regarding Billy Boys and Rangers in 2006. There was doubt expressed by fans as to how the IFA would enforce the ban on the Marching Through Georgia tune if it was used in a song other than Billy Boys. Lyrics The 'Derry Boys' were a smaller, youth faction of the Billy Boys, and the original version used the term Brigton Billy Boys in its place.

The notion of information infrastructures, introduced in the 1990s and refined during the following decade, has proven quite fruitful to the information systems (IS) field. It changed the perspective from organizations to networks and from systems to infrastructure, allowing for a global and emergent perspective on information systems. Information infrastructure is a technical structure of an organizational form, an analytical perspective or a semantic network. The concept of information infrastructure (II) was introduced in the early 1990s, first as a political initiative (Gore, 1993 & Bangemann, 1994), later as a more specific concept in IS research. For the IS research community, an important inspiration was Hughes‚Ä≤ (1983) accounts of large technical systems, analyzed as socio- technical power structures (Bygstad, 2008).Bygstad, Bendik (2008). \\"Information infrastructure as an organization: a critical realist view.\\" Retrieved from http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~phddays/15thPhDDays/Documents/Paper_Bendik.pdf Information infrastructure, as a theory, has been used to frame a number of extensive case studies (Star and Ruhleder 1996; Ciborra 2000; Hanseth and Ciborra 2007), and in particular to develop an alternative approach to IS design: \\"Infrastructures should rather be built by establishing working local solutions supporting local practices which subsequently are linked together rather than by defining universal standards and subsequently implementing them\\" (Ciborra and Hanseth 1998). It has later been developed into a full design theory, focusing on the growth of an installed base (Hanseth and Lyytinen 2008). Information infrastructures include the Internet, health systems and corporate systems.Johnson, Nathan R. (2012). \\"Information Infrastructure as Rhetoric:Tools for Analysis\\".

It is also consistent to include innovations such as Facebook, LinkedIn and MySpace as excellent examples (Bygstad, 2008). Bowker has described several key terms and concepts that are enormously helpful for analyzing information infrastructure: imbrication, bootstrapping, figure/ground, and a short discussion of infrastructural inversion. \\"Imbrication\\" is an analytic concept that helps to ask questions about historical data. \\"Bootstrapping\\" is the idea that infrastructure must already exist in order to exist (2011).

Judson (March 7, 1843 - December 7, 1909) was an American machine salesman, mechanical engineer and inventor. He received thirty patents over a sixteen-year career, fourteen of which were on pneumatic street railway innovations. Six of his patents had to do with a motor mechanism suspended beneath the rail-car that functioned with compressed air. He founded the Judson Pneumatic Street Railway. Judson is most noted for his invention of the common zipper. It was originally called a clasp-locker. The first application was as a fastener for shoes and high boots. The patent said it could be used wherever it was desirable to connect a pair of adjacent flexible parts that could be detached easily. Possible applications noted were for corsets, gloves, and mail bags. Early life Judson was born March 7, 1843 in Chicago, Illinois. He served in the Union Army and enlisted in 1861 at Oneida, Illinois in the 42nd Illinois Infantry Regiment according to the Illinois State Archives. Judson attended Knox College in his hometown Galesburg, Illinois. He was found in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1886. In 1886 and 1887 the Minneapolis city directory identified Judson as a \\"traveling agent\\" -- a traveling salesman working probably for Pitts Agricultural Works. A couple of years later Judson began working for Earle Manufacturing Company with Harry L. Earle as the head of the firm. Judson sold band cutters and grain scales for them along with other items as one of their salesmen.Friedel, p. 5 Career =Street railway= Judson began his efforts of making inventions around 1888 to 1889. His concentration was on inventions for a \\"pneumatic street railway\\". His first patented invention was for a \\"mechanical movement\\" related to that. In 1889, Judson obtained six patents related to his concept of a street railway running on compressed air. The concept was similar to the cable railway system but with pistons suspended beneath the rail-car. Judson received a total of 14 patents related to this type of railway system out of the 30 patents he had. Similar systems were tried throughout the nineteenth century, however, they all failed because of sealing problems. Judson's similar inventions were also impractical and as a whole not very successful. The street railway concept ultimately went electric. Judson Pneumatic Street Railway was initiated by Judson and Earle was one of the promoters. It even had a demonstration line in 1890 in Washington, D.C. for about a mile that was at what is today Georgia Avenue. It ran for only a few weeks before the company shut it down due to technical problems. A cable streetcar firm bought them out and turned it into an electric streetcar since Judson's system was impractical.Friedel, pp. 6-10 =Zipper= Judson's most noteworthy invention, a chain-lock fastener, was the precursor to the modern zipper which he developed and invented in 1891. Judson is recognized as the inventor of the zipper.Travers, p. 702 \\"The zipper was invented by Whitcomb L. Judson, a Chicago, Illinois, mechanical engineer.\\" He also invented a \\"clasp- locker\\" automation production machine that made his fastener device inexpensively.Travers, pp. 702-703 His metal zipper fastener device was called a \\"clasp-locker\\" in his day, not a zipper -- which name came into existence many years after his death. The \\"clasp locker\\" was a complicated hook-and-eye fastener with an arrangement of hooks and eyes run by a \\"guide\\" for closing and opening a clothing item. The first application was as a shoe fastener and there is mention in the patents for possible applications for corsets, gloves, mail bags, and \\"generally wherever it is desired to detachably connect a pair adjacent flexible parts.\\" Friedel, p. 16 It is also said one of the reasons he invented this device was to relieve the tedium of fastening high button boots that were fashionable in those days. Judson's first slide fastener patent was applied for in November 1891. At the time the United States Patent Office didn't require a working model of a patent, only that the invention was to be a novel idea. However, his invention was almost rejected by the patent assistant examiner Thomas Hart Anderson because there were several types of shoe fasteners already patented. He applied for a second patent on an improved version for the same item some nine months later before the first was even approved.Friedel, p. 2 The patent was approved in May 1893 after the last amendment was filed with an improved version. When the two patents were finally issued on August 29 (along with 378 others that day), they received the numbers U.S.P. 504,038 (first) and U.S.P. 504,037 (second). These patents describe several designs of the \\"clasp-locker\\". Later design patents of the fastener describe opposite elements on each side that are identical to each other and fit together by the engaging of \\"pintles\\" and \\"sockets.\\" In his patent U.S.P. 557,207 of 1896 is a description mostly like the zipper of today. In 1893, Judson exhibited his new invention at the Chicago World's Fair where it had its debut. Judson launched the Universal Fastener Company to manufacture his new invention, together with Harry L. Earle and Lewis Walker. The Universal Fastener Company started out in Chicago and then moved to Elyria, Ohio. It then moved to Catasauqua, Pennsylvania, and then to Hoboken, New Jersey. The name changed eventually to Automatic Hook and Eye Company.Ups and Down of the Zipper, by Thomas V. DiBacco of The Washington Post, Washington, D.C.: March 29, 1982, p. W15 Judson's \\"clasp-locker\\" met with little commercial success at first. He ultimately never saw much success in the \\"clasp-locker\\" as a fashion item during his lifetime. Judson made a \\"C-curity\\" clasp-locker fastener in 1905 which was an improved version of his previous patents. It tended to break open unexpectedly like the predecessors. Clothing manufacturers showed little interest in Judson's fastener perhaps because of this reason. An improved version of 1896 came with Judson made his invention to save people the trouble of buttoning and unbuttoning their shoes every day as shows in his wording in the patent application. He describes this in his patent U.S.P. 557,207 In 1913, the zipper was improved by the Swedish- American engineer, Gideon Sundback, and also by Catharina Kuhn-Moos of Europe. Sundback successfully redesigned Judson's fastener into a more streamlined and reliable form called \\"Talon.\\" Automatic Hook and Eye Company then changed its name to the Hookless Fastener Company. In 1937 the Hookless Fastener Company became Talon, Inc. In 1918, a textile company manufactured flying suits for the United States Navy with this fastener. Judson's company received an order for thousands of their \\"clasp-locker\\" fasteners. Soon thereafter they appeared on gloves and tobacco pouches. The B. F. Goodrich company in 1923 installed these fasteners in their rubber galoshes, calling the new design \\"Zippers.\\" This then became the name of the fastener itself. The design of the fastener today is much like Sundback's improvement of Judson's \\"clasp-locker.\\"  Personal life  Judson married his wife, Annie Martin, in 1874. They had three children: Jane, Gertrude, and Ross.Leslie, p. 19 Ross became vice- president of Continental Motor Manufacturing Company that developed the first automobile hydraulic system co-innovated by Judson. Later life Judson lived in New York City for the later part of his life. He moved in 1906 to Muskegon, Michigan. There he died at the age of 63 on December 7, 1909.Friedel, p. 10  Footnotes   References  Sources *Friedel, Robert, Zipper: An Exploration in Novelty, W. W.

Sizemore has never held elected office, but has nonetheless been a major political figure in Oregon since the 1990s. He is considered one of the main proponents of the Oregon tax revolt, a movement that seeks to reduce taxes in the state. Oregon Taxpayers United, a political action committee he founded in 1993, has advanced numerous ballot initiatives limiting taxation, and has opposed spending initiatives. Sizemore made an unsuccessful run for Governor of Oregon in 1998. He also announced his intention to run for governor in 2010, but was indicted by the state on charges of tax evasion. The charges were later amended to failure to file tax returns.  Early life  Sizemore was born in Aberdeen, Washington on June 2, 1951. He graduated from Montesano High School in Montesano, Washington where he played varsity basketball and was voted by his teammates as the best defensive player and most inspirational player. He earned a degree in theology from Portland Bible College in 1976. After graduating, Sizemore taught Old Testament History and Systematic Christian Theology at Portland Bible College and ran a series of businesses, including a retail carpet business, a toy manufacturing company, and two Portland radio stations. For four years he hosted the Bill Sizemore Show, a two-hour daily news/talk program on Great Talk 1150 AM.  Ballot initiatives  In 1993, Sizemore founded Oregon Taxpayers United and became its executive director. He is noted as the author and driving force behind a number of ballot initiatives in Oregon. One of the first measures Sizemore was involved in was a referendum which stopped Portland's $3.4 billion light rail expansion. Sizemore added several initiatives in 2008. Sizemore's most notable success was passing Measure 47 in 1996. The measure rolled back property taxes to 1995 levels. Measure 47 also mandated a double majority for ballot measures increasing taxes. With Sizemore's assistance, the Oregon Legislative Assembly amended some of the provisions of Measure 47 in 1997,Official Results: State Measure No. 47, November 5, 1996 General Election. Oregon Secretary of State. Retrieved January 9, 2008. and referred the amendments back to the voters as Measure 50, which also passed.Official Results: State Measure No. 50, May 20, 1997 Statewide Special Election. Oregon Secretary of State. Retrieved January 9, 2008. In 2000, Sizemore drafted and placed on the ballot Measure 7, which required governments to pay just compensation to property owners when a government-imposed regulation reduced the fair market value of their property. Oregon voters approved Measure 7, but the Oregon Supreme Court later nullified it. A similar measure, 2004's Measure 37, subsequently passed, and was amended by 2007's Measure 49.  1998 gubernatorial election  Sizemore ran for Governor of Oregon as a Republican in 1998. He won his party's primary, defeating the Republican Party Chairman and three other candidates who had little or no name recognition. During the general election, The Oregonian ran three major articles detailing Sizemore's alleged shady business practices, both in private business and in the operation of his political action committee and non-profit educational foundation. These included one about a \\"Trail of Debt\\" he had allegedly left behind, one of which involved an outstanding loan from a fellow church member, which Sizemore says was eventually repaid; one about a fishing club on a private lake, to which he tried to sell memberships before obtaining state permission; and one about an apparently falsified loan application on which he claimed not to have declared bankruptcy when, in fact, he had done so. Sizemore said he did not check the boxes on the loan application relating to bankruptcy and that the loan officer who submitted the application did that on his own. Sizemore lost the November general election to incumbent Governor John Kitzhaber, a Democrat. Sizemore won 30% of the vote, to Kitzhaber's 64%.Official Results: November 3, 1998 General Election, Governor. Oregon Secretary of State. Retrieved January 9, 2008.  Racketeering case  Bill Sizemore (2008) In July 2000, the Oregon Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers filed a civil racketeering lawsuit against two of Sizemore's organizations: Oregon Taxpayers United and the OTU Education Foundation. Sizemore was not named personally as a defendant or party to the case. During the trial Becky Miller, Sizemore's top aide, under protection of state and federal immunity deals, testified in detail about allegedly unethical and illegal practices of Oregon Taxpayers United. These included alleged money laundering involving both Sizemore and Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist, as well as falsification of federal tax returns and state campaign finance reports. Additional testimony reported financial deals allegedly designed to disguise or hide the sources of funding for campaigns, as well as to allow Sizemore to personally profit from the campaigns. After three weeks of testimony and a million dollars in union legal fees, the jury found Sizemore's organizations guilty of racketeering, and the organizations were fined approximately $2.5 million. Sizemore refused to pay the fines and attempted to continue doing business by changing the name of his organizations to Oregon Taxpayers Association and carrying on with business as usual.American Federation of Teachers-Oregon v. Oregon Taxpayers United. Oregon Judicial Department, October 4, 2006. Retrieved January 9, 2008. After a post-trial hearing in which no evidence was submitted Sizemore was found personally liable for his organization's civil racketeering liability, and the judge shut down his 501(c)(3) education foundation. On appeal both sides claimed victory, as the Oregon Taxpayers United organizations were found liable for the judgments but the personal judgment against Sizemore was nullified by the Oregon Supreme Court.  Measure 42 in 2006  In 2006, Sizemore broke with his pattern of anti-tax measures by filing Measure 42, a consumer-oriented bill that would have denied insurance companies the ability to take credit scores into account when setting insurance premiums. In the most expensive Oregon ballot measure campaign of 2006, the insurance industry spent $4 million to defeat the measure. The campaign to defeat the measure, which focused heavily on Sizemore's credibility, was successful. Arrest in 2008 On December 1, 2008, Sizemore was sent to jail after a Multnomah County judge found him in contempt of court for the fourth time in his long-running legal battle with two Oregon teachers unions. Multnomah County Circuit Judge Janice R. Wilson ordered Sizemore, who was not an officer of the corporation, jailed until he signed and filed federal and state tax forms that charitable organizations are required to complete to maintain their tax-exempt status. He was released the next day on December 2, 2008.  2010 gubernatorial election  On November 23, Sizemore announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for Governor of Oregon in 2010. On November 30, Sizemore and his wife were indicted by the State of Oregon on charges of tax evasion for failing to file state income tax returns for the years 2006‚Äì2008. He had previously acknowledged failing to file in sworn testimony and was indicted after he failed to file during Oregon's tax amnesty ended on November 19. Sizemore called the charges politically inspired and said he had paid $50,000 in estimated taxes for 2006 and 2007, but could not file actual returns until an ongoing civil case resolved the amount of his income for the years in question. Teachers union and Department of Justice lawyers had claimed in court that Sizemore had personally taken $850,000 from a nonprofit he had been running, but a later audit by the Oregon Department of Revenue determined that Sizemore's income for the years in question was $500,000 less than the teachers unions and Oregon DOJ lawyers had claimed. In 2011, after the judge in the case ruled that Sizemore would not be allowed to put on any defense, he pleaded guilty to three counts of felony failure to file state income-tax returns, with a plea agreement to serve 30 days jail and 3 years probation. Three years later Marion County Judge Claudia Burton retroactively converted the felonies to misdemeanors and all of Sizemore's rights were restored.

The Global JXDM is a product of the Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative's (Global) Infrastructure and Standards Working Group (ISWG), and was developed by the Global ISWG's XML Structure Task Force (XSTF). The Global JXDM is a comprehensive product that includes a data model, a data dictionary, and an XML schema that together is known as the Global JXDM. Global JXDM is independent of vendors, operating systems, storage media, and applications and is quickly becoming key technology for assisting how criminal and judicial organizations exchange information. The Global JXDM is sponsored by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), with development supported by the Global XML Structure Task Force (GXSTF), which works closely with researchers at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). New releases are issued by the GXSTF, which reviews and evaluates each version of the Global JXDM. The GXSTF solicits feedback from technical experts and practitioners in both industry and government and authorizes Global JXDM changes based on this feedback. All approved additions, deletions, and modifications are applied to future releases, with a cumulative change log published along with each release. When a reasonable number of updates are approved by the GXSTF, a new version is released. The Global JXDM is an XML standard designed specifically for criminal justice information exchanges, providing law enforcement, public safety agencies, prosecutors, public defenders, and the judicial branch with a tool to effectively share data and information in a timely manner. The Global JXDM removes the burden from agencies to independently create exchange standards, and because of its extensibility, there is more flexibility to deal with unique agency requirements and changes. Through the use of a common vocabulary that is understood system-to-system, the Global JXDM enables access from multiple sources and reuse in multiple applications.  History  The federal government has long encouraged criminal justice agencies throughout the country to share information electronically. Historically, however, justice agencies have developed or invested in information systems independently of one another. While the applications that different organizations utilize to manage cases and store important information typically perform very similar functions, they often utilize unique technology or formatting that makes them incompatible with other systems. Consequently, many justice agencies have been forced to resort to inefficient methods of delivering information to each other, such as delivering important filings and documents via the postal service. In March 2001, the OJP and the DOJ sponsored an effort to create a framework for the secure and timely sharing of information across the justice domain. Their objective was to lay the foundation for local, state, tribal, and national interoperability by providing a ‚Äúcommon ground‚Äù that information systems across the country could use for data exchanges. After a two-year effort, the first prerelease of GJXDM was released in April 2003.  Data Dictionary  When criminal justice agencies share data, they transmit Information Exchange Packages (IEPs) to each other. An IEP is a set of data that is transmitted between agencies for a specific purpose. For example, if a police department wanted the local prosecutor to charge an individual for a crime, the IEP sent from the police department would contain a very specific set of data (victim name, date and time of the offense, etc.) as well as any associated artifacts (dashcam video, 911 audio transcript). Complications arise, however, from the fact that the justice community does not utilize a standard, common vocabulary when describing and recording events. Differences in terminologies can make it difficult or impossible for shared data to be interpreted and utilized. For example, if the police department in the above scenario utilizes the term \\"Supervision Official\\" to describe the officer in charge of an arrest, while the prosecutor typically uses it to describe an officer supervising a suspect, the transmitted IEP will result in confusion. The Global Justice XML Data Dictionary (Global JXDD or GJXDD) provides a solution to this problem by defining the common vocabulary utilized in the GJXDM. The GJXDD breaks down the information that is exchanged between agencies into individual data components and gives them unique names and definitions. These data components in turn serve as the ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù of data exchanges. Because the GJXDD defines a massive number of data components, smaller data dictionaries must be created for individual IEPs. These data dictionaries only contain the concepts and definitions relevant to their corresponding data transfers.  Data Model  While data dictionaries define the vocabulary utilized by the GJXDM to transmit IEPs, the relationships between the different data components need to be defined in order for the data to be interpreted correctly. For example, the personal information for a number of people may be included in a data exchange regarding a burglary. If the relationships between these data components are not defined, it will be impossible for justice professionals to distinguish the personal information of the owner of the house from that of the person who burglarized it. The GJXDM utilizes data models to describe the relationships between the different \\"building blocks\\" included in an IEP. Data models link these different concepts together by the use of two types of relationships: ‚Äúis_a‚Äù and ‚Äúhas_a.‚Äù The ‚Äúis_a‚Äù type is used when one object or concept inherits characteristics from another type. The ‚Äúhas_a‚Äù relationship shows what kind of information an object has. In the example above, the burglar ‚Äúis_a‚Äù person, while an investigating officer ‚Äúhas_a‚Äù Employment Person ID.  Reuse Repository  The true power of the GJXDM lies in its reuse repository, known as the IEPD Clearinghouse. Whenever a data dictionary and data model are created for an IEP, they are packaged within Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD). These IEPDs can be utilized as standards or templates for the creation of IEPs. For example, if an agency created an IEPD for an arrest filing, they could submit the IEPD to the Clearinghouse, where it could be downloaded by any agency wishing to facilitate electronic arrest filings. This saves agencies a great deal of time and resources as they don't have to create an arrest filing data dictionary and data model from scratch.  Version 3.0.3  In September, 2005, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), together with the Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative (Global), officially issued a newer version of the Global Justice Extensible Markup Language (XML) Data Model (Global JXDM) to the justice community, Version 3.0.3. This \\"maintenance\\" release of the Version 3.0 Global JXDM series is enhanced to increase the ability of justice and public safety communities to share justice information at all levels laying the foundation for local, state, and national justice interoperability. Some of the enhancements incorporated into Version 3.0.3 include the addition of new components that are compatible with previous version 3.0.2, new \\"sequenceID\\" values for \\"PersonNameType\\" sub-elements to assign an alternate ordering independent of the physical XML sequence, and an updated Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) resource that incorporates content from the Global JXDM Version 3.0 Reference Notes along with added FAQs. An important feature is that the Global JXDM, Version 3.0.3, is forward compatible with all XML instances written for Global JXDM, Version 3.0. Global JXDM, Version 3.0, instances validate with all 3.0.3 schemas and schema subsets. Global JXDM, Versions 3.0.2 and 3.0, will remain available indefinitely. For a list of specific updates, refer to the Global JXDM Change Log. Since its first prerelease in April 2003, the Global JXDM has continued to undergo intensive reviews, receive feedback and error reports online from the public, and provide a Global JXDM Listserv discussion forum for sharing expertise and support. Today, more than 50 law enforcement and justice-related projects have been implemented utilizing the Global JXDM, further demonstrating the flexibility and stability of the Global JXDM. The Global JXDM, Version 3.0.3 Global Justice XML Data Dictionary (Global JXDD) types and properties are rendered as XML Schema types, elements, and attributes. Also included are the most current enumeration type schemas (code tables) and their proxy schemas. Version 3.0.3 is compatible with Versions 3.0.2 and 3.0.

His Chinesische Grammatik (1881), according to a critic, \\"remains until today recognized as probably the finest overall grammatical survey of the Classical Chinese language to date.\\" (Harbsmeier 1995:333) Gabelentz was born in Poschwitz, near Altenburg, Saxe- Altenburg. His father was the more renowned minister and linguist Hans Conon von der Gabelentz, an authority of the Manchu language. Gabelentz taught himself Dutch, Italian and Chinese during his gymnasium years. From 1860 to 1864, following his father's steps, he studied law, administration, and linguistics at Jena. In 1864 he entered the civil service of Saxony at Dresden. He continued his study of oriental languages at Leipzig. He married Alexandra von Rothkirch in 1872. His father Hans died at the family castle of Lemnitz in 1874. Gabelentz earned his doctoral from Dresden in 1876 with a translation of Zhou Dunyi's Taiji Tushuo (Â§™Ê•µÂúñË™™ \\"Explaining taiji\\"). In 1878, a Professorship of Far Eastern Languages, the first of its kind in the German- speaking world, was created at the University of Leipzig, and Gabelentz was invited to fill it. Among his students were the German sinologists Wilhelm Grube (1855‚Äì1908) and Johann Jakob Maria de Groot (1854‚Äì1921), the Austrian Sinologist Arthur von Rosthorn (1862‚Äì1945), the Japanologist Karl Florenz (1865‚Äì1939), the archaeologist Max Uhle (1856‚Äì1944), the Tibetologist Heinrich Wenzel and the art historian Friedrich Wilhelm Karl M√ºller (1863‚Äì1930). In 1889, he divorced, and switched to the University of Berlin. In 1891, he remarried, and published Die Sprachwissenschaft (\\"Linguistics\\"). His Handbuch zur Aufnahme fremder Sprachen followed one year later. Gabelentz criticized the Beijing dialect which dominated the linguistic scene in China. A more suitable Chinese dialect in Gabelentz's view for science was the Nanjing dialect rather than Beijing. > Only in recent times has the northern dialect, pek-kuƒÅn-ho√°, in the form > [spoken] in the capital, kƒ´ng-ho√°, begun to strive for general acceptance, > and the struggle seems to be decided in its favor.

It is noted for the russet-red fall color of its lacy needles. This plant has some cultivated varietiesFarjon, A. (2005). Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. and is often used in groupings in public spaces. Common names include bald cypress, baldcypress, swamp cypress, white cypress, tidewater red cypress, gulf cypress and red cypress. Description Cypress grove in winter Taxodium distichum is a large, slow- growing, and long-lived tree. It typically grows to heights of and has a trunk diameter of . The main trunk is often surrounded by cypress knees. The bark is grayish brown to reddish brown, thin, and fibrous with a stringy texture; it has a vertically, interwoven pattern of shallow ridges and narrow furrows. The needle-like leaves are long and are simple, alternate, green and linear, with entire margins. In autumn, the leaves turn yellow or copper red. The bald cypress drops its needles each winter and then grows a new set in spring. This species is monoecious, with male and female flowers on a single plant forming on slender, tassel-like structures near the edge of branchlets. The tree flowers in April and the seeds ripen in October. The male and female strobili are produced from buds formed in late autumn, with pollination in early winter, and mature in about 12 months. Male cones emerge on panicles that are inches long. Female cones are round, resinous and green while young. They then turn hard and then brown as the tree matures. They are globular and in diameter. They have from 20 to 30 spirally arranged, four-sided scales, each bearing one, two, or rarely three triangular seeds. Each cone contains 20 to 40 large seeds. The cones disintegrate at maturity to release the seeds. The seeds are long, the largest of any species of Cupressaceae, and are produced every year, with heavy crops every 3‚Äì5 years. The seedlings have three to nine, but usually six, cotyledons each. The bald cypress grows in full sunlight to partial shade. This species grows best in wet or well-drained soil but can tolerate dry soil. It is moderately able to grow in aerosols of salt water. It does well in acid, neutral and alkaline soils across the full range of light (sandy), medium (loamy), and heavy (clay) soils. It can also grow in saline soils. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution. The cones are often consumed by wildlife. The tallest known specimen, near Williamsburg, Virginia, is 44.11 m (145 ft) tall, and the stoutest known, in the Real County near Leaky, Texas, has a diameter at breast height of 475 in (39 ft). The National Champion Bald Cypress is recognized as the largest member of its species in the country and is listed as such on the National Register of Champion Trees by American Forest. The National Champion Bald Cypress is in the Cat Island Nation Wildlife Refuge, near St. Francisville, Louisiana, and it is 96 feet tall, 56 feet in circumference, and is estimated to be approximately 1,500 years old. The oldest known living specimen, found along the Black River in North Carolina, is at least 2,624 years old, rendering it the oldest living tree in eastern North America.

Croom. It differs in shorter leaves borne on erect shoots, and in ecology, being largely confined to low-nutrient blackwater habitats. A few authors also treat Taxodium mucronatum as a variety of bald cypress, as T. distichum var. mexicanum Gordon, thereby considering the genus as comprising only one species. Habitat Bald cypress in Trap Pond State Park, Delaware = Range = Bald cypress on the Texas side of Caddo Lake The native range extends from southeastern New Jersey south to Florida and west to East Texas and southeastern Oklahoma, and also inland up the Mississippi River. Ancient bald cypress forests, with some trees more than 1,700 years old, once dominated swamps in the Southeast. The range had been believed to extended north only as far as Delaware, but researchers have now found a natural forest on the Cape May Peninsula in southern New Jersey. The species can also be found growing outside its natural native range. The largest remaining old-growth stands are at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, near Naples, Florida, and in the Three Sisters tract along eastern North Carolina's Black River. The Corkscrew trees are around 500 years of age, and some exceed 40 m in height. The Black River trees were cored by dendrochronologist David Stahle from the University of Arkansas. He found that some began growing as early as 364 AD. Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) growing near the western extreme of its range on the Guadalupe River in the semi-arid Edwards Plateau, Kerr County, Texas, USA (14 April 2012). This species is native to humid climates where annual precipitation ranges from about in Texas to along the Gulf Coast. Although it grows best in warm climates, the natural northern limit of the species is not due to a lack of cold tolerance, but to specific reproductive requirements: further north, regeneration is prevented by ice damage to seedlings. Larger trees are able to tolerate much lower temperatures and lower humidity. In 2012 scuba divers discovered an underwater cypress forest several miles off the coast of Mobile, Alabama, in 60 feet of water. The forest contains trees that could not be dated with radiocarbon methods, indicating that they are more than 50,000 years old and thus most likely lived in the early glacial interval of the last ice age. The cypress forest is well preserved, and when samples are cut they still smell like fresh cypress. A team, which has not yet published its results in a peer-reviewed journal, is studying the site. One possibility is that hurricane Katrina exposed the grove of bald cypress, which had been protected under ocean floor sediments. Reproduction and early growth Foliage in autumn just before shedding The bald cypress is monoecious. Male and female strobili mature in one growing season from buds formed the previous year. The male catkins are about in diameter and are borne in slender, purplish, drooping clusters long that are conspicuous during the winter on this deciduous conifer. Pollen is shed in March and April. Female conelets are found singly or in clusters of two or three. The globose cones turn from green to brownish-purple as they mature from October to December. The cones are in diameter and consist of 9 to 15 four-sided scales that break away irregularly after maturity. Each scale can bear two (rarely three) irregular, triangular seeds with thick, horny, warty coats and projecting flanges.Faulkner, Stephen P. 1982.

Cleaned seeds number from about 5,600 to 18,430 per kg (2,540 to 8,360 per lb). =Seed production and dissemination= Some seeds are produced every year, and good seed crops occur at three- to five-year intervals. At maturity, the cone scales with their resin-coated seeds adhering to them, or sometimes entire cones, drop to the water or ground.Stubbs, Jack. 1983. Personal communication. USDA Forest Service, Southeastern Forest Experiment Station, Clemson, SC. This drop of mature seeds is often hastened by squirrels, which eat bald cypress seeds, but usually drop several scales with undamaged seeds still attached to each cone they pick.Brunswig, Norman L. 1983. Personal communication. National Audubon Society, Francis Beidler Forest, Harleyville, SC. Floodwaters spread the scales or cones along streams and are the most important means of seed dissemination. =Seedling development= Germination is epigeal. Under swamp conditions, germination generally takes place on a sphagnum moss or a wet-muck seedbed. Seeds will not germinate under water, but some will remain viable for 30 months under water. By contrast, seeds usually fail to germinate on better drained soils because of the lack of surface water. Thus, a soil saturated but not flooded for a period of one to three months after seedfall is required for germination. Bald cypress swamp and Spanish moss at First Landing State Park in Virginia Beach, VA After germination, seedlings must grow fast enough to keep at least part of their crowns above floodwaters for most of the growing season.Conner, William H, 1988, Natural and artificial regeneration of baldcypress [Taxodium distichum (L.)

Cypress planting in southern Louisiana. Southern Lumberman 179(2249):227-230. Growth is checked when a seedling is completely submerged by flooding, and prolonged submergence kills the seedling. In nurseries, Taxodium seeds show an apparent internal dormancy that can be overcome by various treatments, usually including cold stratification or submerging in water for 60 days. Nursery beds are sown in spring with pretreated seeds or in fall with untreated seeds. Seedlings usually reach in height during their first (and usually only) year in the nursery. Average size of 1-0 nursery-grown seedlings in a seed source test including 72 families was tall and in diameter. Control of competing vegetation may be necessary for a year or more for bald cypress planted outside of swamps. Five years after planting on a harrowed and bedded, poorly drained site in Florida, survival was high, but heights had increased only , probably because of heavy herbaceous competition. Seedlings grown in a crawfish pond in Louisiana, where weed control and soil moisture were excellent through June, averaged and diameter at breast heigh after five years. However, a replicate of the same sources planted in an old soybean field, where weed control and soil moisture were poor, resulted in the same diameter, but a smaller average seedling height of . When planted in a residential yard and weeded and watered, they averaged tall three years later. =Vegetative reproduction= Bald cypress is one of the few conifer species that sprouts. Thrifty sprouts are generally produced from stumps of young trees, but trees up to 60 years old also send up healthy sprouts if the trees are cut during the fall or winter. However, survival of these sprouts is often poor, and those that live are usually poorly shaped and do not make quality sawtimber trees. Stumps of trees up to 200 years old may also sprout, but the sprouts are not as vigorous and are more subject to wind damage as the stump decays. In the only report on the rooting of bald cypress cuttings found in the literature, cuttings from trees five years old rooted better than those from older trees. Ecology A bald cypress in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana Bald cypress knees in duckweed The seeds remain viable for less than one year, and are dispersed in two ways. One is by water: the seeds float and move on water until flooding recedes or the cone is deposited on shore. The second is by wildlife: squirrels eat seeds, but often drop some scales from the cones they harvest. Seeds do not germinate under water and rarely germinate on well-drained soils; seedlings normally become established on continuously saturated, but not flooded, soils for one to three months. After germination, seedlings must grow quickly to escape floodwaters; they often reach a height of 20‚Äì75 cm (up to 100 cm in fertilized nursery conditions) in their first year. Seedlings die if inundated for more than about two to four weeks. Natural regeneration is therefore prevented on sites that are always flooded during the growing season. Although vigorous saplings and stump sprouts can produce viable seed, most specimens do not produce seed until they are about 30 years old. In good conditions, bald cypress grows fairly fast when young, then more slowly with age. Trees have been measured to reach 3 m in five years, 21 m in 41 years, and 36 m in height in 96 years; height growth has largely ceased by the time the trees are 200 years old. Some individuals can live over 1,000 years. Determination of the age of an old tree may be difficult because of frequent missing or false rings of stemwood caused by variable and stressful growing environments. Bald cypress forest in winter, showing \\"knees\\" and (brown) high flood level, Lynches River, Johnsonville, South Carolina Bald cypress trees growing in swamps have a peculiarity of growth called cypress knees. These are woody projections from the root system project above the ground or water. Their function was once thought to be to provide oxygen to the roots, which grow in the low dissolved oxygen waters typical of a swamp (as in mangroves). However, evidence for this is scant; in fact, roots of swamp-dwelling specimens whose knees are removed do not decrease in oxygen content and the trees continue to thrive. Another more likely function is structural support and stabilization. Bald cypress trees growing on flood-prone sites tend to form buttressed bases, but trees grown on drier sites may lack this feature. Buttressed bases and a strong, intertwined root system allow them to resist very strong winds; even hurricanes rarely overturn them. Many agents damage T. distichum trees. The main damaging (in some cases lethal) agent is the fungus Lauriliella taxodii, which causes a brown pocket rot known as \\"pecky cypress.\\" It attacks the heartwood of living trees, usually from the crown down to the roots. A few other fungi attack the sapwood and the heartwood of the tree, but they do not usually cause serious damage. Insects such as the cypress flea beetle (Systena marginalis) and the bald cypress leafroller (Archips goyerana) can seriously damage trees by destroying leaves, cones or bark. Nutrias also clip and unroot young bald cypress seedlings, sometimes killing a whole plantation in a short amount of time. Conservation In 2002, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources identified T. distichum as a state protected plant with the status of Threatened. Globally, the species is listed as of Least Concern by the IUCN. Cultivation and uses Timber The bald cypress is hardy and can be planted in hardiness zones 4 through 10 in the US. The species is a popular ornamental tree that is cultivated for its light, feathery foliage and orangey brown to dull red autumnal color. In cultivation it thrives on a wide range of soils, including well-drained sites where it would not grow naturally because juvenile seedlings cannot compete with other vegetation. Cultivation is successful far north of its native range, even to southern Canada. It is also commonly planted in Europe, Asia, and other temperate and subtropical locales. It does, however, require hot summers for good growth. When planted in locales with the cool summers of oceanic climates, growth is healthy but very slow; some specimens in northeastern England have only grown to 4‚Äì5 m tall in 50 yearsTree Register of the British Isles and do not produce cones. One of the oldest specimens in Europe was planted in the 1900s in the Arboretum de P√©zanin in Burgundy, France. Bald cypress has great merchantable yields. In virgin stands, yields from 112 to 196 m¬≥/ha were common, and some stands may have exceeded 1,000 m¬≥/ha. The lumber is valuable for building construction, fence posts, planking in boats, river pilings, doors, blinds, flooring, shingles, garden boxes, caskets, interior trim and cabinetry. The odorless wood, which closely resembles that of other Cupressus species, has long been valued for its resistance to water. Still usable prehistoric wood is often found in swamps as far north as New Jersey, and occasionally as far north as Connecticut, although it is more common in the southeastern states. This partially mineralized wood is harvested from swamps in the southeastern states, and is greatly prized for special uses such as for carvings. The fungus Lauriliella taxodii causes a specific form of the wood called \\"pecky cypress\\", which is used for decorative wall paneling. The bald cypress was designated the official state tree of Louisiana in 1963. Some consider it to be a symbol of the southern swamps of the United States. The bald cypress was used by Native Americans to create coffins, homes, drums and canoes. Joshua D. Brown, the first settler of Kerrville, Texas, made his living producing shingles from bald cypress trees that grew along the Guadalupe River of the Texas Hill Country.Texas Historical Commission, historical marker in Kerrville, Texas, 1971. Beginning in the early 1990s, the bald cypress was harvested heavily to make paneling, mulch and shingles.

The fort was commissioned in the summer of 1862 to protect the Overland Trail from attacks by Native Americans in a conflict that later became known as the Colorado War. Located along the Cache la Poudre River in Larimer County, it was relocated from its initial location near Laporte after a devastating flood. Its second location downstream on the Poudre was used until 1866 and became the nucleus around which the City of Fort Collins was founded. History =Laporte location (1862‚Äì1864)= The camp was commissioned on July 22, 1862 and later named for Lt. Col. William O. Collins, colonel of the 11th Ohio Cavalry and the commandant of Fort Laramie, the headquarters of the U.S. Army's West Sub-district of the District of Nebraska. The initial camp at Laporte was constructed and manned by Company B, 9th Kansas Cavalry. The mission of the fort was to protect the emigrant trains and Overland Stage lines on the Overland Trail from the growing hostile attacks of the Plains Indians. The growing hostility of the Lakota to white encroachment further north had forced the temporary relocation of the Emigrant Trail from the North Platte River to the South Platte valley. Although relations with the Arapaho and Cheyenne in the vicinity of the camp were largely peaceful, the hostility of the Pawnee and other tribes on the Colorado Eastern Plains towards white settlement prompted the Army to establish the fort as a precautionary measure to protect the trail. The camp was founded near the existing settlement of Laporte (originally Colona) that had been founded four years earlier in 1858 by Antoine Janis and other homesteaders from Fort Laramie. Although the region was not part of the Colorado Gold Rush that erupted the following year, the fertile lands of the Colorado Piedmont along the Poudre attracted a growing number of homesteaders in the mid-1860s. The Arapaho continued to live in villages along the Poudre near the mountains, coexisting peacefully with the settlers, despite the loss of their hunting grounds on the eastern plains in 1861 by treaty with the U.S. government. During its first two years, the fort remained a somewhat peaceful outpost. The fort saw little direct action during its commission and was never stockaded with walls. In the fall of 1862, the 9th Kansas Cavalry was relieved by a detachment of the 1st Colorado Volunteer Cavalry under Captain David L. Hardy. The following July 1863, Hardy and Company M left the fort to pursue hostile Utes in the mountains, leaving the camp in control of Company B of the 1st Colorado under Lt. George W. Hawkins. In April 1864, Company B was ordered to Camp Sanborn to bolster the garrison there, leaving a void that was filled in mid-May 1864 by the arrival of Company F of the 11th Ohio Cavalry, commanded by William H. Evans. The most significant event its history occurred within a month after the arrival of the 11th Ohio. The event was not a battle but the flooding on the Poudre River, swollen from spring snow melt, in early June 1864. The flood destroyed the camp nearly completely, with many of the soldiers barely escaping with their lives. =Poudre location (1864‚Äì1867)= The obvious unsuitability of the site for future use prompted Evans to order Lieutenant Joseph Hannah to begin scouting for an alternative site. Joseph Mason, a local settler, came forth with a proposal for a new site adjacent to his own claim four miles downstream on the Poudre, on a section of high ground on the south bank of the river. The site offered protection from flooding, had a prominent viewshed of the terrain, and was directly on the \\"Denver Road\\", the section of the Overland Trail through the county. The site offered the additional benefit of being removed from the saloons and other temptations in Laporte. On August 20, 1864, Colonel Collins issued Special Order No. 1 relocating the camp to the site suggested by Mason. The new post, by then known as \\"Fort Collins\\", was fully occupied by October 22 and the Laporte site was completely abandoned. The new site saw as little direct action as the original site, but its proximity to the growing community of new homesteaders, as well as its location on the Denver Road, made it increasingly the center of local transportation and commerce. The site itself is in present-day Old Town in Fort Collins, between Jefferson Street (the old Denver Road) and the Poudre River. The actual military reservation encompassed an expansive territory that stretches several miles south of the Poudre, but the actual campgrounds were confined to a small area in present-day Old Town. The 300 foot square parade ground, standard for forts of its type, was centered at the present intersection of Willow and Linden Streets, approximately one block from the river. The site included the standard configuration of barracks and mess halls for enlisted men, an officer's quarters, camp headquarters, guard houses, storehouses, and stables. The buildings were of log construction typically for that era and region. A city-authorized sign near the intersection provides a guide to the location of the original camp buildings, none of which survive today. The first commercial buildings were built on the southwest side of the Denver Road (Jefferson Street), including the two-story inn owned by early settler \\"Auntie\\" Elizabeth Stone. The structure was relocated in the 20th century to the grounds of the Fort Collins Museum. The subsiding of the conflict with Native Americans, in particular their complete removal from the Colorado Territory after 1865, increasingly made the fort irrelevant. In September 1866 the post was completely abandoned and was officially decommissioned the following year by order of General William T. Sherman. =Site of the town of Fort Collins= Almost immediately, local business owners and residents stepped into the vacuum left by the abandonment, claiming the land for commercial purposes, despite a clerical error by the Army that kept the land officially in government hands until 1872. By 1869, Stone and Henry C. Peterson constructed the first flour mill on the south bank of the Poudre, as well as 1.5-mile (2.5 km) mill race to supply water power. The first white child in Fort Collins, Agnes Mason, was born in the former camp headquarters on October 31, 1867. In 1870 the Colorado Territorial Legislature designated the fledgling town as the location for the Agricultural College (present-day Colorado State University). The military reservation was officially relinquished on May 15, 1872 by presidential order, officially opening the land to settlement claims. The townsite of Fort Collins was officially platted on the former site of the camp in January 1873. The original plat includes all the \\"tilted\\" streets in present-day Old Town north of Mountain Avenue and east of College Avenue. The town grew rapidly as an agricultural center in the 1870s, and the town plat was rapidly expanded by the founding of the Fort Collins Agricultural Colony in 1873.

The brief engagement was a Confederate delaying action that allowed General Joseph E. Johnston to bait a trap for the Union army at Cassville. Prelude Following the Battle of Resaca, May 13-15, General Joseph E. Johnston's army retreated southward while Major General William Tecumseh Sherman pursued. Failing to find a good defensive position south of Calhoun, Georgia, Johnston continued to Adairsville, while the Confederate cavalry fought a skillful rearguard action and kept Sherman away from Atlanta. The battle Once across the Oostanaula River, Johnston sought to make a stand and draw the Federals into a costly assault. He expected to find favorable terrain near Calhoun, but in this he was disappointed and during the night of May 16-17 he led the Confederates southward toward Adairsville. Sherman followed, dividing his forces into three columns, and advancing on a broad front. There were skirmishes all along the route, but the main bodies were not engaged. Two miles north of Adairsville Oliver Otis Howard and the Union IV Corps began skirmishing with entrenched units of William J. Hardee's Confederate corps. The 44th Illinois and 24th Wisconsin infantry regiments led by Maj. Arthur MacArthur, Jr. (father of Douglas MacArthur) attacked Benjamin F. Cheatham's division and suffered heavy losses. The rest of Howard's corps prepared for battle but further attacks were called off by General Thomas. At Adairsville, Johnston again hoped to find a position in which he could give battle but there too the terrain was unsuitable for further defense and the Confederate commander was forced to continue his withdrawal. As he fell back, however, Johnston devised a strategy that he hoped would lead to the destruction of a part of Sherman's forces. There were two roads leading south from Adairsville --one south to Kingston, the other southeast to Cassville. It seemed likely that Sherman would divide his armies so as to use both roads. This would give Johnston the opportunity to attack one column before the other could come to its aid. When the Southerners abandoned Adairsville during the night of May 17-18, Johnston sent William J. Hardee's Corps to Kingston, while he fell back toward Cassville with the rest of his army. He hoped that Sherman would believe most of the Southerners to be in Kingston and concentrate the bulk of his forces there. Hardee would then hold off the Northerners at Kingston while Johnston, with Leonidas Polk and John Bell Hood, destroyed the smaller Federal column at Cassville. Sherman reacted as Johnston hoped, ordering James B. McPherson and the bulk of George Henry Thomas's army toward Kingston while sending only John Schofield and one corps of Thomas' army along the road to Cassville. On the morning of May 19, Johnston ordered Hood to march along a country road a mile or so east of the Adairsville-Cassville Road and form his corps for battle facing west. While Polk attacked the head of the Federal column, Hood was to assail its left flank. As Hood was moving into position, he ran into Daniel Butterfield's Federal brigade to the east. This was a source of great danger, for had Hood formed facing west, these Federals would have been in position to attack the exposed flank and rear of his corps. After a brief skirmish with the Northerners, Hood fell back to rejoin Polk. Johnston, believing that the opportunity for a successful battle had passed, ordered Hood and Polk to move to a new line east and south of Cassville, where they were joined by Hardee who had been pushed out of Kingston. Johnston formed his army on a ridge and hoped that Sherman would attack him there on May 20. As usual, the Southern commander was confident of repulsing the enemy. During the night, the Confederates withdrew across the Etowah River. As they fell back, their feelings were mixed. They had lost a very strong position at Dalton, and had fallen back from Resaca, Calhoun, and Adairsville. Now they were retreating again under cover of darkness. That morning as they prepared for battle, their spirits had been high. Now their disappointment was bitter. Although morale would revive in the next few days, many Southern soldiers would never again place as much confidence in Johnston's abilities as they once had. Aftermath That night the Confederate leaders held a council of war. Exactly what happened at the council is a matter of dispute. According to Johnston, Polk and Hood reported that their lines could not be held and urged that the army retreat. Believing that the fears of the corps commanders would be communicated to their men and thus weaken the army's confidence, Johnston yielded to these demands, even though he thought the position to be defensible. According to Hood, whose recollection of the council differs markedly from Johnston's, he and Polk told Johnston that the line could not be held against an attack but that it was a good position from which to move against the enemy. Johnston, however, was unwilling to risk an offensive battle and decided to fall back across the Etowah. No definite resolution of this dispute is possible, but most of the available evidence, including a post-war letter to Union General Butterfield, supports Hood's version of the conference. Certainly Johnston was not required to allow the advice of subordinates to overrule his own judgment. The responsibility for abandoning the Cassville position rests on the Southern commander.

This bacterium, along with the closely related species Streptococcus sobrinus, can cohabit the mouth: Both contribute to oral disease, and the expense of differentiating them in laboratory testing is often not clinically necessary. Therefore, for clinical purposes they are often considered together as a group, called the mutans streptococci (plural, non-italic due to it being an informal group name). This grouping of similar bacteria with similar tropism can also be seen in the viridans streptococci, another group of Streptococcus species. Ecology S. mutans is naturally present in the human oral microbiota, along with at least 25 other species of oral streptococci. The taxonomy of these bacteria remains tentative. Different areas of the oral cavity present different ecological niches, and each species has specific properties for colonizing different oral sites. S. mutans is most prevalent on the pits and fissures, constituting 39% of the total streptococci in the oral cavity. Fewer S. mutans bacteria are found on the buccal surface (2‚Äì9%). Bacterial-fungal co-coaggregation can help to increase the cariogenic potential of S.mutans. A symbiotic relationship with S.mutans and Candida Albicans leads to increased glucan production and increased biofilm formation. This therefore amplifies the cariogenic effect of S.mutans. Oral streptococci have both harmless and harmful bacteria. However, under special conditions commensal streptococci can become opportunistic pathogens, initiating disease and damaging the host. Imbalances in the microbial biota can initiate oral diseases. Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast that can be found within the oral cavity. Its presence in the biofilm promotes higher levels of Streptococcus mutans when looking at early childhood caries. It stimulates the formation of S. mutans microcolonies.This is achieved through low concentrations of cross-kingdom metabolites, such as farnesol, derived from the biofilm. It has been suggested that when both microbes are present, more biofilm matrix is produced, with a greater density.When farnesol is in high concentration, it inhibits the growth of both S. mutans and C. albicans. This decreases the biofilm pathogenesis, and therefore its caries promoting potential. This offers the potential for an anti-fungal to be used in the prevention of dental caries. Role in disease =Tooth decay= Early colonizers of the tooth surface are mainly Neisseria spp. and streptococci, including S. mutans. They must withstand the oral cleansing forces (e.g. saliva and the tongue movements) and adhere sufficiently to the dental hard tissues. The growth and metabolism of these pioneer species changes local environmental conditions (e.g., Eh, pH, coaggregation, and substrate availability), thereby enabling more fastidious organisms to further colonize after them, forming dental plaque. Along with S. sobrinus, S. mutans plays a major role in tooth decay, metabolizing sucrose to lactic acid. The acidic environment created in the mouth by this process is what causes the highly mineralized tooth enamel to be vulnerable to decay. S. mutans is one of a few specialized organisms equipped with receptors that improve adhesion to the surface of teeth. S. mutans uses the enzyme glucansucrase to convert sucrose into a sticky, extracellular, dextran-based polysaccharide that allows them to cohere, forming plaque. S. mutans produces dextran via the enzyme dextransucrase (a hexosyltransferase) using sucrose as a substrate in the following reaction: : n sucrose -> (glucose)n \\\\+ n fructose Sucrose is the only sugar that bacteria can use to form this sticky polysaccharide. However, other sugars‚Äîglucose, fructose, lactose‚Äîcan also be digested by S. mutans, but they produce lactic acid as an end product. The combination of plaque and acid leads to dental decay. Due to the role S. mutans plays in tooth decay, many attempts have been made to create a vaccine for the organism. So far, such vaccines have not been successful in humans. Recently, proteins involved in the colonization of teeth by S. mutans have been shown to produce antibodies that inhibit the cariogenic process. A molecule recently synthesized at Yale University and the University of Chile, called Keep 32, is supposed to be able to kill S. mutans. Another candidate is a peptide called C16G2, synthesised at UCLA. It is believed that Streptococcus mutans acquired the gene that enables it to produce biofilms through horizontal gene transfer with other lactic acid bacterial species, such as Lactobacillus. =Life in the oral cavity= Surviving in the oral cavity, S. mutans is the primary causal agent and the pathogenic species responsible for dental caries (tooth decay or cavities) specifically in the initiation and development stages. Dental plaque, typically the precursor to tooth decay, contains more than 600 different microorganisms, contributing to the oral cavity's overall dynamic environment that frequently undergoes rapid changes in pH, nutrient availability, and oxygen tension. Dental plaque adheres to the teeth and consists of bacterial cells, while plaque is the biofilm on the surfaces of the teeth. Dental plaque and S. mutans is frequently exposed to \\"toxic compounds\\" from oral healthcare products, food additives, and tobacco. While S. mutans grows in the biofilm, cells maintain a balance of metabolism that involves production and detoxification. Biofilm is an aggregate of microorganisms in which cells adhere to each other or a surface. Bacteria in the biofilm community can actually generate various toxic compounds that interfere with the growth of other competing bacteria. S. mutans has over time developed strategies to successfully colonize and maintain a dominant presence in the oral cavity. The oral biofilm is continuously challenged by changes in the environmental conditions. In response to such changes, the bacterial community evolved with individual members and their specific functions to survive in the oral cavity. S. mutans has been able to evolve from nutrition-limiting conditions to protect itself in extreme conditions. Streptococci represent 20% of the oral bacteria and actually determine the development of the biofilms. Although S. mutans can be antagonized by pioneer colonizers, once they become dominant in oral biofilms, dental caries can develop and thrive. =Cariogenic potential= The causative agent of dental caries is associated with its ability to metabolize various sugars, form a robust biofilm, produce an abundant amount of lactic acid, and thrive in the acid environment it generates. A study into pH of plaque said that the critical pH for increased demineralisation of dental hard tissues (enamel and dentine) is 5.5. The Stephan curve illustrates how quickly the plaque pH can fall below 5.5 after a snack or meal. Dental caries is a dental biofilm-related oral disease associated with increased consumption of dietary sugar and fermentable carbohydrates. When dental biofilms remain on tooth surfaces, along with frequent exposure to sugars, acidogenic bacteria (members of dental biofilms) will metabolize the sugars to organic acids. Untreated dental caries is the most common disease affecting humans worldwide . Persistence of this acidic condition encourages the proliferation of acidogenic and aciduric bacteria as a result of their ability to survive at a low-pH environment. The low-pH environment in the biofilm matrix erodes the surface of the teeth and begins the \\"initiation\\" of the dental caries. Streptococcus mutans is a bacterium which is prevalent within the oral environment and is thought to be a vital microorganism that contributes to this initiation. S. mutans thrives in acidic conditions, becoming the main bacterium in cultures with permanently reduced pH . If the adherence of S. mutans to the surface of teeth or the physiological ability (acidogenity and aciduricity) of S. mutans in dental biofilms can be reduced or eliminated, the acidification potential of dental biofilms and later cavity formations can be decreased. Ideally, we can stop the early various lesion developing beyond the white spot stage. Once beyond here, the enamel surface is irreversibly damaged and cannot be biologically repaired. In young children, the pain from a carious lesion can be quite distressing and restorative treatment can cause an early dental anxiety to develop. Dental anxiety has knock-on effects for both dental professionals and patients. Treatment planning and therefore treatment success can be compromised. The dental staff can become stressed and frustrated when working with anxious children. This can compromise their relationship with the child and their parents. Studies have shown a cycle to exist, whereby dentally anxious patients avoid caring for the health of their oral tissues. They can sometimes avoid oral hygiene and will try to avoid seeking dental care until the pain is unbearable. Susceptibility to disease varies between individuals and immunological mechanisms have been proposed to confer protection or susceptibility to the disease. These mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated but it seems that while antigen presenting cells are activated by S. mutans in vitro, they fail to respond in vivo. Immunological tolerance to S. mutans at the mucosal surface may make individuals more prone to colonisation with S. mutans and therefore increase susceptibility to dental caries. =In children= S. mutans is often acquired in the oral cavity subsequent to tooth eruption, but has also been detected in the oral cavity of predentate children. It is generally, but not exclusively, transmitted via vertical transmission from caregiver (generally the mother) to child. This can also commonly happen when the parent puts their lips to the child's bottle to taste it, or to clean the child's pacifier, then puts it into the child's mouth. =Cardiovascular disease= S. mutans is implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cardiovascular diseases, and is the most prevalent bacterial species detected in extirpated heart valve tissues, as well as in atheromatous plaques, with an incidence of 68.6% and 74.1%, respectively. Streptococcus sanguinis, closely related to S. mutans and also found in the oral cavity, has been shown to cause Infective Endocarditis. Streptococcus mutans has been associated with bacteraemia and infective endocarditis (IE). IE is divided into acute and subacute forms, and the bacterium is isolated in subacute cases. The common symptoms are: fever, chills, sweats, anorexia, weight loss, and malaise. S. mutans has been classified into four serotypes; c, e, f, and k. The classification of the serotypes is devised from the chemical composition of the serotype-specific rhamnose-glucose polymers. For example, serotype k initially found in blood isolates has a large reduction of glucose side chains attached to the rhamnose backbone. S. mutans has the following surface protein antigens: glucosyltransferases, protein antigen and glucan-binding proteins. If these surface protein antigens are not present, then the bacteria is a protein antigen-defective mutant with the least susceptibility to phagocytosis therefore causing the least harm to cells. Furthermore, rat experiments showed that infection with such defective streptococcus mutants (S. mutans strains without glucosyltransferases isolated from a destroyed heart valve of an infective endocarditis patient) resulted in a longer duration of bacteraemia. The results demonstrate that the virulence of infective endocarditis caused by S. mutans is linked to the specific cell surface components present. In addition, S. mutans DNA has been found in cardiovascular specimens at a higher ratio than other periodontal bacteria. This highlights its possible involvement in a variety of types of cardiovascular diseases, not just confined to bacteraemia and infective endocarditis. Prevention and treatment Practice of good oral hygiene including daily brushing, flossing and the use of appropriate mouthwash can significantly reduce the number of oral bacteria, including S. mutans and inhibit their proliferation. S. mutans often live in dental plaque, hence mechanical removal of plaque is an effective way of getting rid of them. The best toothbrushing technique to reduce plaque build up, decreasing caries risk, is the modified Bass technique. Brushing twice daily can help decrease the caries risk. However, there are some remedies used in the treatment of oral bacterial infection, in conjunction with mechanical cleaning. These include fluoride, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the enolase enzyme, as well as chlorhexidine, which works presumably by interfering with bacterial adherence. Furthermore, fluoride ions can be detrimental to bacterial cell metabolism. Fluoride directly inhibits glycolytic enzymes and H+ATPases. Fluoride ions also lower the pH of the cytoplasm. This means there will be less acid produced during the bacterial glycolysis. Therefore, fluoride mouthwashes, toothpastes, gels and varnishes can help to reduce the prevalence of caries. However, findings from investigations into the effect of fluoride-containing varnish, on the level of Streptococcus mutans in the oral environment in children suggest that the reduction of caries cannot be explained by a reduction in the level of Streptococcus mutans in saliva or dental plaque Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Effect of a fluoride-containing varnish on Streptococcus mutans in plaque and saliva, Scandinavian journal of dental research, 1982, 90(6), 2003 Issue 3 - Zickert I, Emilson CG. Fluoride varnish treatment with or without prior dental hygiene has no significant effect on the plaque and salivary levels of S. mutans Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventative Dentistry, Effect of three different compositions of topical fluoride varnishes with and without prior oral prophylaxis on Streptococcus mutans count in biofilm samples of children aged 2‚Äì8 years: A randomized controlled trial, 2019, Page: 286-291 - Sushma Yadav, Vinod Sachdev, Manvi Malik, Radhika Chopra. S. mutans secretes Glucosyltransferase on its cell wall, which allows the bacteria to produce polysaccharides from sucrose. These sticky polysaccharides are responsible for the bacteria's ability to aggregate with one another and adhere to tooth enamel, i.e. to form biofilms. Use of Anti Cell-Associated Glucosyltransferase (Anti-CA-gtf) Immunoglobulin Y disrupts S. mutans' ability to adhere to the teeth enamel, thus preventing it from reproducing. Studies have shown that Anti-CA-gtf IgY is able to effectively and specifically suppress S. mutans in the oral cavity. Other common preventative measures center on reducing sugar intake. One way this is done is with sugar replacements such as xylitol or erythritol which cannot be metabolized into sugars which normally enhance S. mutans growth. The molecule xylitol, a 5 carbon sugar, disrupts the energy production of S.mutans by forming a toxic intermediate during glycolysis. Various other natural remedies have been suggested or studied to a degree, including deglycyrrhizinated licorice root extract, tea tree oil, macelignan (found in nutmeg), curcuminoids (the main components of turmeric), and eugenol (found in bay leaves, cinnamon leaves and cloves). Additionally various teas have been tested for activity against S. mutans and other dental benefits. However, none of these remedies have been subject to clinical trials or are recommended by mainstream dental health groups to treat S. mutans. The addition of bioactive glass beads to dental composites reduces penetration of Streptococcus mutans into the marginal gaps between tooth and composite. They have antimicrobial properties, reducing bacterial penetration. This decreases the risk of secondary caries developing, a common reason for failure of dental restorations. This means that the longevity and efficacy of composite restorations may be improved. Survival under stressful conditions Conditions in the oral cavity are diverse and complex, frequently changing from one extreme to another. Thus, to survive in the oral cavity, S. mutans must tolerate rapidly harsh environmental fluctuations and exposure to various antimicrobial agents to survive. Transformation is a bacterial adaptation involving the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through the surrounding medium. Transformation is a primitive form of sexual reproduction. For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state termed ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù. In S. mutans, a peptide pheromone quorum-sensing signaling system controls genetic competence. This system functions optimally when the S. mutans cells are in crowded biofilms. S. mutans cells growing in a biofilm are transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than single cells growing under uncrowded conditions (planktonic cells). Induction of competence appears to be an adaptation for repairing DNA damage caused by crowded, stressful conditions. as PDF Knowing about quorum-sensing gives rise to the potential development of drugs and therapies. Quorum-sensing peptides can be manipulated to cause target suicide as well as. Furthermore, quenching quorum-sensing can lead to prevention of antibiotic resistance. Evolution Three key traits have evolved in S. mutans and increased its virulence by enhancing its adaptability to the oral cavity: increased organic acid production, the capacity to form biofilms on the hard surfaces of teeth, and the ability to survive and thrive in a low pH environment. During its evolution, S. mutans acquired the ability to increase the amount of carbohydrates it could metabolize, and consequently more organic acid was produced as a byproduct. This is significant in the formation of dental caries because increased acidity in the oral cavity amplifies the rate of demineralization of the tooth, which leads to carious lesions. It is thought that the trait evolved in S. mutans via lateral gene transfer with another bacterial species present in the oral cavity. There are several genes, SMU.438 and SMU.1561, involved in carbohydrate metabolism that are up-regulated in S. mutans. These genes possibly originated from Lactococcus lactis and S. gallolyticus, respectively. Another instance of lateral gene transfer is responsible for S. mutans‚Äô acquisition of the glucosyltransferase (GTF) gene. The GTF genes found in S. mutans most likely are derived from other anaerobic bacteria found in the oral cavity, such as Lactobacillus or Leuconostoc. Additionally, the GTF genes in S. mutans display homology with similar genes found in Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc. The common ancestral gene is believed to have been used for hydrolysis and linkage of carbohydrates. The third trait that evolved in S. mutans is its ability to not only survive, but also thrive in acidic conditions. This trait gives S. mutans a selective advantage over other members of the oral microbiota. As a result, S. mutans could outcompete other species, and occupy additional regions of the mouth, such as advanced dental plaques, which can be as acidic as pH 4.0. Natural selection is most likely the primary evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this trait. In discussing the evolution of S. mutans, it is imperative to include the role humans have played and the co-evolution that has occurred between the two species. As humans evolved anthropologically, the bacteria evolved biologically. It is widely accepted that the advent of agriculture in early human populations provided the conditions S. mutans needed to evolve into the virulent bacterium it is today. Agriculture introduced fermented foods, as well as more carbohydrate-rich foods, into the diets of historic human populations. These new foods introduced new bacteria to the oral cavity and created new environmental conditions. For example, Lactobacillus or Leuconostoc are typically found in foods such as yogurt and wine. Also, consuming more carbohydrates increased the amount of sugars available to S. mutans for metabolism and lowered the pH of the oral cavity. This new acidic habitat would select for those bacteria that could survive and reproduce at a lower pH. Another significant change to the oral environment occurred during the Industrial Revolution. More efficient refinement and manufacturing of foodstuffs increased the availability and amount of sucrose consumed by humans. This provided S. mutans with more energy resources, and thus exacerbated an already rising rate of dental caries. Refined sugar is pure sucrose, the only sugar that can be converted to sticky glucans, allowing bacteria to form a thick, strongly adhering plaque.

Life He was born in Paris. His father was a businessman of Austrian and Italian descent, his mother was from Berlin. From German-occupied France, he and his mother were brought to safety in Switzerland by his father, a member of the Resistance who died in 1945. After World War II, he moved to Italy, where he took on the surname Corti, and finally began to study German and Romance philology at the University of Innsbruck. Corti worked at public Radio Innsbruck from 1953 onwards, from 1956 to 1960 as head of the literature and radio drama department of the Tyrolean ORF regional radio. He then turned to a career as an assistant director at the Vienna Burgtheater and worked as a director at Theater Oberhausen and Theater Ulm as well as with Peter Brook in London. Called up to return to public broadcasting upon a major restructuring of the ORF radio programmes, he made Austrian radio history with the conception of his weekly Der Schalld√§mpfer broadcasts, which he presented as radio host for more than 24 years from 1969 until 1993. Initially aired by the ORF √ñ3 entertainment radio station, Corti's commentaries in a feuilleton style and his sounding voice stood out of a mainly light music programme. The last Schalld√§mpfer was broadcast three days before his death, featuring the life and work of Rabbi Hillel the Elder. In 1969 Corti worked as an actor in an ORF television play directed by Wolfgang Gl√ºck.

In one sense, it refers to the territorial scope of the Croatian people, emphasising the ethnicity of those Croats living outside Croatia. In the political sense, though, the term refers to an irredentist belief in the equivalence between the territorial scope of the Croatian people and that of the Croatian state. Background The concept of a Greater Croatian state has its modern origins with the Illyrian movement, a pan-South- Slavist cultural and political campaign with roots in the early modern period, and revived by a group of young Croatian intellectuals during the first half of the 19th century. Although this movement arose in the developing European nationalist context of the time, it particularly arose as a response to the more powerful nationalist stirrings in the then-Kingdom of Hungary, with whom Croatia was in a personal union. Map of a Greater Croatia in a 1939 article of the Ustase Hrvatski Domobran newspaper associated with the Ustase organization of the same name, Hrvatski Domobran, that sought recruitment of Croat emigres in Argentina and other countries. This article rejects the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement and the borders that it provided to Croatia as insufficient. The foundations of the concept of Greater Croatia are laid in late 17th and early 18th century works of Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá. He was the first ideologist of Croatian nation who proclaimed that all South Slavs are Croats. His works were used to legitimize expansionism of the Habsburg Empire to the east and south by asserting its historical rights to claim Illyria. \\"Illyria\\" as Slavic territory projected by Vitezoviƒá would eventually incorporate not only most of the Southeastern Europe but also parts of Central Europe such as Hungary. Vitezoviƒá defines territory of Croatia which, besides Illyria and all Slavic populated territory, includes all the territory between Adriatic, Black and Baltic seas. Because the Kingdom of Hungary was so large, Hungary attempted processes of Magyarisation on its constituent territories. As a reaction, Ljudevit Gaj led the creation of the Illyrian movement. This movement aimed to establish Croatian national presence within Austria-Hungary through linguistic and ethnic unity among South Slavs. This was the first and most prominent Pan- Slavic movement in Croatian history. An early proponent of Croatian-based Pan- Slavism was the politician, Count Janko Dra≈°koviƒá. In 1832, he published his Dissertation to the joint Hungarian-Croatian Diet, in which he envisioned a ‚ÄúGreat Illyria‚Äù consisting of all the South Slav provinces of the Habsburg Empire. Likewise, the influential Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer, although a supporter of the Habsburg Monarchy, nonetheless advocated merging the Kingdom of Dalmatia with Croatia. The concept of a Greater Croatia was developed further by Ante Starƒçeviƒá and Eugen Kvaternik, who founded the nationalist Party of Rights (HSP) in 1861. Unlike Strossmayer and the proponents of the Illyrian movement, HSP advocated a united Croatia that stood independently of a Pan-Slavic umbrella state. Starƒçeviƒá was an early opponent of Croatia's unification with Serbs and Slovenes (chiefly the Kingdom of Serbia); their ideologies gradually gained popularity during the interwar period as tensions grew in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between the Croatian and the more influential Serbian political leaders. Ensuing events surrounding the ideology culminated in the World War II conflict between the Independent State of Croatia and its opponents including Chetnik Serbs and Communists of all ethnicities (including Croatian). Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement Map of the Banovina of Croatia. Amid rising ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs in the 1930s, an autonomous state within Yugoslavia, called the Banovina of Croatia was peacefully negotiated in the Yugoslav parliament in the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement of 1939. Croatia was united into a single territorial unit and was provided territories of parts of present-day Vojvodina, and both Posavina and southern parts of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had Croatian majority at the time. Independent State of Croatia Districts of the Independent State of Croatia in 1943 The first modern development of a Greater Croatia came about with the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH). Following occupation of the country by Axis forces in 1941, Slavko Kvaternik, deputy leader of the Usta≈°e proclaimed the establishment of the NDH. The Usta≈°a, an ultranationalist and fascist movement founded in 1929 supported a Greater Croatia that would extend to the River Drina and to the edge of Belgrade. Ante Paveliƒá, the Usta≈°e's Poglavnik (leader) had been in negotiations with Fascist Italy since 1927. These negotiations included Paveliƒá supporting Italy's annexation of its claimed territory in Dalmatia in exchange for Italy supporting an independent Croatia. In addition, Mussolini offered Paveliƒá the right for Croatia to annex all of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Paveliƒá agreed to this exchange. The Greater Croatia ideology, combined with Nazi racial theory, culminated in the Genocide of Serbs and the Holocaust in NDH carried out by Usta≈°a. Bosnian War The most recent expression of a Greater Croatia arose in the aftermath of the breakup of Yugoslavia. When the multiethnic Yugoslav republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence in 1992, Bosnian Serb political representatives, who had boycotted the referendum, established their own government of Republika Srpska, whereupon their forces attacked the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the beginning of the Bosnian war, the Croats and Bosniaks formed an alliance against the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The main Croat army was the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), and the Bosniak was the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). In November 1991, the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia was established as an autonomous Croat territorial unit within Bosnia and Herzegovina. The leaders of Herzeg-Bosnia called it a temporary measure during the conflict with the Serb forces and claimed it had no secessionary goal. The Croatian Defence Forces (HOS), a paramilitary wing of the Croatian Party of Rights, supported a confederation between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but on the basis of the NDH. Over time, the relations between Croats and Bosniaks worsened, resulting in the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War, which lasted until early 1994 and the signing of the Washington Agreement. Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman was criticised for trying to expand the borders of Croatia, mostly by annexing Herzegovina and parts of Bosnia with Croat majorities. In 2013, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) ruled, by a majority, that the Croatian leadership had a goal to join the areas of Herzeg-Bosnia to a \\"Greater Croatia\\", in accordance with the borders of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939. Judge Jean-Claude Antonetti, the presiding judge in the trial, issued a separate opinion in which he disputed the notion that Tuƒëman had a plan to divide Bosnia. On 29 November 2017, the Appeals Chamber concluded that Tuƒëman shared the ultimate purpose of \\"setting up a Croatian entity that reconstituted earlier borders and that facilitated the reunification of the Croatian people\\".

Description A general store in Columbia The site was proclaimed a state historic park in 1945, and the restored buildings are operated as an inhabited, working open-air museum. Individuals in period costumes run a handmade candy store, a Daguerreotype studio, and stagecoach rides, among other stores and restaurants. The Columbia Museum, formerly the Cavalier Museum, is located in the Knapp building. Volunteers with the Friends of Columbia State Historic Park host many special living history programs at the park each year. During Gold Rush Days, held the second Saturday of each month, park docents in period clothing lead programs in the park, and there are special exhibits and hands-on activities. Free tours of the town are offered on weekends year-round and daily in the summer. History Gold was discovered in the area that became Columbia on March 27, 1850, and was one of the richest finds of the California Gold Rush. The surface-level deposits were amenable to placer mining, but lacked water needed for such operations. Over the next seven years, a network of water supply aqueducts was built (at a cost of over $1 million) to the area to support mining operations. By 1852, sufficient water was arriving to support the development of a mining boom town, and large-scale mining operations began in 1856. The town was incorporated in 1854, and its population fluctuated in the 1850s between 2,000 and 5,000 people. The town was repeatedly struck by fire, and much of the construction after an 1857 fire was in brick. Media exposure Columbia State Historic Park has been used as a shooting location for many films and television scenes.

History The custom of bearing on the person objects of this character was evidently derived from the pagan practice of wearing bullae, containing amulets, round the neck as a protection against incantations; the Church endeavoured to purify this usage from superstition by substituting objects venerated by Christians for those to which they had been accustomed before conversion. According to St. Jerome, however (in Matt., c. xxiii), some of the faithful in his day attached a superstitious importance to these aids to piety; he censures certain classes of women who seem to have, in some degree, identified sanctity with an exaggerated veneration for sacred relics: \\"Hoc quod apud nos superstitiosae mulierculae in parvulis evangeliis et in crucis ligno et istiusmodi rebus, quae habent quidem zelum Dei, sed non secundum scientiam, factitant\\" (That which superstitious women amongst us, who have a certain zeal for God but not of right knowledge, do in regard to little copies of the Gospels, the wood of the cross, and things of that kind). Engolpia were of various forms, oval, round, four-cornered and of various materials ranging from gold to glass. In 1571 two gold encolpia, square in form, were found in tombs of the ancient Vatican cemetery, engraved on one side with the monogram of Christ between the Alpha and Omega, and on the other with a dove. Another, now lost, was found in the tomb of Maria, wife of the Emperor Honorius, bearing the names of the imperial couple with the legend VIVATIS and the monogram. The famous treasure of Monza contains the theca persica, enclosing a text from the Gospel of St. John, sent by Pope St. Gregory the Great (590-604) to Queen Theodolinda for her son Adaloald. Another of the gifts of this pope to the Lombard queen was a cruciform encolpion containing a portion of the True Cross. Probably the most interesting reliquary of this form is a gold pectoral cross discovered at Rome in 1863, in the basilica of S. Lorenzo (fuori le mura), on the breast of a corpse. On one side it bears the inscription: EMMANOTHA NOBISCUM DEUS (Emmanuel, God with us), and on the other: CRUX EST VITA MIHI, MORS INIMICE TIBE (To me the Cross is life; to thee, O enemy, it is death). To the category of engolpia belong also the ampullae, or vials or vessels of lead, clay or other materials in which were preserved such esteemed relics as oil from the lamps that burned before the Holy Sepulchre, and the golden keys with filings from St. Peter's chains, one of which was sent by St. Gregory the Great to the Frankish King Childebert. Encolpion, a different anglicization of the same word, covers the early medieval tradition in both Eastern and Western Christianity. Modern use Znamenny Icon of the Theotokos. All bishops wear a particular kind of engolpion called a Panagia (Greek: Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒ±), which depicts the Theotokos (Virgin Mary). All primates and some bishops below primatial rank have the dignity of wearing a second engolpion, which usually depicts Christ. Occasionally, an archimandrite may be awarded an engolpion which bears not an icon of Christ or the Theotokos, but of the Cross. The enkolpion may be worn at all times as part of the bishop's street dress or choir dress. When the bishop vests for Divine Services, he will wear also a pectoral cross. When a bishop is vested before the Divine Liturgy, if he has the dignity of wearing an enkolpion in addition to the Panagia, the Protodeacon chants the following prayer as the subdeacons place it on the bishop: \\"Thy heart is inditing of a good matter; thou shalt speak of the deeds unto the King, always, now and ever, and unto the ages of age. Amen\\". Some enkolpia are hollow, so they may be used as a reliquary. The enkolpia may have originated from the eucharistic lockets once worn by monks in order to be able to communicate themselves when they travelled. Since bishops are monks and often travelled they would have naturally have had such lockets and since they were bishops their eucharistic lockets would have been made and ornamented with much more precious materials than those of ordinary monks.

Headquartered in Imperial Beach, California, in 2007 Wildcoast established a Mexican division, Costasalvaje A.C. in Tijuana to manage its conservation programs in Latin America. Charity Navigator awarded Wildcoast its four-star charity ranking. The organization received the Excellence in Organizational Development Award from Nonprofit Management Solutions in 2006. It also received the San Diego Earthworks E.A.R.T.H. Award in 2007. In 2008, Wildcoast received the Green Wave Award from the Surfer's Path Magazine.

These are some of the most ecologically important coastal areas remaining on the planet and are teeming with wildlife including endangered species of sea turtles, whales and migratory birds. Inhabited by people who make their living from fishing, ranching, and ecotourism, these locations are threatened by megaresort construction, land speculation, energy development, and mining projects. Working in partnership with local community-based organizations and landowners, Wildcoast provides support for land conservation projects such as easements, private reserves, concessions, and sustainable development projects. Many of Wildcoast conservation projects are carried out with members of ejidos, or communal agrarian cooperatives and private landowners to help them hold on to their ancestral land and receive financial incentives to protect the land from development. Wildcoast made history by working with the Laguna San Ignacio Conservation Alliance in the brokering of a deal to protect the entire territory of the Ejido Luis Echeverria in San Ignacio Lagoon. The legally binding deal is being praised as a model for conserving both the environment and the local way of life. San Ignacio is the world‚Äôs last undeveloped gray whale lagoon and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along the North Central Coast of Baja California Wildcoast has protected more than of coastline through conservation easements. In addition, Wildcoast worked to halt a series of megaresort and marina projects slated for this region in Baja California that would have obliterated world-class coastal biodiversity sites. =Wildlife conservation= The focus of the Wildlife Conservation Program is to protect endangered marine species and their habitats. In 2006, Wildcoast carried out a wildly successful campaign \\"Defiende el Mar\\" (Defend the Sea) to support the creation of marine protected areas along the central coast of California and Mexico‚Äôs Gulf of California. The campaign took place at the 2006 Soccer World Cup in Germany involving partnerships with Mexican soccer stars, Jorge Campos and \\"Kikin\\" Fonseca, to promote marine protected areas. The campaign resulted in the establishment of a marine reserve in Bah√≠a de los √Ångeles in the Sea of Cortez and a network of marine reserves near the coast of Monterey and Santa Cruz in California. Jorge Campos, one of the world‚Äôs greatest goalies, received the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Environmental Hero award for his work with Wildcoast to defend the ocean. From 2007-2008 the Wildcoast pro-MPA campaign featured Mexican wrestler El Hijo del Santo who has ardently campaigned for new marine reserves in California and marine conservation in Mexico. The Wildcoast \\"Don‚Äôt Eat Sea Turtle\\" campaign, an ongoing effort to reduce the demand for sea turtle eggs and meat throughout Mexico and Latin America received worldwide attention with its celebrity spokespeople, model Dorismar, and musicians Man√° and Los Tigres del Norte. The campaign featured public service announcements, posters, post cards, advertisements on bus stops, and a conference and press event in Acapulco ‚Äì a center for the black market trade in sea turtle eggs. Randy Olson of Shifting Baselines called the campaign the \\"best ocean campaign in human history\\". Wildcoast has launched a new initiative to protect sharks. This campaign resulted in the cessation of a shark massacre in the Mexican state of Guerrero after an American surfer was killed in a shark attack in May 2008. Recently, Wildcoast has also focused on the establishment of Marine Protected Areas in California. A science-based network of Marine Protected Areas is critical to ensure the survival of marine wildlife into the future as well as maintaining Southern California‚Äôs greatest resource. =Coastal conservation= Every year thousands of Californians are exposed to hazardous waste, viruses, and bacteria contained in the millions of gallons of untreated water that flows daily into our ocean. Recreational ocean users and people fishing along the US-Mexico border are those most affected. The Coastal Conservation Program was developed to raise awareness of the public and environmental health risks associated with the pollution, to create a dialogue among stakeholders ‚Äì residents, businesses, government agencies and to promote national media attention on a problem that threatens our communities and is often dismissed as an insurmountable problem. Wildcoast proposes solutions to the pollution associated with increasing levels of urban and industrial development in the Californias. In 2006, Wildcoast launched the \\"Clean Water Now!\\" campaign along the U.S.-Mexico border to reduce the exposure of children to toxic sewage and to reduce beach closures in the region. As part of the campaign, they helped to pressure a contractor into cleaning up collector systems along the U.S.-Mexico border for renegade sewage flows. In the ongoing effort to promote community involvement in clean water solutions along the US- Mexico Border, Wildcoast held three community forums for residents to discuss the issues and solicit involvement. More than 100 people attended the forums and pledge support for the campaign. In addition, Wildcoast sponsored the 2nd Annual Kids for Clean Water Surf Contest and the 4th Annual Dempsey Holder Memorial Expression Session and Ocean Festival. More than 600 people from all walks of life gathered to learn more about ocean pollution and ways to clean it up. In 2008, Senator Dianne Feinstein with the support of the White House appropriated more than $66 million to upgrade the sewage treatment facility along the U.S.-Mexico border. Wildcoast is a member of the Save San Onofre coalition to halt the development of a toll road that would seriously impact the fabled Trestles surf break and San Onofre State Park in Orange County, California. The campaign included a trip to Sacramento to ask that legislators stop the toll road project as well as participation in the massive \\"Big Wednesday\\" protest at the Del Mar Fairgrounds against the Toll Road in February 2008. Media Wildcoast is noted for its ability to work with the media in English and Spanish to bring attention to pressing coastal and marine conservation issues of global concern. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, BBC News, National Public Radio, NBC Nightly News, The Today Show, CBS News, Good Magazine, and Newsweek have reported on the work of Wildcoast. In addition, the organization is a frequent guest on television networks Televisa, TV Azteca, Azteca America, Univision, and Telemundo to promote ocean conservation.

Panagia (Greek: Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒ±, fem. of pan√°gios, pan- + h√°gios, the All-Holy, or the Most Holy; pronounced ) (also transliterated Panaghia or Panajia), in Medieval and Modern Greek, is one of the titles of Mary, mother of Jesus, used especially in Eastern Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity. Most Greek churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary are called Panagia; the standard western Christian designation of \\"St. Mary\\" is rarely used in the Orthodox East, as Mary is considered the holiest of all human beings and therefore of higher status than the Saints. Iconography Panagia is also the term for a particular type of icon of the Theotokos, wherein she is facing the viewer directly, usually depicted full length with her hands in the orans position, and with a medallion showing the image of Christ as a child in front of her chest.Great Panagia, History of Russian Painting, by Boguslawski This medallion symbolically represents Jesus within the womb of the Virgin Mary at the moment of the Incarnation. This type of icon is also called the Platyt√©ra (Greek: Œ†ŒªŒ±œÑœÖœÑŒ≠œÅŒ±, literally wider or more spacious): poetically, by containing the Creator of the Universe in her womb, Mary has become Platytera ton ouranon (Œ†ŒªŒ±œÑœÖœÑŒ≠œÅŒ± œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒüœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩ·ø∂ŒΩ), \\"more spacious than the Heavens\\". This type is also sometimes called the Virgin of the Sign or Our Lady of the Sign, a reference to Isaiah 7:14: > Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall > conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. Such an image is often placed on the inside of the apse which rises directly over the altar of Orthodox churches.St. Paul's Irvine In contrast with standard religious mosaics which usually have gold backgrounds, the Platytera is often depicted on a dark blue background, sometimes dotted with gold stars: a reference to the Heavens. As with most Orthodox icons of Mary, the letters ŒúŒ° ŒòŒ• (short for ŒúŒóŒ§ŒóŒ° ŒòŒïŒüŒ•, \\"Mother of God\\") are usually placed on the upper left and right of the halo of the Virgin Mary. Vestment Byzantine-style bronze panagia from Jerusalem By extension of this last sense, a panagia is an engolpion with an icon of the Theotokos, worn by an Orthodox bishop. They can be very simple Orthodox Church in America or extremely elaborate,Orthodox Church in America depending on the personal taste of the particular bishop. Saint Patriarch Tikhon in monastic habit with panagia and engolpion of Jesus When an Orthodox bishop is vested for the Divine Liturgy or another service, he wears a panagia and a pectoral cross over his other vestments.Press releases, Saint Vladimir Orthodox theological seminary The primate of an autocephalous church, when fully vested, wears a panagia, a pectoral cross, and an engolpion of Jesus.Three Hieararchs Chapel, Saint Vladimir Orthodox theological seminary Bishops of all ranks when not vested will usually wear the panagia alone over their riassaOCA photo (cassock); this is often the detail that, to the casual observer, distinguishes a bishop from a priest or a monk. The panagia is usually oval in shape and crowned with a depiction of an Eastern mitre. Sometimes, bishops will wear a panagia which is either square (see picture, right) or shaped like a Byzantine double-headed eagle; this latter is especially true of Greek bishops. When the bishop is vested before the Divine Liturgy, the panagia is presented to him on a tray. He blesses it with both hands and the subdeacons bring it to him to kiss and place the panagia around his neck, while the protodeacon swings the censer and says the following prayer: > May God create a clean heart in thee, and renew a right spirit within thee, > always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. After the liturgy, when the bishop takes the panagia off to unvest, he crosses himself, kisses the panagia and places it on the Holy Table (altar). After unvesting and putting on his outer riassa, he blesses the panagia, crosses himself again, and puts it on, before exiting through the Holy Doors to bless the faithful. Blessed bread The particles placed on the diskos during the Divine Liturgy. The large cube is the Lamb, the triangle to the left is the particle for the Theotokos taken out of the Panagia. Panagia may also refer to a prosphoron (·ºåœÅœÑŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒ±œÇ, √Årtos tƒìs Panag√≠as, \\"Bread of the All-Holy\\") which is solemnly blessed in honor of the Theotokos during the Divine Liturgy (see Prosphora for details). From this loaf, a large triangle in honour of the Theotokos is cut and placed on the diskos (paten) during the Liturgy of Preparation. The remainder of the loaf is blessed over the Holy Table (altar) during the hymn Axion Estin, just before the blessing of the antidoron. The priest makes the Sign of the Cross with the Panagia over the Sacred Mysteries (consecrated Body and Blood of Christ) as he says, \\"Great is the name of the Holy Trinity.\\" In some monasteries there is a special rite ceremony called the \\"Lifting of the Panagia\\" which takes place in the trapeza (refectory). After the dismissal of the Liturgy, a triangular portion is cut from the prosphoron by the refectorian (monk in charge of the refectory). The Panagia is then cut in half and laid crust downwards on a tray. The brethren will go in procession from the catholicon (main church) to the trapeza, and the Panagia is carried on its tray at the head of the procession. Once there, the Panagia is placed on a table called the Panagiarion. After the meal, the refectorian takes off his klobuk (epanokamelavkion and kamilavkion), and bows to the assembled brethren, saying, \\"Bless me, holy Fathers, and pardon me a sinner,\\" to which the brotherhood bows and replies, \\"May God pardon and have mercy on you.\\" Then, taking the Panagia in his fingertips, he lifts it up while saying, \\"Great is the name,\\" and then the community continues with \\"of the Holy Trinity.\\" The rite then continues with, \\"O All-holy Mother of God, help us!\\" with the reply, \\"At her prayers, O God, have mercy and save us.\\" Two hymns are then sung while the refectorian, accompanied by a cleric with a hand censer, offers the Panagia to those assembled. Each takes a piece between his finger and thumb, passes it through the incense, and then consumes it as a blessing.The oldest known surviving manuscript contain the ritual of the \\"Elevation of the Panagia\\" is found among the manuscripts preserved at Dumbarton Oaks near Washington, DC. Names From \\"Panagia\\" derive the common Greek given names Panagiota (feminine; pronunciation: Pah-nah-YAW-tah, ; common diminutives: Ghiota, Nota) and Panagiotis (masculine; pronunciation: Pah-nah-YAW-tees, ; common diminutives: Panos, Notis). Both names signify that the person is named in honor of Mary, mother of Jesus and consequently their name days are celebrated as if they were named Mary or Marios. In the Orthodox world, specific icons and churches of the Virgin Mary are often given particular names, which reflect certain theological or intercessory aspects of Mary, or certain standardised depictions in hagiography, or peculiarities of the particular church or monastery. Some examples of such names (in Greek) are: *Angeloktiste (Angel-Built) *Bebaia Elpis (the Certain Hope) *Boetheia (the Helper) *Brephokratousa (the Infant-Holder) *Chrysopege (the Fountain of Gold) *Deomene (the Supplicant) *Eleousa (the Merciful) *Eleutherotria (the Liberator) *Evangelistria (the Bearer of Good News) *Galatiane or Galatousa (the Nurse) *Giatrissa (the Healer) *Glykophilousa (of the Sweet Kiss) *Gorgoepekoos (the Quick-To-Listen) *Gregorousa (the Vigilant) *Hagia Skepe (the Sacred Protection) *Hagia Zone (the Sacred Girdle) *Hodegetria (the Leader) *Hypermachos Strategos (the Defending General) *Kataphyge (the Safe Haven) *Megalochare (Of Great Grace) *Myrobletissa (the Spring of Myrrh) *Myrtiotissa (of the Myrtles) *Nerantziotissa (in the Bitter Oranges) *Pantanassa (the Queen of All) *Paraportiane or Portaitissa (by the Gate) *Paregoretria (the Giver of Solace) *Phaneromene (the Revealed) *Pharmakolytria (the Deliverer from poison) *Platytera ton Ouranon (the Wider than the Heavens) *Ponolytria (the Deliverer from pain) *Thalassine (of the Sea) References *The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity, p. 368 () Category:Eastern Christian vestments Category:Eastern Orthodox icons of the Virgin Mary Category:Titles of Mary Category:Virgin Mary in art ","title":"Panagia"},{"id":"1917130","text":"The Electricity Commissioners were a department of the United Kingdom government's Ministry of Transport, which regulated the electricity supply industry from 1920 until nationalisation in 1948. It was responsible for securing reorganisation on a regional basis and considered schemes for centralisation in a small number of large generating stations owned by joint electricity authorities.  History  In 1917, the UK government was planning the reconstruction of the nation's industries after the First World War. The Board of Trade set up the Electric Power Supply Committee, chaired by Sir Archibald Williamson, which proposed the effective nationalisation of the industry. Subsequently, in 1919 under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Birchenough, the Advisory Council to the Ministry of Reconstruction produced the Report of the Committee of ChairmenViscount Haldane, Sir Archibald Williamson and Sir Charles Parsons on Electric Power Supply. The committee were asked to submit general comments or suggestions on the broad administrative and commercial issues which had arisen out of the Williamson Report. The Birchenough Committee generally agreed with the Williamson Report but recommended that generation and transmission should be a single unified system with state regulation and finance and that means should be found for including distribution as well.\\"Electricity Supply in the UK: A chronology\\"The Electricity Council, 1987, This recommendation was very far-sighted but considered too ambitious by the government. If acted upon it would have anticipated the Electricity Act 1947 by 28 years.The Transmission of Electricity in England and Wales; land use and amenities, Goulty, George A, PHD thesis, Durham University 1969 Parliament rejected what would have been the effective nationalisation of the industry but enacted two of the committee's recommendations in a weaker form, including the setting up Electricity Commissioners and a number of joint electricity authorities formed by the electricity suppliers in each area. The Electricity (Supply) Act 1919, was based essentially on the Williamson and Birchenough reports and introduced central co-ordination by establishing the Electricity Commissioners, an official body responsible for securing reorganisation on a regional basis.\\"Electricity Supply in the UK: A chronology\\"The Electricity Council, 1987, = Operations = In 1925 the Commissioners approved a system for the standardisation of electricity supply. The generation and distribution of electricity was undertaken at a range of voltages and frequencies; 109 suppliers provided AC only, 297 DC only, and 176 both AC and DC. Supply voltages ranged from 100 V to >3000 V. The frequency of AC supplies were at 15 different frequencies ranging from 25 Hz to 100 Hz, even at the most common frequency of 50 Hz (supplied by 223 undertakings) some provided single phase, some 2-phase and some 3-phase. The standard proposed by the Commissioners was three-phase AC of 6.6 kV (or 11 kV, 33 kV, 49.5 kV or 66 kV). Lower voltages could be DC or AC. Frequency was to be 50 Hz ¬± 2.5%. The Electricity Commissioners published standards and guidance for electricity installations and reports on conferences and strategic policies for the industry (see Publications section). The Electricity Commissioners recognised that their activities had met with limited success, they were involved in many public inquiries and negotiations between electricity undertakings.Hannah (1979) pp. 85-6 Their powers of compulsion had been removed from the 1919 Electricity Bill and the period 1920 to 1926 has been characterised as a diagnosis of failure.Hannah (1979) pp. 75-100 Some of these issues were addressed by the Weir Committee in 1925 which led to the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926 and the establishment of the Central Electricity Board. The CEB operated alongside the Electricity Commissioners until both were abolished upon nationalisation of the electricity industry on 1 April 1948. Section 58 of the Electricity Act 1947 gave the Minister the power to dissolve the Electricity Commissioners.Electricity Act 1947 Section 58 The Electricity Commissioners existed for some years after nationalisation, and finally closed in 1953.

The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1793, when Royal Navy captain Sir Home Popham organised groups of fishermen to guard against French vessels off the coast of Nieuwpoort, Belgium. At Popham's suggestion the British Admiralty subsequently authorised the formation of co-ordinated Sea Fencible units along the English and Irish coasts. From 1804 on they were supported by a network of Martello towers. Popham's Sea Fencible companies consisted of merchant seamen using their own private or commercial vessels, but operating under letters of marque that authorised them to capture enemy ships should opportunity arise. The Navy provided the Fencibles with uniforms and weapons; it also protected them from the depredations of navy press gangs. The British Admiralty disbanded its Sea Fencible units in 1810. Great Britain =Inception= Sir Home Popham, originator of the \\"Sea Fencibles\\" concept in 1793. Royal Navy captain Sir Home Popham developed the Sea Fencibles concept while serving as Britain's Agent for Transport in Flanders during the French Revolutionary Wars. In July 1793 Popham went to Ostend to oversee the fleet of Navy transports supplying the British Army. In October a French army of 12,000 men laid siege to the British-held town of Nieuwpoort, which was defended by a garrison of 1,300. French capture of Neiuwpoort would have cleared the path for an assault on the British headquarters at Ostend.Popham 1991, p.45 In support of the Nieuwpoort garrison, Popham armed and equipped the town's fishing fleet and led it in action against French vessels along the coast.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.380. In correspondence with the Admiralty Popham named his impromptu fleet the \\"Sea Fencibles,\\" drawing an analogy with the land-based Scottish Highland Fencible Corps.Browne 1854, p. 368 After three days the French abandoned the siege of Nieuwpoort and withdrew towards Toulon. Both the Army's Commander-in-Chief the Duke of York and field commander General Sir Charles Grey subsequently acknowledged that Popham's actions in \\"arming the fishermen of Flanders in defence of their own towns\\" had played a significant role in preserving British control of Nieuwpoort.Correspondence, Duke of York and Albany, Sir Charles Grey, 2 November 1793.

When a French invasion of Britain appeared imminent in 1798, Popham recommended that Admiralty create a similar body to defend the coast between Cornwall and the Firth of Forth.National Maritime Museum - \\"Who were the Sea Fencibles?\\"Popham 1991, p. 55 Britain's Sea Fencibles were duly formed on 14 May 1798 \\"for the protection of the coast, either on shore or afloat; comprising all fishermen and other persons occupied in the ports, and on the coast, who, from their occupations are to be unpressed.\\" Their tasks were to defend the Martello towers along the British coastline, patrol and survey the beaches where a French invasion force might land, and to maintain a fleet of armed commercial vessels in order to capture enemy shipping and defend against invasion barges. =Structure= The Sea Fencibles were divided into 36 companies, with each company responsible for patrolling and defending a section of the coastline. Company command was vested in three Royal Navy captains and up to six Lieutenants per district. The district captains reported in turn to the Director of Sea Fencibles, an admiral. A senior Sea Fencibles captain received ¬£1 15s a day (equivalent to ¬£ today), junior captains received ¬£1 10s (equivalent to ¬£ today), and Lieutenants 8s 6d (equivalent to ¬£ today). Petty Officers received 2s 6d (equivalent to ¬£ today) for each day they assembled, while Ordinary Seamen received 1 shilling and provisions (food and drink), or 2 shillings if no provisions were available (equivalent to ¬£ and ¬£ today). Sea Fencibles were also eligible to receive prize and salvage money. For example, on 13 June 1805 the sixth-rate frigate and the Sea Fencibles recaptured the Industry, off Hastings, and shared the subsequent salvage money. Sea Fencible volunteers were trained in the use of arms and were required to man watch and signal towers, and fixed and floating batteries along the coasts and ports. Those who operated commercial vessels, for example local fishermen, received up to four cannons per craft and training in their maintenance and use. The Admiralty commissioned a small number of armed vessels for use in districts where there were insufficient private craft to meet a Sea Fencible company's needs. A member of the Sea Fencibles would spend one day a week training. They were also allowed to choose their own Petty Officers at the rate of one per 25 men. All Sea Fencibles received a certificate that exempted them from impressment into the Navy. The Treasury argued that the exemption from impressment was the principal reason smugglers joined as impressment was a common punishment for smuggling.Daly (2007), p.44. The Sea Fencibles operated in accordance with letters of marque authorising the capture of French or Spanish merchant shipping and a share of the proceeds should the seized vessel then be sold. Their fleet consisted of small vessels such as colliers and coasting vessels such as hoys adapted to serve as gunboats. The owners were expected to pay for the fitting of slides, ring and eye bolts for the installation of guns, usually two forward and two aft, and in smaller craft to fit sweeps for use in calms. The Admiralty provided guns, ammunition and powder, and it required the ship owners to keep close and regular accounts of their use. The owners were under orders to co-operate with the Royal Navy, and they were entitled to payment of compensation, according to the size of their ships and the amount of time they were required. For instance, on 28 September 1804 the Navy held a meeting with the owners of 16 hoys at Margate. The Navy then hired the vessels for the defence of the coast. The Navy manned each vessel with a regular Navy man as master and nine men from the Sea Fencibles.The Naval Chronicle, Volume 12, p.329. =Recruitment= Captain Nathaniel Portlock RN, Commander of the Dartmouth Sea Fencibles 1805-1807. Sea Fencibles recruitment was brisk with 23,500 volunteers in the first four years. Officer recruitment also proceeded swiftly, particularly among younger captains who lacked the seniority for an ocean-going command. By 1803, one third of Sea Fencibles captains were men promoted to that rank within the preceding twelve months. Sea Fencibles command also offered the prospect of relatively easy service on full pay. For this reason it was appealed to a group of older captains whose Navy careers were near their natural end. The oldest captain, Sir Edmund Nagle, had served at sea for more than three decades before taking command of the Sea Fencibles at Shoreham-by-Sea in 1803. Home Popham himself was appointed to head up the district between Beachy Head and Deal, the area considered at greatest risk of French invasion.Popham 1991, pp.55-6. Another Sea Fencible was Francis Austen, a naval captain and future admiral who was the brother of the novelist Jane Austen. He was appointed to raise and organise a corps of Sea Fencibles to defend a strip of the Kentish coast. =Active duty= On 13 November 1798 a French privateer appeared off Hastings. Captain E.H. Columbine of the Sea Fencibles put a number of his men on the cutter Lion, offered by a Mr. Wexham, and set out after the French vessel. They caught up with their quarry after a chase and captured her after \\"a little firing\\" that resulted in the death of one Frenchman. The privateer was the Success, of Cherbourg, Nicholas Dubois, master, with four guns and 24 men. She had been out four days without making any captures. Captain Columbine remarked on the \\"zeal and readiness\\" of the Hastings men. A second case occurred on 9 January 1799. The next day Captain Edward Buller, commander of the Sea Fencibles along the coast of Devon, reported that on the previous day, the brig Susannah had left Dartmouth only to fall prey to the French 14-gun privateer Heureux Speculateur. The Brixham Sea Fencibles. seeing this take place, took a boat, and armed only with muskets and pikes, succeeded in recapturing the Susannah and her prize crew. Lieutenant Nicholas, with the assistance of Revenue Collector Brooking, who provided small arms and a boat, took another detachment of Sea Fencibles and, accompanied by a boat from the cutter , set off, unsuccessfully, to capture the privateer. On 11 March of the same year the Margate Sea Fencibles were somewhat more successful. When a small cutter was observed boarding two brigs eight or nine miles from the North Foreland, 40 or 50 Sea Fencibles pushed off in three boats and recaptured the two brigs, the privateer having made off. Another case occurred on 13 June 1804. HM hired armed cutter Princess Augusta, under the command of Lieutenant John Tracey, encountered a 14-gun French privateer off Huntcliff.Naval Chronicle, (Jul-Dec 1805) Vol. 12, p.51. During the engagement, which lasted nearly four hours, the Princess Augusta took several shot near the water line and sustained extensive damage to her rigging. Still, she suffered only three men wounded, though one desperately. The French vessel sheered off on the approach of two schooners manned with Sea Fencibles from Redcar. The French privateer reportedly was under the command of a notorious pirate with the name \\"Blackman\\".Suffolk notes from the year 1729. Compiled from the files of the \\"Ipswich Journal\\" (1883), p.155. The Sea Fencibles also acted as a coastguard or lifeboat service. When wrecked in 1800, the Sea Fencibles attempted a rescue. Similarly, in January 1809, when was wrecked at Kingsgate, near Margate, the Sea Fencibles helped rescue the survivors. However, the Navy was not entirely enthusiastic about this role. In late 1804, the Sea Fencibles in Kinsale rescued the crew of a vessel wrecked in the District. Their commander, Commander Terence O'Neill, reimbursed them out of his own pocket, and then applied to the Navy for reimbursement. This was allowed, but William Marsden, First Secretary of the Admiralty, wrote: \\"But although the conduct of the persons who exerted themselves on this occasion, in saving the lives and property of their fellow creatures is highly meritorious, it has no relation to the service for which they were enrolled, and the precedent, if followed in all other parts where Sea-Fencibles are established, would occasion a very heavy expense to the public.\\"Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, p.319. In February 1810, when it became clear that the threat of invasion by Bonaparte had passed, the Sea Fencibles were disbanded. =River Fencibles= In 1798 watermen and other groups of river tradesmen on the River Thames voluntarily formed associations of River Fencibles. Officially established in 1803 as \\"Corps of River Fencibles of the City of London\\", by 1804 they had uniformed commissioned officers in command. Members of the Corps escorted the barge carrying the body of Lord Nelson along the Thames in small boats during his state funeral in 1806. In 1807 River Fencibles sailed to Copenhagen to help bring back some of the Danish vessels captured there after the second Battle of Copenhagen. The Greenwich River Fencibles consisted of a commandant, three captains, six lieutenants, 24 masters, 24 mates, and 157 gunners and privates. The Government provide pikes, but nothing else, so the men defrayed their own expenses. The Greenwich River Fencibles sent two officers and 126 men to Copenhagen. The City of London, Loyal Greenwich, and Royal Harbour River Fencibles also contributed men to the Walcheren expedition in 1809. The Greenwich River Fencibles alone sent two officers and 130 men on the Walcheren expedition, two of whom were killed.Richardson (1834), p. 23. In all, about 300 Fencibles volunteered to serve at Copenhagen and about the same number served on the Walcheren Expedition.Great Britain, House of Commons Papers, Vol. 23, p.79. The Corps was disbanded in 1813.Records of the Corps of River Fencibles of the City of London : City of London Library =Irish Sea Fencibles= By Admiralty Order, 20 Sea Fencible units were established and a network of Martello towers constructed to protect the Irish coastline.Kerrigan (1980), pp.188-191. The number of men and boats per district varied widely and the British had concerns about their reliability, especially given Robert Emmet's insurrection in Dublin in 1803. In 1804, the Irish Sea Fencibles had some 28 gun vessels of various sorts - a brig, three galliots, and the rest sloops. Generally these carried two 18-pounder guns and two 18-pounder carronades. The owners usually provided a crew consisting of four men and a boy, with the plan that Sea Fencibles would augment this cadre when the vessels had to put out to sea. Canada There were Sea Fencible units attached to the battalions of St. John, Charlotte and Northumberland counties in New Brunswick during the War of 1812 to protect port facilities in the colony. They were raised among seafaring men in coastal communities and seem to have all disbanded after the war. From 1833 to 1867, there was a unit of Saint John Sea Fencibles that functioned primarily as an artillery unit. Its officers and men wore naval uniforms.

Waldm√ºller was one of the most important Austrian painters of the Biedermeier period. Career In 1807 Waldm√ºller attended the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. He lived in Bratislava and, in 1811, he worked as a teacher of arts for the children of Count Gyulay in Croatia. He returned to the Academy of Vienna and studied portrait painting. In 1814 he married the singer Katharina Weidner, and subsequently went on tour with her, working as a set designer. Prater Landscape, 1830 In 1817 he returned to Vienna and spent much time copying the works of old masters and painting portraits, genre subjects, and still-life. In 1823 he made a portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven. Waldm√ºller later became interested in nature and started painting landscapes, which in their loving attention to detail illustrate Waldmuller's belief that the close study of nature should be the basis of painting. These are his most notable works, in which his sense of colour and knowledge of nature helped him to achieve masterly skill. In 1819 he became professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, but was in disputes with the Viennese establishment, most notably for his comments on the system of the academy, where he wanted to establish a focus of the study on nature. His views were in opposition to the official doctrines of ideal art promulgated by the Vienna Academy, and after he had published his works on art education, he was forced to retire in 1857. By 1863 he had been accepted back into the art circles of Vienna, and was knighted in 1865.Richard Rhoda Fine Art, Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller, (accessed 22-07-2014) Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller was one of the most important Austrian painters of the Biedermeier period. Whether it was the conquest of the landscape and thus the convincing rendering of closeness or distance, the accurate characterisation of the human face, the detailed and refined description of textures, or the depiction of rural everyday life: his works ‚Äì brilliant, explanatory, moralising, and socially critical ‚Äì influenced a whole generation of artists. Being an advocate of natural observation and plein air painting, as well as a critic of academic painting, Waldm√ºller was far ahead of his time. Waldmuller died on 23 August 1865 in Hinterbr√ºhl, Austria.

It is the headquarters of the Paschim Medinipur district. It is situated on the banks of the Kangsabati River (variously known as Kasai and Cossye). Etymology There are conflicting accounts of how the name Medinipur came to be. One account claims that Medinipur was named after a local deity \\"Medinimata\\" (literally \\"mother of the world\\", a Shakti incarnation). History A number of prehistoric sites of great interest are being excavated throughout the West Midnapore district. In ancient times the region seems to be highly influenced by Jainism and Buddhism. Coins issued by Samudragupta have been found in the near vicinity of the town. The kingdom of Shashanka and Harshavardhana also included part of undivided Midnapore in their kingdom. However, the most significant archaeological site in the region is the bustling port of Tamralipta near present-day Tamluk, a site noted in the travelogues of Faxian and Xuanzang. Later Chaitanya passed through the area on his way from Puri to Varanasi as documented in the Chaitanya Charitamrita. After the fall of last independent Hindu dynasty of Kalinga-Utkala, Gajapati Mukunda Deva in the 16th century, this region came under one of the five Sarkars of Mughalbandi Odisha i.e. Jaleswar Sarkar which was ruled by the Subehdar of Odisha. The north boundary of Jalshwar was Tamluk and south was Soro and Dhalbhumgarh in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east. Bahadur Khan was the ruler of Jaleshwar Sarkar or Hijli (including Midnapore) during the time of Shah Jehan. He was defeated by Shah Shuja, the second son of Shah Jehan, then the subshdar of Bengal. During the era of the Muslim rulers of Bengal nawab, Alivardi Khan's general Mir Jafar fought successfully against Mir Habib's lieutenant Sayyid Nur near Midnapore town in 1746. This was part of his campaign to regain Odisha and thwart the Maratha attacks on Bengal. Mir Habib came up from Balasore and was joined by the Marathas, but Mir Jafar fled to Burdwan, leaving Mir Habib to retake Midnapore with ease. Alivardi defeated Janoji Bhosle, a Maratha chieftain, in a severely contested battle near Burdwan in 1747 and Janoji fled to Midnapore. The Marathas held on to Odisha including Midnapore until 1749 when it was reconquered by Alivardi. The Marathas continued to raid Midnapore, which proved disastrous for the residents. In 1756, Alivardi died and his successor was Siraj-ud-daulah. On 20 June 1757, he was betrayed by Mir Jafar to the East India Company under the command of Lord Robert Clive at Plassey. This consolidated the Company's hold on Bengal and Odisha (along with Midnapore). The district of Midnapore which included Dhalbhum or Ghatshila, now in Singhbhum, Jharkhand was annexed in 1760 along with Burdwan and Chittagong both handed over to the East India Company by Mir Qasim. The last free king of Dhalbhum was imprisoned in Midnapore town. Some of the Malla kings of Mallabhum in the Bankura district held land in northern Midnapore district, while the Raj rules of Narajole, Jhargram, Lalgarh, Jamboni, and Chandrakona held sway in their local areas. The Raj rulers in Rajasthan would pay homage to Jagannath but carves out their own territories under the supremacy of the Hindu empires of Odisha. Midnapore is notable for its contribution in the history of Indian freedom movement since it has produced many martyrs. During the British Raj, the city became a centre of revolutionary activities, such as the Santal Revolt (1766‚Äì1767) and the Chuar rebellion (1799). The Zilla School, now known as Midnapore Collegiate School was the birthplace of many extremist activities. Teachers like Hemchandra Kanungo inspired and guided the pupils to participate in the Indian Freedom Movement. Three British District Magistrates were assassinated in succession by the revolutionaries Bimal Dasgupta, Jyothi Jibon Ghosh, Pradyot Kumar Bhattacharya, Prabhakangsu Pal, Mrigan Dutta, Anath Bandhu Panja, Ramkrishna Roy, Braja Kishor Chakraborty, Nirmal Jibon Ghosh. Khudiram Bose and Satyendranath Basu were some of the young men that laid down their lives for the freedom of India. Kazi Nazrul Islam attended political meetings in Midnapore in the 1920s. Raja Narendra Lal Khan, ruler of Narajole, who donated his palace for Midnapore's first college for women, had been implicated, (although it turned out to be false) for planting a bomb. Khudiram Bose was born in the Habibpur in 1889 and studied at Midnapore Collegiate School up to the eight standard. He was first caught by a policeman for distributing seditious leaflets in Midnapore in 1906. He was an anarchist and protested against the moderate policies of Surendranath Banerjea. Khudiram was sentenced to death for a failed attempt to kill Magistrate Kingsford. Satyendranath was executed on 21 November 1908. Noted freedom fighter and Bengal Province Congress Committee President Birendranath Sasmal practised at the Midnapore High Court. It is the place Roy's popularly known as \\"Babu's of Jara \\" in Jara Ramjibonpur.This Roy Bahadur actual title \\"Gangyopadhyay or Ganguly\\" was an effective, powerful royal family during British Raj. Among them Sanatan Roy and many such like him freedom fighters got birth.This is also the maternal house of Sir Asutosh Mukherjee who is known as Bengal Tiger and Raja Rammohan Roy called \\"The Father of Modern India\\".The Bengali Film \\"Antony Firingii\\" by Uttam Kumar was shot in this palace and the story was also taken from this family. It is also famous for its Durga Puja. Rishi Rajnarayan Basu, one-time tutor of Rabindranath Tagore, Asia's first Nobel Prize winner, was headmaster of the Zila School in 1850. He founded a girls' school, a night school for workers, and a public library. The Rajnarayan Basu Pathagar library is still in existence near Golkuar Chowk. Not only Hindu activists, but also Muslim statesmen originated or spent time in Midnapore. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy Second Chief Minister of Bengal during British Period, Prominent member of Awami league, a prominent political party in Bangladesh, and the fifth Prime Minister of Pakistan, hailed from a prominent family of Midnapore. The Mallick Zamindars also ruled over an extensively large area during the British rule. They also built the Jagannath Temple of Midnapore. The Zamindari house declined after independence but the palace can still be seen at Mallick Chowk at Barabazaar. The palace also has a Durga manch in it and a Krishna temple in it. Geography =Location= Midnapore is located at and is 23 metres above sea-level. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. =Climate= Common hawk cuckoo at Midnapur. Map of Paschim Medinipur district showing Midnapore The climate follows a hot tropical monsoon weather pattern. Summers last from April to mid-June with diurnal highs ranging from the upper 30s¬∞C to the mid 40s¬∞C and lows in the low 30s¬∞C. Daily heat is often followed by evening rains known as kalboishakhis or dust-storms (loo). Monsoon rains can last from mid-June to late August or even September with rains from the southeast monsoon contributing the lion's share of the annual rainfall of around 1500 mm. Winters last for 2 to 3 months and are mild; typical lows are from 8 ¬∞C ‚Äì 14 ¬∞C. Allergies are common in winter and spring due to the high content of particulate dust in the air. Soils near the Kangsabati River are alluvial with a high-degree of clay or sand, whereas soils towards Rangamati are lateritic. Vegetation includes eucalyptus and sal forests on the northwest side of town. The sal forests form part of the Dalma Hills, Bengal-Jharkhand Range. Arabari, the forest range which was the site of India's first Joint Forest Management scheme, is only 30 km away. Elephant attacks on humans are common in this area, although the town itself has never been attacked. Hordes of marauding elephants attacking human habitation in villages in Midnapore district have come as close to the town as Gurguripal, 6 km away. Transportation =Train= Midnapore Railway Station Midnapore railway station is connected not only to larger cities in the region, but also to smaller towns and villages in the district. This railway station is situated on the Kharagpur‚ÄìBankura‚ÄìAdra line. Many local and passenger trains ply all day between Howrah and Midnapore as well as Adra and Midnapore. Apart from these local trains, many major express trains also pass through Midnapore including the Jhargram-Medinipur Jangalmahal Express, Delhi-Puri Nandan Kanan Express, Howrah-Lokmanya Tilak T Samarsatta Express, Puri-Patna Express, Ernakulam- Patna Express etc. Midnapore is close to Kharagpur, a major hub of the South Eastern Railway is 13 kilometres. At present the Midnapore Railway Section is undergoing a development process. The station complex is undergoing modernisation. The platforms are being increased in length. Work is in process to double the railway line between Kharagpur Junction and Midnapore railway station. Apart from an existing railway bridge on the Kangsabati river, a new double line railway bridge has been constructed (carrying traffic from 4 March 2012) to smoothen the railway traffic. =Local transportation= Selected thoroughfares of Midnapore have been expanded and maintained in an ongoing \\"Megacity\\" project started in 1997. The major roads are now upgraded, well lighted and one way with divider. A long-awaited beautiful flyover connecting rangamati over the railway gate minimised the traffic congestion at rush hours. Some of the smaller roads in the city are still unpaved and are difficult to use during and after the monsoon months. To compound the problems faced by inhabitants there are a limited number of bridges crossing the Kasai River affording entry from Howrah and Kolkata (NH6). Nevertheless, the ongoing construction of the new interstate highway system which passes by Midnapore has reduced the time it takes for inhabitants to reach Kolkata. A set of traffic control signals was recently installed in the city, and this helps control traffic. Motorized and bicycle traffic has been increasing in recent years. Within the city, previously cycle rickshaws were one of the few modes of public transportation since effective lobbying by rickshaw-pullers who depend on this for their livelihood had prevented the introduction of town buses and auto rickshaws. Now auto-rickshaws covering the different routes of the city like Railway station, Vidyasagar University, Amtala, Central bus stand, Battala, golkunwar chawk, sipoy bazar by sharing basis, which is a big boost for the city's development. Infrastructure and economy Electricity is available, although as in the rest of West Bengal, demand exceeds supply. Power outages are common in the summer and monsoon months, although outages lasting more than an hour are becoming rarer. Most businesses and upper middle-class and rich households have backup generators and batteries that they use in times of outages. Water is a scarce resource in Midnapore. Most of the water comes from the Kasai river, which is shrinking in size every year due to over-exploitation. The municipal water supply is free but not ample; tap water is available for about an hour twice a day and is stored by those who can, in plastic, metal, or concrete reservoirs or in buckets. The water is of questionable purity prompting the proliferation of individual water purification units. Sewage disposal is another concern. Many of the lower income-communities in the city do not have adequate plumbing and must rely on refuse-collectors to haul out human waste. Not all drains are covered, causing a proliferation of disease causing flies and mosquitoes. Since Midnapore is drier than many other coastal and humid low-lying towns of West Bengal, this problem is not as acute as it. Demographics St. John's Church In the 2011 census, Midnapore municipality had a population of 169,264, out of which 84,977 were males and 84,287 were females. The 0‚Äì6 years population was 15,172. Effective literacy rate for the 7+ population was 88.99 per cent. India census, Medinipur had a population of 153,349. Medinipur has an average literacy rate of 75%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 80%, and female literacy is 71%. In Medinipur, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. .* For language details see Midnapore Sadar (community development block)#Language and religion This makes it the second largest city in Paschim Medinipur district after Kharagpur. The city is almost equally divided in terms of population between Hindus and Muslims. The multiple mosques and temples, many predating British rule serve as indication of how co-prevalent the two religions are in this area. It is an important religious spot for the Muslims of India and Bangladesh. Even though the interesting religious mixture would suggest religious tensions, remarkably Midnapore has never witnessed major Hindu- Muslim tensions in recent history. Police station Midnapore police station has jurisdiction over Midnapore municipality and Midnapore Sadar CD Block. Economy The economy of the undivided district, according to 1991 and 2001 census statistics, was overwhelmingly agrarian. Being a district town, Midnapore functioned in an ancillary role for the rural district as an administrative and judicial centre. As such many businesses and services revolved around this role, which naturally, has been adversely affected by the division of the district. Midnapore still fills this role and has more physicians, lawyers, teachers, banks, and administrative offices than any other town in either East or West Midnapore district. The medical sector is thriving with the addition of a Medical college and the Vidyasagar Institute of Health Application. Coaching centres that assist students enrolled in the regular and correspondence courses of Vidyasagar University are also common. Poorer segments of this semi-rural society are involved in transportation, basic agriculture, small shops and manual labour for construction work. Civic affairs Midnapore is a municipality with 24 wards and 94,738 registered voters (2003 statistics). For a long period of 32 years, it was under the control of the Left Front, in 2009 Trinamool Congress won the municipality by a margin of 2 wards. Now the number of wards increased to 25 and WARDS are renumbered in 2013.civic election is scheduled to take place on 22 November 2013. Culture =Historic attractions= Chapaleswar (Shiva) temple, Karnagarh The Chapaleswar and Mahamaya temples at Karnagarh built in the Odisha style of temple architecture aka Kalinga Architecture, 10 km north of the town, are two of the most popular temples. Both were built in the 10th century by Karna Keshari of Keshari/Soma Vamsi Dynasty of Odisha. This temple is also of historic importance as being a hotspot of the Chuar Revolt during the Indian Independence Movement. Outstanding Hindu and Jain temples are also located in the village of Pathra, a few kilometres from the town. Hundreds of small temples dating back into antiquity are located here but many are in a state of disrepair due in part to lack of any sort of preservation, succumbing to the waters of the Kasai River, and theft of bricks by locals. An NGO Pathra Archaeological Preservation Committee, founded by Yeasin Pathan, has successfully persuaded the Archaeological Survey of India to restore the temples. 2,000,000 Indian rupees were donated for this cause in 1998 and many of the temples have been restored. Remarkably secluded in location, this archaeological site is rarely visited as it is inaccessible and little known outside of the immediate area. The Jagannath Temple at Nutan Bazar was built in 1851, possibly at the request of a descendant of the Ganga dynasty of Odisha. Other temples from the eighteenth century include the Hanuman-jeu Temple in Mirzabazar, the Shitala temple at Barabazar, and the Habibpur Kali Temple. One of the oldest temples in the town is the Rukmini temple at Nutanbazar which was built in the 17th century. The Ramakrishna Mission also has a temple adjacent to an elementary and high school. The goddess Kali at the Battala temple is an important temple in the locality, but is a more recent addition. There are numerous majars and dargahs dotting the city. Jora Masjid is the most notable in the town and is the site of a notable annual urs. Among the majars, Dewan Baba's majar near the District Court and Fakir Kua near the bus terminus are locally revered. According to local legend, the water of the well at Fakir Kua majar has mysterious healing powers, although the veracity of this claim is debatable. In the heyday of Brahmo Samaj, Midnapore became a major centre of this society. Rishi Rajnarayan Basu, one of the luminaries in the Brahmo Samaj movement, worked as the head master of the Zilla School. The dilapidated hall of Brahmo Samaj, \\"Brahmo Samaj Mandir\\" near Midnapore Collegiate School is a silent reminder of the Brahmo presence of yesteryears. Some of the old administrative and educational buildings dating back more than 150 years are still functioning today. In case of music, Basanta Banerjee from Salboni's Banerjee family was the first to introduce achordium first time in the town.Moreover, he had his own orchestra which he used to play in programs . There is other classical honoured singers like Biseswar Sarkar, Pandit Kamalendu Chowdhury who made and still making the town melodious by there fame classical voice.. The royal ruins at Gopegarh Heritage Park A view of the Kasai from Gopegarh Heritage Park =Cultural distinctiveness= Life, in general, is slow-paced in Midnapore, as a sort of tribute to the mofussil provincial heart of the city. Midnaporeans in general are laid-back and friendly. It is not uncommon for shops to open late and to close during the hours of the afternoon in the hotter months of the year. Also shops can close for tea and sporting events such as cricket and World Cup football. Tea-shops and paan-stalls abound and there is a high concentration of mishtir dokaan (sweet-shops). Here you can find one of the very notable sweets in Bengal ‚Äì 'Khirayer Gogjaa'.Adda or Bengali gossip is prevalent and widely enjoyed. The native local Odia dialect is termed as Midnapori Odia. The local dialect of Bengali is different from standard Kolkata pronunciation and though not as Odia-centric as the dialects of Contai and Dantan, but shows similarities with Odia. Speech is very informal and the talebossho, murdhenoshho, and dontesho are often pronounced differently from the standardised West Bengal dialect. A significant fraction of the population of the undivided district descended from Vaishnavites ‚Äì the followers of Shri Chaitanya ‚Äì although they follow the rituals and caste system of mainstream Hinduism now. Odia people of Midnapore are native of the place and merged with migrant Bengalis during British occupation to form a unique culture. In fact, since the area was part of Odisha earlier, it is better described as a mix of Bengali and Odia culture. There are Marwari and Bhojpuri speakers and a number of speakers of Hindi in the town as well. Many of the Muslims of the town speak in a pidgin dialect with a mixture of Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, and Bhojpuri words. =Entertainment= Since many Midnaporeans are fond of walking, a number of parks have come up in recent years.Gopegarh Heritage Park is a good picnic spot for families and youth and was opened in 2001. Booking for picnic spot and boating facilities can be arranged at the ticket counter. The most popular park of the town is Sukumar Sengupta Smriti Uddan (popularly known as Police Line Park) which is near to Central Bus Stand. Other parks are Sishu Uddan and Khudiram Park. Many people can also be seen in the cooler morning and evening hours walking near the riverfront. There are a number of major theatres in the town including the Aurora, Mahua and Hari Cinema Hall. But Aurora, Mahua are closed now, only Hari Cinema Hall is still running A number of private and government operated halls include the Zilla Parishad Hall, Vivekandanda Hall (inside Midnapore College), and Vidyasagar Hall. These are often the venue for numerous cultural events like the hosting of dramas, concerts, poetry-recitals, and dance programs. Some of these are venues for numerous \\"Melas\\" or canivals hosted each year on adjacent grounds such as the Midnapore College-collegiate ground, Church School ground (for the Christmas fair), and the river ground (for large political assemblies). The bank of Kangsabati River (also variously known as Kasai and Cossye) is great for sightseeing and fishing and a popular destination for picnics during the Christmas and New Year's breaks. Unfortunately the bank is being eroded by new construction, brick-kilns and new communities. In the last one year City life, Metro bazzar, reliance trends, Hoffman, like supermarkets have come up and few others to start become the places of time pass and shopping like any other malls in major cities. Rangamati Sarbajanin Durga Puja, 2003 =Food= Mednapore has its unique food culture which people outside the city do not know about. People have their own eating styles which is way different from those living in Kolkata or other parts of the state. There are many amazing dishes and cooking styles which have evolved from this place. Some of the notable ones are \\"Maacher Tel Jhal\\" cooked in West Midnapore and \\"Maacher Tok\\", a spicy and tangy dish prepared by using dried mangoes or raw mangoes with the fish which is cooked in the East Midnapore. Another famous and very unique dish is the \\"Posto Bati\\" which is very different from the \\"Posto Bata\\" or posto paste (opium seeds) which everyone else in Bengal knows about. Also Khirer Goja is a unique sweet of Midnapore Town. =Religious beliefs and festivals= In the month of Asadh, (roughly corresponding to mid-September), Rathayatra is celebrated as is the case in the rest of Odisha. A fair is hosted near the local Jagannath temple. And during Christmas, a fair on the grounds of Nirmal Hriday Ashram is well participated. The church is opened to all on this occasion and people from all communities throng the prayer hall to take a glimpse of the beautiful murals narrating the life of Jesus. The resident students recreate the scene of Jesus' birth with clay models. Apart from that, the regular festivals like Durga Puja, Saraswati Puja, and Kali Puja are well attended. In the last few years, local clubs and communities have competed with each other for designing the best Durga Puja murtis (idols), mandaps (interior of abode), and pandals (bamboo and cloth makeshift enclosures) with hundreds of thousands of rupees often being spent by each club. In recent times, the Pujas hosted by Rangamati Sharbajanin Club, Keranitola, Burdge Town, Chottobazaar, Raja Bazaar, Bidhan Nagar, Ashok Nagar, and Judge's Court have been highly rated. Other common Pujas in the worship of Shitala, Jagaddhatri, Holi, Janmashtami, Manasa, Kartika, and Ganesh are common but not such a major cause of celebration. Vishwakarma Puja is remarkably popular in the city. Unlike in Kolkata, Vishwakarma Puja is not celebrated with flying kites. With respect to its tribal history, people in Midnapur fly Kites to celebrate \\"Mage Porob\\",\\"Baa Porob\\",\\"Baraam Puja\\", the day of a \\"Ho\\" tribal god. This is on the last day of the month of Poush, i.e. Poush Sankranti. Apart from kite-flying, a fair is also held on Poush Sankranti. It has a rural flavour and is characterised by the trading of handicraft and household goods. The items of trade include spades, knives and other iron tools, combs and other goods made of buffalo-horn, baskets (jhuri and dhama) and platters for husking (kula) made of bamboo and cane, etc. Bheema Puja is another Puja that is not widespread elsewhere. And many more religious festivals are held in Midnapore each year. Urs of the venerated saint Syed Shah Murshed Ali Alquadri Al Jilani son of Syed Shah Mehr Ali Alquadri Al Baghdadi is a major occasion for Bengali Muslims of West Bengal and Bangladesh. This is held each year near the Jora masjid (twin mosques). Milad-un-Nabi is also celebrated with the bursting of fireworks. Many devout Muslims observe fasts during the month of Ramadan, which ends in celebration at Eid ul-Fitr. Eid ul-Adha locally known as Bakhri-Eid is also celebrated. During the Remembrance of Muharram, processions throng the streets enacting mock stick-fights in remembrance of Husayn ibn Ali.

The most notable footballer was Ramananda Mukherjee who later had served the Midnapore Referee Club for almost 40 years, including the president. Another footballer was Swapan Chakrabarty, who had been a national level coach. Midnapore's schools and colleges are usually well-ranked in soccer tournaments held at national level.

The project, however, was canceled before any aircraft were built. Design and development The Glenn L. Martin Company submitted design studies in response to the Weapon System 302A requirement in 1952 in competition with proposals from Douglas Aircraft Company and North American Aviation, Inc. Revised designs were presented again in 1954. The Boeing Airplane Company also submitted a design after the competition date had passed and was automatically rejected. The Martin 316 was declared the winner in 1956 and received the designation XB-68. Deployment was projected for the 1962-1965 period. With a conventional layout that somewhat resembled a scaled-up Lockheed F-104, the XB-68 was to have been primarily of steel construction, with the crew of a pilot-radio operator and navigator-bombardier defense systems operator in a pressurized compartment, to be cooled by filtered bleed-air from the engines, and a refrigeration unit for evaporative cooling at high Mach numbers. The B-68 would have had stubby diamond-shaped wings and a raked T-tail empennage. It was intended to be operated at supersonic speeds at medium and high altitudes. The design immediately ran into serious difficulties over the inertial guidance bombing and navigation system, which, had the bomber been approved for production, would have pushed deployment back to at least 1963. The problems were rendered moot when Air Force headquarters cancelled the project in 1957, citing stringent budget limitations and higher priorities for other weapon systems. Recognizing that the medium tactical bomber design was still years away, plans were carried forward instead to continue using an Air Force version of the Navy's Douglas A3D, which was designated B-66 Destroyer. Two planned XB-68 prototypes and one static test model were cancelled, and none were built. The chosen power plant was two Pratt & Whitney J75 (JT4B-21) axial-flow turbojets of static sea level thrust each with afterburner, providing a maximum speed of at altitude at maximum power and a combat speed of at altitude at maximum power. Combat range was planned for with payload at average speed in 4.15 hours.

This article gives a list of several names and terms of address used in France with respect to him. Charles de Gaulle, when he was fighting with his Free French forces, and when he was president, was a somewhat controversial person, and, to some extent, the way he was referred to indicated the political leanings of the speaker. While the political controversies have now largely ceased, some distinctions are still relevant today (for instance, the use of le G√©n√©ral almost always indicates that the speaker is a nostalgic Gaullist supporter). Names in current use * Charles Andr√© Joseph Marie de Gaulle: This is the formal full name of de Gaulle, the one used in his birth, marriage, and death certificates, the one used for official purposes when he was alive, such as for passports or other identity documents. This full name is never used in France nowadays. It does not even appear in French encyclopedias or dictionaries. * Charles de Gaulle: This is the regular name that de Gaulle used in everyday life, the name that is used in French encyclopedias and dictionaries, official documents, the name used when French people show a list of all their former presidents, etc. * le g√©n√©ral de Gaulle: This name originates from the promotion of de Gaulle to provisional brigadier general by Prime Minister Paul Reynaud in May 1940. After his rebellion in June 1940, de Gaulle never returned into the army, and became a political figure, thus never advancing to higher ranks of general. When he was prime minister or president he always refused to promote himself to higher ranks. Thus, one of the most famous French generals remained only a two-star general (as in France brigadier generals have two stars). De Gaulle was very much attached to his military past, and during his political career he often appeared with his two-star general's uniform, especially during critical moments such as the Putsch of Algiers in 1961. It was quite funny for French people to see a two-star general commanding authority over five-star generals. Indeed, during the Second World War, two-star general de Gaulle had been scorned by five-star generals who remained faithful to Vichy France. This may explain why de Gaulle remained attached to his two-star status, which was reminding the days of the Free French during the war. In France, le g√©n√©ral de Gaulle is now the most widely used term to refer to de Gaulle. Most avenues or streets which are called after de Gaulle use this term (e.g. avenue du g√©n√©ral de Gaulle), but there are some exceptions, such as Charles de Gaulle Airport (a√©roport de Roissy-Charles de Gaulle). In left- wing municipalities, when naming streets, Charles de Gaulle is sometimes preferred over g√©n√©ral de Gaulle, a term that has always irked the left, even though it is used all across the political spectrum nowadays. People who itch at the military, or who want to distance themselves from de Gaulle, use Charles de Gaulle instead of g√©n√©ral de Gaulle. Charles de Gaulle is supposedly more neutral, but g√©n√©ral de Gaulle is now so widely accepted that using Charles de Gaulle in conversation definitely carries a feeling of distance, or covert criticism. One could guess the feeling of someone toward Gaullism simply by watching whether they use g√©n√©ral de Gaulle or Charles de Gaulle. * le Pr√©sident de Gaulle was mainly used in formal circumstances when he was president. * le G√©n√©ral (\\"the general\\"): This is used by people most devoted to de Gaulle, especially people who personally knew him, or worked under him. This was the term used by the ministers of de Gaulle when they referred to him in private. They would never have said le pr√©sident. There is a feeling of partisanship (and now, nostalgia) attached to the word, and the left would never have used it. In France, when the phrase le g√©n√©ral is used alone, it is almost always understood as meaning de Gaulle. This phrase is nowadays hardly ever used except by elderly Gaullist supporters. * mon g√©n√©ral: This was used by ministers of de Gaulle and by his close supporters when addressing de Gaulle, but also by most journalists in the regular press interviews he gave ever since 1944. The left would have used Monsieur le pr√©sident instead. * mong√©n√©ral: This was, and still is, used by satirical publications such as the Canard Encha√Æn√© to caricature the devotion and, according to those publications, blind obedience and ideologic conformity that de Gaulle's followers had. * de Gaulle: This is used nowadays to refer to de Gaulle as a historical character, often with a tone of praise or respect, such as recent book C'√©tait de Gaulle (\\"Thus was de Gaulle\\"). In colloquial conversation, a Frenchman could say: \\"De Gaulle, c'√©tait quelqu'un ! \\" (\\"De Gaulle, now that was a man!\\"). In French, calling someone by their family name alone is considered derogatory when they are alive, but it is considered normal for historical figures when they are dead. * Monsieur Charles de Gaulle or Monsieur de Gaulle: This is never used. The last time it was used, probably, was when de Gaulle was in high school in the 1900s. His professors would have addressed him as Monsieur de Gaulle in formal circumstances, and as de Gaulle alone in informal circumstances. After high school, de Gaulle entered the military, and so he was addressed by his military rank at the time, followed by de Gaulle (lieutenant de Gaulle, etc.) Historical names * le colonel Motors: This is how de Gaulle was called by jokers in the French military in the 1930s. De Gaulle's proposals that the French army should emphasize the use of tanks and armored vehicles were scorned by the high command. Consequently, de Gaulle was refused promotions to the rank of general, and remained a colonel until the fall of France in June 1940, when his theories sadly proved right. This nickname of colonel Motors is a play on the General Motors Corporation name that translates as \\"The americans have the general Motors, we French must settle for the colonel Motors\\". In addition, the use of the English word \\"motor\\" was made on purpose to caricature de Gaulle as a reckless partisan of tanks because in French, English words had, and still have, a feeling of modernity, sometimes to the point of being too recklessly new. * Gaulle: This is how the military leaders of Vichy France called de Gaulle. They were scornful of a two-star general who pretended to be the incarnation of France in London. They took away the apparently aristocratic particle \\"de\\" (see French names) to belittle de Gaulle. Gaulle is also homophonic with the French word \\"gaule\\", the long pole that is used to harvest walnuts. This French word can also be understood in slang as meaning \\"dumb\\". * le grand Charles: This was used in political caricatures, referring to the tall height of de Gaulle (196 cm, 6'5\\"). Although used by caricaturists, there is often a friendly feeling to it, and it was used as the title for a 2006 TV-drama of his life. Nowadays, this phrase can still be heard sometimes, when people in casual conversation refer to de Gaulle, but with a little scornful tone in the voice (often it is pronounced with the voice trailing on \\"Charles\\"). * mon grand: Used in some famous satirical cartoons. A very famous one shows the Eiffel Tower welcoming de Gaulle during the Liberation of Paris, bending to embrace him, and calling him mon grand. Other cartoons in the 1960s show Marianne, the personification of France, casually conversing with de Gaulle, and calling him mon grand. In French, mon grand is the way a mother tenderly calls her son. * la grande Zohra: This is a derogatory expression that was used by the Europeans living in French Algeria and the people in favor of French Algeria. After de Gaulle opted for the independence of Algeria, he became the subject of much hatred among all the people who favored a French Algeria. \\"Zohra\\" is reportedly the way North African Arabs colloquially call the camel. Often this expression is associated in the mind with a drawing of de Gaulle dressed as an Arab woman, complete with earrings and veil, with only his big nose protruding from the veil. Perhaps there was the idea that de Gaulle was \\"prostituting\\" himself to the pro-independence Algerian rebellion. The use of the feminine, instead of the masculine, also has a diminutive effect in French. Today, the expression is still heard sometimes among the pied-noir community.Nickname originally used by French settlers in Algeria Le Nouvel Observateur 1976-02-09, section \\"Tableaux de chasse\\" * Viper: a reference to the captain Mike \\"Viper\\" Metcalf in Top Gun, used by French antimilitarists in the late 80's. The use of this reference may be seen as a paradox, as Charles de Gaulle was not really pro- American. Anyway, the peremptory behaviour of the captain in the movie suits very well to the general, according to his detractors. * Charlot: a reference to Charlie Chaplin character, used by opponents. * Big Moustache: a reference to the character of the British squadron leader in the French movie La Grande Vadrouille, used by young Frenchmen nowadays. This evokes the glorious British past of the general, and, of course, his world-known moustache. * le Conn√©table: He acquired this name when he was a prisoner of war in Germany during the Great War. It had come about because of the talks which he gave to fellow prisoners on the progress of the conflict. These were delivered with such patriotic ardour and confidence in victory that they called him by the title which had been given to the commander-in-chief of the French army during the monarchy. * la grande asperge: The great asparagus. De Gaulle spent four years studying and training at the elite military academy, Saint-Cyr. While there, and because of his height, high forehead, and nose, he acquired the nickname \\"the great asparagus\\".Gorman, Robert F. (ed.) (2008) \\"Charles de Gaulle\\" Great Lives from History: The 20th Century Salem Press, Pasadena, Calif. , * le melon-kilom√®tre: Another nickname from Saint-Cyr, coming from one initiation where one had to measure the courtyard using one's own body as a yardstick, and given his height, he managed to do it faster than others. * Cyrano: This nickname derives from his large nose and refers to Cyrano de Bergerac.Debray, R√©gis (1994) Charles de Gaulle: Futurist of the Nation translated by John Howe, Verso, New York, ; a translation of Debray, R√©gis (1990) A demain de Gaulle Gallimard, Paris, Notes See also * List of things named after Charles de Gaulle Category:Charles de Gaulle Category:Lists of names ","title":"List of names and terms of address used for Charles de Gaulle"},{"id":"1917188","text":"Nabil Shaban (born 12 February 1953Profile, screenonline.org.uk; retrieved 1 August 2011.) is a Jordanian-British actor and writer. He founded The Graeae‚Äîa theatre group which promotes performers with disabilities. Early years and career Shaban was born in Amman, Jordan. He was disabled by the brittle bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta and was sent to England for medical care, where he grew up in a series of hospitals and residential homes.Profile, unfinishedhistories.com; retrieved 31 October 2019. He studied at the University of Surrey in the late 1970s and contributed to the Students' Union newspaper \\"Bare Facts\\". In 1997, Shaban was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the university for services in the promotion of Disability Arts. One of his most memorable television roles was that of the reptilian alien Sil in the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who. Shaban played Sil in two serials: Vengeance on Varos (1985) and Mindwarp (1986), and created Sil's laugh. He reprised the role in the Big Finish audio dramas Mission to Magnus (2009) and Antidote to Oblivion (2013), both again written by Philip Martin. He has appeared in several films, including Born of Fire (1983), City of Joy (1992), Derek Jarman's Wittgenstein (1993), Gaias b√∏rn (1998), and Children of Men (2006), and has also worked as part of the Crass Collective. In 2011, he played the Roman emperor Constantius II at the National Theatre in Ibsen's Emperor and Galilean. In 2003 he made a TV documentary titled The Strangest Viking (part of Channel 4's Secret History series), in which Shaban explored the possibility that Viking chieftain Ivar the Boneless may have had osteogenesis imperfecta, the same condition he himself has. Shaban has also published a trilogy of Ivar the Boneless screenplays on Kindle, representing the Viking chieftain as a disabled Danish prince with brittle bones and unable to walk. Shaban was nominated Best Actor in Scottish theatre in 2005, by the Critics' Awards for Theatre in Scotland (CATS), for his role as Mack the Knife in Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera, a Theatre Workshop (Edinburgh) production. Shaban lost out to rival nominee David Tennant, who was about to become the new Doctor Who. Shaban's play The First To Go premi√®red in May 2008, produced by Edinburgh's Benchtours Theatre Company in association with Sirius Pictures. It opened at the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh on 23 May and toured to the Tron Theatre, Glasgow; the Byre Theatre, St Andrews and Lawrence Batley Theatre, Huddersfield.

Louvre Museum. Jean Denis Attiret (, 31 July 1702 - 8 December 1768) was a French Jesuit painter and missionary to China.  Early life  Attiret was born in Dole, France. He studied art in Rome and made himself a name as a portrait painter. While a Jesuit novice, he did paintings in the Cathedral of Avignon and the Sodality Chapel. He went to China in 1737 and was given the title Painter to the Emperor by the Qianlong Emperor. Because the emperor insisted on the use of a Chinese painting methods and styles, Attiret's painting eventually became entirely Chinese in style. Most of his works were paintings of natural subjects such as trees, fruit, fish and other animals done on glass or silk. But they also include portraits of members of the imperial family and court; altogether he is credited with at least 200 portraits.  Works  After successful military campaigns in Central Asia, the Qianlong Emperor commissioned depictions of the battles. The work was carried out by four Jesuit artists, among them Attiret. The group produced 16 tableaux, which were engraved in France in 1774, 6 years after Attiret's death in Beijing.

Front cover of the Perfect Diurnall for January 16‚Äì23, 1654, with which Mabbot was associated. Background Mabbot was the son of Edward Mabbot, a cobbler or cordwainer from Nottingham and had been appointed in 1643 as an assistant to John Rushworth who was clerk-assistant to the House of Commons and later Secretary to the Army. Mabbot became a prolific writer of newsletters to individual correspondents and assisted Rushworth in compiling the Historical Collections as a contemporary history of the civil war period. He appears to have assisted Samuel Pecke in compiling the Perfect Diurnall newsbook from 1642 to 1655. Army connections Rushworth had gathered much of his material from the primitive newsbooks which pioneered the publication of news, and which he encountered as part of his service as a licenser of the press. He used his influence to appoint Mabbot as his deputy from March 1645. Both were dismissed in March 1647 but Mabbot was appointed as Rushworth's successor on 30 September 1647 after a request from Thomas Fairfax, Commander-in-Chief of the Parliamentary Army. It is possible Mabbot was an ally of the Levellers, an important faction in the Army who wanted to declare a Republic, abolish the House of Lords, and institute a government which was purely democratic over the whole sphere of public life. As licenser of the press As licenser, Mabbot had the power to withhold a license to publish from those newsbooks which displeased him; however, he was progressively less successful. His name frequently appears on newsbooks of the period but was often used without his permission. He used his power to attempt to suppress the Moderate Intelligencer of John Dillingham in June 1648 after Dillingham inserted a brief sentence of French in the issue of 11 May 1648: \\"Dieu nous donne les Parlements briefe, Rois de vie longue.\\" Mabbot in addition made arrangements with the printers who had handled the Moderate Intelligencer to print in its stead a newsbook more in tune with Army policy. This he called The Moderate and numbered as if a continuation of the Moderate Intelligencer, even declaring \\"I have laid down my former title of 'Moderate Intelligencer' and do go by another, viz. 'The Moderate'\\". However, he was thwarted by Dillingham finding an alternative printer and successfully appealing to the House of Lords to stop Mabbot confusing his readers. Publication of The Moderate was moved to a different day of the week. It eagerly supported the abolition of the monarchy and welcomed the beheading of King Charles I; its account of the King's funeral is the most complete. Activities during the Commonwealth Mabbot was either dismissed or resigned his position as licenser of the press in May 1649, John Rushworth resuming his previous duties. During the Commonwealth Mabbot held important posts as official agent for the town of Leith and as supplier of news to the city of Kingston upon Hull. He was the brother-in-law of Sir William Clarke, Secretary to the Army, and kept in touch with him as a news source; he also regularly corresponded with Henry Cromwell, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Later life After the restoration of King Charles II, Mabbot obtained in January 1661 the office of manager for licences of wines and strong waters in Ireland. He moved to Dublin where his attempts to enforce licensing led to a complaint from members of the Holy Trinity Guild against his aggression. As a result of this complaint he agreed to surrender his office to the crown in June 1664 in return for ¬£4,800. Mabbot appears to have died in around 1670 when he was named in an Irish Chancery suit.

Originally designed simply as an electronic booking system, Choose and Book was developed to enable patient hospital choice. It was introduced into the NHS from 2005 onwards. It was procured as part of the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) in 2003. The contract was awarded to Schlumberger Limited's Sema division just before its acquisition by Atos Origin. The software is based on Cerner Corporation's Millennium e-Booking software. Surgery where immediate treatment is required is not in the remit of Choose and Book since such patients' needs bypass any longer-term queuing systems. Choose and Book has been replaced by the NHS e-Referral Service which was to have started in 2014 but was postponed until 2015 after it failed an assessment by the Government Digital Service. How Choose and Book works In its fully functional mode, Choose and Book communicated electronically between \\"compliant\\" GP Clinical Computer systems and Directly Bookable Hospital Patient Administration Systems (PAS) to enable GPs to shortlist appropriate services for their patients. This enabled patients to either book their appointment at their GP practice, call the national appointments line (originally on 0845 60 88888, and changed to 0345 60 88888 in mid-2010) or book their appointment online through the HealthSpace website. Directly Bookable Services refers to hospitals using Choose and Book compliant PAS systems. In this mode Choose and Book 'harvests' and displays appointment slots directly from the Hospital PAS for users to book directly into. Interim Solutions For a number of reasons a number of GP and hospital PAS Systems had not been made compliant in time to deliver the initial Choose and Book targets set by the Department of Health. Interim solutions were devised in 2005/6 to allow patients to benefit from Choose and Book where systems were not compliant. *Web Based Referral allowed a GP to access Choose and Book via a standard web browser until their Clinical Computing system can be successfully upgraded. *Indirectly Bookable Services involves telephone call handlers in hospitals to offer appointments to patients. The operator validates the patient's identity, offer a choice of available dates and times from the hospital's patient administration system and updates CaB with details of the patient's chosen appointment. Development The roll-out of Choose and Book in 2005 and 2006 suffered a number of delays; some technical because of its dependency on other NPfIT work streams, partly through functional problems in early releases, and partly through clinicians' concerns about additional workload. There were conflicting views about its effectiveness, both from a technical viewpoint (it is hard to distinguish between bugs in CaB and the systems with which it interfaces) and a service perspective (some users argue that it undermines existing good practice, while others praise the convenience and reduced delays it offers to patients). A 2006 survey (published 2008) found that the majority of patients were not experiencing the degree of choice that the system was designed to deliver. To increase the uptake of Choose and Book by doctors in England, surgeries were offered a financial incentive for the first part of 2006, but it continued to suffer from adverse publicity in the medical press and resistance from a number of GPs. As the application became more stable during 2005 and 2006, booking volumes increased, albeit more slowly than planned. At December 2006, over 1.5M patients had used Choose and Book. By the end of October 2008, this had risen to over 10M bookings, with daily figures of over 20,000. All primary care trusts in England were live with Choose and Book (although that might only be one GP within a PCT or practice), while all NHS acute trusts and a large number of independent sector hospitals used Choose and Book. At 28 October 2008, 93% of practices were providing the service, and while some PCTs are only seeing low volumes (30% and less in some cases), many were booking 70 to 80% of patients using Choose and Book. Use reached a high point nationally of 57% of referrals in the first two months of 2010. As incentive schemes were scaled back there was a drop in use to 50% at the start of 2012. When the system was turned off in June 2015 it was used by 40,000 patients every day. Extended Choice Network In January 2007 private Hospitals started making their services directly bookable to GPs whose PCT had commissioned their services. From April 2007, the 'Extended Choice Network' included all NHS foundation trusts and independent sector hospitals accredited by the Department of Health as meeting NHS quality and cost criteria. This meant that a GP could, via CaB, offer their patients the choice of four or more local providers, and the option of any Foundation Trust or accredited independent sector hospital in England. The Government's intention was that when patients were able to choose between their local NHS Hospital and any accredited private hospital in England, standards would rise (known as 'contestability'). In March 2007 the first independent sector hospitals became available as directly bookable options from within Choose and Book. From April 2008, 'Free Choice' policy meant that patients could choose from any clinically appropriate and accredited provider in England. Since the deployment of Release 4.0 of the application in May 2008, referrers could select from two menus: \\"Search Primary Care\\", which only showed services provided by the PCT or by smaller local providers, or \\"Search All\\", which showed services provided by all accredited providers in England. One criticism of this policy is that patients and their referring clinicians needed more meaningful information to make a genuinely informed choice, some of which is provided by the NHS website \\"Find and Choose a Hospital\\" comparison feature.

Dedina lives in Imperial Beach with his wife Emily and sons Daniel and Israel. Dedina is a former lifeguard and self-proclaimed avid surfer. Apart from his mayoral duties, Dedina manages Wildcoast at its Imperial Beach headquarters. Activism He is the former Northwest Mexico Program Manager for The Nature Conservancy's Baja California Program. In his capacity as director Dedina lobbied for the development of the San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park in Baja California, Mexico. In 1988, Dedina successfully lobbied the Mexican government for San Ignacio Lagoon, a gray whale breeding zone, to be included in the El Vizca√≠no Biosphere Reserve. Controversies In 2005, Dedina's Wildcoast launched a media campaign starring former Playboy Playmate Dorismar in a series of provocative posters proclaiming \\"Sea turtle eggs DO NOT increase sexual potency!\\" The advertisements featured Dorismar in revealing thong underwear exposing her bare buttocks. These advertisements drew ire from women's rights groups, and several environmental groups refused to be associated with the campaign. In 2016, Dedina issued a citywide proclamation declaring Imperial Beach to be a \\"Welcoming City\\" and directed \\"city departments to [...] help provide services to families legally relocating to the City of Imperial Beach.\\" Many Imperial Beach residents interpreted the language of the proclamation as a veiled attempt at labeling Imperial Beach as a Sanctuary city. Due to a large outpouring of community outrage the Mayor was forced to rescind his proclamation after significant citizen backlash at an open city forum.

The mythology dates back at least to the pre-Christian era (7th century) and was known in the present-day regions of the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of France. In some places they were known as Juffers or Joffers (\\"ladies\\"), or as Dames Blanches (White Ladies) in French. Origins Witte wieven in modern Dutch Low Saxon literally translates to \\"white women\\", but originally meant \\"wise women\\". \\"Wit\\" or \\"witte\\" meant wise in a way similar to the English \\"witty\\". Witte wieven is still often translated to \\"white woman\\", as the words come from the same roots. The association of wise women with the color white was either an accidental translation error, or a symbolic color association for wisdom (sources differ). Historically, the witte wieven are thought to be wise female herbalists and medicine healers who took care of people's physical and mental ailments. It was said they had the talent for prophecy and looking into the future. They had a high status in the communities, and so when they died ceremonies were held at their grave sites to honour them. According to mythology, their spirits remained on earth, and they became living spirits (or elven beings) that either helped or hindered people who encountered them. They tended to reside in the burial sites or other sacred places. It was thought that mist on a gravehill was the spirit of the wise woman appearing, and people would bring them offerings and ask for help. While many scholars believe Witte Wieven originated as above from honoring graves of wise women, others think the mythology of witte wieven come from part of the Germanic belief in disen, land wights, and/or alven (Dutch for \\"elf\\") for several reasons: The practice of bringing offerings and asking for help from their graves is very similar to honoring disen, land wights and alfen in Germanic paganism. In addition, in some localities the mythological witte wieven were described directly as \\"Alfen\\" or \\"Alven\\". Jacob Grimm mentioned them in the Deutsche Mythologie (1835) as the Dutch variant of the German Wei√üe Frauen: \\"The people of Friesland, Drenthe and the Netherlands have just as much to tell of their witten wijven or juffers in hills and caverns ... though here they get mixed up with elvish personages.\\"Grimm 1835:3. Characterization At first, early medieval literature described the witte wieven more like pranksters and pests. Later Christian teaching transformed the idea of a \\"witte wieven\\" into mistflarden (wisps of mist or fog): ghost witches -- recharacterized as evil and to be avoided. In certain legends \\"Alvinne\\" was a ghost in a white cloak. Legacy The following places were named after witte wieven, and report witte wieven legends: In the Netherlands: * Near the Village of Eefde is Wittewievenbult: this translates as \\"Wise Women Hill\\". Local legend holds that White Women appear on Christmas Eve every year and dance on this hill.\\"Heathen History of Achterhoek\\", 2002. * Near the Village of Barchem is Wittewijvenkuil: this translates as \\"Wise Woman Pit\\". It is a pit between two local hills. Local legend holds that three white women lived there.\\"Heathen History of Achterhoek\\": 2002.

She was best known for her social commentary photography which recorded the lives of working class Americans in the 1930s and 1940s. Biography She was born Johanna Mieth in Oppelsbohm, Germany, one of three daughters of a strict, religious family. She ran away from home at the age of 15 and did factory work before emigrating to the United States in 1930 to join her lover and fellow photographer Otto Hagel (1909‚Äì1973). The couple found themselves in the midst of the Great Depression and worked as migrant farm labourers for several years. During that time they began to photograph the brutal working conditions and suffering they saw around them, after acquiring a second-hand Leica camera. In San Francisco, Sacramento, and in the rural towns they worked in, they photographed the bitter labour strikes and the working homeless. They were involved with the San Francisco Film and Photo League during the early 1930s. They also became acquainted with working photographers and began to sell their own photographs to magazines. In 1937 Mieth joined the staff of LIFE Magazine (only the second woman photographer to do so), and she and Otto (whom she married in 1940), moved to New York. He was then still a German citizen, so in order to escape internment during the Second World War the couple fled to a remote ranch near Santa Rosa in northern California. Mieth continued to accept photography assignments for LIFE, while Hagel never left the Singing Hills Ranch. During World War II Mieth photographed Japanese Americans who had been taken from their homes and interned by the Roosevelt government. In the early 1950s, the couple's refusal to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (where they would have been required to name names of their friends in the labour movement) led to Mieth's losing her job at LIFE, and to their being unofficially blacklisted. Shunned by their former friends, the couple retired to their ranch in California where they raised livestock and where Mieth took up painting. She died in Santa Rosa California in 1998. Mieth's life story was told in a one-hour documentary titled Hansel Mieth: Vagabond Photographer, directed by Nancy Schiesari, which aired on PBS' Independent Lens series in 2003. The full archive of Hansel Mieth's work is located at the Center for Creative Photography (CCP) at the University of Arizona in Tucson, which also manages the copyright of her work.

The presence of safety wiring may also serve to indicate that the fasteners have been properly tightened. Safety wire is available in a variety of gauges and materials, depending on the application. In aircraft and racing applications, stainless steel wire is used, such as in diameter. Typically, the wire is threaded through a hole drilled into a fastener or part, then twisted and anchored to a second fastener or part, then twisted again.  Application  =Principle= There are a few techniques for different applications. The word safetying is a term universally used in the aircraft industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: \\"Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation.\\" These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. The wire itself maintains tension and remains in place by being twisted around itself and attached to the fastener to be secured on one end and an anchor point (which could be another fastener) on the other end. Since safety wire is made of a malleable alloy, it retains its shape after being bent, rather than springing back to its original shape. This property allows it to remain locked around an object, such as when it is passed through a small hole on a fastener, looped back upon itself and then twisted. The same process is then repeated around the anchor point, which could be another fastener. Since it remains twisted instead of unraveling, it acts as a fixed loop and will not back out without considerable force (greater than the stresses which it is intended to counter) being applied.Reference AC 43.13-1B, Section 7. Safetying, Figure 7-3a. A moused shackle Mousing (pronounced ) is the application of a molly or safety wire, called mousing wire in this use, to secure a threaded clevis pin to a shackle. This is done by passing a couple of turns of mousing wire through the reach-hole provided for this purpose in the unthreaded end of the clevis pin and around the body of the shackle's hoop. Alternatively, some threaded shackles are provided with a hole through the threaded end of the pin beyond where it emerges from the threaded hole. A cotter pin or a couple of loops of mousing wire through this hole serves the same purpose and secures the shackle in a closed position. Nylon zip ties are also commonly used in applications where the shackle must be secured, but easy removal is required. =Use= A safety wire is used to ensure proper security for a fastener. The wire needed is long enough to reach from a fixed location to a hole in the removable fastener, such as a pin ‚Äî a clevis fastener, sometimes a linchpin or hitch-pin through a clevis yoke for instance ‚Äî and the wire pulled back upon itself, parallel to its other end, then twisted, a single end inserted through a fastener, and twisted again, possibly then anchored to a second fastener or other part, then twisted once again, having excess slack pulled relatively taut to be secure. The two ends of the wire-loop thus formed are joined by twisting them together with a tool, using enough twists to be secure, then released from the twisting tool. The removable fastener ‚Äî possibly a nut, wing nut, turnbuckle, a bolt or a pin similar to a bolt ‚Äî having a hole through a part of it that will remain accessible when it is fastened in place will be secured with the wire passing through it. When finished, any excess length of wire would be cut off with a pair of wire cutters, such as pliers that may, also, be the twisting tool. If the fastener part to be secured does not come with a hole for the safety wire, one may need to be drilled. Safety wire is not reusable, thus it can be cut apart in order to remove it easily when the fastener is to be opened. =Proper techniques= When using a most common gauge of safety wire, which is 0.032 inches, guidance for installation can be found in several publicly available sources.FAA AC 43.13-1B, Section 7MS33540FAA AC 43.13-1B, Section 7, Figure 7-3a identifies only 6 to 8 twists per inch. 43.13-1B has no other reference to twists per inch either by hand twisting with special tools.Aviation Mechanic Handbook, 6th edition, written by Dale Crane and published by ASA identifies different twists per inch as 0.020‚Äì0.025 inches at 8‚Äì14 twists per inch, 0.032‚Äì0.041 inches at 6‚Äì11 twists per inch, and 0.051‚Äì0.060 inches at 4‚Äì8 twists per inch. The safety wire should be threaded through the object fastener such that it creates tension in the opposite direction of the fastener's removal. For example, if a standard automotive bolt in the U.S. is being secured, then the safety wire when installed should put tension on the bolt in a clockwise direction, since that is the direction that the bolt turns to tighten.SAE AS 567 When drilling a fastener, the choice of where to drill it depends on the type of fastener and to what it will be wired. The alternative to drilling holes in fasteners is to use safety wire tabs (see Safety wire tabs section below), or to purchase pre-drilled fasteners. =Witness wire= A more simplistic application of safety wire, more commonly referred to as witness wiring, is the use of light gauge, single strand, copper wire to provide positive visual confirmation of the security or closure of specific equipment within the aerospace industry. Common applications include the security of safety equipment such as fire extinguishers, and safety equipment bags, but also as an assurance that critical system switch covers remain in place, such as those associated with the application of fire suppression, or ejection systems. This application of witness wires is widely varied, and may cover a broad range of types of equipment and numerous situations. Witness wires also serve the purpose of providing a rapid method for ensuring critical safety equipment or systems have not been used or tampered with since their last repair, reset, or inspection, and also that the container of such equipment has not been inadvertently opened, disturbed or tampered with, therefore providing confidence in their readiness for use. In a similar manner, critical system switch covers are protected from inadvertent activation, through the application of witness wire. The gauge of copper wire utilized in this application is such that the wire security can be overcome with minimal breaking force by hand, without damage to the equipment or persons, and once broken, remains affixed to the equipment without the introduction of foreign object damage (FOD). Typically the wire is threaded through existing holes in the associated equipment, using a single strand loop, and a single crossover, such that the closure is secured without impedance to the normal functioning of the equipment. The single crossover provides the appropriate friction such that the wire cannot fall completely free of the equipment when broken. The loose ends of the strand may be twisted in a pigtail fashion, or crimped with a lead seal, securing both strands as close to the closure as practical. In each case, the loose ends of the strands should be tucked neatly away from inadvertent impact. Equipment A one-pound spool of 0.020\\" stainless steel safety wire. =Safety wire= Safety wire is commonly in diameter, but diameters are also available. It is usually made of stainless steel, but is also available in monel and inconel alloys for high temperature applications and copper for break-away applications. For consumer applications, it is typically sold in spools enclosed in a small cardboard or plastic canister. =Safety wire twisters= A \\"pignose\\" safety wire twister A safety wire twister is a simple tool that allows the user to grip the two loose ends of a piece of safety wire and then, while holding the main barrel of the tool, turn the end that is not gripping the wire (which is bent to create a simple cranking mechanism) in order to twist the safety wire. There is another type of basic safety wire twister which is similar to a standard screwdriver, except that the tip has a small grasping mechanism to hold the ends of the wire while the technician turns the handle to twist the wire. The advantage to this tool is its long and thin design, which can access hard-to-reach areas where one's hands or pliers do not fit. It is commonly referred to as a \\"pignose\\" due to its snout-like appearance. =Safety wire tabs= Safety wire tabs are washers that are used to secure fasteners by transferring the force of the safety wire to the head of the fastener to be secured. They are installed just like any other washer, after which the sides of the tab are bent up to make contact with the sides of the head of the fastener. One side of the tab is longer than the other with a small hole at the top, through which safety wire is threaded. Once the safety wire is properly installed, the sides of the tab transfer the force of the safety wire to the fastener, as though the fastener itself had been drilled and had the safety wire run through it. The advantage of safety wire tabs is that the fastener to be secured does not need to be drilled, which can be advantageous for fasteners that should not or cannot be drilled because of size or damage concerns. They can also be useful when a fastener needs to be replaced, the replacement is not already drilled, and circumstances do not afford the time or tools to properly prepare the replacement fastener. The disadvantages are that it adds extra distance between the head of the fastener and the surface to which it is to be secured, and it is not as secure as securing the wire directly to the fastener itself as the tab could be a point of failure if it somehow unbends or the hole breaks (which is more likely than the hole in a drilled fastener failing due to the thinness and malleability of the material from which it is made). =Pre-drilled fasteners= For certain applications where safety wiring is common, fasteners come pre-drilled with holes to accept safety wire. When wiring something that did not come with pre-drilled fasteners stock, however, the more cost-effective way (as opposed to replacing all stock fasteners with pre-drilled ones of the same type) is often to drill the stock fasteners. =Drilling jigs= Because the use of twisted safety wire to secure fasteners requires the fasteners to be drilled, tool makers offer drill jigs to help technicians drill the fasteners to be secured. Although pre- drilled fasteners can be obtained, most fasteners to be secured start out never having been intended to be secured (e.g., a production motorcycle which was built for the street but which has been converted into a race-bike). Such fasteners need to be drilled. Drilling them is often difficult as, due to their small size and irregular shape, securing them properly and applying a drill effectively can be trying. As a result, technicians often break drill bits or damage the fastener when the bit slides off position. A useful tool is a drill press, because it allows the technician to apply the force of the drill bit directly to the fastener being drilled and eliminates lateral movement; but even with a press the fastener needs to be secured to prevent it from sliding out from beneath the bit. Even though drill presses ease the process, a press isn't always available, such as at a race event; and even with a press, the problem of securing the fastener still exists. To solve those problems, jigs are available which are designed to securely hold the fastener while providing a guide-channel for a drill bit (with either a hand drill or a press) so that the technician can easily and directly apply force from the drill to the fastener without having it slip off or breaking the bit. Proprietary methods Safety cable is an alternative to safety wire. Safety cable is defined as a group of strands right-hand helically twisted without a core. This eliminates the need for twisting during installation, as is required with safety wire. Several companies manufacture safety cable, and it is becoming an industry standard due to easier control of critical inputs and reduced installation time. Installation and quality requirements of safety cable are governed by SAE AS4536.SAE AS4536 One system works by providing pre- cut lengths of safety wire that have a large cap on one end. The cable is threaded through a hole on the fastener to be secured, which is large enough to accommodate the wire but too small for the cap on the other end of the cable to pass through it. After the other end of the wire is passed through the anchor point, the technician takes an extra end cap and the special tool that is available from Daniels and crimps the cap on to that end of the wire. Again, the end cap is too large to pass through the hole that the wire passed through, and thus the cable is secured. Advantages and disadvantages Safety wire pliers Although many systems purport to be more efficient than installing traditional safety wire, an advantageous by-product of the twisting method of installing safety wire is that it leaves a highly visible and easily inspectable indication that the fasteners in question are in fact properly secured. In addition, safety wire twisting is a standard, non-proprietary technique, and tools and materials can be easily found, cheaply purchased, and mixed with other brands while still working properly (provided of course that all components are used properly and with the proper types of complementary components and tools, if not brands). The primary disadvantage of traditional safety wire is the time it requires to install properly when securing fasteners, although technicians who use it often can implement it fairly quickly. It also leaves behind waste products when ends are clipped off or when it is cut off secured fasteners that need to be removed during maintenance, resulting in sharp metal bits that can easily damage soft materials or injure skin. However, the amount of waste product is relatively small, it is non-toxic, and the hazard can be mitigated altogether if technicians properly dispose of any waste product. When clipping off ends, the ends can go flying off which makes their recovery difficult and can cause injury to anyone in the immediate vicinity, such as the technician or an assistant; however, this can also be easily mitigated by using extra care or by using safety wire pliers that have a special insert that is designed to catch clipped off ends. Another disadvantage is that since the manual skill required to implement traditional safety wire is easily learned, the techniques required to maximize the retentive force of safety wire (e.g., in which direction the retentive force should be exerted, the direction of twist, proper angles for securing multiple fasteners, proper twists per inch, which type of wire to use, etc.) are often ignored by non-formally trained technicians (e.g., hobbyists) who use safety wire for their projects. Alternatives There are also other systems of fastener retention that do not rely on safety wire at all, such as lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.

With five air victories,Jackson 2003, p. 57. along with Lydia Litvyak, she was one of the world's two female fighter aces. She was shot down by either Luftwaffe ace Georg Schwientek of JG 52 or ace Emil Bitsch, of JG 3. Early life Budanova was born into a peasant family in Konoplanka village in Smolensk Oblast. After leaving elementary school with the highest grades, she had to abandon her studies due to her father's death, and began working as a nanny. At the age of thirteen her mother sent her to join her sister in Moscow, where she began working as a carpenter in an aircraft factory.Milanetti, p. 126. It was there that she began an interest in aviation, and she joined an aeroclub's parachutist section, obtaining her flying license in 1934 and graduating to flight instructor in 1937. She took part in several air parades, flying the single-seater Yakovlev UT-1. Yakovlev UT-1: Katya Budanova flew this type of aircraft in several air parades over Moscow before the Great Patriotic War World War II After the German attack on the USSR in June 1941, she enlisted in military aviation and was assigned to the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, formed by Marina Raskova. This unit consisted entirely of female pilots and was equipped with Yak-1. Initially, all women pilots were placed into three all-women units: the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, the 587th Dive Bomber Regiment, and the 588th Night Bomber Regiment. The 500 designations were originally meant to signify defense reserves. These units were originally made up women who were flight instructors or members of pre-war flying clubs. The 586th (under Major Tamara Kazarinova) saw combat action in the spring of 1942 in the rear. In May 1942 the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment redeployed to Anisovka where it was assigned to the 144th Fighter Aviation Division covering the railway installations near Saratov, and it was here Budanova flew her first combat missions. But, as the Battle of Stalingrad raged, the supply of replacement male pilots was drying up and thus, seeing the skill of these women, the Soviet High Command began dispersing selected female pilots to existing male units. On 10 September, Budanova was assigned with Lydia Litvyak, Mariya Kuznetsova, and Raisa Belyayeva to the 437th Fighter Aviation Regiment, based in Verkhnania Akhtuba on the east bank of the Volga river engaged in the fighting over Stalingrad. The 437th was a LaGG-3 regiment, under Major Khvostikov, who was initially skeptical of the ability of women pilots. But in a short time Budanova became known for her aggressive attacking and high piloting skill. Restored Messerschmitt Bf 109G: The first plane shot down by Katya Budanova was reportedly an aircraft of this type According to some historians, she shot down her first opponent ‚Äî a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter ‚Äî on 14 September 1942, combining forces with Lydia Litvyak.Seidl 1998, p. 135. According to regiment archivist Ekaterina K. Polunina on 2 October 1942 Budanova achieved her two first solo air victories, shooting down a Junkers Ju 88 and a Bf 109.Polunina 2004, p. 138. However, Budanova's aircraft mechanic, Inna Pasportnikova, wrote that she shot down her first aircraft on 6 October when she attacked thirteen Ju 88 bombers, downing one.Cottam 1998, pp. 267‚Äì268. From October until January 1943 Budanova and Litvyak served in the Stalingrad area with the elite 9th Guards Fighter Regiment, commanded by Lev Shestakov, a Hero of Soviet Union. This regiment consisted either of aces or people considered potential aces.Cottam 1998-Selected Biographies, p. 150. One of them was Vladimir Lavrinenkov, who ended the war with 46 victories (11 shared).Polak 1999, p. 196. He later recalled that Budanova \\"was tall, kept her hair cut short,... and in her flightsuit hardly stood out from the fellows.\\" He characterized Budanova as a \\"cheerful, lively character\\" while Litvyak looked \\"thoughtful and quiet\\". Both he said were excellent pilots. Initially the two women had flown together, but then more often flew separately as wingmen to other pilots. While in the Stalingrad area, an order was received citing the return of the women aircrew to the 586th. Pasportnikova later recalled, \\"Budanova and Litvyak appealed to Lt.Col Shestakov, the commander of the 9th Guards Fighter Regiment, with a request to let them remain in the regiment.\\" They were allowed to stay, remaining with 9th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment for over three months. On 10 December Budanova shot down two Messerschmitt Bf 110s. In the following months she was credited with several more aircraft. Bf 110; Budanova shot down two aircraft of this type on 10 December 1942, her first double kill In January 1943 the 9th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment was re-equipped with the US-built P-39 \\"Airacobra\\" and Budanova and Litvyak moved to the 296th Fighter Aviation Regiment (later the 73rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment) of Nikolai Baranov, and continued to fly the Yak. It was with 73rd Fighter Aviation Regiment that Budanova and Litvyak achieved the bulk of their combat claims. Budanova was selected to fly with Baranov, while squadron commander Alexei Solomatin took Litvyak as wingman. Budanova was soon given permission for \\"solo hunting\\", an honor given to aggressive and successful pilots. On 10 February 1943, near Rostov on Don, she shot down a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 along with Senior Lieutenant Nikolay Demkin and the wingman, Lieutenant Boris Gorkhiver. On 23 February she was awarded with an Order of the Red Star. On 9 March 1943 between 17.30 and 18.30 she claimed a Bf 109 along with Lieutenant Oleg Filipchenko. On 20 April 1943 Ogonek, a political-literary weekly publication intended for young adults, featured a cover photo of Budanova and Litvyak. An article detailed their accomplishments, honoring their collective, rather than individual, achievements. The magazine gave a combined number of combat missions and kills to date for the two pilots. On 30 May under command of Soshnikov, Budanova shared in the destruction of another Bf 109. By June 1943 Budanova had six victories to her credit, and operating near Rostov on Don during the liberation of Donbas, heavy air combat saw her claims raised to 11.Polak 1999, p. 97. Last mission On 19 July 1943 she flew her last mission, near Novokrasnovka. That morning she took off for an escort mission and near Antratsit in Luhansk Oblast she was involved in a dogfight with Bf 109s. Inna Pasportnikova later recalled: > \\"She spotted three Messerschmitt going on the attack against a group of > bombers. Katia attacked and diverted the enemy. A desperate fight developed > in the air. Katia managed to pick up an enemy aircraft in her sight and > riddle him with bullets. This was the fifth aircraft she killed personally. > Katia's fighter rapidly soared upward and swooped down on a second enemy > aircraft. She \\"stitched\\" it with bullets, and the second Messer, streaming > black smoke, escaped to the west. But Katia's red starred fighter had been > hit; tongues of flame were already licking at the wings.\\" Budanova managed to put out the fire and force landed in no-man's land. By the time local farmers came to pull her from the aircraft, she was already dead. They buried her on the outskirts of the village of Novokrasnovka. The pilot who shot her down was either Georg Schwientek of JG 52 or Emil Bitsch, of 8./JG 3, the only two pilots that claimed a Yak-1 in the Novokrasnovka area on 19 July 1943. Controversies about number of victories There have been several different versions of Budanova's aerial victory score published, with no official tally. The most common quoted is for 11 kills (6 individual and 5 shared). According to some historians she achieved 11 individual air victories.Seidl 1998, p. 324. Pasportnikova has stated that Budanova had five personal kills at the time of her death. She was twice awarded Order of the Patriotic War. Although she was nominated for the title of Hero of the Soviet Union during the war, she never received it. On 1 October 1993, she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation. Russian aviation historians Andrey Simonov and Svetlana Chudinova dispute Budanova's status as a flying ace, noting that official documents record that she had only three victories.

Early life and family  Jessica Nelson North was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the daughter of David Willard North and Sarah Elizabeth \\"Elizabeth\\" (Nelson) North. She grew up on the shore of Lake Koshkonong near to what later became St. Joseph's College in the vicinity of Edgerton, Wisconsin. She was the older sister of Sterling North, author of Rascal and many other children's books. Jessica Nelson North is one of the major characters portrayed in her brother's well-known book, which was set when she was 25. Jessica and Sterling's family home (the setting of Rascal) in Edgerton has been restored to its 1917 setting and is open as a museum. Sterling North recalled (in Rascal, Chapter 2) that \\"Both sisters had taken tender care of me after Mother died, Jessica in particular, postponing her career and marriage.\\" Jessica's grandparents, James Hervey Nelson and Sarah Orelup Nelson, were Wisconsin pioneers. In 1917, which would have been her grandfather James Hervey Nelson's 100th birthday, several of North's uncles wrote extended biographies about their parents and their pioneer farm life. These writing efforts may have been a literary inspiration to both her and Sterling. Jessica was the aunt of author Arielle North Olson who was Sterling's daughter. Jessica was also the niece of Justus Henry Nelson, an early missionary in the Amazon. Genealogy was one of Jessica Nelson North's avocations. Education and marriage She received a bachelor's degree from Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin, where she was a member of Alpha Delta Pi, and went on to graduate school at the University of Chicago. North married Reed Inness MacDonald on June 11, 1921 in Edgerton, Wisconsin and had two children. Writing career During college, North was the president of the University of Chicago Poetry Club and was the editor of the Adelphean and the History of Alpha Delta Pi. North published her first novel, Arden Acres, in 1935. It is a family drama and social commentary set in the Great Depression told from the point of view of the oldest daughter of a family in the fictional Arden Acres, Illinois. She also published Miss Missouri, The Long Leash(1928), The Prayer Rug and The Pocket. Her poem about a child's tea party is one of her most beloved works. It starts: In the thirties and forties, North was an editor at Poetry magazine, one of the leading poetry magazines of the English speaking world.

The most common gelcoats are thermosetting polymers based on epoxy or unsaturated polyester resin chemistry. Gelcoats are modified resins which are applied to moulds in the liquid state. They are cured to form crosslinked polymers and are subsequently backed with thermoset polymer matrix composites which are often mixtures of polyester resin and fiberglass, or epoxy resin which is most commonly used with carbon fibre for higher specific strength. The manufactured component, when sufficiently cured and removed from the mould, presents the gelcoated surface. This is usually pigmented to provide a coloured, glossy surface which improves the aesthetic appearance of the article, such as the surface of a boat hull. Many marine craft and some aircraft are manufactured using composite materials with an outer layer of gelcoat, typically 0.5 mm to 0.8 mm (0.02 in to 0.03 in) thick. Gelcoats are designed to be durable, providing resistance to ultraviolet degradation and hydrolysis. Specialized gelcoats can be used to manufacture the moulds which in turn are used to manufacture components. These require very high levels of durability to overcome the mechanical and thermal stresses encountered during the curing and demoulding processes. Suitable resin chemistries for the manufacture of gelcoats vary, but the most commonly encountered are unsaturated polyesters or epoxies. Within each of these categories, the resin chemistries are further subdivided. In addition to any pigment a gelcoat will, if necessary, contain a thixotropic additive to assist its tenacity to vertical portions of the mould whilst it cures.

As of 2009, it was licensed for 509 beds, but held only around 200 patients. The current building is 17 stories tall.\\"Manhattan Psychiatric Center - New York, NY\\", Hospital Data website The building strongly resembles that of the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens. History The hospital's roots date to 1848 when Wards Island was designated the reception area for immigrants. Some additional structures were originally part of Blackwell's Island Lunatic Asylum, which opened around 1863. The New York City Asylum for the Insane opened in 1863.New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, \\"Wards Island Park\\" The building was significantly enlarged in 1871, and a Kirkbride Plan style building was built. After the immigration entry shifted to Ellis Island in 1892, the state took it over from Manhattan in 1899 and expanded it even further, renaming it the Manhattan State Hospital. At the time, it had 4,400 beds and was the largest psychiatric hospital in the world. At the time, it was one of two psychiatric hospitals for residents of Manhattan that had been taken over by the state. The other psychiatric hospital would become the Central Islip Psychiatric Center in Central Islip, New York. Both hospitals were referred to as \\"Manhattan State Hospital\\". It later became the Manhattan Psychiatric Center. The current building complex was constructed in 1954. The facility is run and operated by the New York State Office of Mental Health.

The former University Hill Secondary School.  History  University Hill School began as a kindergarten to grade 12 school in September, 1927, on the site of what is now University Hill Elementary School. The K-12 school remained on that site until 1954, when the secondary school split from the elementary school and was built on a site on Acadia Road. Both schools were run by its own unique school board from 1927‚Äì1971, by special UEL elections. In 1971, the Schools joined the Vancouver School Board. In 2013 the school moved to a new, larger building in Wesbrook Place in UBC. The former location became the location for the newly established Norma Rose Point Elementary. The school is situated next to Pacific Spirit Regional Park. University Hill's school colour is purple. There are two logos, one is historical and popular, with UHS on a traditional shield; and the other is a stylized hawk symbolizing an affinity with nature and a commitment to action. 2003 marked the 75th anniversary of University Hill Secondary School. Academic Record Since the school moved into a brand new facility on the UBC campus, the school's test scores have dropped considerably. In 2017 the school was rated 6.1/10.0, in 2018 the school was rated 5.2/10.0, and in 2019 the school was rated 5.3/10. The school is ranked 167th in BC, according to the Fraser Institute. In the past the school was ranked as the number one public secondary school in British Columbia, according to the Fraser Institute.http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=8d59d642-7207-4c71-8582-06a04f741ccf At one point it even scored a perfect score. However, the ranking's methodology is controversial. Athletics University Hill offers a variety of sports to its students including volleyball, soccer, rugby, table tennis, badminton and basketball, but fail to find success in most of the listed. In the fall, Junior and Senior Girls Volleyball is played in Vancouver Secondary Schools' leagues as well as Senior Boys' soccer. In the winter, basketball and table tennis are offered for both boys and girls. Boys' Volleyball, girls' soccer, and boys' and girls' tennis are offered in the spring. In addition, badminton is also offered throughout the year. All school teams are known as the U-Hill Hawks. In 1999-2000, The Hawks became provincial champions in swimming. Their team won by a landslide, setting several new records in both individual and relay events. All but one of the 9 records held by the U-Hill swim team are still standing. Ironically, there hasn't been a swim team since the Provincials in 2000. The U-Hill track and field team placed third in the cities in 2008. Their junior boys team came in first overall in 2007 and 2009. The U-Hill golf team was started up in 2007-2008 year and in the spring of 2009 U-Hill won City Championships. However they were neglected from the AAA golf provincials for having been registered as a AA school. The U-Hill senior boys soccer team won the AA city championships in 1999 and 2004. They also made it to the city finals in the years 2006 and 2007. In 2014 the U-Hill girl's table tennis team took home the provincial championship beating out Burnaby North Secondary School in team competition and Magee Secondary School in singles competition.https://sites.google.com/site/bcssttc/past-results In 2017, the juvenile boys basketball team finished 2nd in Vancouver and 10th in the province.

It is around from Kinshasa by air, or about by road. In 2009, Bandundu had an estimated population of 133,080. Economy Bandundu was once a significant river port, as it is the largest town on the river between Kinshasa and Kikwit. However, traffic on the Kasai and Kwango Rivers dropped dramatically as a result of the Second Congo War, and has yet to recover. Bandundu does have intermittent passenger and freight service to Kinshasa, Mushie and Kikwit. Since 2008, there is a car/truck ferry service running several times per day across the Kwango. An unpaved road, roughly 250 km long, runs from this point to the main (paved) highway between Kinshasa and Kikwit. Bandundu is served by Bandundu Airport, with direct flights to Kinshasa.

It is situated at a lagoon (Bodden) of the Baltic Sea facing the Fischland-Darss-Zingst peninsula. Barth belongs to the district of Vorpommern-R√ºgen. It is close to the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park. In 2011, it held a population of 8,706.Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Statistical Office - Population Census from December 31, 2011 (XLS, German) History Historical view of Barth in 1618, from the Lubin map made by Eilhard Lubinus Former abbey of Barth Barth dates back to the medieval German Ostsiedlung, before which the area was settled by Wends of the Liuticians or Rani tribe. Jaromar II, Danish prince of R√ºgen, granted the town L√ºbeck law in 1255. In the same document, he agreed to remove his burgh, Borgwall or Neue Burg, then on the northwestern edge of the town's projected limits. Another Wendish burgh, Alte Burg near today's train station, was not used anymore. The German town was set up on empty space between the burghs. Not a member of the Hanseatic League, the town never grew to the importance and size of neighboring Hanseatic towns like Stralsund. The last prince of R√ºgen, Witzlaw III, erected a court at the site of former Neue Burg in 1315. He often resided in Barth.Fr. Drescher, Der Kreis Franzburg-Barth, Kreisausschu√ü des Kreises Franzburg-Barth, Carl Klock, Barth 1932/33, edited reprint: G. Thomas, Stralsund, 1992. pp.16-24 After Witzlaw's death without an issue in 1325, his principality was inherited by Wartislaw IV of the Duchy of Pomerania, who however had to enforce his claims by two subsequent wars with Mecklenburg. During these wars, Barth was fortified with a stone and brick wall. The wars as well as contemporary and subsequent Black Death epidemics (1349, 1405 and 1451) and floods hindered Barth's growth. In 1452, Barth was besieged by Mecklenburgian troops when Wartislaw IX did not pay his debts. Hostilities between the Pomeranian dukes Eric II and Wartislaw X on one side and the Hanseatic towns of Stralsund and Greifswald, Mecklenburg and the Margraviate of Brandenburg on the other side had an additional negative impact on the town. =Protestant Reformation= In 1533, the Protestant Reformation turned Barth into a Lutheran town. In 1572, Bogislaw XIII rebuilt the ducal court in Renaissance style, and married Clare of Brunswick-L√ºneburg who was later buried in Barth. Bogislaw planned to oppose Stralsund by founding Franzburg in her hinterland, Barth was thought to function as Franzburg's port and staple place. While the plan eventually failed, Bogislaw's investments led to some slight prosperity which was only disturbed by the Black Death epidemics of 1597 and 1598. In 1627, during the Thirty Years' War, Albrecht von Wallenstein's imperial army entered Protestant Pomerania and, after they were repelled from Barth, re-took the town and exacted revenge. Before the Swedish forces entered Barth in 1630, retreating imperial troops led by Maritzen looted the town. As the war went on, some women convicted as witches were burned in the town between 1645 and 1653, three had already been burned in 1611. =Inclusion in Swedish Pomerania= After the war, Barth became part of Swedish Pomerania. In the early Swedish period, three stormfloods (1649, 1663, and 1693), a fire in 1662, and another fire in 1678 ravaged the town; the second fire was lit by Brandenburg's von Treffenfeld during the Scanian War. During the Great Northern War, the evicted Polish king Stanislaus Leszczynski was assigned Barth's old ducal court by his friend and ally, Holy Roman Emperor Karl XII, and stayed from August 1710 until March 1711. Then, Barth was conquered by Denmark. By the end of the war, when Barth became Swedish again, less than half of the town's houses were inhabited.94 of 210 \\"Erben\\" After a fire in 1722, the number of houses was reduced to 76. The town however recovered and in 1795 the number of houses had risen to 520, housing a population of 3,150. Yet, the town did not exceed its medieval limits. The fortifications surrounding the town were turned into a park in 1786. In 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, Barth was taken by French troops. A Swedish counterattack was repelled, and Barth was turned into a French garrison until the Swedish-French peace treaty. =Return to Prussia= The Swedes left Barth after Swedish Pomerania was assigned to Prussia in 1815. From then on, the town was part of the Prussian Province of Pomerania. In 1850, a cholera epidemic lasted for seven weeks. In 1872, Barth was affected by a stormflood, that retreated only after ten days. During the second half of the 19th century, the town expanded beyond its medieval limits for the first time. On 1 July 1888, Barth was connected to the Rostock-Stralsund railways, in 1902 a gas plant was built, and in 1920 electricity was introduced. =World Wars= After the First World War, the Free State of Prussia moved the Kreis headquarters from Franzburg to Barth. During World War II Barth was the site of a German prison of war camp, Stalag Luft I, for captured Allied airmen. The presence of the prison camp is said to have shielded the town from Allied bombing. Old town and harbor of Barth seen from above (2006) =GDR and recent history= Kreis Franzburg-Barth was dissolved in 1952, when it was partitioned between Kreis Ribnitz-Damgarten (with Barth) and Kreis Stralsund, both belonging to the newly created district of Rostock (Bezirk Rostock).Fr. Drescher, Der Kreis Franzburg-Barth, Kreisausschu√ü des Kreises Franzburg- Barth, Carl Klock, Barth 1932/33, edited reprint: G. Thomas, Stralsund, 1992. Vorwort. With the Fall of the Iron Curtain and German reunification, an extensive renovation of the old town centre of Barth was initiated - mainly due to the urban development promotion programme of Germany. The town harbour and surrounding areas were revitalized with residential and commercial buildings. The city is a popular destination for tourists now, especially in connection with the Fischland-Darss-Zingst peninsula and the UNESCO World Heritage city of Stralsund. In 2005, Barth celebrated 750 years of its town ordinances and privileges. Since the local government reform on September 4, 2011, Barth has belonged to the Vorpommern-R√ºgen district in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Climate Barth has a moderate climate.

With a capacity of 11,500 spectators, the venue is the home of the 1.divisjon side Lillestr√∏m SK (LSK). The stadium has four stands, of which the West Stand has luxury boxes and club seating for 700. Because of the stadium's proximity to Kjeller Airport, it has retractable floodlights. The record attendance of 13,652 dates from 2002. In addition to league, cup and UEFA Cup matches for LSK, the venue has been used for one Str√∏mmen IF top-league match in 1986, the UEFA Women's Euro 1997, eight other Norway women's national football team matches, the 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, and seven Norway national under-21 football team matches. LSK started purchasing land for their own stadium in 1947, having previously played at Lillestr√∏m Stadion. Construction started in 1950 and √Ör√•sen opened on 7 July 1951, having cost 150,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). The grandstand was supplemented with a second stand in 1960. On 7 April 1967, the stadium burned down, but was rebuilt by September 1968. Another stand opened on the east side in 1974, the same year as LSK was promoted to the 1. divisjon, then the highest division of Norwegian football. The East Stand was moved to the north side and a new 3,700-seat stand built on the east side in 1978, which remains today. Between 1999 and 2002, the other three sides were redeveloped, costing NOK 240 million. This included luxury boxes, a new pitch with under-soil heating, three grandstands, and adjacent commercial and residential property.  History  Lillestr√∏m SK originally used Jenseberg Stadion in Str√∏mmen for their matches, as there was no suitable stadium in Lillestr√∏m. On 6 June 1920, the municipality opened Lillestr√∏m Stadion, where Lillestr√∏m SK moved their matches. In 1930, the club started working on plans for their own stadium. Led by the chairman Erling Nicolaysen, a stadium fund was established, which grew to NOK 200\\\\. However, during the Second World War, the club's funds eradicated. On 2 June 1947, the club's board appointed a committee to work with the stadium issue. They determined that the area S√∏rumsbrenna, part of a farm belonging to Knut S√∏rum, was the ideal location, despite it being fallow and scrub on a marsh. Holthe og Ahlsen made plans for developing the lot. The purchase was approved by the club's annual meeting on 29 September. Additional land was bought in 1948 and 1950, raising the area to . Construction was mostly done by volunteers; the building of the stadium required 31,000 man- hours in volunteer work and cost NOK 150,000. After the land was cleared, a layer of mixed sand and earth were laid. The pitch, with the dimensions , was sown in mid-1950. The work also included a grandstand, changing rooms, a watering system and kiosks. The stand could accommodate 2,500 spectators, and the stadium had a total permitted capacity of 6,000 people. The inaugural match was played against Sarpsborg on 7 July 1951 in front of 3,500 spectators. A training pitch beside the stadium pitch opened in 1953. The following year, a new steel entrance was built, following in 1955 with a referees' changing room and administrative offices. In 1959, after eight years of planning, construction of an additional terrace started, which opened in 1960. On 7 April 1967, the grandstand caught fire and the entire structure burned down beyond repair. The buildings and stands were subsequently demolished. At the same time, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration proposed that the Fetveien road, which runs to the south of the stadium, should be moved to run through the stadium, which would have required the stadium to be moved. However, the Public Roads Administration abandoned their plans and a building permit was issued. New changing rooms, club house and terraces were completed in September 1968. The East Stand is the oldest remaining part of the stadium, having been opened in 1978 To accommodate increasing interest for the club following good results during the early 1970s, the board approved a new grandstand on the east long side. Construction started in late 1973, with the stand covering two-thirds of the length of the pitch, and opened ahead of the 1974 season with capacity for 1,056 spectators. The club house was expanded to . In 1974, the club won promotion to the First Division, and the new grandstand was extended by 352 seats. On the west side, two wooden and steel standing terraces were built. The expansion was done with help of volunteer work, with 30 to 40 people helping each weekday evening and up to 80 people helping at the weekends. The grandstand was moved to the north side and a new grandstand with seating for 3,700 people was opened on the east end in 1978. The new stand was the first in Norway to have plastic seats and is the oldest part of the current stadium. Construction cost NOK 2.8 million, which was largely loan-financed. Between 1980 and 1986, the area under the new grandstand was built to include new changing rooms, meeting rooms, offices and other facilities totaling . Some of the office space was rented out. After five years of planning, construction of a completely renovated stadium started in February 1999. To finance the stadium, a limited company, √Ör√•sen Stadion AS, was established, and owned by the club, rather than by the limited company which runs the elite team. Only the East Stand from 1978 was kept. In 2000, new grass was laid on the pitch, replacing the original grass from 1950. This included installation of under-soil heating and an automatic irrigation sprinkler system. The new pitch had the dimensions . Combined, this cost NOK 12 million. The first new stand to be completed was the West Stand, which opened ahead of the 2000 season. In addition to luxury boxes, it consists of of commercial property, including a car dealer, a medical center and a restaurant. The two-tier West Stand, with luxury boxes in the upper tier The investments at √Ör√•sen cost NOK 800 million, of which NOK 240 million was used on the stadium itself. Other investments in the area were carried out by private investors and public agencies, who bought land from Lillestr√∏m SK. The training pitch to the north was demolished to make way for student housing for 100 people. The area to the west of the stadium was turned into a car retailer. Immediately surrounding the stadium was a complex of commercial and residential properties. This included a section to the north which consists of 96 apartments, some with balconies facing the pitch, and a grocery store. Construction of the South Stand and affiliated buildings started on 15 November 2000 and was completed ahead of the 2002 season. In conjunction with the stand was a commercial area rented by Akershus County Municipality, which hosts a psychiatric clinic for children and youth. Because of the stadium's close proximity to Kjeller Airport, the stadium is limited to a height of , which meant the upgrade could not incorporate floodlights. When mounted on four posts, the flood lights need to be above ground to give 1,200 lux on the field. In 2000, this caused Lillestr√∏m SK to have to play their home match in the 2000‚Äì01 UEFA Cup against Alav√©s at Marienlyst Stadion in Drammen. In 2001, an evening league game was played using floodlighting mounted on four temporary cranes. A retractable floodlighting system was installed in January 2002. In 2006, team-owner Per Berg stated that Lillestr√∏m SK would be in need of a new venue and indicated that one could be built at Kjeller, should the airport close. By 2007, the club's management was working on ideas to building new stadium, as the luxury boxes were all sold out and the club could not make more than NOK 22 to 23 million per year on commercial income from √Ör√•sen. In 2009, Lillestr√∏m launched itself as one of six candidate cities for Norway's joint bid with Sweden to host Euro 2016. This would involve building a new venue seating between 35,000 and 44,000 in Lillestr√∏m. The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues. The proposal was selected as one of four for the bid, but the bid was never sent. In January 2009, the club sold 25 percent of their ownership in √Ör√•sen Eiendom, which is responsible for operating the commercial facilities at the stadium, to Lillestr√∏mbanken, a local bank, for NOK 9 million. The club retained full ownership of √Ör√•sen Stadion AS, the company which owns the venue. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, √Ör√•sen was found to be the league's third-best stadium, with a score of 4.33 on a scale from one to five. Facilities √Ör√•sen Stadion has a capacity of 12,250 spectators, all seated. The stadium consists of four single-tier stands. The western stand is the main stand, with the upper section consisting of luxury boxes and club seating for 700 people. For sponsorship reasons it is known as the Lillestr√∏m Torv Stand, after a local shopping center. The southern part of the East Stand houses the Kanarifansen, the official LSK supporters' group, while the northern part has unreserved seating. The South Stand is named for Romerikes Blad, the local newspaper, while the North Stand is named for Legea, a sportswear manufacturer. The latter is used for away fans. The stadium is owned by √Ör√•sen Stadion AS, which is again wholly owned by Lillestr√∏m SK. Operation of the venue's commercial properties is done by √Ör√•sen Eiendom AS, which is owned 75 percent by √Ör√•sen Stadion and 25 percent by Lillestr√∏mbanken. The stadium is within walking distance of both the town center of Lillestr√∏m and Lillestr√∏m Station. Lillestr√∏m SK hold their training sessions in the nearby Lillestr√∏m Stadion and LSK-Hallen. Events The North Stand. Also visible are the retractable flood lights. √Ör√•sen has been the home venue for Lillestr√∏m SK since the 1951 season and has been the venue for all their home league games. Since the 1975 season, LSK has played every season in the top tier of the league system. √Ör√•sen has also been the venue for most LSK matches in UEFA tournaments, including the Champions League and the UEFA Cup, but the club has previously played some home matches at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo and Marienlyst Stadion. The record attendance of 13,652 spectators was set on 16 May 2002 in the match between Lillestr√∏m and their rivals V√•lerenga. The second-highest attended match was a cup match against Rosenborg in 1993, which attracted 13,595 people. The team's highest average league attendance was set in the 2007 season, when there was an average of 9,018 spectators per match. The team's season average has been above 6,000 during the 2000s, and was as low as 6,165 in 2010 and 6,448 in 2001. The team also saw high attendances in the 1970s, attracting its fourth-ever highest average in 1977 with 8,430 spectators, and attendances of 6,531 and 6,346 in 1978 and 1976, respectively. LSK's club seats was in 2009 the most expensive tickets in the league, costing NOK 660 per match. When Str√∏mmen IF were promoted to First Division ahead of the 1986 season, the team originally announced that they would play their fall games at √Ör√•sen, as Str√∏mmen Stadion was in need of a new pitch. In the end, Str√∏mmen only played one of their matches at √Ör√•sen, drawing 1‚Äì1 against Rosenborg on 10 August 1986 in front of 1,649 spectators. Norway co-hosted UEFA Women's Euro 1997, and three group-stage matches and a semi-final were held at √Ör√•sen. This included Norway playing two matches, against Denmark and Italy, which attracted 4,221 and 4,067 spectators, respectively. Norway's national women's team has also played eight other matches at √Ör√•sen: 3‚Äì0 against Finland in 1983, 2‚Äì2 against Sweden in 1984, 1‚Äì0 against Finland in 1985, 4‚Äì0 against England in 1997, 2‚Äì0 against England in 1998, 4‚Äì0 against Ukraine in 2001, 4‚Äì1 against Ukraine in 2005 and 3‚Äì0 against Austria in 2007. Norway hosted the 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, with two group-stage matches being played at √Ör√•sen. On 23 July, Slovakia beat the Czech Republic 5‚Äì2, and on 26 July Germany beat Belgium 2‚Äì1. The former attracted 611 spectators. The Norway national under-21 football team has played seven home matches at √Ör√•sen: 1‚Äì3 against Sweden in 1979, 1‚Äì2 against France in 1987, 3‚Äì2 against San Marino in 1992, 0‚Äì0 against Georgia in 1999, 3‚Äì0 against Germany in 2001, 0‚Äì0 against Slovenia in 2004, and 1‚Äì0 against Turkey in 2007.

This is similar to the action of other biological enzymes, such as proteins or ribozymes (enzymes composed of RNA). However, in contrast to the abundance of protein enzymes in biological systems and the discovery of biological ribozymes in the 1980s, there is only little evidence for naturally occurring deoxyribozymes. Deoxyribozymes should not be confused with DNA aptamers which are oligonucleotides that selectively bind a target ligand, but do not catalyze a subsequent chemical reaction. With the exception of ribozymes, nucleic acid molecules within cells primarily serve as storage of genetic information due to its ability to form complementary base pairs, which allows for high-fidelity copying and transfer of genetic information. In contrast, nucleic acid molecules are more limited in their catalytic ability, in comparison to protein enzymes, to just three types of interactions: hydrogen bonding, pi stacking, and metal-ion coordination. This is due to the limited number of functional groups of the nucleic acid monomers: while proteins are built from up to twenty different amino acids with various functional groups, nucleic acids are built from just four chemically similar nucleobases. In addition, DNA lacks the 2'-hydroxyl group found in RNA which limits the catalytic competency of deoxyribozymes even in comparison to ribozymes. In addition to the inherent inferiority of DNA catalytic activity, the apparent lack of naturally occurring deoxyribozymes may also be due to the primarily double-stranded conformation of DNA in biological systems which would limit its physical flexibility and ability to form tertiary structures, and so would drastically limit the ability of double-stranded DNA to act as a catalyst; though there are a few known instances of biological single-stranded DNA such as multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA), certain viral genomes, and the replication fork formed during DNA replication. Further structural differences between DNA and RNA may also play a role in the lack of biological deoxyribozymes, such as the additional methyl group of the DNA base thymidine compared to the RNA base uracil or the tendency of DNA to adopt the B-form helix while RNA tends to adopt the A-form helix. However, it has also been shown that DNA can form structures that RNA cannot, which suggests that, though there are differences in structures that each can form, neither is inherently more or less catalytic due to their possible structural motifs. Types =Ribonucleases= The trans-form (two separate strands) of the 17E DNAzyme. Most ribonuclease DNAzymes have a similar form, consisting of a separate enzyme strand (blue/cyan) and substrate strand (black). Two arms of complementary bases flank the catalytic core (cyan) on the enzyme strand and the single ribonucleotide (red) on the substrate strand. The arrow shows the ribonucleotide cleavage site. The most abundant class of deoxyribozymes are ribonucleases, which catalyze the cleavage of a ribonucleotide phosphodiester bond through a transesterification reaction, forming a 2'3'-cyclic phosphate terminus and a 5'-hydroxyl terminus. Ribonuclease deoxyribozymes typically undergo selection as long, single- stranded oligonucleotides which contain a single ribonucleotide base to act as the cleavage site. Once sequenced, this single-stranded \\"cis\\"-form of the deoxyribozyme can be converted to the two-stranded \\"trans\\"-form by separating the substrate domain (containing the ribonucleotide cleavage site) and the enzyme domain (containing the catalytic core) into separate strands which can hybridize through two flanking arms consisting of complementary base pairs. The first known deoxyribozyme was a ribonuclease, discovered in 1994 by Ronald Breaker while a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Gerald Joyce at the Scripps Research Institute. This deoxyribozyme, later named GR-5, catalyzes the Pb2+-dependent cleavage of a single ribonucleotide phosphoester at a rate that is more than 100-fold compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Subsequently, additional RNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes that incorporate different metal cofactors were developed, including the Mg2+-dependent E2 deoxyribozyme and the Ca2+-dependent Mg5 deoxyribozyme. These first deoxyribozymes were unable to catalyze a full RNA substrate strand, but by incorporating the full RNA substrate strand into the selection process, deoxyribozymes which functioned with substrates consisting of either full RNA or full DNA with a single RNA base were both able to be utilized. The first of these more versatile deoxyribozymes, 8-17 and 10-23, are currently the most widely studied deoxyribozymes. In fact, many subsequently discovered deoxyribozymes were found to contain the same catalytic core motif as 8-17, including the previously discovered Mg5, suggesting that this motif represents the \\"simplest solution for the RNA cleavage problem\\". The 10-23 DNAzyme contains a 15-nucleotide catalytic core that is flanked by two substrate recognition domains. This DNAzyme cleaves complementary RNAs efficiently in a sequence specific manner between an unpaired purine and a paired pyrimidine. DNAzymes targeting AU or GU vs. GC or AC are more effective. Furthermore, the RNA cleavage rates have been shown to increase after the introduction of intercalators or the substitution of deoxyguanine with deoxyinosine at the junction of the catalytic loop. Specifically, the addition of 2‚Äô-O-methyl modifications to the catalytic proved to significantly increase the cleavage rate both in vitro and in vivo. Other notable deoxyribozyme ribonucleases are those that are highly selective for a certain cofactor. Among this group are the metal selective deoxyribozymes such as Pb2+-specific 17E, UO22+-specific 39E, and Na+-specific A43. First crystal structure of a DNAzyme was reported in 2016. 10-23 core based DNAzymes and the respective MNAzymes that catalyse reactions at ambient temperatures were described in 2018 and open doors for use of these nucleic acid based enzymes for many other applications without the need for heating. This link and this link describe the DNA molecule 5'-GGAGAACGCGAGGCAAGGCTGGGAGAAATGTGGATCACGATT-3' , which acts as a deoxyribozyme that uses light to repair a thymine dimer, using serotonin as cofactor. =RNA ligases= Of particular interest are DNA ligases. These molecules have demonstrated remarkable chemoselectivity in RNA branching reactions. Although each repeating unit in a RNA strand owns a free hydroxyl group, the DNA ligase takes just one of them as a branching starting point. This cannot be done with traditional organic chemistry. =Other reactions= Many other deoxyribozymes have since been developed that catalyze DNA phosphorylation, DNA adenylation, DNA deglycosylation, porphyrin metalation, thymine dimer photoreversion and DNA cleavage. Methods =in vitro selection= Because there are no known naturally occurring deoxyribozymes, most known deoxyribozyme sequences have been discovered through a high- throughput in vitro selection technique, similar to SELEX. in vitro selection utilizes a \\"pool\\" of a large number of random DNA sequences (typically 1014‚Äì1015 unique strands) that can be screened for a specific catalytic activity. The pool is synthesized through solid phase synthesis such that each strand has two constant regions (primer binding sites for PCR amplification) flanking a random region of a certain length, typically 25‚Äì50 bases long. Thus the total number of unique strands, called the sequence space, is 4N where N denotes the number of bases in the random region. Because 425 ‚âà 1015, there is no practical reason to choose random regions of less than 25 bases in length, while going above this number of bases means that the total sequence space cannot be surveyed. However, since there are likely many potential candidates for a given catalytic reaction within the sequence space, random regions of 50 and even higher have successfully yielded catalytic deoxyribozymes. The pool is first subjected to a selection step, during which the catalytic strands are separated from the non-catalytic strands. The exact separation method will depend on the reaction being catalyzed. As an example, the separation step for ribonucleotide cleavage often utilizes affinity chromatography, in which a biological tag attached to each DNA strand is removed from any catalytically active strands via cleavage of a ribonucleotide base. This allows the catalytic strands to be separated by a column that specifically binds the tag, since the non-active strands will remain bound to the column while the active strands (which no longer possess the tag) flow through. A common set-up for this is a biotin tag with a streptavidin affinity column. Gel electrophoresis based separation can also be used in which the change in molecular weight of strands upon the cleavage reaction is enough to cause a shift in the location of the reactive strands on the gel. After the selection step, the reactive pool is amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to regenerate and amplify the reactive strands, and the process is repeated until a pool of sufficient reactivity is obtained. Multiple rounds of selection are required because some non-catalytic strands will inevitably make it through any single selection step. Usually 4‚Äì10 rounds are required for unambiguous catalytic activity, though more rounds are often necessary for more stringent catalytic conditions. After a sufficient number of rounds, the final pool is sequenced and the individual strands are tested for their catalytic activity. The dynamics of the pool can be described through mathematical modeling , which shows how oligonucleotides undergo competitive binding with the targets and how the evolutionary outcome can be improved through fine tuning of parameters. Deoxyribozymes obtained through in vitro selection will be optimized for the conditions during the selection, such as salt concentration, pH, and the presence of cofactors. Because of this, catalytic activity only in the presence of specific cofactors or other conditions can be achieved using positive selection steps, as well as negative selection steps against other undesired conditions. =in vitro evolution= A similar method of obtaining new deoxyribozymes is through in vitro evolution. Though this term is often used interchangeably with in vitro selection, in vitro evolution more appropriately refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is genetically altered over subsequent rounds through genetic recombination or through point mutations. For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using error-prone PCR to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with in vitro selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, and once a sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands. The initial pool for in vitro evolution can be derived from a narrowed subset of sequence space, such as a certain round of an in vitro selection experiment, which is sometimes also called in vitro reselection. The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through in vitro evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the mRNA transcript of bovine serum albumin was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through deep sequencing analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation. This first successful evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could provide support for the RNA World hypothesis. In another recent study, an RNA ligase ribozyme was converted into a deoxyribozyme through in vitro evolution of the inactive deoxyribo-analog of the ribozyme. The new RNA ligase deoxyribozyme contained just twelve point mutations, two of which had no effect on activity, and had a catalytic efficiency of approximately 1/10 of the original ribozyme, though the researches hypothesized that the activity could be further increased through further selection. This first evidence for transfer of function between different nucleic acids could provide support for various pre-RNA World hypotheses. \\"True\\" catalysis? Because most deoxyribozymes suffer from product inhibition and thus exhibit single-turnover behavior, it is sometimes argued that deoxyribozymes do not exhibit \\"true\\" catalytic behavior since they cannot undergo multiple-turnover catalysis like most biological enzymes. However, the general definition of a catalyst requires only that the substance speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed by the reaction (i.e. it is not permanently chemically altered and can be recycled). Thus, by this definition, single-turnover deoxyribozymes are indeed catalysts. Furthermore, many endogenous enzymes (both proteins and ribozymes) also exhibit single-turnover behavior, and so the exclusion of deoxyribozymes from the rank of \\"catalyst\\" simply because it does not feature multiple-turnover behavior seems unjustified. Applications Although RNA enzymes were discovered before DNA enzymes, the latter have some distinct advantages. DNA is more cost-effective, and DNA can be made with longer sequence length and can be made with higher purity in solid-phase synthesis. Several studies have shown the usage of DNAzymes to inhibit influenza A and B virus replication in host cells. DNAzymes have also been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus 14 and HCV =Drug clinical trials= Asthma is characterized by eosinophil- induced inflammation motivated by a type 2 helper T cell (Th2). By targeting the transcription factor, GATA3, of the Th2 pathway, with DNAzyme it may be possible to negate the inflammation. The safety and efficacy of SB010, a novel 10-23 DNAzyme was evaluated, and found to have the ability to cleave and inactivate GATA3 messenger RNA in phase IIa clinical trials. Treatment with SB010 significantly offset both late and early asthmatic responses after allergen aggravation in male patients with allergic asthma. The transcription factor GATA-3 is also an interesting target, of the DNAzyme topical formulation SB012, for a novel therapeutic strategy in ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases defined by chronically relapsing inflammations of the gastrointestinal tract, and characterized by a superficial, continuous mucosal inflammation, which predominantly affects the large intestine. Patients that do not effectively respond to current UC treatment strategies exhibit serious drawbacks one of which may lead to colorectal surgery, and can result in a severely compromised quality of life. Thus, patients with moderate or severe UC may significantly benefit from these new therapeutic alternatives, of which SB012 is in phase I clinical trials. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, in which patients suffer from eczema, often severe pruritus on the affected skin, as well as complications and secondary infections. AD surfaces from an upregulation of Th2-modified immune responses, therefore a novel AD approach using DNAzymes targeting GATA-3 is a plausible treatment option. The topical DNAzyme SB011 is currently in phase II clinical trials. DNAzyme research for the treatment of cancer is also underway. The development of a 10-23 DNAzyme that can block the expression of IGF-I (Insulin-like growth factor I, a contributor to normal cell growth as well as tumorigenesis) by targeting its mRNA could be useful for blocking the secretion of IGF-I from prostate storm primary cells ultimately inhibiting prostate tumor development. Additionally, with this treatment it is expected that hepatic metastasis would also be inhibited, via the inhibition of IGF-I in the liver (the major source of serum IGF-I). =Sensors= DNAzymes have found practical use in metal biosensors. A DNAzyme based biosensor for lead ion was used to detect lead ion in water in St. Paul Public Schools in Minnesota. =Asymmetric synthesis= Chirality is another property that a DNAzyme can exploit. DNA occurs in nature as a right- handed double helix and in asymmetric synthesis a chiral catalyst is a valuable tool in the synthesis of chiral molecules from an achiral source. In one application an artificial DNA catalyst was prepared by attaching a copper ion to it through a spacer. The copper - DNA complex catalysed a Diels-Alder reaction in water between cyclopentadiene and an aza chalcone. The reaction products (endo and exo) were found to be present in an enantiomeric excess of 50%. Later it was found that an enantiomeric excess of 99% could be induced, and that both the rate and the enantioselectivity were related to the DNA sequence. =Other uses= Other uses of DNA in chemistry are in DNA-templated synthesis, Enantioselective catalysis, DNA nanowires and DNA computing.

Born the son of John Murphy and Gertrude Wadden in St. John's, Newfoundland, he was educated at Saint Bonaventure's College. He worked for a time as a radio announcer with VOCM, but, following his 1951 marriage to Marjorie Halley, joined Halley and Company, a dry goods wholesale and retail firm. Following the death of his father-in-law, Patrick Halley, in 1956, Murphy became president of the company and expanded its retail chain, The Arcade, to nine stores in the St. John's and Conception Bay South region. As of 1990, only two of the stores were still operating. Murphy ran unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in the 1966 provincial election and again in a by-election in 1970. Elected to St. John's City council in 1973, he became deputy mayor. In 1977, he ran unsuccessfully against incumbent mayor Dorothy Wyatt, but defeated her in 1981. He won by acclamation in 1985, did not run in the 1990 election, but was elected for again in 1993, and retired from city politics in 1997 after losing his bid for re-election as Mayor. During his tenure on council Murphy was successful in restoring downtown residential properties by lobbying federal and provincial governments for home improvement funds. The city also began a housing program which won several national awards. In 1990 Murphy tried to convince the provincial government to expand the city's boundaries to include Mount Pearl, Paradise, Conception Bay South and Wedgewood Park. On June 24, 1985, Murphy was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada and in May 2005, Murphy received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa from the Memorial University of Newfoundland.

Even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were divided over the use of the weapon. The only time nuclear weapons have been used in warfare was during the final stages of World War II when United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bombers dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945. The role of the bombings in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades. Nuclear disarmament refers both to the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world. Proponents of disarmament typically condemn a priori the threat or use of nuclear weapons as immoral and argue that only total disarmament can eliminate the possibility of nuclear war. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine deterrence and make conventional wars more likely, more destructive, or both. The debate becomes considerably complex when considering various scenarios for example, total vs partial or unilateral vs multilateral disarmament. History The Fat Man mushroom cloud resulting from the nuclear explosion over Nagasaki. = Manhattan Project = Because the Manhattan Project was considered to be \\"top secret,\\" there was no public discussion of the use of nuclear arms, and even within the US government, knowledge of the bomb was extremely limited. However, even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were divided over the use of the weapon.  Franck Report  On June 2nd 1945, Arthur Compton, the leader of the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, also known as Met Lab, at the University of Chicago briefed his staff on the latest information from the Interim Committee, which was formulating plans for the use of the atomic bomb to force Japanese capitulation. In response to the briefing, Met Lab's Committee on the Social and Political Implications of the Atomic Bomb, chaired by James Franck, wrote the Franck Report. The report, to which Leo Szil√°rd and Glenn T. Seaborg also contributed, argued that instead of being used against a city, the first atomic bomb should be \\"demonstrated\\" to the Japanese on an uninhabited area. The recommendation was not agreed with by the military commanders, the Los Alamos Target Committee (made up of other scientists), or the politicians who had input into the use of the weapon. The report also argued that to preclude a nuclear arms race and a destabilized world order, the existence of the weapon should be made public so that a collaborative, international body could come to control atomic power: > \\"From this point of view a demonstration of the new weapon may best be made > before the eyes of representatives of all United Nations, on the desert or a > barren island. The best possible atmosphere for the achievement of an > international agreement could be achieved if America would be able to say to > the world, ‚ÄúYou see what weapon we had but did not use. We are ready to > renounce its use in the future and to join other nations in working out > adequate supervision of the use of this nuclear weapon.‚Äù \\\\- The Franck > Report  Szil√°rd Petition  70 scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, many of them from Met Lab, represented in part by Le√≥ Szil√°rd, put forth a petition to President Harry Truman in July 1945. The Szil√°rd Petition urged Truman to use the atomic bomb only if the full terms of surrender were made public and if Japan, in full possession of the facts, still refused to surrender. > \\"We, the undersigned, respectfully petition: first, that you exercise your > power as Commander-in-Chief, to rule that the United States shall not resort > to the use of atomic bombs in this war unless the terms which will be > imposed upon Japan have been made public in detail and Japan knowing these > terms has refused to surrender; second, that in such an event the question > whether or not to use atomic bombs be decided by you in the light of the > considerations presented in this petition as well as all the other moral > responsibilities which are involved.\\" \\\\- The Szil√°rd Petition The petition also warned Truman to consider the future implications of the decision to use the atomic bomb, including the probability of a rapid nuclear arms race and a decline in global security, and pleaded with him to prevent such an eventuality if possible. = Hiroshima and Nagasaki = The Little Boy atomic bomb was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500 tonnes of TNT, the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division) and killed approximately 75,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese soldiers and 20,000 Koreans. Detonation of the \\"Fat Man\\" atomic bomb exploded over the Japanese city of Nagasaki three days later on 9 August 1945, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200-28,200 Japanese civilian munitions workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. The role of the bombings in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades. J. Samuel Walker suggests that \\"the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue\\". = Postwar = After the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world‚Äôs nuclear weapons stockpiles grew,Mary Palevsky, Robert Futrell, and Andrew Kirk. Recollections of Nevada's Nuclear Past UNLV FUSION, 2005, p. 20. and nuclear weapons have been detonated on over two thousand occasions for testing and demonstration purposes. Countries known to have detonated nuclear weapons and that acknowledge possessing such weapons are (chronologically) the United States, the Soviet Union (succeeded as a nuclear power by Russia), the United Kingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. In the early 1980s, a revival of the nuclear arms race caused a popular nuclear disarmament movement to emerge. In October 1981 500,000 people took to the streets in several cities in Italy, more than 250,000 people protested in Bonn, 250,000 demonstrated in London, and 100,000 marched in Brussels.David Cortright (2008). Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas, Cambridge University Press, p. 147. The largest anti-nuclear protest was held on June 12, 1982, when one million people demonstrated in New York City against nuclear weapons.Jonathan Schell. The Spirit of June 12 The Nation, July 2, 2007.David Cortright (2008). Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas, Cambridge University Press, p. 145.1982 - a million people march in New York City In October 1983, nearly 3 million people across western Europe protested nuclear missile deployments and demanded an end to the arms race.David Cortright (2008). Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas, Cambridge University Press, p. 148. Arguments Under the scenario of total multilateral disarmament, there is no possibility of nuclear war. Under scenarios of partial disarmament, there is a disagreement as to how the probability of nuclear war would change. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine the ability of governments to threaten sufficient retaliation upon an attack to deter aggression against them. Application of game theory to questions of strategic nuclear warfare during the Cold War resulted in the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD), a concept developed by Robert McNamara and others in the mid-1960s.Elliot, Jeffrey M. and Robert Reginald. (1989). The Arms Control, Disarmament, and Military Security Dictionary, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, Inc. Its success in averting nuclear war was theorized to depend upon the \\"readiness at any time before, during, or after an attack to destroy the adversary as a functioning society.\\"Gertcher, Frank L., and William J. Weida. (1990). Beyond Deterrence, Boulder: Westview Press, Inc. Those who believe governments that should develop or maintain nuclear-strike capability usually justify their position with reference to the Cold War, claiming that a \\"nuclear peace\\" was the result of both the US and the USSR possessing mutual second-strike retaliation capability. Since the end of the Cold War, theories of deterrence in international relations have been further developed and generalized in the concept of the stability‚Äìinstability paradox Proponents of disarmament call into question the assumption that political leaders are rational actors who place the protection of their citizens above other considerations, and highlight, as McNamara himself later acknowledged with the benefit of hindsight, the non-rational choices, chance, and contingency, which played a significant role in averting nuclear war, such as during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and the Able Archer 83 crisis of 1983.James G Blight, Janet M. Lang. The Fog of War: Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara, page 60. Thus, they argue that evidence trumps theory and deterrence theories cannot be reconciled with the historical record. Kenneth Waltz argues in favor of the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons. In the July 2012 issue of Foreign Affairs Waltz took issue with the view of most US, European, and Israeli commentators and policymakers that a nuclear-armed Iran would be unacceptable. Instead, Waltz argues that it would probably be the best possible outcome by restoring stability to the Middle East since it would balance the Israeli regional monopoly on nuclear weapons. Professor John Mueller of Ohio State University, author of Atomic Obsession has also dismissed the need to interfere with Iran's nuclear program and expressed that arms control measures are counterproductive.Bloggingheads.tv from 19:00 to 26:00 minutes During a 2010 lecture at the University of Missouri, which was broadcast by C-Span, Dr. Mueller also argued that the threat from nuclear weapons, including that from terrorists, has been exaggerated in the popular media and by officials. In contrast, various American government officials, including Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and William Perry, who were in office during the Cold War period, now advocate the elimination of nuclear weapons in the belief that the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence is obsolete and that reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence is increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective ever since the Cold War ended.George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn. A World Free of Nuclear Weapons Wall Street Journal, January 4, 2007, page A15. A 2011 article in The Economist argued, along similar lines, that risks are more acute in rivalries between relatively-new nuclear states that lack the \\"security safeguards\\" developed by the Americans and the Soviets and that additional risks are posed by the emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons as well as the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy, or build a nuclear device.

The show ran on CBS from March 11, 1987 to June 7, 1988 and had 31 episodes. Summary The core of the series is the partnership between two very different cops from two different cultures. Chicago cop Joey LaFiamma, played by Michael Par√©, is transferred to Houston after he kills a mobster from a powerful Mafia family and a contract is put out on him. Once there, he is partnered with Levon Lundy, played by Michael Beck, the grandson of a Texas Ranger. Although as different as night and day, and after a rocky beginning (the two engage in a fist-fight) they form a successful partnership and become friends. This is aided to a certain extent by an event where a hitman from Chicago who holds the contract to shoot La Fiamma arrives in Houston and is ultimately killed by Lundy. During the series, it is revealed that both La Fiamma and Lundy have their own personal demons. La Fiamma's Chicago partner had been killed when the partner went into a crime scene while La Fiamma had waited for backup to arrive. Lundy's wife had been killed by an explosion that was intended to kill him. Background Producer Jay Bernstein said the show \\"goes against the grain of current television thinking. It's an hour-long episode show at a time when half-hour comedy is king. It features two male police officers when family situation stories are hot.\\" Bernstein said the leads needed to say what America should be... Houston Knights was created on a formula that started with Columbia Pictures. They had these two-reelers during the 1930s using two leading men who always fought with each other. There was the same relationship between John Wayne and Randolph Scott in the 1940s in movies like 'Pittsburgh.' This is different for television, but has been used in the movies since the 1930s. These are principled men. They're in the 1980s but with the conservative morals of the 1940s.\\"A PRODUCER WHO TRUSTS HIS INSTINCTS: [THIRD Edition] De Atley, Richard. Boston Globe 8 July 1986: 28. The show was renewed for a second season. Beck said his relationship on air with Pare would be \\"less abrasive... We used that as a starting-off point, but everyone now feels that coming into living rooms that way, week after week, might grow a little tiring for the viewer. We'll have more of a needling instead of an 'I-hate-your-guts' feel between them. There'll still be a rivalry and animosity there, but not quite so hard-edged.\\"HOUSTON KNIGHTS' PATROL EARLIER BEAT: [3 STAR Edition] Jay Bobbin , Tribune Tv Log. Orlando Sentinel 28 July 1987: E6. Music The theme music for the series was Texan blues-rock style, opening with a steamy saxophone then featuring slide guitar work and a heavy bass line. Dennis McCarthy and George Doering composed the music for the series. Lee Ritenour is also credited as a major contributor to the music featured in the series. Features One of the key features of the show was the car driven by La Fiamma, an ice-blue 289 AC Cobra \\"replicar\\", credited as being provided by \\"North American Fibreglass\\". The car was yet another way to demonstrate that La Fiamma didn't \\"fit\\" in Texas, as most other characters on the show drove pickup trucks (including Lundy). The wardrobe for La Fiamma consisted of well-cut and stylish Italian label clothing, another contrast to Lundy, who was always attired in typical Texas \\"cowboy\\" clothes. Reception The New York Times said the pilot \\"s so confused and confusing that it is impossible to tell whether this latest police-detective romp can pull itself together long enough to have a shot at surviving.\\"'HOUSTON KNIGHTS,' A SERIES ON CBS: [Review] O'Connor, John J.

Kennedy International Airport) to Los Angeles International Airport. On March 1, 1962, the Boeing 707 rolled over and crashed into Jamaica Bay two minutes after takeoff, killing all 87 passengers and eight crew members aboard. A Civil Aeronautics Board investigation determined that a manufacturing defect in the autopilot system led to an uncommanded rudder control system input, causing the accident. A number of notable people died in the crash. It was the fifth fatal Boeing 707 accident, and at the time, the deadliest.  Flight and crash  The aircraft was a Boeing 707-123B, registered as N7506A. It was delivered to American Airlines on February 12, 1959. At the time of the crash, it had accumulated 8,147 flight hours. Its last periodic inspection had occurred on January 18, 1962, at 7,922 hours of air time. The flight crew consisted of Captain James Heist (56), First Officer Michael Barna Jr. (35), Second Officer Robert Pecor (32), and Flight Engineer Robert Cain (32). (Navigate: Historical Aircraft Accident Reports (1934-1965)‚Üí 1962‚Üí American Airlines) The aircraft received instructions to taxi to Runway 31L at 9:54 am EST, and clearance to proceed to Los Angeles nonstop under instrument flight rules (IFR) at 10:02 am. Flight 1 became airborne at 10:07 am. Following American Airlines procedures and departure control instructions, the aircraft initiated a left turn to a heading of 290¬∞. In the course of the turn, at 1,600 feet, the aircraft banked too sharply, flipped past 90¬∞, and began an upside-down, nose-first descent in a nearly vertical dive. Flight 1 crashed into Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78¬∞ and on a magnetic heading of 300¬∞. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a tall splash of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions that shook the foundations of nearby houses, though no one on the ground is known to have witnessed the airliner hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York/Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive column of water rising above the hangars, and one guard‚Äîat his post on the Cross Bay Bridge‚Äîsaw the aircraft roll over. (plaintext) (plaintext) The aircraft crashed into a remote area of marshland on Jamaica Bay used as a wildlife sanctuary. Upwards of 300 policemen and fire fighters, including 125 detectives attending a narcotics seminar at the police academy, as well as Coast Guard helicopters, were mobilized to the crash site within half an hour of the crash for rescue operations, only to find no survivors. The three-alarm fire was under control by 10:50 am, when only wreckage remained. Low tides aided search personnel in their attempts to recover bodies from the downed aircraft. Only a few bodies remained intact. Federal investigation The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) received notification of the accident at 10:10 am and immediately sent investigators to Jamaica Bay to conduct an investigation. The flight recorder was found on March 9 and sent to Washington, DC, for analysis. (plaintext) Public hearings were held at the International Hotel in New York on March 20‚Äì23, 1962. Investigators were unable to recover sufficient body tissue to determine whether the crew had been physically incapacitated at the time of the crash. Toxicology reports conclusively ruled out toxic gases, alcohol, and drugs as possible cause for the crash. Milton Helpern, Chief Medical Examiner, decided that having relatives attempt visual identification of the crash victims was inhumane and ordered dental and fingerprint comparisons. In early July, the CAB announced their investigators believed that a cotter pin and a bolt missing from the rudder mechanism might have caused Flight 1's crash. Though considered to be a \\"mechanic's oversight\\", the CAB nevertheless wired all 707 operators to inform them of the potential danger of the assembly. (plaintext) In January 1963, the CAB released its aircraft accident report stating that the \\"most likely abnormality\\" to have caused the crash was a short circuit caused by wires in the automatic piloting system that had been damaged in the manufacturing process. It stated that the probable cause of the accident was \\"...rudder control system malfunction producing yaw, sideslip, and roll leading to a loss of control from which recovery was not effective\\" and concluded \\"that a rudder servo malfunction due to shorted wires is the most likely abnormality to have produced the accident.\\" CAB inspectors had inspected units at a Bendix Corporation plant in Teterboro, New Jersey, and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires, thereby damaging them. (plaintext) The Bendix Corporation issued denials, stating that the units underwent 61 inspections during manufacturing, in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work, and insisted that had the insulation on the wires been breached at some point, it would have surely been detected and the unit replaced. (plaintext) Somewhat unusually, American Airlines continued using the \\"Flight 1\\" designator after the accident; AA1 is still used for a daily morning departure from New York-JFK to Los Angeles using the Airbus A321T.  Notable victims  A number of well-known persons were aboard Flight 1 when it went down in Jamaica Bay. (plaintext) They included: * Admiral Richard Lansing Conolly, USN (retired), president of Long Island University and two-time Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, along with his wife * George T. Felbeck, retired president of Union Carbide and former operations manager of Oak Ridge, Tennessee's uranium enrichment plant, died the day after he retired. * W. Alton Jones, multimillionaire, former president and chairman of Cities Service Company and close personal friend of Dwight D. Eisenhower: Jones was found to be carrying $55,690 in cash, including a $10,000 bill. * Arnold Kirkeby, millionaire realtor and former head of the Kirkeby chain of luxury hotels * Emelyn Whiton, 1952 Olympic sailing gold medalist (6-m keelboat).  In popular culture The crash serves as a central plot element in the Mad Men season-two episode \\"Flight 1\\" (episode two). Pete Campbell's father Andrew is one of the passengers killed (in real life, this served as a way to write off Pete's father after his actor Christopher Allport was killed in an avalanche in January 2008). Later in the episode, accounts man Herman \\"Duck\\" Phillips is so determined to sign American as an account and so convinced of Pete's ambition, that he recruits Pete specifically to woo American, while insisting the firm cut all ties with competitor Mohawk. The ploy costs the firm all its airline business, as they drop Mohawk only to be spurned by American.Maynard, Micheline. \\"Reliving a 1962 Crash on ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô.\\" The New York Times.

History A Boeing 737-200 in MetroJet colors A MetroJet Boeing 737-200 After the conclusion of painstaking labor negotiations in 1997, US Airways sought to head off burgeoning competition from low-cost carriers in its strongest region, the U.S. Northeast. Competitor Southwest Airlines was encroaching from its base in the west as were Delta Express and AirTran Airways from the South. Like them it would offer a single class of service, operate a single type of aircraft, which consisted of the Boeing 737-200, and fly a limited network, based at the airline's Baltimore hub. Like similar projects from traditional carriers, including Continental Lite, Delta Express, and Shuttle by United, it would participate in the parent airline's frequent flyer program and other systems. MetroJet was launched on June 1, 1998, flying from its base at Baltimore-Washington International Airport to Cleveland, Ohio, Providence, Rhode Island, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Manchester, New Hampshire. It began with five dedicated aircraft, repainted in a distinctive livery with a red and gray fuselage, and the traditional blue tail with the US Airways logo. It was slated for a measured expansion over the next two years that eventually included flights from Washington Dulles International Airport and several point-to-point operations, with an emphasis on connecting Northeastern passengers to destinations in Florida. MetroJet provided great customer service and low fares. They participated in US Airways‚Äô loyalty program, Dividend Miles, and held many of the same policies. The airline offered one single class rather than multiple, however, their seats had 33 inches of pitch. They allowed two carry on bags as long as they could fit under the seat. Their 737s could carry about 120 passengers. In the summer of 1999, US Airways‚Äô service began to deteriorate, in part because too much attention was being devoted to MetroJet. It was becoming difficult for US Airways to manage both MetroJet and their own struggling company. Even though MetroJet continued to fly high, the future seemed uncertain for both companies. MetroJet operations did not improve US Airways's loss-making record. Many of MetroJet's passengers were cannibalized from other US Airways operations, such as its major presence at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Its aircraft were among the oldest and least fuel efficient in US Airways's fleet, and like its parent its labor costs were among the highest in the industry. Meanwhile, it faced cutthroat competition with Southwest, its main competitor at BWI. In an October 28, 2001 interview with Business Travel News, CEO David Siegel revealed that MetroJet's average cost per available seat mile was 8 cents, compared to 6 cents for Southwest and 10 cents for mainline US Airways. The September 11, 2001 attacks gave US Airways a rationale to invoke a force majeure clause in its labor contracts to close the operation, announced on September 24. The airline also largely ended its Baltimore hub, which it had inherited from an earlier merger with Piedmont Airlines. Once the largest carrier there, its number of scheduled flights had fallen by 60 percent by the time the last MetroJet 737 was retired in December.

The school is named in honor of the American poet, Walt Whitman. The school serves grades 9-12 for the Montgomery County Public Schools. History The school opened in the fall of 1962 with 1,418 students. Designed by local architectural firm McLeod, Ferrara & Ensign, it was built on 17 levels, with a center courtyard and a geodesic dome for its gymnasium. A Ford Foundation grant underwrote the design and construction of the dome. In 1981, a 1,176-seat auditorium was added to the school. In 1992, the geodesic dome and all other buildings except for the auditorium were demolished and construction began on a new school building, which opened in fall 1993. Academics In 2019, Whitman was the top ranked high school in Maryland and #93 nationwide by the US News and World Report. Athletics Whitman fields sports teams in fall, winter, and spring seasons. The school competes as the Vikings and it is part of Montgomery County public school sports. The football field is named after long time principal Jerome Marco. The school has won 11 soccer state championships, including two back to back in 2018-2019. . The girl's basketball team won the state title in 2016, which is their second overall. The boy's team went on a miracle run in 2006 and defeated Eleanor Roosevelt 39-38 to capture the school's only state title. That season, Whitman leading scorer Michael Gruner was named co-gazette player of the year alongside NBA superstar Kevin Durant.

The protocol itself was designed in such a manner as to maximize packet efficiency over Ethernet by bundling multiple characters from multiple ports into a single packet for Ethernet transport. Over time, other host implementations of the LAT protocol appeared allowing communications to a wide range of Unix and other non-Digital operating systems using the LAT protocol. History In 1984, the first implementation of the LAT protocol connected a terminal server to a VMS VAX- Cluster in Spit Brook Road, Nashua, NH. By \\"virtualizing\\" the terminal port at the host end, a very large number of plug-and-play VT100-class terminals could connect to each host computer system. Additionally, a single physical terminal could connect via multiple sessions to multiple hosts simultaneously. Future generations of terminal servers included both LAT and TELNET protocols, one of the earliest protocols created to run on a burgeoning TCP/IP based Internet. Additionally, the ability to create reverse direction pathways from users to non-traditional RS232 devices (i.e. UNIX Host TTYS1 operator ports) created an entirely new market for Terminal Servers, now known as console servers in the mid to late 1990s, year 2000 and beyond through today. LAT and VMS drove the initial surge of adoption of \\"thick-wire\\" Ethernet by the computer industry. By 1986, terminal server networks accounted for 10% of Digital's $10 billion revenue. These early Ethernet LANs scaled using Ethernet bridges (another DEC invention) as well as DECnet routers. Subsequently, Cisco routers, which implemented TCP-IP and DECnet, emerged as a global connection between these packet-based Ethernet LANs. Over time, when terminals became less popular, terminal emulators had a built-in LAT client.

Launch  Animation of PAS-22 trajectory around Earth from 24 December 1997 to 30 June 1998 AsiaSat 3 was launched by AsiaSat Ltd of Hong Kong to provide communications and television services in Asia by a Proton booster on 24 December 1997, destined for an orbit slot at 105.5¬∞ E. However, a failure of the Blok DM3 fourth stage left it stranded in a highly inclined (51¬∞) and elliptical orbit, although still fully functional. It was declared a total loss by its insurers. The satellite was transferred to Hughes Global Services, Inc., which was then a subsidiary of Hughes Space and Communications Company, with an agreement to share any profits with the insurers. Edward Belbruno and Rex Ridenoure heard about the problem and proposed a 3‚Äì5 month low-energy transfer trajectory that would swing past the Moon and leave the satellite in geostationary orbit around the Earth. Hughes had no ability to track the satellite at such a distance and considered this trajectory concept unworkable. Instead, Hughes used an Apollo-style free-return trajectory that required only a few days to complete, a trajectory designed and subsequently patentedSalvatore, Jeremiah O., and Ocampo Cesar A. (Assignee: Hughes Electronics Corporation) U.S. Patent 6,116,545, \\"Free return lunar flyby transfer method for geosynchronous satellites\\", Filed April 9, 1998.Salvatore, Jeremiah O. and Ocampo, Cesar A. (Assignee: Hughes Electronics Corporation) U.S. Patent 6,149,103, \\"Free return lunar flyby transfer method for geosynchronous satellites having multiple perilune stages\\", filed May 15, 1998. by Hughes Chief Technologist Jerry Salvatore.J. Fisher, \\"AsiaSat Rescue: The Real Story, Part 1\\", Hughes, July 8, 2013 (accessed 10 December 2014). This maneuver removed only 40¬∞ of orbital inclination and left the satellite in a geosynchronous orbit, whereas the Belbruno maneuver would have removed all 51¬∞ of inclination and left it in geostationary orbit. Although Hughes did not end up using the low-energy transfer trajectory, the insight to use a lunar swingby was key to the spacecraft rescue. According to Cesar Ocampo, Hughes had not considered this option until it was contacted by Ridenoure, although the Hughes engineers involved in the lunar flyby operations have stated that they were already working on the lunar swingby mission design before being contacted by him.  Rescue of satellite  Using on-board propellant and lunar gravity, the orbit's apogee was gradually increased with several manoeuvres at perigee until it flew by the Moon at a distance of 6,200 km from its surface in May 1998, becoming in a sense the first commercial lunar spacecraft. Another lunar fly-by was performed later that month at a distance of 34,300 km to further improve the orbital inclination. These operations consumed most of the satellite's propellant, but still much less than it would take to remove the inclination without the Moon-assist manoeuvres. With the remaining fuel, the satellite could be controlled as a geosynchronous satellite, with half the life of a normal satellite ‚Äì a huge gain, considering that it had been declared a total loss. The satellite was then maneuvered to geosynchronous orbit at 150‚Äì154¬∞ W. Once the satellite was in a stable orbit, it was commanded to release its solar panels, which had been stowed during takeoff and maneuvering. Of the satellite's two solar panels, only one released, and it became apparent that a tether was not operating correctly onboard, which engineers attributed to heating and cooling cycles due to the satellite operating outside its design range while traveling to its final orbit. In 1999, HGS-1 was acquired by PanAmSat, renamed to PAS 22, and moved to 60¬∞ W. It was deactivated in July 2002 and moved to a graveyard orbit.

United Kingdom and Ireland Foley's off-licence, Sligo, Ireland In the United Kingdom and Ireland the corresponding term is off- licence, which refers to the fact that alcohol may be bought on the licensed premises, but must be consumed off the premises. Almost all supermarkets and groceries, and many petrol stations, have an off-licence. In the United Kingdom, the \\"off-licence\\" status of a shop could once be used as a device to circumvent restrictive trading laws, particularly those concerning Sunday trading. Depending on local by-laws, shops might be either required to close at 12:00 once a week, or else not be allowed to trade in the evening. Shops with an off-licence made their hours similar to those of public houses, opening during lunch hours and from early evening to the mandatory closing time, usually 22:30 or 23:00. The Sunday Trading Act 1994, however, somewhat altered this situation.

The consumption of alcohol on premises is not forbidden, but is frowned upon. In the Netherlands supermarkets are allowed to sell alcoholic beverages up to 15% ABV, hard liquor is only sold from specialized bottle shops. United States Some states in the United States operate their own retail stores for the sale of certain types of alcohol, such as this state-run liquor store in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. The Bunghole, a liquor store in Salem, Massachusetts, a non-ABC state The Twenty-first Amendment of the United States Constitution allows states to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages.U.S. Constitution, Amendment XXI, Section 2. State regulations vary widely. The majority of the U.S. states have laws specifying which alcoholic beverages must be sold in specialty liquor stores and which may be sold in other venues. In seventeen alcoholic beverage control (ABC) states, the specialty liquor stores are owned and operated exclusively by the state government, where liquor stores often sell only spirits or sometimes sell spirits and wine but not beer. ABC-run stores may be called ABC stores or state stores. In Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Texas, liquor stores are also known as package stores; locally in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and areas bordering these states the term pack or packie is used as well, because purchased liquor must be packaged in sealed bottles or other containers when it is taken from the store.E.g., Connecticut General Statutes, Chap. 545, Section 30-20. In four states (Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, and Utah), only low-point beer may be sold in supermarkets or gas stations. In Utah, stores not owned and operated by the state are known as Package Agencies. These are liquor outlets operated by private individuals or corporate entities under contract with the state for the purpose of selling packaged liquor, wine and beer to the general public for off-premise consumption. Package Agencies are located in communities too small to warrant the establishment of a state store, and in resorts and hotels where the outlets exist primarily for the benefit of their guests. In Minnesota there are both private liquor stores or city-owned municipal liquor stores.History of the Muni City of Wayzata, MN They are sometimes known as \\"Off Sales\\", meaning purchase for off-premises consumption, similar to \\"Off-licence\\" in the UK. A bar or tavern is an \\"On Sale\\" where liquor is consumed on-premises. Municipal liquor stores are sometimes called \\"Munis.\\" In some states (e.g., California, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wisconsin), all alcoholic beverages can be sold practically anywhere, including drug stores and gas stations. In Washington state, all beer and wine are available in specialty stores, grocery stores, convenience stores, department stores, taverns, and other locations. All spirits are available in stores greater than 10,000 sq ft (such as grocery stores, big box liquor chains, and drug stores). There are two exceptions to the 10,000 sq ft rule: 1) former state and contract liquor stores that reopened under private ownership may also sell spirits provided they have been issued a new license from the state; and 2) cities, mostly in rural areas, that do not have a store that meets the minimum floor space may be allowed to sell spirits if the Liquor Control Board deems that there are no sufficient establishments within the trade area. In Los Angeles and most parts of Southern California, Angelenos often colloquially refer \\"liquor store\\" to any convenience store, corner store, minimart, or similar small local neighborhood grocery store. In 2012, Drizly, an alcohol e-commerce platform, launched its service in Boston allowing liquor stores to offer on-demand delivery. Other alcohol e-commerce platforms include Minibar, Saucey, and Bevz.

Recently the province has allowed supermarkets to open attached liquor stores, but with separate entrances. Urban gasoline (petrol) stations and convenience stores may also have attached liquor stores but with separate entrances and ownership. In areas without another liquor retailer within a 15 km radius, any licensed retailer may sell beer, wine, and liquor, including convenience stores, general stores, and gasoline (petrol) stations. The AGLC has retained its monopoly over the wholesaling of imported beer, wine and distilled spirits, although the distribution of these products is done by a private contractor. * British Columbia ‚Äì Alcoholic beverages may be sold only: ** in privately owned retail stores (stores can only be operated by primary liquor license holders, such as bars, pubs and hotels, but the stores can be located off site) ** in government-owned stores, ** in rural government-appointed liquor agencies (which may be a gas station or convenience store). ** There are also VQA (Vintners Quality Alliance) wine stores, which are privately owned. These stores only sell only British Columbia wines that have the VQA designation; these wines are sold at the same price as in the government liquor stores. There are also a limited number of private wine shops, which can sell both British Columbia and non-British Columbia wines. ** In 2012 British Columbia announced it planned to fully privatize liquor wholesale distribution by 2015. In September 2012 the initiative to privatize liquor wholesale distribution was cancelled, a term agreed upon during contract negotiations with the BCGEU. * Manitoba ‚Äì Only hotels may sell chilled domestic beer. Beer, Wine, and Liquor only sold by government owned Liquor Marts. There are also a limited number of private wine retailers in Manitoba as well. * New Brunswick ‚Äì Only government owned liquor stores or rural government appointed liquor agencies may sell beer, wine, and liquor. However, breweries and cottage wineries may sell directly to the public if licensed to do so. * Newfoundland and Labrador ‚Äì Convenience Stores may sell beer that is brewed locally. Wine, liquor and imported beer is only sold by government owned liquor stores, or rural government appointed liquor agencies. * Nova Scotia ‚Äì In the past, only the provincially owned NSLC (Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation) could sell liquor products, including hard liquor, wine, and beer. Many NSLC locations are connected to grocery stores. Over the past five years, the NSLC began to allow a limited number of small private agency stores to operate in rural areas where there is not a NSLC location. * Ontario ‚Äì Brewers Retail Inc. (operating as The Beer Store), originally owned by a co- operative of Ontario brewers but now owned by multinational brewers mostly based outside Canada, is the only privately owned entity that can sell beer. Only the provincially owned Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) may sell hard liquor or wine, though it also sells beer, particularly in small markets that Brewers Retail does not serve. There are also a limited number of privately owned specialty wine stores: Wine Rack, run by Vincor International and The Wine Shop (formerly Vineyards Estate Wines), run by Andres Wines. The province allows Ontario wineries to maintain a fixed number of off-site retail locations under a clause that was grandfathered into legislation when the Canada-US free-trade agreement came into effect in 1989, and further allowed by WTO regulations implemented in 1995. Ontario is the only province where a winery is able to form a partnership with a department store to operate such retail locations. Details on the Vincor and Wal-Mart retail locationsFull details about Ontario's retail alcohol system can be found in the most current LCBO Annual Report. * Prince Edward Island ‚Äì Only government owned liquor stores may sell beer, wine, and liquor. * Qu√©bec ‚Äì Only the provincially owned Soci√©t√© des alcools du Qu√©bec (SAQ) may sell hard liquor. Wine (that is bottled in Qu√©bec or distributed through a Qu√©bec representative) and beer (that is brewed in Qu√©bec or imported beer that is distributed by a local brewer) can be purchased at d√©panneurs (corner stores) and supermarkets. * Saskatchewan ‚Äì Until the 2010s, only hotels, government-owned stores, and rural private/government liquor stores (i.e., private contractors) could sell beer, wine, and liquor. However, since then, the provincial Saskatchewan Liquor Board has licensed private stores in urban areas. Oceania A bottle shop in Prestons, New South Wales * Australia ‚Äì Regulation of alcoholic beverage sales is a state responsibility. Generally, beer, wine and spirits must be purchased at a bottle shop, colloquially known as a bottle-o (pronounced ). These may be a separate section of a supermarket or an individual shop ‚Äì major retail corporations usually have their own bottle shop franchises located close to their supermarket operations. Drinking establishments may also sell liquor for off-site consumption. Drive-through alcoholic retail outlets are common. The state of Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory permit the sale of alcoholic beverages from supermarkets and convenience stores. * New Zealand ‚Äì An off-licence is granted initially for one year and then subsequently renewed every three years. Supermarkets may sell beer, cider and wine with no more than 15% ABV only. Spirits (whisky, brandy, rum, gin, vodka, etc.), including ready to drink (RTD) mixed spirits, must be purchased at separate bottle shops. Most convenience stores, called dairies, are not licensed to sell alcohol. Off-licence is also used for beverage outlets inside sporting venues, whereby alcoholic beverages are bought \\"outside\\" the point-of-sale, even if it was inside a food outlet, because it can be consumed at the stands, but is still consumed within the vicinity of the venue itself, and cannot be taken out of the venue.

A total of 268 air raids were conducted against Chongqing, with more than 11,500, mainly incendiary, bombs dropped. The targets were usually residential areas, business areas, schools, hospitals and other non-military targets. These bombings were probably aimed at cowing the Chinese government, or as part of the planned Sichuan invasion.

As U.S. support waned, the Chinese Air Force found new hope from the lifeline of the Sino-Soviet Treaty; the Chinese Air Force pilots had almost completely transitioned into Soviet-made Polikarpov I-16 and I-15 series of fighter-pursuit aircraft by early 1938. However, with ever increasing Japanese blockade particularly after Chongqing was cut-off from access to the sea after losing Nanning in the Battle of South Guangxi, and with war looming in Europe, the supplies needed by the Chinese were barely trickling in, and the Chinese Air Force had to make do with the increasingly poor flying performance of these Soviet-made fighters burning low-grade 65-70 octane fuel in defense of Chongqing and Chengdu against the fast and high-flying massed formations of Japanese aircraft burning 90+ octane fuel.https://www.bookdepository.com/Aces- Republic-China-Air-Force-Raymond-Cheung/9781472805614 Among the primary and auxiliary airbases used by the Chinese Air Force in the Chongqing and Chengdu defense sector; Baishiyi Airbase, Fenghuangshan, Guangyangba, Shuangliu, Suining, Taipingsi, Xinjin, among others.http://english.cqnews.net/html/2014-09/19/content_32033828.htmThe A6M \\"Zero\\"; born and honed into the super-efficient lithe-fighter of unmatched performance of the time through years of the China war experience The introduction of the Zero-sen fighter plane in 1940, the most advanced production fighter aircraft at the time, ensured the Japanese practically total air supremacy.https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/japans-world-war- ii-zero-fighter-terrified-allies-56647 U.S. support for China had begun in earnest in 1941 with the oil embargo against Japan, and consequently the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor; beginning in 1942, barrels of 100-octane avgas began to increasingly trickle into China over \\"The Hump\\" (mostly destined for USAAF operations) and the Chinese Air Force were provided with new American Republic P-43 Lancer pursuit planes, which in theory with its fast high- altitude performance and good firepower from its 4X 50-caliber machine guns, was exactly the upgrade the Chinese Air Force needed to effectively hit back at the Japanese raiders, but it was proven to be extremely unreliable and may have killed more of its own pilots than the enemies, including veteran pilot and 4th PG CO Major Cheng Hsiao-yu whose P-43 caught fire during a ferrying flight back to combat operations in China and was killed in the ensuing crash.https://www.warbirdforum.com/richdunn.htmhttps://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/1-reason- imperial-japan-attacked-pearl-harbor- oil-88771http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_hsiao- yu.htmhttps://www.historynet.com/salvation-hump-wwii.htm The majority of the Japanese air raids conducted against Chongqing were made with squadrons of medium-heavy bombers composed of Mitsubishi G3Ms, known under Allied codename as \\"Nells\\", Ki-21s \\"Sallys\\", Fiat BR.20 Cicognas (\\"Ruths\\"), and Kawasaki Ki-48 \\"Lilys\\", although towards the end of the war, Mitsubishi G4M \\"Bettys\\", Ki-67 \\"Peggys\\", Nakajima Ki-49 \\"Helens\\", and Yokosuka P1Y \\"Frances\\" were also deployed.

Photo by Carl Mydans In the first two days of the bombing campaign, 54 and 27 Japanese bombers raided Chongqing on 03 and 04 of May 1939 respectively, killing more than five thousand Chinese civilians; Major Deng Mingde (a.k.a. Teng Ming-teh) led the 22nd PS, 4th PG squadron of Polikarpov fighters against the formation of 54 bombers on the first day while shooting down 7, however his deputy commander Zhang Mingsheng (Chang Ming-sheng) was shot down and while parachuting to safety, died of his wounds.http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_ming- teh.htmhttp://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_ming-sheng.htm Two months later, after tens of thousands of deaths, in retaliation for firebombing, the United States embargoed the export of airplane parts to Japan, thus imposing its first economic sanction against that nation. The Japanese began to embark nighttime bombing raids against Chongqing in summer of 1939 in effort to reduce confrontation and casualties from defending Chinese Air Force fighters, however the Chinese pilots had some success in shooting-down the nighttime bombers using \\"lone wolf\\" fighter tactics previously deployed during the Battle of Nanking two years earlier (and similar to the Wilde Sau tactics the Luftwaffe will deploy a few years later), and involves the coordination with a series of manually-operated ground based searchlights illuminating and tracking incoming bombers which can then be seen and targeted by the solitary fighter pilot; fighter ace Liu Zhesheng shot down a bomber in the night of 3 August, 1939 over Chonqing flying \\"lone wolf\\" in such a nighttime intercept mission, among several kills he participated in claiming while battling in defense of Chongqing.https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=939 By mid-1940, the Japanese had employed new tactics to stave-off attacks from defending Chinese fighter aircraft; Chinese air raid early warning net would alert the Chinese Air Force to scramble their fighters towards Japanese bombers approaching Chongqing, however, all this is being monitored by a fast Japanese reconnaissance plane at high-altitude which would then instruct the bombers to circle out of range as the Chinese fighters rose to meet the bombers, and allowing the Chinese fighters to run low on fuel and forcing them to return to base for refueling, after which the reconnaissance plane redirects the bombers to attack the Chinese fighters on the ground refueling.http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_you-hsin.htm The Japanese air raids against Chongqing had become increasingly intense and destructive as bomber formations began to comprise upwards of 150-200 bombers per raid, and massive defensive machine gun fire from the bombers were very effective against increasingly slow Chinese fighter aircraft burning low-grade fuel. With the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in late-1940/early-1941, the stranglehold against arms and fuel shipments to China was then finally met with earnest U.S. scrap metal and oil embargo against Japan and freezing of Japanese assets in summer of 1941.https://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=281https://www.history.com/this- day-in-history/united-states-freezes-japanese- assetshttp://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P- Strategy/Strategy-5.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20071013230714/http://american.edu/TED/ice/japan- oil.htmhttps://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-freezes- japanese-assets The state-of-the-art new Japanese A6M Zero fighters were first deployed into combat in course of the Chongqing and Chengdu bombing raids, and received its first baptism of fire on 13 September 1940; 13 Zeroes of the 12th Kokutai led by Lieutenant Saburo Shindo on the escort of 27 G3M bombers on a raid into Chongqing were met with over 30 Chinese Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters commanded by Maj.

About 4,000 residents who hid in a tunnel were asphyxiated. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States declared war on Japan, and in the reinvigorated support for China against Japanese imperialist aggressions, and an immediate Sino-US cooperation with planning of the Doolittle Raid against Japan in April 1942. The badly needed high-octane avgas in China for the renewed war effort against the Empire of Japan were now increasingly being shipped via the risky Himalayan air-route known as \\"The Hump\\".https://www.airforcemag.com/article/1009hump/ By August 1943, modern interceptor aircraft possessing greater speed and firepower, ground-based radar equipment, and better aircrew training supplied by the US and other Allied nations left the ROCAF in a much better position to fight back and, along with the diversion of Japanese aerial assets in support of the war in the Pacific, helped curtail further Japanese bombing sorties. The last recorded air raid of the campaign took place on 19 December 1944. Total bomb tonnage and raids Three-thousand tons of bombs were dropped on the city between 1939 and 1942. According to photographer Carl Mydans, the spring 1941 bombings were at the time \\"the most destructive shelling ever made on a city\\", although terror bombing grew rapidly during the Second World War: by comparison 2,300 tons of bombs were dropped by Allied bombers on Berlin in a single night during the Battle of Berlin. A total of 268 air raids were conducted against Chongqing. Lawsuit against the Japanese government In March 2006, 40 Chinese who were wounded or lost family members during the bombings sued the Japanese government, demanding 10,000,000 yen (628,973 yuan) each, and asked for apologies. \\"By filing a lawsuit, we want the Japanese people to know about Chongqing bombings,\\" said a victim. By 2015, over 180 Chongqing bombing survivors, including Lu Xianbo and Chen Guifang, have attempted to sue Japan for the war crimes in Japanese courts, seeking compensation and an official apology; a Tokyo District Court ruled against them, Chongqing victims group has vowed to keep pursuing the case, which is really not about monetary compensation, but more about getting official validation of what they suffered through.https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation- world/world/article32532561.htm Gallery File:Chungking_bomb6.jpgVolunteer army leaving Chongqing File:The defense of Chungking ÂõõÂ∑ùÈáçÊÖ∂‰øùË°õÊà∞ ÊäóÊà∞ÁúüÂØ¶Á¥ÄÈåÑÂΩ±Áâá.ogvThe defense of Chongqing References External links * Memorial site * \\"Bombing of Chongqing\\", Nippon News, No. 2. in the official website of NHK.

Biography Wangenheim was born in Berlin, during the Second World War, the son of Konrad Freiherr von Wangenheim, an aristocratic German Cavalry officer who became a well-known horse rider at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, winning a gold medal in Team Eventing. In 1944, while serving on the Eastern Front, his father was taken prisoner and held in a POW camp located in the Soviet Union. He remained imprisoned for almost ten years and was found hanged days before his intended release. After studying architecture for a period of time, Wagenheim decided to pursue his interest in photography. In 1965, he moved to New York City where he worked as a photographer's assistant for David Thorpe and James Moore until 1967.Fashion Theory, edited by Carol di Grappa, Lustrum Press, 1980. He started his own studio the following year and began working for the American edition of Harper's Bazaar, and for the Italian edition of Harper's Bazaar in 1970. American Vogue became his primary outlet in 1972, but he also worked for its German, French and Italian editions, as well as for Esquire, Playboy, Interview, and Viva magazines. Wangenheim is also well known for his advertisements for Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, and Revlon. Supermodel Gia Carangi did her first major fashion shoot with him in October 1978. He took the notorious photographs of Carangi standing naked behind a chain-link fence. Carangi became one of Wangenheim's favorite models and worked with him on several fashion photographs throughout her career. On 9 March 1981, Wangenheim was killed in a single-car crash while on holiday in Saint Martin. At the time of his death, he was in the process of divorcing the former model Regine Jaffry, with whom he had one child.

He is known for playing Cousin Oliver in The Brady Bunch and Martin in Grady. Rist is also known for voicing assorted characters in television shows, games and movies, including Stuffy, the overly-proud stuffed dragon in Doc McStuffins, Whiz in Kidd Video, Star in Balto, Maroda in Final Fantasy X, Choji Akimichi in Naruto, and Michelangelo in the 1990 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Additionally, he and director Anthony C. Ferrante provided music for the Sharknado film and the theme song for the Sharknado franchise. Career =Acting= As a child, Rist played Cousin Oliver in the final six episodes of The Brady Bunch. With the regular children all getting older, his inclusion was intended to reintroduce a cute younger child to the series. However, the plan became moot as the network had opted to not renew the series before his debut. This gave rise to the term \\"Cousin Oliver Syndrome\\", also known as \\"add-a-kid\\". Oliver uttered the final line of the final episode: \\"Me! Cousin Oliver! / Gosh it was only a suggestion;\\" but the character and Rist were subsequently omitted from later original-cast revivals of the series. After The Brady Bunch he co-starred in the Saturday morning comedy Big John, Little John as Little John. He portrayed Glendon Farrell on the David Hartman vehicle Lucas Tanner, Tommy in the series premiere for the short-lived CBS drama series Bronk, and Martin in the short-lived Sanford and Son spin-off Grady in 1975, and in 1976 and 1977 played Ted Baxter's son David on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, along with three episodes of The Bionic Woman.

He made four guest appearances on CHiPs and the short-lived CBS series Whiz Kids, and also played Booger in a failed Revenge of the Nerds TV pilot. In 1986, Rist had a notable supporting role as Milo in the action film, Iron Eagle which was a box-office hit despite being critically panned.Thomas, K. \\"Iron Eagle: Middle-east Rescue Mission,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 18, 2002. As of 2006, Rist was acting, working with music and also working in film production. Rist produced a horror/comedy film, Stump The Band, directed by William Holmes and JoJo Hendrickson. In 2013, he portrayed Robbie the Bus Driver in the camp horror film Sharknado. Rist said in an interview that his friend Anthony C. Ferrante came upon the film's poster at the American Film Market and became enthusiastic about the concept. When Ferrante said that he had been approached to direct the film, Rist insisted that Ferrante take the job, and that if he did, that he should have a part in it. He also mentioned that Sharknado was his very first red carpet premiere. =Voice-over work= As an adult, Rist has worked as a voice actor, such as in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film series (as the voice of Michaelangelo); from 1984 to 1986, he starred in the Saturday morning cartoon Kidd Video, playing the character Whiz both in live-action music videos and animated sequences. He was the voice of Star, an mauve-and-cream Siberian Husky, in the animated 1995 Universal Studios film Balto, and to date, this is his first and only role in a full-length animated film. He was also the voice of Aaron in the PC game Star Warped. An episode of Batman: The Animated Series titled \\"Baby Doll\\" contained a character called Cousin Spunky that was intended to boost sagging ratings of the fictional Baby Doll sitcom, a clear reference to Cousin Oliver (Rist lent his voice to the episode, but did not play Cousin Spunky; his character was an adult). Rist also voices characters Choji Akimichi from Naruto, and Bud Bison from Mega Man Star Force. Rist is currently the voice of Stuffy, Doc's overly proud stuffed dragon, in Disney Junior's hit animated series Doc McStuffins. Recently, he voiced Griffin in Terminator Salvation.

The list of west coast pop bands Rist has performed with numbers in the hundreds. He divides his time between film and music production, performing with Los Angeles alt- country band KingsizeMaybe and rock band Jeff Caudill & The Goodtimes Band (with Jeff Caudill of Orange County punk band Gameface and Michael \\"Popeye\\" Vogelsang of Orange County punk band Farside).

Rist and Ferrante would provide music for the sequel Sharknado 2 as the band Quint, and perform its theme song \\"(The Ballad of) Sharknado\\", which had originally appeared in the first film but few in the initial audience noticed it. Quint was named after the character in Jaws and served as their band's name for future work on the franchise, including the song \\"Crash\\" in Sharknado 3. They also released an EP called Great White Skies with several of the theme song's variants.

There were four planned refueling stops: Honolulu, Hawaii; Wake Island; Guam; and Clark Air Base, Philippines. The flight arrived at Guam at 11:14 GMT after being delayed for minor maintenance on engines numbers 1 and 3 at Honolulu, and later at Wake Island. The aircraft departed from Guam at 12:57 GMT with an estimated time of arrival at the Philippines at 19:16 GMT. The Super Constellation carried nine hours' worth of fuel for the eight-hour flight of . (plaintext) Eighty minutes after departure, at 14:22 GMT, the pilot radioed a routine message and gave his position as being west of Guam at coordinates (). The aircraft was expected to reach at 15:30. At that time, the Guam IFSS experienced temporary communication difficulties with heavy radio static. At 15:39 the Guam radio operator attempted to contact the flight for a position report but was unable to establish contact. The aircraft was not seen or heard from again.  Investigation  The Clark Field Rescue Coordinating Center declared the aircraft missing the morning of March 16, 1962. Navy officials reported that they believed that the aircraft had crashed closer to Guam than the Philippines. At the time of the disappearance, the weather was clear and the sea calm. The Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marines ordered aircraft and ships to the area. The first day of searching continued overnight. During the first two days of the search, vessels crisscrossed of ocean. Secretary of the Army Elvis Stahr told newspapers that \\"we have not given up hope that it will be found and that those aboard are safe,\\" and that a \\"maximum effort\\" was being made. After four days of searching, Major General Theodore R. Milton of the 13th Air Force told newspapers that although the chance of finding survivors was doubtful, every effort would be made \\"as long as there is any hope at all.\\" (plaintext) Search efforts included aircraft from Guam, Clark Field, the US 7th Fleet, and the Air Force at Okinawa. Additionally surface ships and aircraft from numerous U.S. bases in the western Pacific contributed to the search efforts. After eight days, the search was called off. The search, which was at the time one of the largest to ever take place in the Pacific, had covered more than of ocean.(plaintext) = Conspiracy theories = Flight 739 was one of two Flying Tiger Line flights with military connections that were destroyed under similar circumstances on the same day. This led both airline officials and the media to offer suggestions of sabotage and conspiracy. Both Flight 739 and the other aircraft, an L-1049 Super Constellation, departed from Travis Air Force Base at around 09:45 PST on Wednesday, March 14, 1962, and both encountered difficulties several hours later. The other aircraft was carrying \\"secret military cargo\\" when it crashed in the Aleutian Islands and caught fire. Flying Tiger Lines released a statement outlining some possible reasons for the two occurrences, including sabotage of either or both aircraft, and kidnapping of Flight 739 and its passengers. The airline also said that these were merely \\"wild guesses\\" and that there was no evidence to support either theory. (plaintext) = Possibility of sabotage = A Liberian tanker, the SS T L Linzen, reported seeing a bright light in the sky near the aircraft's expected position about 90 minutes after the last radio contact. (plaintext) U.S. military officials described it as being a \\"bright light strong enough to light a ship's decks\\". It was reported that the tanker observed a flash of light approximately west of Guam, followed immediately by two red lights falling to the ocean at different speeds. A Civil Aeronautics Board investigation determined that witnesses aboard the tanker also observed what appeared to be vapor trails, and numerous crewmen observed the two fireballs fall into the ocean. The tanker proceeded to the location where the fireballs had been observed to impact the ocean but was unable to find any trace of the falling objects during their six-hour search. A spokesman at the rescue effort headquarters in Guam said that as time passed with no sign of the aircraft, \\"more credence is given to the possibility that the tanker may have seen the missing aircraft explode in flight.\\" Officials with the Flying Tiger Line said that their earlier theories of sabotage would be bolstered were the investigation to reveal that an explosion had occurred. The executive vice president of operations said that experts considered it impossible for explosions to occur on the Super-Constellation in the course of normal operation. Additionally he claimed that there was nothing powerful enough aboard the aircraft to completely blow it apart, and that \\"something violent must have happened.\\" The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that, given the observations of the tanker crew, the flight most likely exploded in midair. As no part of the wreckage was ever found, the CAB was unable to establish a determination of cause.

Location It is in the parish of Arthuret and on the River Esk. Longtown is to the north of Carlisle and to the east of Dumfries. History Historically in Cumberland, nearby was the Battle of Arfderydd in 573. The Battle of Solway Moss was fought nearby in 1542. =2001 UK Foot and mouth crisis= Longtown is the location of the largest sheep markets in England. The first animal to be found infected with foot-and-mouth disease in the 2001 crisis had been purchased at Longtown Market. While at the market it spread the infection to other animals. The size of the Longtown Sheep Market meant that the disease had spread right across the country in a very short time. Longtown became the centre for control of the disease in south western Scotland and North West England. Governance Longtown is in the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and the Border. Neil Hudson was elected its Conservative Member of Parliament at the 2019 General Election, replacing Rory Stewart.

The company is exploring as far north as Evertown near Canonbie, and as far south as Longtown.The Cumberland News 7 March 2014 'Coal- mining scheme set to expand' =DMC Longtown= During the 1930s, there was a recognition of a need to provide secure storage for munitions across the United Kingdom. The proposal was to create three Central Ammunition Depots (CAD): one in the south (Monkton Farleigh, Wiltshire); one in the Midlands (Nesscliffe, Shropshire); and one in the north. While the other two sites were sat above easily hewn limestone, Longtown is located above granite, which meant that it took longer to create and only came into operations late in the Second World War. The site was chosen as it used to be part of HM Factory, Gretna, that stretched to Eastriggs over the border in Scotland, one of the biggest makers of explosives during the First World War. The township of Gretna was established to house the workers of this establishment. Today, DMC (Defence Munitions Centre) Longtown is the only one of the three CADs to remain in operation and is among the largest defence munitions sites in Western Europe. Currently, Longtown and Eastriggs are two separate sites under joint management. In November 2013 the MoD announced that the operational capacity of MoD Longtown would be reduced and a substantial area of the site would be given over to commercial use.

Sparklehorse was active from 1995 until Linkous' 2010 death. Prior to forming Sparklehorse, Linkous fronted local bands Johnson Family and Salt Chunk Mary. Only one song, \\"Someday I Will Treat You Good,\\" survived from these earlier bands to be played by Sparklehorse. Linkous stated that he ultimately chose Sparklehorse for a name because the two words sounded good together and it could loosely be used as a metaphor for a motorcycle. At its inception, members of Sparklehorse included Paul Watson (banjo, cornet, lap steel and electric guitar), Scott Minor (drums, chord organ, banjo), Johnny Hott (Wurlitzer organ, percussion, backing vocals), and Scott Fitzsimmons (standup bass). History Sparklehorse's first album, Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot (1995), produced by Cracker frontman David Lowery (musician) who is credited as \\"David Charles\\" on the record, was a modest college radio success. In 1996, while touring Europe with Radiohead shortly after the album's release, Mark Linkous consumed a combination of anti-depressants, valium, alcohol, and heroin in a London hotel room.HARP Magazine Unconscious and with his legs pinned beneath him for almost fourteen hours, the resulting potassium build-up caused his heart to stop for several minutes after his body was lifted up. The ensuing surgery almost caused him to lose the use of both legs and as a result he needed to use a wheelchair for six months and he required dialysis for acute kidney failure. Good Morning Spider (1998) was recorded following this incident. Critics have conjectured that Linkous's brush with death inspired the sombre tone of the album, though Linkous stated that much of the material on GMS had already been written. One song that did result from it is \\"St. Mary\\", which is dedicated to the nurses at the eponymous hospital in Paddington where Linkous recuperated. In 1999 Sparklehorse performed at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto.\\"Live Reviews: Sparklehorse/Varnaline April 13, 1999 The Horseshoe Tavern, Toronto\\".

Chart Attack, September 04, 2001 By: Debbie Bento, Jenny Yuen Whereas much of Vivadixie... and Spider were recorded solely by Linkous on his Virginia farm, the new album was a more collaborative work. Linkous expressed his satisfaction with the overall sound of It's a Wonderful Life, which was engineered by Joel Hamilton, while also claiming that he would have preferred to include more experimental and instrumental material. On September 25, 2006, Sparklehorse released their fourth album, Dreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain, collaborating with Danger Mouse, Christian Fennesz, and Steven Drozd. This album featured the radio release \\"Don't Take My Sunshine Away\\" and a remastered version of \\"Shade And Honey\\", which Linkous originally wrote for Alessandro Nivola to sing in the 2003 movie Laurel Canyon, as well as a virtually unchanged re-release of \\"Morning Hollow,\\" the bonus track from It's a Wonderful Life. In 2008, Sparklehorse recorded a cover of the song \\"Jack's Obsession,\\" from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas for the official compilation album Nightmare Revisited. In 2009, Sparklehorse teamed up with Danger Mouse and David Lynch in the project Dark Night of the Soul. Corliss et al. (2010) describe Dark Night of the Soul as ‚Äúspooky, beautiful, (and)‚Ä¶ bittersweet‚Ä¶considering Linkous‚Äô untimely death.‚Äù In 2009, Linkous teamed up with electronic ambient-music artist Christian Fennesz to create In the Fishtank 15, a wafting album EP of experimentation and dreamy atmospherics. The last four live shows, Linkous did together with Fennesz during a European tour that was held during October 2009.

This is as opposed to height above mean sea level (AMSL or HAMSL), or (in broadcast engineering) height above average terrain (AAT or HAAT). In other words, these expressions (AGL, AMSL, AAT) indicate where the \\"zero level\\" or \\"reference altitude\\" - the vertical datum - is located.  Aviation  A pilot flying an aircraft under instrument flight rules (typically under poor visibility conditions) must rely on the aircraft's altimeter to decide when to deploy the undercarriage and prepare for landing. Therefore, the pilot needs reliable information on the height of the plane with respect to the landing area (usually an airport). The altimeter, which is usually a barometer calibrated in units of distance instead of atmospheric pressure, can therefore be set in such a way as to indicate the height of the aircraft above ground. This is done by communicating with the control tower of the airport (to get the current surface pressure) and setting the altimeter so as to read zero on the ground of that airport. Confusion between AGL and AMSL, or improper calibration of the altimeter, may result in controlled flight into terrain, a crash of a fully functioning aircraft under pilot control. While the use of a barometric altimeter setting that provides a zero reading on the ground of the airport is a reference available to pilots, in commercial aviation it is a country-specific procedure that is not often used (it is used, e.g., in Russia, and a few other countries). Most countries (Far East, North and South America, all of Europe, Africa, Australia) use the airport's AMSL (above mean sea level) elevation as a reference. During approaches to landing, there are several other references that are used, including AFE (above field elevation) which is height referencing the highest point on the airfield, TDZE (touchdown zone elevation) or TH (threshold height) which both refer to the elevation of the landing end of the runway measured AMSL and AGL respectively. In general, \\"altitude\\" refers to distance above mean sea level (MSL or AMSL), \\"height\\" refers to distance above a particular point (e.g. the airport, runway threshold, or ground at present location), and \\"elevation\\" describes a feature of the terrain itself in terms of distance above MSL. One mnemonic that can be used is: if it's an altitude you can fly there, if it's an elevation you can walk there, and if it's height that's how far a rock will fall before it hits the ground.  Atmospheric sciences  In weather and climate studies, measurements or simulations often need to refer to a specific height or altitude, which is naturally AGL. However, the values of geophysical variables measured in various places on the natural (ground) surface may not be easily compared in hilly or mountainous terrain, because part of the observed variability is due to changes in the altitude of the surface. For this reason, variables such as pressure or temperature are sometimes 'reduced' to mean sea level. In general circulation models and global climate models, the state and properties of the atmosphere are specified or computed at a number of discrete locations and heights. When the topography of the continents is explicitly represented, the altitudes of these locations are set above the simulated ground level. This is often implemented using the so-called sigma coordinate system, which is the ratio of the pressure at a location (latitude, longitude, altitude) divided by the pressure at the nadir of that location on ground surface (same latitude, same longitude, altitude AGL = 0).  Broadcasting  In broadcasting, altitude AGL has relatively little direct bearing on the broadcast range of a station. Rather, it is HAAT (the height above the average terrain (in the surrounding area)) which is used to determine how far a broadcast station (or any other sort of VHF or higher radio-frequency) transmission will travel. From aviation safety perspective though, the more important aspect is the height of the radio tower used to support the radio antenna. In this case, height AGL is the only important measurement for aviation authorities, which require that some tall towers have proper Aircraft warning paint and lights to avoid collisions.

It consists of two units, with all four tracks powered. It can carry up to 17 people (6 in the front compartment, 11 in the rear), and the trailer unit can be adapted for different uses (see Variants section). An armored Bv 206S ambulance of the German Army History US Marines in a Norwegian Bv 206 traveling through snow Development of the Bv 206 all-terrain articulated tracked carrier began in 1974. Three batches of trial vehicles were delivered between 1976 and 1978 and the first production examples were delivered to the Swedish Defense Administration in 1980. Like its predecessor, the Volvo Bv 202, the Bv 206 is designed to carry troops and equipment through snow and bog-lands in northern Sweden. The low ground pressure enables the Bv 206 to cope with a wide range of difficult conditions. It is also fully amphibious, with a speed in water of up to . Over 11,000 have been produced and they are used in more than 37 countries worldwide. The total load capacity is and a trailer of up to gross weight can also be towed behind the second compartment. The Bv 206 is referred to as a Small Unit Support Vehicle (SUSV) pronounced \\"susvee\\" in United States service. U.S. military variants include the standard model (M973), a tactical operations center variant (M1065), an ambulance variant (M1066) and a flat-bed cargo carrier (M1067). U.S. military models are fitted with a 6-cylinder Mercedes diesel engine and a non-halon fire suppression system since 1997 due to several cases where the front car caught fire and burned to the frame. A Bv 206D being transported by a German Army CH-53 Users include the American and Australian Antarctic research organizations and British, Icelandic and Canadian search and rescue services. They are also used for search and rescue services in the Austrian alpine region. The Bv 206 was used in combat by the Canadian Army during Operation Anaconda. The Singapore Armed Forces uses the Bv 206, and recently transferred several of them to the Singapore Civil Defense Force for use as a firefighting platform. Decommissioned units have been purchased by private owners and rented as transports, particularly in Alberta, Canada, to access remote oil wells, as well as cut blocks which need to be reforested by tree planting. The Bv 206 is used in Antarctica, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Indonesia, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Variants This tracked vehicle, a Swedish H√§gglunds Bv 206, achieves low ground pressure through full-length, wide rubber tracks and a lightweight body.

Canadian troops taking part in Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan made good use of this vehicle, riding over rough mountainous terrain with full combat gear, allowing the men to avoid the exhaustion they would have felt moving on foot at such high altitudes and in such conditions. The UK is looking to replace its Bv206Ds by 2020. =BvS 10= The BvS 10, not to be confused with the Bv 206 or Bv 206S, is a much larger (therefore equipped with a 6-cylinder Steyr M1 engine with 200 kWBAE Haegglund BVS 10 M16 SCI: Steyr-Motors.com) and fully amphibious armoured vehicle based upon the characteristic twin-cab, articulated steering system typical of H√§gglunds all terrain vehicles. It was originally designed for the British Royal Marines Commandos and named All Terrain Vehicle (Protected) - ATV(P) VIKING. It is in service with the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group and the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps while the French Army have recently ordered 130 Bvs10s. It's planned for Italian Army. = BvS 10 Beowulf = The BvS 10 Beowulf is essentially an unarmored version of the BvS 10 Viking. =Other variants= Other variants exist including mortar launcher, cargo carrier, fuel carrier, radar, command post and radio relay.

The Codex Belli, literally Laws of Battle, are a ruleset for unchoreographed semi-contact combat with medieval reenactment weapons, which differ most notably from realistic replicas in that they have rounded edges and points. The goal of this ruleset was to create a common standard for safe fighting practices as lower-scale reenactment events grew larger and a trust-based system became insufficient with the increasing number of reenactors involved. Numerous German medieval reenactment groups have adopted the Codex Belli as a standard ruleset for combat reenactment, in preference to custom rules based on other groups, such as the SCA. Among other things, its application at major national reenactment events has led to an increasing popularity, although critics have attempted to establish different systems.  Hit Point Rules  Although the Codex Belli itself doesn't specify any rules for counting hits, two variants have become widely accepted at German events. These variants differ only in how many hit points an unarmoured combatant (e.g. someone wearing a gambeson, padded vest, or no armour at all) starts out with. Some groups prefer setting that default to a single hit point, which leads to shorter battles and strongly favours chainmail, which grants the wearer one additional hit point, or plate armour, which grants the wearer two or more hit points, usually depending on whether it is a half-plate or full plate. The other common variant is giving unarmoured combatants three hit points, which lowers the advantage of heavy armour, especially in longer battles where armoured combatants often tire out faster than unarmoured ones because of the added weight of metal armour. Generally any hit counts as a single hit and deducts one of the victim's \\"lives\\" or \\"hit points\\", usually resulting in death in case of the single-hit variant. Some variations count hits with a projectile, such as an arrow or crossbow bolt, twice because the added range gives the victim more time to react than when having to deal with a melee attacker. Sometimes, especially in training battles, trainees with little prior experience or who haven't been in a many-against-many combat before are granted an additional hit point. Combinations of these rules rarely result in a total number of hit-points greater than six using the triple-hit rule or four using the single-hit rule.  Critique  Since some interpretations of the Codex Belli go as far as banning hits against the entire length of the lower arms and lower legs, shields have become the standard choice for a secondary weapon in these combats because they can cover the entire legal hit area (torso, upper arms and upper legs). As a result, the unusual practice of attempting to hit the opponent on the back while facing him from the front has become increasingly popular because it seems to be the easiest way to score a hit when both combatants are using a sword and shield combination. This is not only a very artificial technique, it is also criticised for provoking injuries in the upper body area or, especially in the absence of a solid helmet, on the head ‚Äî both of which the Codex Belli was supposed to protect ‚Äî by being based on the idea of the attacker trying to strike downwards from above the opponent's shoulder, which requires an upward movement of the sword.

Biography He was born on January 4, 1847, in Albany, New York to Andrew James Colvin, a wealthy lawyer, and his second wife, Margaret Crane Alling; his first name was his grandmother's maiden name.Webb, Nina H., Footsteps through the Adirondacks, The Verplanck Colvin Story, Utica: North Country Books, 1996. . He was tutored for several years before entering The Albany Academy; then, during the Civil War the family moved to Nassau; there he attended Nassau Academy, where he excelled in the sciences, and graduated in 1864. Although he preferred attending West Point Military Academy, he joined his father's law office in Albany and was later admitted to the bar. Working in real estate law gave him his first experience in surveying. \\"Measurement of Whiteface Mountain with Spirit-Level and graduated Rod\\", drawn by Verplanck Colvin, published in the Seventh Report of the Adirondack Survey, 1881 In 1865, when Colvin was 18, Alfred Billings Street gave him a copy of his 1860 book, Woods and Waters, about his adventures in the Adirondack Mountains. The next three years, Colvin spent his summers exploring the Adirondack wilderness. By 1869, he had formed the idea of doing a geological survey of the Adirondack region. To gain experience, he recruited friend Mills Blake for a trip to nearby the Helderberg Mountain; he wrote an illustrated report of the trip that was published in Harpers New Monthly Magazine, a national publication. \\"Adirondack Survey Sketch by Verplanck Colvin, 1873. During the summer of 1869 he climbed Mount Marcy, and in 1870 made the first recorded ascent of Seward Mountain. During the ascent of Seward, Colvin saw the extensive damage being done by lumbermen in the Adirondacks. His report of the climb was read at the Albany Institute, where it garnered the attention of state officials, and was printed in the annual report of the New York State Museum of Natural History. In it, he tied clear- cutting of Adirondack forests to reduced water flow in the state's canals and rivers, an idea that had first appeared in George Perkins Marsh's Man and Nature, published in 1864.Terrie, Phillip G., Contested Terrain; A New History of Nature and People in the Adirondacks, Syracuse: Adirondack Museum/Syracuse University Press, 1997. . In 1872 he applied to New York for a stipend to cover the costs of a survey; he was subsequently named to the newly created post of Superintendent of the Adirondack Survey and given a $1000 budget by the state legislature to institute a survey of the Adirondacks. He was an able administrator, managing crews of up to 100 men separated by difficult terrain with only primitive communication methods. He also designed and built some tools for the job, including a folding canvas boat, and a wind powered spinning reflector to enable precise sighting of a mountain top from many miles away. Inscription to Geology Professor W.H. Niles of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Verplanck Colvin on the first page of his Annual Report on the Progress of the Topographical Survey of the Adirondack Wilderness of New York for the Year 1873 During the first year he discovered Lake Tear-of-the-Clouds, often considered the source of the Hudson River. He directed surveying parties throughout the Adirondacks and determined the altitudes of most of the highest peaks, becoming obsessed with his task. Determined to fix the precise altitude of Mount Marcy (having decided that the barometric method of determining altitude was insufficiently accurate) he established a series of 111 elevation benchmarks along the course of a forty mile trek from Westport on Lake Champlain to the summit of Marcy, each intermediate altitude being calculated to a precision of one-thousandth of a foot. As the crew approached the summit of Marcy, they encountered an October snow storm with ice and freezing rain; despite urging by his guides and assistants to wait for better weather, Colvin pushed on despite the danger of becoming trapped in Panther Gorge.Terrie, Phillip G., Forever Wild, Environmental Aesthetics and the Adirondack Preserve, Philadelphia: Temple University Press. 1985. . pp. 80, 81 At 4:50 PM on November 4, 1875, Colvin took the final observation on the summit of Mt. Marcy and determined its elevation to be 5,344.311 feet above mean tide level in the Hudson. Upon his return to Panther Gorge later that evening, Colvin wrote \\"Joy reigned in the camp to-night, for we had accomplished the work in the face of the greatest difficulties; when the most experienced guide had ventured to say that it was for this season impossible. In honor of the event we had a choice supper of bear's meat fried, boiled and stewed, and hard bread and biscuit; then, unmindful of the snow storm beating in and around our open shanty, fell fast asleep.\\" In 1873 he wrote a report arguing that if the Adirondack watershed was allowed to deteriorate, it would threaten the viability of the Erie Canal, which was then vital to New York's economy, and that the entire Adirondack region should therefore be protected by the creation of a state forest preserve. He was subsequently appointed superintendent of the New York state land survey, which led to the creation of the Adirondack Forest Preserve in 1885. His work ended in 1900 when then Governor Theodore Roosevelt transferred his duties to the state engineer. Big Slide Mountain He was a member of numerous scientific societies and was president of the department of physical science at the Albany Institute. About 1881, at Hamilton College, he delivered lectures on geodesy, surveying, and topographical engineering. His maps, reports, illustrations and notes form a large part of the archives of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in Albany and are often referred to by present-day surveyors. In 1891, he ran on the Republican ticket for New York State Engineer and Surveyor but was defeated by Democrat Martin Schenck.

The young Onfray, however, did not appreciate his new environment, which he describes as a place of suffering. Onfray went on to graduate with a teaching degree in philosophy. He taught this subject to senior students at a high school that concentrates on technical degrees in Caen between 1983 and 2002. At that time, he and his supporters established the Universit√© populaire de Caen, proclaiming its foundation on a free-of-charge basis and on the manifesto written by Onfray in 2004 (La communaut√© philosophique). Onfray is an atheist and author of Trait√© d'Ath√©ologie (Atheist Manifesto), which \\"became the number one best-selling nonfiction book in France for months when it was published in the Spring of 2005 (the word 'atheologie' Onfray borrowed from Georges Bataille). This book repeated its popular French success in Italy, where it was published in September 2005 and quickly soared to number one on Italy's bestseller lists.\\" In the 2002 election, Onfray endorsed the French Revolutionary Communist League and its candidate for the French presidency, Olivier Besancenot. In 2007, he endorsed Jos√© Bov√©, but eventually voted for Olivier Besancenot, and conducted an interview with the future French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who, he declared for Philosophie Magazine, was an \\"ideological enemy\\".Nicolas Sarkozy et Michel Onfray - CONFIDENCES ENTRE ENNEMIS http://www.philomag.com/article,dialogue,nicolas-sarkozy-et-michel-onfray- confidences-entre-ennemis,288.php His book Le cr√©puscule d'une idole : L'affabulation freudienne (The Twilight of an Idol: The Freudian Confabulation), published in 2010, has been the subject of considerable controversy in France because of its criticism of Freud. He recognizes Freud as a philosopher, but he brings attention to the considerable cost of Freud's treatments and casts doubts on the effectiveness of his methods. In 2015, he published Cosmos, the first book of a trilogy. Onfray considers ironically that it constitutes his \\"very first book\\".  Philosophy  Onfray writes that there is no philosophy without self-psychoanalysis. He describes himself as an atheist\\"He is a self-described hedonist, atheist, libertarian, and left-wing anarchist\\".(en) France, Media, Michel Onfray, A self labeled Anarchist Philosopher and considers theistic religion to be indefensible. = View on the history of Western philosophy and philosophical project = Onfray has published 9 books under a project of history of philosophy called Counter- history of Philosophy. In each of these books Onfray deals with a particular historical period in western philosophy. The series of books are composed by the titles I. Les Sagesses Antiques (2006) (on western antiquity), II. Le Christianisme h√©doniste (2006) (on Christian hedonism from the Renaissance period), III. Les libertins baroques (2007) (on libertine thought from the Baroque era), IV. Les Ultras des Lumi√®res (2007) (on radical enlightenment thought), V. L'Eud√©monisme social (2008) (on radical utilitarian and eudomonistic thought), VI. Les Radicalit√©s existentielles (2009) (on 19th and 20th century radical existentialist thinkers) and VII. La construction du surhomme: Jean-Marie Guyau, Friedrich Nietzsche (on Guyau¬¥s and Nietzsche¬¥s philosophy in relation to the concept of the √úbermensch). VIII. Les Freudiens h√©r√©tiques (2013). IX. Les Consciences r√©fractaires (2013). In an interview he establishes his view on the history of philosophy. For him: > There is in fact a multitude of ways to practice philosophy, but out of this > multitude, the dominant historiography picks one tradition among others and > makes it the truth of philosophy: that is to say the idealist, spiritualist > lineage compatible with the Judeo-Christian world view. From that point on, > anything that crosses this partial ‚Äì in both senses of the word ‚Äì view of > things finds itself dismissed. This applies to nearly all non-Western > philosophies, Oriental wisdom in particular, but also sensualist, empirical, > materialist, nominalist, hedonistic currents and everything that can be put > under the heading of \\"anti-Platonic philosophy\\". Philosophy that comes down > from the heavens is the kind that ‚Äì from Plato to Levinas by way of Kant and > Christianity ‚Äì needs a world behind the scenes to understand, explain and > justify this world. The other line of force rises from the earth because it > is satisfied with the given world, which is already so much. \\"His mission is to rehabilitate materialist and sensualist thinking and use it to re-examine our relationship to the world. Approaching philosophy as a reflection of each individual's personal experience, Onfray inquires into the capabilities of the body and its senses and calls on us to celebrate them through music, painting, and fine cuisine.\\" = Hedonism = He defines hedonism \\"as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others, without harming yourself or anyone else.\\" \\"Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism, a joyous utilitarianism, and a generalized aesthetic of sensual materialism that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent - while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art, politics, and everyday life and decisions.\\" Onfray's works \\"have explored the philosophical resonances and components of (and challenges to) science, painting, gastronomy, sex and sensuality, bioethics, wine, and writing. His most ambitious project is his projected six-volume Counter-history of Philosophy\\", of which three have been published. For Onfray: > In opposition to the ascetic ideal advocated by the dominant school of > thought, hedonism suggests identifying the highest good with your own > pleasure and that of others; the one must never be indulged at the expense > of sacrificing the other. Obtaining this balance ‚Äì my pleasure at the same > time as the pleasure of others ‚Äì presumes that we approach the subject from > different angles ‚Äì political, ethical, aesthetic, erotic, bioethical, > pedagogical, historiographical.... His philosophy aims for \\"micro-revolutions\\", or \\"revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic, libertarian values.\\"  Relation to hedonism  In La puissance d'exister: Manifeste h√©doniste, Onfray claims that the political dimension of hedonism runs from Epicurus to John Stuart Mill through Jeremy Bentham and Claude Adrien Helv√©tius. What political hedonism aims for is to create the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers. = Atheism = Blogger J. M. Cornwell praised Onfray's Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, claiming it \\"is a religious and historical time capsule\\" containing what he sees as \\"the true deceptions of theological philosophy\\". Recently he has been involved in promoting the work of Jean Meslier,Michel Onfray, \\"Jean Meslier and 'The Gentle Inclination of Nature\\" (translated into English by Marvin Mandel), New Politics, Winter 2006 an 18th-century French Catholic priest who was discovered, upon his death, to have written a book-length philosophical essay promoting atheism. In the atheist manifesto, Onfray has said that among the \\"incalculable number of contradictions and improbabilities in the body of the text of the synoptic Gospels\\"[Atheist Manifesto, 127] two claims are made: crucifixion victims were not laid to rest in tombs, and in any case Jews were not crucified in this period. Ancient Historian John Dickson, of Macquarie University, has said that Philo of Alexandria, writing about the time of Jesus, says that sometimes the Romans handed the bodies of crucifixion victims over to family members for proper burial. The Roman Jewish historian Flavius Josephus even remarks: \\"the Jews are so careful about funeral rites that even malefactors who have been sentenced to crucifixion are taken down and buried before sunset\\".[Josephus, Jewish War 4.317] Regarding the second claim, Dickson calls this a \\"clear historical blunder\\". In his latest book, D√©cadence he argued for Christ myth theory, which is a hypotheses that Jesus was not a historical person. Onfray based this on the fact that, other than in the New Testament, Jesus is barely mentioned in accounts of the period.  Universit√© populaire de Caen  Onfray was a high school philosophy teacher for two decades until he resigned in 2002 to establish a tuition-free Universit√© Populaire (People's University) at Caen, at which he and several colleagues teach philosophy and other subjects. > \\"The Universit√© Populaire, which is open to all who cannot access the state > university system, and on principle does not accept any money from the State > -- Onfray uses the profits from his books to help finance it -- has had > enormous success. Based on Onfray's book La Communaut√© Philosophique: > Manifeste pour l'Universit√© Populaire (2004), the original UP now has > imitators in Picardy, Arras, Lyon, Narbonne, and Le Mans, with five more in > preparation.\\" \\"The national public radio network France Culture annually broadcasts his course of lectures to the Universit√© Populaire on philosophical themes.\\"  Awards and honors  Asteroid 289992 Onfray, discovered by astronomers at the Saint-Sulpice Observatory in 2005, was named in his honor.

Born in Sturgis, Michigan, MacCloy moved to Toledo, Ohio as a child. Theater In 1928 she joined Vanities, produced by Earl Carroll, but her mother forced her to quit due to her skimpy costume. When she was a teenager, MacCloy was chosen by song writer/producer Lew Brown (of the prolific team DeSylva, Brown & Henderson) to impersonate Broadway star Harry Richman, singing \\"I'm On The Crest of a Wave\\" in the ninth edition of George White's Scandals (Apollo Theater, July 2, 1928; 230 performances). Just prior to making her first movie MacCloy was working in New York City clubs such as the Abbey and Chateau Madrid. She also toured with a Parkington Vaudeville Unit, which used the designing talents of a young Vincente Minnelli. After her film d√©but she appeared with Lupe V√©lez, Bert Lahr, Buddy Rogers and June Knight in \\"Hot-Cha\\", Florenz Ziegfeld's last production (Ziegfeld Theater, March 8, 1932; 119 performances). Her big number was \\"Little Old New York\\" by Lew Brown and Ray Henderson. Movies Signed by Paramount Pictures in 1930, she was loaned out to United Artists for her first feature, Reaching for the Moon (film) (1931), starring Bebe Daniels, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Edward Everett Horton and Claud Allister. She plays 'Kitty,' Bebe Daniels' flirtatious best friend. The director, Edmund Goulding, was casting another Fairbanks film when he heard about MacCloy and wired her to come and test. Her first Paramount film was June Moon (released March 21, 1931), based on the play by George S. Kaufman and Ring Lardner. Subsequently, MacCloy appeared in a variety of shorts and some features with stars such as Jack Oakie, Frances Dee and ZaSu Pitts. With co-stars Gertrude Short and Marion Shilling, she made a series of shorts for RKO-Path√© called The Gay Girls. One of her directors was the then disgraced Fatty Arbuckle. She co-starred with Leon Errol in the second full Technicolor film Good Morning, Eve! (1934), released just after another Leon Errol short Service With a Smile (1934). MacCloy is probably best remembered today for her last major film role in Go West (1940), starring the Marx Brothers. Singer MacCloy subsequently sang with dance orchestras, including Johnny Hamp, Henry King, Jimmie Grier and Ben Pollack. In San Francisco she was featured with the Williams-Walsh Orchestra (Griff Williams and Jimmy Walsh) at the Hotel Mark Hopkins. Her band work took her to Chicago and many other cities. Private life In March 1931, MacCloy was sued for divorce in Cincinnati, Ohio by Wilbur Guthlein, whom she married in the 1920s. MacCloy married Schuyler Schenck in 1931 and divorced him in 1933. In December 1941, she married architect and fellow jazz enthusiast Neal Wendell Butler, with whom she raised two children. They remained married until his death in 1985. MacCloy died May 5, 2005 of natural causes.

The District serves approximately 6000 students in the cities of Cotati and Rohnert Park and neighboring areas of Sonoma County. The district operates six elementary schools, two middle schools, a K-8 school, one comprehensive high school, a magnet school and charters two schools. The district's offices are located at 7165 Burton Avenue, Rohnert Park, CA 94928-3316. The district is supported by numerous school-connected organizations, which include PTAs, Boosters and the Education Foundation of Cotati & Rohnert Park, a non-profit organization founded in 1983 to provide private grants to the school district. Since its founding, the organization has made grants totaling over $850,000 to the district's schools. The district is governed by a board consisting of Tracy Farrell (term expires 2018), Marc Orloff (term expires 2018), Timothy Nonn (term expires 2020), Jennifer Wiltermood (term expires 2020), and Leffler Brown (term expires 2018).http://crpusd.schoolwires.net/Page/84 The superintendent is Dr. Robert Haley.http://crpusd.schoolwires.net/domain/19 History The building of schools always reflects growth. In 1900, there was only an 8-grade, one-room school house located on land donated by the Pages. When the first Rohnert Park children started attending school in Cotati, there were less than 250 students and only one school in Cotati School District. The Cotati-Rohnert Park School District today is a complete system. Many schools have been built. John Reed was the first school in Rohnert Park (dedicated in January, 1962), thereafter, Waldo Rohnert, Thomas Page (in Cotati), and La Fiesta Elementary Schools, Rohnert Park Jr. High School, and Rancho Cotate Sr. High School were built. Rohnert Park also has facilities for higher education---Sonoma State College. In 1957, the California legislature appropriated $500,000 for the purchase of a site for a \\"North Bay Counties Four Year College\\" in the Santa Rosa‚ÄîPetaluma corridor to serve Marin, Sonoma, and Solano Counties. Many sites were considered. Rohnert Park had the most to offer, however: the ability to provide water and sewer services, and a central location. The 99-year agreement to extend these services provides that Rohnert Park may annex the College site into the City at any time, but no other City may annex the College. Ambrose Nichols presided as the College's first President when, five years later, the College was opened to students in the temporary quarters along College View Drive (behind the shopping center on Southwest Blvd.). In the fall of 1966, the permanent buildings located on 200 acres of the old Benson Ranch were finally opened for classes and the College was in full swing. The City has grown in both population and acreage. The population growth was strong and steady for a decade, from 2,775 at incorporation to 6,300 in 1970 when Rohnert Park surpassed Healdsburg as the third largest City in the County. Then the City rapidly grew; the population more than doubled to 15,100 by 1977. The pattern of the City's growth with respect to size is just the reverse: ambitious in the early years, but slow since 1968. The original District consisted of the 2,700 acre Rohnert land and the 580 acre Brians land. When the City incorporated, however, only a part of the District was included in the City limits, 1,325 acres. The City grew between 1962 and 1968 to 3,812 acres. Several of the annexations were routine. Some of the proposals to annex additional lands became heated battles with people to the north and south. The golf course and country club subdivisions were annexed, so was the high school site, land for Rancho Verde and Rancho Feliz mobilehome parks, and the \\"L\\" neighborhood. But lands to the north of Wilfred Road and acreage around the College were never annexed. The most ambitious proposal of the City Council was the tongue-in-cheek resolution to annex the entire city of Santa Rosa. (This unanimously passed resolution was not kindly received by the City to the north.)

Education Gordon graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. from Harvard University in 1962. He then attended Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar and received his B.A. in 1964. He received his Ph.D. from MIT in 1967 with a dissertation titled Problems in the Measurement of Real Investment in the U.S. Private Economy. Career and contributions From 1995 to 1997, he served on the Boskin Commission to assess the accuracy of the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI), having written the definitive criticism of CPI inflation overstatement in 1990. He is also a member of the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the NBER, which determines when recessions start and end. Robert J. Gordon's popular text Macroeconomics was the first to incorporate the rational expectations hypothesis into the analysis of the Phillips curve. Soon all subsequent macro textbooks were expounding the \\"Expectations Augmented Phillips Curve.\\" In addition, Gordon has written for economic journals, outlining the relation of the productivity growth of modern-day inventions to the great inventions of the late 19th century. He focuses on the impact of computers in the post-1995 economy on the durable manufacturing sector. Furthermore, he emphasises the marginal productivity of computing technology affects standard of living in a much more contained fashion than the earlier great American inventions. He downplays the role of computer technology in the economic growth of the latter 20th century in accounting for business cycle and trends. In addition, he also questions the actual productivity of such technological developments. Family Gordon is a member of a family of economists. Both his parents Robert Aaron and Margaret earned distinction independently, each contributing to economic knowledge with a view to real practical benefit for society, as did his brother David, himself more of a radical. For example, his father is the namesake of the \\"Gordon Report\\" which proposed reforms for the computation of the unemployment rate by the US Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics.

At one time, Jackson pushed SLAM publisher Dennis Page to put Allen Iverson on the cover of the magazine while Iverson was still playing basketball at Georgetown University, threatening to resign if this did not happen. In addition to his regular feature articles for SLAM, in 2004 Jackson began to write a back-page column named \\"Game Point\\", in which he aired opinions on various basketball-related topics.

A supposed descendant of Sun Tzu, Sun was tutored in military strategy by the hermit Guiguzi. He was accused of treason while serving in the Wei state and was sentenced to face-tattooing (criminal branding) and had his kneecaps removed, permanently crippling him. Sun escaped from Wei later and rose to prominence in the Qi state, by serving as a military strategist and commander. He led Qi to victory against the Wei state at the Battle of Guiling and Battle of Maling. Sun authored the military treatise Sun Bin's Art of War, which was rediscovered in a 1972 archaeological excavation after being lost for almost 2000 years. Life =Early life= An alleged descendant of Sun Tzu, Sun Bin was recognized for his brilliance at an early age, while he was still studying military strategy under the tutelage of the hermit Guiguzi. He could recite The Art of War, which made Guiguzi remark that all his other students should look up to Sun Bin as a role model. Pang Juan, a fellow student of Guiguzi, became sworn brothers with Sun. Pang left early and went to serve the Wei state as a military general, making his name after scoring victories in a few battles. Sun Bin, who was still studying with their teacher then, was invited to enter the service of Wei and he became Pang's colleague. However, Pang was secretly jealous of Sun, because he perceived that Sun Bin was more talented, and had learnt more about military strategy from their teacher than him. =Mutilation= Pang Juan framed Sun Bin for treason and reported him to King Hui of Wei, who ordered Sun Bin to be executed. Pang pretended to plead for mercy on Sun's behalf, and the king instead condemned Sun to face- tattooing and removal of the kneecaps, effectively branding Sun as a criminal and crippling him for life. Pang pretended to take pity on Sun and treated him well while trying to trick Sun into compiling his knowledge on military strategy into a book, after which Pang could kill him. Sun eventually realized Pang's true intentions and feigned madness. Pang attempted to test whether Sun had really become insane or not, so he had Sun locked up in a pigsty. Sun appeared to enjoy himself there and even consumed animal faeces, calling them delicious. Pang believed that Sun was truly mad and lowered his guard. Sun later escaped from the Wei state with the help of diplomats from the Qi state. =Service in Qi= Map showing Battle of Guiling Map showing Battle of Maling In the Qi state, Sun Bin became a retainer (guest) in the residence of Tian Ji, a military general. Once, King Wei of Qi invited Tian Ji to a horse racing competition. Sun Bin suggested a strategy to Tian Ji to utilize his horses to best advantage, and Tian won two out of three rounds in the race. The king was impressed with Tian's victory. Tian admitted that he won with the help of Sun Bin, and recommended Sun's talents to the king. King Wei wanted to appoint Sun Bin as the commander of the Qi armies. Sun declined, as his handicap prevented him from riding horseback, and would have a negative effect on the morale of soldiers. Sun was then appointed chief military advisor instead and served as Tian Ji's deputy. In 354 BC, Wei state attacked the Zhao state, with Pang Juan leading the Wei army. They besieged the Zhao capital city of Handan. Zhao requested help from Qi, and the king of Qi commissioned Sun Bin and Tian Ji to lead an army to help Zhao. Sun Bin proposed the strategy of \\"besieging Wei to rescue Zhao\\" and the Qi army attacked the Wei capital city of Daliang (present-day Kaifeng), forcing the Wei army to turn back to save the city and effectively lifting the siege on Handan. The Wei army was ambushed and defeated by the Qi forces at the Battle of Guiling. In 342 BC, the Wei army led by Pang Juan invaded the Han state, an ally of the Qi state, and Han requested help from Qi. Sun Bin and Tian Ji were put in charge of the Qi army again to counter the Wei forces. Sun used a strategy of feigning defeat in a series of skirmishes with the Wei forces, in order to lure Pang Juan to pursue him. Sun ordered the Qi troops to reduce the number of cooking stoves they used, to create a false impression that the Qi army was shrinking in size. The pursuing Wei forces led by Pang Juan spotted the trend by observing the marks left behind by the stoves, and Pang fell for Sun Bin's ruse. Eager to defeat Sun Bin, Pang continued the pursuit and fell into an ambush in a narrow valley laid by the Qi forces. The Wei army suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Maling and Pang Juan committed suicide, while the crown prince of Wei was captured by the Qi forces. In traditional folklore, Sun Bin carved the words \\"Pang Juan dies under this tree\\" on a tree in the ambush area. When Pang arrived there, he saw that there were carvings on the tree so he lit a torch for a closer look. Right then, using the torch as the target, the Qi troops lying in ambush attacked. Pang committed suicide after being hit by many enemy arrows. Sun Bin retired from service because of political entanglement in the court and led a reclusive life as a hermit in the later part of his life. Works Sun Bin's Art of War () is a military treatise authored by Sun Bin. The book was believed to be lost after the Han Dynasty, and although there were numerous references to it in post-contemporary texts, some historians still believed that the book was never written and could be a forgery. However, in April 1972, archaeologists excavated several fragments of scrolls from a tomb in Linyi, Shandong province. Sun Bin's Art of War was found among the scrolls. Although ancient texts mention that the original Sun Bin's Art of War was 89 chapters long, the rediscovered copy had 16 verifiable chapters only. As fragments of Sun Tzu's The Art of War were discovered as well, historians believed that some of the chapters might belong to The Art of War instead. The newly discovered text provided historians with a different perspective on the Battle of Guiling and Battle of Maling. In addition, when compared to Sun Tzu's The Art of War, Sun Bin's Art of War contained one major difference from the former. The former advised against siege warfare, while the latter suggested tactics for attacking a besieged city. This paralleled a shift in the strategic consideration of siege warfare during the later stages of the Warring States period. Legacy Sun Bin sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, usually paired with Pang Juan. His rivalry with Pang Juan is portrayed in the 2011 film The Warring States. Sun Bin is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei.

The genus formerly had a much wider range, covering most of the Northern Hemisphere, including the high Arctic in the Paleocene and Eocene. The oldest known fossils are late Cretaceous in age, found in North America. It contributed greatly to the coal swamps of the Cenozoic era. It was reduced to its current range before and during the Pleistocene ice ages.LePage, B.A. 2007. The Taxonomy and Biogeographic History of Glyptostrobus. Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History, 48(2): 359-426. G. pensilis is a medium-sized to large tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to , possibly more. The leaves are deciduous, spirally arranged but twisted at the base to lie in two horizontal ranks, long and broad, but long and scale-like on shoots in the upper crown. The cones are green maturing yellow-brown, pear-shaped, long and diameter, broadest near the apex. They open when mature to release the small, long, winged seeds. It typically grows in river banks, ponds and swamps, growing in water up to deep. Like the related genus Taxodium, it produces 'cypress knees' when growing in water, thought to help transport oxygen to the roots. The species is nearly extinct in the wild due to overcutting for its valuable decay-resistant, scented wood, but it is also fairly widely planted along the banks of rice paddies where its roots help to stabilise the banks by reducing soil erosion.

A utility player who played first base, catcher, and third base, Wooten compiled a .272 batting average with 18 home runs and 86 RBI in 266 games played in his major league career. A member of the Angels' 2002 World Series championship team, he was a late bloomer, not making the majors until age 28. After that, while he played well in limited playing time, his career was derailed by a pair of injuries.  Playing career  = Early career = Wooten was originally drafted and signed by the Detroit Tigers in 1993 as a third baseman. He played a little over two years in the Tigers organization, but was released in midseason in 1995 after batting .129 in 20 games with Double-A Jacksonville. He signed with the independent Moose Jaw Diamond Dogs of the Prairie League, where he hit .373 over the second half of 1995. After playing for Moose Jaw again in 1996, he was signed by the Anaheim Angels for the 1997 season. = Anaheim Angels =  Climbing the ladder  The Angels assigned Wooten to the Class-A Cedar Rapids Kernels, where he began learning the catcher position. In 1998, with the Lake Elsinore Storm, he was the club's starting first baseman, and over the next two seasons Wooten continued to play all three positions. In 2000, he batted .353 with the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers, earning a late-season promotion to the major leagues. He made his major league debut on August 19 as the starting catcher against the New York Yankees and was hitless in four at- bats. His first hit was a single to left field against Kelvim Escobar of the Toronto Blue Jays on August 30. He wound up playing in 7 games, getting five hits in nine at bats.  Rookie season  In 2001, Wooten spent his first full season in the major leagues with Anaheim (qualifying as a rookie) after making the 25-man roster out of spring training. He opened the campaign batting .385 (10-for-26), with three home runs and six runs batted in in April, leading all American League rookies in home runs for the month. His first homer was hit off Mark Mulder of the Oakland Athletics on April 16. In June, he led Angels hitters with a .386 average (17-for-44) and was batting .328 (42-for-128) at the All-Star break, second to Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki among AL rookies (based on 125 at bats). Wooten hit safely in 47 contests, including 17 multi-hit games. His season ended when doctors discovered torn cartilage in his left wrist in early September and he underwent arthroscopic surgery. At the time, he was hitting .312 (69-for-221) with eight home runs and 32 runs batted in in 79 games and ranked second among American League first-year players with a .466 slugging percentage. Nevertheless, he was selected for the Baseball Digest and Topps Major League Baseball rookie All- Star teams. At the time of the injury, his .312 average was second best among American League rookies and was tops on the Angels' club.2001 Anaheim Angels Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics He wound up starting the most games (27) at designated hitter, but also played 25 games at catcher and 21 at first base.  2002  After starting the 2002 season in the minor leagues on a rehab assignment, Wooten came off the disabled list in July 2002. He played in 49 of the team's last 76 games, batting .338 (26-for-77) from August through September, including three doubles in a game to tie a team record. Overall, he finished with a .292 average in 49 games, mostly as a DH or first baseman. In the 2002 postseason, Wooten was used as the club's DH against left-handed pitching, platooning with Brad Fullmer. In the 2002 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, Wooten started two of the four games at DH and pinch-hit in a third. He had six hits in nine at-bats, including a game-tying home run off David Wells in the fifth inning of Game 4, which the Angels went on to win to finish off the series. In the ALCS against the Minnesota Twins, Wooten started one game and played in two others, going 2-for-8 with one RBI. In the World Series against the San Francisco Giants, who did not start any left-handers, he appeared in three games, going 1-for-2. Overall, he hit .474 (9-for-19) with one home run, three RBI and five runs scored in nine postseason games, third best among all hitters in the playoffs.  2003  In 2003, Wooten posted career highs in games (98), at bats (272), runs (25) and walks (24), hitting .243 with seven home runs and 32 RBI. Anaheim pitchers posted a 3.81 ERA with him behind the plate. After a knee injury, Wooten was used mainly as a pinch hitter. His .350 pinch-average (7-for-20) tied for second in the American League. = Philadelphia Phillies = Wooten became a free agent after the 2003 season, and signed with the Philadelphia Phillies before the 2004 season. He was used mostly as a pinch hitter and backup to starting first baseman Jim Thome. However, he batted just .184 and was sent to the minor leagues in July, returning when the rosters expanded in September. He became a free agent again after the season. =Boston Red Sox= The Boston Red Sox signed Wooten to a minor league contract before the 2005 season and assigned him to the Pawtucket Red Sox. On May 19, 2005, the Red Sox placed reserve catcher Doug Mirabelli on the 15-day DL prior to the interleague series opener with the Atlanta Braves, and the Red Sox purchased the contract of Wooten to replace him. At this time, Wooten had seven home runs and 27 RBI in 39 games for Pawtucket and was hitting .225 (34-for-151) when he got the call. He appeared in just one game, replacing Jason Varitek in the late innings of a blowout against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 26, before returning to the minor leagues for the rest of the season. It turned out to be his last major league appearance. =Later career= He signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins at the beginning of the 2006 season and played for their Triple-A affiliate, the Rochester Red Wings, batting .253. He then signed with the San Diego Padres in 2007, where he began the year with the San Antonio Missions, their Double-A affiliate. He was released on July 17, then played in three games with the non-affiliated St. Paul Saints before the New York Mets bought out his contract. He was released by the Mets on May 3, 2008, and quickly re-signed with the Padres. He became a free agent at the end of the season, but went unsigned to end his playing career.  Post-playing career  After his playing career ended, Wooten joined the Padres organization as an instructor. In 2010, he served as hitting coach of the short-season Eugene Emeralds.TinCaps Name Wooten New Manager He managed the Class-A Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Midwest League in 2011. On November 10, 2011 he was hired as manager of the Lake Elsinore Storm of the California League, the Class-A Advanced affiliate of the Padres. He remained with the Storm through the 2013 season and then was hired as hitting coach for the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts in the Dodgers organization. In 2015 the Dodgers switched their Double-A affiliation to the Tulsa Drillers and he remained the hitting coach for them. He was promoted to hitting coach for the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers of the Pacific Coast League in 2016. He left his position with the Dodgers after the 2017 season. Wooten was employed by the Los Angeles Angels as a minor league hitting director in 2017. In the offseason, Wooten operates a baseball academy for young kids to high schoolers (and sometimes working with college players) in Plymouth, Minnesota. Following his minor league job, Wooten was promoted to the position of Assistant Major League Hitting Coach for the Los Angeles Angels prior to the 2019 season.

The Act was first passed by the House in June 1984 (375‚Äì32) but failed to pass in either chamber after divisions occurred within the civil rights coalition over the issue of abortion. In January 1988, the Senate accepted an amendment by Senator John Danforth (R-MO), which added \\"abortion-neutral\\" language to the Bill, a move opposed by the National Organization for Women but resulted in passage of the bill in both houses. The final vote in the Senate on January 28, 1988 was 75‚Äì14 (48‚Äì0 in the Senate Democratic Caucus and 27‚Äì14 in the Senate Republican Conference) with 11 members voting present or abstaining, while the final vote in the House of Representatives on March 2, 1988 was 315‚Äì98 (242‚Äì4 in the House Democratic Caucus and 73‚Äì94 in the House Republican Conference) with 20 members voting present or abstaining. On March 16, 1988, President Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill, as he had promised to do. On March 22, 1988, the Senate overrode Reagan's veto by a vote of 73‚Äì24 (52‚Äì0 in the Senate Democratic Caucus and 21‚Äì24 in the Senate Republican Conference) with 3 members voting present or abstaining, with the House concurring on the same day by a vote of 292‚Äì133 (240‚Äì10 in the House Democratic Caucus and 52‚Äì123 in the House Republican Conference) with 7 members voting present or abstaining. Reagan's veto was the first veto of a civil rights act since Andrew Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The passage of this bill thus overturned the US Supreme Court's 1984 decision in Grove City College v. Bell. It applies to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 15, 2000. In the episode, a man from the future wants Cartman's new Trapper Keeper, while Mr. Garrison's kindergarten class holds an election for class president with confusing results. The Trapper Keeper storyline is an allusion to the Terminator films as well as the anime movie Akira. The subplot with the class president election is a parody of the 2000 United States presidential election and the controversy surrounding its outcome. Plot While waiting for the school bus, Kyle shows his friends his new Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper. He is joined by Cartman who reveals he has a special, advanced Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura S 2000, which has incredibly advanced computerized features including a television, a music player with voice recognition, OnStar and the ability to automatically hybridize itself to any electronic peripheral device. Kyle accuses Cartman of having purchased it to make him envious. On the bus, a mysterious white man calling himself \\"Bill Cosby\\" asks about Cartman's Trapper Keeper, which the man then attempts to steal. He succeeds by buying Cartman's trust, despite Cartman saying \\"I'm not supposed to have male friends over 30; I kinda got screwed over on that once.\\" When \\"Bill Cosby\\" is caught by Officer Barbrady and Cartman, he explains his actions: the Trapper Keeper binder is destined to gain sentience and hybridize into a supercomputer to conquer the world in the future, and wipe out all traces of humanity. Cosby himself is a cyborg from the future named BSM-471, sent back in time to destroy the binder before it could rise to power; Cosby manages to destroy it, but Cartman buys another one and refuses to allow it to be destroyed. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison has been demoted to a kindergarten teacher, and his class holds an election for class president. Kyle's brother Ike has been admitted to kindergarten two years early because of his supposed intelligence (despite not being able to speak properly). Ike is chosen by Mr. Garrison to run against a boy named Filmore, resulting in a tie that is broken by the vote of a little girl named Flora. At first, Flora can't decide whom to pick. After she picks Ike, Filmore's side demands recounts and then involves Rosie O'Donnell, who comes to protest that Filmore (her nephew) has not won. While this is happening, Stan, Kyle and Kenny accompany their robotic companion to Cartman's house to convince his mother to help them, but she goes off with Bill Cosby to have sex. Meanwhile, Cartman's Trapper Keeper integrates itself into Cartman's computer and most of his belongings, and then absorbs Cartman himself. Cartman is transformed into a giant, cybernetic blobby monster that retains most of Cartman's features, similar in style and execution to the movie Akira. It kills Kenny and destroys the house, and sets off to Cheyenne Mountain to absorb the secret military base's computer. Bill Cosby warns that if the Trapper Keeper assimilates with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain, it will become unstoppable. Kyle sneaks into the huge Cartman-Trapper Keeper hybrid through a ventilation pipe; but before he can disable it, the Trapper Keeper incapacitates him. Rosie O'Donnell appears in front of the Trapper Keeper and yells at it for blocking the road. The Trapper Keeper then absorbs her, but fusing with her ultimately makes the behemoth sick. Kyle is freed and disconnects the Trapper Keeper's CPU, and the beast returns to its powerless state. The destruction of the Trapper Keeper causes Bill Cosby to disappear, and Stan tells Cartman to thank Kyle, who just saved his life. Cartman starts to thank Kyle just as the episode ends, but the credits roll before he can finish and cuts him off at \\"Kyle...\\" As for the kindergarteners, after countless lawyers come in and legal forms and endless meetings, Filmore concedes because \\"this game is stupid\\". With Ike as president, the kids decide to go fingerpaint, much to Mr. Garrison's delight. Development =Background= The episode is a parody of the controversy surrounding the 2000 United States presidential election on November 7, 2000. State results tallied on election night gave 246 electoral votes to Republican candidate George W. Bush and 255 to Democratic nominee Al Gore, with New Mexico (5), Oregon (7), and Florida (25) too close to call that evening. Mathematically, Florida's 25 electoral votes became the key to an election win, while both New Mexico and Oregon were called in favor of Gore over the next few days. After an intense recount process, Bush was officially declared the winner of Florida's electoral votes and as a result, the entire presidential election. There was disagreement over who won Florida's 25 electoral votes, the vote recount, and the uncommon situation that the winner received fewer popular votes than the loser. =Production= Trey Parker wrote the episode \\"Trapper Keeper\\" was written by South Park co-creator Trey Parker when he, Matt Stone, and a group of friends visited Lake Powell. It is one of the many South Park episodes that parodies a current event. The main plot of the episode involving the Trapper Keeper was written before the election, but the subplot is a parody of the controversy surrounding the election's outcome. \\"Trapper Keeper\\" did not originally feature the election storyline, only a subplot about Ike attending his first day of kindergarten. Parker and Stone said the presidential election controversy was \\"kids' stuff,\\" and that is what they were trying to show with the episode. Stone commented that \\"it makes perfect sense because everything is just so childish anyway, the way people are acting about the election and the way candidates are. Usually you try to satirize something by taking it to the extreme. But it was actually kind of hard to satirize because it's just so stupid you can't even take it to an extreme.\\" Anne Garefino, executive producer of South Park, said that when they applied the presidential election process to kindergarten, it \\"finally [made] sense.\\" Stone added that the storyline \\"kind of wrote itself. When you put this same situation in with kindergartners, everyone's actions kind of make a lot more sense.\\" The voices of the kindergarteners were provided by actual children, including the son of one of the producers on the show. Parker and Stone said they had fun recording the kindergarten scenes, because \\"instead of adults doing the voices of the kids, it was so funny to hear a little kid actually doing it.\\" The episode was completed at approximately nine in the morning on the day it aired, November 15, 2000, only days after the election was over. Parker and Stone worked with a team of 70 animators and computer engineers to get the episode finished in time. Cultural references The main plot of \\"Trapper Keeper\\" is a parody of the Terminator films. The episode also features references to 2001: A Space Odyssey and Akira. The Trapper Keeper's ability to take on the physical forms of the various things it has consumed is a reference to the eponymous entity in the 1958 version of the movie The Blob. The New York Posts Andrea Peyser analyzed the episode's references to the 2000 United States presidential election. She commented that in \\"Trapper Keeper\\", the election of class president ends in a deadlock, while in Florida, the election for president was \\"hopelessly deadlocked.\\" She went on to say that in South Park, the school \\"rousts a sick kid from his hospital bed\\" to vote by absentee ballot, and in Florida, \\"officials roust people from the cemetery to vote by absentee ballot.\\" Peyser added that Rosie O'Donnell appears in \\"Trapper Keeper\\" and plans to gather lawyers, media and her friends to \\"help settle the race the way she sees fit,\\" while in Florida, O'Donnell, Harvey Weinstein, Gloria Steinem, Bianca Jagger \\"and other celebrities signed a petition demanding a revote in Palm Beach County, ensuring the race would go to Gore.\\" One of the kindergarteners is named Flora, referencing the state Florida that was undecided in the election. Reception Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger reviewed the episode as \\"terrific, especially the vote for kindergarten class president, and the recount-recount-recount bit.\\" Sepinwall added that he was \\"pretty amazed myself that the South Park guys were able to put together such a sharp election satire so quickly. I called up Comedy Central and found out that they do all the animation in-house on computers that allow them to work much faster than shows like The Simpsons, which contract out all the animation to firms in Korea that take months to complete an episode.\\" Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict described \\"Trapper Keeper\\" as \\"a clever attack on the entire Florida voting debacle in the 2000 election‚Äîthe show's take on the entire childish nature of the fighting is fantastic. As a Terminator knock-off 'Trapper Keeper' is a lot of fun. But adding in the political element really increases the deliciously derogatory tone.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson characterized \\"Trapper Keeper\\" as \\"a clever riff\\" on Terminator and the controversy of the 2000 election. He thought both plots \\"work really well, as the show tosses in lots of cool little moments. ... It's funny and smart, and a good [episode].\\" IGN's David Galindo called the episode \\"great,\\" and Fort Worth Star-Telegrams Lisa Davis named Mr. Garrison's line \\"You're all acting like a bunch of kids!\\" the \\"best line of the week.\\" \\"Trapper Keeper\\" originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 15, 2000. Though a rerun of the episode aired in the middle of the night on WPIX because of offensive content, a The Star-Ledger critic did not think it was \\"that dirty to begin with.\\" The episode was included in the UMD South Park: When Technology Attacks that was released on October 11, 2005 for the PlayStation Portable.

Life Poelzig was born in Berlin in 1869 to Countess Clara Henrietta Maria Poelzig (daughter of Alexander von Hanstein, Count of P√∂lzig and Beiersdorf) while she was married to George Acland Ames, an Englishman. Uncertain of his paternity, Ames refused to acknowledge Hans as his son and consequently he was brought up by a local choirmaster and his wife. In 1899 he married Maria Voss with whom they had four children.Dawson, p.96 Hans Poelzig was buried in the Old Cemetery in Berlin-Wannsee. On 18 November 2015, Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin inaugurated a memorial at Friedrichstra√üe 107 dedicated to the theatre's founders, Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig and Erik Charell. =Education= In 1903 he became a teacher and director at the Breslau Academy of Art and Design (Kunst- und Gewerbeschule Breslau; today Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). From 1920-1935 he taught at the Technical University of Berlin (Technische Hochschule Berlin). Director of the Architecture Department of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. =Career= After finishing his architectural education around the turn of the century, Poelzig designed many industrial buildings. He designed the 51.2 m tall Upper Silesia Tower in Posen (today Pozna≈Ñ) for an industrial fair in 1911. It later became a water tower. He was appointed city architect of Dresden in 1916. He was an influential member of the Deutscher Werkbund. Poelzig was also known for his distinctive 1919 interior redesign of the Berlin Grosses Schauspielhaus for Weimar impresario Max Reinhardt, and for his vast architectural set designs for the 1920 UFA film production of The Golem: How He Came Into the World. (Poelzig mentored Edgar Ulmer on that film; when Ulmer directed the 1934 film noir Universal Studios production of The Black Cat, he returned the favor by naming the architect-Satanic-high-priest villain character \\"Hjalmar Poelzig\\", played by Boris Karloff.) With his Weimar architect contemporaries like Bruno Taut and Ernst May, Poelzig's work developed through Expressionism and the New Objectivity in the mid-1920s before arriving at a more conventional, economical style. In 1927 he was one of the exhibitors in the first International Style project, the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart. In the 1920s he ran the \\"Studio Poelzig\\" in partnership with his wife Marlene (Nee Moeschke) (1894‚Äì1985). Poelzig also designed the 1929 Broadcasting House in the Berlin suburb of Charlottenburg, a landmark of architecture, and Cold War and engineering history. 1912 Department Store, Wroc≈Çaw South facade of the 1931 Poelzig Building at Goethe University, Frankfurt a. M. Poelzig's single best-known building is the enormous and legendary I.G. Farben Building, completed in 1931 as the administration building for IG Farben in Frankfurt am Main, now known as the Poelzig Building at Goethe University. In March 1945 the building was occupied by American Allied forces under Eisenhower, became his headquarters, and remained in American hands until 1995. Some of his designs that were never built included one for the Palace of the Soviets and one for the League of Nations headquarters at Geneva. In 1933 Poelzig served as the interim director of the Vereinigte Staatsschulen f√ºr freie und angewandete Kunst (United State School for Fine and Applied Art), after the expulsion of founding director Bruno Paul by the National Socialists. Poelzig died in Berlin in June 1936, shortly before his planned departure for Ankara.

According to the testimony of one of the survivors of the incident, a 14-year-old Hindu boy named Vinod Kuman Dhar, the gunmen came to their house dressed like Indian Army soldiers, had tea with them, waiting for a radio message indicating that all Hindu families in the village had been covered.

It is sited on a ridge between two rivers. As archaeological excavations near the village centre have found a significant neolithic settlement provisionally dated to around 3500BC, as well as medieval structures, scholars have suggested that Dreghorn could be Britain's oldest continuously inhabited village. Both Irvine and Dreghorn have grown in size and they are now separated by the Annick Valley Park, which incorporates a footpath and National Cycle Route 73 on the route of the disused Irvine to Busby railway line. The Church of Scotland Dreghorn and Springside Parish Church, at the centre of the village, dates from 1780. Its octagonal plan which is unusual in Scotland was produced by the church's principal benefactor, Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton. The village's most famous inhabitant, John Boyd Dunlop, was born at a Dreghorn farm in 1840. When practicing as a veterinary surgeon in Belfast, in 1887 he invented pneumatic tyres for bicycles. Location Main Street, looking east along the B7081 from the B730 crossroads The village of Dreghorn lies east of the centre of Irvine, North Ayrshire, on a ridge between Annick Water to its immediate north, and the River Irvine further to the south. The old main road from Irvine to Kilmarnock (now the B7081) formed the original village street along the ridge. As Townfoot, it rises to the high point of the ridge at the Parish Church in the centre of the village, then continues as Main Street east along the ridge, down to the nearby village of Springside which is also in Dreghorn Parish. Ridge seen across Annick Valley Park and the Annick Water The Annick Water runs close to the north of the village, along the edge of the Annick Valley Park. Woodland and open green spaces, including playing fields, separate Dreghorn from Irvine New Town, with the district of Broomlands adjoining the park. The disused Irvine to Busby railway line, which runs along this park, has been converted to a footpath, and forms National Cycle Route 73 as part of the Irvine New Town Trail. Holmsford Bridge which replaced a fording point of the River Irvine, looking south along the B730 towards Drybridge. At a crossroads immediately to the east of the church, Station Brae runs north down the hill to the former Dreghorn railway station, and the B730 runs south towards Drybridge, crossing the River Irvine at Holmsford Bridge. Here it crosses under the A71 road, which runs as a modern bypass along the Irvine Valley to the south of the village. A link from the B730 joins the A71 at a roundabout at Corsehill, providing expressway access from Dreghorn to Irvine town centre, and eastwards to Kilmarnock. History Dreghorn was the site of a significant neolithic settlement, and subsequently a medieval village: archaeological evidence has been provisionally dated to around 3500BC, suggesting that Dreghorn could be Britain's oldest continuously inhabited village. In advance of a development of new housing to the north of properties on the current Main Street, preliminary testing found features including an ancient well. The excavations were carried out between November 2003 and April 2004 at a site on the slope from the ridge down towards Annick Water. The housing development has since been completed, as Station Brae Gardens. Neolithic features included pits and post holes with remains including fragments of some Early Neolithic carinated bowls and larger amounts of Late Neolithic Grooved ware. Stone items were made from local and imported materials including flint, Arran pitchstone and chert, and included scrapers, arrowheads and cutting tools. A memorial plaque to John Boyd Dunlop at Dreghorn village hall. Three parallel rows of post holes indicated a rectangular structure by , probably a timber hall similar to the Neolithic long house found at Balbridie. Smaller post holes and stake holes define eight to twelve round or oval structures, possibly round houses, as well as six gully-defined structures with numerous stake-holes. A large oval feature, approximately by , contained heavily retired pottery shards and is thought likely to have been a kiln. Possible ritualistic landscape features include a massive post-pit and post holes or pits forming arcs. At the west edge of the site, adjacent to Station Brae, part of a probable palisade was found. Medieval finds included a trackway, ditches, pits and remains of numerous structures including kilns and a diameter wattle and daub walled granary. John Boyd Dunlop was born at a Dreghorn farm on 5 February 1840. He qualified as a veterinary surgeon at the Dick Vet in Edinburgh and set up practice in Belfast, where he also invented a pneumatic tyres for bicycles in October 1887. The principle had been patented by Robert William Thomson in 1847, but it was Dunlop's invention that made a success of the idea. =Maid Morville's mound= Maid Morville's mound was located to the east of the B730, just north of Holmsford Bridge before it crosses the River Irvine. The name commemorated the tragic drowning of a member of the de Morville family, who were the overlords of the baillerie of Cunninghame. The mound was destroyed by construction of the earthworks of the expressway. 'Maid Morville Avenue' still exists to commemorate the event. Locally the mound was known as 'Marble Hill', a corruption of 'Morville's Hill'. There is also a 'Marble Avenue' nearby. View south up Station Brae over Dreghorn Bridge across the Annick Water to the Parish Church, with NCR73 sign at the site of the station. =Railway Station= Dreghorn Station, at the foot of Station Brae by the River Annick, provided access to rail services between Irvine and Kilmarnock. It closed in 1964 and the railway is now a public footpath and woodland. The Churches Excavations of the Neolithic site suggest ritualistic features, and early Christians including the Culdees often took over pagan religious sites for their churches. Saint Brendan influenced the area in the 6th century. It seems that relics of his fellow monk Barrintus were venerated at Dreghorn church, though this could date from a much later period. When Kilwinning Abbey was established around 1171, fourteen parishes including Dreghorn came under its control. One of the monks would have been given charge of Dreghorn parish and the church lands. =Dreghorn and Springside Parish Church= The unusual octagonal Kirk of Dreghorn The Church of Scotland parish church at the top of Station Brae, dating from 1780, has an unusual octagonal plan. At one time, the church was known locally as the \\"Threepenny\\" after the 12-sided Threepence coin. Following the Scottish Reformation, maintenance of the small rectangular church, the manse and churchyard, as well as payment of the minister's stipend, was vested in local landowners, the Heritors of the Parish. After years of complaints over repairs, in February 1777 the minister, Mr Tod. petitioned the Presbytery in Irvine that \\"a visitation be made with assistance of skilled tradesmen that the church (in Dreghorn) be pulled down and a new one built\\" on the same site. The Presbytery agreed in March 1777, then in 1779 they petitioned the principal Heritor, and patron of the church, Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton, to \\"give in a plan of a New Kirk\\". The heritors agreed in March 1780 to commence building work on the basis of his plan, in the shape of an octagon: he may have seen similar churches during his recent years spent in Europe. Built as a school in 1774 the small building on the right of the entrance to the churchyard was in the 19th century used as a morthouse and a mortuary, with a room for each, later becoming the kirk session house. When the Parishes of Dreghorn and Perceton were united, Dreghorn and Perceton church owned the land surrounding the church (called 'The Glebe'). A current circular cul-de-sac called The Glebe commemorates this fact.The Statistical Account of Scotland, Volume 4 by Sir John Sinclair, Bart. The kirk is now called Dreghorn and Springside Parish Church. =Perceton and Dreghorn Free Church= In the Disruption of 1843, the Free Church of Scotland broke away. The entry for Dreghorn in Groome's Ordnance Gazetteer for 1882-4 describes the village as having \\"a Free Church mission station and an Evangelical Union chapel; and Dreghorn Free church is at Perceton village.\\" Perceton and Dreghorn Free Church, at the east end of Main Street in Dreghorn, was built in 1877 for ¬£4,000. It later became the Church of Scotland's Perceton and Dreghorn Parish Church, but eventually congregation numbers fell, so the parishes merged and the church closed in 1992. A Threatened Building Survey recorded photographs of the building in 1996. The Sun Life Corporation of Japan bought the building for ¬£50,000. In 1996 they demolished it carefully and shipped the materials to Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, for reconstruction, at a cost of ¬£250,000. This included the pulpit and church organ, and every block of masonry was numbered for rebuilding. The Hotel Sunlife Garden wedding complex, incorporating the reconstructed church as its central feature, was opened with a ceremony on 2 July 1999. Employment Dreghorn's historical main industries were farming and coal mining. All of the coal mines around Dreghorn were closed by the early 1980s. Dreghorn is still surrounded on two sides by farm land. The new communities of Broomlands and Bourtreehill cover the sites of some former mines. Dreghorn Primary School, on Main Street, had a school roll of 270 pupils in 2013, with 21 teachers. Greenwood Academy secondary school at the west end of the village serves several areas of Irvine as well as Dreghorn. In September 2013, its school roll was 1494 pupils, and it had 113 teachers.

The experiment which was established in 1979 is located near Manaus in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The project is jointly managed by the Amazon Biodiversity Center and the Brazilian Institute for Research in the Amazon (INPA). The project was initiated in 1979 by Thomas Lovejoy to investigate the SLOSS debate. Initially named the Minimum Critical Size of Ecosystems Project,Quammen, p. 454 the project created forest fragments of sizes , , and . Data were collected prior to the creation of the fragments and studies of the effects of fragmentation now exceed 25 years. As of April 2020, 785 scholarly journal articles and more than 150 graduate dissertations and theses had emerged from the project. History The Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), was born out of the SLOSS (single large or several small reserves of equal area) debate in the mid - 1970s about the application of the theory of island biogeography to conservation planning. The debate determined that the species richness and the rate of growth increase as the area of a reserve increases. It also determined that the shape of a reserve is very important to the species diversity. Reserves with a large surface area to volume ratio tend to be affected more by edge effects than reserves with a small surface area to volume ratio. The distance between reserves and the habitat surrounding the reserves (the matrix) can affect species richness and diversity as well. Despite the seeming logic of these ideas, ecologists questioned the results of the SLOSS debate due to the lack of a critical body of evidence on the subject. Many ecologists began to conduct studies and experiments on fragmented ecosystems to fill this gap, including Tom Lovejoy, who designed a large-scale experiment that studied the effects of different sizes of fragmentation to animals, plants, and ecological processes. Lovejoy‚Äôs objective throughout the experiment was to gain insight on the effects of habitat fragmentation on species in tropical rainforests. He called it the Minimum Critical Size of Ecosystems Project (the name was later changed to the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project). In 1979, the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA) endorsed Lovejoy‚Äôs experiment. Later, Lovejoy teamed up with Robert Bierregaard to assist him with the project by assigning him the responsibility of conducting all of the fieldwork. The two ecologists started the project in rainforests on the outskirts of Manaus, Brazil. The BDFFP is a collaborative project between the Brazilian National Institute for Amazonian Research and the Smithsonian Institution. The BDFFP would become one of the most important studies of fragmentation in tropical forests because it is the only long running study with data before fragments were created with the original data being from the continuous forest.  Project development and hypothesis  The study of habitat fragmentation found its roots early, with Aldo Leopold‚Äôs ideas on edge effect and Alfred Russel Wallace‚Äôs and E. O. Wilson‚Äôs studies and models of island biogeography laying a foundation for the field (Laurance and Bierregaard 1997). These concepts offer potential applicable and hypothetico-deductive value for the study of forest fragmentation and have inspired debates about habitat reserve design. Generally speaking, the theory of island biogeography represents a collection of interwoven ideas (Harris 1984), describing patterns of floral and faunal communities on marine islands. It models fundamental processes such as dispersal, diversity and population dynamics of islands with regards to their area and distance from other islands or the mainland. Theoretically, forest fragments take on the characteristics of habitat islands in proportion to their degree of and length of time of isolation (Harris 1984). Island biogeography theory and lessons learned from true-island biogeography provide a basis for developing a management strategy and addressing specific decision variables, such as reserve patch size, distribution, placement and protective measures (Harris 1984). Nevertheless, a notable difference between oceanic islands and terrestrial islands, or fragments, is the existence of land surrounding or between the fragments, referred to as the matrix. The impacts of use and management of this space is a continued subject of study. Observations of edge effects on habitats are also important, if not integral, to the study of fragmentation effects. A slew of changes in habitat and trophic interactions have been observed to magnify as distance from habitat edge decreases, such as nest predation, decreased humidity and soil moisture, sunlight, decreased species richness and changes in species constitution. The degree of these impacts on fragments continues to be studied. Due to the generally high ratio of edge to habitat area in fragments, edges are presumed to have detrimental consequences for the organisms that inhabit forest fragments. These concepts have largely inspired the SLOSS (single large or several small) reserve size debate, which the Minimal Critical Size of Ecosystem Project (now known as the BDFFP) attempts to address. The SLOSS debate is an ongoing interdisciplinary discussion in which the scientific community attempts to understand and weigh the pros and cons of different reserve size and distribution, for successful ecosystem conservation: single large reserve, or several small ones? Increasing and widespread habitat loss and fragmentation, along with the SLOSS debate, have led to the questions the BDFFP originally sought to answer. Overall, Lovejoy‚Äôs goal in establishing the project was to determine necessary reserve size and placement for successful habitat and species conservation, hence the original name of the project. According to Bierregaard's book, Lessons from Amazonia, Lovejoy worked off of the Island Biogeography Theory and asked three key questions: # What effect does fragment size have on the rate of species extinction? # Would the local extinction rate eventually slow and halt, equalizing the number of species? # How do species interactions and demography change as a result of reduced habitat? Since then, studies conducted on the BDFFP site have varied enormously in terms of their principal goals and hypotheses (Laurance and Bierregaard 1997). Along with reserve size, placement and distribution, it is also important to understand and properly manage the links between habitat fragmentation and ecosystem persistence (Bierregaard 2001). Studies on edge effects, extinction rates, biotic and abiotic interactions, mortality factors, soil quality and more performed on this site address fragmentation effects on biodiversity and other ecological changes. Other dimensions influencing ecosystems are also studied, such as economic and human factors. Many studies in BDFFP also attempt to find ways to apply research to restoration, conservation and management practices of tropical forests. The original core question of minimum ecosystem reserve size has initiated an incredible variety of research that continues to grow and diversify.  Study area  The BDFFP spans approximately 1,000 km¬≤ of the Brazilian Amazon region located 70 km north of Manaus, Brazil in South America. This particular area of South America is famous for its tropical forests and climate, as well as high levels of wildlife diversity. The BDFFP Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, which contains the study areas, is divided between the municipalities of Manaus (3.61%) and Rio Preto da Eva (96.39%). It has a total area of . The research area is about north of the city of Manaus. On average, the Amazon Basin ranges from 1,900 to 2,500 millimeters of rainfall annually, while the mean annual temperature is 26 ¬∞C with a prominent dry season from June through October. Another distinct feature of the forests in the BDFFP is the canopy, which can reach from 30 to 37 meters with some emergents reaching up to 55 meters. These forests, dominated primarily by palms in the understory, are home to over 1200 species of trees in at least 64 families. The BDFFP reserves are found in non- flooded tropical lowland rainforest where soils are nutrient-poor and the topography ranges from 50 to 150 m in elevation. Although the area is relatively flat, it includes three large cattle ranges and contains 11 forest fragments, ranging from 1-100 hectares, surrounded by continuous forest that acts as an experimental controls (Laurance 2011). For detailed images of the study area, visit the INPA maps In the early 1980s, clearing and burning led to fragment isolation of about 80 ‚Äì 650 meters from the surrounding intact forest, a procedure that was continued several times throughout the experiment due to successful regrowth of secondary forests (Laurance 2011). The final reserve isolation took place in 1990 with the successful felling and burning of a 200-meter-wide strip around the Dimona reserve. An important characteristic of the diversity of the Amazon Basin is that many species are rare or distributed erratically throughout the Amazonian forest. This introduces an phenomenon known as the \\"sample effect\\", which suggests that the absence of species from the experimental fragments may be due to the fact that they were not present during fragment creation rather than from vanishment (Laurance 2011). This effect is essential to understanding the effects of forest fragmentation because small fragments cannot sustain large populations due to competition for resources and habitat loss. Therefore, in the experiment, it is unlikely that species not present at the beginning of the experiment will appear in these smaller fragments. Some organisms, however, remain stable and even favor disturbed areas. Leaf bryophytes, wandering spiders and frogs are among the species that remain stable while gap-favoring species include hummingbirds, butterflies, and lianas. Because the matrix surrounding isolated fragments is not completely inhospitable to some species, it is important to understanding how native wildlife can use these human- altered habitats as corridors for dispersal or reproduction.  Example studies  There has been a broad scope of studies performed on the BDFFP site focusing on many elements of fragmentation effects on organisms and habitat conditions. Subjects from a range of biota are studied, including trees and other flora, microorganisms, and a variety vertebrate and invertebrates. Soil chemistry and development, as well as human and environmental factors in fragments have also been researched. Some notable studies performed on the BDFFP site are summarized below. =Edge effects= Edge effects is a general term for the impacts of different habitats at or near the barrier where they meet, the \\"edge\\". They are an important factor in many habitats, especially when it comes to fragmented habitats, and are studied extensively in the field. One major study performed on this subject was \\"Edge-related changes in environment and plant responses due to forest fragmentation in central Amazonia\\" by Valerie Kapos, Elisa Wandelli, Jose Luis Camargo, and Gislene Ganade. The following was summarized from pages 33 to 44 of Tropical Forest Remnants: Ecology, Management and Conservation of Fragmented Communities by W.F. Laurance and R.O. Bierregaard. A major change brought about by habitat fragmentation is an increase in the proportion of edge exposed to other habitats, and the importance of this change depends to a degree on the contrast between the fragmented habitat and the matrix in which it occurs. Edge effects play an important role in the regional environment as well, with the Amazon forests helping maintain hydrological cycles through their roles in evapotranspiration and soil protection. Depending on the extent to which the influence of desiccating edge-effect conditions from the clearings (matrix) penetrates into the forest and on how plants respond to it, forest fragments might be expected to evapotranspire more than equivalent areas of continuous forest. Therefore, this research focused on assessing the edge related gradients of factors that affect evapotranspiration in forest fragments, and plant responses to them. Changes in edge effects with time were also studied. Temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and soil moisture were the factors surveyed. The study compared measurements made at different distances along transects from the western isolated edge toward the center of the reserve with measurements made in control areas more than 500m from the forest edge. Understory plant/water relations were monitored in dry seasons, soil moisture measurements were made over ten months, understory plant distributions were measured, microclimatic and leaf expansion studies were done, as well as vegetation structure studies, all between 1988 and 1990. In both wet and dry seasons, soil moisture in the edge transects was similar to that in the control areas except at the edge itself and in the region between 40 and 80 m from edge. Soil water potentials below wilting point occurred in the forest during dry season, but the driest points were not necessarily near the edge and no evidence of prolonged drought was found. Thus, any edge drought effects on plants must be due to combined effects of reduced soil moisture and higher atmospheric demand exceeding the supplying power of vascular systems, rather ecosystem-level water shortage. Plant responses: For leaf expansion in Duguetia, there was no difference in the rate of leaf expansion between plants in edge zones and those in control areas. When looking at whether canopy trees close their stomata to reduce water loss as a response to the changed environment, they found no difference between these two locations. They looked at the same response in understory plants, and found the results might suggest that the understory species did have greater water use efficiencies near the forest edge. This pattern could be explained by either greater mixing of air from outside the forest with the understory air or lower decomposition rates, or both, near the edge. Vegetation structure was also analyzed. They found clear edge-related gradients in environmental factors gave way to more complex patterns, which suggested some influence of the edge. Although there was little evidence of edge effecting plant water status, distribution of at least one understory species suggests proximity to edge is disadvantageous. Some general implications suggested by this study are edge effects on environmental variables become more complex as edge ages. These complex patterns and plant responses to them are likely strongly influenced by frequent gaps near edges, changing vegetation structure and continuing to alter the nature and extent of edge effects. Management decisions based on edge effects should incorporate understanding of the mechanisms behind those effects, and long term studies are necessary to determine those mechanisms and their changes over time. =Effects on fauna= Many studies have been conducted about the fragmentation effects on vertebrates and invertebrates, including amphibians, insects, mammals and birds. This study, ‚ÄúUnderstory birds and dynamic habitat mosaics in Amazonian rainforests‚Äù by Richard Bierregaard and Philip C. Stouffer is a long term experiment studying birds in a dynamic system of small forests remnants surrounded by pasture or abandoned pasture undergoing secondary succession. The following was summarized from pages 138 to 155 of Tropical Forest Remnants: Ecology, Management and Conservation of Fragmented Communities by W.F. Laurance and R.O. Bierregaard. Within a series of 1 and 10 hectare and one 100 hectare fragments, mark-recapture program was conducted focusing on understory birds to reveal changes in species composition and activity level. Analysis of broadly defined ecological guilds was performed, including nectar feeders, insectivores, and frugivores. They related changes in the fragment avifauna to remnant size, time since isolation, and the nature of the surrounding vegetation. For insectivores, abundance and species richness of most frequently captured birds declined significantly in post- isolation reserves. The obligate army ant-following species disappeared completely from 1 and 10 ha isolates within 2 years of isolation. As with insectivores, frugivores showed significant declines in capture rates after isolation and four species showed effects of time since isolation. Nectarivores, such as understory hummingbirds, proved to be less vulnerable to fragmentation than insectivores and frugivores. Birds play an integral role in tropical rainforest ecosystems and are likely the best studied group of organisms in these forests, so they provide an excellent opportunity to understand faunal responses to habitat fragmentation. This study identified both particularly sensitive and insensitive groups of species. These are first steps in developing understanding needed to minimize effects humans are having on tropical rainforest ecosystems.  Future  What started out as a five- person initiative slowly gained momentum as funding for the BDFFP grew and became a successful midsize research project operated by a larger staff. This growth has allowed for continuous large-scale inventories of species‚Äô response to fragmentation, which is a main focal point of research concerning future conservation. One of the major advantages of this study is that it has been conducted very consistently over a long period of time. Experimentation over several decades allows for the occurrence of natural events, such as El Ni√±o droughts, which are important facilitators of natural disturbance that could affect fragmentation. Much more needs to be understood about forest fragments, however. As BDFFP data suggests, even small fragments can take centuries to stabilize their floristic composition and carbon storage after experiencing dramatic ecological changes (Laurance 2011). The fundamental goals drawn from the BDFFP experiment are to preserve larger areas of land to ensure viable populations are maintained and to maintain the forests‚Äô natural ecological processes. Due to the continuing impacts of deforestation on tropical forest composition and processes, it can be said that the ecological future of the Amazonian region is greatly tied to its economic future. Efforts should continue to be made in order to prevent disastrous edge effects resulting from fires, climate change, and human impact from commercial hunting and logging. Over 30 years of research and data collection with the BDFFP experiment has led to many discoveries and important lessons for scientists, but has also faced many challenges, such as funding. Since the late 1990s, colonization and hunting have emerged as direct threats to the BDFFP. The paving of the 1100-km-long Manaus-Venezuela highway has increased forest colonization and logging (Laurance 2011). As the influx of humans continues into these lands, the conservation efforts of the BDFFP become increasingly important in order to prevent devastating effects on the surrounding forest ecosystems.

History Cowles Broadcasting Company applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a construction permit for a new FM station on 97.5 MHz on October 5, 1945. The FCC granted the permit on June 9, 1946. The permit was modified several times, with the station's frequency changing to 94.5 MHz, then 100.5 MHz, and finally 98.7 MHz. The station was originally assigned the WOL-FM call sign. The FCC granted the station its first license on February 17, 1949. Cowles Broadcasting sold WOL-FM and WOL (1260 AM) to Capital Broadcasting Company on October 3, 1949. At the time, Capital Broadcasting owned WWDC (1450 AM) and WWDC-FM (101.1 FM). The FCC approved the sale on the condition that WWDC's 250-watt signal on 1450 AM would not be upgraded. Capital Broadcasting decided to swap the licenses, call signs and facilities of the two AM stations and the two FM stations. WOL-FM's call sign would be changed to WWDC-FM while its frequency would be changed to 101.1 MHz. Simultaneously, WWDC-FM's call sign would be changed to WOL-FM while the its frequency would be changed to 98.7 MHz. To prepare for these changes, Capital Broadcasting applied to the FCC for a construction permit on January 26, 1950 to change WOL-FM's frequency to 101.1 MHz. The call signs were swapped on the effective date of the sale, February 20, 1950. The FCC granted Capital Broadcasting a new license for the station, with the new call sign, for operation on the new frequency on August 26, 1952. Also on February 20, 1950, the call sign swap for the AM stations took place, with the WWDC call sign now on the more powerful 5-kilowatt 1260 AM facility. Capital Broadcasting then sold WOL 1450 AM to Peoples Broadcasting. Unlike the AM stations, the FM stations were near each other and on equal footing at 20 kilowatts of power. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it simulcast the programming of its (slightly more contemporary than) MOR AM sister station on weekdays, and played oldies at night and on weekends. In the mid-1970s, it attempted album rock at night for a few months and then switched full-time to an album rock music format. Its AM counterpart (now WQOF) was the first American radio station to play a Beatles song when it played \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" in December 1963. WWDC's most successful ratings and revenue period was 1987‚Äì1990. The station was #1 in men (Arbitron) and was a printing press when it came to money. One of the premier album oriented rock stations in the country, the air staff featured Greaseman in the morning, Dusty Scott in midday, Steveski in afternoons and Kirk McEwen in the evening. With this lineup and format, WWDC consistently ran in the 6s, dominating men in the nation's 7th largest market. The sound was a combination of new and classic rock. Other personalities (Boss Jocks) during the 80s included Adam \\"Smash\\" Smasher, Ernie D'Kaye, Cerphe, Sandy Edwards, Buddy Rizer, YDB (Young Dave Brown), Sean Donohue (Rusty Brainpan), and Vinnie Brewster. WWDC's rock playlist typically swings toward the hard rock end of the rock spectrum, playing acts like Foo Fighters and Metallica. Early on, though, pop-oriented acts including Elton John, Billy Joel and Rod Stewart often cropped up on-air. During the 1990s, the station interspersed more modern and alternative rock acts including Smashing Pumpkins and Stone Temple Pilots to compete with its chief rival, WHFS-FM. Originally a mainstream rock station, WWDC changed to their current alternative rock format by 2005 because of WHFS-FM flipping to tropical music as WLZL, but Mediabase & Nielsen BDS had them on the alternative rock panels prior to the WHFS-FM flip. This left the hard rock/active rock playlist for the Washington/Baltimore area to continue on rival WIYY (98 Rock) in Baltimore. In 2007, the station was nominated by Radio & Records for top alternative station in a top-25 market. WWDC was among the last independently owned radio stations in the Washington, D.C. market. In February 1998, parent company Capitol Broadcasting sold WWDC and its AM sister station, WWDC 1260 (now WQOF), for $72 million to Texas-based Chancellor Media, later AM-FM. Eventually, AM-FM was acquired by Clear Channel Communications, which (as iHeartMedia) now owns and operates a total of five radio stations in Washington, D.C. WWDC's facilities were once located on Connecticut Avenue between Dupont Circle and Farragut Square in downtown Washington, D.C. They later moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, and are now located in Rockville, Maryland. By 2011, WWDC added Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd back on the playlist, although they were played sparingly and the station was still not considered active rock. As of August 2014, those artists have been dropped from the playlist. =Shock jock springboard= WWDC advanced the careers of several famous (or notorious) morning radio personalities. Howard Stern was the morning man from March 1981 to June 1982. When Stern left the station on June 29, 1982, it was rumored that he was fired because of his on-air prank of pretending to call Air Florida airlines to book a flight to the 14th Street Bridge only one day after 78 people died when Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the Potomac River at the bridge.Answers.com Nearly six months elapsed between the crash of Air Florida 90 occurred on January 13, 1982, and the firing in late June. It is more likelyMarksFriggin.com ‚Äì Stern Show News ‚Äì Archive that Stern was fired because of an impasse on his compensation, because he had already signed with WNBC before his WWDC contract ended. It is at WWDC that Stern was first paired with news anchor Robin Quivers. WWDC is featured prominently in Stern's 1997 bio-pic Private Parts. Stern was replaced by Doug Tracht, better known as the Greaseman, who spent over ten years at the station, from August 2, 1982 to January 22, 1993, and returned to the station in April 2008, but eventually was laid off again in October 2008 so the station could focus solely on music on weekends without his comedy bits. WWDC's current morning program is Elliot In the Morning, led by Elliot Segal. Since beginning his tenure at WWDC in 1999, Segal has been suspended and fined on several occasions for the show's sometimes controversial content; in October 2003, Clear Channel was fined $55,000 for the broadcast of indecent material during two episodes of the program in May 2002. In the first of the two broadcasts on May 7, 2002, a pair of sixteen-year-old students of Bishop Denis J. O'Connell High School had phoned the show to participate in a contest, whose winners would receive a chance to become cage dancers at an upcoming Kid Rock concert. The two students‚Äîwho assumed false names and claimed to be 18‚Äîdiscussed allegations of sexual activity at the school, goaded on by host Segal, including \\"graphic and explicit references to the sexual activities of the school's students and administrators\\" (such as oral sex). The next day, after learning that the two students had been suspended for the remarks, Segal criticized the school and its staff on-air, and proceeded to take further calls from O'Connell students that contained similar content. HD radio and translators right WWDC-HD2 broadcasts a conservative talk format branded as \\"104.7 Wonk FM\\"; the format launched on January 9, 2019, replacing the previous active rock format \\"104.7 Rock Nation\\". Programming primarily consists of syndicated content, including podcasts from HowStuffWorks, the Reaction Zone (an afternoon show which carries highlights of shows from other iHeartMedia conservative talk stations, along with alternating weather and traffic updates), Armstrong & Getty, and Joe Pags. The programming is simulcast by translator W284CQ (104.7 FM), which was originally located in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and later moved to northern Arlington, Virginia. WWDC-HD2 and W284CQ temporarily became the FM home of the Washington Capitals from January 23, 2017 through the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. The midseason deal came about after WJFK-FM (106.7 FM) elected not to renew its deal with the Capitals before the 2016‚Äì17 season, limiting the team's local broadcasts to WFED (1500 AM) and Internet streaming. The Washington Wizards share WFED as their home station and take precedence in conflicts; as a result, Capitals games were left without a home radio broadcast when both teams were playing, leading to complaints from fans and the media. WWDC-HD2 and W284CQ aired all Capitals games for the remainder of the 2016‚Äì17 season. At the time the deal was struck, the active rock format was also inaugurated. WWDC-HD2 ceased broadcasting the Capitals at the beginning of the 2017‚Äì18 season, as games returned to WJFK-FM. The two stations also added Baltimore Ravens coverage for the 2017 season, replacing WBIG-FM (100.3 FM) as the team's Washington outlet.

His experiences with fellow climber Heinrich Harrer during World War II were depicted in the 1997 film Seven Years in Tibet. Early life Born in Aurach, Austria, Peter Aufschnaiter went to high school in Kufstein. During his school education he was drafted into military service in the First World War in 1917. After he finished his final exams in 1919 he went to Munich in Germany to study agriculture. =Climbing= In his early years he began climbing in his beloved Kaiser mountain range and later, in Munich, Aufschnaiter became acquainted with several German alpinists of the time. He took part in expeditions to Kangchenjunga (1929 and 1931) in Sikkim, where he reached a height of . On these expeditions he had first contacts with Tibetans and learned the Tibetan language. =Nazi Party= After the Machtergreifung of 30 January 1933 he joined the Nazi Party. From 1936 he worked full-time for the German Himalaya Foundation (de) established that year by Paul Bauer. Capture and Tibet Grave of Peter Aufschnaiter in Kitzb√ºhel, Austria taken in 2016 After several attempts at the Nanga Parbat, Aufschnaiter led a small four-man expedition in 1939, including Heinrich Harrer, to the Diamir Face with the aim of finding an easier route to the peak. Having concluded that the face was viable, they were in Karachi at the end of August waiting for a freighter to take them home. The ship being long overdue, Harrer, Ludwig and Lobenhoffer tried to reach Persia with their shaky car, but several hundred kilometers northwest of Karachi were put under the \\"protection\\" of British soldiers and escorted back to Karachi, where Aufschnaiter had stayed on. Two days later war was declared and on 3 September 1939, all were put behind barbed wire to be transferred to a detention camp at Ahmednagar near Bombay two weeks later. They considered escaping to Portuguese Goa but when further transferred to Dehradun, where they were detained for years with 1,000 other enemy aliens, they found Tibet more promising. Their goal was the Japanese front in Burma or China. Aufschnaiter and Harrer escaped and were re-captured a number of times before finally succeeding. On 29 April 1944 after lunch a group of seven, Rolf Magener and Heins von Have disguised as British officers. Harrer, Aufschnaiter, the Salzburger Bruno Treipel (aka Treipl) and the Berliners Hans Kopp and Sattler, disguised as native Indian workers, walked out of the camp. While Magener and von Have took the train to Calcutta and from there found their way to the Japanese army in Burma,Magener Obituary THE NEW YORK TIMES Juli 3, 2000 Magener Obituary TELEGRAPH London 18 May 2000 the others headed for the closest border. After Sattler had given up on 10 May, the remaining four entered Tibet crossing the Tsang Chok-la Pass (5,896 metres) on 17 May 1944 and thereafter split into two groups: Harrer and Kopp, Aufschnaiter and Treipel. On 17 June Treipel, exhausted, bought himself a horse and rode back to the lowlands. Several months later, when the remaining three were still without visas for Tibet, Kopp gave up too and left for Nepal (where he was handed over to the British within a few days). Aufschnaiter and Harrer, helped by the former's knowledge of the Tibetan language, proceeded to the capital of Lhasa which they reached on 15 January 1946, having crossed Western Tibet (passing holy Mount Kailash), the South-West with Gyirong County and the Northern Changthang Plateau. From then on Aufschnaiter played an important role in Tibet. Employed by the government he helped plan a hydroelectric power plant and a sewage system for Lhasa and started first attempts at river regulations and reforestation in the area. He also looked into improving the quality of seeds. With Harrer he charted the first exact map of the capital city. His archaeological findings led to a correspondence with the scholar Giuseppe Tucci. His extensive work is described in Heinrich Harrer's Seven Years in Tibet and Harrer's autobiography Beyond Seven Years in Tibet: my life before, during and after. Aufschnaiter's own book Eight Years in Tibet, includes many of his own photographs and sketches. In October 1950 the advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to Lhasa forced Aufschnaiter and Harrer to join the caravan of the Dalai Lama when he retreated to the Chumbi Valley bordering Sikkim and India. Harrer proceeded to India, but Aufschnaiter stayed at Gyantse and left Tibet only 10 months later. Harrer's book, Seven years in Tibet states that, \\"On 20 December 1950, Peter left Lhasa. Heinrich Harrer had already left for southern Tibet in the middle of November, finally leaving the country in March 1951. But Aufschnaiter wanted to stay in Tibet as long as possible, and in fact remained another ten months. (...) at this time he was on the south-western frontier of Tibet. On the way there he visited the monastery of Rongphu, which the Chinese had not yet destroyed, and from there climbed, alone, as far as No. 1 camp on the northern ascent route to Everest.\\" He arrived in Nepal in 1952 where he worked as a cartographer and then in New Delhi, for the Indian Army. In 1955, he first-ascended Ronti (6063 m) in the Garhwal Himalaya together with Canadian George Hampson in pure alpine style. He eventually obtained a Nepalese passport which allowed him access to many restricted remote areas and he discovered valuable early Buddhist frescos. Aufschnaiter spent most of his remaining years in Nepal, working as an agricultural engineer. At first he worked for Swiss Technical Aid.Peter Aufschnaiter From 1956 on he held a position as an agriculture expert for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Death He returned to Austria much later in life and died in Innsbruck, Austria, in 1973 at the age of 73. He is buried at Kitzb√ºheler Bergfriedhof, Austria. Only very late in his life the introverted Aufschnaiter began writing memoirs but did not see them published. After his death the manuscript was first in the possession of mountaineer Paul Bauer. Finally it was edited and published by Tibet scholar Martin Brauen of the Museum of Ethnology at the University of Zurich. The 1997 film Seven Years in Tibet portrayed Aufschnaiter as having married a Tibetan tailor in Lhasa. His role was played by English actor David Thewlis.

Beedi making process, rare handicrafts in Akkaraipattu, Sri Lanka. Bidi leaf (Bauhinia racemosa) and shredded tobacco are prepared and finalize with thread binding. A beedi (also spelled bidi or biri) is a thin cigarette or mini-cigar filled with tobacco flake and commonly wrapped in a Tendu (Diospyros melanoxylon) or Piliostigma racemosum leaf tied with a string or adhesive at one end. It originates from the Indian subcontinent. The name is derived from the Marwari word beeda‚Äîa mixture of betel nuts, herbs, and spices wrapped in a leaf. It is a traditional method of tobacco use throughout South Asia and parts of the Middle East, where Beedies are popular and inexpensive. In India, beedi consumption outpaces conventional cigarettes accounting for 48% of all Indian tobacco consumption in 2008.  History  Beedies were invented after Indian tobacco cultivation began in the late 17th century. Tobacco workers were the first to create them by taking leftover tobacco and rolling it in leaves. The commercial Indian beedi industry saw rapid growth during the 1930s probably driven by an expansion of tobacco cultivation at the time but also helped by Gandhi's support of Indian industry and Indian products. Perhaps due to this, educated classes in India grew to prefer beedies to cigarettes although this is no longer the case. Muslim leaders, calling cigarettes foreign products, have also endorsed beedies at times. By the middle of the 20th century beedi manufacture had grown into a highly competitive industry. This stage of commercial production‚Äîat the height of the beedi's popularity‚Äîsaw the creation of many new beedi brands as well as beedi factories employing upwards of one hundred, primarily male, beedi rollers. Factory-based beedi production declined as a result of increased regulation during the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, and beedi-making became a cottage industry with a home-based women workforce predominantly employed only in the beedi rolling. In contrast, males continue to be employed in other aspects of beedi production. Beedi smoking tends to be associated with a lower social standing, and these tobacco-filled leaves are inexpensive when compared to regular cigarettes. Those with a high social standing who do smoke beedies often do so out of the public eye; however, the cultural trend is changing.  Manufacture  Factory workers hand cut the leaves using scissors and a metal stencil guide. After cutting a sufficient number of wrappers, they will move on to roll approximately 1,000 beedies each per day. Over 8 million Indians are employed in the manufacture of beedies, a cottage industry that is typically done by women in their homes. Workers roll an average of 500‚Äì1000 beedies per day, handling of tobacco flake. Handling tobacco and inhaling its dust is an occupational hazard for beedi workers as an increased level of chromosome aberrations was found in a scientific study. The production of beedies is also popular in Bangladesh. According to the 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor published by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the informal sector in these countries employs underage children in the production of beedies \\"in response to consumer preferences\\". Informal sector making beedi. = Tendu leaf = Tendu (Diospyros melanoxylon) leaves make excellent wrappers, and the success of the beedi is due, in part, to this leaf. The leaves are in abundance shortly after the tobacco crop is cured and so are ready to be used in beedi manufacture. Collected in the summer and made into bundles, the leaves are dried in the sun for three to six days before being used as wrappers.  Global popularity  Beedies, unlike cigarettes, must be drawn frequently to keep them lit, and doing so requires effort. = North America = In the United States, beedies are treated like conventional cigarettes. They are taxed at the same rates, are required to have a tax stamp, and must carry the Surgeon General's warning. However, a study done in San Francisco showed that about four in ten packs of beedies did not contain the required warning label and seven in ten did not carry the tax stamp. 2006 statistics on beedi usage show that 2.9% of high school students in the United States take part in beedi smoking compared to 1.4% of those aged 18 to 24. Some beedies are flavoured. Both Canada and the US have banned flavoured cigarettes. = United Kingdom = Beedis are currently legal in the UK and are subject to the same taxation as cigarettes. One must be aged 18 or over to purchase them.Sharrow Mills, \\"The Encyclopaedia of Tobacco\\", Wilsons of Sharrow, 2018 Health warnings Beedies deliver more nicotine, carbon monoxide, and tar and carry a greater risk of oral cancers. As with many other types of smoking, beedies increase the risk of certain kinds of cancers, heart disease, and lung disease. They may also be more harmful than other forms of tobacco consumption. Frequency of ventilatory abnormalities was highest in the cigarette smokers. A lower prevalence of chronic bronchitis and abnormal ventilatory measurements in beedi smokers, as compared with cigarette smokers, was thought to be primarily due to low total consumption of tobacco. Some added influence of smoke produced by burning of the wrapper leaf and type of tobacco used in beedies could not be ruled out.

Der einsame Sieg: Mount Everest '78, Goldmann. is an Austrian mountaineer. He was born in Mayrhofen, Austria. He developed an interest in mountain climbing at age six. Among his accomplishments as a mountaineer are his first ascents in the Rocky Mountains. He was also the first European to climb on the Big Walls in Yosemite National Park. He began climbing with Reinhold Messner in 1969. Several accomplishments in mountaineering followed. The most notable event was the first ascent without supplemental oxygen of Mount Everest on 8 May 1978 together with Messner, which was previously thought to be impossible. A year after his climb on Everest he published Lonely Victory (\\"Der einsame Sieg\\". Autor: Eberhard Fuchs) in 1978. Habeler set further records by descending from the summit to the South Col in only one hour and climbing the North Face of the Eiger in ten hours. Other eight-thousanders (mountains over 8,000 meters) that Habeler has summited are Cho Oyu, Nanga Parbat, Kangchenjunga and Gasherbrum I. He has also climbed Yerupaja Chico (6089 m) in Peru's Cordillera Huayhuash. The ascent of Gasherbrum I was made with Messner in 1975, Alpine-style in three days, and is seen by some as ushering in a new era of Alpine-style ascents of eight-thousanders, in contrast to the \\"siege\\" tactics which had largely prevailed to this time. It was the first time an eight-thousander had been climbed Alpine-style. Habeler attempted to climb Everest again in 2000 but failed to do so due to fluid in his lungs. Habeler became a skiing instructor at age twenty one and founded the Peter Habeler Ski and Mountaineering School in his hometown of Mayrhofen, Austria. The school is now run by his son, though Habeler still teaches on occasion. At age 74, he repeated an ascent on The Eiger's north face with David Lama.http://www.planetmountain.com/en/photos/peter-habeler-74-climbs-eiger- north-face-again-with-david-lama/44543?s=2 References Category:Austrian mountain climbers Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Summiters of Mount Everest Category:People associated with the Eiger Category:People from Schwaz District Category:Sportspeople from Tyrol (state) ","title":"Peter Habeler"},{"id":"1917971","text":"'s may refer to: * 's, an ending used to form the possessive of English nouns and noun phrases * 's, a contraction of the English words is and has * 's, a form of the English plural ending, written after single letters and in some other instances (see also Greengrocers' apostrophes) * 's, a contraction of the old Dutch genitive article des, appearing in names such as 's-Hertogenbosch See also * All pages beginning with 's * All pages beginning with 'S * Apostrophe * -s (disambiguation) * S (disambiguation) ","title":"'s"},{"id":"1917977","text":"or is a manga and anime superhero created in 1963 by science fiction writer Kazumasa Hirai and manga artist Jiro Kuwata. He is considered Japan's earliest cyborg superhero, predating even Kamen Rider (later that same year, Shotaro Ishinomori created Cyborg 009) The manga was published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine and ran from 1963 to 1966. The anime series, produced by Eiken with the TCJ Animation Center, was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System, and ran from November 17, 1963, to December 31, 1964, with a total of 56 episodes (plus the \\"farewell\\" special episode, \\"Goodbye, Eightman\\"). Plot Murdered by criminals, Detective Yokoda's body is retrieved by Professor Tani and taken to his laboratory. There, Tani performs an experiment that has failed seven times; Yokoda is the eighth subject to have his life force transferred into an android body. For the first time, the experiment succeeds. Yokoda is reborn as the armor-skinned android 8 Man, able to dash at impossible speeds, as well as shape-shift into other people. He shifts himself into Yokoda, this time christening himself as \\"Hachiro Azuma\\". He keeps this identity a secret, known only to Tani and his police boss Chief Tanaka. Even his girlfriend Sachiko and friend Ichiro do not know he is an android. As 8-Man, Hachiro fights crime (even bringing his own murderers to justice). To rejuvenate his powers, he smokes \\"energy\\" cigarettes that he carries in a cigarette case on his belt. In Japan, the character's origin actually varies significantly between the original manga, the TV series, and the live-action movie. In the original Japanese manga and TV series, the character's name does not change when he is reborn as 8 Man. The \\"Detective Yokoda\\" name was created for the live-action version. In the manga, Detective Azuma is trapped in a warehouse and gunned down, while the TV series has him killed when he is run over by a car. Also, in the Japanese story, the character is called \\"8 Man\\" because he is considered an extra member of the Japanese police force. There are seven regular police precincts and 8 Man is treated as an unofficial eighth precinct all to himself. The Japanese manga was presented as serial novella stories along with a set of one-shot stories. Many of the stories were edited down and adapted for the TV series, but not all of them. The novella stories were originally printed on a weekly basis in Shukuu Sh≈çnen Magazine in 16-page increments that consisted of 15 story pages and one title page. Ten additional one-shot stories were presented in seasonal and holiday specials of Shuukuu Sh≈çnen Magazine. These stories were generally between 30-40 pages in length. In the North American version of the series the resurrected detective/android is known as \\"Tobor\\" or the word \\"robot\\" spelled backwards. Tani is referred to as \\"Professor Genius\\" and the sobriquet of 8-Man is changed slightly to \\"8th- Man\\", the name explained as he is the 8th attempt at such a super-robot. The story content was clearly directed toward a wider audience of both young and adult viewers. As such much of the violence was toned down for Western audiences. Due to changes in cigarette advertising laws in the 1960s, television characters were not allowed to be seen smoking. As this was a major plot device in the series, the show was forced to be removed from broadcast in the United States.

Building on Astro Boy, 8 Man helped to shape the trajectory of robot and cyborg heroes for the next decade.\\" Legacy The 8 Man franchise was revived in the early 1990s by a live-action film, video game and new animated series. = Video game = In 1991, SNK released a video game edition of Eight Man for the Neo- Geo arcade and home video game system (both versions are identical) where the player took the role of 8 Man and his robo-comrade 9 Man in a fight against an invading evil robot army. The game was released internationally. While the game stayed true to the concept of a crime-fighting super-robot, it was widely panned for being tedious and relying too much on the gimmick of its speed- running effect. =Live-action movie= In 1992, a live-action film version of 8 Man was produced in Japan. Titled Eitoman - Subete no Sabishƒ´ Yoru no Tame ni (, lit. 8 Man - For All the Lonely NightTranslation of 8 Man Japanese subtitle by Google Translate), it was directed by Yasuhiro Horiuchi and starred Kai Shishido as the title character and Toshihide Wakamatsu as Detective Yokota. Distributed in the United States by Fox Lorber video simply as 8 Man, the movie was widely panned for its choppy editing, mediocre direction and low-budget feel. Many modern American viewers, unfamiliar with the older animated series, felt the movie was an inferior version of RoboCop, despite the fact that the latter was a much more recent franchise. =8 Man After= In mid-1993, the mantle of 8 Man was taken up by Hazama Itsuru in the OVA series 8 Man After. Existing in a world far more corrupt than that of his predecessor, the new 8 Man had no qualms about being extremely violent towards the cybernetic criminals who had murdered him previously. Licensed by Streamline Pictures where it went out of print until being released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 2001. It has since been released by Discotek Media in 2016 with Japanese audio and English subtitles for the first time. =8 Man Infinity= A manga comic strip called is being authored by Kyoichi Nanatsuki under Kodansha, which is being serialized under Kodansha's Magazine Z. =8 Man vs Cyborg 009= A crossover between 8 Man and Cyborg 009 by Kyoichi Nanatsuk (script) and Masato Hayate (art), began serializing in Champion Red on July 18, 2020.

It then proceeds north-west to the King George Square busway station, a large interchange with several stops on each of its two underground platforms. It then surfaces near Roma Street railway station and follows the alignment of the main city train lines. Roma Street busway station is adjacent to the train platforms and is on the same level. Platform 2 is shared by both trains and buses, although the only train to currently use Platform 2 is NSW TrainLink's daily XPT service to Sydney.

A past state government (the Newman Government) had indicated an intention to revisit the alignment for this project. Their primary points of departure from the policy of the previous government were a preference not to build the full busway option, nor to take the busway all the way to The Prince Charles Hospital. These changes were predicated on the perceived high expense of the previously published preferred options.

He is best known for his time with ECW and WWE. Before working for WWE, Styles was a full-time professional in the field of print advertising sales in New York City. He started selling digital advertising with WWE and is now selling digital advertising full-time in New York City.  Early life  Bonsignore's family moved from The Bronx to Connecticut when he was in middle school,Loverro, Thom (2006). The Rise and Fall of ECW. Pocket Books. . p. 103 where he still resides. He is of Italian descent. Bonsignore chose to attend to Hofstra University over other schools because they had a strong communications program with their own television studio and station, and because the Long Island, New York campus was close to Pro Wrestling Illustrated's offices. He hoped to get an internship at Pro Wrestling Illustrated, which he eventually did. That internship got him backstage at a World Championship Wrestling show where he first met Paul Heyman, his future employer. Later, Heyman visited the offices of Pro Wrestling and Bonsignore showed him a tape of his announcing with the North American Wrestling Alliance. That led to Heyman hiring Styles for ECW when he graduated from Hofstra in 1993.Loverro, Thom (2006). The Rise and Fall of ECW. Pocket Books. . p. 104 Career =North American Wrestling Alliance (1992-1993)= Joey Styles got his start in professional wrestling announcing while still attending Hofstra University by working for Tony Capone's North American Wrestling Alliance. He would often split time with former WWE announcer Craig DeGeorge or join DeGeorge for a two-man commentary team. Styles would also host a segment called \\"NAWA Superstar Stats\\" where he would talk about the wrestlers and their accomplishments. This NAWA aired on Sportschannel America (now NBC Sports Network through mergers and acquisitions) for a brief time. NAWA September 1992 =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993-2001)= Styles is best known for his work in Extreme Championship Wrestling during its entire run, from 1993 to its 2001 bankruptcy. He debuted at the Super Summer Sizzler Spectacular show in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 19, 1993. Styles was the sole host of ECW Hardcore TV and spent the early portion of the run as the promotion's only announcer. Providing both play-by-play and color commentary during television and pay-per-view broadcasts, Styles added his wrestling knowledge, enthusiasm, and comedic timing to the program. He briefly left ECW in 1994 only to return a few weeks later. At Barely Legal, he became the first and only wrestling announcer in history to call a live pay-per-view event solo. Later on in the promotion, he was joined on commentary by Rick Rude on Hardcore TV, Joel Gertner for ECW on TNN, and later Cyrus for pay-per-views. Styles also worked full-time in ad sales for News America Marketing, a division of News Corp in New York City. After ECW, Styles briefly appeared in XPW but quit after one show, returning all cheques that he had been paid. =Major League Wrestling (2002)= After a brief sabbatical from the wrestling industry, Joey Styles would return to wrestling announcing for Court Bauer's Major League Wrestling as the \\"voice of MLW.\\" Joey's return to wrestling would be heralded as he was one of the first names to be announced by the company during its 2002 launch. Initially calling the action for MLW's home video releases, Styles's presence would grow upon MLW inking a major television pact with Sun Sports and several other international distributors. Hosting the weekly 11 pm series, \\"MLW Underground,\\" Styles returned his to his roots in the booth as a solo broadcaster, praised for his calling of memorable matches including a barbed wire match between Terry Funk and Steve Corino, amongst others. Styles continued in advertising sales full-time. =World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE= ECW One Night Stand (2005) Styles signed a one night deal with World Wrestling Entertainment to call the first- ever ECW One Night Stand event, where he and Mick Foley did commentary for the show. He hosted and announced Hardcore Homecoming on two nights earlier from the former ECW Arena in Philadelphia. The sold out event featured former ECW stars Shane Douglas, The Sandman, Sabu, Terry Funk, Raven, The Blue Meanie, Mikey Whipwreck, Jerry Lynn, New Jack, 2 Cold Scorpio and more. Raw and ECW (2005‚Äì2008) On November 1, 2005, he made an appearance at World Wrestling Entertainment's Taboo Tuesday. Styles was brought in to fill-in for Jonathan Coachman, as Coachman had a match against Batista. Joey joined WWE's Raw as a play-by-play announcer on November 7. On December 4, 2005, it was confirmed by WWE.com that Joey signed a five-year contract to be the official play-by-play commentator for Raw.This would be the first time in Styles' career that he would work in wrestling full-time. In an earlier interview done by WWE.com, he mentioned that becoming the voice of Raw was a childhood dream come true. Styles also stated that calling WrestleMania was one of his lifelong dreams growing up. However, despite being the lead announcer for Raw, it was announced that he would not provide commentary for WrestleMania 22, which instead featured Jim Ross calling the matches for Raw. Styles learned that he would not be announcing at WrestleMania 22 when he arrived on Raw on March 27, 2006. The reason for Styles not calling the event is that Vince McMahon disliked pure play-by-play announcing and wanted a \\"storyteller\\" instead. Jim Ross had a similar problem when he first joined WWE, and Styles has credited Ross for teaching him the WWE style of commentary upon his return. However, Joey Styles was present at WrestleMania 22, losing his \\"WrestleMania virginity\\" as he put it, calling the Hardcore Match between Mick Foley and Edge. This was Styles' idea, as he wanted to achieve his lifelong dream of calling a match at WrestleMania and pitched the idea to Vince McMahon by explaining that he had called more Hardcore/ECW style matches than any other announcer in history. On the May 1, 2006 edition of Raw, Styles announced that he was quitting by delivering a worked shoot promo, in which he bashed Vince McMahon, WWE, sports entertainment, and the fact that people \\"buy into this crap\\". To further the storyline, his profile was removed from both the Raw superstars section and the ECW One Night Stand subsite. Styles remained under contract with WWE after he quit Raw; however, making his next appearance at WWE vs. ECW Head to Head. Here, he provided commentary with Tazz and announced that (now former ECW Representative) Paul Heyman had reinstated him as commentator of the new ECW brand of WWE. He provided commentary for ECW One Night Stand 2006 on June 11 and went on to announce ECW's weekly show on Sci-Fi. In April 2008, Styles began working on WWE.com, with Mike Adamle replacing him as ECW's play by play commentator. He stated repeatedly that he had retired from announcing full-time and was thrilled to continue to work for WWE as Director of Digital Media Content. Styles was soon after promoted to Vice President of Digital Media Content. WWE Digital Media (2008‚Äì2016) As Vice President of Digital Media Content, Styles worked on WWE.com and the WWE app, writing and editing as well as working closely with WWE's sales and sponsorship division. Additionally, Styles hosted a show called Oh My God! Moment of the Week that ran from September 2008 to December 2008. On the December 8, 2008 episode of Raw, Styles presented the \\"O M G!\\" Moment of the Year award at the 2008 Slammy Awards with Alicia Fox, saying his famous \\"Oh My God!\\" catchphrase. In 2010, Styles' announcing contract expired, but he remained with WWE as a non-contracted employee and continued to host \\"History of ECW\\" on WWE Classics On Demand TV service until it was discontinued in January 2014 because of the launch of WWE Network. Episodes of ECW Hardcore TV which aired in syndication from 1993-2000 and was hosted and announced by Styles are available on WWE Network along with all ECW pay-per-views. Due to music licensing issues, some of the commentary by Styles from ECW pay-per- views on the WWE Network has been re-recorded by Styles. Styles continued to host the \\"ECW Unreleased\\" WWE home video series. On November 11, 2014, Styles and Paul Heyman hosted WWE Network special ECW Exposed. Styles appeared in WWE 2K16, announcing an ECW match between Steve Austin and Mikey Whipwreck in the Austin 3:16 showcase. On August 8, 2016, it was reported that Styles was released from WWE and returned to advertising sales in New York City. =YESNetwork.com (2012)= In addition to his duties on WWE.com, during the 2012 baseball season, Styles hosted a weekly webcast called \\"Pinstripe Plays of the Week\\" on YES Network.com, where he would give a recap of the best weekly plays from the New York Yankees. =Independent circuit (2016)= From September 2 to 4, 2016, Styles provided commentary for the Chikara promotion's 2016 King of Trios tournament. After his release from WWE, Styles went on record as saying he wanted \\"to be the Voice of the Indies\\" while still working full-time in advertising sales. On November 12, Styles took part in Evolve's Evolve 72 event. Before the main event of the show, Styles made a joke involving Donald Trump and announcer Joanna Rose, stating Trump \\"would like to grab her by the...\\" but never said the word. Evolve's booker Gabe Sapolsky immediately apologized for the comment, before announcing that Evolve had terminated Styles. Two days later, Beyond Wrestling and Chikara also announced they were severing ties with Styles. After that incident, Styles retired from pro wrestling.

Early life and education Joseph G. Totten was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Peter Gilbert Totten and Grace Mansfield. He was the tenth person to graduate from the United States Military Academy, being one of three graduating members of the class of 1805. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers on July 1, 1805. He resigned in March 1806 to assist his uncle, Major Jared Mansfield, who was then serving as Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory. He was a cousin of Joseph K. Mansfield, who rose to the rank of major general and died at the Battle of Antietam. Military career Totten re-entered the Corps of Engineers in February 1808 and helped build Castle Williams and Castle Clinton in New York harbor. During the War of 1812, he was chief engineer of the Niagara frontier and Lake Champlain armies under General Stephen Van Rensselaer. At the Battle of Queenston Heights, he fought alongside Winfield Scott, who used Totten's cravat as a white flag to signal the American surrender.John Robert Elting (1995), Amateurs to Arms: A Military History of the War of 1812, New York: Da Capo, p. 48. He was brevetted lieutenant colonel for gallant conduct in the Battle of Plattsburgh. As a member of the first permanent Board of Engineers, to which he was appointed in 1816, along with General Simon Bernard, he laid down durable principles of coast defense construction in a report to Congress in 1821. From 1825 until 1838, Totten oversaw the construction of Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island. Fort Adams was the second-largest construction project attempted by the army in the 19th century, after Fort Monroe in Virginia. Totten employed recent graduates of West Point as assistant engineers at Fort Adams, and taught them advanced engineering techniques. Totten's apprentices included John G. Barnard, George W. Cullum, Pierre G. T. Beauregard, and Alexander D. Bache, all of whom earned distinction during the Civil War. While at Fort Adams, Totten conducted experiments with various mortar compositions and published a paper of his findings: Brief Observations on Common Mortars, Hydraulic Mortars and Concretes.Ann Johnson, \\"Material Experiments: Environment and Engineering Institutions in the Early American Republic,\\" Osiris, NS 24 (2009), 53-74. In 1833, Totten purchased the Francis Malbone House on Thames Street in Newport. At that time, it was the most opulent house in Newport. He lived there for the remainder of his time in Newport. Totten was appointed Chief Engineer of the United States Army in 1838, and served in that position until his death in 1864, the longest tenure of any chief engineer. As chief engineer, he was intimately involved with every aspect of the Army Corps of Engineers activities, from fortifications to harbor improvement. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1841. Beginning in 1844, Totten was involved with the construction of Fort Montgomery on Lake Champlain in upstate New York. During this period, Totten invented an iron-reinforced embrasure for cannon. Known as \\"Totten shutters,\\" the hinged swinging doors were installed on the cannon openings of the fort between the mortar and brick facade. Balanced to swing freely, the iron shutters would be forced open by the gasses expelled from the cannon, and then rebound shut immediately afterwards, shielding the gunners from incoming fire. First installed in American forts in 1857, the design was incorporated in such locations as Fort Montgomery, Fort Delaware, Fort John C. Calhoun (Fort Wool), and Fort Jefferson, Florida. Brief Observations On Common Mortars, Hydraulic Mortars, and Concretes Totten was greatly admired by General Scott, for whom he directed the siege of Veracruz as his chief engineer during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He later served as a Civil War Union Army general, being brevetted as a U.S. Army brigadier general in 1847 and receiving his permanent appointment in 1863. One of Totten's most significant achievements was the design and construction of the Minot's Ledge Light near Cohasset, Massachusetts. Previous efforts to build a lighthouse on the small ledge of rock had failed but Totten conceived a plan whereby the lighthouse would be pinned by its own weight to the ledge, making it able to withstand the harshest extremes of weather. It stands to this day flashing a distinctive 1‚Äì4‚Äì3 light pattern which has been interpreted to mean \\"I LOVE YOU\\". Totten served most of his time as chief engineer in the rank of colonel but was promoted to brigadier general on March 3, 1863. Totten was promoted to brevet major general on April 21, 1864, having served almost six decades in the army. He died the following day of pneumonia in Washington, D.C., and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery there. Namesakes Several military and civil locations have been named after Totten. The Civil War-era Fort Totten was built as part of the Defenses of Washington, D.C. A few earthworks remain in Fort Totten Park. The surrounding neighborhood, an apartment house development (Aventine Fort Totten),http://aventineforttotten.com . Retrieved December 28, 2011. and a Washington DC Metro station bear his name. Fort Totten (Queens) is a historic former U.S. Army fort maintained by New York City. Fort Totten, North Dakota hosts Fort Totten State Historic Site, named for the General, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Tottenville, Staten Island, was named for the family of an older relative, one of three \\"Captain Tottens\\" who supported the Loyalist cause during the American Revolution. Robert E. Lee surveyed Biscayne Bay in (Miami) in 1850 for the Army Corps of Engineers under then-Colonel Joseph Totten. Lee named Totten Key just south of Caesars Creek for him.

The complex was built in two stages, between 1961-1968 and between 1970-1977, and is Germany's largest student housing complex with 2,478 residential units in 14 buildings. Next to the Olympic Village, it is the second largest complex of the Studentenwerk M√ºnchen. In order to create affordable housing relatively quickly, several \\"Wohncontainer\\" (similar to mobile homes) have been set up near the original buildings. Today, more than 2,500 people live in \\"StuSta\\". The streets that run through Studentenstadt are named after the World War II era resistance group, the White Rose. For example, they are named Willi-Graf-Stra√üe, Hans-Leipelt- Stra√üe, and Christoph-Probst-Stra√üe. Location Studentenstadt is located in northern Munich (Freimann) between the Autobahn A9 and the northern part of the Englischer Garten in the neighborhood of Schwabing. The nearest U-Bahn stop, Studentenstadt, is served by the U6. A number of bus lines also serve the station (50, 143, 177, 181, 231, and 233). History The concept was first developed by Egon Wiberg, the rector of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t. It was founded by the Studentenwerk M√ºnchen. After the Bavarian Prime Minister, Hanns Siedel, set aside a parcel of land of about 8 hectares on the border of the English Garden for use, a series of hearings and meetings took place between the state of Bavaria and Studentenwerk M√ºnchen. At the beginning of the project, the Max Kade Foundation donated 1,000,000 German marks. There was then an architectural competition in 1960. The resulting winner was Ernst Maria Lang, with the architectural company Lang und Pogadl. After that, about 1,500 living spaces were planned in Studentenstadt, and this count was later raised to 2,500 in 1971. Construction began in 1961, and Studentenstadt was built in four stages. In the first stage, between 1961 and 1963, Houses 1-6 were built. In the second, between 1966 and 1968, Houses 7 and 8 were built. In the third, between 1971 and 1973, Houses 9 and 10 were built. Finally, in the final stage, the last four houses were built between 1974 and 1975. A few of these houses are named, mostly after those who supported construction. In 1975, a children's nursery was opened, and the Hans-Scholl-Halle was built between 1976 and 1977. The U-Bahn stop at Studentenstadt was opened on October 19, 1971, just as 8 of the 14 houses were completed. The Residences The Studentenstadt has two primary areas: \\"Altstadt\\" (old city), consisting of several 2 to 3 floor buildings plus two 9 floor towers, and \\"Neustadt\\" (new city), where students live in 7 - 20 floor towers. \\"Altstadt\\" consists of 627 single-room apartments with a size of 8 - 20 square meters each. Each one contains a sink. Kitchens, showers, and toilets are shared by all. There are also community lounges. \\"Neustadt\\" consists of 1,458 single-room apartments. All apartments have a kitchenette, shower, and toilet. There are also 54 married couples apartments with 35 - 77 square meters of living space. They have two rooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom. Rugby There is a rugby union club in the Studentenstadt, the StuSta M√ºnchen. Soccer There is a soccer club in the Studentenstadt, that also includes a women soccer team. The Manhattan The Manhattan is a shared facility located in the tallest building in the Studentenstadt. During the summer it is located indoors on the 21st floor. When the weather permits, the Manhattan uses the west terrace on the 19th floor. It is operated by a group of students who live in the StuSta and subject to the jurisdiction of the \\"Heimrat\\" (the city council of the StuSta). Cultural Life StuStaCulum 2010 The highpoint of cultural life at Studentenstadt is the Student Culture Festival, or StuStaCulum, a festival held annually since 1989 in early summer by many theatre groups, bands, and artists. It attracts about 20'000 visitors every year. Another special was the student club 20 1/2, supervised by Robin Wachsmann between 2010-2017. Unfortunately, it was closed due to construction. Public transportation Adjacent to Studentenstadt is the Studentenstadt subway station, which provides access to the U6 line and some Metro bus routes. That station is one of few stations that are built above ground.

The objects of the Appeal as stated in its constitution were \\"to provide medicines, medical equipment and medical assistance to the people of Iraq; to highlight the causes and results of the cancer epidemic in Iraq and to arrange for the medical treatment of a number of Iraqi children outside Iraq\\". The campaign was founded by the politician George Galloway, then a member of parliament, Princess Sarvath, wife of then Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, was patron of the Appeal. The Mariam Appeal was intended \\"to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq.\\" The campaign was named after Mariam Hamza, a child flown by the fund from Iraq to Britain to receive treatment for leukaemia. The intention was to raise awareness of the suffering and death of tens of thousands of other Iraqi children due to poor health conditions and lack of suitable medicines and facilities, and to campaign for the lifting of the sanctions seen by many as a direct cause of those problems. Among the activities undertaken was a daily newsletter on sanctions, a sanctions-busting flight to Baghdad, the Big Ben to Baghdad trip in a red London bus, meetings and conferences, the projection of an anti-war slogan on the House of Commons, and the facilitating of trips to Iraq by dozens of journalists. Investigations The fund received scrutiny during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, after a complaint to the office of the Attorney General for England and Wales that Galloway used some of the donation money to pay his travel expenses. Galloway, however, denied that he had misused any funds raised for the Mariam Appeal and pointed out that it was reasonable for money from a campaign fund to be used to pay for the travel expenses of campaigners. Over the next four years Galloway faced several investigations related to the Appeal including the Oil-for-Food Program Hearings. =Charity Commission investigations= The Mariam Appeal was investigated by the Charity Commission on more than one occasion. Although the Appeal was not a registered charity, the commission had jurisdiction to take action on funds raised in England and Wales on charitable grounds. The report of the first, year-long, inquiry was published in June 2004. The Charity Commission took the view that the political activities of the Appeal were ancillary to the charitable purposes of the Appeal and that the Trustees could reasonably have formed the view that this would have the impact of enabling treatment for sick children. The Commission found that the Appeal had done charitable work and raised significant funds, so should have registered with them and published accounts, taking the view that the legal advice the Appeal founders had taken that the constitution did not create a charity was wrong. It established that Dr. Amineh Abu-Zayyad, a Palestinian, who was married to Galloway between 2000 and 2005, had received unauthorised benefits in the form of salary payments from the Appeal's funds, although the executive committee considered these payments necessary and were unaware that they were unauthorised. The Charity Commission did not find other evidence to support the allegations that funds had been misused. Examination of the Appeal's bank accounts revealed the major funders to be the United Arab Emirates, a donor from Saudi Arabia and the Jordanian businessman Fawaz Zureikat (later alleged to be implicated in the Oil-for-Food Programme scandal). Some of the Appeal's books and records had been sent to Amman and Baghdad in 2001 when Fawaz Zuriekat took over as Chairman of the Appeal and could not now be located. The Appeal had not produced annual profit and loss accounts or balance sheets. As the Appeal was by this time closed, full records were unavailable, that the founders believed on legal advice that they had not created a charity, and there was no evidence that the funds of the Appeal were misapplied (other than for salaries), the Charity Commission decided to take no further action other than informing the Trustees of their mistakes. A further Charity Commission Report published on 7 June 2007 found that the Appeal had received funds from Fawaz Zureikat that originated from the Oil For Food programme. =House of Commons Investigation= The UK Parliament's Standards Commissioner launched a four-year investigation independently of the Charity Commission, but with its involvement.Galloway over oil-for-food charity deals At a press conference following publication of the report, Galloway stated \\"To be deprived of the company for 18 days of the honourable ladies and gentleman behind me [in parliament] will be painful ... but I'm intending to struggle on regardless ... What really upset them [the committee] is that I always defend myself. Later developments It was claimed in June 2017, after a request under the Freedom of Information Act by The Times newspaper that Galloway's then wife Dr. Amineh Abu-Zayyad had received ¬£84,000 in salary and expenses from the appeal after being appointed as its medical and scientific officer without any appropriate process and without a contract of employment. The Yorkhill NHS Trust in Glasgow received ¬£54,000 drawn from the appeal in partial payment for the care of Mariam Hamza herself. Both Galloway, who claimed ¬£3,000 in travel expenses, and his wife were trustees of the charity. Legally, The Times Dominic Kennedy wrote, a person in such a position of trust is not permitted to benefit financially without proper authorisation.

Purtscheller pioneered climbing without a mountain guide, who in the 19th century did all the route finding and lead climbing. By the end of his life he had recorded climbing over 1,700 mountains. A celebrated climb was the traverse of the Meije together with the Zsigmondy brothers in 1885, which to this date is considered a classic alpine route. He is best known as the first European to ascend Kilimanjaro in 1889, together with the German mountaineer Hans Meyer. After a descent of the Aiguille du Dru with G.

History The regiment was formed shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War by order of William Gilpin, the first governor of the territory. Recruiters began enlisting men in August 1861, just six months after the organization of the territory. Known as \\"Gilpin's Pet Lambs\\" for the involvement of the governor in its formation, the regiment served in the Western Theater, at first serving in various detachments throughout the territory. The regiment's most notable service came in the New Mexico Campaign in the spring of 1862, in which they helped repulse the advance of the Army of New Mexico under Henry Hopkins Sibley at the battles of Glorieta Pass and Peralta. In November 1862, the unit was reorganized along with Companies C and D of the 2nd Colorado Infantry into the 1st Colorado Cavalry. (This was done since the US War Department believed cavalry would be better in protecting the Western trails and for fighting the various Indian tribes.) The first colonel of the regiment was John P. Slough, replaced in April 1862 by Major John Chivington, later chastised for his role as commander of the 3rd Colorado Cavalry in the November 1864 Sand Creek Massacre.

Limb loss is a result of either removal by amputation or congenital limb deficiency. However, phantom limb sensations can also occur following nerve avulsion or spinal cord injury. Sensations are recorded most frequently following the amputation of an arm or a leg, but may also occur following the removal of a breast, tooth, or an internal organ. Phantom limb pain is the feeling of pain in an absent limb or a portion of a limb. The pain sensation varies from individual to individual. Phantom limb sensation is any sensory phenomenon (except pain) which is felt at an absent limb or a portion of the limb. It has been known that at least 80% of amputees experience phantom sensations at some time of their lives. Some experience some level of this phantom pain and feeling in the missing limb for the rest of their lives. The term \\"phantom limb\\" was first coined by American neurologist Silas Weir Mitchell in 1871. Mitchell described that \\"thousands of spirit limbs were haunting as many good soldiers, every now and then tormenting them\\". However, in 1551, French military surgeon Ambroise Par√© recorded the first documentation of phantom limb pain when he reported that, \\"For the patients, long after the amputation is made, say that they still feel pain in the amputated part\\". Signs and symptoms Phantom pain involves the sensation of pain in a part of the body that has been removed. Symptoms include: Onset within the first few days of amputation. Comes and goes or is continuous. Often affects the part of the limb farthest from the body, such as the foot of an amputated leg. May be described as shooting, stabbing, boring, squeezing, throbbing or burning. Sometimes feels as if the phantom part is forced into an uncomfortable position. May be triggered by pressure on the remaining part of the limb or emotional stress. =Types= There are various types of sensations that may be felt: *Sensations related to the phantom limb's posture, length and volume e.g. feeling that the phantom limb is behaving just like a normal limb like sitting with the knee bent or feeling that the phantom limb is as heavy as the other limb. Sometimes, an amputee will experience a sensation called telescoping, the feeling that the phantom limb is gradually shortening over time. *Sensations of movement (e.g. feeling that the phantom foot is moving). *Sensations of touch, temperature, pressure and itchiness. Many amputees report of feeling heat, tingling, itchiness, and pain. Pathophysiology The neurological basis and mechanisms for phantom limb pain are all derived from experimental theories and observations. Little is known about the true mechanism causing phantom pains, and many theories highly overlap. Historically, phantom pains were thought to originate from neuromas located at the stump tip. Traumatic neuromas, or non-tumor nerve injuries, often arise from surgeries and result from the abnormal growth of injured nerve fibers. Although stump neuromas contribute to phantom pains, they are not the sole cause. This is because patients with congenital limb deficiency can sometimes, although rarely, experience phantom pains. This suggests that there is a central representation of the limb responsible for painful sensations. Currently, theories are based on altered neurological pathways and cortical reorganization. =Peripheral mechanisms= Neuromas formed from injured nerve endings at the stump site are able to fire abnormal action potentials, and were historically thought to be the main cause of phantom limb pain. Although neuromas are able to contribute to phantom pain, pain is not completely eliminated when peripheral nerves are treated with conduction blocking agents. Physical stimulation of neuromas can increase C fiber activity, thus increasing phantom pain, but pain still persists once the neuromas have ceased firing action potentials. The peripheral nervous system is thought to have at most a modulation effect on phantom limb pain. =Spinal mechanisms= In addition to peripheral mechanisms, spinal mechanisms are thought to have an influencing role in phantom pains. Peripheral nerve injury can lead to the degeneration of C fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and terminating A fibers may subsequently branch into the same lamina. If this occurs, A fiber inputs could be reported as noxious stimuli. Substance P, involved in the transmission of pain signals, is usually expressed by AŒ¥ and C fibers, but following peripheral nerve damage, substance P is expressed by AŒ≤ fibers. This leads to hyperexcitability of the spinal cord, which usually occurs only in the presence of noxious stimuli. Because patients with complete spinal cord injury have experienced phantom pains, there must be an underlying central mechanism responsible for the generation of phantom pains. =Central mechanisms= Under ordinary circumstances, the genetically determined circuitry in the brain remains largely stable throughout life. It was thought, until about 30 years ago, that no new neural circuits could be formed in the adult mammalian brain. Recently, functional MRI studies in amputees have shown that almost all patients have experienced motor cortical remapping. The majority of motor reorganization has occurred as a downward shift of the hand area of the cortex onto the area of face representation, especially the lips. Sometimes there is a side shift of the hand motor cortex to the ipsilateral cortex. In patients with phantom limb pain, the reorganization was great enough to cause a change in cortical lip representation into the hand areas only during lip movements. It has also been found that there is a high correlation between the magnitude of phantom limb pain and the extent to which the shift of the cortical representation of the mouth into the hand area in motor and somatosensory cortical reorganization has occurred. Additionally, as phantom pains in upper extremity amputees increased, there was a higher degree of medial shift of the facial motor representation. There are multiple theories that try to explain how cortical remapping occurs in amputees, but none have been supported to a great extent. The neuromatrix The neuromatrix theory proposes that there is an extensive network connecting the thalamus and the cortex, and the cortex and the limbic system. It is a theory that extends beyond body schema theory and incorporates the conscious awareness of oneself. This theory proposes that conscious awareness and the perception of self are generated in the brain via patterns of input that can be modified by different perceptual inputs. The network is genetically predetermined, and is modified throughout one‚Äôs lifetime by various sensory inputs to create a neurosignature. It is the neurosignature of a specific body part that determines how it is consciously perceived. The input systems contributing to the neurosignature are primarily the somatosensory, limbic, and thalamocortical systems. The neuromatrix theory aims to explain how certain activities associated with pain lead to the conscious perception of phantom pain. The persistence of the neurosignature, even after limb amputation, may be the cause of phantom sensations and pain. Phantom pain may arise from abnormal reorganization in the neuromatrix to a pre-existing pain state. Opposition to the neuromatrix theory exists largely because it fails to explain why relief from phantom sensations rarely eliminates phantom pains. It also does not address how sensations can spontaneously end and how some amputees do not experience phantom sensations at all. In addition, a major limitation of the neuromatrix theory is that it too broadly accounts for various aspects of phantom limb perception. It is also likely that it is too difficult to be tested empirically, especially when testing painless phantom sensations. Management Various methods have been used to treat phantom limb pain. Doctors may prescribe medications to reduce the pain. Some antidepressants or antiepileptics have been shown to have a beneficial effect on reducing phantom limb pain. Often physical methods such as light massage, electrical stimulation, and hot and cold therapy have been used with variable results. There are many different treatment options for phantom limb pain that are actively being researched. Most treatments do not take into account the mechanisms underlying phantom pains, and are therefore ineffective. However, there are a few treatment options that have been shown to alleviate pain in some patients, but these treatment options usually have a success rate less than 30%. It is important to note that this rate of success does not exceed the placebo effect. It is also important to note that because the degree of cortical reorganization is proportional to phantom limb pains, any perturbations to the amputated regions may increase pain perception. =Mirror therapy= Ramachandran (right) with his original mirror box Mirror box therapy allows for illusions of movement and touch in a phantom limb by inducing somatosensory and motor pathway coupling between the phantom and real limb. Many patients experience pain as a result of a clenched phantom limb, and because phantom limbs are not under voluntary control, unclenching becomes impossible. This theory proposes that the phantom limb feels paralyzed because there is no feedback from the phantom back to the brain to inform it otherwise. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran believes that if the brain received visual feedback that the limb had moved, then the phantom limb would become unparalyzed. Although the use of mirror therapy has been shown to be effective in some cases there is still no widely accepted theory of how it works. According to 2017 paper that reviewed a wide range of studies of mirror therapy, \\"Research evidence suggests that a course of treatment (four weeks) of mirror therapy may reduce chronic pain. Contraindications and side effects are few. The mechanism of action of mirror therapy remains uncertain, with reintegration of motor and sensory systems, restored body image and control over fear-avoidance likely to influence outcome. The evidence for clinical efficacy of mirror therapy is encouraging, but not yet definitive. Nevertheless, mirror therapy is inexpensive, safe and easy for the patient to self-administer.\\"Mirror therapy: A potential intervention for pain management, Wittkopf,Johnson,2017 Nov;63(11): Little research was published on MT before 2009, and much of the research since then has been of low quality. Out of 115 publications between 2012 and 2017 about using mirror therapy to treat phantom limb pain, a 2018 review, found only 15 studies whose scientific results should be considered. From these 15 studies, the reviewers concluded that \\"MT seems to be effective in relieving PLP, reducing the intensity and duration of daily pain episodes. It is a valid, simple, and inexpensive treatment for PLP.\\" =Medication= Pharmacological techniques are often continued in conjunction with other treatment options. Doses of pain medications needed often drop substantially when combined with other techniques, but rarely are discontinued completely. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, and sodium channel blockers, mainly carbamazepine, are often used to relieve chronic pain, and recently have been used in an attempt to reduce phantom pains. Pain relief may also be achieved through use of opioids, ketamine, calcitonin, and lidocaine. =Deep-brain stimulation= Deep brain stimulation is a surgical technique used to alleviate patients from phantom limb pain. Prior to surgery, patients undergo functional brain imaging techniques such as PET scans and functional MRI to determine an appropriate trajectory of where pain is originating. Surgery is then carried out under local anesthetic, because patient feedback during the operation is needed. In the study conducted by Bittar et al., a radiofrequency electrode with four contact points was placed on the brain. Once the electrode was in place, the contact locations were altered slightly according to where the patient felt the greatest relief from pain. Once the location of maximal relief was determined, the electrode was implanted and secured to the skull. After the primary surgery, a secondary surgery under general anesthesia was conducted. A subcutaneous pulse generator was implanted into a pectoral pocket below the clavicle to stimulate the electrode. It was found that all three patients studied had gained satisfactory pain relief from the deep brain stimulation. Pain had not been completely eliminated, but the intensity had been reduced by over 50% and the burning component had completely vanished. Epidemiology Phantom limb pain and phantom limb sensations are linked, but must be differentiated from one another. While phantom limb sensations are experienced by those with congenital limb deficiency, spinal cord injury, and amputation, phantom limb pain occurs almost exclusively as a result of amputation. Almost immediately following the amputation of a limb, 90‚Äì98% of patients report experiencing a phantom sensation. Nearly 75% of individuals experience the phantom as soon as anesthesia wears off, and the remaining 25% of patients experience phantoms within a few days or weeks. Of those experiencing innocuous sensations, a majority of patients also report distinct painful sensations. Age and gender have not been shown to affect the onset or duration of phantom limb pain. Although it has not been fully explored, one investigation of lower limb amputation observed that as stump length decreased, there was a greater incidence of moderate and severe phantom pain.

He was notable for the first hypothesis regarding cellular processes that cause cancer, and for describing chromatin diminution in nematodes. Boveri was married to the American biologist Marcella O'Grady (1863‚Äì1950). Their daughter Margret Boveri (1900‚Äì1975) became one of the best-known post-war German journalists.. Extract published in Work Using a optical microscope, Boveri examined the processes involved in the fertilization of the animal egg cell; his favorite research objects were the nematode Parascaris and sea urchins. Boveri's work with sea urchins showed that it was necessary to have all chromosomes present in order for proper embryonic development to take place. This discovery was an important part of the Boveri‚ÄìSutton chromosome theory. He also discovered, in 1888, the importance of the centrosome for the formation of the spindle during mitosis in animal cells, which he described as the especial organ of cell division. Boveri also discovered the phenomenon of chromatin diminution during embryonic development of the nematode Parascaris. Building on Carl Rabl's knowledge that chromosomes are also present between two nuclear divisions in the cell nucleus, he developed the concept of chromosome individuality, i.e. the assumption that chromosomes retain their individuality during interphase. Through long experiments on sea urchin eggs, he was also able to prove that the various chromosomes contain different genetic makeup. He also reasoned in 1902 that a cancerous tumor begins with a single cell in which the makeup of its chromosomes becomes scrambled, causing the cells to divide uncontrollably. He proposed carcinogenesis was the result of aberrant mitoses and uncontrolled growth caused by radiation, physical or chemical insults or by microscopic pathogens. His assumption was initially rejected by medical professionals; it was only later that researchers such as Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1915 demonstrated that Boveri was correct. Boveri also described the structure of the kidneys in Amphioxus (Cephalochordata).

He also was the first manager in the history of the expansion edition of the Senators (now the Texas Rangers), serving from 1961 through May 21, 1963, and was a coach for four MLB teams between 1960 and 1982. He retired as a player in 1960 with 2,495 hits, and holds the major league record for career double plays at first base (2,044). He has the American League (AL) record for career games (2,227), putouts (19,754), assists (1,444) and total chances (21,408). The lanky Vernon was listed as tall and ; he batted and threw left-handed. Early life Mickey Vernon was born in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, and attended Villanova University, before making his major league debut on July 8, 1939. He was the father of Gay Vernon. During World War II, he served in the United States Navy, missing the 1944 and 1945 seasons. He served with major league players Larry Doby and Billy Goodman on Ulithi in the South Pacific in 1945; both Goodman and Vernon personally inspired Doby to become a major league baseball player; Doby became the first African-American to break the baseball color line in the American League in 1947 with the Cleveland Indians. Baseball career =Playing career= Vernon played for 14 full major league seasons (400 at bats or more) in his 20-year career. He wound up batting over .335 twice, over .300 five times, and over .290 nine times. He was a two-time American League batting champion. In , his .353 batting mark eclipsed Ted Williams' .342 by 11 points. Then, in , Vernon's .337 average denied Cleveland's Al Rosen (.336) the Triple Crown by just one one-thousandth of a point.Goldstein, Richard (14 March 2015), \\"Al Rosen, Who Missed Triple Crown by a Step, Dies at 91.\\" The New York Times The following year, , Vernon had a career high 20 home runs, 97 RBIs, and a career high 14 triples. He led the AL in doubles with a total of 33. He also had 294 total bases, which was second in the AL, behind Minnie Mi√±oso. Over time, Vernon became one of the best-liked ballplayers, mainly through his unique personality and charismatic, but quiet, style. On September 1, 1960, after a season spent as the Pittsburgh Pirates' first-base coach, Vernon was placed on the active list when MLB rosters expanded to 40 men. He appeared in nine regular-season games as a pinch hitter for Pittsburgh, notching an RBI single and an intentional walk in his nine plate appearances to become one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in a major league game in four decades. By his final game played, on September 27, 1960, he was, at 42, the oldest player in the National League by almost a year, and one of the most popular figures in the game. He appeared in 2,409 MLB games without playing in the postseason, third most in history behind Ernie Banks and Luke Appling.Baseball Reference Notably, on September 25, 1960, during Vernon's time on the active list, the Pirates clinched the NL pennant; but he was not on the Pirate playing roster for the 1960 World Series, resuming his full-time coaching duties. He earned a World Series ring when the Bucs triumphed in seven games over the New York Yankees. Vernon posted a career .286 batting average with 172 home runs and 1,311 RBIs in 2,409 games. The left-hander averaged 88 RBIs a year, and had 11 seasons with 80 or more, 3 with 90 or more. He scored 1,196 runs with 137 stolen bases and a .359 on-base percentage. His career slugging percentage was .428, with a career high of .518 in 1953. He compiled 2,495 hits, with 490 doubles and 120 triples, in 8,731 at bats. He had 3,741 career total bases, with his career high coming in 1953 (315). =Coaching and managing= Vernon in 1963 Vernon's career as a coach and manager began during his 1960 stint on the staff of his longtime friend, Pirates' skipper Danny Murtaugh. The following year, in , he returned to Washington when he was named manager of the expansion Senators in their first year of existence. Inheriting the name and home field of the 1901‚Äì60 Washington franchise, now the Minnesota Twins, the expansion Senators were hastily constructed with an undercapitalized ownership, an MLB roster of castoff players,McCue, Andy, and Thompson, Eric (2011), \\"Mismanagement 101: The American League's Expansion of 1961.\\" The National Pastime 2011, Society for American Baseball Research and an almost-nonexistent farm system.

He also managed at the Triple-A and Double-A levels of the minor leagues, and served as a roving batting instructor for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kansas City Royals and Yankees before retiring from baseball.

It is the home field of the Idaho State Bengals of the Big Sky Conference and sits at an elevation of above sea level.USGS topographic map of Holt Arena. MSR Maps. Accessed 6 January 2008. History Originally named the ASISU Minidome‚Äînamed after the Associated Students of Idaho State University, who funded construction‚Äîit opened in 1970 at the north end of the ISU campus. Holt Arena is the oldest enclosed stadium on a college campus in the United States and the second-oldest overall.Facilities - Idaho State University Bengals Accessed 6 January 2008 Only the Houston Astrodome, completed in 1965, predates it. Since the Astrodome's 2006 closure Holt Arena has been the oldest enclosed stadium in use. The original artificial turf installed in 1970 was Poly-Turf. The venue was renamed in 1988 to honor Milton W. \\"Dubby\\" Holt (1914‚Äì2007), ISU's athletic director from 1967 to 1989. As assistant athletic director, Holt conceived the indoor arena in 1966 and it was designed by architect Cedric M. Allen. Although a controversial design proposal for the time, ISU students voted to appropriate not more than $2.8 million to the project two years later. The arena was built entirely with these voluntary student funds.Holt Arena , Idaho Public Television. (accessed 4 September 2013) With over 56% in favor, ISU students approved a $12 increase in semester fees to fund the stadium in early 1968. After 41 football seasons on Poly-Turf and AstroTurf, infilled synthetic turf was installed in Holt Arena in July 2011. Similar to FieldTurf, the SoftTop Removable Matrix SystemISUBengals.com - Hellas Construction to Install New Holt Arena Turf - 2011-06-02 - accessed 2011-09-22 is also installed in AT&T; Stadium in the NFL. Spud Bowl Holt Arena replaced the outdoor \\"Spud Bowl\\" (now Davis Field, at ) as the Bengals' home football stadium in 1970. At the south end of campus, Davis Field continues as the home venue for outdoor track and field and soccer. Additional uses Holt Arena also serves as home for the ISU indoor track and field team and men's basketball team. It also hosts high school football games, the famous Simplot Games high school indoor track meet, along with other sporting events, rodeos, concerts, and other activities. During ISU's run in basketball to the Elite Eight in 1977, they won the Big Sky regular season title, which allowed them to host the four-team conference tournament, which they also won. The Bengals were allowed to stay home for the first round of the 32-team NCAA tournament, as the Minidome had a pair of first round games (sub-regionals) on Saturday, March 12. UCLA defeated Louisville and hometown ISU beat Long Beach State. (Five days later, Idaho State stunned UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen at the West regional in Provo, Utah.) Between the Big Sky tourney and the NCAA games, the venue also hosted the state's three-day A-1 (now 5A) high school championship tournament. Following the success of the Minidome, several other colleges built enclosed stadiums, including the Kibbie Dome at the University of Idaho in Moscow, which was enclosed in 1975 after four years as an outdoor stadium, and the Walkup Skydome at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, opened in 1977. It is one of three indoor football stadiums currently in use in the Big Sky Conference, along with the Kibbie Dome and Walkup Skydome. During the final six seasons of Idaho's absence from Big Sky football (2012‚Äì2017), the Alerus Center at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks was another indoor stadium used in Big Sky football, but UND left the Big Sky after the 2017 football season. Holt Arena features of floor space; the building is recessed below grade and rises above grade at its highest point. Holt Arena hosted the 2018 Convention of the Idaho Republican Party, which was held June 28 through June 30.

History Slam was launched in 1994 as a basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. It was founded by publisher Dennis Page at Harris Publications, and he hired Cory Johnson to be the first Editor in Chief. Its first issue had a cover story on Larry Johnson of the Charlotte Hornets (written by future Fortune editor Andrew Serwer) and a feature on University of California freshman Jason Kidd. Many of the magazine's lasting features, such as In Your Face, Slam-a-da-month, and Last Shot all began with that first issue. Slams ownership has changed several times. Peterson Publishing bought Slam in 1998. The next year, Peterson was acquired by British publisher EMAP. In 2001, EMAP sold its US division to Primedia. When Primedia left the magazine business in 2007, Source Interlink acquired a majority of the company, including Slam. In August 2017. Slam was acquired by an investment group led by Dennis Page (Founder and Publisher) and David Schnur (Executive Publisher). The new holding company is Slam Media Inc. based in New York City. The magazine carries advertising for basketball related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. Slam has published over 200 issues in its history, and has featured the biggest names in basketball on its cover, in articles, and on its famous SLAMups posters. To date, only two female athletes has ever appeared on the Slam cover ‚Äì Chamique Holdsclaw in October 1998 and Maya Moore in the September/October 2018 issue. Kobe Bryant and LeBron James have appeared on a record seventeen covers. \\"A Basketball On Fire\\" was the 1st Slam magazine cover without a player in February 2012.

The idea is that a small body of four or five people is better able to make certain decisions than a large, unwieldy city council. Boards of Control were introduced in many North American municipalities in the early 20th century as a product of the municipal reform movement. They proved unpopular with many as they tended to centralize power in a small body while disempowering city councils. Boards of Control typically consist of the mayor and several Controllers who are elected on a citywide basis as opposed to aldermen who were elected on a ward basis. The Boards were criticized as undemocratic. Boards of Control tended to be less representative of the diverse opinions and communities with majority views among the population being overrepresented. As well, since they were elected by a larger electorate running for a seat on the Board of Control would be prohibitively expensive for many municipal politicians resulting in wealthier politicians being more likely to run for the body. Lastly, Boards of Control tended to meet in camera rather than in open session in the manner of city councils making them less accountable to the public. Because of these problems, many municipalities abolished Boards of Control in the years following World War II. They were maintained in several municipalities in suburban Toronto, Ontario, Canada, into the late 1980s, including North York, Scarborough, York, and Etobicoke. The City of London, Ontario was one of the few remaining municipalities in North America to retain a Board of Control. It was abolished after the 2010 municipal elections.

The September Campaign was the joint Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Free City of Danzig, the Soviet Union, and a small Slovak contingent marking the beginning of WW II in Europe. Tactics and military hardware used in the Invasion of Poland varied between the two sides; The German economy was geared toward military production which supplied their armed forces with equipment that was often superior to their Polish counterparts. Old tactics such as Vernichtungsgedanke and the concept of the Schwerpunkt combined with newly mechanized units punched holes in Polish lines and close air support provided by the world class Luftwaffe disrupted Polish supply and communications lines. Other German tactics included the targeting of civilian targets in terror bombings to inflict huge losses amongst the civilian population, sending streams of refugees out of afflicted areas, thereby hampering Polish logistics. In 1939 the German navy also had an advantage over the tiny Polish fleet. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. The Polish Army had about a million soldiers, but fewer than half had been mobilised by 1 September due to political pressure from France and Britain. The Polish-Soviet War showed Poland the benefits of mobility in military conflicts but Polish officials were unwilling (and unable) to invest heavily to make that a reality. Polish Cavalry Brigades were still effectively used as mobile infantry but in the end fell against German motorized units, however Germany also used cavalry for transportation during the September Campaign. The Polish Air Force lacked modern fighter aircraft for its highly trained pilots, while the Luftwaffe was much more numerous and had superior aircraft. The Polish Navy was a small fleet composed of destroyers and submarines, some of which survived the campaign by escaping to the North Sea to join with the Royal Navy. Germany Germany was only moderately prepared for the invasion of Poland; stocks of ammunition and replacement vehicles, for example, were low, and historians regard Hitler's move as a military gamble as well as a political one. The German economy had for years geared toward production of military equipment and supplies, and was capable of creating an army that could successfully invade its neighbours only if the campaign was not a long one. In fact, in January 1939, while planning for the invasion of Poland was underway, the Wehrmacht's allocation of raw materials was cut, by some 30 percent of steel, 20 percent in copper, 47 percent in aluminum and 14 percent in rubber. Moreover, the German economy was never fully mobilized for war, with Joseph Goebbels belatedly calling for \\"Total War\\" only in 1943. Millions of Reichsmarks went into consumer goods, the female population was never harnessed efficiently for use in war production (James Lucas notes in his book Reich that 1 million German women were employed as hairdressers as late as 1943 instead of in armaments or war related industry), and many workers in the German war economy later in the war were unwilling slave labourers. As early as 1940, British production \\"though still lackadaisical, outstripped that of Germany in aircraft, tanks and heavy guns, in everything in fact except equipment for a large army.\\" (A.J.P. Taylor, The Second World War, 1975). The Polish Campaign, and the spectre of war with Britain and France, did not change things. Walter Warlimont, who headed the Department of Home Defence for the Wehrmacht, wrote postwar: > In the fact of the successful Polish campaign, Hitler (still) refused to > order mobilisation in the full sense of the word; later on, partial > mobilisation was ordered, but the economy was specifically exempted...None > of the carefully thought-out measures designed to protect the armament > industry by keeping its skilled workers on the job was put into effect. > (Quoted in Brute Force (Ellis, Viking Penguin, 1990)) =Wehrmacht= Panzer I tank Panzer IV tank The German military was collectively known as the Wehrmacht, and all three components had separate but related roles to play in the campaign. The firepower of a German infantry division far exceeded that of a Polish (as well as French and British) infantry division. The standard Heer infantry division on the eve of the Second World War included 442 machine guns, 135 mortars, 72 antitank guns, and 24 howitzers. Germany had not only a large numerical advantage over Polish forces, but their organisation and command structure was much more efficient. While German forces were not as mobile or numerous as they would be in the later stages of the Second World War, the Wehrmacht had some 2,400 tanks organized into six armoured (panzer) divisions using operational doctrine developed during and after the First World War, coupled with older concepts such as Vernichtungsgedanken. German tanks of this period Panzer I, Panzer II, Panzer III and the most advanced Panzer IV. In accordance with the ideas of Heinz Guderian, German tanks and mechanized support units (motorized artillery, etc.) were used in massive, mechanized spearhead (Schwerpunkt) attacks, serving as highly mobile units to punch holes in the enemy line and isolate selected enemy units, which the infantry would then encircle and destroy while the armored and mechanized forces pushed forward to repeat the process, eventually breaking through enemy frontlines and then dispersing, causing confusion in the rear areas and severing lines of supply and communication. The 1939 Kavallerie Waffen-SS in Poland Less mobile mechanized infantry and regular infantry (who, along with their horse-drawn artillery support, vastly outnumbered their mechanized comrades) would then in theory follow-up the panzer divisions' penetration into enemy territory. The Heer was closely supported by the Luftwaffe, especially by dive bombers that attacked and disrupted the enemy's supply and communications lines and spread panic and confusion in its rear, thus further paralyzing the enemy's defensive capabilities. Mechanization was the key to this German tactic first revealed in the September Campaign and nicknamed blitzkrieg (lightning war) by contemporary journalists, who found the name fitting because of the unprecedented speed and mobility that were its underlying characteristics. Despite the term blitzkrieg being coined by the Allies during the Polish September Campaign of 1939, historians (such as Matthew Cooper) generally hold that German operations in Poland were more traditional than revolutionary. Cooper, for one, writes (in The German Army (1976)) that Heer strategy was more inline with Vernichtungsgedanken, or a focus on envelopment to create pockets in broad-front annihilation. Mechanized forces were deployed among the three German concentrations without strong emphasis on independent use, being used to create or destroy close pockets of Polish forces and seize operational-depth terrain in support of the largely unmotorized infantry which followed. Luftwaffe Aircraft (particularly fighter and ground attack aircraft) played a major role in the fighting. Bomber aircraft purposely attacked cities and civilian targets causing huge losses amongst the civilian population in what became known as terror bombings. The Luftwaffe forces consisted of 1,180 fighter aircraft (mainly Bf 109s), 290 Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers, 290 conventional bombers (mainly of the He 111 and Do 17 types), and an assortment of 240 naval aircraft. In total, Germany had close to 3,000 aircraft (~2,000 of them can be considered militarily modern) with half of them deployed on the Polish front. Bf 109E, advanced German fighter The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, was also the best force of its kind in 1939. It was designed to support the army, but in air combat the German planes were superior to most designs fielded by the Allies. In the rearmament period from 1935 to 1939, the production of German combat aircraft steadily mounted, and the standardization of engines and airframes gave the Luftwaffe a repair and production advantage over its opponents. Kriegsmarine At sea, the odds against the German Kriegsmarine were less favorable. They were much worse in September 1939 than in August 1914, as the Allies had many more large surface warships than Germany. However, the naval theater, for Germany, was of least significance. During the entire war there was to be no major encounter between the Allied and the German surface fleets, nothing that resembled the battle of Jutland from the previous war. Kriegsmarine activities saw only the individual operation of German pocket battleships and commerce raiders, with the rare exceptions of operations like the Operation Rhein√ºbung, and submarine-driven Battle of the Atlantic. That noted, in 1939 Germany did have an advantage over the tiny Polish fleet, and the Western Allies were unwilling and unprepared to challenge the Kriegsmarine on the small, land-locked Baltic Sea. Poland Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in industrialization of the Centralny Okrƒôg Przemys≈Çowy, chosen for being reasonably far from both the Soviet and German frontiers. That heavy spending on military industry pushed much of the spending on actual weapons into 1940‚Äì42. Poland had been preparing for defensive war for many years; however, most plans assumed German aggression would not happen before 1942. Polish military industry development and fortifications were scheduled to be completed in that year, and newer tanks and aircraft were just entering production or would shortly. Starting in September 1936, France loaned Poland 2.6 billion francs over a 5-year period, which added 12% to the annual Polish military budget. The Polish defense budget for 1938‚Äì39 was 800 million z≈Çoty, of which: * Armored force‚Äî13.7 million * Artillery‚Äî16 million * Air Force‚Äî46.3 million * Navy‚Äî21.7 million * Cavalry‚Äî58 million To raise funds for industrial development, Poland was selling much of the modern equipment it produced; for example, anti-tank guns were sold to Britain and planes were exported to Greece. =Polish Army= Polish Bofors AA gun and a bombed column of Polish Army during the battle of Bzura TKS tankette 7TP, a Polish modern light tank The Polish Army was fairly strong in numbers (~1 million soldiers), but much of it was not mobilised by 1 September, as the Polish government, advised in this by the British and French governments, constantly hoped that the war could be resolved (at least for the time being) through diplomatic channels. Less than half of the Polish armed forces had been mobilized by 1 September, and only one-quarter (250,000) were fully equipped and in assigned positions when hostilities commenced. Thus many soldiers, mobilised after 1 September, failed to reach the designated staging areas and, together with normal civilians, sustained significant casualties when public transport (trains and roads filled with refugees) became targets of the German Air Force. Poland possessed numerically inferior armoured forces, and they were dispersed within the infantry and unable to effectively engage in any major armoured battles. The Germans opposing them had close to 3,000 tanks organised into independent divisions under blitzkrieg doctrine. In terms of equipment, the Poles had 132 of their own 7TP tanks, which were capable of destroying any German armour, including their heaviest Panzer IV, and had a few relatively modern imported designs, such as 50 Renault R35 tanks and 38 Vickers E tanks. Of the 700 odd tanks remaining, 102 were obsolete First World War Renault FT tanks and, not much better than armoured cars, 300 TK-3 and 274 TKS tankettes. In addition to tanks, Poland successfully used 10 regular armoured trains against German forces, which were unprepared to face this kind of combat vehicle considered in 1939 so obsolete by German planners to be given any serious consideration. Although the trains proved indeed vulnerable to air attack, losses incurred against Polish trains (\\"≈ömia≈Çy\\" Armored Train destroyed nearly 100 German tanks during the battles around Mokra village) convinced the Germans to reintroduce this type of vehicle into their own army after the September Campaign. Experience in the Polish-Soviet War (1919‚Äì1921), the only recent, major conflict the independent Second Polish Republic took part in, shaped Polish Army organisational and operational doctrine. Unlike the First World War, this was a conflict in which the cavalry's mobility played a decisive role. Thus the Polish high command drew a lesson different from both the Western Allies and Germany with their western front experience. With their victory in the First World War, France and Britain remained conservative and expected the new conflict to be another of trench warfare. German military theories were based upon the notion that successful offenses would be based on new inventions‚Äîtanks and planes. Poland stood in the middle: acknowledging the benefits of mobility but unwilling (and unable) to invest heavily in the expensive and unproven new inventions, it turned to cavalry, which the Polish Army considered its elite corps. During the September Campaign, the Polish Cavalry would prove to be much more successful than anybody, the Germans included, could have anticipated. Polish Cavalry brigades were used as a mobile infantry and were quite successful against German infantry. Cavalry charges were rare but successful, especially when used against infantry in un-entrenched positions. However, while Polish cavalry matched German panzers in speed and anti-infantry effectiveness, in the end it simply could not stand its ground against tanks. Among the interesting equipment Polish forces used with success was the 7.92 mm Karabin przeciwpancerny wz.35 anti-tank rifle. It was quite successful against German light tanks, although, as with most of modern Polish equipment, production was just beginning when the war started, and thus wasn't fielded in numbers large enough to significantly change the outcome of the war. * Tanks ** TK-3 and TKS, tankettes ** 7TP, a light tank * Anti-tank gun ** Bofors wz.37 =Polish Air Force= Lublin R-XIIID PZL.23A Kara≈õ on the Warsaw Airport. Note lines of PZL P.11 or PZL P.7 fighters in the background PZL.37, modern Polish bomber The Polish Air Force was at a severe disadvantage against the Luftwaffe. Although its pilots were highly trained, the Polish Air Force lacked modern fighter aircraft, and the Germans had gross numerical superiority: Poland had approximately 400 modern and semi-modern aircraft (and another 400 obsolete transport, recon and training aircraft), including 169 fighters, and Germany had approximately 3,000 aircraft (albeit only half that number on the Polish front, with most of the remaining similarly as obsolete as the second 400 Polish aircraft). The Polish Air Force development program was slowed in 1926 in the aftermath of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's May coup d'√©tat, as Pi≈Çsudski considered the air force to be of less importance than other military branches. In 1939, the Polish main fighter, the PZL P.11, designed in the early 1930s, was becoming obsolete. The slightly better PZL P.24 was used solely for export, and PZL.50s and several other projects, which were supposed to have better parameters than contemporary German fighters, were still during prototype's tests. As a result, the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters were faster and better-armed than anything the Poles had in 1939, and most German bombers could also outrun the Polish fighters. On the other hand, P.11s were more maneuverable, and despite the German superiority in speed, armament and numbers, P.11s downed a considerable number of German aircraft, including fighters. The exact numbers are not verified, but some sources claim that at least one German aircraft was shot down for each P.11 lost (a figure of 107 to 141 German aircraft shot down for the loss of 118 Polish aircraft is most often given). One of the most interesting units in the Polish Air Force arsenal was the PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ twin-engine medium bomber. Before the war it was one of the world's most modern and outstanding bombers. Smaller than most contemporary medium bombers, it was still able to carry a heavier bomb load than comparable aircraft, including the famous Vickers Wellington. It was relatively fast and easy to handle, and thanks to a landing gear with double wheels, it could operate from rough fields or meadows. The only drawback was its relatively weak defensive armament, consisting of 3 machine guns. Its range was also limited, but the ≈Åo≈õ was not meant to be a long-range bomber. During the September Campaign, despite their good performance, they were too few in number to change the outcome and, often lacking fighter cover, sustained heavy losses, especially when used to attack armoured columns. Few Polish Air Force planes were destroyed on the ground as most had been deployed to temporary, secret airstrips. The fighter planes were grouped in 15 escadres. Five of them constituted the Pursuit Brigade (Brygada Po≈õcigowa), deployed in the Warsaw area. The bombers, grouped in 9 escadres of the Bomber Brigade (Brygada Bombowa), attacked armoured columns, suffering heavy losses. Seven reconnaissance and 12 observation escadres, attached to various Polish Armies, were intensively used for reconnaissance. However, the Polish pilots, while highly trained and motivated, faced a numerically superior opponent in superior designs with a much better command structure. Germany achieved air superiority around day three of the campaign, although the Polish Air Force managed to remain operational for the first two weeks of the September Campaign. At that point, the Polish Air Force ceased to exist as a fighting force, as most of its planes were either destroyed in combat or, facing rapidly advancing German troops, had to be abandoned on the ground due to lack of supplies and spare parts. A few remaining aircraft were either captured by the Germans or withdrawn to Romania and taken over by that country. A great number of pilots and air crews managed to break through to France and later Britain through various routes. * Aircraft: ** PZL P.7, fighter ** PZL P.11, fighter ** PZL.23 Kara≈õ, light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft ** PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ, twin-engine medium bomber ** Lublin R-XIII, observation, close reconnaissance and army cooperation plane, ** RWD-14 Czapla, observation, close reconnaissance and army cooperation plane ** RWD-8, training and liaison aircraft =Polish Navy= ORP B≈Çyskawica, Polish destroyer The Polish Navy was a small fleet composed of destroyers and submarines.

Soviet Union Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had negotiated about the upcoming invasion of Poland prior to signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The Soviet Union had been promised half of Poland if they helped the Germans to conquer the country. In the event, the German invasion began on 1 September 1939 but the Soviet Union held back until 17 September. When the Soviets attacked, Polish forces were forming a bridgehead in south-eastern Poland where they intended to make a last stand against the Germans - and if overwhelmed, to cross the border into Romania and make their way to the west to continue the fight from there. The Soviet invasion of Poland not only wrecked this plan, but also forced the Polish government to leave the country. The Polish government had relocated to the south-eastern town of Kuty on 17 September 1939 and held a cabinet meeting at 4pm, in full knowledge that Soviet forces were advancing rapidly towards them. It was concluded that they should cross the border into Romania, and from there go on to France. Most of Poland's highest government officials evacuated to Romania on the night of 17‚Äì18 September. The Soviet invasion destroyed the possibility of any further coordinated military action by Poland against the Germans. Nevertheless, the Poles kept on fighting - the last significant battle which organised Polish forces took part in was at Kock, which ended on 6 October. The Polish government refused to surrender or negotiate a peace, and instead ordered all units to evacuate Poland with the aim of eventually reorganising in France. The Soviet invaders were met with only sporadic resistance, most notably in the Battle of Szack when Polish artillery wiped out an entire brigade of Soviet tanks. The Soviet Union lost 1,500 men during the invasion. :See also: * Soviet invasion of Poland * Soviet order of battle for invasion of Poland in 1939 Slovakia Slovakia had an army at only six months old, but when Germany asked the Slovaks to help attack Poland, they agreed. They sent an army group, called Field Army Bernol√°k under the command of Slovak General Ferdinand Catlos. Their campaign began on September first, 1939. They occupied the Polish town of Tatranska Javorina and several other Polish areas (which are still part of Slovakia today.) They only faced one Polish force, the Karpaty Army. At the end of their attack, they had occupied much of Southern Poland with the cost of only 37 men killed and 114 men wounded. :Also see Slovak invasion of Poland Notes and references * *Michael Alfred Peszke, Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II, McFarland & Company, 2004, , Google Print, p.2 *Telegram: His Majesty's Ambassador in Berlin. \\"Wehrmacht forces available to Britain.\\" Text version, original document. *Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government Cited in the British Blue Book. * Category:Invasion of Poland ","title":"Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign"},{"id":"1918141","text":"(born October 14, 1950 in Kobe, Japan) is a jazz musician and performer, most known for his contributions to the soundtracks of the Lupin III anime series.

John Alan Glennon (born September 24, 1970) is an American geographer and explorer. His work has been mapping and describing caves and geysers. Discoveries and research =Caves= In 1996, Glennon and Jon Jasper discovered an entrance to the Martin Ridge Cave System, Kentucky, and explored connections to nearby Jackpot and Whigpistle Caves (Groves, C.G. 1998). The combined cave system is long (Gulden, B. 2005). The cave is hydrologically connected to Mammoth Cave---the world's longest cave (Quinlan J.F. and Ray, J. 1989). Glennon also was involved in the discovery of one of the largest cave chambers in Kentucky (Yonker, R. 2003). =Geysers= In 2002, Glennon led an American expedition to El Tatio Geyser Field, Chile. The team produced the first comprehensive inventory and description of the geysers' behaviors. The resulting report concluded that the site was the world's third largest geyser field (Glennon, J.A. and Pfaff, R.M. 2003). =Hoffman Environmental Research Institute (HERI)= With Dr. Chris Groves, president of the Cave Research Foundation (2004-2006), Glennon cofounded HERI in 1999. The Institute's mission is to study the environmental and geologic aspects of caves and karst landscapes. Headquartered at Western Kentucky University, HERI's major scientific focus has been on the karst issues of China. Background Glennon was a geography Ph.D. student of Dr. Michael Frank Goodchild at the University of California, Santa Barbara and received his PhD in 2013. Goodchild is a pioneer in Geographic Information Science and discoverer of Castleguard Cave, Canada's longest cave. Glennon received a Master of Science in Geoscience from Western Kentucky University, 2001, and Bachelor of Science in Park Administration from Texas A&M; University, 1994. For his cave discoveries in Kentucky, Alan has been commissioned in the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels. Works authored *Glennon, J.A., Pfaff, R.M. (2005).

It is in the Gulf of Thailand off the coastline of the Thai province of Rayong, approximately southeast of Bangkok. Ko Samet is part of the Phe () Subdistrict of the Amphoe Mueang Rayong (, the capital district, or Amphoe Mueang), of Rayong Province. Ko Samet is the largest and westernmost of a cluster of islands not far from the coast. Ko Samet measures from north to south. At its closest point to the mainland, the island is south of mainland Rayong Province; however the actual travelling distance from the main commercial tourist pier in the town of Phe to the island's closest tourist beach is about . Popular with foreign tourists and as a weekend getaway for residents of nearby Bangkok, most of the island (excluding the Na Dan area) is in the Khao Laem Ya‚ÄìMu Ko Samet National Park. In 1981, the Royal Forest Department declared the archipelago of Samet, along with nine other small islands, the headland of Khao Laem Ya, and the Mae Ramphueng Beach to be a national park, and thus Ko Samet is under the protection of the National Parks Division of the Thai government. History The Thai government restricted overnight stay on the island until 1981 (even though Bangkokians had known of the beauty of Ko Samet for decades). In that year, on 1 October, the Forestry Department of Thailand declared Ko Samet and environs to be a national park. Geography and climate Located 220 km from the capital in the Gulf of Thailand, Ko Samet is approximately in size, and shaped somewhat like the letter \\"t\\". Along the length of the \\"t\\" (north-south) the island measures approximately 7 km, and measures 4 km across the \\"t\\" (west-east). Forests blanket up to 80 percent of the total area. Closest to the mainland, lies the small island port village of Na Dan, commonly known as Ko Samet Village, with its nearby beach, Hat Sai Kaeo (Glass Sand Beach; ), the longest beach on Ko Samet. Most of Ko Samet's beaches lie along the eastern shore of the island. Other beaches on the island include: Ao Phai, Ao Wai, Ao Kio Na Nai, Ao Cho, Ao Kio Na Nok, Ao Wong Duean, Cape Kut, Ao Toei, and Ao Karang at the southern tip, and Ao Phrao on the western shore of the island. Just off the southern tip of the island are three small rock-islands, Ko Chan (Moon Island; ), Ko San Chalam (Shark Fin Island), and Hin Khao (White Rock; ). Ko Samet is one of the driest archipelagos in Thailand. Ko Samet gets significantly less rainfall than Rayong Province, even though it is only a few kilometres offshore. The island's \\"rainy season\\" extends only from May to July, but even during this season it has less rain than other islands in Thailand. The island, despite being arid, consists of lush forested hills, covered with evergreen and deciduous forest and cajeput trees grow abundantly (the name \\"samet\\" means \\"cajeput\\"). Owing to the lack of rain, Ko Samet must import potable water from the mainland. Administration Ko Samet is administered by the Phe Sub- district, Mueang Rayong District, Rayong Province. Ko Samet is also under the aegis of the national park area (Khao Laem Ya‚ÄìMu Ko Samet National Park), and all foreign visitors are required to pay a 200 baht (approximately US$5.60) entry fee upon arrival. Transport There are two main arteries on Ko Samet: the northern route connects Hat Sai Kaeo to Ao Klang and Ao Noina. The central route consists of four smaller roads. The first road links Sai Kaeo beach to Ao Phai and Ao Phutsa. The second road connects the center of island to Ao Wong Duean. The third road connects the first road to Ao Thapthim and Ao Nuan. The fourth road connects the first road to Ao Phrao. Songthaews are the chief means of public transport. There are five piers: Ao Klang, Ao Phrao, Ao Wong Duean, Ao Thian, and Ao Wai. Ao Klang Pier is the port to mainland. The rest are piers for diving and excursions. In popular culture Statue of Aphai Mani and mermaid, Hat Sai Kaeo Beach. During the 19th century the poet Sunthorn Phu (1786‚Äì1855), set part of his epic work, Phra Aphai Mani (sometimes transliterated as Pra Apaimanee), on the shores of the island. Statues of the title character, Prince Aphai Mani and the siren/mermaid which guided him to Ko Samet can be found on Hat Sai Kaeo Beach.

It was also in charge of regulating seminaries, which prepare those students intending to become priests (seminarians) for ordination to the presbyterate, until 16 January 2013 when Pope Benedict XVIApostolic Letter (Motu proprio) Ministrorum institutio transferred the oversight of seminaries and all other related formation programs for priests and deacons from this dicastery to the Congregation for the Clergy, which regulates deacons and priests generally, not only their education. The Congregation for Catholic Education retains responsibility for matters pertaining to the structure of seminary curricula in philosophy and theology, in consultation with the Congregation for the Clergy.Apostolic Letter (Motu proprio) Ministrorum institutio History Pope Sixtus V created the forerunner of the Congregation in 1588 with the Constitution Immensa, to oversee the University of Rome La Sapienza and other notable universities of the time, including Bologna, Paris, and Salamanca. In 1824 Pope Leo XII created the Congregatio studiorum for educational institutions in the Papal States, which in 1870 began to oversee Catholic universities. Pope Saint Pius X confirmed this responsibility in 1908 and Pope Benedict XV erected in 1915 the section for seminaries (which existed within the Consistorial Congregation), joined to it the Congregatio studiorum, and called it Congregatio de Seminariis et Studiorum Universitatibus. In 1967, Pope Paul VI renamed it Sacra Congregatio pro institutione Catholica.

History Kingston, South Australia was established in the 1800s by Archibald, his brother James Cooke and James' wife Mrs. Mary Macpherson Cooke. Much later a Sir George Strickland Kingston, a South Australian politician, surveyor and architect was chosen, for the co- incidence of his name, to open the Kingston Post Office on 9 February 1869. The extension on its name is to distinguish Kingston in the South East (of South Australia) from another 'Kingston' in the state which is now officially named \\"Kingston On Murray\\". The extension was added in July 1940. The present- day town of Kingston SE includes the original Kingston, as well as the towns of Port Caroline and Maria Creek. The town was connected to Naracoorte by a railway known as the Kingston-Naracoorte railway in 1876, providing a port for the grain and wool grown away from the coast. The rails were converted to broad gauge with a new station built on the edge of town in 1959.

The son of Gertrude Corbett and Edward D. Shea, he was born in St. John's and was educated there and at Ampleforth College in England. He was married twice: first to Louisa Catherine Pinsent in 1888 and then to Margaret Rendell in 1900. In 1870, Shea became a clerk in the family business, Shea and Company. The company was shipping agent for the Allan Line of Royal Mail Steamships and the Ross Steamship Line. In 1887, when his uncle Ambrose Shea was appointed governor of the Bahamas, George replaced him as the firm's managing partner. He was later an agent for the North British Mercantile Insurance Company and a member of the Newfoundland Board of Revenue. In 1885, Shea ran for the Ferryland seat in the Newfoundland assembly as a Liberal; his father had also represented Ferryland in the assembly. He was elected by acclamation as a supporter of Ambrose Shea, who led the Catholic-Liberal party in a highly sectarian contest. Shea was re-elected as an independent in 1889, but was defeated by Liberal candidates Michael Cashin and Daniel J. Greene in 1893. Again elected to the Newfoundland assembly for Ferryland in 1897, Shea served for two years as minister without portfolio in the government of Sir James Spearman Winter. He did not run for reelection to the assembly in 1900. In 1902 Shea was elected as the first mayor of St. John's. During his term, he improved the water system and helped bring the city's finances under control. Shea served as mayor until 1906, when he was defeated by lawyer Michael Gibbs. He had meanwhile re-entered the House of Assembly in 1904 as the Liberal representative for the district of St. John's East. He served as minister without portfolio in the government of Sir Robert Bond from 1904 to 1909 and was re-elected in 1908 and 1909. After Bond decided against a return to politics in 1917 and 1918, Shea endorsed Richard Squires and the Liberal Reform Party. Shea retired from business in 1919 and the following year was appointed by Squires to the Legislative Council. He occasionally served as acting Prime Minister in Squire's absence. He also served on the board of governors of the Newfoundland Savings Bank and as chair of the Permanent Marine Disasters Fund Committee. Shea died in St. John's at the age of 81.

The surrounding Clearwater County's administration office is located in Rocky Mountain House.  History  Rocky Mountain Fort in 1848 by Paul Kane Ruins of Rocky Mountain House in 1884 (photo by James Williams Tyrrell) The town has a long history dating to the 18th century with the presence of British and Canadian fur traders during the westward Canadian expansion. In 1799, the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company each established the Rocky Mountain House and Acton House fur trading posts. Trade with the local aboriginal peoples continued until 1821 when the companies merged, they continued to trade until 1875 and closed the Rocky Mountain House post. The name of the settlement however remained. The Rocky Mountain House settlement also served as a launching point for many explorers such as David Thompson, in search for a passage west to the Pacific Ocean. Many travellers used this location as a stop on their way further west or northwest, just as they do into the 21st century. The next wave of adventurers entered the region at the beginning of the 20th century in search of opportunities presented by lush farmland and the abundance of natural resources. Rocky Mountain House became a firmly established town by 1912. Settlers of Scandinavian origin made up a significant part of early 20th century settlement in the region. = Fur trade = Rocky Mountain House and Acton House were a pair of fur trade posts from 1799 to 1876. Rocky Mountain House belonged to the North West Company (NWC) and Acton House to the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). When the two companies merged in 1821, the name Rocky Mountain House was retained. The posts were opened and closed seven times. Rocky Mountain House was the westernmost post on the North Saskatchewan and was within sight of the Rocky Mountains. The fort facilitated trade with the Blackfeet and Piegans as well as the Kootenays across the mountains. The Kootenays were prevented from reaching Fort Edmonton by the Blackfeet and Piegans who wanted to profit as middlemen and keep them from getting guns. The fort also served as a base for finding a pass across the Rocky Mountains. The post also produced pemmican and York boats. The posts were built at the confluence of the Clearwater River and the North Saskatchewan River. They were on the north bank just above the Clearwater and strongly built for protection from the Blackfeet. During low water there were rapids near the post. Around 1980, only two stone chimneys were standing. An interpretive centre was subsequently developed at this location. ;Timeline *1790: Peter Pangman of the North West Company marked the site for the future company fort. *1799-1802: In September 1799, a group of Nor'Westers (North West Company employees) under John McDonald of Garth travelled upstream of Fort Augustus by canoe and horseback and established Rocky Mountain House. James Bird of the HBC followed and built Acton House. David Thompson and Duncan McGillivray of the NWC were wintering partners at their House. The Kootenays did not cross the mountains in significant numbers and attempts to find a pass failed. Therefore, both posts were closed in 1802. *1805-1807: The two posts were reopened without much success. In 1807, David Thompson of the NWC went up the North Saskatchewan, found Howse Pass and built Kootenay House on the Columbia River. The new post made Rocky Mountain House unnecessary and the posts were closed again in 1807. *1810-1812: Reopened in 1810, Alexander Henry 'The Younger' of the NWC found that the route over the mountains was blockaded by the Piegans. He and David Thompson set out overland north to the Athabasca River. After ascending it for five days, they abandoned their horses for snowshoes to cross Athabasca Pass for the first time and reached the Columbia River at Boat Encampment. Athabasca Pass was clearly superior and attempts to reach the Columbia shifted north. In 1811, a group of Gros Ventres planned to attack the fort but were threatened away by the Piegans who preferred to trade at Rocky Mountain House rather than at Fort Edmonton near their Cree enemies. The two posts were then closed to consolidate trade at Fort Edmonton. *1819-1823: Attempts to get the Blackfeet to trade at Fort Edmonton failed so the forts were reopened. With John Rowland in charge for the NWC, the two companies were merged in 1821 and the combined fort was called Rocky Mountain House. In 1823, George Simpson decided to close the post since there were few beaver and the post was losing money. *1825-1832: The post was reopened at Piegan request, and it prospered due to a new source of beaver. In the winter of 1830-31, a group of Piegans were attacked by the Crows, who killed 57 Piegans and stole all their furs. After this disaster and the opening of a closer American post, the Piegans stopped trading and the post was closed again in 1832. *1835-1861: A new post was built to the south somewhere on the Bow River in the Piegan country, which failed after two years. In 1835, J. E. Harriott built a new post down the river but in sight of the old post, where it remained as a wintering post for 26 years. The Piegan trade having been lost to the Americans, the HBC tried to concentrate the Blackfoot trade at Rocky Mountain House away from their enemies at Fort Edmonton. With the escalating violence on the frontier, the HBC decided to stop the liquor trade. In retaliation, the Blackfeet refused to trade and prevented buffalo hunters from leaving the fort. With starvation a real possibility, no one was sent upriver in the fall of 1861 to trade. Finding the fort empty, the Blackfeet burnt it to the ground. *1864-1876: Gold was discovered in Montana and the American traders shifted their attention from Indians to prospectors. The HBC reasoned that this made a new opportunity for the Indian trade and a new Rocky Mountain House was built next to the ruins of the old one. The trade did not prosper because the Blackfeet preferred the Americans' whiskey which they got from places like Fort Whoop-up. Arriving in 1874, the North-West Mounted Police drove out the American whiskey traders, and the HBC built a new post somewhere to the south making Rocky Mountain House redundant. It was closed permanently in 1876.  Geography  The North Saskatchewan River borders Rocky Mountain House to the west where the Clearwater River flows into the North Saskatchewan River. Crimson Lake is a lake approximately northwest of town. Crimson Lake is home to Crimson Lake Provincial Park. = Climate = Rocky Mountain House has a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfc) that borders on a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb). Daytime temperatures are in general representative for the latter, but the larger diurnal temperature variation with the high elevation ensures frequent frosts. The January average high of around is actually much milder than clear continental areas further east in Canada on similar and lower parallels. The highest temperature ever recorded in Rocky Mountain House was on 23 July 1928.Environment Canada - Canadian Climate Data‚ÄîDaily Data Report for July 1928, accessed 19 September 2016 The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 12 February 1936.Environment Canada - Canadian Climate Data‚ÄîDaily Data Report for February 1936, accessed 19 September 2016  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Rocky Mountain House recorded a population of 6,635 living in 2,599 of its 2,954 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 6,933. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. The Town of Rocky Mountain House's 2012 municipal census counted a population of 7,300, a 1.0% increase over its 2007 municipal census population of 7,231. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Rocky Mountain House had a population of 6,933 living in 2,651 of its 2800 total dwellings, a 0.9% change from its 2006 population of 6,874. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Economy  The economy of the Rocky Mountain House area is driven by petroleum, agriculture, and forestry. Tourism also plays a role in its economy due to its location at the crossroads of Highway 22 and Highway 11, and its location midway between Red Deer and the scenic Alberta's Rockies region. Transportation On the road, Rocky Mountain House is served by Highway 22 and Highway 11. In the air, Rocky Mountain House is served by its airport.  Sports  The Recreation, Parks & Community Services Department hosts five annual sports tournaments. They include two slo-pitch, a sno-pitch, a volleyball and a hockey/slo-pitch combined tournament.  Government  Rocky Mountain House's town council consists of Mayor Tammy Burke and councillors Jason Alderson, Merrin Fraser, Len Phillips, Michelle Narang, Randy Brown and Scott Collinson. Rocky Mountain House is located within the Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre provincial electoral district, which is represented by Jason Nixon of the United Conservative Party.[20] Twin town Rocky Mountain House is twinned with Kamikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1971 to 1984 and also served as leader of the Alberta NDP from 1968 to 1984. Early life Notley was born in Didsbury, Alberta, the son of Francis (Grant) and James Walter Notley, who were farmers. He graduated from the University of Alberta in 1960 with a history degree. After having been involved with the Alberta New Democratic Party in campus politics, he became the party's provincial secretary in 1962. Political career Notley ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1963 as a candidate for the Alberta NDP. He was easily defeated, finishing last in the four-way race losing to incumbent Edgar Gerhart. He also ran 1967 provincial elections, and in a 1969 by-election. Notley was elected leader of the Alberta NDP in 1968. Notley ran in the 1971 provincial election, he won a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the electoral district of Spirit River- Fairview defeating incumbent Adolph Fimrite. He served as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Spirit River-Fairview, and was, for eleven years, the sole NDP MLA in the provincial legislature. In the 1982 provincial election, he was joined by a second NDP MLA, Ray Martin, and the NDP was named the Official Opposition. Notley spent his political career energetically building the social democratic NDP into a potent force in one of Canada's most conservative provinces. Death On October 19, 1984, Notley and five other passengers were killed near Slave Lake in northern Alberta when Wapiti Aviation Flight 402 crashed into a snow-covered, wooded hillside. Four people survived the crash, including then Minister of Housing, Larry Shaben. A year after Notley's death, his party achieved a breakthrough. In the 1986 provincial election, the NDP, for the first time, won 16 seats and 29 percent of the vote. Personal life Notley's daughter, Rachel Notley, served as MLA (NDP) for the provincial riding of Edmonton Strathcona, from the 2008 provincial election to the present.

In the , Mitchelton had a population of 8,559 people. Geography The suburb is located by road from the Brisbane central business district. Mitchelton is part of the northwestern suburbs. It is a growing suburb with many Queenslander style houses and leafy streets. The area is quite hilly and most of the suburb is on a north-facing slope. History Mitchelton is an area with a long history. Mitchelton's name comes from one particular family of the first settlers in the area. The Mitchell family emigrated from England in the 1850s. Nicholas Mitchell purchased an estate he named \\"Mitchelton\\" by 1875. This area was first subdivided in the 1890s. St Matthews Church of England was built from 1867 to 1869. The church and its cemetery are at 35 Church Road (). It was designed by Charles Tiffin. On 4 October 1913, Arthur Blackwood sold a large portion of land known as the Oxford Park Estate between Samford Road and Kedron Brook. It was a subdivision of 300 suburban allotments (mostly 32 perches) and 8 larger farm allotments on St Helens Road fronting Kedron Brook. The estate created Blackwood Street and University Road (the northern part of which is now Pascoe Road). One of the advertised benefits of the estate were its proximity to the proposed Groveley railway station on the Ferny Grove railway line. The estate gave its name to the Oxford Park railway station, despite the railway station being to the west of the estate, which resulted in land near that railway station being commonly known as Oxford Park (although that land never formed part of the Oxford Park subdivision). Grovely State School opened on 9 October 1916. It was renamed Mitchelton State School in 1923. (It is not to be confused with the present day Grovely State School in Keperra, which opened in 1956). In June 1922, Grovely Lodge Estate, 3rd section, made up of 149 residential sites and 4 large blocks, were advertised by Cameron Bros Auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states that the estate is 5 minutes walk to both Mitchelton railway station and state school. The first section of Mitchelton View Estate was offered for sale in 1926 by B.F. Caniffe. In May 1933, B.F. Caniffe auctioned 50 suburban blocks, the third section of the Mitchelton View Estate. The subdivision was bounded by Gizerah Street, Taylors Road, Frasers Road and Mashobra Street. However, the bidding did not reach the reserve price and the blocks were not sold. In 1930 the Sisters of the Good Shepherd established the Good Shepherd Home for girls with special needs or those deemed to be \\"uncontrollable\\" in their own homes; these girls worked in the home's commercial laundry. The home was closed in late 1974 due to changes in community and government expectations about institutionalised care of children. in January 1949 the Sisters of the Good Samaritan opened Our Lady of Dolours Catholic School at the request of James Duhig, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, with 69 students and two sisters as teachers. Mitchelton Infants State School opened on 29 January 1952; it closed 1 January 1986. Mitchelton State High School opened on 31 January 1956. All Souls' Anglican church was dedicated on 26 March 1961 by Archbishop Halse and consecrated on 9 March 1975 by Archbishop Arnott. Its closure was approved circa 1986. It was located at 10 Tel El Kebir Street on the corner of Heliopolis Parade (). As at 2020, the building is used as a child care centre. Mt Maria College was established in Mitchelton in 1979 by amalgamating Years 11 and 12 of Marcellin College (a Catholic boys school in Enoggera) with St Benedict's College (a Catholic girls school in Wilston). It occupied the former Good Shepherd Home. Mitchelton State Special School opened on 17 May 1971. The current Mitchelton Public Library opened in 1983 and had a major refurbishment in 2013. Heritage listings St Matthews Anglican Church, Grovely (now Mitchelton), 2010 Home of the Good Shepherd (now Mt Maria College), Mitchelton, Brisbane, 1931 Mitchelton has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * 35 Church Road: St Matthews Anglican Church, Grovely * 46 Church Road: former Redemptorist Monastery * 10 Corvi Street: Residence * 67 Osborne Road: Good Shepherd Home, Mt Maria College * Samford Road (opposite Suez Street): Bus shelter * 543 Samford Road: former Police Station * 600 Samford Road: Our Lady of Dolours Church * 671 Samford Road: former Mitchelton Infants School * 71 St Helens Road: Residence Facilities Mitchelton is now filled with many shops, schools and facilities, such as the Brookside Shopping Centre, and a very attractive shopping district on Blackwood Avenue that also features a monthly market which attracts many vendors of fine foods and wares as well as tourists. Mitchelton is also home to many sporting teams in state competition. Mitchelton Football club, located in Teralba Park on Osborne road is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2020. The original team was called the Black Diamonds, and had distinctive uniforms in white with a black diamond on the shirt. The black diamonds were also one of the first teams in the Brisbane area that had aborigines on the team. Of note, the internationally famous singing group, the Bee Gees, Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, performed at the Mitchelton Soccer Club Trophy Night in 1960 before they shot to stardom. The Brisbane City Council operates a public library in Mitchelton at 37 Heliopolis Parade. Transport Via train, Oxford Park Railway Station and Mitchelton Railway Station provide access to regular Queensland Rail City network services on the Ferny Grove railway line arranging travel to the Brisbane CBD, Beenleigh and Ferny Grove. Via bus, Mitchelton is served by Brisbane Transport buses to the Brisbane CBD, Chermside, Toowong and Ferny Grove. Via road, Mitchelton's main arterials are Samford Road, which is the main corridor for motorists travelling to The City and Samford, as well as Osborne Road which is the main corridor for motorists travelling to the outer Northern suburbs such as Aspley. Via bikeway, Mitchelton has direct access to the Kedron Brook bikeway which leads all the way to the coast over 20 km away and passes many vistas along the way.  Education  Mitchelton is home to numerous schools, which include Mitchelton State School, Mitchelton State High School, Mitchelton Special School, Our Lady of Dolours Primary School and Mt Maria College, which is based in the old Sisters of the Good Shepherd home for troubled girls.

The rights concerning intersex people are more vague. This keeps pace with the latest global figures on acceptance of homosexuality, which suggest that acceptance of LGBTQ communities is becoming more widespread only in secular, affluent countries. However, an accepting policy toward gay and lesbian soldiers does not invariably guarantee that LGBTQ citizens are immune to discrimination in that particular society. Even in countries where LGBTQ persons are free to serve in the military, activists lament that there remains room for improvement. Israel, for example, a country that otherwise struggles to implement LGBTQ-positive social policy, nevertheless has a military well known for its broad acceptance of openly gay soldiers. History has seen societies that both embrace and shun openly gay service-members in the military. But more recently, the high-profile 2010 hearings on \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" in the United States propelled the issue to the center of international attention. They also shed light both on the routine discrimination, violence, and hardship faced by LGBTQ-identified soldiers, as well as arguments for and against a ban on their service. LGBT Military Index The LGBT Military Index is an index created by the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies that uses 19 indicative policies and best practices to rank over 100 countries on the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender service members in the armed forces. Countries with higher rankings, especially the ones at the top, stand out for their multiple concerted efforts to promote the inclusion of gay and lesbian soldiers. In many of them special support and advocacy organizations are present. By contrast, countries near the bottom of the index show the lack of aspiration to promote greater inclusion of the LGBT military personnel. History of sexual orientation in the military In ancient Greece, the Sacred Band of Thebes was a military unit from 378 BCE which consisted of male lovers who were known for their effectiveness in battle.Homosexuality in Greece and Rome , 2.14 Plutarch, Pelopidas 18-19 Same-sex love also occurred among the Samurai class in Japan, being practiced between an adult and a younger apprentice.Love of the Samurai: A Thousand Years of Japanese Homosexuality, Tsuneo Watanabe and Jun ºichi Iwata, 1989. However, homosexual behavior has been considered a criminal offense according to civilian and military law in most countries throughout history. There are various accounts of trials and executions of members of the Knights Templar in the 14th century and British sailors during the Napoleonic wars for homosexuality.Brief History of Gays in the Military Official bans on gays serving in the military first surfaced in the early 20th century. The U.S. introduced a ban in a revision of the Articles of War of 1916 and the UK first prohibited homosexuality in the Army and Air Force Acts in 1955.European Court of Human Rights Overturns British Ban on Gays in Military, Richard Kamm, Human Rights Brief 7, no. 3, 2000, p. 18-20 However some nations, of which Sweden is the most well-known case, never introduced bans on homosexuality in the military, but issued recommendations on exempting homosexuals from military service. To regulate homosexuality in the U.S. military, physical exams and interviews were used to spot men with effeminate characteristics during recruitment. Many soldiers accused of homosexual behavior were discharged for being \\"sexual psychopaths\\", although the number of discharges greatly decreased during wartime efforts.Homosexuals in the U.S. Military: Open Integration and Combat Effectiveness, By Elizabeth Kier, International Security 23, no.2, MIT Press, 1998, p. 5-39 The rationale for excluding gays and lesbians from serving in the military is often rooted in cultural norms and values and has changed over time. Originally, it was believed that gays were not physically able to serve effectively. The pervading argument during the 20th century focused more on military effectiveness. And finally, more recent justifications include the potential for conflict between heterosexual and homosexual service members and possible \\"heterosexual resentment and hostility.\\" Many countries have since revised these policies and allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military (e.g. Israel in 1993 and the UK in 2000). There are currently more than 30 countries, including nearly all of the NATO members which allow gays and lesbians to serve and around 10 more countries that don't outwardly prohibit them from serving.Countries Where Gays Do Serve Openly In The Military, May 25, 2011 Retrieved 2013-15-11 The U.S. is one of the last more developed nations to overturn its ban on allowing gays, lesbians and bisexuals to openly serve in the military when it repealed the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy in 2010.'Don't ask, don't tell' ban on openly gay troops overturned, Senate passes bill 65-31, Dec 18, 2010, Retrieved 2013-15-11 Transgender military service Like sexual orientation, policies regulating the service of transgender military personnel vary greatly by country. Based on data collected by the Hague Centre for Strategic StudiesJoshua Polchar et al., LGBT Military Personnel; A Strategic Vision for Inclusion (The Hague, the Netherlands: The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, 2014) seventeen countries currently allow transgender people to serve in their military. They are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.Elders et al, \\"Medical Aspects of Transgender Military Service\\" Armed Forces & Society (2014) vol. 41 no. 2 pp 199-220 While the US military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was rescinded in 2011 allowing open service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members, transgender people are still barred from entering the US military. This ban is effective via enlistment health screening regulations: \\"Current or history of psychosexual conditions (302), including but not limited to transsexualism, exhibitionism, transvestism, voyeurism, and other paraphilias.\\" Unlike Don't Ask, Don't Tell, this policy is not a law mandated by Congress, but an internal military policy. Despite this, studies suggest that the propensity of trans individuals to serve in the US military is as much as twice that as cisgender individuals. In the Harvard Kennedy School's 2013 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 20% of transgender respondents reported having served in the armed forces, compared with 10% of cisgender respondents. American transgender veterans face institutional hardships, including the provision of medical care while in the armed services and after discharge stemming from their gender identity or expression. Transgender veterans may also face additional challenges, such as facing a higher rate of homelessness and home foreclosure, higher rates of losing jobs often directly stemming from their trans identity, and high rates of not being hired for specific jobs because of their gender identity. Intersex military service The armed forces of Israel, the United States and Australia have employed intersex individuals depending on the nature of their conditions, but the guidelines are vague and seldom talked about.Serving in Silence?: Australian LGBT servicemen and women Foreword Discrimination in militaries without explicit limitations or welcoming In the US army, six states (Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and West Virginia) initially refused to comply with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's order that gay spouses of National Guard members be given the same federal marriage benefits as heterosexual spouses, forcing couples to travel hours round trip to the nearest federal installation. Furthermore, some benefits offered on bases, like support services for relatives of deployed service members, could still be blocked. This changed with a ruling by US Attorney General Loretta Lynch in the Supreme Court on 26 June 2015 which ruled that Federal marriage benefits would be made available to gay couples in all 50 US states. In 2013 legal changes were said to revert to practices to those before Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the National Defense Authorization Act contains language some claimed permitted individuals to continue discriminating against LGB soldiers. From June 30, 2016 to April 11, 2019, transgender personnel in the United States military were allowed to serve in their preferred gender upon completing transition. From January 1, 2018 to April 11, 2019, transgender individuals could enlist in the United States military under the condition of being stable for 18 months in their preferred or biological gender. On July 26, 2017, President Donald Trump announced on his Twitter page that transgender individuals would no longer be allowed \\"to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military\\", effectively reinstating the ban. Further, throughout the US army, transgender people are still suffering from discrimination: they are prohibited from serving openly because of medical regulations that label them as mentally unstable. On the contrary, in Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom, as of 2010, when civil partnerships became legal in the respective countries, military family benefits followed the new laws, without discrimination. Fear of discrimination may prevent military service members to be open about their sexual orientation. A 2004 report stated that in some cases, in Belgium, homosexual personnel have been transferred from their unit if they have been \\"too open with their sexuality.\\" , the Belgian military reserved the right to deny gay and lesbian personnel high-level security clearances, for fear they may be susceptible to blackmail. In 1993, a study showed that in Canada, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands and Norway, the number of openly homosexual service members was small, representing only a minority of homosexuals usually serving. Serving openly may make their service less pleasant or impede their careers, even though there were no explicit limitations to serve. Thus service members who acknowledged their homosexuality were \\"appropriately\\" circumspect in their behavior while in military situations; i.e. they did not call attention to themselves. Today, in the Danish army, LGBT military personnel refrain from being completely open about their homosexuality. Until training is completed and a solid employment is fixed they fear losing respect, authority and privileges, or in worse cases their job in the Danish army. In 2010, the same updated study showed that in Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy and United Kingdom, no special treatment to prevent discrimination was in place in those armies, the issue is not specifically addressed, it is left to the leadership discretion. Commanders said that sexual harassment of women by men poses a far greater threat to unit performance than anything related to sexual orientation. On the other hand, the Dutch military directly addressed the issue of enduring discrimination, by forming the Homosexuality and Armed Forces Foundation, a trade union that continues to represent gay and lesbian personnel to the ministry of defense, for a more tolerant military culture. Although homosexuals in the Dutch military rarely experience any explicitly aggressive acts against them, signs of homophobia and cultural insensitivity are still present. Violence faced by LGBT people in the military Physical, sexual, psychological (harassment, bullying) violence faced by LGBT is a fact of life for many LGBT identified persons. In an inherently violent environment, LGBT people may face violence unique to their community in the course of military service. According to a 2012 news article, the Israeli Defense Force does not ask the sexual orientation of its soldiers, however half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia. LGBT soldiers are often victims of verbal and physical violence and for the most part, commanders ignore the phenomenon. SAPRO, the organization responsible for the oversight of the Department of Defense (DoD - USA) sexual assault policy, produces the \\"Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Member (WGRA)\\": The 2012 report doesn't have any paragraph studying the specific situation of LGBT people. The study focuses on men and women. The specificity of the violence faced by LGBT people is not considered. In the Australian army, the problem is not known officially; only a few cases of harassment and discrimination involving gays and lesbians have been recorded. A researcher mentioned that \\"one would not want to be gay and in the military\\": Although there has been no major public scandal regarding harassment of gays, this does not mean that such behavior does not occur, but it has been under-studied. Generally, however, incidents of discrimination or harassment brought to the attention of commanders are handled appropriately, incidents in which peers who had made inappropriate remarks are disciplined by superiors promptly and without reservation. Being LGBT in the military In the United States, despite policy changes allowing for open LGBQ military service and the provision of some benefits to same-sex military couples, cultures of homophobia and discrimination persist. Several academics have written on the effects on employees in non-military contexts concealing their sexual orientation in the workplace. Writers on military psychology have linked this work to the experiences of LGBQ military service personnel, asserting that these studies offer insights into the lives of open LGBQ soldiers and those who conceal their orientation. Sexual orientation concealment and sexual orientation linked harassment are stressors for LGBT individuals that lead to negative experiences and deleterious job-related outcomes. Specifically, non-open LGBT persons are found to experience social isolation. In particular these products of work related stress can affect military job performance, due to the high reliance on connection and support for the well-being of all service members. In the United States LGBQ soldiers are not required to disclose their sexual orientation, suggesting that some LGBQ service members may continue to conceal their sexual orientation. Studies suggest this could have harmful effects for the individual. A 2013 study conducted at the University of Montana found that non-open LGB US veterans face significantly higher rates of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol or other substance abuse than their heterosexual counterparts. These veterans also reported facing significant challenges serving while concealing their sexual orientation; 69.3% of subjects in the study reported experiencing fear or anxiety as a result of concealing their sexual identity, and 60.5% reported that those experiences led to a more difficult time for the respondent than heterosexual colleagues. This study also concludes that 14.7% of LGB American veterans made serious attempts at suicide. This rate of suicide attempts compares to another study of the entire American veteran community that found .0003% of American veterans attempt suicide. Evidence suggests that for LGB service members in the United States, the conditions of service and daily life have improved dramatically following the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Soldiers who choose to come out experience feelings of liberation, and report that no longer having to hide their orientation allows them to focus on their jobs. Support groups for LGB soldiers have also proliferated in the United States. Arguments for including openly LGBT people Until recently, many countries banned gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces. The reasons to enforce this ban included the potential negative impact on unit cohesion and privacy concerns. However, many studies commissioned to examine the effects on the military found that little evidence existed to support the discriminatory policy. Moreover, when the bans were repealed in several countries including the UK, Canada, and Australia, no large scale issues arose as a result. In fact, several studies provide evidence that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the armed forces can result in more positive work related outcomes. Firstly, discharging trained military personnel for their sexual orientation is costly and results in loss of talent. The total cost for such discharges in the U.S for violating the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy amounted to more than 290 million dollars. Secondly, privacy for service members has actually increased in countries with inclusive policies and led to a decrease in harassment. Although, it is important to note that many gays and lesbians do not disclose their sexual orientation once the ban is repealed., Gays in Foreign Militaries 2010: A Global Primer. Finally, allowing gays to openly serve ends decades of discrimination in the military and can lead to a more highly qualified pool of recruits. For instance, the British military reduced its unfilled position gap by more than half after allowing gays to openly serve.U.S. allies say integrating gays in military was nonissue, May 20, 2010, Retrieved 2013-15-11 Therefore, more evidence exists now to support policies that allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military. Arguments for not including openly LGBT people The arguments against allowing openly gay servicemen and women in the military abound. While most research data have all but debunked traditional arguments in favor of policies like Don't Ask, Don't Tell, homosexuality is still perceived by many countries to be incompatible with military service. A recurrent argument for a ban on homosexuals in the military rests on the assumption that, in the face of potentially homosexual members of their unit, prospective recruits would shy away from military service. Based on an inconclusive study produced by the RAND Corporation in the run-up to the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, American military recruits were expected to decrease by as much as 7%. However, this does not appear to have materialized. In a line of work that regularly demands that personnel be in close living quarters, allowing openly homosexual servicemen is argued to flout a fundamental tenet of military service: ensuring that soldiers remain undistracted from their mission. If gay men are allowed to shower with their fellow male soldiers, so goes the argument, this would, in effect, violate the \\"unique conditions\\" of military life by putting sexually compatible partners in close proximity, with potentially adverse effects on retention and morale of troops. Testimony advanced during the hearings on Don't Ask, Don't Tell of 1993, with US Senator Sam Nunn and General Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. recalled \\"instances where heterosexuals have been solicited to commit homosexual acts, and, even more traumatic emotionally, physically coerced to engage in such acts\\".

He served as military officer in the United States Army during several wars, accompanied John C. Fr√©mont on his second expedition through the West, and was instrumental in the formation of the government of the Oregon Territory. As a politician and writer, he was an inveterate believer in Manifest Destiny and was a visionary booster of new settlement to the West, helping lay the groundwork in his writings for a modern theory of the succession of civilizations. Gilpin served as the first governor of the Colorado Territory. His administration was consumed largely with the defense of the new territory in the early days of the American Civil War and was brought down after only one year by scandalous financial dealings. After the demise of his political career, he made a large fortune as a land speculator in New Mexico, although his dealings were questionable and possibly illegal. Early life Gilpin was born near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania a son of Joshua Gilpin, a merchant and paper maker. They were a wealthy family of Quakers. He was educated by private tutors and studied abroad in England for two years before attending the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1833. He attended West Point from 1834 to 1835, but did not graduate. He received a commission as second lieutenant with the 2nd Dragoon Regiment in June 1836 and served in the Seminole Wars. He also served as a recruiter in Missouri. While in Missouri, he became attracted to opportunities on the frontier and to the idea of westward expansion of the nation. After resigning in April 1838, he moved to St. Louis where he became a newspaper editor and opened a law practice. After three years in St. Louis, he moved across the state to Independence, where he interacted with emigrants about to embark on the Oregon Trail. Pacific Northwest In 1843 he encountered John C. Fr√©mont along the Santa Fe Trail and embarked westward with Fr√©mont on his expedition to find a route over the continental divide. While passing through the region of present-day Colorado, he encountered evidence of placer gold in the region, but the information would go unused for at least another decade. When the party reached Walla Walla in the Oregon Country, Gilpin continued westward on his own while Fr√©mont continued on to California. At the time, the Oregon Country was under joint administration by the United States and the United Kingdom, but in practical terms it was controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver. Gilpin settled among the growing community of U.S. settlers in the Willamette Valley and became active in the organization of a provisional government. At the landmark convention at Champoeg, he helped draft a petition requesting support for the provisional government from the United States Congress. Gilpin himself was charged with carrying the Willamette petition back east. On his way back through Missouri, he helped publicize the Pacific Northwest and stir up \\"Oregon fever\\". He delivered the petition to Congress in 1845, then wrote memoirs of his travels in the Pacific Northwest to emphasize its potential for trade and settlement. The Central Gold Region In 1846, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he was commissioned as Major of the 1st Missouri Mounted Infantry Regiment and marched to Chihuahua City in the successful bloodless campaign to capture New Mexico. He was considered to have served with distinction in the campaign and was later given command of a mounted infantry battalion to protect the Santa Fe Trail against attacks by Native Americans. Gilpin was also involved with the ill-fated Fort Mann, just west of what is now Dodge City, Kansas. The man Gilpin put in charge of the post created havoc and Gilpin attempted to rectify some of the problems caused there.Santa Fe Trail Research Site, at http://santafetrailresearch.com/research/fort-mann-ra-white.html After the end of the war in 1848, he returned to Missouri and resumed his law practice. He made an unsuccessful attempt at a political career while in Missouri as well. In 1859, Gilpin's early intuition about gold in Colorado proved correct, and the region suddenly became the target for thousands of eager and hopeful prospectors in the ensuing Colorado Gold Rush. That year, Gilpin published a futurist history of the region, called The Central Gold Region, in which he wrote, \\"the destiny of the American people is to subdue the continent\\". In the book he predicted that the Mississippi River valley would become the center of western civilization with the new settlement of Denver as its capital, based partly on its location near the 40th parallel north. In the book, Gilpin envisioned that all the great cities of the world along that latitude would eventually be linked by railroad lines and proposed a rail line over the Bering Strait connecting North America and Asia. Throughout his career in politics, Gilpin was a strong believer that the American West would not only be settled but also eventually hold an enormous population. He was a particularly strong advocate of the now-debunked climatological theory of \\"Rain follows the plow\\". This theory held that settlement in the arid lands of the West would actually increase rainfall in the region, making it as fertile and green as the Eastern United States. Governor of Colorado In the early 1860s the crisis in Kansas prompted Gilpin to join the Republican Party, putting him at odds with many citizens of Missouri. His political alignment with the new administration of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was rewarded in 1861 when Lincoln appointed him governor of the newly formed Territory of Colorado. His selection over the local favorite William Larimer came as a surprise to many, and was motivated in part by the fact that Gilpin was backed by the Governor of Missouri, a slave state that Lincoln was eager to keep in the Union. The US Government's Official Register for 1861 lists Gilpin as both Governor of Colorado (at a salary of $1,500 a year) and as governor and ex officio superintendent of the Indian Office's Colorado Superintendency ($2,500 a year).\\"Register of Officers and Agents, Civil, Military, and Naval, in the Service of the United States on the Thirtieth September, 1861\\" (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1862), pp. 14, 87. =American Civil War= Governor Gilpin left Missouri and arrived in Denver City on May 29, 1861, to cheering crowds. Despite his warm reception, his administration was plagued with difficulties from the outset. The territory had been organized at the start of the Civil War and faced a complex set of threats, including Confederate sympathizers within the territory, the possibility of a Confederate invasion from outside, and looming tensions with Native Americans (in particular the Arapaho and Cheyenne) in the wake of the withdrawal of U.S. Army troops in the region for other duties. The imminent threats facing the territory prompted Gilpin to act quickly without receiving authorization from the federal government. He appointed a territorial military staff and, despite having no funds for military purposes, he began to solicit volunteers for a military regiment. Without funds, he took the daring step of issuing $375,000 in drafts on the federal treasury, with the expectation that the federal government would honor them later. He later claimed that he had received verbal authorization from Lincoln for issuing the drafts before leaving for Colorado. At first, most of the merchants and citizens of the territory were willing to support Gilpin's fundraising campaign, but doubt began to spread through the territory after rumors from Washington, DC confirmed that the federal government did not intend to validate the drafts. By the summer of 1861, many of the citizens of the territory were in an uproar, and petitions were circulated calling for Gilpin's removal from office. The movement against him was fostered by the anger of William N. Byers, the powerful editor of the Rocky Mountain News, whose newspaper had been bypassed in favor of a rival in the awarding of the territorial printing contract. Under attack in his own state, Gilpin went to Washington to plead his case for the validation of the drafts. Despite the controversy, the funds already raised from the drafts allowed the creation of the 1st Colorado Volunteers, widely derided as \\"Gilpin's Pet Lambs\\". The regiment trained in the summer and fall of 1861 at Camp Weld near Denver. The mustering and training of the regiment proved highly useful when the Confederates launched an invasion northward through the New Mexico Territory in the spring of 1862. The invasion, today called the New Mexico Campaign, aimed to seize the mineral-rich Colorado Territory and eventually California. The 1st Colorado Volunteers played a critical role in repelling the Confederates, routing the Texans at the Battle of Glorieta Pass, which became known as the \\"Gettysburg of the West\\". Despite the enormous success of the regiment, the territory was mired in financial problems caused by Gilpin's drafts, which had tied up most of the circulating currency without any resolution regarding their validation. Eventually the federal treasury settled the drafts after being presented with itemized statements by their holders. The resolution came too late for Gilpin, on May 21,1862 Lincoln removed him from the governorship of the territory and replaced him with John Evans. Rocky Mountain News May 20, 1862 and Rocky Mountain News May 21, 1862 The Sangre de Cristo Land Grant In 1863, Gilpin and a syndicate of foreign investors bought the Charles H. Beaubien land grant (often referred to as the Sangre de Cristo Land Grant on the east slopes of the mountains) in southeast Colorado for about 4 cents an acre ($41,000). Gilpin and his investors then tried to evict residents on the property. Litigation over the property continues to this day. He was also one of the early owners of the Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4.Spanish ‚Äì Mexican Land Grants: A Brief Introduction ‚Äì colorado.gov ‚Äì Retrieved March 6, 2008 He died in 1894 in Denver, Colorado after being run over by a horse and buggy and was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery (Wheat Ridge) in Jefferson County, Colorado.

W. Scripps Company, that operated from 1978 to 2011. It syndicated 150 comics and editorial columns worldwide. Its core businesses were the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association. History E. W. Scripps started his newspaper career in the 1885, and owned 22 newspapers by 1910. In 1897, he created two companies, the Scripps-McRae Press Association and the Scripps News Association. In 1907, he combined a number of news providers into United Press Associations as a rival to Associated Press. On June 2, 1902, the new Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), based in Cleveland, Ohio, started as a news report service for different Scripps-owned newspapers. It started selling content to non-Scripps owned newspapers in 1907, and by 1909, it became a more general syndicate, offering comics, pictures and features as well. At that time, it had some 100 features available. United Feature Syndicate was formed in 1919.Booker, M.

It occurs as an expletive and in expressions such as \\"fraks things up good\\" and \\"frakking toasters\\" Other uses \\"Frak!\\" was the title of a game released on the BBC Micro B and Acorn Electron in 1984, and later the Commodore 64. The game saw the user controlling a caveman called Trogg, who had to navigate maze-like scenarios and dispose of deadly obstacles; when coming into contact with such an obstacle or falling a substantial distance, Trogg would cry \\"Frak!\\" \\"Frak\\" is used in the same sense as in Battlestar by characters in the early 21st century \\"Ciaphas Cain\\" series of Games Workshop Warhammer 40,000 novels by Sandy Mitchell. \\"Frak\\" is also used in the same sense as in Battlestar several times in the Warner Bros. / DC Comics television series Arrow. Specifically by the characters Felicity Smoak, Curtis Holt, and Mia Queen. An example can be seen in the season four episode \\"Lost in the Flood\\" at 22:05. A campaign in the United Kingdom aimed at banning hydraulic fracturing, the controversial method of shale gas extraction commonly known as fracking, have organised themselves under the name Frack Off.

The company is wholly owned by Cardiff Council and is one of the few municipal bus companies to remain in council ownership. History Cardiff Trolleybus While horse buses (and later horse trams) had run in the city since 1845, Cardiff Bus can trace its history back to May 1902, when Cardiff Council took over and electrified a tram line between Roath and the city centre. It had been previously run by the Cardiff Tramway Company. The resultant Cardiff Corporation Tramways spent the next three decades extending its electric tram network, and at its peak in 1927 ran 141 electric trams over 18 miles of line. On Christmas Eve 1920, the corporation introduced its first bus, although the first motor bus route was operated by the Tramway Company from 1907.The Cardiff Story, Cardiff Bus. Retrieved 19 October 2017. The first Cardiff trolleybuses were introduced in 1942, their introduction having been delayed by the outbreak of World War II. The intention was to convert the remaining tramway system to trolleybus operation, then to extend the network. While the first stage was completed in 1950, the only extension made to the system was to Ely which took place in 1955. Although powers had been obtained to considerably expand the network, a policy U-turn occurred in 1961 when the decision was made to replace all the trolleybuses with motor buses. This task was completed in 1970, bringing to an end 68 years of electric traction on the streets of Cardiff. The Transport Act of 1985 deregulated bus services outside London and required all Local Authorities to establish private \\"arm's length\\" bus companies. In October 1986 the council established a subsidiary company.Companies House extract company no 2001229 Cardiff City Transport Services Limited In 1992, the closure of the National Welsh bus company led Cardiff Bus to extend and intensify its network in the areas and towns surrounding Cardiff, including Barry, the Vale of Glamorgan and Caerphilly. The Caerphilly local network of services including links between Cardiff, Caerphilly, Blackwood and Tredegar were discontinued in 2001 and are now provided by Stagecoach in South Wales. Some loss-making services have been withdrawn and are now operated under local authority tender by other operators, including Watts Coaches and NAT Group. From September 2016, four of Cardiff Bus' services (routes 51/53, 86 and X91) were transferred to its new Capital Links sister brand, with a further four services transferring over to Capital Links two months later. Vehicles used on these services are in either an orange or green base livery, and as of July 2017, Capital Links operate seven routes. Operations Cardiff Bus has a turnover of ¬£27million, employs around 705 people, on an average weekday carries around 100,000 passengers. In 2009 the company started to operate the park and ride service from Cardiff City Stadium to the city centre. =Fares= Cardiff Bus operates an exact fare policy and no change is given. The city used to be divided into four fare zones, but on 5 April 2009, Cardiff Bus introduced a flat fare of ¬£1.60 for a one-way journey or ¬£3.20 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or ¬£1.40/¬£2.80 for travel within Barry. This has since been increased to ¬£2.00 for a one-way journey or ¬£4.00 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or ¬£1.90 and ¬£3.80 in Barry (¬£3.20/¬£5.50 Cardiff and Barry). A weekly ticket can be purchased for travel within Cardiff for ¬£15, but an \\"iff card\\" will need to be presented as this type of ticket is not printed out on their machine. Tickets can also be purchased on the mobile app (available for iOS and Android). Special fares apply for travel between Cardiff and Barry. Special fares also apply for Newport, with a ¬£4.50 return ticket offered along with the Day to Go Plus ticket also being accepted. =Iff card= Iff card is a contactless smart card introduced by Cardiff Bus in October 2010, allowing customers to travel on its services after having pre-paid. The first 30,000 cards were issued free of charge and preloaded with ¬£3 of credit, after which the cards will be charged at ¬£5. An amount of money is electronically loaded onto the card, either upon boarding a bus or at the Cardiff Bus customer service centre. A passenger then chooses a ticket type. The card can also be used as a season ticket. The card should be topped-up when the balance is low, however, the card allows the customer to acquire a negative balance up to ¬£3.Smartcard Cardiff Bus The card can be topped-up in units of ¬£1, ¬£2, ¬£3, ¬£4, ¬£5, ¬£10, ¬£15 or ¬£20, up to maximum amount of ¬£50. The card may be used by persons aged between 6 and 60. The Iff card cannot be used to pay a partial amount. The card is cancelled if not used for a continuous period of one year.Iff: Terms and Conditions Cardiff Bus = Contactless = In March 2018 the company introduced the Ticketer contactless card payment system on all its routes. As well as including an EFTPOS reader for Visa/Mastercard cards, fares can be bought and scanned using the Cardiff Bus app (which on most tickets including day to go and week to go tickets is cheaper than using cash). The reader can also scan QR codes from paper multi- journey tickets. =Fleet= A Mercedes-Benz Citaro (in foreground) and an Alexander Dennis Enviro400 in Cathays As of August 2018, the fleet consists of 224 vehicles, all of which are low floor. Single deck vehicles dominate the fleet, accounting for 90.7% of the overall fleet. Since 2013, 90 brand new vehicles have been purchased, with the most recent being delivered in August 2017. On the double deck side of the fleet, of which there are 23 vehicles, ten high capacity Alexander Dennis Enviro400s joined the fleet in 2015. Prior to the delivery of the former, thirteen East Lancs Olympus bodied Scania N230UDs entered service in 2007. The most common single deck type is the Pointer-bodied Alexander Dennis/Dennis/TransBus Dart SLF, with 72 vehicles of three different lengths in the fleet. The second most common type is the Scania OmniCity, with 43 in total. Nineteen of the OmniCitys are the articulated variant. The Alexander Dennis Enviro200 also dominates, with 40 examples in the fleet, including ten with the \\"MMC\\" body. The Mercedes-Benz Citaro has become the standard large single deck type in recent years, with 40 Citaros in service as of August 2017. Operated in smaller numbers are the TransBus Enviro300, with twelve examples, and seven Wright Solar bodied Scania K230UBs. =Branding= Although the predominant colour of Cardiff is blue, the original branding in both the entire tram, trolley bus and early bus operations until the 1970s was crimson lake and cream livery. This then changed to orange with white lining, from August 1972 with \\"City of Cardiff\\" on the left hand side and \\"Dinas Caerdydd\\" on the right hand side. This changed in 1986 when the business became Cardiff Bus. However, since the 1990s the dominant colouring has been green, first with cream lining and since the introduction of modern wrapping, a return for orange in the adjustments/outline. Just before the introduction of the Iff Card, the company started a \\"your bus service\\" campaign, fronted by a series of local people's faces being applied in large scale on the sides and rears of selected buses. Bus 472 had a grey vinyl wrapped livery advertising the IFF card following its launch in 2008. It was then repainted into a heritage orange and white livery to celebrate 30 years since the formation of Cardiff Bus (after the 1986 deregulation of buses) and it currently sports a vinyl wrap celebrating Cardiff's sporting success with Cardiff City Football Club, Cardiff Blues, Cardiff Devils ice hockey team and Gerraint Thomas winning the Tour De France. Controversy Cardiff Bus's dominant position has sometimes come in for criticism and investigation. In 2004, 2Travel,Companies House extract company no 3823139 2 Travel Group plc a company operating significant numbers of school contract services in South Wales, launched low-cost services in Cardiff and Swansea to utilise its fleet between the school runs. Low fares were achieved by omitting major bus stations avoiding hefty access fees. Cardiff Bus launched a basic service in competition with 2Travel, using white buses bearing no livery also stopping short of the bus station. The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation in 2007 into claims of predatory behaviour 18 months after 2Travel had ceased trading and gone into liquidation.Bus firm predatory tactics claim BBC News 15 May 2007OFT under fire for delays in Cardiff Bus case Western Mail 16 May 2007 The investigation found that Cardiff Bus had engaged in predatory behaviour.Cardiff Bus Office of Fair Trading 2008 Gallery =Branding= Different branding worn by Cardiff Bus vehicles.

These borders were the result of the Occupation of the Baltic States, Eastern Poland and Bessarabia in 1940. The line stretched from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains. It was made up of thirteen fortified regions, most covering about 100 km of the border. It was a part of the larger Soviet defence network along its western borders, stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. Each fortified region (in Russian ukreplennyi raion, or UR) consisted of a large number of concrete bunkers (pillboxes) armed with machineguns, antitank guns and artillery. The bunkers were built in groups for mutual support, each group forming a centre of resistance. A dedicated military unit was permanently assigned to man each region. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941 during the course of Operation Barbarossa, most of the line was not yet finished, and hence posed a negligible obstacle to the invading forces. Only the four southernmost regions, partly completed, were able to hamper the advance of the Wehrmacht for a few days. (The Brest Fortress resisted much longer, but it was an older fortification technically not part of the Molotov line). The ruins of these fortifications, many of them well preserved, can be found today in Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. The modern borders are somewhat different from the borders in 1941, and hence some sections of the line do not lie in border zones and are easily accessible. On the other hand, other sections do lie right along the modern Polish-Ukrainian, Polish-Belarusian and Lithuanian-Russian borders, so access to them may still be restricted for reasons of border security. In Lithuania the line consisted of four fortified regions: * 1. Tel≈°iai fortified region (line from Palanga to Judrƒónai, 75 kilometers, 8 centers of resistance, 23 bunkers built and 366 under construction on June 22, 1941). * 2. ≈†iauliai fortified region (line from Paj≈´ris to Jurbarkas, 90 kilometers, 6 centers of resistance, 27 bunkers built and 403 under construction). * 3. Kaunas fortified region (line from Jurbarkas to Kalvarija, 105 kilometers, 10 centers of resistance, 31 bunkers built and 599 under construction). * 4. Alytus fortified region (line from Kalvarija to border of Lithuanian SSR, 57 kilometers, 5 centers of resistance, 20 bunkers built and 273 under construction). Overall 101 bunkers were built in Lithuania but many were not fully completed. They were significantly vulnerable and could be neutralised quickly by throwing grenades or burning fuel into periscope shafts, which were absolutely unprotected. Continuing south, the other regions, today located along the eastern border of Poland with Belarus and Ukraine, were: * 5. Grodno fortified region ‚Äì 80 km, 9 centers of resistance, 42/98/606 bunkers operational/built/under construction on June 22, 1941 (in Belarus and Poland) * 6. Osowiec fortified region ‚Äì 60 km, 8 centers of resistance, 35/59/594 (in Poland) * 7. Zambr√≥w fortified region ‚Äì 70 km, 10 centers of resistance, 30/53/550 (in Poland) * 8.

He was killed in the Battle of Iquique, during the War of the Pacific. During his career, Prat had taken part in several naval engagements, including battles at Papudo (1865), and at the Abtao (1866). Following his death, his name became a rallying cry for Chilean forces, and Arturo Prat has since been considered a national hero. Prat's name is commemorated on numerous plazas (squares), streets, buildings and other structures in Chile. His name has been commemorated by four of Chile's major warships, including a in the 1950s, a British from 1983 to 2006, and most recently a Dutch transferred to Chile as Capitan Prat in 2006. One of Chile's Antarctic research facilities, Arturo Prat Station, and the Chilean Naval Academy, Escuela Naval Arturo Prat are named after him. His portrait appears on the 10,000 Chilean peso bank note. Also, in 1984 Arturo Prat University was founded, with its main campus in Iquique where his heroic deed took place.  Early life  Arturo Prat, the oldest of five brothers, (Ricardo, Rodolfo, Atala Rosa and Escilda Aurelia) son of Agust√≠n Prat del Barril and Rosario Chac√≥n Barrios, was born at the San Agust√≠n de Pu√±ual Hacienda in south-central Chile on April 3, 1848. The name Prat is of Catalan origin (not to be confused with the English 'Pratt'). He entered the Naval Academy on August 28, 1858 at the age of 10 years thanks to one of the scholarships created by President Manuel Montt, another son of Catalan immigrants. There were two scholarships per province: one for Arauco went to Prat, and the other went to Luis Uribe. Both had the same benefactor, Don Jacinto Chac√≥n (uncle of Arturo and stepfather of Uribe), resulting in the two youths considering each other as brothers. At the time, the academy was directed by the Frenchman Juan Julio Feillet and was backed by another Frenchman, Anatolio Desmadryl. Young Arturo and his friend Luis were part of the so-called \\"class of the heroes\\" including Carlos Condell, Juan Jos√© Latorre, and Jorge Montt √Ålvarez. In 1859, his second year as a cadet, he commenced a nautical apprenticeship ‚Äì a requirement for second-year students. His first voyage of training was completed in the steamer Independencia, with sail and rigging maneuvers, followed later by practice in seamanship and artillery. In January 1860, Prat boarded, for the first time, Esmeralda. His nautical apprenticeship continued: embarkation and disembarkation, combat simulation, etc. In July 1861, he left the Naval Academy as \\"primera antig√ºedad\\" (the most distinguished in the course). He obtained the grade of \\"midshipman without examination\\". During this period, Prat distinguished himself in an incident involving Infernal, a French ship that was carrying explosive materials. On October 1, 1861, it caught on fire while in the Bay of Valpara√≠so. Esmeralda, which was nearby, sent boats to save the wreck, one of which was steered by Prat, who would struggle for two hours against the fire. = War with Spain = On July 21, 1864, Arturo Prat passed the theoretical and practical test needed to be promoted from \\"midshipman without exam\\" to \\"examined midshipman\\". That year saw the incidents that resulted in the war against Spain, inflamed by the Chilean attitude towards the occupation of the Peruvian Chincha Islands by a Spanish squadron. The resulting war would prove to be a baptism of fire for Prat and his classmates. Commanding Esmeralda at the time was Juan Williams Rebolledo, who planned the recovery of the Chilean steamer and the capture of the Spanish schooner Covadonga. The naval battle of Papudo occurred on December 26 and rapidly went the way of the Chilean force which was superior in firepower and was able to capture the defeated ship. The capture of Covadonga resulted in the promotion by one grade of all sailors participating in the battle, converting Prat into an ensign (equivalent to a second lieutenant in the army). Wishing to offset their losses at Papudo, the Spanish fleet sought another confrontation with the allied navies (Peru and Ecuador added to Chile's side). Their desire for vengeance was fulfilled at Chilo√© in the battle of Abtao on February 7, 1866. Artillery combat occurred only between Covadonga and the Spanish ships Villa de Madrid and Blanca, as the other allied ships were unused due to a lack of coal and the rocky estuary. Prat then served on Covadonga, the ship which resisted the Spanish bombardment. There were no losses on the allied side, while the Spanish suffered two deaths. = Young officer = After the war, Prat completed a large number of sea voyages, both inside and outside his country, including voyages to the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, Easter Island (on the corvette Esmeralda under Policarpo Toro's command), Magallanes and Peru. During the latter trip in 1868, he was responsible for transporting aid to those affected by that year's earthquake, and he later brought back the remains of Bernardo O'Higgins, at the orders of Manuel Blanco Encalada. Prat was promoted to a lieutenant on September 9. The future hero returned to Naval School, but this time as an instructor. From 1871, he was the Second Commander of Esmeralda, leading to his appointment to several positions in the school (teacher, subdirector, internal director), and was assigned to teach courses such as Naval Order, Law, Naval Tactics and Cosmography. Additionally, he was responsible for docking the corvette for four years (1871‚Äì1874) in the port of Mejillones. He received the title of Graduated Corvette Captain (equivalent to lieutenant commander) in 1873 and in 1874. He was a dedicated teacher who fought against the lack of resources available to provide quality education. He himself translated textbooks from French to Spanish. Around that time, Prat faced an unusual situation. On May 24, 1875, Esmeralda was in the port of Valpara√≠so while Prat was on sick leave. The commander of the ship, Luis Alfredo Lynch, was also on leave so Lieutenant Constantino Bannen was left in charge. A storm began in the bay and Valdivia broke its ties and went right towards Esmeralda, which then impacted with Maipo. It appeared that the destruction of Esmeralda would be unavoidable. When Prat and Lynch returned, they managed to get transported back to the ship by boat, but the violent waves kept them from embarking. Arturo Prat threw himself into the water and swam to the ship to climb a rope (as Lynch had done just before him). He worked feverishly with a rope tied from his waist to the mast to accomplish rescue maneuvers resulting in the ship stopping with its bow against the beach and securing it there with rigging. Luis Alfredo Lynch would later remember Prat's \\"unflappable calm in the face of danger\\". The repair of Esmeralda was long and hard and cost 100,000 pesos. Lynch had to face charges of dereliction of duty, however he was saved by a tie in the voting. Throughout the trial, Arturo Prat was always faithful to his superior, helping him however he could. After the tests of May 1876 and only three years before the War of the Pacific, the Chilean government closed the Naval School, saying that Chile no longer needed naval officers. Prat, who left Condell in charge of Esmeralda, disembarked and, because of his studies in law, was named helper of the Maritime Government of Valpara√≠so. It was December 1876, he was already a graduated commander, but he would only return to the ship of his destiny once the war started.  Prat as a lawyer  =The studies= Naval Battle of Iquique In 1870, Prat began the path of becoming a lawyer. Prat had always had an interest in law and therefore decided to pursue his law degree. He entered as a secondary student in Humanities at the Liceo de Valpara√≠so and the National Institute (Instituto Nacional). In 1871, he received his diploma in Philosophy and Humanities ‚Äî a prerequisite for studying law. One of his examiners was the renowned Chilean historian Diego Barros Arana. In the following year, he began his studies in Property Law in the Faculty of Law of the University of Chile. He studied on board the \\"Esmeralda\\", which was located in Mejillones. Upon returning from his mission, he requested to take his examinations in Valpara√≠so where he passed the required subjects. In 1875, he began practicing law at a law firm in the port town as a prerequisite to receiving his license. In July of the following year, Prat passed his remaining courses and was then ready to complete his licensing. In order to graduate, he was required to pass an examination on a randomly chosen area of law. He was assigned Roman Law, which he managed to pass between 24‚Äì26 July 1876, while his thesis \\"Observaciones sobre la ley electoral vigente\\" (Observations on the current electoral law) was approved. There remained one final step before receiving his license ‚Äî a final exam before the judges of the Supreme Court. On 31 July 1876, at 11 a.m., the lieutenant commander passed through the corridors of Supreme Court of Justice in full dress uniform wearing his sword at his belt; he had come to take his examination before the highest judges, the final requirement to practise law. However, much to his surprise, Prat was told that the judges had decided not to hear examinations that day. Prat protested that he had an appointment for that day, that he had very little free time as a naval officer, and requested a meeting with Manuel Montt Torres, the Supreme Court president. Having convinced Montt to receive him, and to much applause from the court, Prat went on to become a lawyer at the age of 28. Prior to his final exam, Prat had already conducted legal work while defending the engineer Ricardo Owen, accused of disobedience, and also his friend and classmate Luis Uribe, accused of disobedience and contempt to his superiors. He succeeded the first time, but he was not so successful with the defence of his friend, who was condemned to six months of jail by six votes. The amnesty of the President saved Uribe and his naval career from that fate. =Jurist= Prat practised his recently adopted profession for a very short time. He primarily devoted himself to resolving the legal problems of the Chac√≥n and Carvajal families, as well as naval-related problems. He aspired to be a Navy auditor, but he was only sworn as \\"assistant\\" (mainly because of his lack of experience), assigned the legal aspects of the Navy General Command. Prat performed a complete remodeling of the army's legal system, starting with the Navigation Law. He presented 152 modifications to it, many of which were approved. He was also in charge of the regularization of the promotion system, proposing changes to avoid social relations, politics and other factors, making it a merit and seniority based system. Prat died without this navy code having been published. =\\"Observaciones a la ley electoral vigente\\"= This was Arturo Prat's thesis book, which contained many clues about his political thoughts. It was written within the framework of the promulgation of the new electoral law during Federico Err√°zuriz Za√±artu's government, in which the Greater Taxpayer Institution and Parliament Member Cumulative Vote were established. Prat analyzes this law with the perspective that it would make possible further progress towards electoral freedom. He points out the contradictions and obscurity of the text, but he stresses that it is an \\"eminently liberal\\" law. Prat ends saying: ...deep-down a good law, it needs serious and important reforms with respect to regulations if it is to achieve the lofty objective it is destined to: to be the effective guarantee that the voting result is the happy expression of the national will.\\" The text reveals Prat's political ideas, clearly reflecting the common liberalism of the times, and demonstrates a great naivety (not even with all of its indications could the law prevent the intervention of the executive power.)  Family life  =Engagement and matrimony= Pedro Chac√≥n used to throw parties in his portside house once or twice a week. Prat frequently attended, as did Concepci√≥n Chac√≥n's sister-in-law, Carmela Carvajal. In those happy get-togethers the couple met and fell in love, a love that would last a lifetime. Their attraction was obvious, but Prat was concerned when others mentioned it. In addition to his shyness, he was annoyed because he was afraid to formalize an engagement because he had no money to support the marriage. When he learned that he would be promoted to Corvette Captain, he finally decided to ask for Carmela's hand, in 1873. The only love letter from Prat to his fianc√©e that has survived is dated shortly after: > My Carmela, my life, my treasure, I have to tell you, that I adore you every > day more fervently, I cannot do it now because I am afraid I could fall ill. > Receive the passionate heart of your Arturo. On 5 May 1873 the wedding bells sounded over the San Agust√≠n de Valpara√≠so church. A beautiful red carpet was laid, over which the radiant 22-year-old bride passed on her way to the altar. Her parents had died when she was a girl, and she had been raised by her siblings, through whom she had contact with the Chac√≥n family. The Chac√≥n adopted her as a member of the family. Tall, slender and beautiful, she met with a sturdy Arturo Prat, with large forehead due to his baldness, thick beard and steady step. The minister, Jos√© Francisco Salas, blessed them at 10:30 am. They were married. Their relationship as spouses was based on a love that did not fade during the six years they lived together. Prat treated his wife as an equal, as a partner (something really rare in that society), putting her in charge of the family budget; and he, on the other hand, helped with some house chores: \\"At every moment I seem to find you exhausted from rocking our daughter, without me being next to you and sharing, albeit a bit, your labors...\\". =First happiness and first tragedy= The newlyweds spent their honeymoon in Quillota and in the Cauquenes's hot springs. After that, Prat returned to Valpara√≠so to resume his navy duties. He did not see his wife again until October. By that time Carmela was already pregnant with their first daughter. Prat wrote of his daughter's birth: > The fifth of march Carmela de la Concepci√≥n was born at 9:35 a.m., under the > circumstances that I had to go to Santiago just the day before... The fifth > of April she was baptised in the Church of the Holy Spirit, the godparents > being Conchita with Jos√© Jes√∫s... > It seems to me that she was to be very vivacious, smiling, playful... Last > night I dreamt about her and she seemed to know me and with her little face > a bit sad, she extended her little arms to hug me... But like Prat's older brothers who died very young, the girl inherited a very frail and sickly build. Arturo writes to Carmela: \\"Keep using homeopathy for my little daughter and inform me after she is healthy.\\" He has, undoubtedly, the hope that the method that (he supposed) cured his weak condition, would work the same wonders in little Carmela. But it didn't work, the child's life was extinguishing more and more every day, to the despair of the helpless parents, who put all their strengths in their prayers. > Poor little angel! I cannot see her any more, at least I want her to be > healthy. Carmelita's problem was a hernia caused by the badly removed umbilical cord, in addition to several other illnesses (diarrhea, fever, etc.) Adding to Prat's despair, at the end of the annual season, he had to be transferred to the center of the country, on the Abtao, a steamer that should have arrived but had not. On Sunday 13 December the boat finally arrived, and he wrote to his wife: \\"Later then I will be seeing you, as I will see my little child who I hope is completely healthy...\\" But the girl had died one week before on 5 December. At dusk, a devastating letter arrived from his wife: \\"My beloved Arturo, our dear little angel is still not well; I feel my heart fainting from pain and you are not here to hold me... If it were possible for you to come, that would be my only comfort. Don't despair my wellbeing, think of your unhappy Carmela.\\" Adding to Prat's desperation, the steamboat would not leave until the 18th. All his hopes were destroyed in that trip, days later, when he was given a condolence letter in an intermediate port, signed by Juan Jos√© Latorre. Arturo wrote at the foot of Carmela's previous letter: \\"The 5 December, at past 1 hour and 3 minutes after midnight, my daughter Carmela de la Concepci√≥n died. This is the letter destined to announce it to me. The sadness it reveals should have made me see, but hope is so sweet.\\"  War of the Pacific  Heroes of Iquique monument and crypt in Valpara√≠so, Chile. At the top is the statue of Prat, on the second level statues of Serrano, Riquelme, Aldea and a generic seaman When the war broke out, Prat was assigned to assistant of the Navy General Command, a position he tried to reject. When Don Rafael Sotomayor Baeza was required to go to Antofagasta with instructions from the Government, he requested an assistant, and Prat was assigned to the job. Being both of them aboard the armored Blanco Encalada, he was assigned to notify Iquique's authorities that they have been blocked by the Chilean army, which he did without letting the hostile position of the people daunt him. He was assigned Covadongas command. On 3 May the corvette Abtao, under lieutenant commander Carlos Condell de la Haza's command, and Covadonga, under Prat's command, set sail towards Iquique arriving on 10 May. To achieve the plan that Admiral Juan Williams Rebolledo had conceived, consisting of attacking the Peruvian squadron in Callao's port, he assigned as Abtaos commander Manuel Thompson, who commanded the corvette until then. Arturo Prat replaced him, and Carlos Condell de la Haza was designated Covadongas commander. On 16 May, the squadron set sail to Callao, with the intention of surprising the Peruvian warships, but the same day Peruvian monitor and armored frigate Independencia set sail from that port, towards Arica, to carry reinforcements, armaments, ammunition and provisions, so both squadrons missed each other on their trips. = Battle of Iquique and death= It was 21 May 1879, 6:30 in the morning, when the fog cleared, Covadongas lookout shouted: \\"Smoke to the north!\\". But, owing to thick marine fog, they were not able to identify the newly arrived ships, but after a few moments they thought it was the Peruvian squadron coming back. At 6:45 a.m., a sailor by Condell's side asked for the telescope, and in a moment of clarity he observed the warships' rigging and said to Condell: \\"It's the Hu√°scar and the Independencia\\". \\"What basis do you have to assert that?\\" asked Condell, and the sailor answered \\"From the shape of the platform on top of the foremast\\". Immediately Condell ordered a shot to be fired in the air to warn Esmeralda, still anchored in the port. The ships were indeed Independencia and Hu√°scar. In that same moment, the Peruvian admiral Miguel Grau Seminario addressed his crew: \\"Crewmembers and Sailors of the Hu√°scar, Iquique is at sight, there are our afflicted fellow countrymen from Tarapac√°, and also the enemy, still unpunished. It's time to punish them! I hope you will know how. Remember how our forces distinguished in Junin, the 2nd of May, Abtao, Ayacucho and other battlefields, to win us our glorious and dignified independence, and our consecrated and brilliant laurels of freedom. No matter the outcome, Peru will not fall. For our fatherland, Long Live Peru!\\" Carlos Condell de la Haza warned Prat, and he, seeing the difference between their forces and the enemy's, pronounced his famous impassioned speech in front of his brothers in arms: > Lads, the battle will be unfair, but, cheer and have courage. Never has our > flag been hauled down before the enemy and I hope this will not be the > occasion for it to happen. From my part, I assure you that as long as I > live, this flag will remain flying in its place, and if I should die, my > officers will know how to fulfill their duties. Long Live Chile! Esmeralda was an old wooden corvette weighing 850 tons and 200 horsepower, with eight 40-pound cannons, four 30-pounders and two of 6 pounds. When the action began, Prat ordered Condell to follow his course and Covadonga met with Esmeralda and La Mar in the middle of the bay. With the bugler sounding Action Stations, the crew took their places. At 8:15, the first volley hit between the ships, and Prat ordered Esmeralda to start moving, followed by Covadonga. At 8:25 a second volley fell and a shot from Hu√°scar hit fully on the starboard (right) side, passed through Esmeraldas side, killing the surgeon Videla, beheading his assistant, and mortally wounding another sailor. The transporter Lamar hoisted the US flag and fled to the south, and Condell changed his course and went behind that ship. Grau ordered Independencia to block Covadonga and Lamars way. Prat observed Condell's action and asked himself: \\"What is Condell doing?\\" Condell ignored Prat's order and followed Lamar, but the warship did get away from Covadonga, and Independencia under control of Juan Guillermo Moore followed him. On the other hand, the monitor Hu√°scar weighed 1,130 tons and had armour plating 4¬Ω-inches thick, with two 300-pound cannon in a revolving turret and 11 knots maximum speed. Death of Arturo Prat. Painting by Thomas Somerscales Grau directed Independencia to chase Covadonga, while he finished Esmeralda. Prat quickly positioned the ship in front of the coast, 200 meters from it, forcing Hu√°scar to shoot with a parabolic trajectory to avoid hitting the Peruvian village, whose people gathered in crowds to watch the battle. General Buend√≠a, commander of the Peruvian garrison of Iquique, had artillery cannons placed on the beach and sent an emissary in a fast rowing boat with a warning to Hu√°scar that Esmeralda was loaded with torpedoes. Grau stopped from her and began shooting with the 300-pound cannons, not hitting her for an hour and a half, owing to the Peruvian sailors' inexperience in the handling of the monitor's Coles turret. The Chilean crew answered with their 30-pound cannons and gunfire, shots that rebounded uselessly from Hu√°scars plated armour. At the coast, the Peruvian Army garrison in the town began to bombard the Chilean ship. A grenade reached her, killing three men. Prat ordered the warship to move, slowly maneuvering at scarcely 4 knots, for her engine was defective and one the boilers had burst. He stopped 1,000 m from the city and 250 m from land, where they would stand until their sinking. This move allowed Grau to see the absence of the torpedoes that supposedly filled Esmeralda. One of Hu√°scars shots hit directly on board, beheading the ordering bugler and mutilating the gun crews. The position of Esmeralda was desperate. Arturo Prat on a Chilean stamp of 1948 At 11:30am, Admiral Grau, seeing the useless slaughter and wanting to end the combat, which had been nearly four hours long, ordered his ship to ram into Esmeralda. The monitor backed to get enough impulse and charged bow-first into starboard side of the ship. When Prat saw the enemy warship colliding into his, near the stern, he raised his sword and cried his final order: \\"Let's board, boys!\\", but due to the roar of the battle, only the Marine Artilleryman and Prat's personal escort in battle, Petty Officer Juan de Dios Aldea and Seaman Arsenio Canave heard it, and both of them and Prat jumped aboard Hu√°scar. Arsenio unfortunately slipped and fell down because of the impact, so only the two officers got to the monitor. Aldea received a burst from the artillery tower and fell mortally injured. Only Prat continued advancing, amazing the Peruvian crew with his tremendous courage. Grau gave the order to capture him alive. Prat got to the enemy's deck and advanced towards the command tower, but he was hit by a bullet, bringing him down to his knees. Another shot from a sharpshooter perched on the artillery tower struck him dead. Sinking of Esmeralda The crew of Esmeralda saw with horror their captain's sacrifice, and when Hu√°scar tried another charge, now against Esmeraldas bow, Sublieutenant Ignacio Serrano boarded Hu√°scar with ten more men, armed with machetes and rifles but they were massacred by shots from the mounted Gatling guns and the monitor's crew. Serrano was then the only survivor, having received several wounds in the groin. Grau quickly had him picked up and carried to the infirmary in a state of shock, where they left him next to the dying petty officer Aldea. A third ram, this time into the middle of Esmeralda, was fatal and sentenced the ship to death. Nobody else could jump to the other ship, as Esmeralda was already sinking. The last cannon shot was fired by Midshipman Ernesto Riquelme, while the main deck was going underwater. Grau and the Hu√°scar crew by then also heard shouts of \\"Long Live Chile! Glory and Victory!\\" from the ship's sailors. It was 12:10 pm at midday. Grau expressed grief for Prat's death and paid his respects at his own cabin. After the battle, Grau gave orders that Prat's body and those of his men were to be taken ashore for burial in Iquique and that Prat's personal possessions (diary, uniform and sword among others) were to be returned to his widow. Carmela Carvajal received the items, together with an attached letter from the Peruvian admiral, affirming his rival's personal qualities, his gentility and his high moral values. The bodies of Prat and his crew were initially laid to rest in Iquique but in 1888 their remains were transferred to a crypt under the imposing new Heroes of Iquique monument in Valparaiso's Plaza Sotomayor. In the confrontation of Iquique, Chile lost that day an old wooden ship, but Prat's death allowed the mobilization of the Chilean population to support the war, and that would be one of the factors of the Chilean victory in the War of the Pacific, the most important being the superiority of the Chilean fleet in the Pacific.

A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid 2 Mobile. Acid 2 is the sequel to the original Metal Gear Acid, with the story set sometime after the events of the previous game. Like its predecessor, it follows an alternate continuity separate from the mainline Metal Gear series. The game uses a completely new cel-shaded graphic engine, replacing the darker graphics from the first game, and features an improved gameplay system. It comes with a PSP add-on called the Solid Eye, which is a folding cardboard box with specialized lenses that fit over the PSP's screen, creating a stereoscopic image. Gameplay Gameplay remains of Metal Gear Acid 2 essentially similar to that of its predecessor: using a series of collectible trading cards based on the other Metal Gear games. There are new features, such as the SELL option for cards, allowing overstocked cards that the player cannot use to be sold for more points (in-game currency used to buy cards) and cover fire (when a player's ally is behind an enemy and has an equipped weapon in range of the target, when the player attacks, his/her ally takes a shot onto the target as well). Also added are the ability to move past doors instead of stopping when approaching, and characters can now pick up items such as weapons and card packs by simply running over them (instead of having to end movement on top of the item). The game uses a revamped engine, featuring a cel-shaded presentation, 3D equipment boxes, and new particle effects. There is a tutorial mode for beginners and a new \\"Arena\\" single-player mode that allows players to battle boss characters from previous games such as Liquid Snake and Vamp using the Acid 2 card-battling system. There are also extra missions such as \\"Sneaking\\" and \\"Elimination\\" modes. The game can be also played in the \\"Wireless Battle\\" mode (using ad hoc connection only). An additional \\"Solid Eye Theater\\" mode is to watch videos of the Japanese women seen on posters and magazines throughout the Metal Gear series, utilizing the Solid Eye attachment. =Card system= The gameplay system consists primarily of the usage of cards (obtainable in-game, through a card shop, or other means such as codes or game completion). These cards have a variety of effects for the player, and most can double as a movement card (represented in the form of blocks, referenced as BLKS in-game). Activation conditions include USE (where they can be used immediately if all conditions are met), EQUIP (where cards take up an equipment slot), or MOVE (allowing the player to move). Most cards can move the player 3 BLKS, but some cards allow more (or less), and a number of cards are dedicated movement cards, most of which are based on soldiers from the previous Metal Gear games. COST is also an important factor, as it affects turn order and is represented in the form of a small counter. It can be summarized as the time taken for the player to perform an action, so if the player has a cost of 0 and an enemy has the cost of 1, the player will go first, regardless of the number of turns he/she has had (unless a condition or card effect states otherwise). If the player (or enemy) builds his/her cost up to the amount that another character already has, that puts him behind the character with the equal cost in the turn order. COST build up varies by card and is indicated in the upper-right corner of the card. There are 565 cards, more than twice the number of the original game, including upgradeable cards. Cards vary drastically: some allow the player to attack (Weapon Cards), some provide support such as the ability to dodge an attack (Support Cards), giving the player the ability to perform an action such as the \\"hold-up\\" move that incapacitates enemies when the player threatens them from behind or to choke an enemy unconscious (Action Cards), to use items like rations or body armor (Item Cards), or special character cards with varying effects based on the characters they represent (either all from Metal Gear games or other Konami games) such as the Sniper Wolf card with gives the player 40% more accuracy on equipped weapon for one use (Character Cards). Some cards reduce cost or give an extra turns or action points (each card takes up one action point). =Solid Eye= Acid 2 ships with a viewing device called the Solid Eye. It is a folding cardboard box that slides over the PSP, separating the image with a divider in the center. The game is playable with or without the Solid Eye. When switched into Solid Eye mode, the game displays two images on either side of the PSP screen. When used with the Solid Eye, the images overlap and produce a pop-out, 3D effect. The game and manual warn that using this device for extended periods of time may lead to eyestrain, and prolonged use is not recommended. As more cards are collected, videos are unlocked in the Solid Eye Theater, available from the game's menu. These videos are only viewable as Solid Eye footage, and showcase videos of Japanese women as well as cut scenes from Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Acid 2 is capable of communicating with Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2. By connecting a PS2 to a PSP, it is possible to take photos in Subsistence and transfer them to a PSP for viewing in 3D with the Solid Eye. The manual that is included with the American version of the game is significantly thinned down, and as such, does not contain a specific guide on how to utilize this feature. Instructions can be found in the downloadable manual.http://www.konami- data.com/downloads/manuals/mga2_manual.pdf Plot =Story= The story begins with a man known as Snake, a young woman named Consuela Alvarez, and two pilots named Dave Copeland and Roddy Louiz, flying into the United States illegally when they are arrested by the FBI. After being caught, Snake is pressed into a mission by his captor, an FBI agent named Dalton. Snake agrees to the job to free his friends and clear his name with Dalton. Snake's initial objective is to infiltrate a research facility operated by SaintLogic (called \\"StrateLogic\\" in the Japanese version), a military arms manufacturer, located on an isolated North American island. Dalton is investigating SaintLogic for inhuman actions towards children, and utilizes Snake's abilities to infiltrate SaintLogic and uncover the truth behind their business practices. Shortly into Snake's mission, Dalton's authority is exceeded by General Wiseman, an official with the United States Department of Defense. Snake slowly learns that Wiseman's involvement is in response to a SaintLogic executive Thomas Koppelthorn, who has made demands that the United States release several prisoners and has threatened to use nuclear weapons. Wiseman proceeds to offer Snake information regarding his past in return for Snake's assistance in eliminating the present SaintLogic threat. Snake teams with Venus, Wiseman's own operative, and together they search SaintLogic for Koppelthorn. Soon after, a test is initiated, and Snake becomes aware that SaintLogic has developed a Metal Gear which Koppelthorn has taken control of. It later becomes evident that Koppelthorn is seeking revenge for an incident that occurred three years before, and among his demands are that the United States release Snake to him. General Wiseman constantly comments on a Lucinda File, which he wants Venus to obtain. As Snake and Venus search SaintLogic's research facilities, they encounter a researcher, Dr. Takiyama, and a young girl, Lucy, who proceed to join Koppelthorn's scheme. Before crossing to the building where Koppelthorn is located, Snake and Venus are met by Metal Gear Kodoque from the first Acid which was rescued before being destroyed during the events of the last game. Upon finally meeting with Koppelthorn, Metal Gear Chaioth Ha Qadesh, Lucy, and Dr. Takiyama, Snake and Venus learn that Koppelthorn has been 'resurrecting' his wife in the form of a young girl, Lucy. Before the final fight against Koppelthorn, it is revealed that Snake is actually a Model 3 Test Subject who was created in SaintLogic labs by Koppelthorn's wife. Snake then learns that he is a clone of Solid Snake, who SaintLogic recovered after the Lobito Incident. Snake was sent to Serena to quell an uprising of Model 2 subjects, better known as the Praulia Massacre. The Lucinda File is unmasked to be a log of the events of the incident in Serena. After Snake and Venus defeat Koppelthorn, Lucy reveals herself to not actually be a rebirth of Lucinda Koppelthorn, but rather her own being with the consciousness of Lucinda. Lucy then declares the truth about Lucinda, who had helped Snake to escape SaintLogic and wanted to die because of her inhumane actions. Lucy kills Tom Koppelthorn and takes control of Metal Gear Chaioth Ha Qadesh acting on her true nature of being test subject designed to kill. Snake and Venus must once again defeat Chaioth Ha Qadesh and Lucy as well. Snake and Venus next learn that the SaintLogic facility is wired with explosives, and learn the location of Dr. Takiyama as well as the Lucinda File. After recovering both, Venus pulls a gun on Snake at Wiseman's command. Wiseman announces that he was responsible for the Praulia Massacre because he wanted to hurry along the project with a field test. An ethnic uprising that was occurring in Serena at the time was an opportune time to test the SaintLogic subjects. This initial test did not provide sufficient information concerning the limits of the test subjects, and Wiseman ordered for the subjects to be pushed to their limits. After the massacre, Wiseman arranged for Snake to flee to the United States. Dalton was informed of Snake's entering the country and, as desired by Wiseman, apprehended Snake. Wiseman's original plan was for Dalton and Snake to attempt to infiltrate SaintLogic but become tangled in the facilities guards. At this time Wiseman was to have Venus work her way through SaintLogic and recover the Lucinda File, and place any blame on Dalton and Snake. Venus is then revealed to be a test subject, newer than Snake, who was placed in the care of Wiseman after the activities in Serena. Snake learns that Venus was the cause of his amnesia, as she had shot him during the Praulia Massacre. Snake and Venus duel and, following Venus's defeat, work their way out of the SaintLogic buildings with Dr. Takiyama. Venus and Dr. Takiyama escape however Snake is trapped inside. Venus and Takiyama escape the building safely, and outside SaintLogic witness Metal Gear Chaioth Ha Qadesh return to life. The U.S. military, which has been called in to secure SaintLogic, fires upon Metal Gear and a missile from its rear launches, and lands in the ocean a short distance away. It is revealed in a cutscene that Snake was in the launcher instead of a missile and utilized it to escape, breaking most bones in his body. The game ends with Dr. Takiyama and Venus safely recovering from the SaintLogic incident, with General Wiseman arrested and facing charges of war crimes. Snake, who has recovered extremely quickly, is confronted by Dalton, who provides him with a United States identity, his friends, and $15 million. In the North American and European versions, several illustrations that accompany the end credits show what happens to the game's main characters after the incident. Wiseman is shown being led away by law enforcement personnel, but his manner remains undaunted, implying perhaps that there is yet a way for him out of his predicament. Dalton gets dressed down by a superior at the FBI, although he retains a smug demeanor not unlike Wiseman's. Dr. Takiyama is merely shown looking pensive in the helicopter that carries her off the island. And in a vignette that could have been taken much later after the events of the SaintLogic incident, Venus is seen manning the checkout counter at a supermarket, hinting at her quiet assimilation into everyday life. =Characters= * Snake - The primary protagonist in Acid 2. Prior to the events of the game, Snake contracts amnesia and is unable to recall his past. Arriving in the United States illegally, Snake is captured by Dalton and is forced to investigate SaintLogic's practices. He is then placed under Wiseman's command, with whom he cooperates only to get his memory back. He eventually learns he is not the \\"real\\" Solid Snake per se, but rather a full-grown clone of Solid Snake from the original Acid, created from cell samples taken from the Lobito Island incident. As with Solid Snake in the main series, Snake is voiced by David Hayter in English and Akio ≈åtsuka in Japanese. * Venus - Female partner to Snake. She also suffers from memory loss and feels no remorse for killing. Her suit sleeves contain shuriken-type devices, although they are only seen used in cutscenes. She was sent to the SaintLogic facility by Wiseman to contain the situation there. Originally, Wiseman never planned to make his presence or Venus' presence known to Snake and Dalton. Venus is voiced by Kathryn Fiore in English and Rika Komatsu in Japanese. * Dalton - An ex-FBI agent who captures Snake in the beginning of the game and forces him to infiltrate the SaintLogic facility to retrieve files on SaintLogic's business practices. * Wiseman - General with the United States Department of Defense. He claims to know about Snake's and Venus's past, and offers it in return for their assistance with his operation. He prefers efficiency over morality, and appears to have a hidden agenda. * Dr. Thomas Koppelthorn - Vice President of SaintLogic, who demands the release of 12 high-ranking officials or he will launch a nuclear attack. He also demands that the SaintLogic president, Rodzinski, hand over the Lucinda File to him. Although this is Dr. Koppelthorn's first appearance in a Metal Gear game, previous games have referred to the character. In Metal Gear: Ghost Babel, Mei Ling attempts to quote from him, only to get interrupted by Snake every time. In Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, the Koppelthorn Engine is a VR simulation program that actually serves as a gateway to parallel worlds and is mentioned in one of the Snake Tales, External Gazer. * Rodzinski - President of SaintLogic. Rodzinski has possession of the Lucinda file and is unwilling to reveal it to anyone. It is later discovered that Rodzinski was involved in the events of the Lucinda file and does not wish their contents to be publicized. * B.B. - Self-proclaimed hacker extraordinaire. B.B. views the incident as some kind of game. He occasionally contacts Snake though the Codec with advice. His image is firewalled and cannot be seen. In the end, Wiseman sends his troops after him revealing that B.B. stood for BlackBoard and that B.B. was operating out of a small computer lab in St. Crescendo Elementary School, located in the state of Virginia. However, B.B. managed to hypnotize the President just in time through his monitor and arranged for the DoD to be sent in to arrest Wiseman. * Lucinda Koppelthorn - Thomas Koppelthorn's deceased wife. She was killed in the Praulia Massacre and left a record of what the test subjects really did, this record is called the \\"Lucinda File\\". Snake is accused by Koppelthorn of having murdered his wife, when, in reality, Lucinda actually wished to kill herself for performing extensive experiments on humans (which usually destroyed their body and sometimes their mind). * Vince - Chief of security at SaintLogic hired by Rodinski. He wields an RPG-7. Vince is voiced by James C. Mathis III in English and Mahito ≈åba in Japanese. * - Researcher at SaintLogic who assists Koppelthorn out of pity. It was implied in the story that Dr. Takiyama had performed 'special favors' for Rodzinski and Koppelthorn to get to where she is in the company today. * Lucy - A young girl who is always with Dr. Takiyama and appears to be timid. In reality, she is the reincarnation of Lucinda Koppelthorn, and is bound to the EGO system. * Harab Serap - Harab Serap is one of the test subjects in SaintLogic. Once he was released, he attempted to kill all those who tormented him, and abused him. In the Kabbalah faith, Harab and Serap are two Sephiroth. Harab Serap is voiced by Peter Lurie in English and Kazunari Tanaka in Japanese. * Golab - Golab is a test subject who carries a large tube filled with oil or some kind of gasoline. Golab claims to be Snake's brother, which is confirmed in later events, seeing as they are both test subjects. Golab is another of the Kabbalah's Sephiroth. Golab is voiced by Roger Rose in English and Naoki Imamura in Japanese. * Chaigidiel - Another of SaintLogic's test subjects. Chaigidiel's specialty is in hypnosis and psychic powers, which he can use to walk on ceilings and take control of one of the characters. He is armed with an M79 grenade launcher. Yet another Sephiroth of the Kabbalah faith. Chaigidiel is voiced by Philip Proctor in English and Naoki Tatsuta in Japanese. Release The Western versions include ten new cards not included in the Japanese release, six of which are based on Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots: namely Solid Snake, Otacon, Metal Gear Mk. II, GEKKO, Solid Eye, and No Smoking. The remaining four were fan made submissions selected in a Konami sponsored contest by four online publications (Game Informer, IGN, GameSpy, and 1UP.com), which were an alternate Naked Snake card from MGS3, a Banana Skin, Possessed Arm, and Emma's Parrot. The game's soundtrack was composed by Akihiro Honda, Hiroshi Tanabe, Nobuko Toda and Shuichi Kobori. It was released along with the Metal Gear Acid soundtrack on December 21, 2005, in the two- disc compilation Metal Gear Acid 1 and 2 Original Soundtrack. Reception Metal Gear Acid 2 received generally positive reviews from critics and the public. It currently holds a MetaCritic score of 80, with a separate User Rating of 8.2.

In the , Mount Gravatt had a population of 3,366 people.  Geography  The suburb is situated in the south-east of the city and was one of Brisbane's largest. This was before it was divided into Mount Gravatt East, Upper Mount Gravatt and Mount Gravatt South; the last being renamed Wishart in the early 1990s.  History  The hill was named Mount Gravatt in 1840 by surveyor Robert Dixon after Lieutenant George Gravatt who was the commander of the Moreton Bay penal colony from May to July 1839. Gravatt was later transferred to India where he died in 1843. Mount Gravatt State School was opened on 29 June 1874. In 1888, 3 sections of 107 allotments, 6 and 7 acres were advertised to be auctioned on 24 November as 'The Abdington Estate Mount Gravatt'. Crowd observing the first tram through the suburb in 1951 Between 1953 and 1969 electric trams ran from the suburb into Brisbane's Central Business District (CBD) along Logan Road. As Mount Gravatt was the end of the line, part of the area was known locally as \\"The Terminus\\". Mount Gravatt East State School (in neighbouring Mount Gravatt East) was opened on 29 August 1955. Mount Gravatt State High School opened in 1960. St Agnes Catholic Primary School opened on 1 January 1962. The Mount Gravatt Library opened in 1967. St Catherine's School (in neighbouring Wishart) opened on 4 March 1971. Griffith University (in neighbouring Nathan) opened its main campus in 1975. Yarranlea State School opened in Yarranlea (in the Toowoomba Region) on 22 January 1883 and closed on 9 December 1977. In 1979 it was relocated to Mount Gravatt College of Advanced Education (a teacher training institution) as a museum school. It was then relocated to the Griffith University campus and reopened on 27 January 1987, known as Old Yarranlea State School) to provide teacher training in a one-teacher school environment (typical of schools in many regional communities of Queensland).To that end, enrolments in the school were limited to 18 students. However, the school was closed at the end 2013 due to having fewer than 150 schools and is within five kilometres of three state schools. Due to the support of parents and the public, it reopened as Yarranlea Primary School (an independent school) in July 2014. In the , Mount Gravatt had a population of 3,366 people.  Transport  Since the closure of the tram network in 1969, the public transport has been provided by buses operated by Brisbane Transport and a local bus company the Mount Gravatt Bus Service. The South East Busway is connected by a service from Mount Gravatt Central to the Busway terminal at Griffith University.  Facilities  The Mount Gravatt Showgrounds are an important centre for cultural and community activities and the site of the annual Mount Gravatt Show, an agricultural fair. The grounds are positioned on Logan Road, opposite the mega-church, Hillsong Brisbane Campus (formerly known as Garden City Christian Church).

The company, whose brand still appears today on a few products (e.g., Cheez-Its), was purchased by Keebler Company in 1996, which was subsequently purchased by Kellogg Company in 2000. Around that time, Sunshine Biscuits was headquartered in Elmhurst, Illinois, the same town in which Keebler was located until 2001. At the time of its purchase by Keebler, Sunshine Biscuits was the third largest cookie baker in the United States.  History  Until the late 19th century, the biscuit/cracker industry was made up of small independent local bakeries preparing products and selling them in bulk. The barrels and crates of biscuits were delivered by horse and wagon, set out in the grocery store and sold to the consumer by the measure. In 1890, a group of thirty-three Midwest and western bakers combined to form the American Biscuit & Manufacturing Company. This consolidation was done primarily to compete with United States Baking Company, another Midwest group and the New York Biscuit Company, an east coast conglomerate. Soon the American Biscuit and New York Biscuit groups were opening bakeries and lowering prices in each other's area in an attempt to eliminate the competition. Finally in February 1898 the competing groups combined 114 factories and formed the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco). Although Joseph Loose was a member of Nabisco's Board of Directors, in 1902 along with his brother Jacob and John H. Wiles, he liquidated his holdings in National Biscuit Company and formed the Loose-Wiles Biscuit Company in Kansas City. They envisioned a factory which would be filled with sunlight and so they adopted the name SUNSHINE for their products. Soon they began expanding and opened new plants in Boston and then New York. In 1912 Loose-Wiles opened their \\"Thousand Window\\" bakery in the Long Island City neighborhood of New York City, which remained the largest bakery building in the world until 1955. The plant was closed in 1965 and the production was moved to Sayreville, New Jersey. Loose-Wiles never registered their \\"Sunshine\\" brand name and therefore spent much effort in the first forty years trying to dissuade other companies from using the word \\"sunshine\\" or any related word on their product or in their advertising. Since Loose-Wiles claim was not based on a registered mark, they often had to investigate when and where the other company first used the word to determine which company had first claim so as not to lose their right to the name \\"Sunshine\\" for their own products. Finally in 1946, the Loose-Wiles Company officially changed its name to Sunshine Biscuit, Inc. The early part of the company's history was dominated by developing new items and acquiring established brands from other smaller companies. Many of the products and their names are similar to those of their largest competitor, the National Biscuit Company. For example, Nabisco's first individually packaged cracker was named \\"Uneeda\\". Loose-Wile's cracker was \\"Takhoma\\". Loose-Wiles made \\"Trumps Cookies\\". Nabisco produced \\"Aces\\". Sunshine Biscuit had \\"Animal Crackers\\" and \\"Toy Cookies\\". Nabisco produced \\"Barnum's Animals\\". The American Tobacco Company purchased the company in 1966. It was then sold to G. F. Industries, a privately held California company, and finally merged with the Keebler Company in 1996.  Products  Sunshine Biscuits made the Hydrox chocolate sandwich cream cookie, before it was discontinued in 1999. They were reintroduced in 2015, and are now made by Leaf Brands. Today, Sunshine is best known for the Cheez-It snack crackers, which are still marketed under the Sunshine brand, as are Krispy Crackers saltines. However, six well-known Sunshine brands were discontinued after the merger with Keebler: Chip-A-Roos, Chocolate Nugget cookies, Chocolate Fudge Cookies, Lemon Coolers, Golden Raisin Biscuits (thru 1996, similar to Garibaldi biscuits) and Golden Fruit Biscuits. Sunshine originated Vienna Fingers cookies, which are now sold under the Keebler brand. = Currently branded products = *Cheez-It snack crackers *Krispy saltine crackers *Krispy Soup & Oyster crackers *Nut Sundae Cookie = Brand ownership change = * Hydrox (chocolate sandwich cookies) ‚Äì Sold to Leaf Brands in 2014 * Lemon Coolers (cookies) - Trademark by Texan Foods LLC in 2016 * Yum Yums (coconut caramel cookies) - Trademark by Texan Foods LLC in 2016 * Hi Ho Crackers - Trademark by Texan Foods LLC in 2016 * Sunshine Nut Sundaes (marshmallow cookies) They also made a snack cracker line called American Heritage, Cherry Coolers, Fig Bars (not to be confused with Fig Newtons) and International Snacks, a line of sandwich cookies with two flavors of creme in every cookie.

The paradox states that an increase in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy.These two formulations are given in Campbell R. McConnell (1960: 261‚Äì62), emphasis added: \\"By attempting to increase its rate of saving, society may create conditions under which the amount it can actually save is reduced. This phenomenon is called the paradox of thrift ... [T]hrift, which has always been held in high esteem in our economy, now becomes something of a social vice.\\" Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that which is true of the parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy. It had been stated as early as 1714 in The Fable of the Bees,Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, \\"Chapter 23. Notes on Merchantilism, the Usury Laws, Stamped Money and Theories of Under-consumption\\" and similar sentiments date to antiquity.See history section for further discussion. It was popularized by John Maynard Keynes and is a central component of Keynesian economics. It has formed part of mainstream economics since the late 1940s. The paradox The argument begins from the observation that in equilibrium, total income must equal total output. Assuming that income has a direct effect on saving, an increase in the autonomous component of saving, other things being equal, will move the equilibrium point at which income equals output to a lower value, thereby inducing a decline in saving that may more than offset the original increase. In this form it represents a prisoner's dilemma as saving is beneficial to each individual but deleterious to the general population. This is a \\"paradox\\" because it runs contrary to intuition. Someone unaware of the paradox of thrift would fall into a fallacy of composition and assume that what seems to be good for an individual within the economy will be good for the entire population. However, exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a \\"rainy day\\", and yet not be good for the economy as a whole. This paradox can be explained by analyzing the place, and impact, of increased savings in an economy. If a population decides to save more money at all income levels, then total revenues for companies will decline. This decreased demand causes a contraction of output, giving employers and employees lower income. Eventually the population's total saving will have remained the same or even declined because of lower incomes and a weaker economy. This paradox is based on the proposition, put forth in Keynesian economics, that many economic downturns are demand-based. History While the paradox of thrift was popularized by Keynes, and is often attributed to him, it was stated by a number of others prior to Keynes, and the proposition that spending may help and saving may hurt an economy dates to antiquity; similar sentiments occur in the Bible verse: which has found occasional use as an epigram in underconsumptionist writings.English, Irish and Subversives Among the Dismal Scientists, Noel Thompson, Nigel Allington, 2010, p. 122: \\"A suggestion that a more equal distribution of income might be a remedy for general stagnation ‚Äì and that excess saving can be harmful ‚Äì is implicit in the quotation from the Old Testament on the Reply to Mr. Say [by John Cazenove (1788‚Äì1879)].\\"A Reply to Mr. Say‚Äôs Letters to Mr. Malthus, by John Cazenove, uses the verse as an epigram.Studies in economics, William Smart, 1895, p. 249 Keynes himself notes the appearance of the paradox in The Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits (1714) by Bernard Mandeville, the title itself hinting at the paradox, and Keynes citing the passage: Keynes suggests Adam Smith was referring to this passage when he wrote \\"What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great Kingdom.\\" The problem of underconsumption and oversaving, as they saw it, was developed by underconsumptionist economists of the 19th century, and the paradox of thrift in the strict sense that \\"collective attempts to save yield lower overall savings\\" was explicitly stated by John M. Robertson in his 1892 book The Fallacy of Saving, writing: Similar ideas were forwarded by William Trufant Foster and Waddill Catchings in the 1920s in The Dilemma of Thrift. Keynes distinguished between business activity/investment (\\"Enterprise\\") and savings (\\"Thrift\\") in his Treatise on Money (1930): He stated the paradox of thrift in The General Theory, 1936: The theory is referred to as the \\"paradox of thrift\\" in Samuelson's influential Economics of 1948, which popularized the term. =Paradox of thrift according to Balances Mechanics= The paradox of thrift formally can be well described as a circuit paradox using the terms of Balances Mechanics developed by the German economist Wolfgang St√ºtzel (German: Saldenmechanik): It is about saving by cut of expenses, which always leads to a revenue surplus of the individual, so to saving of money. But once the totality (in the meaning of every each) saves at expenses, the revenues of economy only decline. * Partial sentence: For individual economic entities or a partial group of economy actors it is valid: the lower the expenses the higher the revenue surplus. * Size mechanics: The expenses decline of a partial group of economy actors can only lead to a revenue surplus if the complementary group does or accepts an expenses surplus. * Global sentence: A general decline of expenses always leads the totality to a decline of revenues and never to a revenue surplus.Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Volkswirtschaftliche Saldenmechanik. Mohr Siebeck, (2. Auflage) T√ºbingen 2011. S. 74. Related concepts The paradox of thrift has been related to the debt deflation theory of economic crises, being called \\"the paradox of debt\\"Paradox of thrift, Paul Krugman ‚Äì people save not to increase savings, but rather to pay down debt. As well, a paradox of toil and a paradox of flexibility have been proposed: A willingness to work more in a liquidity trap and wage flexibility after a debt deflation shock may lead not only to lower wages, but lower employment. During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen discussed the \\"Paradox of deleveraging\\" described by economist Hyman Minsky: \\"Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn‚Äôt take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms‚Äîand indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state‚Äînevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\\"Federal Reserve-Janet Yellen-A Minsky Meltdown-April 2009 Criticisms Within mainstream economics, non-Keynesian economists, particularly neoclassical economists, criticize this theory on three principal grounds. The first criticism is that, following Say's law and the related circle of ideas, if demand slackens, prices will fall (barring government intervention), and the resulting lower price will stimulate demand (though at lower profit or cost ‚Äì possibly even lower wages). This criticism in turn has been questioned by New Keynesian economists, who reject Say's law and instead point to evidence of sticky prices as a reason why prices do not fall in recession; this remains a debated point. The second criticism is that savings represent loanable funds, particularly at banks, assuming the savings are held at banks, rather than currency itself being held (\\"stashed under one's mattress\\"). Thus an accumulation of savings yields an increase in potential lending, which will lower interest rates and stimulate borrowing. So a decline in consumer spending is offset by an increase in lending, and subsequent investment and spending. Two caveats are added to this criticism. Firstly, if savings are held as cash, rather than being loaned out (directly by savers, or indirectly, as via bank deposits), then loanable funds do not increase, and thus a recession may be caused ‚Äì but this is due to holding cash, not to saving per se.See section 9.9 and 9.11 http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/cbm.htm Secondly, banks themselves may hold cash, rather than loaning it out, which results in the growth of excess reserves ‚Äì funds on deposit but not loaned out. This is argued to occur in liquidity trap situations, when interest rates are at a zero lower bound (or near it) and savings still exceed investment demand. Within Keynesian economics, the desire to hold currency rather than loan it out is discussed under liquidity preference. Third, the paradox assumes a closed economy in which savings are not invested abroad (to fund exports of local production abroad). Thus, while the paradox may hold at the global level, it need not hold at the local or national level: if one nation increases savings, this can be offset by trading partners consuming a greater amount relative to their own production, i.e., if the saving nation increases exports, and its partners increase imports. This criticism is not very controversial, and is generally accepted by Keynesian economists as well,The paradox of thrift ‚Äî for real, Paul Krugman, July 7, 2009 who refer to it as \\"exporting one's way out of a recession\\". They further note that this frequently occurs in concert with currency devaluationDevaluing History, Paul Krugman, November 24, 2010 (hence increasing exports and decreasing imports), and cannot work as a solution to a global problem, because the global economy is a closed system ‚Äì not every nation can increase net exports. =Austrian School criticism= The Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek criticized the paradox in a 1929 article, \\"The 'Paradox' of Savings\\", questioning the paradox as proposed by Foster and Catchings. Hayek, and later Austrian School economists agree that if a population saves more money, total revenues for companies will decline, but they deny the assertion that lower revenues lead to lower economic growth, understanding that the additional savings are used to create more capital to increase production. Once the new, more productive structure of capital has reorganized inside of the current structure, the real costs of production is reduced for most firms. Some criticisms argue that using accumulated capital to increase production is an act which requires spending, and therefore the Austrian argument does not disprove the paradox.

Early life  Dirksen was born into a recently-ennobled familySnyder, Louis, Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1976 page 68. that had been Prussian civil servants for generations. His father, Willibald, was ennobled by Emperor Wilhelm I in 1887 and was granted a large estate together with Gr√∂ditzberg (now Grodziec Castle) in Silesia as a reward for his services to the House of Hohenzollern.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 478. Willibald was a conservative nationalist who, after his retirement, held a seat in the Reichstag for the anti-Semitic Reichspartei and was described as a \\"fanatical admirer\\" of Wilhelm II, whom he visited regularly during the Dutch exile. Dirksen's mother, Viktoria, came from a wealthy banking family and was once helpful to Adolf Hitler, which benefited Dirksen's career during Nazi Germany. In his memoirs, Dirksen boasted that he was \\"proud of my purely Germanic blood\\", as the Dirksen family had been ennobled in 1887 \\"before a whole batch of more or less Jew-tainted families were ennobled by the liberalistic Emperor Frederick III\\" in 1888.Wistrich, Robert Who's Who In Nazi Germany, London:Routledge, 2013 page 43 As the Dirksens were parvenu nobility, unlike the ancient Junker families, they felt very insecure, and from the age of five onward, Herbert was forced to undergo a strict training regime to produce an \\"exemplary bearing\\" to allow him to be accepted by the Junkers.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 pages 478‚Äì479. Dirsken had wanted to enter the exclusive Ausw√§rtiges Amt (Foreign Office), but his father forced him to enter the Prussian civil service to prepare him to manage the family's estate in Silesia. As a university student at Heidelberg, the snobbish Dirksen joined the most exclusive fraternity whose membership were mostly aristocrats, which was a source of considerable pride to him.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 479. In 1905, he graduated with a Referendar (junior barrister) legal degree, and in 1907, he went on a tour around the world. After his graduation from university, Dirksen become a reserve officer with the Third Guard Ulan regiment, based in Potsdam, which he always noted accepted only men from the aristocracy as officers. After working as an assistant judge, in 1910, Dirksen went on a four-month trip to Rhodesia, South Africa and German East Africa, where he was thinking about settling. During World War I, Dirksen served in the German Army as a lieutenant and won the Iron Cross, Second Class. The American historian Carl Schorske described Dirksen as a \\"correct and proper aristocrat with the right connections\\" but also a man who was slavishly loyal to those who held power. Entering the Ausw√§rtiges Amt in 1917, Dirksen served in the Hague (1917), Kiev (1918‚Äì1919) and in Warsaw (1920‚Äì1921).  Enemy of Poland  In April 1920, Dirksen arrived in Warsaw to take up the post of charg√© d'affaires. As the charg√© d'affaires of the German embassy in Warsaw, Dirksen's relations with the Poles were extremely difficult. As Germany had no ambassador stationed at its embassy in Warsaw, Dirksen as the charg√© d'affaires was in effect the ambassador to Poland. A measure of his antipathy to Poles can be seen in that the chapter of his 1950 memoirs dealing with his time in Warsaw, virtually all of Dirksen's comments about Poland and Poles are negative.Schechtman, Joseph Review of Moscow, London, Tokyo pages 662‚Äì664 from The Western Political Quarterly Volume 5, No. 4, December 1952 page 662. In his memoirs, Dirksen wrote that he \\"shared the deep-seated feeling of superiority over the Pole inherent in the German\\". In May 1921, a plebiscite to decide the status of Silesia led to fighting between the Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia, both of whom were supported by their respective national governments, which caused strained relations between Berlin and Warsaw. As someone who had grown in Silesia, Dirksen's sympathies were completely with the Germans, which led him to insist that all of Silesia belonged to Germany and none of the parts of Silesia that voted to join Poland should be allowed to leave Germany. In October 1921, Dirksen left Warsaw to head up the Polish desk at the Ausw√§rtiges Amt. From May 1923 to February 1925, Dirksen served as German consul in the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk, Poland). The fourteenth of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points had announced that Poland should have its independence restored with secure access to the Baltic Sea. Taking up that point, the Poles had pressed at the Paris Peace Conference to annex Danzig, despite being mostly German, but instead, the Allies compromised by creating the Free City of Danzig, an independent city-state under the protection of the League of Nations in which Poland was granted certain special rights. Most people in Danzig wished to rejoin Germany, but the Poles were unwilling to see any change in Danzig's status. As German consul in Danzig, Dirksen often clashed with the Poles. As consul in Danzig, Dirksen played a prominent role in the \\"postbox war\\", a lengthy struggle over whatever the postboxes in Danzig should be painted red and white (the colours of Poland) or red, white and black (the colours of the right in Germany; red, black and yellow were the colors of the left in Germany). The selection of colours was a victory for the right-wing inclinations of the Danzig Senate. that governed the Free City of Danzig. As the head of the Polish sub-desk within the Eastern Desk at the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, Dirksen played a key role as an aide to Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann in formulating German policy towards Poland, and in 1925 Dirksen was one of the leading advocates of using economic pressure to force Poland to return the Polish Corridor, Danzig and Upper Silesia to Germany.Post, Gaines The Civil-Military Fabric of Weimar Foreign Policy, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973 pages 33 & 72‚Äì73. In early 1925, Dirksen wrote that the Polish Corridor and Upper Silesia would not be returned unless Poland was \\"weak\\", which led him to suggest that Germany and the \\"Anglo-Saxon powers\\" should follow a strategy of weakening the Polish economy to make Poland as militarily as weak as possible.Post, Gaines The Civil- Military Fabric of Weimar Foreign Policy, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973 page 33. Though the Ausw√§rtiges Amt knew that there was no evidence that Poland was seeking war with Germany, the Wilhelmstrasse seized upon any rumors of Polish military movements towards the German frontier to portray Poland as an aggressive and expansionist state that was a menace to the peace of Europe, which was part of a broader public relations campaign waged in Europe and the United States to emphasise the theme of \\"Polish chauvinism and racial hatred\\".Post, Gaines The Civil-Military Fabric of Weimar Foreign Policy, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973 page 32 Dirksen had successfully argued that Germany's chances of regaining the Polish Corridor, Danzig and Upper Silesia would be better if world opinion was turned against Poland. In a debate within Ausw√§rtiges Amt, Carl Schubert, the State Secretary of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, argued against making loans to Germany conditional on the return of the lost territories and wrote that \\"only force\\" would force the Poles to return the Corridor and Upper Silesia.Post, Gaines The Civil-Military Fabric of Weimar Foreign Policy, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973 page 34. Schubert argued that since war with Poland was not yet practical, Germany should make loans to Poland under onerous conditions with high-interest rates to weaken Poland economically and thereby reduce the Polish military budget until Germany had rearmed, when Germany would take back the lost lands by war. Dirksen, however, also agreed that taking back the lands lost to Poland was \\"inconceivable without force\\", but argued that any sort of German loans to Poland would strengthen Poland and successfully maintained to Stresemann that Germany should not make any loans to Poland but should try to persuade other nations not to makes loans to Poland. Following Dirksen's recommendation, Stresemann ordered Friedrich Sthamer, the German ambassador to the Court of St. James's, to lobby Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, to ask him to pressure British banks into not making any loans to Poland. Sthamer was successful and reported to Berlin that Norman felt that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh on Germany and was willing to support Germans efforts to revise Versailles by denying Poland loans. In November 1925, Dirksen lamented that war with Poland was not possible because of the Treaty of Versailles, which had disarmed Germany and also because of the Franco-Polish Alliance. He said that if only Germany was rearmed, he would be all for launching a war against Poland at once. In a memorandum to Stresemann on 29 December 1925, Dirksen argued that Germany should annex all of Poland that had belonged to Germany in 1914, and he went on to vent his anti-Polish feelings by saying that he loathed all Poles.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 63. Stresmann wrote that Germany's chances of regaining the mostly-German city of Danzig would be higher if the Germans were willing to renounce their claim on the mostly-Polish city of Pozna≈Ñ. However, Dirksen was adamant that Posen, as he insisted on calling Pozna≈Ñ, had been German and would be so again and wrote that he did not feel that Germany should compromise in any way on its claims on the lands that once been German and that the frontier should be \\"rounded off\\" somewhere to the east. When Germany signed an arbitration treaty with Poland in 1926, Dirksen noted it meant only renouncing war with Poland was \\"for the time being\\" and that from the German view, the treaty was only for public relations to portray Germany as the peaceful partner in its relations with Poland.Post, Gaines The Civil-Military Fabric of Weimar Foreign Policy, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973 page 72  Ambassador to Soviet Union  In 1928, in a major promotion, Dirksen became the Ministerial Director of the East Division of the Foreign Office. On 28 January 1928, Dirksen attended a secret conference in Berlin with General Werner von Blomberg of the Truppenamt (the disguised General Staff), who was pressing for an invasion of Poland later that year. Dirksen argued against it because under the present international conditions, \\"a German-Polish war without the intervention of France or the other powers\\" was very unlikely.Post, Gaines The Civil-Military Fabric of Weimar Foreign Policy, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973 page 211. Dirksen had to advise Blomberg politely that his belief that the \\"spirit of Locarno\\" had improved Franco-German relations to such an extent that France would disregard its alliance with Poland if Germany invade it was an illusion. Later in 1928, Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann appointed Dirksen as Germany's Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In his memoirs, Dirksen wrote that the Soviet Union and Germany \\"shared the same fate\\": \\"Both had been vanquished in the war, both were being treated as outcasts by the Allied powers. Both felt resentment or enmity to their new neighbor Poland...Both were convinced that a give-and-take was mutually adventurous\\". However, Dirksen's views towards the Soviets were entirely pragmatic, as he went on to write that as a German and therefore a \\"civilized European\\", he felt only \\"contempt and abhorrence\\" towards communism and Russians. Dirksen supported Soviet efforts to help Germany break the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by developing weapons that Versailles had forbidden. Germany was to have such as tanks and aircraft, but he wanted German-Soviet military co-operation kept within its \\"proper limits\\".Jacobsen, Jon When the Soviet Union Entered World Politics, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1994 page 214. Since 1926, when the secret German-Soviet co-operation had become public knowledge following an expos√© by The Manchester Guardian, the subject was a contentious one that had strained relations with France, which did not appreciate Germany breaking Versailles to develop forbidden weapons that would one day be used against it. Dirksen wanted the development of weapons in the Soviet Union to be handled by private German companies, working for the German state as much as possible. He feared that more revelations of German covert rearmament in the Soviet Union would cause too many difficulties with the French and hinder German efforts to have Versailles revised in its favour. From the German view, convincing France that Germany did not plan to start another world war was the key to the efforts to revise Versailles, and the fact that covert rearmament went on in the Soviet Union was not helpful to that campaign. In his first speech in Moscow, in January 1929, Dirksen hailed the First Five-Year Plan and promised that Germany would do everything within its power to help the Soviets achieve the targets set out by the plan.Jacobsen, Jon When the Soviet Union Entered World Politics, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1994 page 252. Dirksen's relations with the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin were good, as Dirksen regarded Chicherin as pro-German.Roberts, Henry \\"Maxim Litvinov\\" pages 344‚Äì377 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì39 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 350. However, in 1930, when Maxim Litvinov replaced Chicherin, Dirksen made no secret of his dislike for Litvinov, who he charged was not really a follower of the Rapallo policy as Chicherin had been and also was a Jew. However, Dirksen argued in his memoirs that Litvinov's \\"anti-German\\" foreign policy inclinations had little influence on Stalin until 1933. In 1930‚Äì31, Dirksen negotiated a set of long-term credits for German businesses willing to sell machinery to the Soviet Union.Jacobsen, Jon When the Soviet Union Entered World Politics, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1994 page 200. Despite's Dirksen's best efforts, German-Soviet relations did not develop as well as he hoped.Post, Gaines The Civil-Military Fabric of Weimar Foreign Policy, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973 page 276. Stresemann had often used the threat of Germany leaning east towards the Soviet Union as a way of getting concessions from Britain and France in his campaign to revise the Treaty of Versailles, and by the early 1930s, the Soviets had grown tired of the way in which the Germans used the threat of friendship with them for their own purposes. Moreover, by the early 1930s, the German Protestant middle classes were gripped with the fear that the German Communist Party would use the great unemployed masses made available by the Great Depression to stage a revolution. That caused much of the Protestant middle class in 1930 to start to vote for Nazi Party as the \\"party of order\\" to crush Marxism in Germany. In 1930, German Foreign Minister Julius Curtius warned Dirksen that as long as the Kremlin supported the Communists and as long as the German middle classes were obsessed with the fear of a communist revolution, which Curtius complained to be fanned by a hysterical campaign in the conservative German press, which vastly exaggerated the dangers of a communist revolution in Germany, the Reich had to keep a certain distance from the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Curtius noted that reports, which were true, that the Volga Germans suffered terribly because of the policies of forced collectivisation, imposed by the First Five-Year Plan, made it politically toxic for Germany to get too close to the Soviet Union. Dirksen still saw the Soviet Union as a \\"counterweight to the West\\" and urged Curtius not to turn back completely on the eastern pivot. He wrote that the main enemy was still Poland, and the Soviet Union was useful as a potential ally against Poland. Hitler inspired a fierce maternal love in older, upper-class women, and in the 1920s, the \\"Hitler Mothers\\" emerged. They were older women, invariably from a well-off background, who pampered Hitler like a son and indulgined him with his favorite teas and chocolates. Dirksen's mother became a \\"Hitler Mother\\", launching a salon in which Hitler could meet all of her upper-class friends, and as well as her son, the German ambassador to the Soviet Union.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 25. In early 1933, Dirksen was highly concerned that the anticommunist rhetoric of the Nazis might damage the relatively-good state of German-Soviet relations.Kershaw, Ian, Hitler: Hubris, New York: Norton, 1999, page 544. In response, Prince Bernhard von B√ºlow, the State Secretary of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, sought to reassure Dirksen, \\"The National Socialists faced with responsibility are naturally different people and follow a policy other than that which they have previously proclaimed. That's always been so and is the same with all parties\\". Despite B√ºlow's assessment, German‚ÄìSoviet relations started to decline, which left Dirksen very worried. Schorske called Dirksen \\"more than a loyal civil servant to the Nazis-a true if not ardent believer in Hitler\\". In May 1933, Dirksen had a meeting with Hitler in which he advised the F√ºhrer that he allowed relations with the Soviet Union to deteriorate to an unacceptable extent.Weinbeg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970, page 65. Much to Dirksen's disappointment, Hitler informed him that he wished for an anti- Soviet understanding with Poland, which Dirksen protested implied recognition of the German‚ÄìPolish border.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970, page 66. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg described Dirksen as \\"a vain and pompous man who believed strongly in German co-operation with whatever country he was assigned to at the moment. His memory was sometimes poor, and his predictions frequently erroneous, but his observations on the situation in countries to which he was accredited were generally accurate...Like Neurath, Dirksen wanted to maintain tension with Poland to push for revision; Hitler preferred to wait until he was ready for wider schemes\\".Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 pages 65‚Äì66. In his memoirs, Dirksen argued that there were two fractions in the Narkomindel, a \\"pro-French\\" fraction and a \\"pro-German\\" fraction, and it was not until Alfred Hugenberg's speech at the London Economic Conference in June 1933 that argued for Germany's right to colonise the Soviet Union that decided the issue for the pro-French.Mosely, Philip Review of Moscow, Tokyo, London: Twenty Years of German Foreign Policy pages 616-617 from Political Science Quarterly, Volume 67, No. 4, December 1952 page 617. In August 1933, Dirksen was warned by Soviet Premier Vyacheslav Molotov that the state of German‚ÄìSoviet relations would depend on how friendly the Germany chose to be towards the Soviet Union.Haslam, Jonathan The Soviet Union and the Struggle for Collective Security, page 22. In September 1933, a major crisis occurred in relations when journalists from Tass and Izvestia covering the Reichstag Fire trial in Leipzig were beaten up by the SA, and Hitler's response to Soviet note of protest against the assault of the Soviet journalists was an explicit threat to expel all Soviet journalists from the Reich if he ever received another note of protest again and an implicit threat to break off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union .Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 81. After being warned by the Ausw√§rtiges Amt that trade with the Soviet Union provided Germany with raw materials needed for rearmament, Hitler took certain steps to reduce tension with the Soviet Union and did not break off diplomatic relations with Moscow, as he had considering, but at the same time, he made it clear that \\"a restoration of the German-Russian relationship would be impossible\\". As Dirksen continued to press Hitler for a rapprochement with the Soviet Union, Hitler decided to make him his new ambassador in Japan.  Ambassador to Japan  In October 1933, he became the German Ambassador to Japan. On 18 October 1933, Dirksen had met Hitler and gained the impression that Hitler favoured the recognition of Manchukuo.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 pages 128-129. Hitler had met Dirksen at Gr√∂ditzberg, in Silesia. Shortly after his arrival in Tokyo, Dirksen became involved with the efforts of a shady German businessman, drug dealer, Nazi Party member and friend of Hermann G√∂ring, Ferdinand Heye, to become Special Trade Commissioner in Manchukuo.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970, page 127. Dirksen's backing for Heye's schemes for a monopoly of Manchurian soybeanss and his advocacy of German recognition of Manchukuo brought him into conflict with his superior, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath, who preferred closer relations to China than to Japan.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970, page 128. The question of recognition of Manchukuo was a litmus test for relations with both Japan and China. Against Dirksen's advocacy of recognizing Manchukuo, Neurath countered that Germany did far more trade with China than Manchukuo and so recognising Manchukuo would damage Germany's relations with China.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 128. On 18 December 1933, Dirksen was invited by the Japanese to visit Manchukuo to meet Emperor Puyi, an invitation that Dirksen wanted to take up, but the projected visit to Manchukuo was vetoed by Neurath. Instead, Dirksen sent his economic counselor to Manchukuo to meet Puyi, a meeting that was widely taken to indicate that Germany would soon recognise Manchukuo, which prompted furious protests from China. After Dirksen's lobbying, Heye was appointed by Hitler to be his special trade commissioner in Manchukuo and given the authority to negotiate a trade agreement with Manchukuo, but Hitler in a communiqu√© denied that recognition of Manchukuo was imminent.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 129. Dirksen was informed by Neurath that German policy was not to recognise Manchukuo but to seek whatever trade advantages that might be gained. Despite the setback caused by the Heye affair, Dirksen continued his pro-Japanese line by declaring his sympathy for Japan's plans for the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere in return for which he expected German corporations to be allowed to play a prominent role.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 132. Supporters a pro-Chinese policy in the Ausw√§rtiges Amt often countered Dirksen that Japan tended to exclude all foreign corporations from operating, which led them to doubt Dirksen's claims that Germany would profit from the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970, page 130. As Special Trade Commissioner, Heye told the Japanese that Germany would soon recognise Manchukuo and that he would be the first German ambassador in Hsinking (now Changchun, China).Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 130. Heye wanted monopoly over not only soybeans but also all German business and investments in Manchukuo, which would be through a corporation run by himself and the industrialist Fritz Thyssen, who would charge German firms operating in Manchukuo a 10% fee on all profits that they made in Manchukuo.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 131. In addition, Heye, acting on his own, informed the Japanese that German recognition of Manchukuo would soon happen, a claim that strained German relations with both the Chinese, who were offended at the idea of German recognition for Manchukuo, and the Japanese, who were offended when German recognition did not come. The dispute was finally settled in February 1935 when Heye was finally disavowed by Hitler.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970, page 131. Dirksen, a keen supporter of the \\"National Revolution\\" in Germany, often urged a German-Japanese rapprochement under the grounds that the Japanese plans for a \\"New Order in Asia\\" parallelled Germany's plans for a \\"New Order in Europe\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew, The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 41 In one dispatch to Berlin, Dirksen wrote: \\"It seems to be a psychological imperative and one dictated by reasons of state that these two great powers, who are combating the status quo and promoting the dynamism of living forces, should reach an agreement\\"\\" In 1936, Dirksen joined the Nazi Party and then always wore a party badge.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 481. In 1935, Dirksen wrote up a private manuscript Zwischenbilanz (Intermediate Balance Sheet) recounting his life until then, which the American historian Robert Wistrich wrote showed him up to be \\"an egocentric, ambitious and embittered man\\" who complained that Hitler failed to appreciate sufficiently his loyal service. Dirksen was \\"outspokenly anti-Semitic\\", boosted that he never had any Jewish friends or joined any social clubs that admitted Jews, and said that liked the company of only Aryans. In April 1936, Dirksen finally made it to Changchun and concluded a Manchukuo-German trade agreement, which did not constitute de jure German recognition of Manchukuo, which the Reich continued to proclaim to remain part of China, but it was a de facto recognition of Manchukuo. In May 1936, Dirksen complained that the visit to China of General Walther von Reichenau, a well-known German general on the active list and known as one of Hitler's favorite generals, would offend Japan.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 339. At the same time, Dirksen emerged as one the proponents of signing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan, which caused tensions with the Wehrmacht, which opposed the pact, and Neurath, not the least because plans for the pact had originated with Neurath's enemy, Joachim von Ribbentrop.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933‚Äì36, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 344. In his dispatches to Berlin, Dirksen consistently advocated Germany choosing Japan over China. In one dispatch, Dirksen argued the Kuomintang was too corrupt and disorganised to defeat the Chinese Communists, who would inevitably win the Chinese Civil War.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 480. In a conscious echo of the Wilhelmine fear of the Yellow Peril, Dirksen argued a Communist China would ally itself with the Soviet Union, and both would invade Europe. Happily for the Reich, Dirksen argued that there was a strong power in the form of Japan that had a \\"civilising mission\\" in China, eas willing and able to impose \\"order\\" on the hopeless Chinese and stop communism in Asia, which led him to the conclusion that Germany's Asian ally should be Japan, rather than China. After the Xian Incident of December 1936, which led to the formation of the \\"united front\\" of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang to resist any further Japanese encroachments on China, Dirksen reported to Berlin that Japan would never stand for it and predicted that the Japanese would strike China sometime in 1937. In July 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War began with the Marco Polo Incident. Dirksen reported that his Japanese hosts were extremely unhappy that Germany was the largest supplier of arms to China and that officers of the German military mission were training and, in some cases, leading the troops of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army to battle against the Imperial Japanese Army. In response to Dirksen's suggestion for the German military mission to be recalled from China, War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg proposed sending officers to the military mission in China. In late 1937, Dirksen become involved in attempts to mediate the end of the Sino-Japanese war.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 175. The war had caused a major bureaucratic power struggle within the German government: thw Wehrmacht and the Ausw√§rtiges Amt supported China, but the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, the SS and the Propaganda Ministry supported Japan. Dirksen, a pro-Japanese voice in the pro-Chinese Ausw√§rtiges Amt, feared that his career might become marginalized, as Neurath was annoyed at Dirksen's support for the pro-Japanese Ribbentrop, which led Dirksen to suggest German mediation to end the war before the struggle between the pro-Japanese and pro-Chinese factions destroyed his career. Neurath feared that he might lose out in the power struggle with Ribbentrop and took up the suggestion of mediation as a way out. Hitler was indecisive about which side to back. On 3 November 1937, Japanese Foreign Minister K≈çki Hirota gave Dirksen a set of peace terms, which Dirksen sent to Neurath, who in his turn passed them along to Oskar Trautmann, the German ambassador in China, to be handed over to the Chinese. On 7 December 1937, Dirksen met with Hirota to report that Chiang Kai-shek was willing to make peace with Japan if China did not lose any more territory but was otherwise open to \\"peace talks on the basis of Japanese peace conditions\\".Miwa, Yoshiro Japan's Economic Planning and Mobilization in Wartime, 1930s‚Äì1940s, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015 page 132. That posed a problem as ever since the war had begun in July 1937, Japan never stated any war aims other than to \\"chastise\\" the Chinese in the \\"holy war\\" waged for the sake of the god-emperor of Japan. The Japanese cabinet met to begin discussions of the peace terms that would be sought, but on 13 December 1937, the Japanese Army took the Chinese capital of Nanjing, which caused a euphoric mood in Tokyo.Miwa, Yoshiro Japan's Economic Planning and Mobilization in Wartime, 1930s‚Äì1940s, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015 page 133. Japanese Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe decided, over the objections of the military, to escalate the war by seeking a \\"total victory\\" by making peace terms that he knew that Chiang could never accept.Weinberg, Gerhard Hitler's Foreign Policy 1933‚Äì1939: The Road to World War II, New York: Enigma Books, 2013 page 419. On 21 December 1937, Dirksen was presented with the Japanese peace terms to be presented to the Chinese, which were so extreme that even Dirksen remarked that they seemed to be written only to inspire their rejection by the Chinese.Miwa, Yoshiro Japan's Economic Planning and Mobilization in Wartime, 1930s‚Äì1940s, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015 page 135. Dirksen took a very pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese line on the question of mediation and said that if Germany had to choose Japan over China if necessary.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 177. In a dispatch to the Wilhelmstrasse sent on 16 January 1938, Dirsken advised recalling the German military mission from China, ending arms sales to China, recognizing Manchukuo, prohiniting German investment in Kuomintang China and allowing German corporations to invest only in Japanese-occupied northern China. Noting that Ribbentrop was very pro-Japanese, Weinberg described Dirksen as the \\"one important member of the German diplomatic corps who agreed with Ribbentrop's China policy\\" who did much to ensure the final German recognition of Manchukuo in 1938.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 178.  Ambassador to Britain  In early 1938, as part of the Blomberg-Fritsch affair, which saw Hitler tighten his control of the foreign policy and military, Neurath was removed as foreign minister and replaced by Ribbentrop, the ambassador to Britain.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 47. Besides forcing War Minister Werner von Blomberg to retire and removing the Army Commander Werner von Fritsch, the purge also removed several senior generals and diplomats. Dirksen took advantage of the situation by asking for a new post and was rewarded by being made the German ambassador to Britain and replaced Ribbentrop.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 135. Ribbentrop was endeared by Dirksen's support for his pro-Japanese line against Neurath, and besides, Dirksen had also managed to get along well with Heinrich Georg Stahmer, the chief of the Asian desk of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 508 Moreover, Ribbentrop, wanted to promote General Eugen Ott, the German military attach√© to Japan, as ambassador to force the Japanese to reciprocate, and thereby promote his very good friend, General ≈åshima Hiroshi, the Japanese military attache to Germany, to be Japanese ambassador in Berlin. ≈åshima was unique as being the only diplomat who actually liked Ribbentrop. On 4 February 1938, Hitler removed Neurath and also Count Ulrich von Hassell, who was German ambassador to Italy. For a time, it was widely believed that Dirksen would replace Hassell.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 286. Hitler's original plan was to move Franz von Papen, the German ambassador to Austria, to Spain and for Baron Eberhard von Stohrer, the German ambassador to Spain, to replace Ribbentrop in Britain.Weinberg, Gerhard Germany, Hitler, and World War II: Essays in Modern German and World History, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996 page 87. However, the crisis that led to the Anschluss started before Papen could go to Burgos, the capital of Nationalist Spain, which required him to stay in Vienna. Hitler decided to keep Stohrer, who had proved to be able to get along well with the prickly General Francisco Franco in Burgos. Count Hans Georg von Mackensen was demoted from State Secretary and appointed the German ambassador in Rome to replace Hassell, as he was Neurath's son-in-law, which made him stay on as State Secretary unacceptable to Ribbentrop. The German embassy in Britain was traditionally one of the most prestigious \\"grand embassies\\" operated by the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, and his appointment was a major promotion for Dirksen. Unlike Ribbentrop who was an amateur diplomat who caused an endless number of gaffes during his time as ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Dirksen was a professional diplomat, and his appointment was very much welcomed in London, as the British regarded him as \\"a man of ability\\", unlike his predecessor. In 1938 to 1939, he was German Ambassador to Britain and was appointed on 7 April 1938. Dirksen's relations with his superior, Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, were very poor since he despised Ribbentrop as \\"an unwholesome, half-comical figure\\". Dirksen wrote in his 1950 memoirs Moskau, Tokyo, London, \\"During my term of office in London, Hitler never once took the trouble of following up on British offers of negotiations, even if only as a pretense. He never even answered\\".Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 100. On 24 April 1938, Konrad Henlein, the leader of the Sudeten Heimatfront, which was supported by nearly all of the ethnic Germans in the Czechoslovak Parliament, had announced the Karlsbad Program at a party congress in Karlsbad, Czechoslovakia (now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic). He demanded wide-ranging autonomy for the Sudetenland but also announced that he was still loyal to Czechoslovakia.Robbins, Keith \\"Konrad Heinlein, the Sudeten Question and British Foreign Policy\\" pages 674‚Äì692 from The Historical Journal, Volume XII, Issue 4, 1969 page 692. The German government declared its support for the Karlsbad Programme, which had been secretly drafted in March at a meeting between Hitler and Heinlein. That began the crisis in Central Europe that was to end by the Munich Agreement. The apparent moderation of Germany to demand only autonomy for the Sudetenland masked a sinister purpose to make it appear that Czechoslovakia was intransigent by refusing to grant autonomy for the Sudetenland, thus \\"forcing\\" Germany to invade. Heinlein had promised to Hitler, \\"We must always demand so much that we can never be satisfied\\". On 3 May 1938, Dirksen presented his accreditation to King George VI at Buckingham Palace and formally become the ambassador to Britain.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 482. After arriving in London, Dirksen told Viscount Astor that the speech of the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after the Anschluss had \\"closed the door\\" on further Anglo-German talks for a resolution of European problems.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 381. At his first meeting with Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, the subject was Sudetenland, and Dirksen assured Halifax that his government was \\"very anxious to keep things quiet in Czechoslovakia\\".Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 482. Dirksen reported that Halifax had promised him that London ans Paris would send a joint d√©marche to Prague urging the Czechoslovak President Edvard Bene≈° to make \\"concessions to the utmost limit\\" to the Sudeten Heimatfront, which had demanding autonomy.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York: Viking, 1960 page 360. To show to the British the apparent reasonableness of the Sudeten Heimatfront, Dirksen had Heinlein visit London starting on 12 May 1938 to meet various British politicians. Heinlein denied working for Hitler and talked much about the Czechs were \\"oppressing\\" the ethnic Germans of the Sudetenland by forcing ethnic German children to attend schools in which they were taught in Czech. He insisted that he wanted only autonomy for the Sudetenland, but he admitted that if Prague refused to give in to all of eight demands of the Karlsbad Programme, Germany would definitely invade Czechoslovakia.Robbins, Keith \\"Konrad Heinlein, the Sudeten Question and British Foreign Policy\\" pages 674-692 from The Historical Journal, Volume XII, Issue 4, 1969 page 693. At a luncheon hosted by the National Labour MP Harold Nicolson, Heinlein met with various backbenchers from all parties, where he impressed them with his genial charm and mild-mannered ways.Robbins, Keith \\"Konrad Heinlein, the Sudeten Question and British Foreign Policy\\" pages 674-692 from The Historical Journal, Volume XII, Issue 4, 1969 pages 693-694. However, several of the MPs, like General Edward Spears, a Conservative, expressed some concern about the Karlsbad Programme since it declared that Prague should \\"harmonise\\" its foreign policy with Berlin's and that to be German was to be a National Socialist and so the Sudeten Heimatfront was to be the only legal party in the proposed autonomous Sudeten region.Robbins, Keith \\"Konrad Heinlein, the Sudeten Question and British Foreign Policy\\" pages 674-692 from The Historical Journal, Volume XII, Issue 4, 1969 page 694. Starting with the May Crisis in May 1938, Dirksen received warnings from the Foreign Office that Germany should not attempt to resolve the Sudetenland dispute by war.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 391. During the May crisis, Dirksen reported to Berlin that Britain did not want to go to war with Germany for the sake of Czechoslovakia but that it probably would go to war if Germany actually invaded Czechoslovakia.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 483. Dirsken reported that Halifax had told him that \\"in the event of a European conflict it was impossible to foresee whether Britain would not be drawn into it\\".Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York: Viking, 1960 page 364. Dirksen interpreted Halifax's statement as meaning that Britain probably would go to war if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia but noted that Halifax was unwilling to say so explicitly. At the same time, Dirksen was friendly with Joseph Kennedy Sr., the American ambassador to Britain. Dirksen often reported to Berlin the anti-Semitic remarks from Kennedy. At one point, Dirksen stated that Kennedy had told him, \\"it was not so much the fact that we [i.e., Germany] wanted to get rid of the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamour with which we accomplished this purpose\\". On 8 June 1938, Dirksen was \\"frankly outspoken\\" on Ribbentrop in a meeting with Halifax by telling him that it was not true that Ribbentrop was an Anglophobe, and Dieksen understood that he failed as ambassador to Britain because \\"he had always felt obliged to keep one eye so much on the German end.... Nonetheless, he [Ribbentrop] still wished to establish closer relations between our two countries\\". Schorske wrote that everything that Dirksen had told Halifax about Ribbentrop had been lies, as Ribbentrop had emerged as the loudest anti-British voice in the German government and was convinced that sooner or later, Germany and Britain were destined to go to war again. On the same day, Dirksen wrote to Berlin about the \\"psychotic\\" British people, who were willing to go to war with Germany: \\"the feeling... of being made a fool of in that affair [the Anschluss], grew up again, together with the determination not to allow unchallenged further alterations in the balance of power in Europe.... The attitude of the British people to the possibility of war has changed entirely since 1936. They are ready to fight should their government show them that this is necessary in order to put an end to the subjectively experienced threats and uncertainty\\". Dirksen ended his dispatch by warning that Chamberlain was committed to peace, but the \\"psychotic\\" British people might push him into war: \\"To regard the excitement of the last weeks as mere bluff might turn out to be a fatal error\\".Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 pages 483‚Äì484. At the same time, Dirksen warned that the Chamberlain cabinet would \\"without the slightest doubt\\" go to war if Germany was seen to be threatening the balance of power in Europe, and he wrote that British appeasement was based on \\"the one condition that Germany would endeavor to achieve these ends by peaceful means\\".Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 484. Dirksen ended his dispatch of 8 June with the predication that Chamberlain's cabinet was willing to see the Sudetenland join Germany if it was done after a referendum and \\"not interrupted by forcible measures on the part of Germany\\".Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York: Viking, 1960 page 376. In July 1938, Dirksen told Albert Forster, the Gauleiter of Danzig, who was visiting London, that Britain wanted a peaceful resolution of the Czechoslovak Crisis, but Dirksen believed that Britain would go to war if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 380. On 11 July 1938, Dirksen met with Charles Corbin, the French ambassador to Britain.Hucker, Daniel Public Opinion and the End of Appeasement in Britain and France, London: Routledge, 2016 page 41. Corbin reported to Paris that Dirksen had told him, \\"The British people... increasingly tend to envisage the destruction of an air war as the inevitable result of German aggression against Great Britain\\", which Dirksen saw as a positive development and told Corbin that there as long as the British believed that the Luftwaffe would destroy their cities, there was less chance of British \\"aggression\\" against Germany. Dirksen also advised Corbin that for that reason, France should not count on the British if it decided to honour the 1924 French-Czechoslovak Alliance, which committed France to go to war with any nation that attacked Czechoslovakia. However, Corbin also reported that Dirksen had complained to him that \\"public opinion is currently against Germany\\". Later in July 1938, Dirksen was caught in the internal feuds of the Third Reich. Dirksen welcomed the secret visit to London of Captain Fritz Wiedemann, Hitler's personal adjutant, who were there to represent Hermann G√∂ring, who wanted to arrange a visit to London to seek a peaceful solution to the Sudetenland dispute.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 485. G√∂ring detested Ribbentrop and, as chief of the Four-Year Plan Organisation, felt that on economic grounds, that Germany was not ready for a general war in 1938, which led him to oppose Hitler's plans to invade Czechoslovakia in autumn 1938. G√∂ring attempted to undercut foreign policy of Hitler and Ribbentrop by sending Wiedemann to London, a policy manoeuvre that was ruined when Dirksen told Ribbentrop that Wiedemann was in London. That enraged Ribentrop, who insisted quite vehemently that foreign policy was the sole preserve of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt and led to Wiedemann's recall. In early August 1938, Dirksen returned to Berlin to tell Hitler personally of his belief that Britain would go to war if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, bur the F√ºhrer was not interested in the message.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 389. Hitler generally ignored Dirksen in August and September 1938, but Dirksen was in contact with several other Nazis such as Rudolf Hess and Fritz Bohle and expressed his concerns that Hitler might trigger a general war by going ahead with his plans to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October 1938.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 487. In September 1938, at the Nuremberg party congress, Dirksen met Hitler and told him of his fears of a general war and of his belief that the British were prepared to pressure the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany as the price for peace.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 487. Hitler was not interested in a peaceful resolution of the Sudetenland dispute or in Dirksen's views. During the congress, Hitler, in his keynote speech on 12 September 1938, laid claim to the Sudetenland and announced if it was not allowed to return to Germany by 1 October, he would invade Czechoslovakia, which escalated the crisis and took Europe to the brink of war. In the September 1938 crisis that led to the Munich Agreement, Dirksen played only a small role, but as a diplomat with an elegant bearing and aristocratic manners whose fluent English and polite ways charmed many in Britain, Dirksen was the respectable face of Germany in Britain in 1938. As a professional diplomat and an aristocrat, Dirksen enjoyed a good rapport with the British elite. His insistence that Hitler was wanted only to correct the \\"injustices\\" of Versailles, not to dominate Europe, impressed many of the British policymakers he met. Unlike Ribbentrop, whose arrogance and ignorance led him to commit many social gaffes, the eminently-\\"correct\\" Dirksen, with his perfect gentleman's manners, made a favourable impression in London. Immediately after the Munich Agreement and the Anglo-German Declaration, both signed on 30 September 1938, Dirksen was told by Ribbentrop that the declaration, which committed the two nations never to go to war again, meant nothing to Hitler. However, knowing that Chamberlain attached great importance to the declaration, Dirksen was told to act as if it did. At the Chiemsee during the Bergsgarden Summit, 15 September 1938. In the foreground from to right are Dirksen, Neville Chamberlain and Ribbentrop. In October 1938, in a dispatch to Berlin, Dirksen reported that the British public reaction to Hitler's Saarbr√ºcken speech on 3 October 1938, stating that Germany would not tolerate British \\"interference\\" in the affairs of Europe, had been highly negative.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 493. Dirksen also advised Hitler to stop attacking by name two Conservative backbenchers in the House of Commons, Anthony Eden and Winston Churchill, since his speeches raised their profile in the British press.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 493. Finally, Dirksen reported that based on his meetings with members of the British cabinet that, he believed that the Chamberlain government was seeking an Anglo-German d√©tente. Dirksen advised that Germany take up the British offer of \\"disarmament\\", which, in the 1930s. He predicted that to lead to Chamberlain offering to return to Germany its former African colonies that were now ruled by Britain. In response, Baron Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the State Secretary of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, wrote back to Dirksen that the German media campaign hostile to British rearmament \\"was instigated on the direct orders of the Foreign Minister\\". Schorske noted that a \\"striking\\" aspect of the line of Anglo-German negotiations that Dirksen wanted to pursue in October 1938 was that reflected Chamberlain's priorities, such as disarmament and the possible return of the former German colonies in Africa, did not reflect Hitler's priorities, such as Czecho-Slovakia (the new name of Czechoslovakia since October 1938), the Memelland and Poland. In the last two weekends of October 1938, Dirksen made visits to the English countryside to meet Sir Samuel Hoare and Leslie Burgin for talks on an Anglo- German d√©tente.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 86‚Äì87. Dirksen reported to the Wilhelmstrasse that both Hoare and Burgin wanted talks about an Anglo-German treaty to end the arms race; another treaty to \\"humanise\\" air war with bombing of cities and chemical weapons to be banned; a colonial settlement to return the former German colonies in Africa in exchanges for promises of no war in Europe and a British \\"guarantee\\" to protect Germany from the Soviet Union.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 87. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote: \\"This last is often cited by Soviet historians as proof of their thesis that the Cabinet was obsessed with the urge to provoke a German-Soviet war. Taken in its proper context, Hoare's ill-chosen remarks made it clear that the offer of a guarantee was intended to disarm any German arguments that Soviet strength in the air necessitated the maintenance of a large German Luftwaffe\\". Three weeks after the Munich Agreement, which Dirksen had predicted would allow an Anglo- German d√©tente, Weizs√§cker wrote to Dirksen, \\"Things here are moving rapidly, but not in the direction of Anglo-German rapprochement at present\\". In November 1938, Dirsken complained about the Kristallnacht solely under the grounds that it damaged Germany's image in Britain but made no moral condemnation of the pogrom at all. In early December 1938, Dirksen formally announced that his government planned to use the clauses in the Anglo-Naval Agreement to build a submarine fleet equal to Britain's and would upgrade two cruisers under construction from the 6-inch guns, which they were meant to have, to having instead 8-inch guns.Watt, D.C How War War, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 92. In December 1938, Dirksen resumed his efforts for Anglo-German d√©tente in the hope of negotiating a series of Anglo-German economic agreements as the starting point.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 494. In December 1938, Chamberlain gave a speech at a formal dinner of the correspondents of the German News Agency in London, with Dirksen present.Maiolo, Joseph The Royal Navy and Nazi Germany, Macmillan Press: London, 1998 page 169 When Chamberlain spoke of the \\"futility of ambition, if ambition leads to the desire for domination\\", Dirksen, who interpreted that remark as an implied criticism of Hitler, led all of the assembled German journalists to walk out in protest. In January 1939, Dirksen opened up talks with the Foreign Office for an Anglo-German coal agreement. Hitler had authorised Anglo-German economic talks in January 1939 as a smokescreen for the anti-British turn in his foreign policy. He approved the five-year Plan Z on 27 January 1939 for a gigantic fleet that was meant to crush the Royal Navy by 1944. The Z Plan called for six H-class battleships with 20-inch guns that would have been the largest battleships ever built if they had actually been constructed by dwarfing even Japan's Yamato class battleships, which were actually the largest battleships ever built, with their 18-inch guns. Building such truly colossal battleships took time and money and so required a period of Anglo-German peace. A notable contradiction existed in Hitler's strategic planning in 1939 between embarking on an anti-British foreign policy, whose major instruments were a vastly-expanded Kriegsmarine and a Luftwaffe capable of a strategic bombing offensive, which would take several years to build, and engaging in reckless short-term actions, such as attacking Poland, which were likely to cause a general war.Roberston, E.M. \\"Hitler Planning for War and the Response of the Great Powers\\" from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch Macmillan Press: London, United Kingdom, 1985 page 212.Messerschmidt, Manfred \\"Foreign Policy and Preparation for War\\" from Germany and the Second World War Clarendon Press: Oxford, United Kingdom, 1990 pages 688‚Äì690. Ribbentrop, because of his status as the expert on Britain, resolved Hitler's dilemma by supporting the anti-British line and by repeatedly advising Hitler that Britain would not go to war for Poland in 1939.Bloch, Michael Ribbentrop, New York: Crown Publishing, 1992 page 228 In February 1939, Dirksen invited Sir Oliver Stanley, the president of the Board of Trade, to visit Germany for economic talks in Berlin, which was taken as a sign in London that Germany wanted better relations. Dirksen also tried to have Economics Minister Walther Funk visit London for economics talks, but it was vetoed by Ribbentrop as a threat to his turf. Dirksen told British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax not to take the anti-British campaign personally in the German media that had been launched in November 1938 and said that it was only a negotiating tactic, not a preparation for war. Dirksen went on to say that Ribbentrop was not really an Anglophobe bur was willing to come to London personally to sign an Anglo- German nonaggression pact. In early March 1939, Dirksen visited Berlin, where Ribbentrop told him that Germany would violate the Munich Agreement later that month by occupying the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia and that Prague would be German by the middle of the month.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 494. After his return to London on 9 March 1939, Dirksen recalled in his memoirs that he \\"found the same optimistic mood that had prevailed in February. Stanely's visit to Berlin was to take place soon ‚Äì on March 17 ‚Äì and it was obvious that the British government attached great importance to it\\".Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 495. Shortly afterward, Dirksen welcomed to London Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the Frauenfuhrerin who ran the party's women's branch and had come to Britain to study \\"social conditions\\" affecting British women.Gottlieb, Julie ‚ÄòGuilty Women‚Äô, Foreign Policy, and Appeasement in Inter-War Britain, London: Macmillan, 2016 page 61. Scholtz-Klink was a fanatical Nazi who was praised by Hitler as \\"the ideal National Socialist woman\\". The dinner to welcome Scholtz- Klink at the Claridge's by the Anglo-German Association attended by an impressive collection of British high-society women, including Lady Violet Astor; the Dowager Marchioness of Reading; the Conservative MP Florence Horsbrugh; the Dowager Countess of Airlie, Lady Cynthia Colville; and the presidents of the National Women's Citizens Association, the National Council of Women of Great Britain, and the National Council for Maternity and Child Welfare. Dirksen reported that the dinner had gone well and the British women had been very interested in what Scholtz-Klink had to say, but the fact that she spoke no English and needed an interpreter imposed problems. However, Scholtz-Klink's visit to London sparked protests by British feminists outside the German embassy with women carrying signs written in German reading, \\"Freedom for the women of Hitler's concentration camps\\".Gottlieb, Julie ‚ÄòGuilty Women,‚Äô Foreign Policy, and Appeasement in Inter-War Britain, London: Macmillan, 2016 page 62. On 15 and 16 March 1939, during meetings with Halifax after the German occupation of the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia, Dirksen received warnings that Britain would go to war to resist any Germany attempt to dominate the world and that Britain might attempt a policy of \\"containment\\" after the violation of the Munich Agreement.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 540. Dirksen's meetings with Halifax were described as very \\"stormy\\", as Halifax chided him for how his government had just violated the Munich Agreement.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 495. Dirksen responded that the Treaty of Versailles was \\"unjust\\" to the Reich, Czechoslovakia had been created by Versailles and destruction of Czecho-Slovakia had been justified as Germany was just undoing the \\"unjust\\" terms of Versailles. Halifax, not impressed with that argument, told Dirksen that his government had promised in the Munich Agreement to respect the sovereignty of Czecho-Slovakia and that for him, keeping a promise was the mark of men of honour. Halifax, an aristocrat from Yorkshire, had felt a certain affinity for Dirksen, an aristocrat from Silesia and so found dishonesty from Dirksen to be especially reprehensible and told Dirksen that gentleman do not lie to each other. In his reports to Berlin, Dirksen toned down Halifax's language and remarks, especially the parts in which Halifax criticised Dirksen for not behaving like a gentleman and an aristocrat by lying to him. However, the British transcripts showed that Halifax was far more angry than what Dirksen's reports would suggest.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 167. On 17 March 1939, Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham to the Birmingham Unionist Association and said that if Germany wanted to dominate the world, Britain would go to war, rather than accept a world dominated by the Reich.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York: Viking, 1960 page 454. In his speech, Chamberlain wondered aloud if, by occupying Prague, Germany had taken \\"a step in the direction to dominate the world by force\\". He went on to say if Germany wanted to \\"challenge\\" Britain for world domination that \\"no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing, this nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it ever were made\\". In a long report on the Birmingham speech that he sent to Berlin on 18 March 1939, Dirksen wrote, \\"It would be wrong to cherish any illusions that a fundamental change has not taken place in Britain's attitude to Germany\\". Dirksen took a contradictory line in the spring and summer of 1939 between his desire to see a war that would wipe Poland off the map and his fear of starting a world war that Germany might lose. Dirksen was extremely anti-Polish and had often called for the destruction of Poland and so supported Fall Weiss (Plan White), the German plan to invade Poland.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 620. Schorske wrote that Dirksen \\"believed firmly in the justice of Hitler's anti-Polish policy. Like most German nationalists, he held the Poles in complete contempt, a contempt fortified in his case by service in Warsaw and Danzig during his younger years\\".Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 500. When Britain offered the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland on 31 March 1939, Dirksen protested to Halifax: \\"Britain, by her guarantee to Poland, placed the peace of the world in the hands of minor Polish officials and military men\\". Dirksen's policy in the Danzig Crisis was one to attempting to allow Germany to attack Poland without fear of British involvement. Dirksen wanted a war against Poland in 1939 but not a war against Britain and repeated his efforts to sever Britain from Poland by trying to persuade Britain to give up its \\"guarantee\\" of Poland. In his meetings with Halifax in the spring and the summer of 1939, Dirksen often told him about \\"Polish adventurism and moral turpitude\\" and attacked the British quite violently for being so \\"foolish\\" as to make a \\"guarantee\\" of a people who, Dirksen insisted, did not at all deserve British protection.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 500. Dirksen reported to Weizs√§cker that he wanted \\"to enlighten the English, who are unsophisticated in continental and especially East European affairs, on the nature of the Polish state, and on our claims to Danzig and the Corridor\\". On the British efforts to create a \\"peace front\\" to \\"contain\\" Germany, Dirksen told Halifax that all Germans were \\"unanimously determined to parry this danger of encirclement and not to tolerate a repetition of 1914\\". Despite Dirksen's attempts to argue that the Free City of Danzig, which was 90% German, should be allowed to return to the Reich, the German occupation of the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia on 15 March 1939 meant the British were not receptive to his appeals in 1939, unlike in 1938 over the Sudetenland. As Halifax put it on 20 July 1939: From 14 April to 16 August 1939, the German embassy in Britain received on a weekly basis anonymously mailed packages containing decrypted diplomatic cables to and from the Foreign Office to the British embassy in the Soviet Union. They were carefully edited to make it appear that Anglo-Soviet relations were far better than what there were and that the talks to have the Soviet Union join the \\"peace front\\" were going well.Andrew, Christopher & Gordievsky, Oleg The KGB: The Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev, New York: Harper Collins, 1990 page 197 Dirksen was not entirely certain of the origin of packages or the precise veracity of their contents, but he passed them on along back to Berlin and said that intelligence might be useful. Two cipher clerks in the Foreign Office, John King and Ernest Oldham, had independently sold in the early 1930s the Foreign Office's codes to the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, and so the Soviets read all of the Foreign Office's cables throughout the 1930s.Andrew, Christopher & Gordievsky, Oleg The KGB: The Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev, New York: Harper Collins, 1990 142‚Äì144 & 179‚Äì180. The mysterious packages were from the NKVD, which wanted to make it appear that an Anglo-Soviet alliance was in the offering as a way of frightening Germany to come to terms with Moscow. On 18 May 1939, during a meeting with Halifax, Dirksen was informed that the Reich should have no illusions about Britain's willingness to go to war, and that if Germany should attack Poland, Britain would go to war.Carley, Michael Jabara 1939: The Alliance That Never Was and the Coming of World War II, Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield 1999 page 163. In response, an angry Dirsken told Halifax that Germany's policy had always been seeking peacefully to revise the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had no intention of invading Poland and Halifax had fallen victim to anti-German hysteria in believing otherwise. Dirksen often reported to Berlin the British efforts to built a \\"peace front\\" to be blocked by the question of including the Soviet Union. On 27 May 1939, Chamberlain told the House of Commons that the cabinet had instructed Sir William Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, to open discussions on a military alliance.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York: Viking, 1960 page 490. Dirken reported to the Wilhelmstrasse that Chamberlain had opened the talks with the Soviets \\"with the greatest reluctance\\" and that he was not keen on an alliance with the Soviet Union. Dirksen reported that the British had learned about the \\"German feelers in Moscow\\" and were \\"afraid that Germany might succeed in keeping Soviet Russia neutral or even inducing her to adopt benevolent neutrality. That would have meant the complete collapse of the encirclement action\\". On 24 June 1939, Dirksen, in a dispatch, to Berlin reported that his efforts to turn the British against the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland were bearing fruit, and he stated that he believed the British government to be moving away from the \\"encirclement\\" of Germany towards a \\"more constructive policy\\".Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 506. Dirksen reported on the same day that British public opinion had been caught up in anti-German \\"hysteria\\" in the spring but that he now believed that public opinion was in a \\"state of flux\\" since the full implications of war with Germany had started to be felt.Hucker, Daniel Public Opinion and the End of Appeasement in Britain and France, London: Routledge, 2016 page 176. As evidence, Dirksen quoted to Weizs√§cker from several letters to the editor of The Times attacking the Poles for refusing to allow Danzig to return to Germany and criticizing Chamberlain for the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland, which Dirksen thought was proof that British public opinion was changing. Dirksen also wrote that \\"a surprise initiative on the part of Chamberlain is within the bounds of probability and it is quite possible that rumor current here, that he will approach Germany with new proposals after the completion of the negotiations with the Russians will materialize into fact in one form or another\\". In Dirksen's view, the proposed alliance with the Soviet Union that would form the eastern anchor of the \\"peace front\\" was merely a negotiating tactic for a Munich-type deal to resolve the Danzig Crisis, rather than to deter Germany from invading Poland. In early July 1939, Dirksen reported to the Wilhelmstrasse that British public opinion would come to understand the \\"justice\\" of the German demand for the Free City of Danzig to be allowed to return to Germany.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 501. Dirksen wrote: \\"The wave of excitement will ebb as soon as it rose, as soon as the proper conditions exist. The most important condition is a quieter atmosphere in England which will permit a more unprejudiced examination of the German viewpoint. The germs of this already exist. Within the Cabinet and a small, but influential group of politicians, a desire is manifested to pass from the negativity of the encirclement front to a more constructive policy towards Germany. And however strong the counter-forces trying to stifle this tender plant may be-Chamberlain's personality is a certain guarantee that a British policy will not be placed in the hands of unscrupulous adventurers (i.e Churchill, Eden, etc)\\". On the British efforts to build a \\"peace front\\", Dirksen explained it to Berlin as a result of a \\"dual policy\\" by the Chamberlain government.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 501. Dirksen reported: \\"England wants by means of armament and the acquisition of allies to make herself strong and equal to the Axis, but at the same time she wants by means of negotiation to seek an adjustment with Germany and is prepared to make sacrifices for it: on the question of colonies, raw materials supplies, Lebensraum, and spheres of economic influence\\". In private, Dirksen complained that Ribbentrop's relentless Anglophobia unnecessarily inflamed Anglo-German relations by making Ribbentrop persist in presenting to Hitler every move in British foreign policy in the worse possible light. Dirksen told the Foreign Office in an \\"off-the-record\\" meeting that a high-level Englishman who was fluent in German, the only language that Hitler spoke, should visit Berlin to meet Hitler to tell him that an Anglo-German rapprochement was still possible.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 pages 501‚Äì502. On 17 July 1939, Helmuth Wohlthat, Hermann G√∂ring's deputy in the Four-Year Plan Organisation, attended the meeting of the International Whaling Conference in London as part of the German delegation, and the next day, he and Dirksen met Sir Horace Wilson, the Chief Industrial Adviser to the Government and one of Chamberlain's closest friends.Watt, D.C How War War, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 399. Wilson decided to talk to Wohlthat of the Four-Year Plan Organisation, rather than the Ausw√§rtiges Amt since the latter was run by the Anglophobic Ribbentrop. Without informing Ribbentrop, Dirksen allowed the Wilson-Wohlthat meetings in London to go ahead in which Wilson offered that in an exchange for a German promise not to attack Poland and a \\"renunciation of aggression in principle\\" as a way of solving international disputes, he would agree to an Anglo-German nonaggression pact, a \\"delimitation of spheres of influence\\" in Europe and a plan for the \\"international governance\\" of Africa in which all of the European great powers would jointly administer Africa.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477‚Äì511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 506. However, Wilson clarified to Wohlthat that he regarded Germany as the source of the tension between Germany and Poland by laying claim to Danzig and that the onus was on the Reich to reduce tension with Poland, not the other way around. Halifax told Dirksen much the same thing at the same time.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 398. Dirksen and Wohlthat argued that Wilson and another British civil servant, Robert Hudson, had given them a memorandum, \\"Programme for German-British Cooperation\\", but Wilson denied having given them such a document, and Wilson's account of the meeting to the Foreign Office suggested that neither Wohlthat nor Dirksen seemed very serious, as both expected all of the concessions to come from Britain, with Germany making none.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 399‚Äì400. On 20 July 1939, Hudson, of the Department of Overseas Trade, visited the German embassy to meet Dirksen and Wohlthat.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 400. Hudson, an ambitious civil servant and former Conservative MP who was addicted to intrigue, acted on his own in the hope of scoring a great success to help his otherwise-stalled career. In a somewhat-vainglorious account of his meeting at the German embassy, Hudson spoke of about having Danzig rejoin Germany if the latter promised to leave Poland alone. According to Hudson's notes, in exchange for a German promise not to invade Poland and for ending the Anglo-German arms race, a plan would have the industrialists who ran the heavy industry of Germany, Britain and the United States work together in the economic development of China, Eastern Europe and Africa; a loan in sum of hundreds of millions for Germany to be floated in the City and on Wall Street and some sort of plan for the \\"international governance\\" of Africa. He ended his account by saying that if only Hitler learned to think in economic terms, much would be possible. A preening Hudson, who believed that he had more-or-less singlehandedly saved the world from the threat of another world war by his visit to the German embassy, unwisely showed his notes recording what he had said to a group of journalists and told them \\"off the record\\" thar he had just ended the crisis by his bold proposals for Anglo- German economic co-operation and that Wohlthat was definitely interested in what Hudson had to say.Watt, D.C How War Come, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 400. Hudson asked the journalists not to publish yet since his plan needed more time, but two of the journalists decided that the story was news and so decided to publish. On 22 July 1939, The Daily Telegraph and The News Chronicle broke the story on their front pages that Britain just had offered Germany a loan worth hundreds of millions of pound sterling in exchange for not attacking Poland. The public reaction to the story was highly negative, with much of the press calling Hudson's proposed loan \\"Danegeld\\". To stop Viking raids and attacks, English kings had sometimes paid \\"Danegeld\\", meaning Dane money, to bribe the Danes from attacking, and ever since, \\"paying the Danegeld\\" in England has implied weakness and cowardice that of those who would rather bribe their way out of trouble to standing up for themselves. By calling Hudson's proposed loan to Germany \\"Danegeld\\", the British newspapers effectively called Hudson a coward. Much to Hudson's humiliation, Chamberlain told the British House of Commons that no such loan was being considered and that Hudson was speaking for himself.Watt, D.C How War Come, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 401. Based on his meetings with Wilson, Dirksen advised on 24 July 1939 to take up Wilson's offer to discuss how best to have Danzig peacefully return to Germany and said that unless the Reich made a move soon, \\"Churchill and the other incendiaries\\" in the backbenches were to be stopped wouls topple Chamberlain's government. Dirksen approved of the Wilson-Wohltat meetings, as he felt it was possible to reach an Anglo-German deal with G√∂ring, who was much more pragmatic than Ribbentrop.Watt, D.C How War War, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 396. Dirksen found his room to maneuver had been greatly reduced by the Hudson affair hitting the press and that it was difficult to contact Wohlthat after he returned to Germany, on 21 July 1939.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 402. It was not until late August that Dirksen finally saw the report that Wohlthat had given to G√∂ring on his return to Berlin in late July.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 399-402. Dirksen had supported the Wilson-Wohlthat meetings but had managed to hide his role enough to make it appear as only a minor player to protect himself from Ribbentrop, who he knew he would disapprove of them.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 402. On 31 July 1939, Ribbentrop's message to Dirksen attacked him severely for allowing the Wilson-Wohlthat talks even to take place, said that the British had no business in talking to one of G√∂ring's men and demanded any negotiations conducted by the British to pass by him.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 507. Dirksen managed to save himself from worse trouble only by presenting Wilson as the one who had initiated the talks, which he portrayed to Ribbentrop to be a sign of British weakness.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 585. Ribbentrop had no interest in any sort of talks to resolve the German-Polish dispute, as he wanted a war in 1939, the Danzig dispute being a mere pretext. Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, the German ambassador to Poland, had been ordered by Ribbentrop not to conduct talks with the Poles, as it always Ribbentrop's great fear in 1939 that the Poles might actually allow the Free City of Danzig to return to Germany, and for the same reason, Ribbentrop always refused to see J√≥zef Lipski, the Polish ambassador to Germany.Weinberg Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany : Starting World War II 1937‚Äì39, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 pages 561‚Äì562 & 583‚Äì584. Only nine hours after Ribbentrop had attacked Dirksen for allowing the Wilson-Wohlthat talks to occur and ordered Dirksen to sabotage the talks, Weizs√§cker sent Dirksen a cable asking if the British were prepared to sever their commitments to Poland and how serious the British were about having the Soviet Union join the \\"peace front\\".Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1953 page 508 Dirksen, in response, sent Weizs√§cker a cable stating \\"leading personages\\" in London were willing to abandon Poland if Germany promised not to take Danzig by force, and the entire strategy of the \\"peace front\\" would be disregarded if Germany was willing to take up the offers made by Wilson to Wohlthat. As for the Soviet Union joining the \\"peace front\\", Dirksen reported: > \\"The continuation of negotiations for a pact with Russia, in spite of ‚Äì or > rather, just because of ‚Äì the dispatch of a military mission is regarded > here with skepticism. This is borne out by the composition of the British > military mission: the admiral, until now the Commandant of Portsmouth, is > practically in retirement, and was never on the staff of the Admiralty; the > general is likewise purely a combat officer; the air general is an > outstanding aviator and air instructor, but not a strategist. This indicates > the value of the military mission is more to ascertain the fighting value of > the Soviet Army rather than to make operational arrangements.... The > Wehrmacht attach√©s are agreed in observing a surprising skepticism in > British military circles about the forthcoming talks with the Soviet armed > forces\\".Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York: > Viking, 1960 page 503. Dirksen also noted the British military mission to the Soviet Union, which was headed by Admiral Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, was taking a ship, the City of Exeter, which not noted for its speed, which Dirksen used to argue that the British were not really serious about having the Soviet Union join the \\"peace front\\". Dirksen believed thar the report would win Hitler to a plan that would \\"chemically dissolve the Danzig problem\\" and not seek war, but instead, Ribbentrop used Dirksen's report to argue to Hitler that the British were cowards who were unwilling to go war for Poland, as was proven by Dirksen's statement that the British were not really interested in having the Soviet Union join the \\"peace front\\". On 3 August 1939, Dirksen had his final meeting with Wilson.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 page 403. The accounts left by Dirksen and Wilson of the meeting are so different that they are impossible to reconcile. Wilson's account has him insisting that Germany had to take the initiative to end the Danzig crisis and with Wilson pressing Dirksen on why Hitler was not acting on thw back channel that he opened to try to end the crisis. Dirksen, by contrast, portrayed Wilson as being desperate for any sort of concession and reproduced Wilson's warnings of war as an expression of British fear of German might.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 402‚Äì403. The Canadian historian Michael Jabara Carley summarised the differences between the German and British accounts of the Wilson-Dirksen meeting: \\"According to Wilson, Dirksen proposed an agenda of items that would interest Hitler, according to Dirksen, Wilson confirmed what he had suggested to Wohlthat, including a non-aggression pact and trade negotiations\\".Carley, Michael Jabara 1939: The Alliance That Never Was and the Coming of World War II, Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield 1999 page 194. Most notably, Dirksen has Wilson saying that the proposed Anglo-German non-aggression pact would end the \\"guarantee\\" to Poland and the negotiations with the Soviet Union, with the clear implication that Germany would have all of Eastern Europe, in exchange for leaving the British Empire alone.Shore, Zachery What Hitler Knew: The Battle for Information in Nazi Foreign Policy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 pages 94-95. Dirksen also has Wilson saying that the negotiations must be kept secret, as any leak would anger the British people and might even bring down the Chamberlain government, and that Wilson wanted the Anglo-German talks to be held in secret in Switzerland, a statement that does not appear in Wilson's notes of the meeting.Carley, Michael Jabara 1939: The Alliance That Never Was and the Coming of World War II, Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield 1999 pages 194-195.Shore, Zachery What Hitler Knew: The Battle for Information in Nazi Foreign Policy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 95 Historians have greatly differed over the version of the Wilson-Dirksen meeting that is correct. The American historian Zachery Shore argued that Dirksen had no reason to fabricate such an offer from Wilson, and Chamberlain, was in fact, seeking to begin secret negotiations for an Anglo-German non-aggression pact in Switzerland that would have seen Britain abandon Poland.Shore, Zachery What Hitler Knew: The Battle for Information in Nazi Foreign Policy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 pages 123-124 By contrast, the British historian D.C. Watt has argued for the veracity of Wilson's notes by arguing that there is no evidence on the British seeking such a pact, which, if signed, would have probably brought down the Chamberlain government. At times, Dirksen reported in his dispatches to Ribbentrop that British public opinion was tired of appeasement and that Britain would go to war if Germany attacked Poland. However, Dirksen noted that the British \\"guarantee\\" of Poland issued on 31 March 1939 was only of the independence of Poland, not of its borders, and he believed, based on contacts with British politicians, that another Munich- style deal was possible for the Free City of Danzig to return to Germany. At other times, Dirksen reported to Berlin that Britain would not honour the Anglo-Polish military alliance, and would back down if Germany invaded Poland. In August 1939, Dirksen reported that Chamberlain knew \\"the social structure of Britain, even the conception of the British Empire, would not survive the chaos of even a victorious war\\" and so he would abandon his commitments to Poland.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew, The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 56 Dirksen's messages on Britain's unwillingness to go to war to defend Poland had the effect of convincing Hitler that any German attack on Poland would result only in a German‚ÄìPolish War, not a world war.Overy, Richard \\"Germany, 'Domestic Crisis' and War in 1939\\" pages 97-128 from The Third Reich The Essential Readings edited by Christian Leitz, London: Routledge, 1999 page 121 To prevent any British offer that might stop the war, Ribbentrop ordered for none of his ambassadors in London, Paris and Warsaw to be at their posts.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 430. On 14 August 1939, Dirksen arrived in Berlin to take a vacation in Germany and was told by Weizs√§cker that he was under no condition to return to London.Watt, D.C How War Came, London: Parthenon, 1989 pages 431. At the same time, Weizs√§cker also informed Count Johannes von Welczeck, the German ambassador to France, and Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, the German ambassador to Poland, who had also been ordered to take a vacation in Germany, that neither men were to return to their posts. Dirksen, in turn, mentioned that to Baron Bernardo Attolico, the Italian ambassador to Germany, to say it was going to be war for certain in the summer and observed that if his country wanted a peaceful resolution of the Danzig Crisis, the ambassadors to Britain, France and Poland would have been ordered to return to their embassies. Attolico reported that to Rome, and as the Germans had broken the Italian diplomatic codes, Dirksen was summoned to the Wilhelmstrasse by Ribbentrop to be screamed at and berated for his incompetence and to be told that he was now excluded from all political discussions as a security risk. When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, thar was followed by a British declaration of war on Germany on 3 September, an effect of which was the ruin of Dirksen's diplomatic career, and he never held a major post again.  World War II  Gr√∂ditzberg Dirksen spent most of the war at Gr√∂ditzberg and his estate in Silesia at Gr√∂ditz (now Grodziec, Poland). As a leading expert on the subject, Dirksen often gave talks on the Soviet Union at various locales throughout Europe, such as to Wehrmacht generals, most notably Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, who visited Gr√∂ditzberg to ask Dirksen for advice. As many of the farm labourers who worked Dirksen's estate were called up for service with the Wehrmacht, Dirksen used slave labour from Poland as replacement workers to tend to the sugar beet fields on his estate. In 1943, Dirksen published a picture book, Freundesland im Osten ein Nipponbuch in Bildern, containing a collection of photographs of daily Japanese life that he had taken during his time as ambassador in Japan. In February 1945, Gr√∂ditzberg was taken by the Red Army. Dirksen chose to stay in the belief that he could serve as a mediator between the Soviet Union and Germany. The Red Army plundered the castle but became more respectful when Dirksen showed them a photograph taken in the early 1930s of himself and the Defense Commissar, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov. Voroshilov was unique under Stalin as being the only member of the Soviet Politburo allowed to have a personality cult of his own. Ribbentrop believed that Dirksen would betray secrets to the Soviets and ordered him to be taken back. An Abwehr team was infiltrated into Gr√∂ditzberg and arrived at the castle to tell Dirksen that he was coming, regardless of what he might think. On a cold February night, Dirksen and the Abwehr team walked through the frozen fields back to the German lines. Dirksen left behind his private papers at the castle, which were captured by the Red Army.Epstein, Fritz \\"Review of Moscow, Tokyo, London pages 621‚Äì622 from The American Historical Review, Volume 58, Issue 3, April 1953 page 622. In 1948, the Narkomindel published a very-selective version of Dirksen's papers dealing with his time as ambassador in London to support the official Soviet historical line that British appeasement had been aimed at causing a German-Soviet war to save British capitalism, thus justifying the 1939 German-Soviet Pact to thwart the alleged British scheme. Later life In 1947, Dirksen was cleared by a denazification court, which declared him not have been an active party member. In 1950, Dirksen published his memoirs, Moskau, Tokyo, London, recounting his career as a diplomat in the Soviet Union, Japan and the United Kingdom. He stated quite flatly that he was not ashamed that he had joined the Nazi Party in 1936, as the regime had achieved \\"impressive\\" political and economic changes in Germany.Schorske, Carl \\"Two German Ambassadors: Dirksen and Schulenburg\\" pages 477-511 from The Diplomats 1919‚Äì1939 edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1953 page 481 In a review of the book, the American historian Fritz Epstein noted that there were significant differences between the book's German original, published in 1950, and the English version, published in 1952. One is that the section dealing with Dirksen's time as a diplomat in the Netherlands in 1917 had been reduced from three pages to six lines. Also, his time as a diplomat in Kiev dealing with the puppet regime of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi had six pages in the German original but three pages in the English edition.\\"Review of Moscow, Tokyo, London pages 621‚Äì622 from The American Historical Review, Volume 58, Issue 3, April 1953 page 621. In another review, the Canadian scholar Frank Tresnak asked about the differences between Germany's traditional elite and the Nazi elite. He answered, \\"If were we are to judge by this book, there seems to have been precious little\\".Tresnak, Frank Review of Moscow, Tokyo, London pages 229‚Äì231 from International Journal, Volume 7, No. 3, Summer 1952 page 230. Tresnak continued, \\"From 1919 onward, the common aim of almost all Germans was to achieve the abolition of the Versailles diktat‚Äìa treaty which just or unjust, was an adequate expression of the German defeat of 1918, after a war which Germany herself started\\". Tresnak wrote that Dirksen's memoirs showed that he, in all essentials, fully agreed with Hitler's plans to destroy the international order that had been established by the Treaty of Versailles and to have Germany become the world's strongest power. They differed only on the precise strategy and tactics to be employed. Tresnak ended his review by remarking, \\"He has tears aplenty for torn and defeated Germany, but not a word of sympathy for the millions of murdered Jews, Poles, Yugoslavs, Czechs, and the rest.... After reading Herr von Dirksen's book, one cannot help feeling that he, and perhaps other Germans as well, condemn Hitler chiefly on the grounds that he did not win the war‚Äìthough sometimes they act as they are not aware that he lost it\\". In a review, the American political scientist Joseph Schectman noted that Dirksen expressed much anger in his memoirs about the expulsions of Germans from Eastern Europe but failed once to mention that Germany had killed about 1,500,000 Poles and 6,000,000 Jews during the war. Schectman noted Dirksen's seemed to say that only the lives of Germans matter, not the lives of Poles and Jews.Schechtman, Joseph Review of Moscow, London, Tokyo pages 662-664 from The Western Political Quarterly Volume 5, No. 4, December 1952 page 664. Baron Tilo von Wilmowsky, the husband of Barbara von Krupp and a senior executive at the firm of Krupp AG, which was Germany's biggest corporation, had become involved in a campaign to \\"clear the rubble\\" cast against German big business.Wiesen, Jonathan West German Industry and the Challenge of the Nazi Past, 1945-1955 Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003 page 218. Wilmowsky's preferred instrument was Henry Regnery, a conservative Germanophile American publisher based in Chicago that specialised in publishing books that sought to deny that Germany's traditional elites were anyway involved with National Socialist crimes and portrayed Allied policies towards Germany both during and after World War II as cruel and unjust.Wiesen, Jonathan West German Industry and the Challenge of the Nazi Past, 1945-1955 Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003 page 217. It published such conservative classics like God and Man at Yale by William F. Buckley and The Conservative Mind by Russell Kirk and it also published strongly-antiwar books such as Politics, Trials and Errors by Royal Marine General Maurice Hankey. They vigorously denounced the war crimes trials and argued for the innocence of all German and Japanese leaders convicted of war crimes. Also, it published Victor's Justice, by Montgomery Belgion, which condemned the Allied policies of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice as cruel and barbaric, and The High Cost of Vengeance, by Freda Utley, which argued that the Allied policies towards Germany had been criminal and inhumane. In 1950, Wilmoswky used Dirksen, Heinrich Br√ºning, Franz von Papen and Belgion as his major advisers on the latest book that Regnery was going to publish, which was intended to deny that industrialists like him had supported the Nazi regime and used slave labour during World War II.Wiesen, Jonathan West German Industry and the Challenge of the Nazi Past, 1945-1955 Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003 pages 217-218 The industrialist Baron Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, who had effectively ran Krupp AG during World War II, had been convicted by an American court of using slave labour, and Wilmowsky wanted to rebut that charge. In a letter, Dirksen advised Wilmowsky that it would \\"psychologically better\\" if the book was presented as a \\"neutral investigation of industrialists in the total state and total war\\" that compared both industrial mobilisation in the Allies and the Axis, rather than focusing on the actions of German industrialists.Wiesen, Jonathan West German Industry and the Challenge of the Nazi Past, 1945-1955 Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003 page 218 Dirksen argued that if the mobiliaation of industrialists by the state wartime were to be presented as a universal trend, the specific acts by German industrialists, like using slave labour, could be explained away as part of a universal tendency. Dirksen felt such a book would be useful in ending the \\"Nuremberg complex\\" held against Germany and argued that it was time that people stop holding Nazi crimes against Germany. Belgion wrote to Dirksen: \\"My own feeling is that such a book... would not appeal to the general public unless it could be cast in the form of a dramatic story and that would require on the part of the author a rare combination of gifts‚Äìan understanding of the problems of large-scale business and also an ability to give the exposition of them a magic touch. I do not myself know of any English or American author who possesses that combination\\". After much searching for an author, Wilmowsky's book was finally published by Regnery in 1954 as Tycoons and the Tyrant: German industry from Hitler to Adenauer by Louis P. Lochner, which portrayed German industrialists as victims of Hitler and argued it was not their fault that they ended up using slave labour in their factories. Dirksen was active in the 1950s in groups that represented Germans expelled from Silesia and rejected the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line as Germany's eastern frontier. In 1954, Dirksen called a press conference to criticize Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's policy of western integration. He instead argued that West Germany should try to play off the Western powers against the Soviet Union to achieve German reunification.

It is local government area is the City of Hume. At the 2016 Census, Kalkallo had a population of 105. Located on the Hume Freeway, Kalkallo has a few streets, a service station and a pub. It is surrounded by farms not yet developed by the urban sprawl of Melbourne. The nearest access to public transport is the Donnybrook railway station which is serviced by regional V/Line trains. History The Kalkallo area is located on the traditional lands of the people of the Woiwurrung. It is believed that the clan which occupied land including the South Morang area was the Wurundjeri William. Colonisation occurred in Victoria from 1835, and land sales commenced in the Parish of Kalkallo in 1840. An example of an early rural town settlement, Kalkallo contains many natural and cultural heritage sites of significance including churches, hotels, monuments, bridges, waterways and grasslands. In 1848 residents began requesting a post office for the township, and Kinlochewe Post Office opened on 1 November 1850. The post office was located in the Robert Burns Inn on Summerhill Road and Sydney Road. In 1854 it was moved and renamed Donnybrook, then renamed Kalkallo in 1874, before eventually closing in 1971. During the gold rush years the town boomed as travellers made their way up Sydney Road and the township featured seventeen accommodation houses, a police station, jail and court house. In the 1870s the duplication of the Hume Highway and the opening of the north-east railway decimated the population. Environment Kalkallo is located amongst the large Gilgai plain. Located near Donovans Lane north-west of the town centre, is Bald Hill volcano that last erupted over 1 million years ago. Merri Creek runs through Kalkallo to the east of the township. The Kalkallo Grasslands are remnants of a large area of grassland which houses many threatened species of plants, amphibians and reptiles: = Flora= *Gilgai Brown Grass *Small Pepper Cress *Dianella amoena *Prasophyllum frenchii *Pussy tails *Narrow-leaf new holland daisy *Chaffy bush-pea *Smooth rice flower *Plains Yam Daisy =Fauna= *Growling Grass Frog *Red-chested buttonquail *Plains froglet *Common spade foot toad *Cunningham's spiny-tailed skink *Bougainvilles skink *Lowland copperhead *Australian Smelt *Water Rat *Engaeus Quadrimanus *Eastern three-lined skink *Tussock skink *Little whip snake *Southern lined earless dragon *Striped legless lizard Planning Kalkallo has been a focus of a number of town planning ideas since colonisation, but remains largely undeveloped in 2015, however there are a number of housing developments current being planned and built. =Garden City= As part of the publication We Must Go On: A Study of Planned Reconstruction and Housing Frederick Oswald Barnett along with W.O. Burt and Frank Heath focused on improvement of housing in Australia and Melbourne after World War II. Barnett and Burt played a significant role in the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board and the garden city movement was a central focus proposed to solve the slum problems in Melbourne. Frank Heath was an architect who produced town plans based on garden city principles, and plans for Kalkallo as a garden city are printed in We Must Go On. The book does not detail the motives for these plans, however they were never implemented, and as a result Kalkallo remains a small township. =Urban Growth Boundary= Melbourne's Urban Growth Boundary was extended to include Kalkallo in 2010. It was designated as part of the Urban Growth Zone in 2012. Urban sprawl is a divisive topic in Melbourne as it is claimed to ease housing affordability, but can have significant impacts on the environment, as well as social impacts such as isolation due to a lack of transport infrastructure. The Victorian State Government has expanded the Urban Growth Boundary several times since 2002 as a result of the Melbourne 2030 plan (later known as Melbourne@5million). Melbourne 2030 introduced the notion of creating a limit on urban expansion. However, since the implementation of Melbourne 2030, the boundary has been extended, which is contradictory to a key objective. Plan Melbourne, established in May 2014 highlighted the need for the Metropolitan Planning Authority to establish a permanent urban boundary to replace the urban growth boundary, and restrict further expansion. Today Kalkallo is a small town servicing the highway trade and surrounding agricultural district. Current community infrastructure includes: *Kalkallo Common (a 9.8 ha crown land grassland reserve managed by Hume City Council) *Kalkallo Cemetery *Kalkallo CFA *John Laffan Memorial Reserve (an 8ha reserve containing two ovals) =New housing developments= As a result of the urban growth boundary expansion, there have been a number of new housing developments established: *Merrifield Merrifield is an 880 hectare $8 Billion mixed-use development located on the corner of Donnybrook Road and the Hume Highway. Merrifield has been planned as an integrated mixed use development with capacity to provide 20,000 new jobs and homes for up to 30,000 people. *Cloverton Located around the Ball Hill area, plans include a large metropolitan activity centre and a future train station north of Donnybrook. Clovertown will eventually house 30,000 residents. *Kallo A smaller development north of Donnybrook Road that will border Merri Creek, close to the existing Donnybrook train station. Master plans outline 730 homes with 2000 residents with facilities such as a community centre, primary school, open space, nature reserve and town centre. *The Woods - Mickleham See also * City of Whittlesea - the local government area of which Kalkallo was a part.

Gibbs, (March 25, 1870 - November 7, 1943) was a Newfoundland lawyer and politician, who served as the second mayor of St. John's. Born St. John's, Newfoundland, the son of John Gibbs and Marguerite Murray, he was educated at the Christian Brothers School in St. John's, and articled in law with the Hon. M.H. Carty. Gibbs was called to the bar in 1896, and created King's Counsel in 1911. In 1898, he married Barbara Mary Eadie. Gibbs established a Tenant's League in 1892 in an attempt to have land courts established, and became in 1893 editor of the Terra Nova Advocate. He was elected as a Conservative in St. George's district in 1897, in his second attempt at a seat in the House of Assembly. He was defeated in four subsequent general elections, however, contesting a variety of districts. While a member for St. George's (1887‚Äì1900) Gibbs established a reputation as an advocate of trade unionism and as a skilled negotiator on behalf of labour. He was instrumental in launching the Longshoremen's Protective Union (LSPU) in 1903 and remained LSPU counsel until his death. Gibbs also helped St. John's bakers and carpenters to organize, and he became Mayor of St. John's in 1906 as a Labour candidate. When Edward Patrick Morris resigned from the Bond Administration Gibbs was offered Morris's cabinet post as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, but declined and joined Morris in forming the Newfoundland People's Party. After defeats in the ensuing general elections of 1908 and 1909 Gibbs was appointed to the Legislative Council and made Minister without portfolio in the Morris Administration, refusing further cabinet posts after Morris's resignation in 1918. Gibbs was appointed President of the Legislative Council in 1930, maintaining that position until 1934 when the council was disbanded. He died in St. John's at the age of 73.

This accomplishment, coming days after her grandfather died, was overshadowed by the fact that this was the last Olympic race in the career of swimming legend Janet Evans. =1998 World Aquatics Championships= A new rival emerged for Bennett in the 800-meter freestyle, teammate Diane Munz who had beaten her in two separate races the past couple years. However, Bennett led from the start and held off Munz's late finishing charge to win the 800-meter freestyle gold. She also led the 400-meter freestyle most of the way, but was passed at the end by a swimmer of the controversial Chinese women's team, finishing with silver. =2000 Summer Olympics= '''' At the 2000 Summer Olympics Brooke hit the peak of her swimming career. She won two more gold medals in the 400- and 800-meter freestyle races, with the latter coming in Olympic record time. In the 400-meter freestyle she defeated a strong field that included her teammate Diana Munz who had beaten her at the U.S. Olympic trials, the 1996 Olympic 200 freestyle champion Claudia Poll, and that year's fastest performer, Hannah Stockbauer. Bennett's time was the fastest in the event in nine years. In the 800-meter freestyle Bennett again faced formidable competition from 200- and 400-meter medley Olympic winner Yana Klochkova, and Kaitlin Sandeno who had pulled a major upset in denying Diana Munz a place in the 800-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic trials. Bennett led from the start, swam an aggressive and steady race, and won commandingly in the fastest 800-meter freestyle time in 10 years. =Post 2000 Olympics= Her attempt for a third straight Olympic appearance fell short in 2004, following operations on both of her shoulders in 2001. She finished third in the 800-meter freestyle (with only the top two finishers qualify for the Olympic Team).

It is the southernmost settlement in Germany and one of its highest towns. At the center of Oberstdorf is a church whose tall spire serves as a landmark for navigating around town. The summits of the Nebelhorn and Fellhorn provide dramatic panoramic views of the alps. The Nebelhorn can be reached with a big cable car. Visitors can ride a unique diagonal elevator to the top of the Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze.  Geography  View of Oberstdorf The Nebelhorn, Oberstdorf's local mountain = Administrative divisions = Oberstdorf consists of the village of Oberstdorf (813 metres above sea level, survey point by the Roman Catholic church) and five other villages: * Kornau , 915 m. In the vicinity is the S√∂llereckbahn and the Chapel of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian which is rich in art treasures. * In Reichenbach (population: 226) is the 450-year-old Chapel of St. James and the Moorwasser swimming pool. * The little hamlet of Rubi has 175 inhabitants. * Typical of Sch√∂llang are the farm houses around the Baroque onion tower of the parish church. In the vicinity is the 1531 castle church. * The village of Tiefenbach takes its name from trees called Bergkiefer. The village lies on a terrace above the Breitach stream. Tiefenbach has a centuries-old spa tradition thanks to its sulphur spring. As early as the late 15th century counts and other high-ranking people convalesced here to cure their illnesses. = Valleys = View of Oberstdorf from the Gai√üalphorn There is a large number of valleys in the area around Oberstdorf, many of which are not only scenic, but are often starting points for walks in the mountains. The following list shows the main valleys together with their side valleys: * Breitach ** Starzlach * Stillach (Stillachtal or Birgsautal) ** Rappenalpbach (Rappenalptal) ** Warmatsgundbach (Warmatsgundtal) * Iller * Oybach (Oytal) * Trettach ** Dietersbach ** Traufbach Oytal and Dietersbachtal are separated by the H√∂fats and Rauheck. Gerstruben, Germany's highest village, lies at the entrance to the Dietersbachtal. The Rappenalptal is the longest and runs from Germany's southernmost village, Ein√∂dsbach, past the Haldenwanger Eck, Germany's southernmost point. At the end of the valley the Schrofen Pass leads to Austria. = Mountains = The Allg√§u Alps in the area around Oberstdorf attain heights of over 2,600 metres and belong to the Northern Limestone Alps.

When the Romans had abandoned the area east of the Upper Rhine and north of the Upper Rhine in the 3rd century, various Germanic groups migrated into the area, which were later called Alemanni.Landnahme der Alemannen (oberstdorf-lexikon.de) Oberstdorf was first mentioned in 1141. King Maximilian, the later emperor, granted Oberstdorf in 1495 the right to hold a market and the High Court.Oberstdorf erh√§lt das Marktrecht (1495) (oberstdorf-lexikon.de) In 1518 Count Hugo of Montfort built a spa in Tiefenbach at the sulphur spring, which is regarded as a precursor of today's spa facility.Unser altes Bad: Tiefenbach (oberstdorf- lexikon.de) During World War II the mountains around the village were used to train mountain troops of the Wehrmacht. At the end of the war French and Mexican troops were stationed there. Sports In December, before every New Year, Oberstdorf hosts the first part of the ski jumping Four Hills Tournament on the Schattenberg large hill. There is also a ski flying hill, Heini- Klopfer-Skiflugschanze, about seven kilometres to the south. ABC's Wide World of Sports famously featured the Oberstdorf ski flying hill when Vinko Bogataj fell during his jump in 1970, thus becoming known as \\"The Agony of Defeat\\". Oberstdorf hosted the Nordic skiing World Championships in 1987 and 2005 and won the bid for the 2021 World Championships. The town has also hosted several stages of the Tour de Ski, a cross-country skiing stage event. Germany's modern figure skating center was built on the outside of the town. It has three covered rinks and some of them are accessible to the public, for recreational skating. It is a popular destination with European skaters for training camps. Oberstdorf hosts the annual Nebelhorn Trophy figure skating competition and has hosted the German Figure Skating Championships twelve times. It has also hosted the 1982, 2000, and 2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. One of the two ISU adult figure skating competitions (for skaters aged 28 and older) is held in Oberstdorf each May.

It is named for the British chemist William Randall Bamford and the Scottish chemist Thomas Stevens Stevens (1900‚Äì2000). The usage of aprotic solvents gives predominantly Z-alkenes, while protic solvent gives a mixture of E- and Z-alkenes. As an alkene-generating transformation, the Bamford‚ÄìStevens reaction has broad utility in synthetic methodology and complex molecule synthesis. The Bamford- Stevens reaction The treatment of tosylhydrazones with alkyl lithium reagents is called the Shapiro reaction. Reaction mechanism The first step of the Bamford‚ÄìStevens reaction is the formation of the diazo compound 3. (also in the Collective Volume (1990) 7:438 (PDF)) The mechanism of the Bamford-Stevens reaction In protic solvents, the diazo compound 3 decomposes to the carbenium ion 5. The mechanism of the Bamford-Stevens reaction In aprotic solvents, the diazo compound 3 decomposes to the carbene 7. The mechanism of the Bamford- Stevens reaction Directed Bamford-Stevens reaction The Bamford‚ÄìStevens reaction has not proved useful for the stereoselective generation of alkenes via thermal decomposition of metallated tosylhydrazones due to the indiscriminate 1,2-rearrangement of the carbene center, which gives a mixture of products. By replacing an alkyl group with a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group on N-aziridinylimines, migration of a specific hydrogen atom can be enhanced. With the silicon atom beta to H, a œÉC-Si ‚Üí œÉ*C-H stereoelectronic effect weakens the C-H bond, resulting in its exclusive migration and leading to the nearly exclusive formation of allylsilanes instead of equal amounts of allylsilanes and isomeric homoallylsilanes, analogous to the mixture of products seen in the dialkyl case, or other insertion products (i.e. cyclopropanes). See beta-silicon effect. center Synthesis of 3-substituted indazoles from arynes and N-tosylhydrazones N-tosylhydrazones can be used in a variety of synthetic procedures. Their use with arynes has been used to prepare 3-substituted indazoles via two proposed pathways. The first step is the deprotonation of the hydrazone of diazo compounds using CsF. At this point, the conjugate base could either decompose to give the diazo compound and undergo a [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition with the aryne to give the product, or a [3+2] annulation with aryne which would also give the final product. While strong bases, such as LiOtBu and Cs2CO3 are often used in this chemistry, CsF was used to facilitate the in situ generation of arynes from o-(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates. CsF was also thought to be sufficiently basic to deprotonate the N-tosylhydrazone.center N-tosylhydrazones as reagents for cross-coupling reactions Barluenga and coworkers developed the first example of using N-tosylhydrazones as nucleophilic partners in cross- coupling reactions. Typically, nucleophilic reagents in coupling reactions tend to be of the organometallic variety, namely organomagnesium, -zinc, -tin, -silicon, and ‚Äìboron. Combined with electrophilic aryl halides, N-tosylhydrazones can be used to prepare polysubstituted olefins under Pd- catalyzed conditions without the use of often expensive, and synthetically demanding organometallic reagents. The scope of the reaction is wide; N-tosylhydrazones derived from aldehydes and ketones are well tolerated, which leads to both di- and trisubstituted olefins. Moreover, and variety of aryl halides are well tolerated as coupling partners including those bearing both electron-withdrawing and electron- donating groups, as well as œÄ-rich and œÄ-deficient aromatic heterocyclic compounds. Stereochemistry is an important element to consider when preparing polysubstituted olefins. Using hydrazones derived from linear aldehydes resulted in exclusively trans olefins, while the stereochemical outcomes of trisubstituted olefins were dependent on the size of the substituents. center The mechanism of this transformation is thought to proceed in a manner similar to the synthesis of alkenes through the Bamford‚ÄìStevens reaction; the decomposition of N-tosylhydrazones in the presence of base to generate diazocompounds which then release nitrogen gas, yielding a carbene, which then can be quenched with an electrophile. In this case, the coupling reaction starts with the oxidative addition of the aryl halide to Pd0 catalyst to give the aryl PdII complex. The reaction of the diazocompound, generated from the hydrazone, with the PdII complex produces a Pd-carbene complex. A migratory insertion of the aryl group gives an alkyl Pd complex, which undergoes syn beta-hydride elimination to generate the trans aryl olefin and regenerate the Pd0 catalyst. This reaction has also seen utility in preparing conjugated enynes from N-tosylhydrazones and terminal alkynes under similar Pd-catalyzed reaction conditions and following the same mechanism. center Moreover, Barluenga and coworkers demonstrated a one-pot three- component coupling reaction of aldehydes or ketones, tosylhydrazides, and aryl halides in which the N-tosylhydrazone is formed in situ. This process produces stereoselective olefins in similar yields compared to the process in which preformed N-tosylhydrazones are used. Barluenga and coworkers also developed metal-free reductive coupling methodology of N-tosylhydrazones with boronic acids. The reaction tolerates a variety of functional groups on both substrates, including aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents, and proceeds with high yields in the presence of potassium carbonate. The reaction is thought to proceed through the formation of a diazo compound that is generated from a hydrazone salt. The diazo compound could then react with the boronic acid to produce the benzylboronic acid through a boronate intermediate. An alternate pathway consists of the formation of the benzylboronic acid via a zwitterionic intermediate, followed by protodeboronation of the benzylboronic acid under basic conditions, which results in the final reductive product. center This methodology has also been extended to heteroatom nucleophiles to produce ethers and thioethers. A tandem rhodium-catalyzed Bamford-Stevens/thermal aliphatic Claisen rearrangement A novel process was developed by Stoltz in which the Bamford‚ÄìStevens reaction was combined with the Claisen rearrangement to produce a variety of olefin products. This transformation proceeds first by the thermal decomposition of N-aziridinylhydrazones to form the diazo compound (1), followed by a rhodium-mediated de-diazotization (2) and the syn 1,2-hydride shift (3). This substrate undergoes a thermal aliphatic Claisen rearrangement (4) to yield the product. center Application to total synthesis Trost et al. utilized the Bamford‚ÄìStevens reaction in their total synthesis of (‚Äì)-isoclavukerin to introduce a diene moiety found in the natural product. A bicyclic trisylhydrazone was initially subjected to Shapiro reaction conditions (alkyllithiums or LDA), which only led to uncharacterizable decomposition products. When this bicyclic trisylhydrazone was subjected to strong base (KH) and heat, however, the desired diene product was generated. Moreover, it was shown that olefin generation and the following decarboxylation could be performed in one pot. To that end, excess NaI was added, along with an elevation in temperature to facilitate the Krapcho decarboxylation. center References See also * Shapiro reaction Category:Olefination reactions Category:Elimination reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Bamford‚ÄìStevens reaction"},{"id":"1918373","text":"Relief, formerly known as Panorama, is a public affairs newsmagazine series in Canada, airing nightly in Ontario on TFO, the Franco-Ontarian public television network.

Despite the fact that the word labyrinth is synonymous with maze, this game is very different in the manner of game play and dealing from the game Maze, and should not be confused with it. Labyrinth Solitaire does however have similar gameplay to the solitaire game Babette, and the spatial puzzle in which cards become available is also reminiscent of Crazy Quilt. Rules The player first takes the four Aces out of the deck and lay them down as the foundations. Then eight cards are laid in a row below these four cards. The cards on this row can be built on the foundations up by suit up to Kings. Any gap is immediately filled by a card from the stock. Once no more moves can be made, a new row of eight cards is formed. However, once any card leaves the second row to the foundations, it is not filled; filling gaps by new cards only applies to the first row. Only cards on the top and bottom rows are available and when a card on the bottom row is removed, the card above it is released and can be played. The same goes for a card which is below a card from the top row when that card is removed, when the player decides to fill the gap later or when the stock runs out. As new rows are formed, chances are that there are gaps in the in-between rows except the top. These \\"holes\\" give the impression of a labyrinth, hence the name. The dealing of new rows, putting cards to the foundations, and filling any gaps on the first row continues until the stock runs out. When the player gets stuck after this point, he can draw any card from the other rows as a last resort. The game is won when all cards are built into the foundations.
