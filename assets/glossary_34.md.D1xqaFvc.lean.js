The railroad has since expanded to include more than of track, reaching as far as Midville, Georgia. Initially only the portion from Rochelle to Preston, Georgia was utilized, with the Preston-Mahrt and Rochelle-Vidalia lines out of service. The Heart of Georgia also hosts the SAM passenger excursion train and is owned by parent company Atlantic Western Transportation Company. Primary commodities include feed products, chemicals, plastic pellets, aggregates, lumber, grain, pulpwood, scrap metal, and fertilizer, amounting to around 7,500 annual carloads. History An east-west route from Vidalia to Mahrt forms the core of the Heart of Georgia railroad and was built in segments over a period of several years. The Americus, Preston & Lumpkin was started in 1884 and connected its namesake cities by 1887. Also in 1887 further extension brought the terminus of the railroad further east to Abbeville. In 1888 the railroad became the Savannah, Americus & Montgomery. The railroad continued to grow in 1890, reaching Lyons in the east, as well as the Chattahoochee River, and eventually Montgomery to the west. At Lyons, the SA&M; met the newly constructed Savannah & Western. In 1895, the SA&M; was reorganized under the Georgia & Alabama and in 1900 the railroad once again changed hands into the Seaboard Air Line. Through a number of mergers the line eventually came under the ownership of the Seaboard System in 1983, which abandoned the line between Montgomery and Mahrt on April 20, 1986. The remaining line from Mahrt to Rhine, Georgia was sold to the Georgia Southwestern by CSX Transportation on June 5, 1989. Georgia Southwestern ended operations on the line from Preston to Mahrt in 1999, and the state of Georgia sought a new operator for the entire route from Vidalia to Mahrt, part of which was still retained by the Georgia Southwestern. The Heart of Georgia railroad was created in 1999 for the purpose of operating the line on behalf of the state. On May 22, 2000 the state purchased the remaining portion of the line not already under their ownership between Omaha, Georgia and the end of the line across the river in Mahrt as well as an additional between Rochelle and Preston retained by the Georgia Southwestern. On February 19, 2004 the Heart of Georgia expanded its line with the annexation of the Ogeechee Railway between Vidalia and Midville, a distance of . However, the portion between Midville and a point south of Swainsboro is now operated by the Georgia Southern Railway. In 2010 ground was broken on an inland port on the Heart of Georgia in Cordele, Georgia. The port is expected to generate significant traffic for the HOG and provide traffic for the restored Rhine-Vidalia route. On February 7, 2017, national shortline operator Genesee & Wyoming announced that it had purchased the Heart of Georgia, with the deal expected to be finalized later in the year after regulatory approval. SAM Shortline Railway In addition to freight services provided by the Heart of Georgia, the railroad also hosts the SAM Shortline Railroad heritage train of about 45 miles between Archery, Georgia and Cordele. The train is managed by the Southwest Georgia Railroad Excursion Authority with the HOG providing the locomotives and operating crews. Cordele Intermodal Services In December, 2010 The Heart of Georgia began hosting intermodal transport for Cordele Intermodal Services out of the Cordele Inland Port. Cordele Intermodal Services facilitates container transport between the Georgia Ports Authority in Savannah and the Cordele Rail Ramp. Heart of Georgia Railroad operates the line between Cordele, GA and Vidalia, GA. Georgia Central Railroad operates the rail line between Vidalia and Savannah. Heart of Georgia Railroad has seen significant traffic increases in traffic since Cordele Intermodal Services' inception.

He is portrayed by Paul Campbell. Billy appeared until late in the second season, at which point he was killed by terrorists. Paul Campbell has said that his character was killed because he had been unwilling to commit to a five-year contract. In the miniseries, Keikeya was assigned to Secretary of Education Laura Roslin as an aide during the decommissioning of the Battlestar Galactica. As he and Roslin were en route back to Caprica, the Cylon attack occurred, forcing Roslin to assume the presidency. Keikeya lost most of his family on Picon during the attack. After the Galactica and the remnants of society fled the Cylon attack, Keikeya continued to work with the President, rarely leaving her side. Billy was among the first to deduce that Roslin was dying of cancer. Both he and Roslin developed a strong loyalty to each other; Roslin once commented that Billy was like a son to her, and the closest thing to family she had. According to Commander Adama, Roslin said she saw similarities between Keikeya and the late President Richard Adar and believed that Keikeya would be President one day. Billy used to be in a debate team back on Caprica. During the military coup that put Roslin in prison, Keikeya worked with several of Galactica's crewmembers to break her out. However, Keikeya refused to escape with Roslin after the breakout, fearing her break with the military could cause serious fractures within the fleet. Keikeya later traveled with Adama to locate Roslin on the surface of Kobol and reunite the fleet. Keikeya was also one of the few people to enter the Tomb of Athena and see the map to Earth (Home, Part II). During much of his time after the Cylon attack, Keikeya was in a romantic relationship with Petty Officer Anastasia \\"Dee\\" Dualla. He eventually proposed to her; however, she said that she could never marry him. Keikeya later discovered Dualla and Lee Adama in a romantic setting on Cloud Nine. The establishment was seized by terrorists. During the incident, Keikeya tried to convince one of the terrorists, Vinson, that what he was doing was wrong. When Vinson revealed he was doing it because he lost his brother in a Cylon attack, Billy related that he'd lost his own family in the destruction of the Colonies. Throughout the incident, Billy eyed a terrorist's gun, but Dee told him not to try as he wasn't military. When the ruse Admiral Adama used to try to defuse the situation is discovered, the terrorist leader orders Dee's death. Billy grabs a gun from a terrorist and shoots Dee's would-be killer, Vinson, but Billy is shot and killed in return. Roslin later cries over his body in the morgue (having earlier told Adama that Billy was the only family she had left) and is seen to keep a picture of him on her desk. He was soon replaced by Tory Foster as Roslin's aide.

The patient's real name was Ida Bauer (1882‚Äì1945); her brother Otto Bauer was a leading member of the Austro-Marxist movement. Freud published a case study about Dora, Fragments of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria (1905 [1901], Standard Edition Vol. 7, pp. 1‚Äì122; ). Case history=Family background Dora lived with her parents, who had a loveless marriage, but one which took place in close concert with another couple, Herr and Frau K. The crisis that led her father to bring Dora to Freud was her accusation that Herr K had made a sexual advance to her, at which she slapped his face‚Äîan accusation which Herr K denied and which her own father disbelieved.Gay, p. 247‚Äì8 Freud himself reserved initial judgement on the matter, and was swiftly told by Dora that her father had a relationship with Frau K, and that she felt he was surreptitiously palming her off on Herr K in return.Gay, pp. 248‚Äì90 By initially accepting her reading of events, Freud was able to remove her cough symptom; but by pressing her to accept her own implication in the complex interfamily drama, and an attraction to Herr K, he alienated his patient, who abruptly finished the treatment after 11 weeks, producing, Freud reported bitterly, a therapeutic failure.Gay, pp. 251‚Äì2 Dreams Freud initially thought of calling the case 'Dreams and Hysteria', and it was as a contribution to dream analysis, a pendent to his Interpretation of Dreams, that Freud saw the rationale for publishing the fragmentary analysis.Gay, p. 247 Ida (Dora) recounted two dreams to Freud. In the first: > [a] house was on fire. My father was standing beside my bed and woke me up. > I dressed quickly. Mother wanted to stop and save her jewel-case; but Father > said: 'I refuse to let myself and my two children be burnt for the sake of > your jewel-case.' We hurried downstairs, and as soon as I was outside I woke > up.Sigmund Freud, Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria, Standard > Edition, Vol. VII, p. 64. The second dream is substantially longer: > I was walking about in a town which I did not know. I saw streets and > squares which were strange to me. Then I came into a house where I lived, > went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. She wrote > saying that as I had left home without my parents' knowledge she had not > wished to write to me to say Father was ill. \\"Now he is dead, and if you > like you can come.\\" I then went to the station and asked about a hundred > times: \\"Where is the station?\\" I always got the answer: \\"Five minutes.\\" I > then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man > whom I met. He said to me: \\"Two and a half hours more.\\" He offered to > accompany me. But I refused and went alone. I saw the station in front of me > and could not reach it. At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of > anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at > home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about > that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The > maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others > were already at the cemetery.Sigmund Freud, Fragment of an Analysis of a > Case of Hysteria, Standard Edition, Vol. VII, p. 94. Freud reads both dreams as referring to Ida Bauer's sexual life‚Äîthe jewel case that was in danger being a symbol of the virginity which her father was failing to protect from Herr K.Gay, p. 251 He interpreted the railway station in the second dream as a comparable symbol.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (1988) p. 96 His insistence that Ida had responded to Herr K's advances to her with desire‚Äî\\"you are afraid of Herr K; you are even more afraid of yourself, of the temptation to yield to him\\",Quoted in Gay, p. 251 increasingly alienated her. According to Ida, and believed by Freud, Herr K himself had repeatedly propositioned Ida, as early as when she was 14 years old. Ultimately, Freud sees Ida as repressing a desire for her father, a desire for Herr K, and a desire for Frau K as well. When she abruptly broke off her therapy‚Äîsymbolically just on 1.1.1901, only 1 and 9 as Berggasse 19, Freud's addressKatharina Adler Ida, Hard cover, 508 Pages, published July 24th 2018 by Rowholt ‚Äîto Freud's disappointment, Freud saw this as his failure as an analyst, predicated on his having ignored the transference.Malcolm, p. 93-4 One year later (April 1902), Ida returned to see Freud for the last time, and explained that her symptoms had mostly cleared up; that she had confronted the Ks, who confessed that she had been right all along; but that she had recently developed pains in her face.Gay, p. 252 Freud added the details of this to his report, but still viewed his work as an overall failure; and (much later) added a footnote blaming himself for not stressing Ida's attachment to Frau K, rather than to Herr K, her husband.Jacques Lacan, √âcrits: A Selection (1997) p. 92 Freud's interpretation Through the analysis, Freud interprets Ida's hysteria as a manifestation of her jealousy toward the relationship between Frau K and her father, combined with the mixed feelings of Herr K's sexual approach to her. Although Freud was disappointed with the initial results of the case, he considered it important, as it raised his awareness of the phenomenon of transference, on which he blamed his seeming failures in the case. Freud gave her the name 'Dora', and he describes in detail in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life what his unconscious motivations for choosing such a name might have been. His sister's nursemaid had to give up her real name, Rosa, when she accepted the job because Freud's sister was also named Rosa‚Äîshe took the name 'Dora' instead. Thus, when Freud needed a name for someone who could not keep her real name (this time, in order to preserve his patient's anonymity), Dora was the name that occurred to him.Sigmund Freud, The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, Standard Edition, Vol. VI, pp. 240-41. Critical responses=Early polarisation Freud's case study was condemned in its first review as a form of mental masturbation, an immoral misuse of his medical position.Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1961) p. 383 A British physician, Ernest Jones, was led by the study to become a psychoanalyst, gaining \\"a deep impression of there being a man in Vienna who actually listened to every word his patients said to him...a true psychologist\\".Quoted in Gay, p. 184 Carl Jung also took up the study enthusiastically.Gay, p. 199 Middle years By mid-century, Freud's study had gained general psychoanalytic acceptance. Otto Fenichel, for example, citing her cough as evidence of identification with Frau K and her mutism as a reaction to the loss of Herr K.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) pp. 221-4. Jacques Lacan singled out for technical praise Freud's stressing of Dora's implication in \\"the great disorder of her father's world ... she was in fact the mainspring of it\\".Lacan, p. 236. Erik Erikson, however, took issue with Freud's claim that Dora must necessarily have responded positively at some level to Herr K's advances: \\"I wonder how many of us can follow without protest today Freud's assertion that a healthy young girl would, under such circumstances, have considered Herr K's advances 'neither tactless nor offensive'.\\"Quoted in Gay, p. 686. Feminist and later criticisms Second-wave feminism would develop Erikson's point, as part of a wider critique of Freud and psychoanalysis. Freud's comment that \\"This was surely just the situation to call up distinct feelings of sexual excitement in a girl of fourteen\\", in reference to Dora being kissed by a \\"young man of prepossessing appearance\\",Sigmund Freud, Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria, Standard Edition, Vol. VII, p. 28. was seen as revealing a crass insensitivity to the realities of adolescent female sexuality. Toril Moi was speaking for many when she accused Freud of phallocentrism, and his study of being a 'Representation of Patriarchy';Gay, p. 761 while H√©l√®ne Cixous would see Dora as a symbol of \\"silent revolt against male power over women's bodies and women's language...a resistant heroine\\".Quoted in L. Appiganesi/J. Forrester, Freud's Women (2004) p. 46 (Catherine Cl√©ment however would argue that as a mute hysteric, in flight from therapy, Dora was surely far less of a feminist role model than the independent career woman Anna O.).S. L. Gilman, Hysteria Beyond Freud (1993) p. 332-3 Even those sympathetic to Freud took issue with his inquisitorial approach, Janet Malcolm describing him as \\"more like a police inspector interrogating a suspect than like a doctor helping a patient\\".Malcolm, p. 73 Peter Gay too would question Freud's \\"insistent tone...The rage to cure was upon him\\";Gay, pp. 251 and p. 255 and conclude that not only the transference but also his own countertransference needed more attention from Freud, at this early stage of development of psychoanalytic technique.Gay, pp. 253‚Äì4 Literature *Lidia Yuknavitc, 2012.

They claimed Kshatriya status themselves. Rana dynasty is historically known for the iron-fisted rule. This changed after the Revolution of 1951 with the promulgation of a new constitution, when power shifted back to the monarchy of King Tribhuvan. The Rana dynasty descended from the Kunwar family, a nobility of the Gorkha Kingdom. Due to the marital lineages with the politically reigning Thapa dynasty (of Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa) from early 19th century, Ranas gained entry to central Darbar politics. Ranas were also linked to the minor faction of another politically acclaimed Pande dynasty of Gorkha through Thapa dynasty.  Genealogy  Chronicler Daniel Wright has published the genealogy of Jang Bahadur Kunwar Rana. The genealogy begins with TattƒÅ RƒÅ·πáƒÅ as Raja (King) of Chittaurgarh. His nephew Fakht Si·πÉha RƒÅ·πáƒÅ had a son named RƒÅma Si·πÉha RƒÅ·πáƒÅ, who came to hills after the siege of Chittaur. He was employed by a hill Raja for ten or twelve months who wanted to retain RƒÅma Si·πÉha in his country. The hill Raja asked for the daughter of Raja of Bƒ´nƒÅtƒ´, a BagƒÅle K·π£etrƒ´ and married her to RƒÅma Si·πÉha. They had six sons over 10‚Äì12 years, one of whom was recognized by the title of KumÃêvara Kha·∏çkƒÅ for bravery displayed in the battle against Raja of SatƒÅn Ko·π≠. The title was used by his descendants. RƒÅma Si·πÉha was suddenly met by his younger brother who requested him to return Chittaur for once and RƒÅma Si·πÉha died reaching there. The hill Raja made RƒÅma Si·πÉha's son RƒÅut Kunwar a nobleman (SardƒÅr) and commandant of the army. AhirƒÅma Kunwar, a son of RƒÅut Kunwar, was invited by King of Kaski and was made nobleman with a birta or jagir of Dhuage Saghu village. King of Kaski asked the hand of AhirƒÅma's daughter, who was a great beauty through only Kalas Puja to which AhirƒÅma replied to give his daughter only through lawful marriage. King brought his troops and tried to take on the village by force. AhirƒÅma was supported by the villagers belonging to ParƒÅjulƒ´ ThƒÅpƒÅ caste and a war was initiated. On the same day, AhirƒÅma took his immediate family including two sons namely; Ram Krishna Kunwar and Jaya Krishna Kunwar, to King of Gorkha, Prithvi Narayan Shah where lands of Kunwar-Khola was given to them as birta. John Whelpton opines that Kunwar origin legend which states that first of their ancestors to enter hill married a daughter of Bagale Kshetri might have directed their family links to Bagale Thapa, the clan of Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa. Rana dynasts; Prabhakar, Gautam and Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana claim the descent of Ranas of Nepal from Kunwar Kumbhakaran Singh, younger brother of Guhila King of Mewar, Rawal Ratnasimha. During the first siege of Chittorgarh in 1303 A.D., Kumbhakaran Singh's descendants left Mewar to north towards Himalayan foothills according to the book \\" Rana's Of Nepal\\" where the preface is written by Arvind Singh Mewar.  Historical background  Sardar Ram Krishna Kunwar, prominent male ancestor of Ranas of Nepal The founder of this dynasty was Jang Bahadur Rana, who belonged to Kunwar family which was then considered a minor noble family of Kshatriya status. Jang Bahadur was a son of Gorkhali governor Bal Narsingh Kunwar and nephew of Mathabarsingh Thapa, the reigning Prime Minister of Nepal (1843‚Äì1845) from the Thapa dynasty. Bal Narsingh Kunwar was the son of Kaji Ranajit Kunwar and grandson of Sardar Ram Krishna Kunwar, who was prominent military general of King Prithvi Narayan Shah. Ram Krishna Kunwar was born to Ahiram Kunwar. There were ample of rewards and recognitions received by Sardar Ram Krishna Kunwar from the Gorkhali monarch Prithvi Narayan. His grandson Bal Narsingh was initially a follower of the renounced King Rana Bahadur Shah and Kaji Bhimsen Thapa, and followed the King in his exile to Banaras on 1 May 1800. On the night of 25 April 1806, King Rana Bahadur was killed by step- brother Sher Bahadur in desperation after which Bal Narsingh immediately killed the King's assassin. He was a close ally of the influential minister Bhimsen Thapa, who initiated a great massacre at Bhandarkhal garden following the chaos from the King's murder. Following closeness to Mukhtiyar Bhimsen, he became the son-in-law of Bhimsen's brother Kaji Nain Singh Thapa of Thapa dynasty. The close relatives and supporters of Thapa faction replaced the old courtiers and administrators. The Kunwar family came to power being relatives of powerful Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa. Similarly, Kunwars were related to Pande dynasty by their maternal grandmother Rana Kumari Pande who was daughter of Mulkaji Ranajit Pande.  Rise of Jung Bahadur  Jung Bahadur Kunwar Ranaji, founder of Rana dynasty Bal Narsingh's son Kaji Jung Bahadur Kunwar became a significant person in the central politics of Nepal during the prime ministership of his uncle Mathabar Singh Thapa. On 17 May 1845 around 11 pm, Mathabar Singh was summoned to the royal palace and was assassinated in a cold blood by Jung Bahadur on the royal orders. He was considered to have been merciless, ruthless and fatal due to his association with Mathabar Singh. Jung Bahadur was made a Kaji (equivalent to minister) after following the order of assassination of Mathabar. On the night of 14 September 1846, Queen Rajya Lakshmi Devi summoned the courtiers on the mysterious murderer of her aide General Kaji Gagan Singh Bhandari, to which courtiers hurried to the Kot quickly. Many of the courtiers were unarmed except for a sword, as they had responded immediately to the royal summons. The armies allocated by Jung Bahadur Rana also had taken most of the arms of courtiers who had managed to bring them. Queen Rajya Lakshmi Devi and King Rajendra Bikram Shah were also present in the Kot. Queen Rajya Lakshmi demanded the execution of Kaji Bir Keshar (Kishor) Pande on alleged suspicion to which General Abhiman Singh Rana Magar looked towards King for confirmation. Jang misinformed Queen that Abhiman Singh's troops were arriving for overpowering the Queen's faction and demanded an immediate arrest. Abhiman tried to force his way out and was killed by Jung's soldier. In the chaos followed, Jung and his brothers began bloodshed and many rival nobles and courtiers were eliminated by them. The letter to British Resident Henry Montgomery Lawrence stated that there were 32 Bharadars (courtiers) killed in the massacre. Bhandarkhal massacre episode When Jang Bahadur refused the Junior Queen's request to place Prince Ranendra in the place of Crown Prince Surendra of Nepal, the Queen secretly contacted the victims of Kot and conspired to assassinate Jung Bahadur in the royal Bhandarkhal garden. After receiving a command from the Queen to come to Bhandarkhal, Jang Bahadur took his fully armed troops and headed towards the garden. The troops killed the chief conspirator, Birdhwaj Basnyat on the way, and marched towards Bhandarkhal where seeing Jang Bahadur approach fully armed with his troops, the other conspirators started to flee. 23 people were killed in the massacre while 15 escaped. In the 23rd of September 1846, all officers of military and bureaucracy were called upon to their respective offices within 10 days. Then, Jung Bahadur appointed his brothers and nephews to the highest ranks of the government. He consolidated the position of premiership after conducting Kot massacre (Kot Parva) and Bhandarkhal Parva on the basic templates provided by his maternal grand-uncle Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa. Rana Regime; Rule of Jang After the massacres of Kot and Bhandarkhal, the Thapas, Pandes, Basnyats and other citizens had settled in Banaras. Similarly, some citizens had gone to settle in Nautanwa and Bettiah. Chautariya Guru Prasad Shah too had gone to live with the King of Bettiah. After knowing about the presence of the King and the Queen in Benaras, Guru Prasad went there and started to congregate an army and a plan to execute Jung Bahadur started to be formed. Battle of Alau In 12 May 1847, Jung Bahadur gave a speech in Tundikhel. There he accused the King of the attempted assassination of the Prince and the Prime Minister. The Council then decided to dethrone King Rajendra deeming him mentally ill, and on the same day Surendra was crowned as the new king of Nepal. Hearing the news of the coronation of Surendra, Rajendra decided to take the responsibility of removing Jung Bahadur upon himself and declaring himself as the leader of the army, he left Benaras. Rajendra then appointed Guru Prasad Shah as the Chief of the Army for the operation of removal of Jung Bahadur Rana from Nepal and started to accumulate weapons and training the troops. Antagonism from the British-India Company forced Rajendra and his troops to enter Nepal. On 23 July, the troops reached a village called Alau in Bara and set a camp there. One spy group of the Government of Nepal was keeping close eyes on the event of the rebel groups at Bettiah. They sent the news to Jung Bahadur, immediately after which he sent a troop in the leadership of Sanak Singh Tandon to Alau. They were told to suppress the rebellions, arrest Rajendra and bring him to Kathmandu. On 27 July, the Gorakhnath Paltan (Gorakhnath Battalion) reached and rested in a village called Simraungadh, not too far from Alau. The battle of Alau was a decisive one between the forces of King Rajendra and Jang Bahadur. The King lost significantly in the battle. If the massacre of Kot had established Jung Bahadur as a dictator, the battle of Alau had helped him strengthen his dictatorship. Rajendra was imprisoned in an old palace in Bhaktapur.  Rise to royalty  On 15 May 1848, a Lal Mohar (Red sealed document) was issued claiming descent from Ranas of Mewar and authorizing the Kunwar family of Jang Bahadur to style themselves as Kunwar Ranaji. On 6 August 1856, Jang Bahadur Kunwar (now Ranaji) was conferred the title of Maharaja (Great King) of Kaski and Lamjung, two former hill principalities, by King of Nepal, Surendra Bikram Shah. Rana Regime; Rule of the Shamshers Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, the first Shamsher Rana ruler In 1885, the Shumsher family, the nephews of Jang Bahadur, murdered many of the sons of Jung Bahadur and took over Nepal in a military coup d'√©tat thus bringing in the rule of the Shamsher Rana family also known as the Satra Bhai (17 brothers) Rana family. They murdered Sri Teen Maharaja Ranodip Singh and occupied the hereditary throne of Prime Minister. After this they added Jang Bahadur to their name, although they were descended from Jang's younger brother Dhir Shamsher  Kunwar family tree  Rana Prime Ministers  Nine Rana rulers took the hereditary office(s) of Prime Minister, Supreme Commander-in-Chief and Grand Master of the Royal Orders.

It runs generally from Ogeechee, Georgia, where the line splits from the CSX Savannah Subdivision, which is the former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad's Savannah-Jacksonville route, and Riceboro. It does not have any of its own locomotives; it uses Georgia Central power. Ownership The Riceboro Southern is owned and operated by its parent, the Georgia Central Railway, LP, which is owned by Rail Link, a subsidiary of Genesee & Wyoming Inc. Business The sole purpose of the shortline is serving the Interstate Paper Company and SNF Chemtall, a chemical manufacturer, both located in Riceboro, and taking the freight cars to Savannah, where they interchange with CSX. History The line was built in 1894 by the Florida Northern Railroad. It was an extension of the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad north to Savannah, Georgia to connect with the South Bound Railroad in Savannah. The Florida Northern Railroad was eventually absorbed by the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad by 1893. In 1900, the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and the line became Seaboard's main line. Seaboard Air Line became the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad after merging with the Atlantic Coast Line in 1967. The merged company became the CSX Corporation in the 1980s. CSX abandoned the S Line between Riceboro and Seals, Georgia gradually from 1985 to 1986. CSX leased the line to Riceboro Southern Railway in 2004.

A dasymeter which allows weighing acts as a densimeter used to measure the density of gases. Principle The Principle of Archimedes permits to derive a formula which does not rely on any information of volume: A sample, the big sphere in the adjacent images, of known mass-density is weighed in vacuum and then immersed into the gas and weighed again. : \\\\frac { \\\\text{density of sphere}} { \\\\text {density of gas} } = \\\\frac { \\\\text{weight of sphere}} { \\\\text{weight of sphere} - \\\\text{weight of immersed sphere}}\\\\, : (The above formula was taken from the article buoyancy and still has to be solved for the density of the gas.) :From the known mass density of the sample (sphere) and its two weight-values, the mass-density of the gas can be calculated as: : { \\\\text {density of gas} } = \\\\frac { \\\\text{weight of sphere} - \\\\text{weight of immersed sphere}} { \\\\text{weight of sphere}} \\\\times {\\\\text{density of sphere}} Construction and use It consists of a thin sphere made of glass, ideally with an average density close to that of the gas to be investigated.

It is a plateau 2,000 ft (600 m) above sea level, 300 ft to 400 ft (90 m to 120 m) above the surrounding countryside, extending 20 mi (32 km) from north to south and 40 mi (64 km) from east to west. Rising 1,031 feet, North Dakota's most prominent peak, Boundary Butte, is located at the western edge of the plateau. It has timber, numerous lakes, and small deposits of low-grade manganese. One of the largest lakes in the Turtle Mountains is Lake Metigoshe, which straddles the international border, with about one-eighth of the lake in Canada. The region is home to Turtle Mountain Provincial Park, a state park, two historic sites, and various hunting and fishing opportunities. Turtle Mountain is the traditional territory of the Plains Ojibwe, as well as part of the M√©tis homeland. Rapid colonization and settlement in the 19th century, along with the establishment of a firm border between Canada and the United States, displaced many Indigenous peoples to and from the region. Some identify as the Turtle Mountain Chippewa, who are federally recognized and whose reservation in the valley on the southeastern edge of the plateau. History The Plains Ojibwe have a long established history in the Turtle Mountain region and the surrounding area. East of Turtle mountain at Pembina lived one Ojibwe group, as well as a number of M√©tis families. The M√©tis hunted and fished in the Turtle Mountains and increasingly moved westward from Pembina in search of declining buffalo populations. When the federal government agreed that Pembina would be a part of the United States in 1818, the M√©tis living there, along with a number of Chippewa with kinship ties to the M√©tis, and some Ojibwe claimed land near Turtle Mountain. The federal government recognized and designated this group the Pembina Band, but this did not include all the Ojibwe peoples already established at Turtle Mountain. The misidentification of all Ojibwe as part of the Pembina Band has prevented their full assertion of rights. Throughout the 19th century, the Pembina band was broken up and dispossessed of their lands as the government opened up the area for settlement. Among these groups are the Turtle Mountain Chippewa, and the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa. Environment= Wildlife  The Turtle Mountain area is covered by deciduous forest. Woodland overstory species are primarily green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), Manitoba maple (Acer negundo), American elm (Ulmus americana), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera). Common shrubs in the forest understory include beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), saskatoon berry (Amelanchier alnifolia), nannyberry (Viburnum lentago), dogwood (Cornus sericea), highbush cranberry (Viburnum trilobum) and pincherry (Prunus pensylvanica). The area near Mary Lake includes the spotted coralroot orchid (Corallorhiza maculata) and calypso orchid (Calypso bulbosa). Turtle Mountain is home to moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor canadensis), raccoon (Procyon lotor) and mink (Neovison vison), as well as birds like loons (Gavia species), great blue heron (Ardea herodias herodias), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), the double- crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and red-necked grebes (Podiceps grisegena). The abundant small lakes support painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), the Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens), and the barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium).Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship: Turtle Mountain Provincial ParkTurtle Mountain provincial Park Management Plan. Manitoba Natural Resources, 1985. 37 pages.Nature North: Manitoba Herps Atlas [accessed January 1, 2014]  Coal mining  Following the discovery of coal in 1879 there was coal mining in the Turtle Mountains near Old Deloraine town site in Manitoba and along ravines on the western flank of Turtle Mountain. The Lennox mine opened in 1883 and mining continued intermittently at the Voden, McArthur, McKay, and Manitoba Coal Company mines until 1908. When higher quality coal was found elsewhere and the Trans-Canada Railway was built, the mines closed. Small scale coal mining was revived during the Depression because Turtle Mountain lignite was cheaper than higher coal grades from Saskatchewan. Peak annual production of the McArthur, Henderson, Deep Ravine, Salter, Powne, and Deloraine Coal Company mines averaged over 1000 tons each. However, the Salter and Henderson mines produced 95% of Manitoba's coal over a span of about eight years. The last mine closed in 1943 due to labour shortages during World War II and changed economic conditions.Manitoba Heritage CouncilBannatyne, B.B. 1978. Summary of available data on lignite deposits.

Bermondt-Avalov was promoted Major General in 1918. He took over the White Forces in the Baltic from Prince Anatoly Lieven, who commanded a contingent in the Baltische Landwehr. In 1919, his forces joined those of Major General R√ºdiger von der Goltz to form the so-called \\"West Russian Volunteer Army\\" which attempted to proclaim the \\"Western Central Government\\" in Riga. German Free Corps were operating in the Baltic States since spring 1919 to keep away the Red Army. In summer 1919 the Entente States and the German government ordered the troops back, but the soldiers refused. Until beginning of October most of the 40,000 German volunteers entered the Bermondt-Army consisting of about 10,000 Russians, mostly former prisoners of war released from German camps. With this masquerade the Germans tried to keep their engagement in the Baltics and to secure German interests in the area. They used Bermondt for their own purposes. Since the German government stopped paying for the troops, finances were coming mostly from German economic leaders that had interests in the Baltics. At the end the Army printed its own money. The Western Russian army managed to capture Zemgale, Courland (except LiepƒÅja), Samogitia and entered Riga, but later were defeated by the Latvian and Lithuanian armies, with the help of the Estonian forces. This Baltic diversion of Bermondt-Avalov heavily contributed to his already existing reputation as an \\"adventurer\\" (such as General Bulak-Balakovich) especially among Latvian historians. Under pressure of the Baltic independent states then in formation, the Entente and the German government withdrew the Army. By mid- December 1919 the last Russo-German soldiers crossed the borders into Germany (Tilsit).Jobst Knigge: Kontinuit√§t deutscher Kriegsziele im Baltikum. Deutsche Baltikum-Politik 1918/19 und das Kontinuit√§tsproblem, Hamburg 2003 Post war Pavel Bermondt-Avalov then emigrated to Western Europe, where he published a book of memoirs. He lived in Germany from 1921 and was involved in right wing and fascist movements. Strongly supportive of National Socialism, he established his own movement, the Russian National Socialist Movement. Despite this he was imprisoned by the Nazis in 1939 along with other Russian exiles and deported. He settled in Belgrade and later moved to the United States. He died in New York City in 1973.

Like many folk songs, the authorship is unattributed, there is no strict version of the lyrics, and it is often referred to by its opening line \\"There once was a troop o' Irish dragoons\\". The song is also known by a variety of other names, the most common of them being \\"Peggy-O\\", \\"Fennario\\", and \\"The Maid of Fife\\". Lyrics Of the many versions, one of the most intricate is: Meaning The song is about the unrequited love of a captain of Irish dragoons for a beautiful Scottish girl in Fyvie. The narration is in the third person, through the voice of one of the captain's soldiers. The captain promises the girl material comfort and happiness, but the girl refuses the captain's advances saying she would not marry a foreigner or a soldier. The captain subsequently leaves Fyvie. In two different variations of the song, he threatens to burn the town(s) if his offer is rejected, or alternately save the town if his offer is accepted. He later dies of a broken heart, or battle wounds, or possibly both. Several variations on this theme exist. The soldier also proposes marriage in some versions. Some versions have the girl declare her love for the soldier, but only to be stopped short by a reluctant mother. Geographical and historical allusions The song is set in Fyvie, a small town with a historic castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Some sources claim that the original song suggests the region of Fife (as the \\"Fair Maid of Fife\\"), but the references to the River Ythan, Aberdeen and other locations near Fyvie like Gight, confirm that the original song was set in Fyvie, Scotland. It is probably better not to read strong historical associations into the song, although it is just possible that the song refers to the capture of the Fyvie Castle by Montrose's Royalist army in 1644. (A large part of this army was Irish, but they were not dragoons.) Variants across time and space The oldest known version of the Scottish ballad is called \\"The Bonnie Lass O' Fyvie\\". Another early transcribed version is given under the title \\"Bonnie Barbara-O\\". An early English version \\"Handsome Polly-O\\" is also present, though in slightly different settings. Another English version is called \\"Pretty Peggy of Derby\\". The song probably travelled with Scottish immigrants to America. It is recorded in the classic English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians by Cecil Sharp. Variants of the song refer to the War of 1812 and the American Civil War. A Dixie version of the song makes the final resting place of the captain to be Louisiana. The last two stanzas from the Bob Dylan version is typical of such Americanized forms, and goes as follows: Over time, the name of Fyvie also got corrupted, and phonetically similar permutations like \\"Fennario\\", \\"Fernario\\", \\"Finario\\", \\"Fidio\\", \\"Ivory\\" or \\"Ireo\\" were placed in its stead to fit the metre and rhyme. As a result, the song is commonly referred to as \\"Fennario\\". The 1960s folk music movement saw \\"Peggy-O\\" become a common song in many concerts owing to its clear melody and lilting rhyme. Linguistics The song was originally composed and sung in Scots. It then made its way into mainstream English, but retains its Scottish flavour. Words like birk (for birch), lass and bonnie are typically Scots as are words like brae (hill) and braw (splendid). As is typical of such cases, quite a few of the less familiar words degenerated into nonsense words as the song travelled over cultures, the most interesting ones probably being Ethanside for Ythanside (banks of the River Ythan), and brasselgeicht for braes o' Gight (hills of Gight). Renditions Bob Dylan The earliest version to be recorded was by John Strachan in 1951. The Southern American version of the song was arranged for the harmonica by Bob Dylan on his eponymous debut album in 1962, under the title \\"Pretty Peggy-O\\". He starts off the song with the introduction \\"I've been around this whole country but I never yet found Fennario\\", as a playful remark on the fact that the song has been borrowed and cut off its original \\"setting\\". Dylan began playing the song live again in the 90s, using the lyrics and melody of the Grateful Dead version. Joan Baez Joan Baez recorded a lyrical version under the title \\"Fennario\\" on her 1963 Vanguard Records album Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2. Simon and Garfunkel Simon and Garfunkel also recorded a heavily harmonized arrangement of the song titled \\"Peggy-O\\" as part of their Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. album of 1964 and Columbia Records studio recordings of the 1960s (which was released on the box set The Columbia Studio Recordings (1964-1970) in 2001). Simon and Garfunkel sing the variant of the song where the captain threatens to burn the city down if his advances are refused. Grateful Dead The Grateful Dead have variously arranged and sung this song on 265 known occasions between 1973 and 1995, using Fen-nar-io and Fi-dio as the name of the place depending on metre constraints. The place Fennario is also mentioned in their song \\"Dire Wolf\\", on the album Workingman's Dead. The song was titled \\"Peggy-O\\", and was sung by Jerry Garcia using the following lyrics: The song appears as \\"Fennario\\" on Jerry Garcia's album Run for the Roses. Following the Grateful Dead's disbandment in 1995 after Garcia's death, \\"Peggy-O\\" continued to be performed by offshoot bands including Bob Weir & RatDog, Phil Lesh & Friends, The Other Ones, The Dead, BK3, Furthur, Billy & The Kids, Dead & Company, and Bob Weir & Wolf Bros. Other artists *The Clancy Brothers recorded the song as \\"The Maid of Fife-E-O\\" on the 1961 album, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, and later as \\"Maid of Fife\\" on their 1965 album, Recorded Live in Ireland, with Tommy Makem and on their 1973 album, Greatest Hits, with Louis Killen. *The Journeymen (John Phillips, Scott McKenzie, Richard Weissman) recorded a version with an American Civil War context as \\"Fennario\\" on their 1961 debut album The Journeymen (Capitol Records ST 1629). *Judy Collins recorded a version as \\"Fannerio\\" on her 1962 album Golden Apples of the Sun. *Hoyt Axton recorded a version of \\"Peggy O\\" for the album Greenback Dollar (1963). *The Chad Mitchell Trio recorded a variant (in which the colonel shoots the captain after the call to tarry) on their 1963 album Singin' Our Minds under the title, \\"Bonny Streets of Fyve-io\\". *Les Compagnons De La Chanson released a cover version in French on a 7\\" EP, under the title \\"Peggy O\\" in 1963. *The Corries recorded a version on their first album in 1965. *Bob Lind included a similar version of the song, but under the title \\"Fennario\\", on the Verve album The Elusive Bob Lind, released in 1966. *Martin Carthy recorded a song sharing some lyrics, but with a quite different tune and narrative arc, called \\"Handsome Polly-O\\" on his album Shearwater in 1972. *The Black Watch included \\"Lass of Fyve\\" on their 1975 album Scotch on the Rocks, sung by a trio with the pipes and drums joining in at the end of the song. *WWE recorded a version of the song to serve as the entrance theme for Rowdy Roddy Piper, replacing Scotland the Brave. *The Aberdeen-based group, Old Blind Dogs covered the song on their New Tricks album in 1992. *Malinky, with lead vocals by Karine Polwart, included \\"The Bonnie Lass of Fyvie\\"' on their 2000 album Last Leaves. *\\"Peggy-O\\" has been covered by the bluegrass band Trampled By Turtles, such as at their 10,000 Lakes Festival performance in 2007. *Jefferson Starship recorded a version of \\"Frenario\\" for the 2008 album Jefferson's Tree of Liberty. *The Irish Rovers recorded the song on The Irish Rovers' Gems. *Antonio Breschi arranged the song as \\"Fennario\\" on his album Songs of the North in 1996. *The National recorded the song for the Grateful Dead tribute Day of the Dead in 2015.

Location It was extended north five miles from Sandersville to a kaolin mine and processing plants near Deepstep, GA. It continues to operate the same nine miles as of 2017 along with two branch lines and is nicknamed The Kaolin Road. The company has its main office, dispatchers, locomotive and railcar maintenance shops, maintenance-of-way equipment shed, and locomotive fuel towers and sanding tower, all located in historic downtown Sandersville, Georgia. Equipment The Sandersville Railroad Company owns a fleet of modern diesel electric switcher locomotives built by the Electro Motive Division of General Motors Corporation (EMD) but their first Diesel Electric Locomotive was the Fairbanks and Morse H-12-44 numbered SAN 100 that's now been long retired. They have 4 EMD SW1500s with the road numbers SAN 1100, 1300, 1400, and 1500 respectively. The newest addition to the fleet is an EMD MP15DC purchased in October 2016 from Norfolk Southern Railroad, it has the road number SAN 1600 and was bought to replace the EMD SW1200 Road Number SAN 1200 that was sold in the spring of 2018. The SAN 1600 is as of July 2018 still in its Norfolk Southern style black and white paint but now has the Sandersville Railroad style paint job with the road number SAN 1600 to align with the rest of the fleet. The EMD SW1500 SAN 1400 was also originally a Norfolk Southern locomotive and was delivered in the black and white just as the SAN 1600 but has now been repainted to the standard Sandersville Railroad Company paint scheme of a white body with a red single stripe running along both sides of the hood ending near the belt driven radiator fan on the front of the units, with the word Sandersville in red on both sides, and red road numbers and reporting marks SAN in red on the cabs in the style of the old Seaboard Air Line Railroad. The Company also owns two slug units which the SAN refers to as \\"boosters\\". The first one is a former Rock Island Railroad Company GE (General Electric)-built Universal Series U25B road Switcher that was turned from a conventional locomotive to a Road Slug later in its life. The operators cab, auxiliary cab, diesel engine (prime mover), air compressor, and radiator were all removed from the frame, and a large concrete ballast block was installed along with a new long full length hood was installed that has electric powered traction motor blowers on each end to cool the 4 DC electric traction motors on each axle as it did when it was a regular engine. The cab has headlights on each end and a ratchet style handbrake on the B-end. The fuel tank of the engine was removed and it became a full road slug that now receives its power from whatever mother unit it is multi-unit (MU) connected to. The Rock Island Railroad later sold one of its converted GE road slugs to the Sandersville Railroad Company and it became the SAN 90. In 1994 the company bought an additional slug unit from Norfolk Southern that became the SAN 91 that has a shorter body and vertically mounted \\"tombstone\\" style headlights. All engines in the fleet have the twin \\"ditch\\" gauge lights on each end as well. Up until the year 2009 the company also used a former Louisville & Nashville Railroad bay window caboose that's road number was SAN 60 but it was retired as the company didn't want to have to keep its old friction bearing axles constantly serviced and FRA Certified. It was taken through downtown Sandersville, Georgia during the October of year 2009 \\"Kaolin Festival Parade\\" on the back of a lowboy tuck trailer in place of the railroad's normally used steam engine \\"General\\" parade float. After this, it was offloaded by mobile cranes back onto the tracks at the bulk transfer yard and then carried back to the Sandersville Yard by one of the locomotives to be parked behind 3 former Illinois Central Railroad wide-vision cupola cabooses owned by the company. The Kaolin Road used to also own cushion underframe boxcars but they were all retired and sold to Norfolk Southern. The other fleet of railcars the company owns is a fleet of large and small covered hoppers used to transport bulk (powder) kaolin clay and a fleet of open-top hoppers for transporting pulpwood chips to paper mills. Service They service the many Kaolin processing plants in the area such as the Kentucky Tennessee Clay Company and Imerys Pigments Plant 2 both in Deepstep, and the Imerys Pigments Plant 1, KaMin LLC., Burgess Pigment Company, and Thiele Kaolin Company plants, all in Sandersville. The Railroad also services Bulk Chemical Services, Fulghum Fibers Pulpwood Chip Mill, and the two Duraline pipe manufacturing plants. The profitable road also handles inbound and outbound grain shipments. The company interchanges in Tennille, Georgia with the Norfolk Southern Railway Company's Savannah District Trains of their Georgia Division. The NS trains 191 and 192 from Brosnan Yard in Macon, Georgia to Columbia, South Carolina and the NS Trains 372 and 373 with their companion NS Trains 378 and 377 from Brosnan Yard in Macon, Georgia to Dillard Yard in Savannah, Georgia all make pick ups and drop offs in Tennille for the locals NS G23 and G24 as well as the Sandersville Railroad Company. In 2018, NS began operating an evening yard switcher to switch inbound cars from Macon, Savannah, and Augusta. The Sandersville Railroad has a new bulk transfer (Transflow) terminal located on Waco Mill Road near Tennille that offloads bulk products into waiting B&H; Transfer Company tractor-trailer rigs. This facility is located across the road from the mainline and freight yard on the site of a former pulpwood loading yard that the company used to load pulpwood onto flatcars for transport to paper mills. The company also installed a state-of-the-art weigh-in-motion scale near its Waco Mill Yard in 2002 that weighs trains after being activated by a radio link from the locomotive. It lets the crews know it's working by activating the yellow and red signals and by speaking a computer radio message over the road channel. The scales transmit a weight chart to the office downtown so they will know which cars are overloaded and which ones are not. The Sandersville Railroad Company is one of the most profitable and professional shortline railroads in North America and has a well-maintained mainline of 132 and 136 pound-per-foot rail. Ownership The Kaolin Road has been privately owned by the Tarbuttons of Sandersville, Georgia since 1916. Ben Tarbutton III is acting President of the SAN. His grandfather was also once president of the Central of Georgia Railroad. The Tarbutton family still runs the company daily and can be found in the main office in Sandersville during operations. Mr. Ben J. Tarbutton and Mr. Hugh M. Tarbutton had been at the helm of the company for many years. Mr. Hugh died in 2015 but his brother continues to run the railroad while Mr. Hugh's son Charles Tarbutton runs the trucking company which no longer has any affiliation with the railroad other than utilizing the railroad's transload facility.

History Engraving of Sch√§ftlarn Abbey from the \\"Churbaierische Atlas\\" of Anton Wilhelm Ertl, 1690 The new baroque buildings; copperplate engraving by Michael Wening, 1701 The monastery was founded in 762 by Waltrich, a Benedictine monk of noble family, on his own land. During the next two centuries the monastery grew as a result of various gifts and endowments (among them the estates of Schwabing and Hesselohe). From 1140 to its dissolution during the secularisation of Bavaria in 1803, Sch√§ftlarn belonged to the Premonstratensian Order. In 1866 King Ludwig II of Bavaria restored possession to the Benedictines, who set up a secondary school (\\"Gymnasium\\") here. The abbey is a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. School The school did close between 1941 and 1945 by the National Socialists. Immediately after the war the school, which is private, was re-opened as a \\"Progymnasium\\", that is to say, only for German forms 5 to 10 (equivalent to the Upper Fifth form), to the year before the Abitur. Abitur examinations were not conducted in Sch√§ftlarn until 1973. In 2005 the school had about 420 pupils, both day pupils (boys and girls) and boarders (boys only). Buildings Sch√§ftlarn Abbey Architecture The present abbey buildings were constructed in 1707 to plans by Giovanni Antonio Viscardi. The church of Saint Denis, built as the abbey church, is a beautiful example of the Rococo architectural style. It was begun as a new building from 1733 to 1740 under Francois de Cuvilli√©s the Elder, and finished during the period from 1751 to 1760 by Johann Georg Gunetzrhainer and Johann Michael Fischer. From 1754 to 1756 the church was painted and decorated with stucco by Johann Baptist Zimmermann. From 1756 to 1764 Johann Baptist Straub worked on the altars and the chancel.

His film The Mattei Affair won the Palme d'Or at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. Rosi's films, especially those of the 1960s and 1970s, often appeared to have political messages. While the topics for his later films became less politically oriented and more angled toward literature, he continued to direct until 1997, his last film being the adaptation of Primo Levi's book, The Truce. At the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival 13 of his films were screened, in a section reserved for film-makers of outstanding quality and achievement. He received the Honorary Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement, accompanied by the screening of his 1962 film Salvatore Giuliano. In 2012 the Venice Biennale awarded Rosi the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement. Biography=Origins and early career Rosi was born in Naples in 1922. His father worked in the shipping industry, but was also a cartoonist and had, at one time, been reprimanded for his satirical drawings of Benito Mussolini and King Vittorio Emmanuel III. During the Second World War Rosi went to college alongside Giorgio Napolitano who was to become Italian President. He studied law and then embarked on a career as an illustrator of children's books. At the same time he began working as a reporter for . There he became friendly with Raffaele La Capria, Aldo Giuffr√® and Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, with each of whom he would later often collaborate. His show business career began in 1946 as an assistant to Ettore Giannini for the stage production of a work by Salvatore Di Giacomo. He then entered the film industry and worked as an assistant to Luchino Visconti on La Terra Trema (\\"The Earth Trembles\\", 1948) and Senso (\\"Sense\\", 1954). He wrote several screenplays, including Bellissima (\\"Beautiful\\", 1951) and The City Stands Trial (\\"Processo alla citt√†\\", 1952), and shot a few scenes of the film Red Shirts (\\"Camicie rosse\\", 1952) by Goffredo Alessandrini. In 1956 he co- directed, with Vittorio Gassman, the film Kean ‚Äì Genio e sregolatezza (\\"Kean ‚Äì Genius and recklessness\\"), about the Shakespearean actor Edmund Kean. His emergence as a director is considered to be his 1958 film La sfida (The Challenge), based on the story of Camorra boss Pasquale Simonetti, known as Pasquale 'e Nola, and Pupetta Maresca. The realist nature of this film caused a stir in alluding to mafia control of the government. Of the film, Rosi himself said, \\"A director makes his first film with passion and without regard for what has gone before\\". But David Shipman comments \\"... but this is in fact a reworking of La Terra Trema, with the Visconti arias replaced by Zavattini's naturalism.\\" The following year he directed The Magliari (\\"I magliari\\"), in which the main character, an Italian immigrant in Germany, travels between Hamburg and Hanover and clashes with a Neapalitan mafioso boss over control of the fabric market. Shipman writes: > I magliari (1959) also concerns racketeers, and they are rival con-men > (Alberto Sordi, Renato Salvatori) preying on their compatriots, immigrant > workers in Germany. Sordi, like the protagonist in La sfida, manages to > antagonise his colleagues more than his rivals ‚Äì and this was to be a > continuing theme in Rosi's films. For the moment it means that both films > end dispiritedly, and they are further weakened by an uncertain grasp of > narrative ‚Äì though that is partly hidden in the vigorous handling of > individual scenes and the photography of Gianni Di Venanzo. 1960s Rosi was one of the central figures of the politicised post- neorealist 1960s and 1970s of Italian cinema, along with Gillo Pontecorvo, Pier Paolo Pasolini, the Taviani brothers, Ettore Scola and Valerio Zurlini. Dealing with a corrupt postwar Italy, Rosi's movies take on controversial issues, such as Salvatore Giuliano, a film that won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival in 1962. The film examined the life of the Sicilian gangster Giuliano, using the technique of a long series of flashbacks, one that became very popular thereafter. Shipman suggests that the film, with a \\"superb unity of the landscape and people of Sicily\\" ... \\"made Rosi's international reputation.\\" In 1963 he directed Rod Steiger in the film Hands over the City (\\"Le mani sulla citt√†\\"), in which he courageously denounced the collusion between the various government departments and the crooked urban reconstruction programmes in Naples. The film was awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. The film, together with Salvatore Giuliano, is generally considered the first of his films concerning political issues, later to be expressed in the flexible and spontaneous acting of Gian Maria Volont√©. Rosi himself explained the film's purpose: \\"What interests me passionately is how a character behaves in the relation to the collectivity of society. I'm not making a study of character but of society. To understand what a man is like in his private drama you must begin to understand him in his public life\\". In The Moment of Truth (\\"Il momento della verit√†\\", 1965), Rosi changed what was planned as a documentary about Spain in to a film about bullfighter Miguel Marco Miguelin. Shipman comments: \\"The wide screen and colour footage of the corrida were incomparably superior to those seen outside Spain hitherto.\\" After this Rosi moved into the unfamiliar world of the movie fable with More Than a Miracle (also titled Cinderella Italian Style and Happily Ever After, Italian: \\"C'era una volta\\" ‚Äì \\"Once Upon a Time ...\\"). The film starred Sophia Loren and Omar Sharif, fresh from the success of the 1965 film Doctor Zhivago, although Rosi had initially asked for the part to be played by Marcello Mastroianni. 1970s His 1970 film Many Wars Ago (\\"Uomini contro\\") dealt with the absurdity of war in the context of the Trentino Front of 1916‚Äì17 during World War One, where Italian army officers demanded far too much of their men. It was based on the novel Un anno sull'altopiano by Emilio Lussu. The lead is played by Mark Frechette and the cost of the film was such that Rosi needed to secure Yugoslavian collaboration. Shipman writes: \\"The Alpine battlefield has been imaginatively and bloodily re-created, and photographed in steely colours by Pasqualino De Santis, but Rosi's urge to say something important ‚Äì doubtless intense after the last two films ‚Äì resulted only in clich√©: that military men are fanatics and war is hell.\\" The years 1972 to 1976 cemented Rosi's reputation internationally as a director who dealt with controversial subjects such as the mysterious death of oil magnate Enrico Mattei (The Mattei Affair, 1972, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival); the political machinations around gangster Lucky Luciano (Lucky Luciano, 1974), and corruption in the judiciary, Illustrious Corpses (\\"Cadaveri Eccellenti\\", 1976).John Patterson \\"Made in Italy\\", The Guardian, 14 February 2009 During the preparation of The Mattei Affair Rosi was in contact with Mauro De Mauro, the Sicilian journalist murdered in mysterious circumstances for reasons which, it is suspected, included an investigation on behalf of Rosi, into the death of the president of the Italian state-owned oil and gas conglomerate Eni. Lucky Luciano (1973) starred Gian Maria Volont√© with Steiger in a sub-plot about another dubious Italo-American. Edmond O'Brien featured as a UN man. Norman Mailer described the film as \\"the most careful, the most thoughtful, the truest, and the most sensitive to the paradoxes to a society of crime\\". In 1976 came the remarkable success Illustrious Corpses (\\"Cadaveri eccellenti\\"), based on the novel Equal Danger by Leonardo Sciascia, with Lino Ventura. The film is praised highly by Shipman, who describes it as: \\"a film so rich, so powerful and so absorbing that it leaves the spectator breathless. ... This is a film, rare in the history of cinema, in which location ‚Äì as opposed to decor ‚Äì is a character in its own right, commenting on the action.\\" Writing in The Observer, Russell Davies said, \\"Few directors select their shots with such flamboyant intelligence as this\\". In 1979 Rosi directed Christ Stopped at Eboli, based on the memoir of the same name by Carlo Levi, again with Volont√© as the protagonist. It won the Golden Prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival and was to win BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1983. Rosi had been invited by the state-owned television service RAI to select a subject for filming, and the four-part television programme was cut into a 141-minute feature film which he described as \\"a journey through my own conscience\\". Shipman writes, \\"the film retains all the mystery of Rosi's best work ‚Äì an enquiry where at least half the answers are withheld. In this enquiry there is a respect for the historical process, but the usual magisterial blend of art and dialectic is softened by a sympathy much deeper than that of Il Momento Della Verit√†. The occasional self-conscious shot that we associate with peasantry cannot mar it.\\" 1980s and 1990s After another successful film Three Brothers (\\"Tre fratelli\\", 1981), with Philippe Noiret, Michele Placido and Vittorio Mezzogiorno, Rosi wanted bring the novel The Truce by Primo Levi, to the big screen, but the suicide of the writer in April 1987 forced him to give the project up. The film was finally made only in 1997. He directed a film adaptation of Carmen (1984) with Pl√°cido Domingo and subsequently he worked on Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1987), adapted from the novel by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, which brought together a great cast including Gian Maria Volont√©, Ornella Muti, Rupert Everett, Anthony Delon and Lucia Bos√®. The film was shot in Mompox, Colombia. In 1990 he directed The Palermo Connection (\\"Dimenticare Palermo\\") with Jim Belushi, Mimi Rogers, Vittorio Gassman, Philippe Noiret and Giancarlo Giannini. He then returned to the theatre direction with the comedies of Eduardo De Filippo: Napoli milionaria!, Le voci di dentro and Filumena Marturano, all performed by Luca De Filippo. His last film as director was 1997's The Truce, based on holocaust survivor Levi‚Äôs memoir, and starring John Turturro. Rosi described the film in a 2008 interview with Variety as being about \\"the return to life.\\" Recognition, later life and death In 2005, for the film Hands over the City, he was awarded an Honorary Degree in \\"Urban and Environmental Planning\\" by the Mediterranea University of Reggio Calabria. The 58th edition of the Berlin International Film Festival in 2008 played tribute to Rosi by screening 13 films in its Homage section, a feature being reserved for film-makers of outstanding quality and achievement. He received the Honorary Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement on 14 February 2008, accompanied by the screening of Salvatore Giuliano. In 2009 he was awarded the Cavaliere della Legion d'Onore, in 2010 the \\"Golden Halberd\\" at the Trieste Film Festival and in May 2012 the Board of the Venice Biennale unanimously approved the proposal of its director Alberto Barber, to award Rosi the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at its 69th show. Barber praised Rosi for his \\"absolute rigor in historic reconstruction, never making any compromises on a political or ethical level, combined with engaging storytelling and splendid visuals.\\" On 27 October 2010 he became an honorary citizen of Matelica, the birthplace of Enrico Mattei, while in 2013, in the presence of the Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage Massimo Bra, he was given the honorary citizenship of Matera, where he had shot three of his films. In 2014 he took part in the film Born in the USE, co- produced by Renzo Rossellini and directed by Michele Dioma. In the last part of his life he lived on the Via Gregoriana in Rome near the Spanish Steps. In April 2010 his wife Giancarla Mandelli, died at the Hospital Sant Eugenio, as a result of burns caused by her dress catching fire from a cigarette. Rosi died, on 10 January 2015, at the age of 92,E' morto Francesco Rosi whilst at home, as a result of complications from bronchitis. A memorial service was held in Rome on 10 January, with a day-long viewing of the body at the Casa del Cinema. Fellow director Giuseppe Tornatore was among many acclaimed Italian film-makers who attended. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, Rosi's friend and former classmate, sent white roses. Italian director Giuseppe Piccioni said Rosi's work gave Italy \\"identity and dignity\\" continuing, \\"Rosi was one of those artists who lived his work like a mission.\\" Director Paolo Sorrentino dedicates his 2015 movie Youth with a simple end credit \\"For Francesco Rosi\\". Impact and legacy Rosi's films, especially those of the 1960s and 1970s, often appear to have political messages. As he matured as a director his film topics became less politically oriented and more angled toward literature. Despite the more traditional slant of his later work, Rosi continued to direct until 1997. The Variety Movie Guide says of Rosi: \\"Most films by Francesco Rossi probe well under the surface of people and events to establish a constant link between the legal and the illegal exercise of power.\\" Writing Rosi's obituary in The Guardian, David Robinson and John Francis Lane said: > In his best films, the director Francesco Rosi ... was essentially a > crusading, investigative journalist concerned with the corruption and > inequalities of the economically depressed Italian south. He believed that > ‚Äúthe audience should not be just passive spectators‚Äù: he wanted to make > people think and question. The British Film Institute, recognising that Rosi had made historical films, war pictures and family dramas, in a directorial career that spanned almost four decades, said \\"he will be remembered above all as the master of the ‚Äòcine-investigation‚Äô and an influence on several generations of artists, including the likes of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Roberto Saviano and Paolo Sorrentino. Interviewed by The New York Times after Rosi's death, actor John Turturro who played Primo Levi in Rosi's last film The Truce, called Rosi \\"something of a mentor\\". He said, \\"I would never have read all of Primo Levi‚Äôs work if not for him. There are a lot of films I never would have otherwise seen... He was a wonderful actor. He helped you physically as an actor. If he had trouble explaining something, he could act it out, and all the actors understood.\\" Awards=BAFTA Awarded by British Academy of Film and Television Arts: *1983 : BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film ‚Äì Christ Stopped at Eboli *1986 : nominated for Best Foreign Language Film ‚Äì Carmen Cannes Film Festival Awarded at the Cannes Film Festival: *1972 : Palme d'Or ‚Äì The Mattei Affair Venice Biennale *1963 : Golden Lion ‚Äì Hands over the City *2012 : Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement David di Donatello Award *1965 : Best Director ‚Äì The Moment of Truth *1976 : Best Director ‚Äì Illustrious Corpses *1976 : Best Film ‚Äì Illustrious Corpses *1979 : Best Director ‚Äì Christ Stopped at Eboli *1979 : Best Film ‚Äì Christ Stopped at Eboli *1981 : Best Director ‚Äì Three Brothers *1981 : Best Screenplay ‚Äì Three Brothers *1985 : Best Director ‚Äì Carmen *1981 : Best Film ‚Äì Carmen *1985 : Best Cinematography ‚Äì Carmen *1997 : Best Film ‚Äì The Truce *1997 : Best Director ‚Äì The Truce Moscow International Film Festival *1979 : Grand Prix ‚Äì Christ Stopped at Eboli Silver Ribbon The Nastro d'Argento, awarded by the Sindacato Nazionale Giornalisti Cinematografici Italiani: *1959: Best Original Film ‚Äì The Challenge *1963: Best Director ‚Äì Salvatore Giuliano *1981: Best Director ‚Äì Three Brothers *2014: Lifetime Achievement Award Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film *1981 : nomination for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ‚Äì Three Brothers Berlin Film Festival Awarded at the Berlin International Film Festival: *1962 : Silver Bear for Best Director ‚Äì Salvatore Giuliano *2008 : Honorary Golden Bear BIF (Bari International Film Festival) *2010 : \\"Premio Federico Fellini\\" for artistic excellence Honours * * 1995: Cavaliere di gran croce dell'Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana * * 1987: Grande ufficiale dell'Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana * * 2009: Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur Filmography=Director Rosi directed 20 films, starting with some scenes in Goffredo Alessandrini's Red Shirts.

Colchester Hunt is located close to the town of Clifton and the independent city of Fairfax.  History = 1970s  The community was formed in the 1970s on what had been farm land, making it one of the first major communities near the town of Clifton, Virginia. A distinguishing characteristic is the placement of the houses on the lots. Rather than being centered on the lots, the houses typically are set in one corner‚Äîresulting in some houses having very large side or back yards, with others having very large front yards. The houses were built with septic tanks, and still use that system. Although the houses initially were all-electric, gas mains were extended to the area and many houses converted to gas.  1980s  During the 1980s, the community went through rapid growth and development. More streets and homes were added to the area, and the present-day Fairfax Hunt was constructed.  1990s  The 1990s were about the time the community went to its maximum capacity of about 400 residents and 97 homes in the community. In 1998, an F0 tornado rolled right through the southern tier of the community. No homes were destroyed, but around 25 trees were knocked over. No deaths or injuries were reported.  Today  Today, the community's main roads are Saddle Horn Drive and Queen's Brigade Drive with other roads supporting them. It is served by Oak View Elementary School and by Robinson Secondary School.

In that election, she also lost her regional list seat. In the 2007 election, Grant was again elected as a regional list MSP for Highlands and Islands, as the Scottish Green Party's vote share collapsed and Labour won three list seats, and she was re-elected in the 2011 election.

Owned by Rogers Media, it broadcasts an all-news radio format branded as News 1130. CKWX's studios and offices are located at 2440 Ash Street in the Fairview neighbourhood of Vancouver. CKWX is a Class A clear- channel station, broadcasting at 50,000 watts, the maximum for Canadian AM stations. It shares the AM 1130 frequency with two other Class A stations, KWKH Shreveport and WBBR New York City. So CKWX broadcasts with a directional antenna at all times, using a two-tower array. The transmitter is located at North 6 Road at Blundell Road on Lulu Island in Richmond.FCCdata.org/CKWX CKWX's signal covers Southwest British Columbia and Northwest Washington state. At night, with a good radio, CKWX can be heard around Western Canada and the Northwestern United States. CKWX is also heard on an HD Radio subchannel, 96.9 CJAX-FM-HD2. History=Early years On April 1, 1923, the station first signed on the air. Its original city of license was Nanaimo, British Columbia, and its call sign was CFDC. It was owned by Arthur \\"Sparks\\" Holstead (1890-1971), operator of an automotive battery business. The station broadcast on 430 meters (670 kHz) with 10 watts of power (later increased to 50 watts). In 1925, the station switched frequencies to 730 AM and cut its power back to 10 watts to share time with Vancouver stations CFCQ, CKCD and CJKC.Historical information on CKCD at Canadian Communications Foundation CKFC Historical information on CKFC at Canadian Communications Foundation Holstead had a branch business at 1220 Seymour Street in Vancouver and decided to relocate CFDC there. The station was regularly on the air in its new locale by September 20, 1925, according to the radio listings in the Victoria Daily Colonist.Vancouver Daily Colonist, Sept. 20, 1925, pg. 28 The Department of Marine and Fisheries (which then regulated broadcasting in Canada) had not authorized CFDC's move to Vancouver and revoked the station's license as a result, but listener complaints led to the department granting a new license to the station.CFCD-AM (1923-1927) history at Canadian Communications Foundation Programming included baseball games from Athletic Park and piano recitals from the mezzanine of the Hotel Belmont.Victoria Daily Colonist, Wed. August 18, 1926, page 7 By October 1926, the station was broadcasting sponsored programmes for the Hudson's Bay Company. It was on the air daily except Wednesday, from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. Other advertisers included the Kelly- Douglas Company, Dominion Battery Company, Canadian National Carbon Company and Moorite Products of Canada. H.W. Paulson was the announcer and R. Burgess the sales representative. The station transmitted through an 80-foot-high aerial on 411 metres at 10 watts.Vancouver Sun, October 21, 1926, Page 14 The station's final broadcast from Nanaimo appears to have been a special programme on April 1, 1927, which was claimed at the time of having established a world record for the furthest distance of a transmission over a submarine telephone cable. Holstead asked Nanaimo City Council to bear part of the $125 cost of any similar broadcasts because of the publicity to the city.Nanaimo Daily News, Tuesday, April 12, 1927, Page 1 CKWX The station first used the call letters CKWX on August 1, 1927, in conjunction with the opening of its new studios.Vancouver Sun, July 30, 1927, pg. 17 The official opening wasn't until August 19, and was marked by a four-hour all- star programme, including the band of the H. M. S. Colombo. Other local stations remained off the air as a courtesy.Vancouver Sun, Friday, August 19, 1927, Page 22 The station was operating from the Hotel Georgia, 801 West Georgia Street, and sharing air time at 411 metres (730 kilocycles) with CFCQ and CKCD, then with CHLS, CKFC and CKMO in 1929. The station was permitted to use a special wave-length of 340.7 metres for a speech by M.P. Henri Bourassa for one occasion in 1927.Vancouver Sun, October 17, 1927, Page 7 Harold William Paulson, who had been a storage battery engineer in the U.S. before coming to British Columbia, left CKWX by 1933 and eventually became commercial manager at the CBC Vancouver. In 1933, CKWX moved to 1010 kHz, then to 950 in 1938. It moved to 980 kHz in 1941 following the North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), which took effect on March 27 that year to settle problems with AM radio interference. Arthur Halstead later sold a 40% share of the station to Taylor, Pearson & Carson, which took over station management, moved the studios to Seymour Street and increased its transmitting power to 1,000 watts. By 1947, CKWX's power further increased to 5,000 watts and it became a network affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System, while its transmitter was moved to Lulu Island (now part of Richmond). Move to 1130 CKWX went to 24-hour operation on January 1, 1954, at 12:30 a.m., with a program called \\"Concert Under the Stars.\\" In 1956, the studios moved to 1275 Burrard Street, and on August 15, 1957, CKWX switched from 980 kHz (soon taken by CKNW) to its present 1130 kHz. The station adopted a Top 40 music format in the same year when Red Robinson joined the station's on-air staff. CKWX was, in fact, the first Vancouver radio station to use the all-hit format full- time. In 1958, CKWX became the first non-CBC station in Western Canada to operate with 50,000 watts. Harold Carson, one-third of the Taylor, Pearson & Carson firm that owned CKWX, died in 1959. The firm changed its name to Selkirk Holdings Ltd. later in the year. CKWX switched formats from Top 40 to Middle of The Road (MOR) music with some talk shows in 1962, and Red Robinson left the station at that time to join CFUN. Selkirk became a publicly traded company in 1965, and it purchased 100% ownership of CKWX (with approval from the Board of Broadcast Governors) on October 10, 1966. Country era On March 7, 1973, CKWX underwent a major change as it dropped its mix of MOR music and talk and switched to country music, keeping that format for the next 23 years. On February 13, 1979, the CRTC granted CKWX parent Selkirk Holdings a license for an FM station with a jazz format. Selkirk originally wanted 93.7 MHz, but were advised to find a different frequency. CJAZ would sign on at 92.1 MHz on March 1, 1980, as the first Canadian station playing all jazz. CJAZ later moved to 96.9, then switched call letters and formats in 1985 as it became CKKS, playing adult contemporary music. The 92.1 frequency is now used by CBU-FM-1 in Victoria.FCCdata.com/CBU-FM-1 CKWX and CKKS moved to new studios on 2440 Ash Street on June 17, 1988, with the official opening on July 20. On September 28, 1988, Maclean-Hunter Ltd. purchased Selkirk Communications and its stations (including CKWX and CKKS) and also received approval from the CRTC to transfer the former Selkirk stations to Rogers Communications Inc.. All-news On February 8, 1996, at 8 a.m., after playing \\"For the Good Times\\" by Ray Price, CKWX ended its country music format after almost 23 years and switched to its present all-news format. Tom Mark was the first announcer under the new format. Other anchors when the station went on the air were Brian Decker, Dianne Newman, Kevin Rothwell, Andrea Ring, Terri Theodore and Jack Marion, who was also the morning newsman at CKKS. Field reporters included Jim Goddard and Treena Wood, with Garry Raible as sports director, Russell Byth and Herb Hamm as the business editors, and Bruce Williams and Kim Larsson reporting on traffic. Brian Brenn, Ted Schellenberg and Eric Westra joined the station within the first year as anchors, shortly followed by Jim Bennie and veteran Andy Walsh. In 2003, CKKS switched formats again and became CKLG-FM, playing adult hits under the Jack FM banner. A fairly extensive personnel shuffle took place at CKWX on September 2, 2003. Program Director George Gordon replaced Andrew Dawson as morning co-anchor, joining Kenya Anderson, while Dianne Newman moved to the midday slot joining Brian Brenn. That same day, Jim Bennie joined Joanna Mileos to co-anchor the p.m. drive. In 2006, Don Lehn would rotate in middays with Brian Brenn and Andy Walsh until 2010. Pamela McCall became the newest afternoon anchor, replacing Joanna Mileos, in the Spring of 2007. McCall would later leave the station and be replaced by Karen Thomson in 2008. Following the departure of Kenya Anderson in 2005, Treena Wood and Tammy Moyer alternated in the anchor chair only to be replaced by Dianne Newman in 2006. Ben Wilson was named permanent evening anchor with Tom Bricker in November 2007. That same month, Brian Brenn took early retirement and was replaced in the midday anchor chair by Reaon Ford. George Gordon was terminated July 15, 2009. Reaon Ford was promoted from midday anchor to morning anchor in August 2009. As of 2020, the host line-up is John Ackermann and Amanda Wawryk (mornings), Tim James and Alison Bailey (middays), Jim Bennie and Ria Renouf (afternoons), and Ben Wilson and Bailey Nicholson (evenings).

The shortwave service had been in operation since 1929 and had been inherited from CKFC. The shortwave outlet was intended to serve coastal communities that had no existing AM service, in particular Queen Charlotte Islands and upper Vancouver Island. A 10-watt transmitter (output power) and new antenna sent the CKFX signal in a north westerly direction. CKFX operated in the 49-metre band at 6.08 MHz.

From the early 1980s he built up a collection of carefully selected mares, in the early days buying from Robert Sangster. By 2011 these represented, according to Lord Grimthorpe in an interview given to the Financial Times, \\"one of the greatest brood-mare bands in the history of breeding\\". The British arm of the Juddmonte operations came to include Estcourt Estate in Gloucestershire, as well as Juddmonte Dullingham, Side Hill Stud and Banstead Manor Stud in Newmarket in Suffolk. There, Prince Khalid stood a number of leading stallions, notably Dansili, Oasis Dream, Frankel and Kingman. Juddmonte also owns Ferrans Stud and New Abbey Stud in Ireland, as well as Juddmonte Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. The Juddmonte Group's CEO is Douglas Erskine Crum. The studs in England are managed by Simon Mockridge, in Ireland by Barry Mahon and in the US by Garrett O'Rourke. Teddy Grimthorpe is Racing Manager. Prince Khalid was responsible for the allocation of horses to trainers and for approval of mating lists. In a rare interview in 2010 he told The Racing Post: \\"When I was at the sales I realised that it would be easier to buy horses and race them, but I got the feeling that this was not enough, that it would be more fun to do what people like the Aga Khan and Lord Howard de Walden did and build up your own families.\\" He said that he had his stud book with him all the time. In 2017, the Juddmonte operation employed around 250 people and extended to 700-800 horses around the world, with a racing stock of about 250.

According to the USGS a variant name is Choan River. Flowing for approximately 50 miles (80 km) before ending in the Albemarle Sound on North Carolina's coast, the river drains about of land in North Carolina and Virginia. Flowing through mostly swamp land with occasional high ground, the Chowan River grows to nearly two miles wide (3 km) at its opening to the Albemarle Sound. The river offers excellent fishing for catfish and largemouth bass. While tidal, the variation in tide heights in the Chowan River are normally less than one foot (30 cm) between high and low tide. The average depth is 16 feet and the maximum depth is 40 feet around Holiday Island. The Eden House bridge on US Route 17 marks the border between the Chowan River and Albemarle Sound. Significant tributaries include Bonds Creek, the Meherrin River, Bennett's Creek (which connects the Chowan River with Merchant's Millpond State Park), and the Wiccacon River. The river featured prominently in the Civil War in the region. As part of the Union plan to destroy the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, Union ships sailed up the Chowan river, bombarding small Confederate posts outside of Harrellsville, North Carolina (at Deep Creek, also known as Swain's Mill Creek) and outside of Cofield, North Carolina (at Petty's Shore, where an old bunker is still visible in the landscape). By the time the ships reached Winton, North Carolina, the local troops had been alerted to the oncoming ships. Hiding in the woods near the dock for an ambush, the Confederate battalion at Winton sent a slave girl down to the Union boats to tell them that the locals had fled in fear of a Union attack. The ambush was foiled, however, when a Union soldier saw the gleam of the sun on a musket barrel in the woods. The Union ships quickly pulled anchor, regrouped, and returned minutes later to burn Winton to the ground. That same Union fleet would go on to land at Murfreesboro, North Carolina (via the Meherrin River) and march west to the railroad at Weldon. The Chowan River is one of the three oldest surviving English place-names in the U.S. Along with Roanoke Island and the Neuse River, it was named in 1584 by Captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe, sent to explore the region by Sir Walter Raleigh.

It began as a segment which ran every in 20 minute intervals during Cold Pizza, a two-hour program broadcast on the American cable television network ESPN2, each weekday morning. It first aired at 7 AM, then moved to 8 before settling in at 10:00 AM and noon ET and later became a standalone program on ESPN2 at 2:30 PM each afternoon. Brian Donlon was the original executive producer of both Cold Pizza and 1st & 10.http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/slicing-spinoff/370972 History The program is hosted by Jay Crawford and features a sports columnist Skip Bayless. Woody Paige, another columnist, was a founding co-host, but left the show before the move to Connecticut to return to his writing duties at the Denver Post. Dana Jacobson, First Take co-host, takes over the segments (and the spin-off show) when Crawford is away. Guest hosts, in place of either Jacobson or Crawford, have included Josh Elliott, Tom Rinaldi, Michael Kim, Michelle Bonner, Sage Steele and Bayless himself. (On the show Bayless hosted, the brothers who make up the 2 Live Stews, Doug and Ryan Stewart, were on either side of him.) On May 7, 2007, the program moved to ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut from its previous location in New York City. There have been occasional on-location segments as well. During the show or segment, Bayless and another panelist discuss and debate ten items of significant sports news daily, with the full program ultimately divided into four segments, termed, as in American football, whence comes also the program's title, downs. Viewer e-mail is often read at the beginning of each segment and incorporated into discussion. Crawford joined ESPN as co-host of Cold Pizza in 2003 having previously served as director of sports programming at WFTS-TV in Tampa, Florida. Paige, having frequently been a panelist on ESPN's Around the Horn while on the staff of the Denver Post, for which he had worked for more than thirty years, left the Post in 2004 to become a full-time employee of ESPN; however, he left the show on November 28, 2006 to return to the Post. Bayless, formerly a columnist for the Dallas Morning News, Miami Herald, and San Jose Mercury News, also left print journalism to join ESPN in 2004. Since Paige left the show in December 2006 to return to Denver, Colorado, Bayless has been joined by a different guest panelist, whose run on the show has usually lasted for a week. The change affects both the main and spin-off programs. When the move to Bristol was originally announced, Bayless was no longer to be a regular on the show. Instead, he was to be part of a rotating group that will also include Patrick McEnroe, Stephen A. Smith, and Jemele Hill. However, Bayless has continued to be on the show every day since the move (except for vacation periods), and the basic format has not changed. On August 11, 2008, the show moved to ESPN2 because ESPN unveiled its new live SportsCenter block in the mid-morning and afternoon. In August 2011, parent show First Take underwent a drastic format change. Gone were the 1st and 10 segments, replaced with a more pronounced role for Skip Bayless. The show greatly increased the amount of debate segments, dropping the 1st and 10 name altogether and using the First Take name throughout. In August 2011, ESPN rolled out a 1st and 10 podcast, featuring all of the debate topics condensed into a downloadable audio file. On September 13, 2011, the podcast was renamed the First Take podcast, effectively rendering 1st and 10 defunct. Comparisons to other ESPN talk shows The show was similar in format to ESPN's other afternoon sports talk programs Jim Rome Is Burning, Around the Horn, and Pardon the Interruption. What made the show different from others was its use of two panelists who talk about topics without any scoring system (as on Horn) or set amount of time given to a topic (PTI). Also, there are no \\"theme\\" segments or interviews with athletes and celebrities (several of the other shows), nor do either of the panelists face \\"elimination\\" at the end of a segment (also a feature of Horn).

They are not to be confused with the liturgical rite of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church (a variant of the East Syriac Rite), for which see Syro- Malabar rite. The missions concerned are not those of the coast of southwestern India, to which the name Malabar coast properly belongs, but rather those of nearby inner South India, especially those of the former Hindu \\"kingdoms\\" of Madurai, Mysore and the Carnatic.  Origins  The question of Malabar Rites originated in the method followed by the Jesuit mission, since the beginning of the seventeenth century, in evangelizing those countries. The prominent feature of that method was an accommodation to the manners and customs of the people to be converted. Enemies of the Jesuits claim that, in Madura, Mysore and the Karnatic, the Jesuits either accepted for themselves or permitted to their neophytes such practices as they knew to be idolatrous or superstitious. Others reject the claim as unjust and absurd and say that the claim is tantamount to asserting that these men, whose intelligence, at least, was never questioned, were so stupid as to jeopardize their own salvation to save others and to endure infinite hardships to establish among the Hindus a corrupt and sham Christianity. The popes, while disapproving of some usages hitherto considered inoffensive or tolerable by the missionaries, never charged them with having knowingly adulterated the purity of religion. One of them, who had observed the \\"Malabar Rites\\" for seventeen years previous to his martyrdom, was conferred by the Church the honour of beatification. The process for the beatification of Father John de Britto was going on at Rome during the hottest period of the controversy over these \\"Rites\\", and the adversaries of the Jesuits asserted that beatification to be impossible because it would amount to approving the \\"superstitions and idolatries\\" maintained by the missioners of Madura. Still, the cause progressed, and Benedict XIV, on 2 July 1741, declared \\"that the rites in question had not been used, as among the Gentiles, with religious significance, but merely as civil observances, and that therefore they were no obstacle to bringing forward the process\\".Brief of Beatification of John de Britto, 18 May 1852 The mere enumeration of the Decrees by which the question was decided shows how perplexing it was and how difficult the solution. It was concluded that there was no reason to view the \\"Malabar rites\\", as practised generally in those missions, in any other light and that the good faith of the missionaries in tolerating the native customs should not be contested; but on the other hand, they erred in carrying this toleration too far. Father de Nobili's work  The founder of the missions of the interior of South India, Roberto de Nobili, was born in Rome, in 1577, of a noble family from Montepulciano, which numbered among many distinguished relatives the celebrated Cardinal Roberto Bellarmine. When nineteen years of age, he entered the Society of Jesus. After a few years, he requested his superiors to send him to the missions of India. He embarked at Lisbon, 1604, and in 1606 was serving his apostolic apprenticeship in South India, where Christianity was then flourishing on the coasts. It is well known that St Francis Xavier baptized many thousands there, and from the apex of the Indian triangle the faith spread along both sides, especially on the west, the Malabar coast. But the interior of the vast peninsula remained almost untouched. The Apostle of the Indies himself recognized the insuperable opposition of the \\"Brahmins and other noble castes inhabiting the interior\\" to the preaching of the Gospel.Monumenta Xaveriana, I, 54 Yet his disciples were not sparing of endeavours. A Portuguese Jesuit, Gonsalvo Fernandes, had resided in the city of Madura fully fourteen years, having obtained leave of the king to stay there to watch over the spiritual needs of a few Christians from the coast; and, though a zealous and pious missionary, he had not succeeded, within that long space of time, in making one convert. This painful state of things Nobili witnessed in 1606, when together with his superior, the Provincial of Malabar, he paid a visit to Fernandes. At once his keen eye perceived the cause and the remedy. It was evident that a deep-rooted aversion to the foreign preachers hindered the Hindus of the interior, not only from accepting the Gospel, but even from listening to its message. The aversion was not to the foreigner, but the Prangui. This name, with which the natives of India designed the Portuguese, conveyed to their minds the idea of an infamous and abject class of men, with whom no Hindu could have any intercourse without degrading himself to the lowest ranks of the population. Now the Prangui were abominated because they violated the most respected customs of India, by eating beef, and indulging in wine and spirits; but much as all well-bred Hindus abhorred those things, they felt more disgusted at seeing the Portuguese, irrespective of any distinction of caste, treat freely with the lowest classes, such as the pariahs, who in the eyes of their countrymen of the higher castes, are nothing better than the vilest animals. Accordingly, since Fernandes was known to be a Portuguese, that is a Prangui, and besides was seen living habitually with the men of the lowest caste, the religion he preached, no less than himself, had to share the contempt and execration attending his neophytes, and made no progress whatever among the better classes. To become acceptable to all, Christianity must be presented to all, Christianity must be presented in quite another way. While Nobili thought over his plan, probably the example just set by his countryman Matteo Ricci, in China, stood before his mind. At all events, he started from the same principle, resolving to become, after the motto of St Paul, all things to all men, and a Hindu to the Hindus, as far as might be lawful. Having ripened his design by thorough meditation and by conferring with his superiors, the Archbishop of Cranganore and the provincial of Malabar, who both approved and encouraged his resolution, Nobili began his career by re- entering Madura in the dress of the saniassy (Hindu ascetics). He never tried to make believe that he was a native of India; else he would have deserved the name of impostor; with which he has sometimes been unjustedly branded; but he availed himself of the fact that he was not a Portuguese, to deprecate the opprobrious name Prangui. He introduced himself as a Roman raja (prince), desirous of living at Madura in practising penance, in praying and studying the sacred law. He carefully avoided meeting with Father Fernandes and took his lodging in a solitary abode in the Brahmins' quarter obtained from the benevolence of a high officer. At first he called himself a raja, but soon he changed this title for that of brahmin (Hindu priest), better suited to his aims: the rajas and other kshatryas, the second of the three high castes, formed the military class; but intellectual avocations were almost monopolized by the Brahmins. They held from time immemorial the spiritual if not the political government of the nation, and were the arbiters of what the others ought to believe, to revere, and to adore. Yet they were in no wise a priestly caste; they were possessed of no exclusive right to perform functions of a religious nature. Nobili remained for a long time shut up in his dwelling, after the custom of Indian penitents, living on rice, milk, and herbs with water. Once a day he received attendance but only from Brahmin servants. Curiosity could not fail to be raised, and all the more as the foreign saniassy was very slow in satisfying it. When, after two or three refusals, he admitted visitors, the interview was conducted according to the strictest rules of Hindu etiquette. Nobili charmed his audience by the perfection with which he spoke their own language, Tamil; by the quotations of famous Indian authors with which he interspersed his discourse, and above all, by the fragments of native poetry which he recited or even sang with exquisite skill. Having thus won a benevolent hearing, he proceeded step by step on his missionary task, labouring first to set right the ideas of his auditors with respect to natural truth concerning God, the soul, etc., and then instilling by degrees the dogmas of the Christian faith. He took advantage also of his acquaintance with the books revered by the Hindus as sacred and divine. These he contrived, the first of all Europeans, to read and study in the Sanskrit originals. For this purpose he had engaged a reputed Brahmin teacher, with whose assistance and by the industry of his own keen intellect and felicitous memory he gained such a knowledge of this recondite literature as to strike the native doctors with amazement, very few of them feeling themselves capable of vying with him on the point. In this way also he was enabled to find in the Vedas many truths which he used in testimony of the doctrine he preached. By this method, and no less by the prestige of his pure and austere life, the missionary had soon dispelled the distrust. Before the end of 1608, he conferred baptism on several persons conspicuous for nobility and learning. While he obliged his neophytes to reject all practices involving superstition or savouring in any wise of idolatrous worship, he allowed them to keep their national customs, in as far as these contained nothing wrong and referred to merely political or civil usages. Accordingly, Nobili's disciples continued for example, wearing the dress proper to each one's caste; the Brahmins retaining their codhumbi (tuft of hair) and cord (cotton string slung over the left shoulder); all adorning as before, their foreheads with sandalwood paste, etc. yet, one condition was laid on them, namely, that the cord and sandal, if once taken with any superstitious ceremony, be removed and replaced by others with a special benediction, the formula of which had been sent to Nobili by the Archbishop of Cranganore. While the missionary was winning more and more esteem, not only for himself, but also for the Gospel, even among those who did not receive it, the fanatical ministers and votaries of the national gods, whom he was going to supplant, could not watch his progress quietly. By their assaults, indeed, his work was almost unceasingly impeded, and barely escaped ruin on several occasions; but he held his ground in spite of calumny, imprisonment, menaces of death and all kinds of ill-treatment. In April, 1609, the flock which he had gathered around him was too numerous for his chapel and required a church; and the labour of the ministry had become so crushing that he entreated the provincial to send him a companion. At that point a storm fell on him from an unexpected place. Fernandes, the missioner already mentioned, may have felt no mean jealousy, when seeing Nobili succeed so happily where he had been so powerless; but certainly he proved unable to understand or to appreciate the method of his colleague; probably, also, as he had lived perforce apart from the circles among which the latter was working, he was never well informed of his doings. However, that may be, Fernandes directed to the superiors of the Jesuits in India and at Rome a lengthy report, in which he charged Nobili with simulation, in declining the name of Prangui; with connivance at idolatry, in allowing his neophytes to observe customs, such as wearing the insignia of castes; lastly, with schismatical proceeding, in dividing the Christians into separate congregations. This denunciation at first caused an impression highly unfavourable to Nobili. Influenced by the account of Fernandes, the provincial of Malabar (Father Laerzio, who had always countenanced Nobili, had then left that office), the Visitor of the India Missions and even the General of the Society at Rome sent severe warnings to the missionary innovator. Cardinal Bellarmine, in 1612, wrote to his relative, expressing the grief he felt on hearing of his unwise conduct. Things changed as soon as Nobili, being informed of the accusation, could answer it on every point. By oral explanations, in the assemblies of missionaries and theologians at Cochin and at Goa, and by an elaborate memoir, which he sent to Rome, he justified the manner in which he had presented himself to the Brahmins of Madura. He then showed that the national customs he allowed his converts to keep were such as had no religious meaning. The latter point, the crux of the question, he elucidated by numerous quotations from the authoritative Sanskrit law-books of the Hindus. Moreover, he procured affidavits of one hundred and eight Brahmins, from among the most learned in Madura, all endorsing his interpretation of the native practices. He acknowledged that the infidels used to associate those practices with superstitious ceremonies; but, he observed, > \\"these ceremonies belong to the mode, not to the substance of the practices; > the same difficulty may be raised about eating, drinking, marriage, etc., > for the heathens mix their ceremonies with all their actions. It suffices to > do away with the superstitious ceremonies, as the Christians do\\". As to schism, he denied having caused any such thing: > \\"he had founded a new Christianity, which never could have been brought > together with the older: the separation of the churches had been approved by > the Archbishop of Cranganore; and it precluded neither unity of faith nor > Christian charity, for his neophytes used to greet kindly those of F. > Fernandes. Even on the coast there are different churches for different > castes, and in Europe the places in the churches are not common for all.\\" Nobili's apology was effectually seconded by the Archbishop of Cranganore, who, as he had encouraged the first steps of the missionary, continued to stand firmly by his side, and pleaded his cause warmly at Goa before the archbishop, as well as at Rome. Thus the learned and zealous primate of India, Alexis de Menezes, though a synod held by him had prohibited the Brahmin cord, was won over to the cause of Nobili. His successor, Christopher de Sa, remained almost the only opponent in India. At Rome the explanations of Nobili, of the Archbishop of Cranganore, and of the chief Inquisitor of Goa brought about a similar effect. In 1614 and 1615 Cardinal Bellarmine and the General of the Jesuit Society wrote again to the missionary, declaring themselves fully satisfied. At last, after the usual examination by the Holy See, on 31 January 1623, Gregory XV, by his Apostolic Letter \\"Romanae Sedis Antistes\\", decided the question provisionally in favour of Father de Nobili. Accordingly, the codhumbi, the cord, the sandal, and the baths were permitted to the Indian Christians, \\"until the Holy See provide otherwise\\"; only certain conditions are prescribed, in order that all superstitious admixture and all occasion of scandal may be averted. As to the separation of the castes, the pope confines himself to \\"earnestly entreating and beseeching (etiam atque etiam obtestamur et obsecramus) the nobles not to despise the lower people, especially in the churches, by hearing the Divine word and receiving the sacraments apart from them. Indeed, a strict order to this effect would have been tantamount to sentencing the new-born Christianity of Madura to death. The pope understood, no doubt, that the customs connected with the distinction of castes, being so deeply rooted in the ideas and habits of all Hindus, did not admit an abrupt suppression, even among the Christians. They were to be dealt with by the Church, as had been slavery, serfdom, and the like institutions of past times. The Church never attacked directly those inveterate customs; but she inculcated meekness, humility, charity, love of the Saviour who suffered and gave His life for all, and by this method slavery, serfdom, and other social abuses were slowly eradicated. While imitating this wise indulgence to the feebleness of new converts, Father de Nobili took much care to inspire his disciples with the feelings becoming true Christians towards their humbler brethren. At the very outset of his preaching, he insisted on making all understand that > \\"religion was by no means dependent on caste; indeed it must be one for all, > the true God being one for all; although [he added] unity of religion > destroys not the civil distinction of the castes nor the lawful privileges > of the nobles\\". Explaining then the commandment of charity, he inculcated that it extended to the pariahs as well as others, and he exempted nobody from the duties it imposes; but he might rightly tell his neophytes that, for example, visiting pariahs or other of low caste at their houses, treating them familiarly, even kneeling or sitting by them in the church, concerned perfection rather than the precept of charity, and that accordingly such actions could be omitted without any fault, at least where they involved so grave a detriment as degradation from the higher caste. Of this principle the missionaries had a right to make use for themselves. Indeed, charity required more from the pastors of souls than from others; yet not in such a way that they should endanger the salvation of the many to relieve the needs of the few. Therefore, Nobili, at the beginning of his apostolate, avoided all public intercourse with the lower castes; but he failed not to minister secretly even to pariahs. In the year 1638, there were at Tiruchirapalli (Trichinopoly) several hundred Christian pariahs, who had been secretly taught and baptized by the companions of Nobili. About this time he devised a means of assisting more directly the lower castes, without ruining the work begun among the higher. Besides the Brahmin saniassy, there was another grade of Hindu ascetics, called pandaram, enjoying less consideration than the Brahmins, but who were allowed to deal publicly with all castes. They were not excluded from relations with the higher castes. On the advice of Nobili, the superiors of the mission with the Archbishop of Cranganore resolved that henceforward there should be two classes of missionaries, the Brahmin and the pandaram. Father Balthasar da Costa was the first, in 1540, who took the name and habit of pandaram, under which he effected a large number of conversions, of others as well as of pariahs. Nobili had then three Jesuit companions. After the comforting decision of Rome, he had hastened to extend his preaching beyond the town of Madura, and the Gospel spread by degrees over the whole interior of South India. In 1646, exhausted by forty-two years of toiling and suffering, he was constrained to retire, first to Jafnapatam in Ceylon, then to Mylapore, where he died 16 January 1656. He left his mission in full progress. To give some idea of its development, note that the superiors, writing to the General of the Society, about the middle and during the second half of the seventeenth century, record an annual average of five thousand conversions, the number never being less than three thousand a year even when the missioners' work was most hindered by persecution. At the end of the seventeenth century, the total number of Christians in the mission, founded by Nobili and still named Madura mission, though embracing, besides Madura, Mysore, Marava, Tanjore, Gingi, etc., is described as exceeding 150,000. Yet the number of the missionaries never went beyond seven, assisted however by many native catechists. The Madura mission belonged to the Portuguese assistance of the Society of Jesus, but it was supplied with men from all provinces of the Order. Thus, for example, Father Beschi (c. 1710-1746), who won respect from the Hindus, heathen and Christian, for his writings in Tamil, was an Italian, as the founder of the mission had been. In the last quarter of the seventeenth century, the French Father John Venantius Bouchet worked for twelve years in Madura, chiefly at Trichinopoly, during which time he baptized about 20,000 infidels. The catechumens, in these parts of India, were admitted to baptism only after a long and a careful preparation. Indeed, the missionary accounts of the time bear frequent witness to the very commendable qualities of these Christians, their fervent piety, their steadfastness in the sufferings they often had to endure for religion's sake, their charity towards their brethren, even of lowest castes, their zeal for the conversion of pagans. In the year 1700 Father Bouchet, with a few other French Jesuits, opened a new mission in the Karnatic, north of the River Kaveri. Like their Portuguese colleagues of Madura, the French missionaries of the Karnatic were very successful, in spite of repeated and almost continual persecutions by the idolaters. Moreover, several of them became particularly conspicuous for the extensive knowledge they acquired of the literature and sciences of ancient India. From Father Coeurdoux the French Academicians learned the common origin of the Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin languages; to the initiative of Nobili and to the endeavours of his followers in the same line is due the first disclosure of a new intellectual world in India. The first original documents, enabling the learned to explore that world, were drawn from their hiding-places in India, and sent in large numbers to Europe by the same missionaries. But the Karnatic mission had hardly begun when it was disturbed by the revival of the controversy, which the decision of Gregory XV had set at rest for three quarters of a century. The Decree of Tournon  This second phase, which was much more eventful and noisy than the first, originated in Pondicherry. Since the French had settled at that place, the spiritual care of the colonists was in the hands of the Capuchin Fathers, who were also working for the conversion of the natives. With a view to forwarding the latter work, the Bishop of Mylapore or San Thome, to whose jurisdiction Pondicherry belonged, resolved, in 1699, to transfer it entirely to the Jesuits of the Karnatic mission, assigning to them a parochial church in the town and restricting the ministry of the Capuchins to the European immigrants, French or Portuguese. The Capuchins were displeased by this arrangement and appealed to Rome. The petition they laid before the Pope, in 1703, embodied not only a complaint against the division of parishes made by the Bishop, but also an accusation against the methods of the Jesuit mission in South India. Their claim on the former point was finally dismissed, but the charges were more successful. On 6 November 1703, Charles-Thomas Maillard de Tournon, a Piedmontese prelate, Patriarch of Antioch, sent by Clement XI, with the power of legatus a latere, to visit the new Christian missions of the East Indies and especially China, landed at Pondicherry. Being obliged to wait there eight months for the opportunity of passing over to China, Tournon instituted an inquiry into the facts alleged by the Capuchins. He was hindered through sickness, as he himself stated, from visiting any part of the inland mission; in the town, besides the Capuchins, who had not visited the interior, he interrogated a few natives through interpreters; the Jesuits he consulted rather cursorily, it seems. Less than eight months after his arrival in India, he considered himself justified in issuing a decree of vital import to the whole of the Christians of India. It consisted of sixteen articles concerning practices in use or supposed to be in use among the neophytes of Madura and the Karnatic; the legate condemned and prohibited these practices as defiling the purity of the faith and religion, and forbade the missionaries, on pain of heavy censures, to permit them any more. Though dated 23 June 1704, the decree was notified to the superiors of the Jesuits only on 8 July, three days before the departure of Tournon from Pondicherry. During the short time left, the missionaries endeavoured to make him understand on what imperfect information his degree rested, and that nothing less than the ruin of the mission was likely to follow from its execution. They succeeded in persuading him to take off orally the threat of censures appended, and to suspend provisionally the prescription commanding the missionaries to give spiritual assistance to the sick pariahs, not only in the churches, but in their dwellings. Examination of the Malabar Rites at Rome Tournon's decree, interpreted by prejudice and ignorance as representing, in the wrong practices if condemned, the real state of the India missions, affords to this day a much-used weapon against the Jesuits. At Rome it was received with reserve. Clement XI, who perhaps overrated the prudence of his zealous legate, ordered, in the Congregation of the Holy Office, on 7 January 1706, a provisional confirmation of the decree to be sent to him, adding that it should be executed \\"until the Holy See might provide otherwise, after having heard those who might have something to object\\". And meanwhile, by an oraculum vivae vocis granted to the procurator of the Madura mission, the pope decree, \\"in so far as the Divine glory and the salvation of souls would permit\\". The objections of the missionaries and the corrections they desired were propounded by several deputies and carefully examined at Rome, without effect, during the lifetime of Clement XI and during the short pontificate of his successor Innocent XIII. Benedict XIII grappled with the case and even came to a decision, enjoining \\"on the bishops and missionaries of Madura, Mysore, and the Karnatic \\" the execution of Tournon's decree in all its parts (12 December 1727). Yet it is doubted whether that decision ever reached the mission, and Clement XII, who succeeded Benedict XIII, commanded the whole affair to be discussed anew. In four meetings held from 21 January to 6 September 1733, the cardinals of the Holy Office gave their final conclusions upon all the articles of Tournon's decree, declaring how each of them ought to be executed, or restricted and mitigated. By a Brief dated 24 August 1734, pope Clement XII sanctioned this resolution; moreover, on 13 May 1739, he prescribed an oath, by which every missionary should bind himself to obeying and making the neophytes obey exactly the Brief of 24 August 1734. Many hard prescriptions of Tournon were mitigated by the regulation of 1734. As to the first article, condemning the omission of the use of saliva and breathing on the candidates for baptism, the missionaries, and the bishops of India with them, are rebuked for not having consulted the Holy See previously to that omission; yet, they are allowed to continue for ten years omitting these ceremonies, to which the Hindus felt so strangely loath. Other prohibitions or precepts of the legate are softened by the additions of a Quantum fieri potest, or even replaced by mere counsels or advices. In the sixth article, the taly, \\"with the image of the idol Pulleyar\\", is still interdicted, but the Congregation observes that \\"the missionaries say they never permitted wearing of such a taly\\". Now this observation seems pretty near to recognizing that possibly the prohibitions of the rather overzealous legate did not always hit upon existing abuses. And a similar conclusion might be drawn from several other articles, e.g. from the fifteenth, where we are told that the interdiction of wearing ashes and emblems after the manner of the heathen Hindus, ought to be kept, but in such a manner, it is added, \\"that the Constitution of Gregory XV of 31 January 1623, Romanae Senis Antistes, be observed throughout\\". By that Constitution, as we have already seen, some signs and ornaments, materially similar to those prohibited by Tournon, were allowed to the Christians, provided that no superstition whatever was mingled with their use. Indeed, as the Congregation of Propaganda explains in an Instruction sent to the Vicar Apostolic of Pondicherry, 15 February 1792, \\"the Decree of Cardinal de Tournon and the Constitution of Gregory XV agree in this way, that both absolutely forbid any sign bearing even the least semblance of superstition, but allow those which are in general use for the sake of adornment, of good manners, and bodily cleanness, without any respect to religion\\". The most difficult point retained was the twelfth article, commanding the missionaries to administer the sacraments to the sick pariahs in their dwellings, publicly. Though submitting dutifully to all precepts of the Vicar of Christ, the Jesuits in Madura could not but feel distressed, at experiencing how the last especially, made their apostolate difficult and even impossible amidst the upper classes of Hindus. At their request, Benedict XIV consented to try a new solution of the knotty problem, by forming a band of missionaries who should attend only to the care of the pariahs. This scheme became formal law through the Constitution \\"Omnium sollicitudinum\\", published 12 September 1744. Except this point, the document confirmed again the whole regulation enacted by Clement XII in 1734. The arrangement sanctioned by Benedict XIV benefited greatly the lower classes of Hindu neophytes; whether it worked also to the advantage of the mission at large, is another question, about which the reports are less comforting. Be that as it may, after the suppression of the Society of Jesus (1773), the distinction between Brahmin and pariah missionaries became extinct with the Jesuit missionaries. Henceforth conversions in the higher castes were fewer and fewer, and nowadays the Christian Hindus, for the most part, belong to the lower and lowest classes. The Jesuit missionaries, when re-entering Madura in the 1838, did not come with the dress of the Brahmin saniassy, like the founders of the mission; yet they pursued a design which Nobili had also in view, though he could not carry it out, as they opened their college of Negapatam, now at Trichinopoly. A wide breach has already been made into the wall of Brahminic reserve by that institution, where hundreds of Brahmins send their sons to be taught by the Catholic missionaries. Within recent years, about fifty of these young men have embraced the faith of their teachers, at the cost of rejection from their caste and even from their family; such examples are not lost on their countrymen, either of high or low caste.

Recording and production Recording sessions for what would become Flow Motion began at Can's Inner Space Studio in Cologne in the spring of 1976. Since their latest album, the band had been recording on a state of the art 16-track machine, which had changed the dynamics of the group and the way they recorded. Instead of playing everything live together, different members could now record their parts separately. This, and their embracing of rhythms (especially disco) on Flow Motion that were unpopular with rock music fans, is probably why the album was not as well received by fans and critics when it first appeared. Flow Motion was mixed using \\"Artificial Head\\" binaural stereo. The cover features a photograph taken by band member Michael Karoli. Music Throughout their career, Can had always experimented with a number of different rhythms. With Flow Motion, the band became more playful, adding disco and reggae to this list. Apart from the new rhythms, the influence of recording with 16 tracks meant there are multiple guitar lines from Michael Karoli, and Irmin Schmidt's keyboards also come to the fore, providing much of the shimmering and shiny atmosphere that is found throughout the album. A disco vibe dominates the opening track \\"I Want More\\", which is short, catchy and danceable. The song was released as a single and became a hit, reaching number 26 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1976.EveryHit.com The band even appeared on Top of the Pops to perform the song. Reggae infuses most of the rest of the album, although Can experiments with rhythm and instrumentation, rather than playing it straight. This is exemplified on \\"Cascade Waltz\\", which combines a reggae beat with a waltz, and on \\"Laugh Till You Cry, Live Till You Die\\", which features guitarist Karoli playing the Turkic baƒülama. After the reprise of the opening track \\"...And More\\", which finished side one of the original vinyl album, Can opens side two with \\"Babylonian Pearl\\", which evocative of Can's \\"Come Sta, La Luna\\" on Soon Over Babaluma. The song's vocals are handled by Irmin Schmidt, and speak about a girl who \\"comes from a land where woman is man\\". This, and all of the other lyrics on this album, were written by Peter Gilmour, the band's live sound engineer. The next song, the gloomy-sounding \\"Smoke (E.F.S. Nr. 59)\\", is more experimental, with Jaki Liebezeit's intense ethnic tom-tom beat driving the song forward. Another experimental track, the lengthy and unrestrained \\"Flow Motion\\", closes the album. Reception and influence The more accessible nature of Flow Motion, and its flirtation with disco, meant this album was not well received at the time of its release. Fans couldn't have enjoyed seeing the band playing disco, lip-synching and dancing to Top of the Pops, especially as rock fans generally hated disco in the 1970s. Many fans felt that Can had abandoned its experimentation and innovation, with artists such as Brian Eno and David Bowie, being influenced by and taking krautrock into a new era. To put this in perspective, Bowie's Station to Station was released the same year as Flow Motion. Flow Motion, however, has subsequently been re-assessed, with Magnet Magazine labelling it a \\"hidden gem\\" in 2012.

He has been Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the East Lothian constituency since 2007, having previously represented Edinburgh Pentlands from 1999 to 2003. A former aid worker and teacher of mathematics and physics, Gray was first elected to the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 as MSP for the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency, which he lost to Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party David McLetchie in 2003. Gray was returned to Holyrood in 2007 as MSP for East Lothian. Following Wendy Alexander's resignation as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2008, Gray stood at the subsequent leadership election, and was elected with a 57.8% share of the vote in the second round. Initially, Gray oversaw some electoral successes for Scottish Labour, such as repelling SNP challenges at the Glenrothes (2008) and Glasgow North East (2009) by- elections, as well as seeing Scottish Labour retain all their 41 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election; despite the election overall resulting in the first UK hung parliament in 36 years, and the Labour Party being defeated after thirteen years in government. The 2011 Scottish Parliament elections proved disastrous for the party, which lost 20 seats as the SNP won an outright majority of seats. Gray himself was only re-elected as MSP for East Lothian with a narrow majority of 151 votes. Gray announced his resignation the day after the result, but remained in post as leader until his successor, Johann Lamont, took over on 17 December 2011. Due to his experience, Gray was appointed as Acting Leader of the Scottish Labour Party while a leadership and a deputy leadership election were being simultaneously held, on account of deputy leader Kezia Dugdale resigning to run for the leadership and the resignation of previous leader Jim Murphy after Scottish Labour's landslide defeat at the 2015 general election; where it lost 40 of its 41 seats to the SNP and Murphy himself lost his East Renfrewshire seat to the SNP's Kirsten Oswald. Early life and career Gray was educated at the state comprehensive Inverness Royal Academy and briefly privately at George Watson's College, Edinburgh. He studied physics at the University of Edinburgh before training as a teacher at Moray House College of Education. After graduation, he worked as a mathematics and physics teacher at Gracemount High School in Edinburgh before a teaching stint in Mozambique. He then spent twelve years as the campaigns director for the Scottish arm of the aid charity Oxfam. Political career Gray as a government minister Having previously stood as a candidate in Lothian Regional Council elections, Gray was first elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. Immediately after his election to Holyrood, he was made a deputy minister in the first Scottish Executive under Donald Dewar. Following Jack McConnell becoming First Minister in 2001, Gray was promoted to Minister for Social Justice. After the sudden resignation of Wendy Alexander (following disagreements with McConnell) in 2002, Gray took over her role as Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, where he was responsible for overseeing changes to Scottish higher education. At the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Gray was defeated by Scottish Conservative leader David McLetchie, who he had stood against in 1999. Leaving Holyrood, he went to work in London as a special adviser to Alistair Darling, who was Under-Secretary of State at the Scotland Office, and initially announced that he would not be seeking re-election. Having subsequently a change of mind, he was selected as the official Labour candidate for East Lothian for the 2007 election and subsequently won. Gray was appointed as Scottish Labour's Shadow spokesman for enterprise, energy and tourism upon his return to Holyrood. Following the resignation of Wendy Alexander over a foreign donation scandal, Gray announced in July 2008 that he would stand in the contest to find the next Leader of the Labour group in the Scottish Parliament, and was elected to this post in September 2008. In December 2010, Iain Gray sparked a diplomatic row when he appeared to claim in parliament that Montenegro had been involved in ethnic cleansing and war crimes during the 1990s Balkans Conflict.http://www.scotsman.com/news/iain_gray_urged_to_say_sorry_after_ethnic_cleansing_gaffe_sparks_diplomatic_row_1_1523919 On 7 April 2011, whilst campaigning at Glasgow Central station for the Scottish Parliament election, Gray was forced to cancel an event due to disruption by a group protesting against public spending cuts. He quickly left the station and ran into a nearby Subway outlet to escape the protesters, who followed him into the shop and continued to heckle him. Gray later stated that he had not been unsettled by the incident as \\"I spent two years working in the civil war in Mozambique, I've been to Rwanda two months after the genocide, I walked the killing fields in Cambodia and I was in Chile three days after Pinochet was demitted from office\\". Official parliamentary portrait, 2011 At the 2011 election, Labour suffered a net loss of seven seats, with many of their leading figures being defeated. Labour took a particularly severe beating in its Central Belt heartland, having to rely on regional lists in many cases. It was Labour's worst electoral performance in Scotland in eighty years. Gray himself was re-elected as MSP for East Lothian by the narrowest margin of his political career; with just 151 votes over the SNP candidate, making the Holyrood seat for the first time ever a Labour‚ÄìSNP marginal. He announced on 6 May that he would stand down as party leader in the autumn. Gray was reappointed to the post of Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance in the Scottish Labour Shadow Cabinet on 29 June 2013. On 13 June 2015, Gray was appointed Acting Leader of the Scottish Labour Party whilst a leadership and a deputy leadership election were simultaneously held, on account of deputy leader Kezia Dugdale resigning to run for the leadership. At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, while several Labour MSPs lost their seats, Gray retained his seat with an increased majority compared to 2011. Personal life Gray has been married twice. His first wife, Linda Malloch, divorced him and later married Gray's long-time friend Kevin Dunion, the Scottish Information Commissioner. Gray married his second wife Gill (a part-time constituency secretary to Labour MSP Mary Mulligan) in 1997, with whom he has two step- daughters. He is a lifelong fan of Edinburgh football club Hibernian, and enjoys reading, music and hill walking. He is a member of the Church of Scotland.

History The St. Mary's and Kingsland Railroad, incorporated on October 24, 1906, was founded in 1865 by Captain Lemuel Johnson. It received its charter from the state of Georgia, and its first two locomotives purchased were #207 and #308. The SM&K; eventually became the Atlantic, Waycross and Northern Railroad. After the death of Johnson in 1918, the railroad was sold to the Southern Fertilizer and Chemical Company in Savannah, Georgia, with the sale being completed on January 24, 1918. The AW&N; was sold in 1939 to Gilman Paper Company-St. Marys Kraft Corporation and became the St. Marys Railroad. The SM purchased its first diesel locomotive #500 in 1945 which was nicknamed the \\"Goat.\\" Ten years later the railroad constructed a 4-mile spur to service the US Army's Kings Bay ammunition storage facility which is now the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. The SM was merged into the Gilman Paper Company on January 11, 1999, and operated initially under the Gilman name. The Gilman Paper Company separated the railroad by establishing a limited liability corporation operating under the name of Saint Marys Railroad, LLC. On December 17, 1999, the paper plant and railroad were purchased by the Durango Paper Company (changing its name in 2000 to the Durango-Georgia Company) and the railroad was renamed the Durango Railroad. All federal reporting requirements for the railroad were filed under that name. The company declined to change its reporting marks however, thus the locomotives and rolling stock continued to use the St. Marys Railroad name. The Durango Paper Company closed its doors in 2002 after two industrial accidents at the plant resulted in nearly $200,000 in fines from OSHA. All employees of the paper plant lost their jobs, putting the future of the railroad in doubt. The railroad continues to operate and the St. Marys Railroad right-of-way and assets remain intact. The railroad has always maintained its own locomotives and cars with a fully equipped shop facility in St. Marys. In January 2007, the St. Marys Railroad, LLC was purchased by the Birmingham, Alabama-based Boatright Companies. The railroad continues to be fully operational with no change in its reporting marks. Current Locomotive 507 pulls a freight train in Kingsland, GA, in June 2016 Currently the St. Marys Railroad leases two locomotives; ex-NS 2379 (MP15DC, built as SOU 2379) and ex-NS 2389 (MP15DC, ex-SOU 2389). Annually, St. Marys Railroad moves approximately 1100 carloads of freight and 2000 railcars placed in and out of storage. Interchanges The only connection to other railroads along the 11 mile route is to the First Coast Railroad at Kingsland.

It has mostly smooth bark, lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and cylindrical to barrel-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus gunnii is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, mottled, white or grey bark, sometimes with persistent rough bark on the lower trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The juvenile leaves are heart-shaped to more or less round, greyish green or glaucous, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the same dull greyish to bluish green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical, rounded or flattened operculum. It flowers in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cylindrical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level or enclosed. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus gunnii was first formally described in 1844 by the British botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in the London Journal of Botany. The type material was collected \\"on the elevated tablelands of the interior of Tasmania, especially in the neighborhood of the lakes\\" by Ronald Campbell Gunn. The specific epithet honours the collector of the type material. Joseph Maiden's 1889 book The Useful Native Plants of Australia‚Äô recorded that common names in Tasmania are \\"cider gum\\" and in southeastern Australia occasionally as the \\"sugar gum\\" and that in the same part it is known as \\"white gum\\", \\"swamp gum\\" or \\"white swamp gum\\". In the Noarlunga and Rapid Bay districts of South Australia it is known as \\"bastard white gum\\", occasionally as \\"yellow gum.\\" Near Bombala, New South Wales two varieties go by the names of \\"flooded or bastard gum\\" and \\"red gum\\", although the species only occurs in Tasmania. Distribution and habitat Cider gum grows in woodland and occurs on the plains and slopes of the central plateaux and dolerite mountains at altitudes up to about , with isolated occurrences south of Hobart.Kirkpatrick, J.

An illustrated guide to identification. Reed Books, Melbourne Use in horticulture This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. This species is noted for exceptional cold tolerance for a eucalyptus (to ‚àí14 ¬∞C, exceptionally ‚àí20 ¬∞C for brief periods) and is now commonly planted as an ornamental tree across the British Isles and some parts of western Europe.Brooker, M. (1983). A Key to Eucalypts in Britain and Ireland. Forestry Commission Booklet 50. Fast-growing, it will produce a tree up to tall when mature,Tree Register of the British Isles with growth rates of up to , rarely , per year. Pruning can be employed to maintain the tree as a small shrub if required and more shaded spots will restrict growth. It does grow in full sun on sandy/chalky soils, well supplied with water, but prefers a loamy soil; it does not tolerate very wet sites. It is one of the most rustic eucalyptus trees alongside Eucalyptus pauciflora and Eucalyptus parvula. Uses The fragrant leaves give off essential oils when they are creased or burned, which are used in different forms (floral composition, infusion, tincture, oil, etc) to treat many respiratory diseases, rheumatism, migraines, fatigue and as antiseptic.Trees: field guide ; Johnson, Owen and More, David; translator: Pijoan Rotger, Manuel, ed.

The village was abandoned in March 1948 due to the threats of Jewish militias, two months before the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war. Today, Tel Aviv University lies on part of the village land. History According to local legend, the village was named for a local religious figure, al-Shaykh Muwannis, whose maqam was in the village. Ottoman era During the Ottoman era, Pierre Jacotin named the village Dahr on his map from 1799.Karmon, 1960, p. 170 Al-Shaykh Muwannis was noted in December 1821, as being \\"located on a hill surrounded by muddy land that was flooded with water despite the moderate winter\\".Berggren, \\"Resor i Europa och √∂sterlanderna\\", Stockholm, 1828, p.61; cited in Sand, 2012, p. 262 In 1856 the village was named Sheikh Muennis on the map of Southern Palestine that Heinrich Kiepert published that year.Kiepert, 1856, Map of Southern Palestine In 1870, Victor Gu√©rin noted about al-Shaykh Muwannis: \\"It contains four hundred inhabitants and is divided into several quarters, each under the jurisdiction of a particular sheikh. On the outskirts one can note some gardens where succulent watermelons grow, with hardly any horticultural care.\\"Gu√©rin, 1870, p. 274 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) noted \\"ruins of a house near the kubbeh\\",Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 275 while Al-Shaykh Muwannis was described as an ordinary adobe village.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 254 Most of the villagers were members of the Abu Kishk tribe.Morris, 2004, pp. 127‚Äì128 The village population was 315 in 1879.PEF; cited in Sand, 2012, p. 262 British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Shaik Muannes had a population of 664 residents, all Muslims.Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jaffa, p. 20 This had increased in the 1931 census when Esh Sheikh Muwannis had 1154 inhabitants, still all Muslims, in 273 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 14 In the 1920s, the government of the British mandate attempted to gain title to lands lying to the west of Al-Shaykh Muwannis and extending to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea on the grounds that it was \\"waste and uncultivated.\\" According to the authors of a book on the Israeli-Arab conflict, the Arabs of the Jaffa-Tel Aviv region \\"understood the implications of the Zionist-cum- British discourses of development generally and their implementation through town planning schemes.\\"Sufian and LeVine, p. 298 In 1937, the Arabic daily al Ja'miah al-Islamiyya commented on British plans to build a bypass road for Tel Aviv residents on what they claimed were village lands: \\"[I]n reality the plan in the Town Planning Commission now including Sheikh Muwannis is not really a 'plan', but rather a plan to take the land out of the hands of its owners.\\" Survey of Palestine 1932 1:20,000 Survey of Palestine 1945 1:250,000 There were two schools in the village, a boys' school built in 1932 and a girls' school built in 1943. 266 students were registered in these schools in 1945. The villagers worked in agriculture, particularly citrus cultivation. In the 1945 statistics, 3,749 dunums were used for growing citrus and bananas, and 7,165 dunums of village land was used for cereals. 66 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, irrigation water was drawn from al-Awja river and a large number of artesian wells.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 97 41 dunams of village lands were classified as built-up areas.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 147 In 1946, three Arab villagers raped a Jewish girl. In the midst of the court proceedings, members of the Haganah shot and wounded one of the attackers, and kidnapped and castrated another. In 1947, in the wake of growing hostility in the days leading up to the war, some of the villagers began to leave. Most stayed, as village notables had secured Haganah protection in exchange for keeping the peace and preventing Arab Liberation Army (ALA) irregulars from the using the village to attack Yishuv forces. Before the 1948 war, the population of al-Shaykh Muwannis was 2,000. 1948 war and aftermath Members of Harel Brigade on technical training course at Al-Shaykh Muwannis, 1948 In 1948, the population was largely made up of fellaheen who enjoyed friendly relations with Jews, despite occasional tension. While occasional shots were fired from the village toward Jewish residential areas in January and February 1948, there were no casualties, and the Abu Kishk abided by their promise to keep out ALA irregulars. The emissary of the ALA was informed by the Abu Kishk that \\"the Arabs of the area will cooperate with the Jews against any outside force that tries to enter.\\" Some intelligence reports, which were never corroborated, suggested that in early 1948 the village, which overlooked both the Sde Dov Airport and the Reading Power Station, was being infiltrated by heavily-armed Arab irregulars.Omer Bartov, 'From Buchach to Sheikh Muwannis:Building the Future and Erasing the Past,' ,' in Michele R. Rivkin-Fish, Elena Trubina (eds.), Dilemmas of Diversity After the Cold War: Analyses of \\"cultural Difference\\" by U.S. and Russia-based Scholars, Woodrow Wilson Center, 2010 pp.52-81. On 7 March, the Haganah's Alexandroni Brigade imposed a 'quarantine' on the village by closing off all access roads to it and two smaller satellite villages of Jalil al Shamaliyya and Jalil al Qibliya and may even have occupied houses on the edge of village. The underground Stern Gang (LHI) maintained one of its encampments in the village,Bartov p.68 and, five days later, on 12 March, militants from either the Irgun or Lehi groups kidnapped five village notables.Benny Morris, 'The causes and character of the Arab exodus from Palestine: the Israeli defense forces intelligence service analysis of June 1948,' in Ilan Papp√© (ed.), The Israel/Palestine Question, Routledge 1999 pp.169-183 pp.173-174. The Jewish Intelligence Services noted that > \\"many of the villagers ... began fleeing following the abduction of the > notables of Sheikh Muwannis. The Arab learned that it was not enough to > reach an agreement with the Haganah and that there were 'other Jews' of whom > to beware, and possibly to be aware of more than the Haganah, which had not > control over them.\\" The villagers then protested that Jewish forces in the area were subjecting them to intimidation, looting and shooting at them randomly. Though the notables were turned over to the Haganah on the 23 March and returned to Shaykh Muwannis, most of the villagers there and in other villages north of the Yarkon River continued to leave, as their confidence had been \\"mortally undermined\\". Tawfiq Abu Kishk threw a large parting 'banquet' for the remaining villagers and their Jewish friends on the 28 March 1948. After their departure, the village lands were promptly allocated for Jewish use by the Yishuv leaders, and were ultimately incorporated into the municipality of Tel Aviv. In the days following, the Abu Kishk leaders attributed their abandonment of the village to: \\"a) the [Haganah] roadblocks ... b) the [Haganah] limitations on movement by foot, c) the theft [by Jews?] of vehicles, and d) the last kidnapping of Sheikh Muwannis men by the LHI.\\" The villagers of Shaykh Muwannis became refugees, with the majority taking up residence in Qalqilya and Tulkarem. According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the village's remaining structures in 1992 consisted of several houses occupied by Jewish families and the wall of a house.Khalidi, 1992, p. 260 Soon after the war, it was used to accommodate members of the new Israeli Air Force and men from Mahal units. It was initially repopulated, from 1949 onwards, by Jews from North Africa, called \\"Moroccans\\" by other Jews in the area, and much of its land, as the North African Jews were relocated, was taken over for the development of Tel Aviv University,Bartov p.52,67-68 and the former home of the village sheikh, known as the 'Green House', serves as the University's faculty club.Bartov p.67 In a right of return march organized by the Israeli group Zochrot on Nakba Day in 2004, participants called upon the Tel Aviv municipality to name six streets in the city after Palestinian villages that had existed there until 1948, among them, Al-Shaykh Muwannis.

Biography=Family Born Mary Cavendish, she was the daughter of Sir William Cavendish, who died when she was about a year old, and his wife Bess of Hardwick. By all accounts, Mary inherited her mother's strong will and colourful character. Bess of Hardwick remarried to Sir William St. Loe, who left his wife everything when he died in 1564/5, making her one of the most eligible women in England; a number of important men began to court her, including George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury.

Marriage She married her stepbrother Gilbert Talbot, later the 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, in 1568. Their children were: *George, 1575‚Äì1577 *Mary, later Countess of Pembroke *Elizabeth, later Countess of Kent *John, born and died 1583 *Alethea, later Countess of Arundel Imprisonment Although her family was Anglican Protestant, Mary converted to Catholicism as an adult. This may have been one of the reasons why she gave financial assistance to her niece Arbella Stuart, who was also first cousin to the King, in 1610, with the knowledge that the latter was planning to elope to the Continent with her cousin William Seymour. This marriage was certain to enrage King James I of England, since William, like Arbella, had a respectable claim to the Throne (by most reckonings she was fourth in line to the Throne and he was sixth in line). For this Mary was imprisoned in the Tower of London. She was tried for her role in the elopement, and was heavily fined, but not released. Later, Arbella accused Mary of being involved in a Catholic plot. Arbella's biographer remarks that Mary's motives in aiding Arbella are very difficult to understand: even allowing that Mary was a Catholic, and fond of her niece, she was certainly intelligent enough to understand the dire consequences for herself.Durant, David N. Arbella Stuart-a Rival to the Queen Weidenfeld & Nicolson London 1978 p.200 Perhaps she relied on her husband's influence to save her from the Tower, and like her mother she was one of the few women of the time who was used to getting her own way.Durant p.200 Mary was deeply distressed by Arbella's death, especially since she had been assured that Arbella was on the road to recovery, and remarked that she could think of nothing else.Durant p.207 The court physician Th√©odore de Mayerne treated her for a spell of melancholy in which she imagined she had been poisoned.Joseph Browne, Theo. Turquet Mayernii Opera medica (London, 1703), pp. 182-5 In 1615, after Arbella's death, Mary was released from the Tower, partly in recognition of her role in detecting the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and partly because her husband was very ill.Durant p.209 However, a few years later, in 1618, she was called to give evidence in the course of an inquiry into the rumors that Arbella had secretly given birth to a child. Mary refused to testify, saying she had sworn a binding oath not to, and was returned to the Tower, where she remained until 1623, occupying the best lodgings.Durant p.209 Mary was not easily intimidated: Dorothy L. Sayers in her novel Gaudy Night described her as \\"uncontrollable by her menfolk, undaunted by the Tower, and contempuously silent before the Privy Council\\". Francis Bacon is said to have remarked that while Lord Shrewsbury was no doubt a great man, there was one greater than he, his wife. In fiction There is a brief sketch of her character in the mystery novel Gaudy Night by Dorothy L. Sayers, which is set in Shrewsbury College, a fictional Oxford college named in her honour. The heroine Harriet Vane studies Lady Shrewsbury's portrait and wonders why the college had chosen \\"so ominous a patroness... a great intellectual certainly, but something of a holy terror\\".

Aspects of the ideology that a party had when it was founded, persists even though the conditions and the party-base in society have changed. Scholars of this approach claim that the party's history determines how the party adapts to modern day challenges.Panebianco, Angelo (1988) Political parties: organization and power. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Google Books The left‚Äìright is still central in order to understand a party's policy, but the core of these theories is to compare the party's beliefs and values today with the ones at their founding. In analyzing a party's ideological orientation we must begin by analyzing the very origin of the party. One framework within this tradition is offered by Klaus von Beyme who identifies nine party-groups, or \\"familles spirituelles\\", that can be found in European liberal democracies today: # Liberal and Radical parties # Conservative parties # Socialist and Social Democratic parties # Christian Democratic parties # Communist parties # Agrarian parties # Regional and ethnic parties # Right-wing extremist parties # Ecology movement Von Beyme claims that at the time of their founding these parties reflected the needs to defend a particular kind of interests, but recognized that not every European party could be fitted into this schema. He has been criticized of being tempted to try to fit too many parties into this schema, when in reality there is not grounds for doing so. It needs to be said as well that quite many of the European parties classified into the categories above are regarded as having more or less lost contact with their original \\"famille spirituelle\\". Consequently one can wonder what, eg, the British Conservatives today have in common with their founding fathers hundreds of years ago, taking into account New Right ideas and certain aspects of liberalism applied by the party. Likewise the Norwegian Social Democratic party is widely held to have moved away drastically from its inception as a socialist party in 1889. Today this party has assumed more of a centralist role (regarding for instance issues like state ownership as well as abandoning their corporatist ties with the Norwegian Trade Association). One might ask what the point is of classifying the parties into these categories when they do not fit. The answer would be that one should look at the broad picture, and use von Beyme‚Äôs tool to make sense of certain tendencies in European politics. However, it would also be important to recognize the fact that western European societies have changed tremendously in course of the last decades regarding a number of issues. Therefore, by identifying these factors one might also broaden the understanding of the generally changing patterns of party ideology in Europe today, compared to the 1950s.

It originally aired on December 31, 1990. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the USS Enterprise becomes trapped within a field of two-dimensional lifeforms, while Counselor Troi struggles with the sudden unexpected loss of her empathic abilities. Plot Traveling through deep space, the Enterprise stops to investigate an odd phenomenon of phantom sensor readings. Meanwhile, ship's counselor Deanna Troi experiences pain and loses consciousness as her empathic abilities suddenly cease to work. The crew discovers they cannot resume course, as the Enterprise is caught up in a group of two-dimensional lifeforms. Without her powers, Troi suffers a tremendous sense of loss, and goes through several classic psychological stages, including denial, fear and anger. Ultimately, despite the reassurances of her friends, she resigns as ship's counselor, believing that without her empathic abilities she cannot perform her duties. Commander Data and Commander Riker determine that the two-dimensional creatures are heading for a cosmic string, with the Enterprise in tow, and that once they reach the string the ship will be torn apart. Realizing that Troi's loss and the ship's predicament are somehow linked, Captain Picard pleads with her to try and communicate with the strange creatures. After attempting to warn the creatures of the danger posed by the cosmic string, Troi posits that they are seeking out the cosmic string in much the way a moth is drawn to a flame. Working from this hypothesis, Data simulates the vibration of a cosmic string, using the deflector dish at a position well behind the Enterprise. The simulations eventually cause the creatures to briefly reverse their course, breaking their momentum long enough to allow the Enterprise to break free. Freed from the two-dimensional creatures' influence, Troi's empathic ability is restored. She discovers that her powers were never lost, but were instead overwhelmed by the two-dimensional creatures' strong emotions. Troi returns to her old job with a renewed confidence.

The album had little impact on the charts. The album features 1980s style rock n' roll/ synthesizers. He was lured away from Arista Records, but as cited by Manilow in an interview, the executives who brought him over were no longer there when the album was released. This may have led to poor record sales, as well as the album sound being primarily a modern uptempo and synthesized release sharply different from Manilow's renowned piano ballads. The album was Manilow's first of four albums with RCA Records. The other releases with the company are an original soundtrack album of his 1985 CBS television movie, Copacabana, in which he starred as Tony Starr with Annette O'Toole as Lola Lamarr.

After signing a contract with G-Series, Black broke through the mainstream with their debut studio album \\"‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ (Amar Prithibi)\\" (2002). Since then, they have released five studio albums and have appeared in some mixed albums. Their latest album \\"‡¶ä‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶∑ (Unomanush)\\" was released in 2016 by G-Series. They were one of key rock bands of the 2000s along with Nemesis and Stentorian, who popularized alternative rock music in Bangladesh. History= Formation and Early Days (1997‚Äì1998)  Childhood friends and schoolmates Jahangir \\"Jon\\" Kabir, Mushfeque Jahan and Tony Vincent (Mehmood Afridi Tony) always shared a similar passion towards music. Their time was mostly spent at each other's houses listening to records from bands such as Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden. Pearl Jam's debut album Ten had a profound effect on the three and is said to have been the tipping point at which they decided to take up music professionally. After convincing each other about their musical skills the trio decided to form a band and soon enough they were jamming at their friends homes. Initially they decided to name their group \\"Dope Smuglazz\\", as a wink to the irreverent parental fears of rock music and its supposed concurrent substance abuse, but soon enough shifted to the name \\"Black\\" by a suggestion from friend, classmate and future band member Asif Haque. The band would then be introduced to Zubair Hossain Imon, an old acquaintance of guitar player Asif, whom the band considers to be \\"The Stalwart Member\\" and their \\"Philosophical Mentor\\". He is widely known for helping the band with their songwriting, often directly contributing words and ideas. Black was formed in 1998 with the five members of Jon in vocals, Jahan in guitar, Tony in drums, Asif for additional guitar work and Tamzid Siddiq Spondon in bass. Soon enough Spondon and Asif parted ways with the band to follow each other's interests.  \\"‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ (Amar Prithibi)\\" (2001‚Äì2002)  In 2002, Black released their debut album titled ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ (Amar Prithibi). Work began on the album in late 2001, between which they had also released several other singles in various compilation albums, and came into completion fall of 2002. This album includes some of their classical hit songs like \\"‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶∞‡¶æ (Amra)\\", \\"‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ (Amar Prithibi)\\" and \\"‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º (Kothay)\\". The album also displayed Black's earlier heavy music influences in songs like \\"‡¶ï‡¶¨‡¶∞ (Kobor)\\" and \\"‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∂‡ßá (Andhokarer Pashe)\\".  \\"‡¶â‡ßé‡¶∏‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶∞ (Utshober Por)\\" and \\"Offbeat\\" (2003‚Äì2004)  Shortly after the release of ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ (Amar Prithibi), Black started working on their second studio album under the title ‡¶â‡ßé‡¶∏‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶∞ (Utshober Por). This album was completed at a much shorter time since the band already had enough material from ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ (Amar Prithibi) for a second album. The album was a departure from Black's usually heavy and alternative styling and instead focused on more mellow and folk oriented tunes and dealt with more self- exploratory writing. The album includes hit singles like \\"‡¶â‡ßé‡¶∏‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶∞ (Utshober Por)\\" and \\"‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶ï (Shlok)\\", which received frequent playback in commercial radio stations. Considering the sudden emergence of piracy in music, the album had sold well enough to have superseded ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ (Amar Prithibi). The album was received fairly well by critics despite having sold so well. Soon after releasing ‡¶â‡ßé‡¶∏‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶∞ (Utshober Por), the band took a stab at acting. The members of Black were cast as a ragtag group of street urchins in the teleplay \\"Offbeat\\". The soundtrack to the song ‡¶∏‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶∏‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶õ‡ßá(Se Je Boshe Ache) had been a collaborative effort between Black and Arnob. Death of Imran Ahmed Choudhury Mobin On 20 April 2005, returning home after successfully completing a tour in Chittagong the bus in which the band was on, crashed near a ditch on the road. The crash caused the death of Imran Ahmed Choudhury Mobin, a prominent sound engineer in the Bangladesh music industry and a close friend of the band. Band members Jon, Jahan and Tahsan suffered minor bruises and cuts while Tony and Miraz had to be hospitalised. The members of the band announced a hiatus until further notice. Miraz had been diagnosed with a permanently damaged patella and had to leave the band indefinitely.  \\"‡¶Ü‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞ (Abar)\\" (2007‚Äì2008)  After a five-year hiatus Black released their third studio album ‡¶Ü‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞ (Abar) at 10 July 2008. Under the sponsorship of Warid Telecom a press conference was held at Bashundhara City shopping mall, followed by a gala event for the album's launch. A documentary chronicling Black's career, including Imran Ahmed Choudhury Mobin's death, was shown and released publicly prior to ‡¶Ü‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞ (Abar) being launched. It was produced under Black's supervision and released through the G-Series label. The documentary features interviews by notable artists and figures amongst the Bangladesh music industry such as, Isha Khan Duray, Azam Khan, Saidus Sumon, Sheikh Monirul Alam Tipu and Iqbal Asif Jewel. This album was stated as one of the most commercially successful album in the history of Bangladeshi rock music.  \\"Black\\" (2009‚Äì2011)  In late 2009, Black stated on their official Facebook page they had started working on their fourth studio album since June and that it is planned to be self-titled, a first for the band. In mid 2010, bass player Shahriar Sagar parted with the band paving the way for former Aashor member Rafiqul Ahsan Titu to take the place. Upon his joining vocalist Jon Kabir says: Black released their 4th album, Black on 21 August 2011. Just after that Jon Kabir took a break from the band for an indefinite time of period. He stated that he along with his wife is going for higher studies in the end of 2012. As a part of that, he's getting prepared and in the meantime Black would perform with guest vocalists in concerts if they want to do so. Besides Jon also stated via Black's official Facebook fan page that he was working on a side project on music but not forming a band neither going solo. After a couple of months Jon opened a fan page on Facebook named \\"Indalo\\". It stated that he was working with Dio Haque from Nemesis on drums, Zubair Hasan from Aashor on guitar, Rafiqul Ahsan Titu of Black on bass.  \\"‡¶ä‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶∑ (Unomanush)\\" (2013-2016)  Black released their fifth studio album, named \\"‡¶â‡¶® ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶∑ (Unomanush)\\", on November 26, 2016, under G series. There are a total of eight songs in this album. All the songs are recorded in Acoustic Artz Studio. The album was officially launched at RCC with the physical CD. Eventually this is first album recorded by the newly included members Rubayet Chowdhury on vocals and Charlz Francis on bass guitar. Three of the songs have already been released with the music video \\"‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßá‡¶™\\", \\"‡¶ó‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßá\\" and \\"‡¶Ö‡¶ß‡¶∞‡¶æ\\".

History  The AVF was formed by General Constand Viljoen and three other generals from the South African Defence Force (SADF), and launched on 7 May 1993.van Rooyen,Johnann Hard Right: The New White Power in South Africa I.B. Tauris (1994) p113 The other three generals were Major General Tienie Groenewald, a former chief of military intelligence, Lieutenant General Koos Bischoff, former chief of operations of the SADF, and Lieutenant General Cobus Visser, a former head of investigations of the South African Police. The AVF President was Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the Conservative Party, and the chief secretary was Colonel Piet Botha. The AVF existed as an umbrella group for right wing groups rather than a party in itself. Other groups involved included the Boerestaat Party, the Herstigte Nasionale Party, and the Oranjewerkers. The AVF aimed to disrupt the 1994 elections. The AVF established a Volksrepubliek werkkomitee (\\"People's Republic working committee\\") to gather information and put the ideal of Afrikaner self- determination into practice.

Dedicated to Ravel's counterpoint teacher Andr√© Gedalge, the trio was first performed in Paris in January 1915, by Alfredo Casella (piano), Gabriel Willaume (violin), and Louis Feuillard (cello). A typical performance of the work lasts about 30 minutes.  Composition  Ravel had been planning to write a trio for at least six years before beginning work in earnest in March 1914. At the outset, Ravel remarked to his pupil Maurice Delage, \\"I‚Äôve written my trio. Now all I need are the themes.\\" During the summer of 1914, Ravel did his compositional work in the French Basque commune of Saint-Jean- de-Luz. Ravel was born across the bay in the Basque town of Ciboure; his mother was Basque, and he felt a deep identification with his Basque heritage. During the Trio's composition, Ravel was also working on a piano concerto based on Basque themes entitled Zazpiak Bat (Basque for \\"The Seven are One\\"). Although eventually abandoned, this project left its mark on the Trio, particularly in the opening movement, which Ravel later noted was \\"Basque in colouring.\\" However, Ravel's first biographer and friend Roland-Manuel had a different account of the theme's origin: > Our great musicians have never been ashamed of admiring a pretty tune from a > caf√© concert. It is said that it was in watching ice-cream vendors dancing a > fandango at Saint-Jean-de-Luz that Ravel picked up the first theme of his > Trio in A, a theme which he believed to be Basque, but wasn't.Roger Nichols > (ed.), Ravel Remembered (W. W. Norton & Company, 1987), p. 154. While initial progress on the Trio was slow, the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 spurred on Ravel to finish the work so that he could enlist in the army. A few days after France‚Äôs entry into the war, Ravel wrote again to Maurice Delage: \\"Yes, I am working on the Trio with the sureness and lucidity of a madman.\\" By September he had finished it, writing to Igor Stravinsky, \\"The idea that I should be leaving at once made me get through five months' work in five weeks! My Trio is finished.\\" In October, he was accepted as a nurse's aide by the Army, and in March 1916 he became a volunteer truck driver for the 13th Artillery Regiment. Musical overview In composing the Trio, Ravel was aware of the compositional difficulties posed by the genre: how to reconcile the contrasting sonorities of the piano and the string instruments, and how to achieve balance between the three instrumental voices ‚Äì in particular, how to make that of the cello stand out from the others, which are more easily heard. In tackling the former problem, Ravel adopted an orchestral approach to his writing: by making extensive use of the extreme ranges of each instrument, he created a texture of sound unusually rich for a chamber work. He employed coloristic effects such as trills, tremolos, harmonics, glissandos, and arpeggios, thus demanding a high level of technical proficiency from all three musicians. Meanwhile, to achieve clarity in texture and to secure instrumental balance, Ravel frequently spaced the violin and cello lines two octaves apart, with the right hand of the piano playing between them. Inspiration for the musical content of the Trio came from a wide variety of sources, from Basque dance to Malaysian poetry. However, Ravel did not deviate from his usual predilection for traditional musical forms. The Trio follows the standard format for a four-movement classical work, with the outer movements in sonata form flanking a scherzo and trio and a slow movement. Nevertheless, Ravel manages to introduce his own innovations within this conventional framework. Movements The Trio is written in the key of A minor and consists of four movements: I. Mod√©r√© According to Ravel, the first movement draws on the zortziko, a Basque dance form. The movement is notated in time, each bar being subdivided into a rhythmic pattern. The influence of Zazpiak Bat is most obvious in the opening theme, whose rhythm is identical to that of the Zazpiak Bat main theme but with halved note values. Also notable is the melody's stepwise movement before followed by a leap of a fourth; the opening themes of the other three movements are similarly constructed‚Äîin the second and fourth movements, the jump is of a fifth. Ravel employs sonata form in this movement but not without introducing his own touches. The second theme is presented in the tonic A minor, and reappears untransposed in the recapitulation but with different harmonies. To avoid overuse of the tonic key, Ravel ends the movement in the relative key of C major. In the recapitulation, the appearance of the main theme in the piano is superimposed over a rhythmically modified version of the second theme in the strings. This juxtaposition of themes was a favourite device of Ravel's, who used it in other works as well, such as the Menuet antique and the Menuet in Le Tombeau de Couperin. II. Pantoum: Assez vif This movement is based on a traditional scherzo and trio A-B-A form. The scherzo presents two themes: the piano opens with the spiky first theme in A minor, while the strings respond in double octaves with the smoother second theme in F minor. The name of the movement refers to a Malaysian verse form, in which the second and fourth lines of each four-line stanza become the first and third lines of the next. While Ravel never commented on the significance of the movement's title, Brian Newbould has suggested that the poetic form is reflected in the way these two themes are developed in alternation. The F-major melody of the trio is in a completely different metre () from the scherzo (). When the piano introduces it, the strings continue to play material derived from the scherzo in time, and the two time signatures continue to coexist in the different parts until the return of the trio. III. Passacaille: Tr√®s large The third movement is a passacaglia based on the piano's opening eight-bar bass line, which is derived from the first theme of the Pantoum. The cello joins next, followed by the violin. While the melody is passed between the three instruments, the movement builds singlemindedly to a powerful climax, then dies away. IV. Final: Anim√© Against a backdrop of violin arpeggio harmonics (previously used by Ravel in his Trois po√®mes de Mallarm√©) and double-stopped trills from the cello, the piano presents the five-bar first theme. As in the first movement, irregular time signatures are again in use: the movement alternates between and time. The trumpet calls in the development section (played by the piano after rehearsal number 7) may be an allusion to the declaration of war in August 1914, which coincided with Ravel's work on this movement.Roger Nichols, notes to CDA30029 As the most orchestral of the four movements, the Final exploits the resources of the three players to the utmost, and Ravel rounds off the entire work with a brilliant coda. Trivia * The first movement was used extensively as a soundtrack in the 1992 Claude Sautet-directed love triangle Un c≈ìur en hiver (A Heart in Winter), starring Emmanuelle B√©art, Daniel Auteuil and Andr√© Dussollier. The music credits in the film are given to Maurice Ravel. * An adapted version of the third movement features in the film Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). * In a 1993 London Proms concert Yan-Pascal Tortelier and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra premi√®red Tortelier's orchestration of the piece.

The melody is usually the secondary chime selection for most chiming clocks, the first being the Westminster. It is also the one of the two clock chime melody that have multiple variation, the other being the Ave Maria chimes. Dick Whittington story One version of the Whittington Chimes. The customary English theatre story, adapted from the life of the real Richard Whittington, is that the young boy Dick Whittington was an unhappy apprentice running away from his master, and heard the tune ringing from the bell tower of the church of St Mary-le-Bow in London in 1392.The bells that made cockneys Howse, Christopher, Daily Telegraph 2007-09-22, accessed 2007-10-30 The penniless boy heard the bells seemingly saying to him \\"Turn again Dick Whittington\\". Dick returned to London upon hearing the bells, where he went on to find his fortune and became the Lord Mayor of London four times. According to tradition, Whittington used the tune as a campaign song for his three returns to the office of mayor. A short version of the campaign song goes: :Turn again Dick Whittington, :Right Lord Mayor of London Town. Chimes of St. Mary le Bow The Whittington Chimes are lesser well known than the Westminster (Cambridge) chimes, despite being much older. The chimes are found in many early English bracket and longcase clocks. The melody was not given the name \\"Whittington Chimes\\" on domestic clocks until the late Victorian period onwards. There are 4 variations of this chime sequence. Currently the Whittington chime often available on grandfather clock movements that have selectable chimes and some quartz clocks. The bells in the tower of St. Mary le Bow all have inscriptions on them; the first letters of each inscription spell out: :D W H I T T I N G T O N Bawo & Dotter Chimes One of the Whittington chime variation is also known as the Bawo & Dotter chimes, and is usually found on many older German movements such as early models of Junghans grandfather clocks.

According to its website, over 7,200 orphaned or abandoned children are sponsored in the program. Targeted crisis relief programs In addition to its general community development and direct aid programs designed to reduce poverty and malnutrition, Food For The Poor provides targeted relief for humanitarian crises. On January 11, 2010, it announced initial success in introducing a new food source, the Basa fish, for the critically malnourished nation of Haiti. On January 13, 2010, it announced a major relief effort directed toward the people of the same nation to help recovery from the catastrophic January 12 earthquake which struck Port-au- Prince. Food For The Poor has built 16,204 housing units since the earthquake. Additionally, 44 schools were built or restored in the Port-au-Prince region. Shortly after Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti on Oct. 3, 2016, the charity set a goal to build 1,000 housing units in 100 days. The charity's teams in Haiti were able to build 1,086 housing units in 114 days, and now are helping storm victims replant crops and rebuild livestock to offset growing food scarcity Partners Food For The Poor partners with local organizations in the countries where they work. Jamaica, the first country assisted by Food For The Poor, today includes more than 1,800 churches as partners in the distribution of food, medicine, educational supplies and other needed items. Since 1989, the charity's street feeding program in Kingston, Jamaica has been operated in partnership with the Salvation Army.

Controversies The Palm Beach Post has documented controversies involving Food For The Poor. In 2000, Ferdinand Mahfood resigned as CEO amid allegations he diverted money to two female employees with whom he was sleeping. Ferdinand Mahfood ultimately admitted misappropriating $275,000 from FFP and took steps to pay the money back. Ferdinand's brother, Robin Mahfood took over as CEO amid the crisis. Between 2003 and 2007, FFP paid out $1.9 million in salary and benefits to five of his relatives. Until 2008, FFP also did business with two for-profit companies run by Mahfood's family, buying in four years more than $200,000 worth of sodas and knee-high water boots in deals Mahfood had a hand in approving. CEO Robin Mahfood received a salary of $364,874 in 2008 On April 11, 2018 the attorney general for the state of California, Xavier Becerra, filed a limited CEASE AND DESIST order to Food For The Poor, alleging its claim that 95.6% of all donations, including donated goods, to Food For The Poor went directly to programs that help the poor was incorrect and misleading and that the actual number (for 2013) was 66.2% of cash donations. The state also claims that the charity used improper accounting techniques where they would take the inflated US retail value of expiring pharmaceuticals that were donated or made available by Pharma companies for delivery to third world countries and count that value the same as cash donations. The state is ordering that the organization pay $1.088 million in fines and stop using the 95% statement. The charity continues to be licensed to solicit charitable funds in the state of California. Food for the Poor responded that it upholds the highest standards of integrity and honesty and that it is confident that it will demonstrate that its accounting and valuation practices and solicitations meet and often exceed legal requirements, as well as industry best practices.

He is based on the novel character Yoko Asakawa, daughter of Kazuyuki Asakawa. He also appears in the \\"official\\" sequel to the Ring Trilogy, named Ring 2. He is the son of Reiko Asakawa and Ryuji Takayama, is about seven years of age and like his parents (particularly his father) has supernatural powers, namely ESP. He, like Sadako, has been considered a monster due to his strange powers and mysterious personality. To close family members in Ring and Ring fans (ringworms) his pet name is \\"Yo-chan\\" Characterisation Yoichi Asakawa, born 1990, is the seven-year-old son of Reiko Asakawa and Ryuji Takayama. He lives with his mother in a small flat in Tokyo. His parents divorced when he was young (four-years-old, it is suggested), and he has very little contact with his father, if any. He was very close to his cousin, Tomoko Oishi (whom he and his mother call \\"Tomo-chan\\"). She was the daughter of his mother's elder sister, Yoshimi, and Yoichi was very negatively affected by her death. Yoichi is very independent and quiet for a boy of his age. Without a male role-model, he has made himself \\"man of the house\\", and takes it in his stride to help look after his mother. He tries to support her by helping her; he lays out a change of clothes for her when she comes home from work, walks to school alone and prepares his own dinner. The only person he seems to have a close relationship with is his maternal grandfather, Koichi Asakawa, with whom he acts like a normal seven-year-old. Yoichi is very similar to his father in looks, behaviour and feelings; both are aloof and suppress their feelings. Despite their estrangement, they appear to have a special connection, in which they can sense when they are both in danger. He clearly loves both his parents, as demonstrated in Ring 2, but his relationship to both of them is also on a supernatural level. He is able to see his cousin, Tomoko, who tells him to watch the cursed videotape that his parents are investigating. After Yoichi watches the videotape, his parents begin to push themselves harder to try to find a way to save themselves. They leave Yoichi with his grandfather and learn more about the video. They discover its origin and its creator, Sadako Yamamura. Upon finding her body and laying it to rest, Reiko does not die and they believe she is saved. Following the events they have been through, a reconciliation between Yoichi's parents seems likely, as Reiko and Ryuji appear ready to try again at being a family. However, the hope amounts to nothing as Ryuji dies the next day at his deadline. Reiko realizes (with the help of Ryuji's spirit) that the way to save yourself is to copy the tape and show it to someone else. She travels to her father's house and Yoichi does the same thing as his mother did, giving his grandfather the tape.  Extra- sensory perception  Yoichi, like his parents, is clairvoyant and seems to each have a certain amount of ESP. Ryuji and Reiko have both demonstrated signs that they can sense spirits when they are in the same room. The three are connected on a supernatural level; if one is in danger the other two family members know it. Ring Yoichi see and feel his dead cousin Tomoko's presence in her old bedroom and, like Ryuji, he appears to receive a headache upon entering places where spirits are present. This leads him to him watching the videotape like his parents when Tomoko's spirit tells him to do so. Ryuji felt Yoichi's danger when he watched the video and sent out a warning. Upon his father's death, Yoichi appears to feel the loss of his father's aura. Ring 2 Yoichi takes a more direct role in the plot to the sequel. Following his father's death he is rendered unable to speak. He takes to hiding in public places near where his father lived, leading to Mai Takano finding where he and Reiko are hiding. He begins to develop supernatural powers beyond those he had in the original film that take a less realistic effect. Yoichi recovers his speech once he realizes the police are trying to take him away from his mother, subsequently leading to Reiko's death when she enters one of her visions from which she never awakens as she is hit by a truck. After this Yoichi begins to lose control of his powers from the hate he has for the circumstances that led to his parents' deaths. At the Yamamura Inn Yoichi causes a huge paranormal disturbance in which Shizuko and Sadako appear. Yoichi is used a medium to summoned Sadako as he is judged the only one strong enough to do it. He refuses to cooperate with Dr. Kawajiri at first and is only coaxed into using his power when Mai is blamed for his mother's death, provoking his hate. He loses control of his power as a result and causes the death of three people. Yoichi transports Mai and himself to the well and tells her leave to let him fall. However Ryuji recovers Yoichi from the bottom of the well and takes his hate, preventing him from becoming like Sadako.  Relationship with Ryuji  Although the reasons for Ryuji and Reiko‚Äôs divorce are never explained, Yoichi and Ryuji appear to hold a close supernatural bond despite having little contact with each other. He resembles Ryuji not only in clairvoyance but also personality and even mathematic ability. Ryuji is also seems to feel the need to look out for Yoichi; during the first film he asks after him to Reiko and asks if he will be okay being left alone late, to which Reiko replies sadly, \\"He's used to it.\\" In Ring 2 Ryuji's death, and then Reiko's, leads Yoichi's powers to become more sinister and like Sadako's. It is Ryuji who saves Yoichi when he tries to kill himself and takes his hate away, saving him from Sadako's influence. In Rasen the relationship is slightly more complex. Takano tells Andou that Ryuji did not want Yoichi or Reiko to die although he always regretted having a child. Ryuji does not desire to bring Yoichi back to life through Sadako as Andou does with his son, stating that he \\"couldn't be so cruel\\" to bring Yoichi back into this world. This suggests that he has foreseen the destruction Sadako will bring and feels it is better that Reiko and Yoichi are dead. Relationship with Reiko Yoichi seems to have a normal relationship with his mother Reiko. He supports her by helping her as demonstrated in Ring. Yoichi is badly affected by her death in Ring 2, seeing as how his father Ryuji had already died, Reiko was all he had left. He loses control of his powers after she dies, but it is revealed that her spirit is still watching over him. Other incarnations Yoichi Asakawa is the movie version of Yoko Asakawa from the novels. However, the novel character is a baby, and does not participate in the plot of the book, except having watched the videotape, when her mother Shizuka Asakawa plays it and watches it.Ring, Koji Suzuki In the Korean film adaptation, The Ring Virus, Hong Booram, is the daughter of single-mother Sun-Joo Hong. In fact, she appears to be about the same age as Yoichi, but other than having watched the videotape, does not participate in the plot.The Ring Virus In the American film adaptations, Aidan Keller(David Dorfman), is the son of single- mother Rachel Keller, and has psychic powers, and participates in the plot, similar to Yoichi.The Ring  References  External links  Category:Fictional psychics Category:Film characters introduced in 1998 ","title":"Yoichi Asakawa"},{"id":"4130031","text":"\\"The Death of Queen Jane\\" is an English ballad that describes the events surrounding the death of a Queen Jane. It is catalogued by Francis James Child as Child #170. Some of the versions given are Scottish, in which the queen's name is Jeanie or Jeany. Due to the close correspondence of names and events, it is often thought that the queen in question is Jane Seymour, the third wife of Henry VIII of England, but this cannot be confirmed. Historically, Jane Seymour gave birth to a son who became Edward VI of England on October 12, 1537. The birth was difficult but natural. She died twelve days later of infection resulting from the birth. Synopsis There are 20 versions of the song given by Child, but they are consistent in the basic tale. Queen Jane is in difficult labour ‚Äì the time given ranges from three days to an astonishing six weeks ‚Äì and asks a succession of people to cut open her sides and save her baby. Each refuses her in turn, understanding that this would cause her death. She asks for others to be sent to her ‚Äì variously her mother, a surgeon or doctor, and King Henry ‚Äì and of each she makes the same request. Finally someone ‚Äì King Henry in most versions ‚Äì succumbs to her pleas and the surgery is done, whereupon she dies. The song ends with descriptions of the mourning, and most versions contrast the joy at the birth of a male heir with the grief over the death of the queen. Versions The relationship between Queen Jane and King Henry is described as a loving one in the ballad. In the versions in which he is sent for to hear her plea he is shown as first refusing: Only when she falls into a swoon ‚Äì presumably interpreted that she was going to die anyway - are her instructions followed. Version 170D makes this explicit: Many versions describe King Henry weeping, his grief for his wife overcoming his joy for his son.

The first creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain on 21 August 1786 when the soldier and administrator Sir Guy Carleton was made Lord Dorchester, Baron of Dorchester (on Thames), in the County of Oxford. He was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Christopher Carleton, eldest son of the first Baron. Lord Dorchester died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his first cousin, the third Baron. He was the son of the Hon. George Carleton, younger son of the first Baron. He had no sons and was succeeded by his first cousin, the fourth Baron. He was the son of Reverend the Hon. Richard Carleton, younger son of the first Baron. Lord Dorchester was a Colonel in the Coldstream Guards. He was childless and the title became extinct on his death on 13 November 1897. The peerage was revived on 2 August 1899 when the Honourable Henrietta Carleton was made Baroness Dorchester, of Dorchester in the County of Oxford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. She was the elder daughter of the third Baron of the first creation. She was the wife of, firstly, Francis Paynton Pigott, and, secondly, of Major-General Richard Langford Leir. In 1899 she assumed by Royal licence the surname of Carleton. She was succeeded by her son from her first marriage, the second Baron. He was a soldier and fought in the Second Boer War and the First World War. He had two daughters but no sons and on his death in 1963 the title became extinct for the second time. As indicated by the territorial designations, the titles referred to Dorchester in Oxfordshire (also known as Dorchester-on-Thames), and not to the more famous Dorchester, county town of Dorset.

A signage also means signs collectively or being considered as a group. The term signage is documented to have been popularized in 1975 to 1980. Signs are any kind of visual graphics created to display information to a particular audience. This is typically manifested in the form of wayfinding information in places such as streets or on the inside and outside buildings. Signs vary in form and size based on location and intent, from more expansive banners, billboards, and murals, to smaller street signs, street name signs, sandwich boards and lawn signs. Newer signs may also use digital or electronic displays. The main purpose of signs is to communicate, to convey information designed to assist the receiver with decision-making based on the information provided. Alternatively, promotional signage may be designed to persuade receivers of the merits of a given product or service. Signage is distinct from labeling, which conveys information about a particular product or service. Definition and etymology The term, 'sign' comes from the old French signe (noun), signer (verb), meaning a gesture or a motion of the hand. This, in turn, stems from Latin 'signum' indicating an\\"identifying mark, token, indication, symbol; proof; military standard, ensign; a signal, an omen; sign in the heavens, constellation.\\"Online Dictionary of Etymology, http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sign In the English, the term is also associated with a flag or ensign. In France, a banner not infrequently took the place of signs or sign boards in the Middle Ages. Signs, however, are best known in the form of painted or carved , inns, cinemas, etc. They are one of various emblematic methods for publicly calling attention to the place to which they refer. The term, 'signage' appears to have come into use in the 20th century as a collective noun used to describe a class of signs, especially advertising and promotional signs which came to prominence in the first decades of the twentieth century.Collins Dictionary, https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/signage The Oxford Dictionary defines the term, signage, as \\"Signs collectively, especially commercial or public display signs.\\"Oxford English Dictionary, Online: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/signage History A coat of arms at Castle Borbeck Some of the earliest signs were used informally to denote the membership of specific groups. Early Christians used the sign or a cross or the Ichthys (i.e. fish) to denote their religious affiliations, whereas the sign of the sun or the moon would serve the same purpose for pagans.Van Voorst, R., RELG: World, Cengage, 2012, p. 257t The use of commercial signage has a very ancient history. Retail signage and promotional signs appear to have developed independently in the East and the West. In antiquity, the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks were known to use signage. In ancient Rome, signboards were used for shop fronts as well as to announce public events.Beard, F.K., \\"The Ancient History of Advertising: Insights and Implications for Practitioners: What Today's Advertisers and Marketers Can Learn from Their Predecessors,\\" Journal of Advertising Research, vol. 57 no. 3, pp 239‚Äì244 DOI: 10.2501/JAR-2017-033 Roman signboards were usually made from stone or terracotta. Alternatively, they were whitened areas, known as albums on the outer walls of shops, forums and marketplaces. Many Roman examples have been preserved; among them the widely recognized bush to indicate a tavern, from which is derived the proverb, \\"A good wine needs no bush\\".Corballis, P., Pub Signs, Lennard/Queen Anne; 1989 Apart from the bush, certain identifiable trade signs that survive into modern times include the three balls of pawnbrokers and the red and white barber's pole. Of the signs identified with specific trades, some of these later evolved into trademarks. This suggests that the early history of commercial signage is intimately tied up with the history of branding and labelling.Beard, F.K., \\"A History of Advertising and Sales Promotion,\\" in The Routledge Companion to Marketing History, D.G. Brian Jones and Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, pp 201‚Äì224 Recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail signage systems.Moore, K. and Reid., S., \\"The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding,\\" Business History, Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419‚Äì32. One well- documented early, example of a highly developed brand associated with retail signage is that of the White Rabbit brand of sewing needles, from China's Song Dynasty period (960- 1127 CE).Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., \\"Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China,\\" Advances in Consumer Research, [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008; Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., \\"A Brief History of Branding in China,\\" Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010 A copper printing plate used to print posters contained message, which roughly translates as: ‚ÄúJinan Liu‚Äôs Fine Needle Shop: We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time.‚ÄùZonggghuo lish bowu guan (ed.), Zonggghuo godai shi cako tulu: song yuan shiqi, Shanghai, Shanghai Educational Institute, 1991, p. 109 The plate also includes a trademark in the form of a 'White Rabbit\\" which signified good luck and was particularly relevant to the primary purchasers, women with limited literacy. Details in the image show a white rabbit crushing herbs, and included advice to shoppers to look for the stone white rabbit in front of the maker's shop. Thus, the image served as an early form of brand recognition.Petty, R.D., \\"A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing,\\" in The Routledge Companion to Marketing History, D.G. Brian Jones, Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 99 Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty, Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite.Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. \\"A Brief History of Branding in China,\\" Journal of Macromarketing, Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, p. 212 The rise of a consumer culture prompted the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, trademark protection and sophisticated brand concepts.Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. \\"A Brief History of Branding in China,\\" Journal of Macromarketing, Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, p. 219 During the Medieval period, the use of signboards was generally optional for traders. However, publicans were on a different footing. As early as the 14th century, English law compelled innkeepers and landlords to exhibit signs from the late 14th-century. In 1389, King Richard II of England compelled landlords to erect signs outside their premises. The legislation stated \\"Whosoever shall brew ale in the town with intention of selling it must hang out a sign, otherwise he shall forfeit his ale.\\" Legislation was intended to make public houses easily visible to passing inspectors of the quality of the ale they provided (during this period, drinking water was not always good to drink and ale was the usual replacement). In 1393 a publican was prosecuted for failing to display signs. The practice of using signs spread to other types of commercial establishments throughout the Middle Ages.Stuart, H., \\"Employee Identification with the Corporate Identity,\\" International Studies of Management and Organization, Vol. 32, No. 3, 2002 Similar legislation was enacted in Europe. For instance, in France edicts were issued 1567 and 1577, compelling innkeepers and tavern- keepers to erect signs.Roth. D., The History of Retail in 100 Objects, 2014, Online: http://www.davidroth.com/history-retail-100-objects-signage/ Bath, England Large towns, where many premises practiced the same trade, and especially, where these congregated in the same street, a simple trade sign was insufficient to distinguish one house from another. Thus, traders began to employ a variety of devices to differentiate themselves. Sometimes the trader used a rebus on his own name (e.g. two cocks for the name of Cox); sometimes he adopted a figure of an animal or other object, or portrait of a well-known person, which he considered likely to attract attention. Other signs used the common association of two heterogeneous objects, which (apart from those representing a rebus) were in some cases merely a whimsical combination, but in others arose from a popular misconception of the sign itself (e.g. the combination of the leg and star may have originated in a representation of the insignia of the garter), or from corruption in popular speech (e.g. the combination goat and compasses is said by some to be a corruption of God encompasses). Around this time, some manufacturers began to adapt the coats of arms or badges of noble families as a type of endorsement. These would be described by the people without consideration of the language of heraldry, and thus such signs as the Red Lion, the Green Dragon, etc., have become familiar, especially as pub signs. By the 17th and 18th centuries, the number of commercial houses actively displaying the royal arms on their premises, packaging and labelling had increased, but many claims of royal endorsement were fraudulent. By 1840, the rules surrounding the display of royal arms were tightened to prevent false claims. By the early 19th century, the number of Royal Warrants granted rose rapidly when Queen Victoria granted some 2,000 royal warrants during her reign of 64 years.Barford, V., \\"Royal warrants: What they tell us about the Royal Family,\\" BBC News Magazine, 12 July 2013, Online: https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23255710 The red-light district in Amsterdam Since the object of signboards was to attract the public, they were often of an elaborate character. Not only were the signs themselves large and sometimes of great artistic merit (especially in the 16th and 17th centuries, when they reached their greatest vogue) but the posts or metal supports protruding from the houses over the street, from which the signs were swung, were often elaborately worked, and many beautiful examples of wrought-iron supports survive both in England and continental Europe. Exterior signs were a prominent feature of the streets of London from the 16th century. Large overhanging signs became a danger and a nuisance in the narrow ways as the city streets became more congested with vehicular traffic. Over time, authorities were forced to regulate the size and placement of exterior signage. In 1669, a French royal order prohibited the excessive size of sign boards and their projection too far over the streets. In Paris in 1761, and in London, about 1762‚Äì1773, laws were introduced which gradually compelled sign boards to be removed or fixed flat against the wall. For the most part, signs only survived in connection with inns, for which some of the greatest artists of the time painted sign boards, usually representing the name of the inn. With the gradual abolition of sign boards, the numbering of houses began to be introduced in the early 18th century in London. It had been attempted in Paris as early as 1512, and had become almost universal by the close of the 18th century, though not enforced until 1805. Another important factor was that during the Middle Ages a large percentage of the population was illiterate and so pictures were more useful as a means of identifying a public house. For this reason there was often no reason to write the establishment's name on the sign and inns opened without a formal written name‚Äîthe name being derived later from the illustration on the public house's sign. In this sense, a pub sign can be thought of as an early example of visual branding.Martin, J., Stanley Chew's Pub Signs: A Celebration of the Art and Heritage of British Pub Signs, Images Booksllers, 1993 Neon sign During the 19th century, some artists specialized in the painting of signboards, such as the Austro-Hungarian artist Demeter Laccataris. Pending this development, houses which carried on trade at night (e.g. coffee houses, brothels, etc.) had various specific arrangements of lights, and these still survive to some extent, as in the case of doctors' surgeries, and chemists' dispensaries. Several developments in the early 20th century provided the impetus for widespread commercial adoption of exterior signage. The first, spectaculars, erected in Manhattan in 1892, became commonplace in the first decade of the 20th century and by 1913, \\"the skies were awash with a blaze of illuminated, animated signs.\\"Starr, T. and Hayman, E., Signs and Wonders: The Spectacular Marketing of America, Doubleday, 1998 In the 1920s, the newly developed neon sign was introduced to the United States. Its flexibility and visibility led to widespread commercial adoption and by the 1930s, neon signs were a standard feature of modern building around the world.Ribbat, C. and Anthony, M., Flickering Light: A History of Neon, London, Reakteon Books,2013, p. 11 Privilege signs, which employed the manufacturer's brand as a form of retail endorsement, were common on retail stores during the 20th century, but their use has waned as retailers gained increasing power in the late 20th century. A small number of privilege signs are still present, but most have become abandoned ghost signs. An early computer generated hard copy of various size metal printed characters for displays was introduced and patented in 1971, Patent US3596285A, may have been the first data driven printed example of signage in the USA.

Highway signs, Billboards, digital displays of stock market quotes, etc. * Persuasion: promotional signage designed to persuade users of the relative merits of a company, product or brand. * Direction/ Navigation: signs showing the location of services, facilities, functional spaces and key areas, such as sign posts or directional arrows. * Identification: signs indicating services and facilities, such as room names and numbers, restroom signs, or floor designations. * Safety and Regulatory: signs giving warning or safety instructions, such as warning signs, traffic signs, exit signs, signs indicating what to do in an emergency or natural disaster or signs conveying rules and regulations. * Navigation ‚Äì may be exterior or interior (e.g. with interactive screens in the floor as with \\"informational footsteps\\" found in some tourist attractions, museums, and the like or with other means of \\"dynamic wayfinding\\".Taylor, C.R.

Signs used on the exterior of a building are often designed to encourage people to enter and on the interior to encourage people to explore the environment and participate in all that the space has to offer. Any given sign may perform multiple roles simultaneously. For example, signage may provide information, but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service or retail environment.Bitner, M.J., \\"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 57 -71Katz, K.L. and Rossiter, J., \\"Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach,\\" in Bateson, J.E.G., Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings, Dryden, Orlando, Fl, 1991, pp 227‚Äì243 Signage conventions=Pictograms A bilingual wet floor sign Pictograms are images commonly used to convey the message of a sign. In statutory signage, pictograms follow specific sets of colour, shape and sizing rules based on the laws of the country in which the signage is being displayed. For example, In UK and EU signage, the width of a sign's pictogram must be 80% the height of the area it is printed to. In the US, in order to comply with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines,https://martinadasigns.com/questions-people-ask-about-signs/ the same pictogram must be located within its own defined field, with raised characters and braille located beneath the field. For a pictogram to be successful it must be recognizable across cultures and languages, even if there is no text present. Following standard color and shape conventions increases the likelihood that the pictogram and sign will be universally understood. Sign shape The shape of a sign can help to convey its message. Shape can be brand- or design-based, or can be part of a set of signage conventions used to standardize sign meaning. Usage of particular shapes may vary by country and culture. Some common signage shape conventions are as follows: * Rectangular signs are often used to portray general information to an audience. * Circular signs often represent an instruction that must be followed, either mandatory or prohibitive. * Triangular signs are often warning signs, used to convey danger or caution.

Lighting Signs frequently use lighting as a means of conveying their information or as a way to increase visibility. Neon signs, introduced in 1910 at the Paris Motor Show, are produced by the craft of bending glass tubing into shapes. A worker skilled in this craft is known as a glass bender, neon or tube bender. Light-emitting diode (LED) technology is frequently used in signs. This technology, first used primarily at sporting events, later appeared at businesses, churches, schools, and government buildings. Brightness of LED signs can vary, leading to some municipalities in the United States banning their use due to issues such as light pollution. Today, LED technology is also used in light panels to illuminate advertising graphics in public places including malls, subways, and airports.

Its campus, which dates to its founding, is a National Historic Landmark. Friends Hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Mission The 1813 mission statement of the hospital was \\"To provide for the suitable accommodation of persons who are or may be deprived of the use of their reason, and the maintenance of an asylum for their reception, which is intended to furnish, besides requisite medical aid, such tender, sympathetic attention as may soothe their agitated minds, and under the Divine Blessing, facilitate their recovery.\\" History The Quakers established Friends Hospital in 1813, drawing on a belief that all persons could live a \\"moral, ordered existence if treated with kindness, dignity, and respect\\", despite disabilities. The influential minister Thomas Scattergood decried what he considered the harsh conditions faced by patients in mental asylums; Scattergood instead called for the \\"moral treatment\\" of patients. This model served as an inspiration for the establishment of the Friends Asylum for Persons Deprived of the Use of Their Reason; it was the nation's first privately run psychiatric hospital.

Founded in the first half of the 10th century, it was one of the oldest elected assemblies in the world.Oscarsson, 1000 √•r av frihet sid. 23 All male inhabitants of J√§mtland province were allowed to attend, making the gathered congregation rather large compared to the J√§mtland population.

Etymology Unlike other Scandinavian assemblies, it is referred to as a m√≥t, not √æing, both meaning 'assembly'. The word m√≥t is found in e.g. the political institution Witenagemot in Anglo-Saxon England. Function The Jamtam√≥t was the highest authority in J√§mtland during the time it was most prominent. Disputes were settled and judgments given in criminal cases. In addition the assembly worked as a kind of government in relation to other Scandinavian lagting areas, as the council decided on tax issues. The Jamtam√≥t initially had no king over it, and hence J√§mtland in the period before 1178 is regarded as a peasant republic. All free men had to participate, and the most prominent men in the different families deliberated and jointly discussed various issues concerning the country. Decisions on important matters were taken, enhanced by asking and informing everyone assembled.Ekerwald, J√§mtarnas historia intill 1319 sid. 124 There are theories that the Jamtam√≥t decided to turn J√§mtland to Christianity during the 1000s, shortly after the Battle of Stiklestad. History There is some evidence that the population of Viking Age Scandinavia strived to reproduce the ‚Äúideal assembly site‚Äù, described in Eddic poetry. The Jamtam√≥t continued to operate after falling under Norwegian control with the loss at the Battle of Storsj√∂n in 1178. Even when Norway was centralized, the Jamtam√≥t continued. When the Kalmar Union was formed, and J√§mtland ended up far from the central power, the althing again increased its significance. In the late 15th century the Jamtam√≥t was a Norwegian Legislative Assembly. It lost its status as a judicial body but was not abolished, and J√§mtland came to have two parallel assemblies. In the 16th century, J√§mtland became a Danish county. After the Swedish occupation of J√§mtland in the Northern Seven Years' War (1564-1570), King Christian IV forbade the Denmark assembly, but it continued to exist in secret and in the protection of the market week. After J√§mtland became Swedish in 1645, parts of the Jamtam√≥t were transferred to a Swedish rural summer assembly called J√§mtland landsj√§mnadsting. During the last half of the 19th century, the J√§mtland landsj√§mnadsting was the only existing county council in Sweden. The 1862 municipal ordinances resulted in the creation of counties throughout all Swedish provinces. The only difference in J√§mtland was that it now also included representatives from H√§rjedalens parishes in the county. The J√§mtland County Council is therefore the only county in Sweden with a continuity from its roots as a medieval Germanic general assembly. Jamtamot in the present There is an unbroken link between today's J√§mtland County Council and the medieval althing from the time the J√§mtland operated independently, without any king. J√§mtland's population has declined since the 1950s, and the government has proposed amalgamation between J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen. The center partist H√•kan Larsson, a former member of the Swedish parliament coming from J√§mtland, is one of the most serious politicians arguing for a reestablishment of Jamtam√≥t. On his home page where he presents his vision of J√§mtland year 2052 he writes: \\"Sedan dess har sj√§lvstyret st√§rkts och i dag har l√§net ungef√§r samma sj√§lvstyrande roll inom Sverige som √Öland hade inom Finland redan p√• 1900-talets slut. Jamtamot har utvecklats till ett starkt regionalt parlament. Ett tecken p√• uppslutningen bakom parlamentet √§r att h√§rjedalingarna numera aldrig talar om att l√§mna J√§mtlands l√§n f√∂r G√§vleborg.\\"H√•kan Larsson, Och nu var det 2052 ‚Äì hur kom vi hit?, Centerpartiet i J√§mtlands l√§ns webbplats which roughly translates to: \\"Since then the autonomy has become strengthened and today the county [of J√§mtland] has approximately the same role of autonomy within Sweden as √Öland had within Finland already in the end of the 20th century. Jamtam√≥t has developed into a strong regional parliament. A sign of the support behind the parliament is that nowadays, the people of H√§rjedalen never speak about leaving the county of J√§mtland for G√§vleborg.\\" See also * Althing * J√§mtland References Category:History of J√§mtland ","title":"Jamtam√≥t"},{"id":"4130076","text":":See also Popilius (disambiguation) Publius Popillius Laenas was consul in 132 BC, and builder of the Via Popilia.

He lived sometime near the fall of the Arsacid (Parthian) Empire in the early 3rd century CE. Identity of Sasan=Medieval sources There are many slightly different stories concerning Sasan and his relation to Ardashir I, the founder of the Sasanian Empire. The northern Iranian historian Tabari mentions that Sasan married a princess of the BƒÅzarangid family, the vassal dynasty of PƒÅrs, and that Sasan was a grandfather of Ardashir I, while Papak is named as Ardashir I's father. According to the Pahlavi book of Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan, Sasan's wife was a daughter of a nobleman called Papak. The marriage was arranged by Papak after hearing that Sasan has \\"Achamenian (Achaemenid) blood in him\\". Their son was Ardashir I. Sasan vanishes shortly after Ardashir appears in the story and Papak is \\"considered the father of Ardashir\\". These stories on different relations between Ardashir, PƒÅpak, and SƒÅsƒÅn have, according to Frye, a Zoroastrian explanation. Sasan was indeed the father of Ardashir and \\"disappears\\" from the story after the birth of Ardashir. Similar to the current Zoroastrian practices, Papak had then taken the responsibility of his daughter and her son Ardashir after Sasan \\"disappears\\" and is named afterwards as the father of Ardashir. In the Kabe Zartosht inscription of Shapur I the Great, the four named persons \\"Sasan, Papak, Ardashir, Shapur\\" have different titles: Sasan is named as hwataw or xwadƒÅy (\\"the lord\\", usually given to sovereigns of small local principalities), Papak as shah, Ardashir as shƒÅhanshƒÅh (\\"King of Kings of the Sasanian Empire\\") and Shapur as \\"King of Kings of Iran and Aniran\\". Modern sources However, according to Touraj Daryaee, Sasanian sources cannot be trusted because they were from the royal Sasanian archives, which were made by the court, in the words of Daryaee, \\"to fit the world-view of the late Sasanian world\\". Daryaee and several other scholars state that Sasan had his name from a deity who was known in many parts of Asia but not in Fars, the homeland of the Sasanians, which thus means that Sasan was an Iranian foreigner from the west or the east who had settled in Fars, whose inhabitants did not know about this deity he believed in. Sasan later managed to become the priest of the important Anahid temple in Estakhr, the capital of Fars. According to the Bundahishn, which according to Daryaee was made independently and not by the Sasanian court, Sasan's daughter later married Papak and bore him Ardashir. Furthermore, the Bundahishn states that Sasan was the son of a certain Weh-afrid. Politics of the Sasanian family The political ambition of Sasan was evoked by the troubles and weakness of the last years of the Parthian empire. According to Tabari, Papak managed to consolidate his power with the help of his own sons Shapur and Ardashir. This is considered the beginning of the Sasanian dynasty. Sasan's family became the rulers of the second Persian Empire and ruled over a great portion of western Asia (the first Persian Empire having been ruled by the dynasty of Cyrus the Great). The three founders of this new empire ‚Äì that is, Papak and his two sons ‚Äì are depicted and mentioned on the wall of the harem of Xerxes at Persepolis, a remnant site of the Achaemenids, a representation suggested to be the evidence of a claim to Achaemenid heritage likely later added. Sasan is known for his efforts to try to bring Zoroastrianism back into the empire. He even encouraged Papak to take over the Parthian satrapy of Pars.

Involvement in the Free Officers Movement  His relationship with Gamal Abdel Nasser began when he lived in the same building that Gamal Abdel Nasser inhabited in Abbasiya before the July 23 movement. They had family relations, and in addition to being officers teachers in the School of Administrative Affairs and they met on a daily basis, Jamal Abdel Nasser opened it to the Free Officers in 1951, and Al- Shazly welcomed the idea and joined them, but he did not participate in the night of July 23, 1952 directly, as he was in a college course Pillars of the war.  Airborne Corps  At the rank of major, he traveled to the United States of America on an advanced training mission in 1953 specialized in parachutes and was one of the first officers to receive the Rangers School course. Then he became the commander of the 75th Parachute Battalion during the Triple Aggression of 1956. He took command of the Parachute Force during the period from 1954 to 1959. During the celebrations of the Revolution Day, which was to be held on July 23, 1954, Al-Shazly suggested to Major General Naguib Ghoneim, the commander of the Cairo military region, to show the parachute corps differently from the rest of the armed forces units that were walking in the normal step in front of the podium, as is well known. He suggested that the parachute corps parade walk By a quick step in front of the podium, and by that he was the first to suggest walking in a quick step in the special military parades for the paratroopers, which became associated with the thunderbolt and paratroop forces and what distinguished them from other forces and were subsequently transferred by the Arab countries.  UN Mission in Congo  In 1960 (during of unity with Syria) President Gamal Abdel Nasser, sent a parachute battalion as part of the United Nations forces to the Congo, led by Colonel Al Shazly, at the request of Prime Minister Lumumba and in coordination with the United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, to maintain security and law and with the aim of preventing Belgium from returning to an occupation His country, which became independent on June 30, 1960. The Arab Parachute battalion was made up of 5 companies (4 companies from Egypt and one from Syria), which got the name 'the Arab battalion in the Congo'. The battalion was stationed in the far north, more than 1,200 kilometers from the capital. It was the first Arab force sent to carry out foreign missions under the leadership of the United Nations. Events developed and General Staff chief Mobutu Ceseiseko led a military coup that controlled the country. Lumumba managed to escape, but he was arrested and killed in January 1961. Then Gamal Abdel Nasser sent a military committee headed by Brigadier Ahmed Ismail Ali to the Congo to study what Egypt could offer to advance the Congolese army, but the situation had changed. The new government was eradicating hostility to Gamal Abdel Nasser and demanding the return of the Arab forces. During that period, the dispute occurred between Colonel Al- Shazly and Colonel Ahmed Ismail Ali. After the killing of Lumumba, Al-Shazly felt dangerous and decided unilaterally to leak his soldiers from their positions. He also secured the smuggling of Lumumba's sons to Egypt before the Egyptian battalion withdrew.  Six Day War (1967)  During the Six-Day War, Shazly showed great merit and tactical awareness. He was positioned in the middle of Sinai with a mixed unit of one infantry battalion, two Sa'ka (Thunderbolt) battalions, and one tank battalion. Following the initial air raid and subsequent superiority of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), the Egyptian command had given a chaotic order for all of its troops to retreat westward which would cause most of them to be mopped by the IAF, especially after most communications were lost between the troops and the Egyptian command; Shazly, however, took the most unbelievable of chances and headed eastward through thin passages, invading Israel itself. He eventually positioned himself in the Negev desert, behind most enemy lines. This feat would have made him one of the few Arab generals to ever successfully take and hold territory inside Israel. He stayed there with his battalions under the cover of two mountains to avoid IAF bombing for two days, the 6th and 7th of June. Finally, he succeeded in making contact with the Egyptian command which ordered him to immediately retreat west of the Suez Canal. He responded with one of the most difficult maneuvers executed in the history of the Egyptian‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, a night march (with mechanized units and tanks accompanying) in the desert and through enemy lines. His unit managed to cover about 60 miles of ground throughout the Sinai, without any air support or intelligence. As dawn broke, the column was spotted by Israeli aircraft, which made low-level passes, bombing and strafing his forces. Lacking anti-aircraft weaponry, his forces could only reply with machine gun and small arms fire. Over 100 of his troops were killed, but the Israeli planes eventually went off in search of other targets, and his column drove on, managing to avoid Israeli ground forces and reaching the Suez Canal.https://www.warhistoryonline.com/guest- bloggers/egyptian-unit-escaped-destruction-1967-invading-israel-m.html He was then the last military commander to pass from the east of the canal to the west. In the later years, he was highly respected within the Egyptian military for his feats and was eventually granted the command of the combined paratroopers and Sa'ka Forces from which he would move on to be the chief of staff of the Egyptian army and play a major role in the Egyptian major offensive in 1973.  Commander of the Red Sea Military Region  During the War of Attrition, Israel was conducting lightning raids on the Red Sea region and daily kidnappings of civilians and the destruction of installations on the Red Sea coasts culminating in the incident of Zafarana on September 9, 1969. Gamal Abdel Nasser saw that General Al-Shazly was the most suitable person who could stop Israel's incursions into the Red Sea region and secure the area and appointed him commander of the Red Sea Military Region in 1970, and General Al-Shazly managed to stop the daily kidnappings that were taking place against civilians and employees who were taken as prisoners by the Israeli forces During that period, he was able to stop the Israeli attacks.  Shedwan Incident (Operation Rhodes)  On January 22, 1970, Israel attacked the Red Sea island of Shedwan, near the entrance to the Gulf of Suez, 35 kilometers from Hurghada and 325 kilometers from Suez, and it had a lighthouse to guide ships and a marine radar, secured by an Egyptian thunderbolt,its military importance is purely because it is an uninhabited rocky island and its area does not exceed 60 square kilometers. The Israeli forces bombed the island by air and followed it with the landing of the soldiers by helicopter and the landing boats in an attempt to occupy it, and a small garrison of the Egyptian thunderbolt withstood a huge Israeli fire, and the Israelis had announced on the evening of the first fighting night that their forces \\"find no resistance on the island\\" except They came back and confessed at three in the afternoon the next day that fighting was still going on on the island. Maj. Gen. Al- Shazly ordered the attack of the island with the help of a number of fishermen from the governorate, which resulted in the transfer of soldiers and equipment in the dark to Shedwan Island to attack the Israeli forces.  Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces  On May 16, 1971, after President Anwar Sadat ousted the poles of the Nasser regime, in what he called the correction revolution, he appointed Al-Shazly as chief of staff of the Egyptian armed forces, as he was not affiliated with any of the wrestlers on the Egyptian political scene at the time, and for his competence, his military ability, and his rich background he gained from his studies between the United States of America and the Soviet Union in military sciences as well as his long military career.  Dispute with LT General Muhammad Sadiq  When Al-Shazly was appointed as Chief of Staff of the Egyptian armed forces, the Minister of War and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces at the time was Lieutenant General Muhammad Sadiq, with whom he entered into disagreements over the operational plan for the liberation of Sinai. The LT Gen. Muhammad Sadiq was the first to see that the Egyptian Army should not undertake any offensive operation unless it has reached a stage that surpasses the enemy in the equipment and combat efficiency of its soldiers, only then can it carry out a massive offensive operation that destroys Israeli forces in the Sinai and advances to the straits and from there to Gaza. Al-Shazly's response to his proposals was that he would like this, but this opinion is not in line with the actual capabilities of the armed forces for the weakness of the air force and the lack of a mobile air defense that protects the advanced forces. Al-Shazly started to develop an offensive plan according to the capabilities of the armed forces, which required the recovery of 10 to 12 km in the depth of Sinai. He built his opinion that it is important to tailor the war strategy to your capabilities and according to the capabilities of the enemy. However, the LT General, Muhammad Ahmad Sadiq, opposed the plan on the pretext that it does not achieve any political or military goal. From the political point of view, it will achieve nothing and 60,000 square kilometers of Sinai will remain under Israeli control, but militarily it will create for the Egyptian army a difficult position instead of the current position. Which depends on the Suez Canal as a natural barrier, while the transportation lines through the bridges erected in the canal will be at the mercy of the Israeli air force. After lengthy discussions between Al-Shazly and Muhammwd Sadiq, Al-Shazly reached a compromise, which is the preparation of two plans, the first aimed at occupying the Straits, which he called Operation 41 and the second aimed at seizing the Bar Lev Line and called it the Operation Badr, but Muhammad Ahmed Sadiq, was not convinced and from his point of view that Egypt will not tolerate another defeat. On October 26, 1972, Anwar Sadat dismissed Lieutenant General Muhammad Sadiq of the Ministry of War for his disagreement with his vision of liberating the land, his conviction to see Al-Shazly and appointed Field Marshal Ahmed Ismail Ali as Minister of War and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, who had been referred for retirement in the late days of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who showed him Al-Shazly has old differences, but they committed themselves to working with each other to prepare for the October war.  Dispute with Ahmed Ismail Ali  Colonel Al-Shazly and Colonel Ahmed Ismail Ali coincided with the presence in the Congo in 1960, during which Ahmed Ismail attempted to impose his administrative and military domination on Al-Shazly by virtue of his higher military rank, despite their different tasks and two references. Al-Shazly rejected this logic, and both exchanged rough words until they almost reached the hands clash. After the leadership in Cairo learned about this, the committee called up and the conflict ended, but its effects remained in the depths of both of them. After the return of Al-Shazly from the Congo, there was no direct contact between them as Ahmed Ismail was in the infantry while Al-Shazly was in the parachute corps. On March 10, 1969, Al-Shazly was surprised by the appointment of Ahmed Ismail as the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces after the killing of Lieutenant-General Abdel Moniem Riad on March 9, 1969). Al-Shazly submitted his resignation to the office of the Minister of War, Muhammad Fawzi. Considering that Ahmed Ismail will contact him again through the new position, but President Gamal Abdel Nasser intervened and sent his son-in-law, Ashraf Marwan, to El-Shazly, where he persuaded him to return to work after he confirmed to him President Gamal Abdel Nasser‚Äôs promise not to contact Ahmed Ismail with him. Indeed, Ahmed Ismail did not set foot during the six months he spent as chief of staff at the Inshas base, in which Al-Shazly worked as commander of the Special Forces (Thunderbolts and Paratroopers) until Ahmed Ismail was referred to retirement by order of President Gamal Abdel Nasser on September 9, 1969, following the incident of the Israeli raid on Zafarana in the Gulf of Suez. On October 26, 1972, President Anwar Sadat dismissed Lieutenant General Mohamed Ahmed Sadiq for their disagreement over the transit plan. He appointed Ahmed Ismail, the Minister of War and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and before that he had been recalled from the pension and appointed by President Anwar Sadat as Director of General Intelligence on May 15, 1971, President Anwar offered Sadat came to Al-Shazly, and it was a bad surprise for him. He told the president the long history of their differences, which makes cooperation between them almost impossible. But President Anwar Sadat assured him that the relationship between them would be good and much better than the previous relationship between him and LT General, Muhammad Sadiq. Al-Shazly then considered resignation, but two factors prevented him, the first of which is that his resignation will be interpreted as solidarity with Muhammad Sadiq after the president's sacking, and the second is that some may explain his resignation that he does not want to enter the war when the truth is the opposite.  High Minarets Plan \\"Operation Badr\\"  This is the plan developed by Al-Shazly to attack the Israeli forces and storm the Suez Canal in August 1971, which he called the \\"High Minarets\\" plan: This plan was drawn up due to the weakness of the Egyptian Air Force and the weak capabilities in the Egyptian Air Defense Command, which prevents a major offensive operation. However, a limited operation can be carried out to cross the Suez Canal, destroy the Barlev Line and occupy 10 to 12 kilometers east of the canal, which is the maximum range of Egyptian air defense, and then switch to take defensive positions. The philosophy of this plan was that Israel has two weaknesses: The first is the inability to withstand human losses due to the small number of its members. The second is to prolong the duration of the war. In all previous wars, it depended on lightning wars that ended within four or six weeks at the most. Because during this period it mobilizes 18% of the Israeli people and this is a very high percentage. Moreover, the economic situation will be severely affected in Israel due to the interruption of education, agriculture and industry. Because most of those who work in these institutions are ultimately officers and soldiers in the Israeli armed forces. The plan had two other dimensions in terms of depriving Israel of its most important combat advantages: The first: denying him the attack from the sides because the sides of the Egyptian army will be based on the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and on the Gulf of Suez in the south, and will not be able to attack from the rear, which will be the Suez Canal, then he will have to attack in front of it, and then he will pay the heavy price. The second: The enemy has an important advantage in the confrontational battles, which is the rapid air support of its armored elements, whereby the Western combat doctrine under which Israel operates at the lowest levels of the commanders allows the use of air support, which will lose it because the Egyptian forces will be in the protection of the Egyptian air defense, and from Here, the process of neutralizing Israeli aviation takes place during the battle.  Announcement 41  Lieutenant General Saad El-Shazly, Chief of Staff of the Egyptian Armed Forces (41) issued a directive clarifying the manner in which soldiers perform their combat duties during the October 1973 war. Guidance 41 is what was implemented in October war operations, and the plan succeeded with overwhelming success. This directive started by placing all problems and difficulties in front of the Egyptian plan to cross the canal and destroy the Bar Lev Line, and the working group had to set solutions to each problem. It was the most complex problem that the group met with was the earthen embankment on the east bank of the canal, which gave the Israeli side the advantage of controlling the fire, and the remark against the forces crossing, and this led to the suggestion of the need to build high strong points equipped with terraces of tanks on the West Bank of the Suez Canal, allowing the Egyptian side to secure its forces that cross the channel with fire and information. LT Gen. Al-Shazly had to collect the combat experience from the Egyptian forces ‚Äôactions and lessons learned immediately after the event, and it will be distributed to members of the armed forces to benefit from them in any future similar operations, for example, guidance for securing radars in isolated areas after the raid Israeli on one of the isolated radars in Zafarana, and thinking began to issue that directive when the Al-Shazly team was reviewing the offensive operation plan to storm the Suez Canal and destroy the Bar Lev Line, and it was found that there are many problems that hinder and affect the planning of the offensive operation. He ordered his formation of a special committee to prepare this directive as a method for the war plan. After completing this directive, he became the detailed plan for crossing the Suez Canal and storming the Barlev line of the armed forces entirely. In mid-1973, a few months before the war, Al-Shazly team visited the College of Leaders and Staff and began discussion with students from eight in the morning until seven in the evening. The discussion was completed in two days. This guidance included a detailed plan for the transit of forces; Starting with the number of soldiers in each boat and the arming of each soldier and the size of the ammunition he carries either for himself or for the supporting forces, and the matter reached the timing of the entry of transit equipment to the canal area from rubber boats to bridges equipment and method of protection and locations of smoke generators and air defense etc. The guidance focused on every very subtle detail and left leaders with only careful execution.  October War (1973)  Lieutenant General Shazly during the October War The Israeli army previously made a defensive line called Bar Lev Line that was strengthened with several fortresses at the eastern bank of the Suez canal that is separating the Israeli army from the Egyptian one. it also built a sand barrier 17 meters high at the canal shores to refrain any attempt to cross the canal by the Egyptian army. At 2 pm 6 October 1973, under General Shazly's command, 200 Egyptian aircraft skimmed low over the canal, headed deep into Sinai and struck the Israeli key forces, while 2000 artillery pieces opened heavy bombardment on the Bar-Lev forts and minefields, under which cover engineer reconnaissance teams paddled over to check the outlets for the Israeli inflammable liquid had been blocked from the night before. The first assault wave of 4000 men crossed the Suez Canal and opened 70 passages through the sand barrier using high pressure water pumps. Waves of infantry followed crossing the Canal and captured most of the strong points and forts of the Ber lev line. On the next day, 7 October, 5 bridges were assembled over the canal, and the armored divisions began to cross the canal into Sinai. On 8 October, the Israeli counter-attack failed to push the Egyptians back, Israel tried again on 9 October but also suffered heavy losses. Israel lost more than 260 tanks in two days. After that initial victory, Shazly clashed with president Sadat over Sadat's decision to launch a new offensive to advance towards Sinai Passages. General Shazly strongly opposed any eastward advance that would leave Egyptian forces exposed to IAF without adequate air cover. Sadat insisted and ordered the generals to execute the order which aimed at helping the Syrians. On October 14th, the offensive was launched but failed with heavy Egyptian losses. This may have contributed to the success of a daring Israeli operation which pushed its way west in between Egypt's second and third armies and crossed from Sinai into mainland Egypt through the Bitter Lakes. Once again president Sadat refused General Shazly's plan to move some of the Egyptian's armored brigades to fight the Israeli troops. Legacy After leaving the army Shazly wrote his account of the 1973 war.* After the 25 of January revolution in 2011 and removal of Mubarak from the Egyptian government, Shazly was honored by putting his name on the Egyptian Military Academy graduates of the year 2013.http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/314737.aspx al-Ahram newspaper 28 February 2013 He was awarded the Order of the Nile, Egypt's highest award, in October 2012 by President Mohammed Morsi for his conduct during the 1973 war with Israel.

During the war, she married Rhode Island Governor William Sprague. She was the daughter of Ohio politician Salmon P. Chase, who served as Treasury Secretary during President Abraham Lincoln's first administration and later Chief Justice of the United States. She was a strong supporter of her widowed father's presidential ambitions which, had he been successful, would have made her First Lady.  Early life  Kate was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the daughter of Salmon Chase and his second wife Eliza Ann Smith. Eliza Chase died shortly after Kate's fifth birthday; Chase later married Sara Bella Ludlow with whom Kate had a difficult relationship. Kate Chase was educated at the Haines School in New York City, where she learned languages, elocution and the social graces along with music and history. After nine years of schooling, she returned to Columbus, Ohio, to serve as official hostess for her father, the newly elected Governor of Ohio, and by now widowed a third time. Beautiful and intelligent, Kate impressed such friends of her father as Charles Sumner, a Massachusetts senator and fellow anti-slavery champion; future President James Garfield; and Carl Schurz, a German-born American politician, who described her as follows: > She was about eighteen years old, tall and slender and exceedingly well > formed. . . . Her little nose, somewhat audaciously tipped up, could perhaps > not have passed muster with a severe critic, but it fitted pleasingly into > her face with its large, languid, but at the same time vivacious hazel eyes, > shaded by long dark lashes and arched over by proud eyebrows. The fine > forehead was framed in waving, gold-brown hair. She had something imperial > in the pose of the head, and all her movements possessed an exquisite > natural charm. No wonder that she came to be admired as a great beauty and > broke many hearts. After the usual commonplaces, the conversation at the > breakfast table, in which Miss Kate took a lively and remarkably intelligent > part, soon turned itself upon politics.  Life in Washington  Kate Chase, circa 1861Union General J.J. Abercrombie and Kate Chase Sprague, circa 1863 In 1861, Salmon P. Chase became Secretary of the Treasury in Lincoln's administration. He set up residence at 6th and E Streets Northwest in Washington, with Kate Chase as his hostess. Her soirees were eagerly attended in the nation's capital; she became, effectively, the \\"Belle of the North.\\" She visited battle camps in the Washington area and befriended Union generals, offering her own views on the proper prosecution of the war, often contrary to the wishes of the administration.  Marriage and divorce  Kate and William Sprague She married Rhode Island Governor William Sprague, a textile magnate, on November 12, 1863 (the social event of the season) at Chase's home in Washington. Sprague's wedding gift to her was a tiara of matched pearls and diamonds that cost more than $50,000. As the bride entered the room, the U.S. Marine Band played \\"The Kate Chase March\\" that composer Thomas Mark Clark had written for the occasion. President Lincoln attended the reception, but his wife, who strongly disliked both of the Chases, did not. They had four children: William (b. 1865), Ethel (b. 1869), Catherine (b. 1872) and Portia (b. 1873).Lori Salotto, \\"William Sprague Papers\\", Rhode Island Historical Society, Jun 2000, accessed 2 Sep 2008 Sprague had problems with alcohol, had affairs with other women, and lost huge sums of money in poorly conceived business ventures. Some evidence suggests that he engaged in illegal cotton trading during the war.

Stuart Dean Brandes, Warhogs: A History of War Profits in America, 1997, pages 92 to 93Mary R. Bullard, Cumberland Island: A History, 2005, page 156 Sprague was elected a U.S. Senator in 1863. During the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, presided over by Chief Justice Salmon Chase, Sprague kept his intentions to himself, but ended up voting with most Republican senators for conviction. This may have furthered his rift with Kate, whose father's chances for the 1868 Republican Presidential nomination would have been damaged had Johnson been removed from office. Next in line to the Presidency, under the law at the time, was radical Republican President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate Benjamin Wade, who could have then run as an incumbent. Johnson was acquitted by a single vote. The marriage ended in divorce in 1882. Before the divorce, Kate was accused of having an affair with the flamboyant and powerful New York Senator Roscoe Conkling. According to a well-known story, buttressed by contemporaneous press reports, Sprague confronted the philandering couple at Sprague's Rhode Island summer home and pursued Conkling with a shotgun and threatened to throw Kate out of a second story window. The shotgun incident with Conkling happened in 1879, but Kate was suspected of infidelities at least 10 years earlier. According to Salmon Chase biographer John Niven, \\"Whether [Kate's second] child...was Sprague's or had been conceived by another is a matter of speculation.\\"Nevin, John ( 1995). Salmon P. Chase. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 443. Willie Sprague continued to live with his father, while the daughters went with Kate Chase, who took back her maiden name after the divorce. Willie died at age 25 in a Seattle boarding house. He had already been through one marriage and divorce. His wife gave birth to a child of questionable lineage only six months after they were married.Leigh, Philip (2015). Lee's Lost Dispatch and Other Civil War Controversies. Yardley, Penna.: Westholme Publishing. p. 75.  Political action  Kate worked behind the scenes to foster her father's calculated efforts to wrest the 1864 Republican Party nomination for President from Lincoln, but the plot blew up in Chase's face when it became public, requiring Chase to settle back into his Treasury Secretary position. One of Chase's many perfunctory offers of resignation from the Cabinet was accepted by Lincoln (much to Chase's surprise and consternation) in 1864, but the President appointed Chase Chief Justice upon the death of Roger Taney that year. The evidence conflicts as to whether Kate welcomed this prestigious appointment or rued it as an attempt to put her father \\"on the shelf\\" so as to preempt any hope of his attaining his most-cherished ambition for the highest office in the land. Despite his position on the Supreme Court, Chase let it be known in 1868 that he was available as a candidate for the Presidency. He switched parties from the Republicans (of whom he had been an important early member) to the Democrats, hoping they would nominate him. In the summer of 1868, Kate ran her father's campaign for the Democratic nomination from their hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where the convention was being held in famed Tammany Hall. Although tradition prevented her appearance, as a woman, on the convention floor, she did much of the back-room maneuvering with the goal of winning the nomination after the first ballot. At times the prize seemed within their grasp, but the convention ended up nominating Horatio Seymour, the Democratic Governor of New York, whom Kate and other Chase operatives had been counting on to place her father's name in nomination. Kate placed the blame for the defeat on a conspiracy of New York politicians including Samuel Tilden. Kate wrote her father after the convention, \\"You have been most cruelly deceived and shamefully used by the man [Tilden] whom you trusted implicitly and the country must suffer for his duplicity.\\" Kate would reputedly have her revenge on Tilden eight years later when her paramour Conkling, the most powerful member of the Senate, maneuvered to throw the disputed 1876 election to the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes over the Democrat Tilden, who had won the popular vote. Chase would make one final bid for the presidency in 1872, with Kate's full support, but by then he was physically weakened and a political has-been; he ran as a Liberal Republican, challenging the incumbent Ulysses S. Grant. The effort went nowhere and Chase died a year later, with Kate (and Sprague, her husband in name only) at his bedside.  Later years  In 1873, following her father's death, Kate moved onto the \\"Edgewood\\" estate, which later became the neighborhood of Edgewood, Washington, D.C.; her father had purchased the bulk of the estate in 1863 and constructed a mansion on it. She lived a very quiet life with her three daughters (according to the 1880 federal census), Ethel, Kitty, and Portia Sprague. After her son Willie committed suicide in 1890, at the age of 25,Lamphier, Peg A. (2003). Kate Chase and William Sprague: Politics and Gender in a Civil War Marriage. U of Nebraska Press. p. 232. . Kate became a recluse. She eventually lost her fortune and, to get by, resorted to raising chickens, growing vegetables and selling them door to door. She died in poverty in 1899, at age 58, of Bright's disease and was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio. On her death, The New York Times wrote that \\"the homage of the most eminent men in the country was hers.\\" The Washington Post called her \\"the most brilliant woman of her day. None outshone her.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer, the paper of her birthplace, said about her funeral: > Hardly more than two or three‚Äîand they the nearest relatives on earth‚Äîwere > gathered together yesterday morning around the new-made grave in Spring > Grove Cemetery, where, with the simple ceremony of commitment‚Äî\\"Dust to dust, > ashes to ashes\\"‚Äîthe mortal remains of the daughter of Salmon P. Chase were > laid to rest forever beside the dust of her illustrious father. And yet, The Enquirer recognized her legacy: \\"No Queen has ever reigned under the Stars and Stripes, but this remarkable woman came closer to being Queen than any American woman has.\\" Fictional portrayals Kate Chase's presence in Washington, D.C. would be fictionally recreated in the 1990s TV series The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. She is prominent in both Gore Vidal's historical novel Lincoln and William Safire's Freedom and is portrayed by Deborah Adair in the 1988 made-for-TV movie of Vidal's book.Lincoln TV movie, IMDb page Chase has also been featured in other Civil War-related novels, such as Stephen L.

His name means \\"nourished by Jupiter\\". As Raymond E. Brown comments, \\"Diotrephes is not a particularly common name.\\"Raymond E. Brown, An Introduction to the New Testament (New York: Doubleday, 1997), p. 403 In addition to being ambitious, proud, disrespectful of apostolic authority, rebellious, and inhospitable, the author of the letter says that Diotrephes tried to hinder those desiring to show hospitality to the brothers and to expel these from the congregation. Not even the location of Diotrephes' church can be determined from the letter. It is debatable whether the antipathy expressed in 3 John is based on \\"a theological dispute, a clash of competing ecclesiastical authorities, a disagreement about financial responsibilities for the mission, or personal dislike\\".Margaret M. Mitchell, \\"'Diotrephes Does Not Receive Us;: The Lexicographical and Social Context of 3 John 9-10,\\" Journal of Biblical Literature 117.2 (1998:299-320), with bibliography of the conflict on each possible arena of the conflict Adolf von Harnack was of the view that Diotrephes was the earliest monarchical bishop whose name has survived.Harnack, \\"√úber den dritten Johannesbrief\\" (series Texte und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur) 15.3 (Leipzig 1897:3-27). Biblical passage The following is the passage and notes from the New English Translation. 1:9 I wrote something to the church,sn The church mentioned here, which the author says he may visit (3 John 10) is not the same as the one mentioned in 3 John 6, to which the author apparently belongs (or of which he is in charge). But what is the relationship of this church in v. 9 to Gaius, to whom the letter is addressed? It is sometimes suggested that Gaius belongs to this church, but that seems unlikely, because the author uses a third-person pronoun to refer to the other members of the church (among them). If Gaius were one of these it would have been much more natural to use a second-person pronoun: ‚ÄúDiotrephes, who loves to be first among you.‚Äù Thus it seems probable that Gaius belongs to (or is in charge of) one local church while Diotrephes is in another, a church known to Gaius but to which he does not belong. but Diotrephes,sn Diotrephes appears to be an influential person (perhaps the leader) in a local church known to Gaius, but to which Gaius himself does not belong. The description of Diotrephes as one who loves to be first suggests he is arrogant, and his behavior displays this: He refuses to acknowledge the written communication mentioned by the author at the beginning of v. 9 (and thus did not recognize the author‚Äôs apostolic authority), and furthermore (v. 10) refuses to show any hospitality to the traveling missionaries (welcome the brothers) already mentioned by the author. It has been suggested that the description ‚Äúloves to be first‚Äù only indicates that Diotrephes sought prominence or position in this church, and had not yet attained any real authority. But his actions here suggest otherwise: He is able to refuse or ignore the author‚Äôs previous written instructions (v. 9), and he is able to have other people put out of the church for showing hospitality to the traveling missionaries (v. 10). who loves to be first among them, does not acknowledge us.tn Since the verb ·ºêœÄŒπŒ¥Œ≠œáŒøŒºŒ±Œπ (epidechomai) can mean ‚Äúreceive into one‚Äôs presence‚Äù (BDAG 370 s.v. 1; it is used with this meaning in the next verse) it has been suggested that the author himself attempted a previous visit to Diotrephes‚Äô church but was turned away. There is nothing in the context to suggest an unsuccessful prior visit by the author, however; in 3 John 9 he explicitly indicates a prior written communication which Diotrephes apparently ignored or suppressed. The verb ·ºêœÄŒπŒ¥Œ≠œáŒøŒºŒ±Œπ can also mean ‚Äúaccept‚Äù in the sense of ‚Äúacknowledge someone‚Äôs authority‚Äù (BDAG 370 s.v. 2) and such a meaning better fits the context here: Diotrephes has not accepted but instead rejected the authority of the author to intervene in the situation of the traveling missionaries (perhaps because Diotrephes believed the author had no local jurisdiction in the matter). 1:10 Therefore, if I come,tn The third-class condition (·ºê·Ω∞ŒΩ ·ºîŒªŒ∏œâ, ean elth≈ç) seems to be used by the author to indicate real uncertainty on his part as to whether he will visit Diotrephes‚Äô church or not. I will call attention to the deeds he is doingsn Because Diotrephes did not recognize the authority of the author, the author will expose his behavior for what it is (call attention to the deeds he is doing) if he comes for a visit. These are the charges the author will make against Diotrephes before the church: (1) Diotrephes is engaged in spreading unjustified charges against the author with evil words; (2) Diotrephes refuses to welcome the brothers (the traveling missionaries) himself; (3) Diotrephes hinders the others in the church who wish to help the missionaries; and (4) Diotrephes expels from the church (throws them out) people who aid the missionaries. (Diotrephes himself may not have had supreme authority in the local church to expel these people, but may have been responsible for instigating collective action against them.) ‚Äì the bringing of unjustified charges against us with evil words! And not being content with that, he not only refuses to welcome the brothers himself, but hinders the people who want to do so and throws them out of the church! 1:11 Dear friend, do not imitate what is bad but what is good.sn The exhortation do not imitate what is bad but what is good is clearly a reference to Diotrephes‚Äô evil behavior. The author exhorts Gaius (whom he wishes to continue assisting the missionaries) not to follow the negative example of Diotrephes, but to do what is right. Implicitly there may be a contrast between the bad behavior of Diotrephes and the good reputation of Demetrius (mentioned in the following verse); but it seems more likely that Demetrius is himself one of the traveling missionaries (perhaps their leader), rather than the leader of a local congregation who, unlike Diotrephes, has supported the missionaries himself. The one who does good is of God; the one who does what is bad has not seen God.sn The statement The one who does what is bad has not seen God is asyndetic; its abrupt introduction adds emphasis. The statement reiterates the common Johannine theme of behavior as an indication of genuine faith, found in 1 John in 3:6, 10; 4:7, 20; and in the Gospel of John in 3:17-21. By implication, the genuineness of Diotrephes‚Äô faith is called into question, because he has obviously done what is bad (v. 11b; cf. vv. 9-10). In John‚Äôs terminology it is clear that the phrase has not seen God is equivalent to ‚Äúis not a genuine Christian‚Äù (see John 3:17-21 and 1 John 3:6, 10; 4:7, 20).

Calv√© was probably the most famous French female opera singer of the Belle √âpoque. Hers was an international career, and she sang regularly at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, and the Royal Opera House, London. Early life Calv√© was born on 15 August 1858 in Decazeville, Aveyron. Her birth name was Rosa Emma Calvet. Her father, Justin Calvet, was a civil engineer. She spent her childhood at first in Spain with her parents, then in different convent schools in Roquefort and Tournemire (Aveyron). After her parents separated, she moved with her mother to Paris. There she attempted to enter the Paris Conservatory, while she studied singing under Jules Puget. She started learning music in Paris from Mathilde Marchesi, a retired German mezzo-soprano and Manuel Garc√≠a. She made a tour of Italy, where she saw the famous actress Eleonora Duse, whose impersonations made a deep impression on the young singer. She trained herself in stage craft and gesture by closely observing Duse's performances. Career Massenet's Sapho, Op√©ra-Comique, Paris, November 27, 1897 She made her operatic debut on 23 September 1881 in Gounod's Faust at Brussels' La Monnaie. Later she sang at La Scala in Milan, and also at the principal theatres of Naples, Rome, and Florence. Returning to Paris in 1891, she created the part of Suzel in L'amico Fritz by Pietro Mascagni, playing and singing the role later at Rome. Because of her great success in it, she was chosen to appear as Santuzza in the French premiere of Cavalleria rusticana, which was viewed as one of her greatest parts. She repeated her success in it in London. In 1892, she spent 6 months in Rome, studying under Mustafa, the last castrato Head of the Sistine Chapel Choir, adding half an octave to the top of her range. Emma Calv√© (1895) Her next triumph was Bizet's Carmen. Before beginning the study of this part, she went to Spain, learned the Spanish dances, mingled with the people and patterned her characterization after the cigarette girls whom she watched at their work and at play. In 1894, she made her appearance in the role at the Op√©ra- Comique, Paris. The city's opera-goers immediately hailed her as the greatest Carmen that had ever appeared, a verdict other cities would later echo. She had had many famous predecessors in the role, including Adelina Patti, Minnie Hauk and C√©lestine Galli-Mari√©, but critics and musicians agreed that in Calv√© they had found their ideal of Bizet's cigarette girl of Seville. Poster of Calv√© in La Navarraise Calv√© first appeared in America in the season of 1893‚Äì1894 as Mignon. She would make regular visits to the country, both in grand opera and in concert tours. After making her Metropolitan Opera debut as Santuzza, she went on to appear a total of 261 times with the company between 1893 and 1904. She created the part of Anita, which was written for her, in Massenet's La Navarraise in London in 1894 and, in 1897, sang Sapho in an opera written by the same composer. She sang Oph√©lie in Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet in Paris in 1899, but the part was not suited to her and she dropped it. She appeared with success in many roles, among them, as the Countess in The Marriage of Figaro, the title role in F√©licien David's Lalla-Roukh, as Pamina in The Magic Flute, and as Camille in H√©rold's Zampa, but she is best known as Carmen. Calv√©'s Metropolitan Opera career ended abruptly in 1904, as Irving Kolodin described in his book THE METROPOLITAN OPERA [Knopf 1968]. She was to sing a group of Proven√ßal songs at the Met's Sunday evening concert. Music director Felix Mottl was to accompany her at the piano. \\"As they were about to begin, she turned and asked him to transpose the music a tone lower. When he refused, she walked off the stage and out of the Metropolitan's history. When she reappeared in New York, it was with Hammerstein's company (1907).\\" Calv√© developed an interest in the paranormal and was once engaged to the occult author Jules Bois. In the winter of 1893/1894 the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862‚Äì1947) executed a life-size portrait of her standing full-length in a green-blue dress, wearing an opera cloak of white and gold with a sable edge, clutching American Beauty roses. It is now lost, but a pastel he made of her in March 1894 has been discovered in a London private collection. Slumber song as sung by Mme Calv√©. Published as a supplement to the New York Herald, April 19, 1903. Cover includes photograph of Emma Calv√©. Later life Calv√© died on 6 January 1942 at Montpellier, H√©rault, and is buried in Millau. Her voice is preserved in a number of recordings made between 1902 and 1920. These are available on CD transfers. Influences While performing in Chicago, Calv√©'s only daughter died in a fire accident. This tragic incident had a serious mental toll on her. It was in this period of intense grief that she met Swami Vivekananda, who prevented her from committing suicide & restored back her to her former cheerful form. Calv√© had accompanied Vivekananda as his partner along with Miss Josephine MacLeod, Sir Francis Jules Bois & his wife and Sarah Bernhard while they travelled through Europe & Egypt in 1899-1901. Calv√© wrote of Swami Vivekananda in her autobiography: \\"[He] truly walked with God, a noble being, a saint, a philosopher and a true friend. His influence upon my spiritual life was profound [...] my soul will bear him eternal gratitude\\".Calv√©, Emma (1922). My Life, p. 185 (English translation by Rosamond Gilder). D. Appleton & Company She also visited Belur Math, Swami Vivekananda's tribute to his guru Ramakrishna Paramahansa. She said of this visit and her association with the monks there: \\"The hours that I spent with these gentle philosophers have remained in my memory as a time apart. These beings ‚Äì pure, beautiful and remote seemed to belong to another universe, a better and wiser world\\"Calv√© (1922) p. 194Sri Ma Darshan in Bengali by Swami Nityatmananda, volume 3, pp. 47‚Äì48 Swami Vivekananda wrote of Calv√©: > She was born poor but by her innate talents, prodigious labour and > diligence, and after wrestling against much hardship, she is now enormously > rich and commands respect from kings and emperors....The rare combination of > beauty, youth, talents, and \\"divine\\" voice has assigned Calve the highest > place among the singers of the West. There is, indeed, no better teacher > than misery and poverty. That constant fight against the dire poverty, > misery, and hardship of the days of her girlhood, which has led to her > present triumph over them, has brought into her life a unique sympathy and a > depth of thought with a wide outlook.

It is a popular climbing route. Geography The stack is composed of Torridonian sandstone, and is high. It is in The Minch, a strait in north-west Scotland, separating the north-west Highlands and the northern Inner Hebrides from Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides. Access is normally from the Stoer Head Lighthouse, which is within walking distance of the stack. The lighthouse is on the B869 Lochinver to Unapool road. The seas around the Old Man of Stoer have claimed a number of vessels. There is believed to be the wreck of a fishing boat in the vicinity of the stack, which sank on 17 February 1953. Climbing alt=On a rocky outcrop, the top of the stack, is a tangle of ropes and carabiners. The Old Man of Stoer is popular with climbers due to its height and approachability. It was first climbed in 1966 by Brian Henderson, Paul Nunn, Tom Patey, and Brian Robertson.  Along with Am Buachaille and the Old Man of Hoy, it has become something of a legend among climbers. To gain access to the foot of the stack, a Tyrolean traverse is necessary, which may require a swimmer to put it in place. There are a number of routes of varying levels of difficulty. In the Channel 4 television programme Hidden Talent, 45-year-old Maggie Reenan climbed the stack after 18 days of intensive training, after her natural aptitude for climbing was discovered. Wildlife Northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) inhabit the stack and nearby sea cliffs. Other wildlife in the area includes the great skua (also known by its Norse name \\"bonxie\\") peregrines, pinnipeds and cetaceans. Seabirds which can be seen include bonxies, guillemots, fulmars, razorbills and other birds including twite, skylarks, and dunlin.

Coming of the railroad The most significant event in the development of Tacony was the acquisition of land there in 1846 for a ferry-wharf by the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad, which had first laid tracks through the town in 1834, along the route from its depot at modern Frankford Avenue and Montgomery Avenue, Kensington, to Trenton, New Jersey. Banned from traversing the District of Kensington southbound to connect with other rail lines, the Philadelphia and Trenton built Tacony Depot, an important early transportation hub. The depot and the community which grew around it was, for a short time, called Buena Vista, named for the recent Mexican War victory. A waterfront mansion on the property was converted to the Washington House Hotel at the foot of what would become Disston Street. Through passengers traveling from New York de-trained at Tacony and took a steamboat to Walnut Street, where they could connect with stagecoaches and other rail lines. North-bound passengers did the reverse. Steamboats and steam ferries stopped at Tacony several times a day for over eight decades. The railroad's Kensington Depot continued to be used for freight and some passenger traffic, but the steamboat transfer continued until 1867, when the Connecting Railway opened from Frankford Junction to Mantua, near the Philadelphia Zoo, enabling a connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad. Between 1861 and 1865, Tacony Depot was the major conduit for soldiers from New England, New York, and New Jersey traveling to and from the campaigns of the Civil War, greatly adding to the village's name recognition. German-American Catholics formed the Saint Vincent's Orphan Asylum Society in 1855. They purchased from two farmers and William H. Gatzmer's land association, comprising an area from Princeton Avenue to Cottman Avenue, the railroad to the river. They formed the Tacony Cottage Association, and sub- divided the land into building lots which they sold to cover the establishment of St. Vincent‚Äôs Orphanage at the foot of St. Vincent Street. In 1854, the City of Philadelphia consolidated the surrounding county into the city and Tacony became one of its neighborhoods. In 1871, the Philadelphia and Trenton‚Äôs right-of-way was leased to the mammoth Pennsylvania Railroad and became the most important connection in that system, the Philadelphia-to-New York section of today's Northeast Corridor. Ships named for Tacony Three vessels named \\"Tacony\\" saw naval duty, one of them for the South during the Civil War. In 1863, Confederate forces captured the merchant vessel Tacony and used it as a stealth raider, CSS Florida No.2, to capture 15 additional ships. It was burned when the crew upgraded to a larger vessel. A 2004 book, \\"Seawolf of the Confederacy,\\" chronicles its exploits. Also in 1863, a gunboat named Tacony, built at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, was commissioned and saw blockade duty against the South. During World War I, a sizeable yacht owned by industrialist Jacob Disston was donated to the government for the length of the war. It was refitted, armed, and assigned to coastal patrol duty as USS Tacony.  Disston moves to Tacony In 1872, industrialist Henry Disston, seeing, among other things, easy access to river and railroad, purchased in Tacony and moved his growing saw and file manufactory there from cramped quarters in Kensington. (Henry's brother had earlier purchased vacation property from the Cottage Association.) The company became the largest of its kind in the world for a century, employing up to 5,000 workers at one time. A Time magazine article claimed in 1940 that 75 percent of the handsaws sold in the U.S. were made by Disston. West of the railroad, Disston built a paternalistic industrial village which has been the subject of books, academic studies, and Papal and government recognition. Disston is still regarded with reverence in the community and his image figures prominently on a large community mural. Tacony thrived during the industrial age as national and international firms opened branches there. The Tacony Iron Company manufactured the dome of Philadelphia City Hall and the massive statue of William Penn that it supports. In 1894, Frank Shuman, inventor of wire glass and a pioneer in solar power twice featured on the cover of Scientific American built a large inventor's compound on Disston Street and there built the first solar-powered steam engine. From experiments conducted there, he later developed solar-powered steam turbines to irrigate land in Egypt. Tacony Palmyra Bridge The Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, one of only two Delaware River spans connecting New Jersey with northeast Philadelphia (the other being the Betsy Ross Bridge further downstream), has its Pennsylvania terminus in Tacony. The bridge, which carries Pennsylvania Route 73, connects with New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, New Jersey. It opened in 1929, eliminating the need for ferries, used on that route since 1922. Daily use, 50,000 vehicles; 18.25 million per year.

Members who engage in conduct that is considered inappropriate may be counseled privately by elders and congregational responsibilities may be withheld or restricted. If initial counsel is not accepted, elders may present a talk to the congregation about the type of behavior, alerting other members already aware of the individual's conduct to limit social interaction with that person. Hearings involving \\"serious sin\\" are performed by formal judicial committees, in which guilt and repentance are determined by a tribunal of elders. A variety of controls can be enforced, from reproof and restriction of congregational duties to excommunication, known as disfellowshipping, which includes shunning by the congregation. Individuals who are disfellowshipped may be reinstated after an extended period if they are deemed to demonstrate repentance. The practice of disfellowshipping has been criticized by many non-members and ex-members.  Discipline involving non-judicial situations  At the elders' discretion, \\"non-judicial\\" situations may involve discipline of one or more of several types. Counsel Counsel may be given in situations involving actions that are considered inappropriate but are not considered to be of sufficient gravity to necessitate a judicial committee. Counsel may be provided by a mature Witness in addition to self-discipline and family discipline. Elders may also give recommendations or warnings to members in non-judicial situations. Local needs At conventions and assemblies, and about once each month at a local midweek meeting, a short talk regarding \\"local needs\\" is presented.Our Kingdom Ministry, Service meeting schedule, 1992-2009 An elder addresses matters that are relevant to the local congregation, with instructions outlining the course of action considered appropriate. No specific individuals are identified during the talk, but the talk may relate to a matter for which a member has recently been \\"reproved\\". At times, some temporary policy may be announced that might be seen as disciplinary; for example, it may be that an additional attendant is assigned outside a Kingdom Hall to discourage children from running on the sidewalk. Shepherding calls Personal \\"shepherding visits\\" are intended to encourage members of the congregation, though may also include counsel and correction, then or on a subsequent visit. Two elders (or an elder and a ministerial servant) may schedule and perform a particular shepherding visit on their own or at the direction of the body of elders.  Withheld recommendations or assignments  The body of elders may withhold its recommendation for a member to serve in a new position of responsibility, though still permitting existing responsibilities. For example, a ministerial servant who consistently seems insufficiently prepared for his meeting parts may have such assignments withheld for a time, even though he may continue serving as a ministerial servant or in some other \\"special privilege of service\\".  Withheld \\"privileges\\"  An active Jehovah's Witness may have their congregational \\"privileges of service\\" limited, even without having committed a serious sin. While Witnesses sometimes refer to field ministry, after-meeting cleanup, and other responsibilities as \\"privileges\\", the term \\"privileges of service\\" often implies a specific range of assignments assisting elders and ministerial servants with meeting demonstrations and other responsibilities. Such limitations are usually temporary. Elders, ministerial servants, pioneers, or other appointed Witnesses can lose their \\"special privileges of service\\".Jehovah's Witnesses use the term \\"special privileges of service\\" for positions requiring formal appointment or approval, such as elder, ministerial servant, pioneer, Bethel (branch) service, and schools such as Gilead and Ministerial Training School; \\"Make Room for It\\", Our Kingdom Ministry, April 2003, page 1 For example, an elder may be removed or choose to step aside voluntarily from his position if members of his household are not in \\"good standing\\". After resignation or removal from an appointed position, an announcement is made during the congregation's Service Meeting indicating that the person is \\"no longer serving [in that capacity]\\", without elaboration.  Marking  Members who persist in a course considered scripturally wrong after repeated counsel by elders, but who are not considered guilty of something for which they could be disfellowshipped, can be \\"marked\\", based on Jehovah's Witnesses' interpretation of 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15 (NWT): \\"14 But if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter, keep this one marked and stop associating with him, so that he may become ashamed. 15 And yet do not consider him an enemy, but continue admonishing him as a brother.\\" Actions for which an individual may be \\"marked\\" include dating a non-member, dating when not \\"scripturally\\" or legally free to marry, being lazy, critical, or dirty, meddling, taking material advantage of others or indulging in \\"improper\\" entertainment. \\"Marking\\" is indicated by means of a warning talk given to the congregation outlining the shameful course, without explicitly naming any particular individual. Members who know whose actions are being discussed may then consider the individual \\"marked\\". Though not shunned, \\"marked\\" individuals are looked upon as \\"bad association\\" and social interaction outside of formal worship settings is generally curtailed. This action is intended to \\"shame\\" the person into following a particular course of action.https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1985290  Discipline involving \\"serious sin\\"  If an active baptized Witness is considered to have committed a \\"serious sin\\" for which the individual must demonstrate formal repentance, correction (or, \\"discipline\\") is administered by the congregation's body of elders. Such situations usually involve a \\"judicial committee\\" of three or more elders.  List of \\"serious sins\\"  Jehovah's Witnesses consider many actions to be \\"serious sins\\", for which baptized Witnesses are subject to a judicial committee hearing. Such actions include: An individual may also be disfellowshipped for promoting one of the above listed \\"sins\\" without actually engaging in the practice, or for accepting employment related to one of them (e.g. selling lottery tickets, firearms or cigarettes; working in an abortion clinic, church or military base). If a baptized Witness teaches contrary to Witness doctrines, it is considered apostasy and grounds for disfellowshipping. A 1981 letter to overseers‚Äîreproduced in a book by former Governing Body member Raymond Franz‚Äîdirected that a member who \\"persists in believing other doctrine\\", even without promoting such beliefs, may also be subject to disfellowshipping.To All Circuit and District Overseers, September 1, 1980, \\"Keep in mind that to be disfellowshipped, an apostate does not have to be a promoter of apostate views. ... if a baptized Christian abandons the teachings of Jehovah, as presented by the faithful and discreet slave, and persists in believing other doctrine despite Scriptural reproof, then he is apostatizing. ... [If] he continues to believe the apostate ideas and rejects what he has been provided through the 'slave class,' then appropriate judicial action should be taken. ... [If] something reasonably substantial comes to the attention of the elders along this line, it would be appropriate to make a kindly, discreet inquiry so as to protect the flock.\\" Letter reproduced in Crisis of Conscience, Raymond Franz, 1983, chapter 11. Elders usually try to reason with the individual before such action is taken.The Watchtower 6/1/98 p. 19 par. 17 \\"Put Up a Hard Fight for the Faith\\"! If a person believes that a teaching should be adjusted or changed, he is encouraged \\"to be patient and wait on Jehovah for change\\".\\"Show a Waiting Attitude!\\" The Watchtower September 1, 2000 page 11. Retrieved on 2013-02-02.The Watchtower states that \\"apostates are \\"mentally diseased,\\" that they seek to infect others with their disloyal teachings, (1 Timothy 6:3, 4 [NWT]) and \\"to avoid contact with them.\\" (Romans 16:17 [NWT]);\\"Will You Heed Jehovah's Clear Warnings?\\", The Watchtower, July 15, 2011, pages 15 and Some have stated that this applies to all individuals who leave the organization.\\"Jehovah's Witnesses church likens defectors to 'contagious, deadly disease'\\", Sunday Herald Sun, page 39, October 2, 2011. Procedures Evidence for actions that can result in congregational discipline is obtained by voluntary confession to the elders or by witnesses of the violation. A minimum of two witnesses is required to establish guilt, based on their understanding of Deuteronomy 17:6 and Matthew 18:16, unless the person confesses voluntarily.Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock, p. 111 Members are instructed to report serious sins committed by other members.August 15, 1997 Watchtower, p. 27 Failure to report a serious sin of another member is viewed as sharing in the sins of others, a sin before God. Witnesses are instructed that pledges of confidentiality may be broken to report what they believe to be transgressions.\\"A Time to Speak-- When?\\" Watchtower, September 1, 1987, pp. 12-15 A congregation's body of elders considers confessions or credible allegations of serious sin, and decides whether a judicial committee will be formed to address the matter.\\"New Arrangements for Congregation Organization\\", Our Kingdom Ministry, September 1977, pages 5-6 A judicial committee, usually consisting of three elders, investigates the details of the alleged sin further. The committee arranges a formal judicial hearing to determine the circumstances of the sin, whether the accused is repentant, and whether disciplinary actions will be taken.\\"\\"Gifts in Men\\" to Care for Jehovah‚Äôs Sheep\\", The Watchtower, June 1, 1999, page 14\\"Elders, Judge With Righteousness\\", The Watchtower, July 1, 1992, page 16\\"Disfellowshipping‚ÄîA Loving Provision?\\", The Watchtower, July 15, 1995, page 25 In certain situations, a body of elders may handle a situation involving \\"serious sin\\" by a baptized Witness without a judicial committee: * Minor or newly baptized - A minor or newly baptized Witness might commit one or two acts of \\"serious sin\\" involving tobacco or overdrinking;\\"Jehovah‚Äôs Sheep Need Tender Care\\", The Watchtower, January 15, 1996, page 18 repercussions as for 'non-judicial' situations may still be imposed. * Repentance - The body of elders may believe the sinner's repentance has been established and accepted. For example, if a member committed a \\"serious sin\\" several years ago, had formally repented in prayer, and the sin did not involve scheming.\\"Question Box\\", Our Kingdom Ministry, October 1972, page 8 Witnesses are strongly discouraged from waiting years to resolve such matters;\\"Make Wise Use of Your Christian Freedom\\", June 1, 1992, page 19 even if years have passed since the serious sin, it is typical for a judicial committee to be formed, and there may still be repercussions as for ‚Äònon-judicial‚Äô situations. * Judicial abeyance - Elders may become aware of a \\"serious sin\\" committed by a baptized Witness who has been inactive for some time and is not perceived as a Jehovah's Witness. If the alleged sinner is not associating with active Witnesses, the elders may indefinitely postpone a judicial committee and formal hearing unless and until the individual renews their association with the congregation.\\"\\"A Time to Speak\\"‚ÄîWhen?\\", The Watchtower, September 1, 1987, page 14 Judicial committee A person accused of a serious sin is informed of the allegations and invited to attend a judicial committee meeting. The individual is permitted to bring witnesses who can speak in their defense; observers are not allowed,Pay Attention to Yourselves and All the Flock, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1991, page 110-120. and the hearing is held privately even if the accused individual requests that it be heard openly so all may witness the evidence.Raymond Franz, In Search of Christian Freedom, Commentary Press, 2007, page 321.It is unclear whether accused individuals have always had the option to call witnesses. The judicial committee hearing accusations that resulted in the disfellowshipping of Canadian Witness James Penton in February 1981 refused Penton's request to have a lawyer present and to call witnesses. See James A. Beverley, Crisis of Allegiance (Welch Publishing, 1986, page 71). Recording devices are not permitted at the hearing. If the accused repeatedly fails to attend an arranged hearing, the committee will proceed but will not make a decision until evidence and testimony by witnesses are considered. The committee takes the role of prosecutor, judge and jury when handling its cases.M. James Penton, Apocalypse Delayed, University of Toronto Press, 1997, page 89. After the hearing is opened with a prayer, the accused is invited to make a personal statement. If there is no admission of guilt, the individual is informed of the source of the charges and witnesses are presented one at a time to give evidence. Witnesses do not remain present for the entire hearing. Once all the evidence is presented, the accused and all witnesses are dismissed and the committee reviews the evidence and the attitude of the accused. The committee may determine that there was no \\"serious sin\\", or that mitigating circumstances absolve the accused individual. The committee may then proceed with discipline such as is described for 'non-judicial' situations.\\"New Arrangements for Congregation Organization\\", Our Kingdom Ministry, September 1977, page 6 Alternatively, the committee may decide that a serious sin was committed, in which case, the committee gives verbal admonitions and gauges the individual's attitude and repentance. The committee then decides whether discipline will involve formal reproof or disfellowshipping. Reproof Reproof involves actions for which a person could be disfellowshipped, and is said to be an effort to 'reach the heart' and convince a person of the need to hate the sanctioned actionsThe Watchtower 12/1/76 p. 723 par. 15 How Wise Reprovers Aid Erring OnesThe Watchtower 9/1/81 p. 23 par. 9 Repentance Leading Back to God and repent.\\"Imitate Jehovah‚ÄîExercise Justice and Righteousness\\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1998, page 17 Reproof is considered sufficient if the individual is deemed repentant.The Watchtower 9/15/87 p. 13 par. 13The Watchtower 9/1/81 p. 26 par. 23 Repentance Leading Back to God Reproof is given before all who are aware of the transgression. If the conduct is known only to the individual and the judicial committee, reproof is given privately. If the sin is known by a small number, they would be invited by the elders, and reproof would be given before the sinner and those with knowledge of the sin. If the action is known generally by the entire congregation or the wider community, an announcement is made that the person \\"has been reproved\\".The Watchtower 12/1/76 p. 733 par. 14 Giving Reproof \\"Before All Onlookers\\" A related local needs talk may be given, separately to the announcement, without naming anyone. In all cases of reproof, restrictions are imposed, typically prohibiting the individual from sharing in meeting parts, commenting during meetings, and giving group prayers. A reproved Witness cannot enroll as a pioneer or auxiliary pioneer for at least one year after reproof is given.Our Kingdom Ministry March 1983, p. 3. Disfellowshipping All members are expected to abide by the beliefs and moral standards of Jehovah's Witnesses. Serious violations of these requirements can result in disfellowshipping (similar to excommunication) and subsequent shunning if not deemed repentant. When a judicial committee decides that a baptized Witness has committed a serious sin and is unrepentant, the person is disfellowshipped. A person who believes that a serious error in judgment has been made may appeal the decision. Requests for appeal must be made in writing and within seven days of the decision of the judicial committee. Their shunning policy is based on their interpretation of scriptures such as 1 Corinthians 5:11‚Äì13; Matthew 18:15‚Äì17; and 2 John 9‚Äì11. Witness literature states that avoiding interaction with disfellowshipped former adherents helps to: *avoid reproach on God's name and organization by indicating that violations of the Bible's standards in their ranks are not tolerated; *keep the congregation free of possible corrosive influences; and *convince the disfellowshipped individual to re- evaluate their course of action, repent and rejoin the group. Shunning is also practiced when a member formally resigns membership or is deemed to indicate by their actions‚Äîsuch as accepting a blood transfusion or association with another religion or military organization‚Äîthat they do not wish to be known as a Witness. Such individuals are said to have disassociated, and are described by the Watch Tower Society as \\"lawless\\" in a spiritual sense. When a person is disfellowshipped or is deemed to have disassociated, an announcement is made at the next midweek meeting that the named individual \\"is no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses\\". Congregation members are not informed whether a person is being shunned due to \\"disfellowshipping\\" or \\"disassociation\\", or on what grounds. Shunning starts immediately after the announcement is made. A notification form is sent to the local branch office and records of the disfellowshipping are saved in the congregational records. Both are kept until at least five years after reinstatement. Failure to adhere to the directions on shunning is itself considered a serious offense. Members who continue to speak to or associate with a disfellowshipped or disassociated person are said to be sharing in their \\"wicked works\\" and may themselves be disfellowshipped. Exceptions are made in some cases, such as business relations and immediate family household situations. If a disfellowshipped person is living in the same home with other baptized family members, religious matters are not discussed, with the exception of minors, for whose training parents are still responsible. Disfellowshipped family members outside the home are shunned. Disfellowshipped individuals can continue attending public meetings held at the Kingdom Hall, though they are shunned by the congregation. =Reinstatement= Disfellowshipped individuals may be reinstated into the congregation if they are considered repentant of their previous actions and attitude. If a disassociated or disfellowshipped individual requests reinstatement, a judicial committee, (the committee originally involved, if available) seeks to determine whether the person has repented. Such individuals must demonstrate that they no longer practice the conduct for which they were expelled from the congregation, as well as submission to the group's regulations. Individuals disfellowshipped for actions no longer considered serious sins, such as organ transplants, are not automatically reinstated. Attending meetings while being shunned is a requirement for eventual reinstatement. Once a decision is made to reinstate, a brief announcement is made to the congregation that the individual \\"is reinstated as one of Jehovah's Witnesses\\". Elders are instructed to make an attempt each year to remind disfellowshipped individuals of the steps they can take to qualify for reinstatement. No specific period of time is prescribed before this can happen; however, the Watch Tower Society suggests a period of \\"perhaps many months, a year, or longer.\\" In 1974, the Watch Tower Society stated that about one third of those disfellowshipped eventually return to the group, based on figures gathered from 1963 to 1973. Congregational restrictions are imposed on reinstated individuals. Participation at religious meetings, including commenting from the audience, is initially not permitted; such \\"privileges\\" may be gradually permitted over time if the individual is considered to have \\"progressed spiritually\\". Reinstated individuals may be ineligible for many years from serving in positions of responsibility such as an elder, ministerial servant or pioneer. =Legality= In June 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the Witnesses' right to shun those who fail to live by the group's standards and doctrines, upholding the ruling of a lower court. The court concluded that, \\"Shunning is a practice engaged in by Jehovah's Witnesses pursuant to their interpretation of canonical text, and we are not free to reinterpret that text. ... We find the practice of shunning not to constitute a sufficient threat to the peace, safety, or morality of the community as to warrant state intervention. ... the defendants are entitled to the free exercise of their religious beliefs. ... Courts generally do not scrutinize closely the relationship among members (or former members) of a church. Churches are afforded great latitude when they impose discipline on members or former members. ... The members of the Church Paul decided to abandon have concluded that they no longer want to associate with her. We hold that they are free to make that choice. ... Although we recognize that the harms suffered by Janice Paul are real and not insubstantial, permitting her to recover for intangible or emotional injuries would unconstitutionally restrict the Jehovah's Witnesses free exercise of religion. ... The constitutional guarantee of the free exercise of religion requires that society tolerate the type of harms suffered by Paul as a price well worth paying to safeguard the right of religious difference that all citizens enjoy.\\" In a review of the case, the 1988 Washington University Law Quarterly remarked, \\"The Ninth Circuit's extension of the free exercise clause to include a privilege against tort liability is incorrect. First, by distinguishing emotional harms from physical harms, the court downplayed the significance of an emotional injury, which is often times as great as physical harm. ... In most of the free exercise cases decided by the Supreme Court the government has acted against the religious group, either by imposing criminal sanctions for religious conduct or denying members some benefit because of their religious beliefs. In Paul, however, the religious group acted as the aggressor, violating the plaintiff's right to emotional well-being. By granting defendants an absolute privilege against tort liability, the court has allowed the Church to use the shield of the first amendment as a sword. ... The Paul decision is an unfortunate expansion of a doctrine intended to protect individual rights. To turn the doctrine on its head and use it as a means to thwart another person's rights is an ironic twist that would undoubtedly displease the drafters of the first amendment. ... At best, Paul can be viewed as a slight detour from the correct interpretation of the free exercise clause and the proper balancing of interests performed by the Supreme Court and numerous lower courts.\\" On May 31, 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a 9-0 decision saying courts have no jurisdiction to review membership questions of a religious organization. \\"In the end, religious groups are free to determine their own membership and rules; courts will not intervene in such matters save where it is necessary to resolve an underlying legal dispute,\\" Justice Malcolm Rowe wrote in the decision.  Unbaptized publishers  An unbaptized individual who has previously been approved to share in Jehovah's Witnesses' formal ministry, but who subsequently behaves in a manner considered inappropriate may lose privileges, such as commenting at meetings, receiving assignments, or even accompanying the congregation in the public ministry.The Watchtower 11/15/88 p. 18 par. 14 Helping Others to Worship God If an unbaptized individual is deemed unrepentant of actions for which baptized members might be disfellowshipped, an announcement would be made that the person \\"is no longer a publisher of the good news.\\"The Watchtower 11/15/88 p. 19 par. 17 Helping Others to Worship God Such individuals were previously shunned, but formal restrictions are no longer imposed on unbaptized individuals, though association is generally curtailed. The elders might privately warn individuals in the congregation if the unbaptized person is considered to pose \\"an unusual threat\\".The Watchtower 11/15/88 p. 19 par. 19 Helping Others to Worship God Critical view The only way to officially leave Jehovah's Witnesses is to disassociate or be disfellowshipped, and both entail the same set of prohibitions and penalties, with no provision for continued normal association. Jehovah's Witnesses state that disfellowshipping is a scripturally documented method to protect the congregation from the influence of those who practice serious wrongdoing.Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses ‚Äì Proclaimers of God‚Äôs Kingdom chap. 15 p. 232 \\"Development of the Organization Structure\\" Critics contend that the judicial process itself, due to its private and nearly autonomous nature, directly contradicts the precedent found in the Bible and the organization's own teachings and can be used in an arbitrary manner if there is consensus among just a few to abuse their authority.Raymond Franz, In Search Of Christian Freedom, pp.374‚Äì390. Franz claims the Watch Tower organization ignores the \\"clear principle of openness in the conduct of judicial proceedings\\" and cites the Watch Tower Society publication, Insight on the Scriptures, Vol 1, p. 518, which states that \\"publicity that would be afforded any trial at the gate would tend to influence the judges toward care and justice in the trial proceedings and in their decisions\\". According to Raymond Franz, a letter dated September 1, 1980, from the Watch Tower Society to all circuit and district overseers advised that a member who \\"merely disagrees in thought with any of the Watch Tower Society's teachings is committing apostasy and is liable for disfellowshipping.\\"Franz, Raymond. Crisis of Conscience. 4th ed. Atlanta: Commentary Press, 2004. pp. 341-2. . The letter states that one does not have to \\"promote\\" different doctrines to be an apostate, adding that elders need to \\"discern between one who is a trouble-making apostate and a Christian who becomes weak in the faith and has doubts.\\"  See also  * Excommunication * Ostracism * Shunning * Silent treatment References Category:Beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Category:Disengagement from religion Category:Punishments in religion ","title":"Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline"},{"id":"4130224","text":"VSNL International Canada or Tata Communications (Canada) ULC (formerly Teleglobe) is an international telco carrier. The company is a subsidiary of Tata Communications, part of India's Tata Group and based in Montreal, Quebec. Part of their recent work has involved the updating of the CANTAT transatlantic cable system that connects the United Kingdom and Newfoundland under the Atlantic Ocean. The latest version of CANTAT, CANTAT-3, had a capacity of 5 Gbit/s in each direction across the Atlantic. History The company was, in 1950, a Canadian federal Crown corporation called Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (COTC). In 1975 the COTC was renamed Teleglobe Canada. After the 1984 election, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney began the process of privatizing Crown corporations and Teleglobe Canada was one of the target assets. It was finally sold to a small telecommunications equipment maker Memotec Data Incorporated of Montreal in 1987 and Teleglobe Canada became a unit of its new owners. In 1992, Memotec changed its own name to Teleglobe Canada Incorporated. In 2000 Teleglobe Inc. was acquired by Bell Canada Enterprises, or BCE, which had already owned 23%. In 2002, BCE terminated its relationship with Teleglobe. BCE is now defending several litigations arising out of its abandonment of the Teleglobe business. It was then sold to two American buyers, New York City based Cerberus Capital LLP and Philadelphia based Ten-X Capital Partners LLC.

The road runs from Placentia (modern Piacenza) to Arelate (modern Arles), initially westward along the edge of the plain of the River Po to Derthona (Tortona), then southward to the Ligurian coast. There it formed a continuous route westward along the precipitous descent of the Ligurian mountains into the sea. This takes it to Vada Sabatia (Vado Ligure), Albingaunum (Albenga) and Album Intimilium (Ventimiglia), continuing to La Turbie (above modern Monaco), where its original terminus was marked by a triumphal arch. Later it was extended, taking a route away from the coast via the valley of the River Laghet, north of Nice and westward to Arles where it joined the Via Domitia.The Romans on the Riviera and the Rhone by W.

It began in 1987 and has continued to grow in both scope and size every year. In 2017, the conference lasted for 10 days with the interactive track lasting for five days, music for seven days, and film for nine days. SXSW is run by the company SXSW, LLC, which organizes conferences, trade shows, festivals, and other events. In addition to the three main South by Southwest festivals, the company runs other conferences: SXSW EDU, a conference on educational innovation, held in Austin, and the me Convention (started in 2017), held in Frankfurt, Germany and in Stockholm, Sweden, in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz. Former conferences run by the SXSW organization include SXSW Eco, a conference focusing on social and environmental issues through the lens of technology, creativity and design held in Austin from 2011 to 2016; and another in Las Vegas: SXSW V2V, a conference focused on innovative startups, which ran from 2013 to 2015. Previously, SXSW produced music festivals North by Northwest (NXNW) in Portland, Oregon, North by Northeast (NXNE) in Toronto, and West by Southwest (WXSW) in Tucson, Arizona. For the first time ever, the 2020 event was cancelled as a result of local health concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic.  Divisions  6th Street in downtown Austin, Texas, during SXSW 2013  Music  SXSW Music is the largest music festival of its kind in the world, with more than 2,000 acts as of 2014. SXSW Music offers artist-provided music and video samples of featured artists at each festival via their official YouTube channel. The music event has grown from 700 registrants in 1987, the first year of the conference, to over 161,000 attendees in 2018. SXSW Film and SXSW Interactive events have grown every year, bringing over 32,000 registrants to Austin in March 2013. Bands must cover their own expenses for travel and lodging at the event. All performers are offered a cash payment or a wristband package that allows access to all music events.  Film  SXSW Film Conference spans five days of conference panels and sessions, and welcomes filmmakers of all levels. Programming consists of keynote speakers, panels, workshops, mentor sessions and more, with expert filmmakers and industry leaders. In 2015, the SXSW Film Conference programmed over 250 sessions with 735 speakers. Past speakers include Jon Favreau, Mark Duplass, Ava DuVernay, Ryan Gosling, Nicolas Cage, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Tilda Swinton, Amy Schumer, Sally Field, Joss Whedon, Christine Vachon, RZA, Matthew McConaughey, Danny Boyle, Seth MacFarlane, Catherine Hardwicke, Richard Linklater, David Gordon Green, Harmony Korine, Henry Rollins, Sarah Green and Robert Rodriguez. Although the film festival often highlights independently produced films and emerging directing talent with unique visions, the festival has long served studios as a starting point for their comedies, using enthusiastic fans as a barometer of how they might play in wide release. The SXSW Film Festival runs nine days, simultaneously with the SXSW Film Conference, and celebrates raw innovation and emerging talent both behind and in front of the camera. Festival programming categories include: Special Events, Headliners, Narrative Spotlight, Documentary Spotlight, Narrative Competition, Documentary Competition, Visions, Midnighters, 24 Beats Per Second, SXGlobal, Episodic, Festival Favorites, and Short Film Programs. The SXSW Film Awards, which occur on the last day of the Film Conference, honor films selected by the Feature and Short Film Juries. In 2015, the SXSW Film Festival programmed 150 feature films and 106 short films, selected from 7,361 submissions. Past notable world premieres include Furious 7, Neighbors, Chef, 21 Jump Street, The Cabin in the Woods, Dance of the Dead, Bridesmaids and Insidious, and the TV series Girls, Silicon Valley and Penny Dreadful.  Interactive  SXSW Interactive is focused on emerging technology. The festival includes a trade show, speakers, parties, and a startup accelerator.  History  SXSW employee giving an introduction of the event at a community meetup.  Inauguration ‚Äì 1980s  In July 1986, the organizers of the New York City music festival New Music Seminar contacted Roland Swenson, a staffer at the alternative weekly The Austin Chronicle, talked about organizing an extension of that festival into Austin, thereafter announced they were going to hold a \\"New Music Seminar Southwest\\". The plans did not materialize, so Swenson decided to instead co-organize a local music festival, with the help of two other people at the Chronicle: editor and co-founder Louis Black, and publisher Nick Barbaro. Louis Meyers, a booking agent and musician, was also brought on board.A Guide to the South By Southwest, Inc., Records, 1987‚Äì1997, Briscoe Center for American History, The University of Texas at Austin Black came up with the name, as a play on the name of the Alfred Hitchcock film North by Northwest. While Southwest by South is an actual point on a compass, South by Southwest is not (SWbS is a heading of 213.75 degrees). The event was first held in March 1987. The organizers considered it a regional event and expected around 150 attendees to show up, but over 700 came, and according to Black \\"it was national almost immediately.\\"SXSW stays course, continues growth, Alex Geiser, The Daily Texan, March 18, 2010 Meyers left Austin and the festival in the early 1990s, but Black, Barbaro and Swenson remained the festival's key organizers as of 2010.  1990s  Singer-songwriter Michelle Shocked was the keynote speaker at the 1992 South by Southwest. She caused controversy by delivering a speech, written by her then-husband Bart Bull, criticizing white musicians for stealing music from African American artists; and then later during the same conference when she tried to kick the band Two Nice Girls off of a benefit concert, a move that some called anti-gay, due to Two Nice Girls' overtly lesbian image.The Education of Michelle Shocked, Robert Wilonsky, Dallas Observer, April 25, 1996 In 1993, SXSW moved into the Austin Convention Center, where it is still held. In 1994, SXSW added a component for film and other media, named the \\"SXSW Film and Multimedia Conference\\". Johnny Cash was the keynote speaker. That year, the three brothers of the band Hanson were brought to SXSW by their father in order to perform impromptu auditions for music executives, in the hopes of getting industry attention. Among the people who heard them was A&R; executive Christopher Sabec, who became their manager, and would soon afterward get them signed to Mercury Records. In 1995, the SXSW Film and Multimedia Conference was split into two separate events, \\"SXSW Film\\" and \\"SXSW Multimedia\\". In 1999, SXSW Multimedia was renamed \\"SXSW Interactive\\".  2000s  Singer- songwriter John Mayer's performance at the 2000 SXSW Music festival led to his signing soon thereafter with Aware Records, his first record label. A performance by the band The Polyphonic Spree at the 2002 SXSW Music festival helped bring them to national attention before they had signed with a major label. At the 2002 SXSW Film Festival, the film Manito won the jury award for narrative feature, while the documentary Spellbound won the jury award for documentary feature. British singer James Blunt was discovered by producer Linda Perry while playing a small show at the 2004 SXSW Music festival, and was signed to Perry's Custard Records soon thereafter, where he would go on to release all three of his subsequent albums. The 2005 SXSW Film is considered by some to be the origin of the mumblecore film genre. A number of films now classified as mumblecore, including The Puffy Chair, Kissing on the Mouth, Four Eyed Monsters and Mutual Appreciation, were screened, and Eric Masunaga, a musician and the sound editor on Mutual Appreciation, is credited with coining the term \\"mumblecore\\" at a bar while at the festival.Lim, Dennis (August 19, 2007). \\"Mumblecore ‚Äì The New Talkies: Generation DIY\\".

The film Hooligans won both the Feature Film Jury Award and the Feature Film Audience Award for narrative feature, while The Puffy Chair won the Feature Film Audience Award in the \\"Emerging Visions\\" category. The documentary film Cowboy del Amor won the SXSW Competition Award and the Audience Award.

Coordinating through Twitter and other online tools, notatsxsw events were held in London, New York, Wisconsin, Portland, Oregon and Miami. The mobile app, Foursquare, was launched at SXSW 2009.

At the 2010 festival, nearly 2,000 bands were officially scheduled to perform, and festival reps estimated that over 13,000 industry representatives attended. Though traditionally the Austin Music Awards kick off the festival, that year organizers slated it as the closing act. Local musician Bob Schneider earned 6 awards, including Song of the Year, Singer of the Year, and Band of the Year (with Lonelyland.) The 2010 festival was also notable for appearances by the surviving members of the band Moby Grape.Raul Hernandez, Live Shots: SXSW Music 2010, Austin Chronicle, March 26, 2010. At the 2010 Film festival, Magnolia Pictures bought the film rights to the science-fiction film Monsters on the night it screened, in what was the first- ever \\"overnight acquisition\\" at SXSW.

SXSW 2018 coincided with a string of bombings in Austin, which had begun on March 2 and ended on March 21, when the presumed perpetrator, Mark Anthony Conditt, blew himself up after being discovered by police. Two of the bombings occurred during SXSW. On March 17, Live Nation Music, a company organizing events for SXSW, received a bomb threat via email. Police searched the area mentioned in the email and found nothing of concern, but planned performances by The Roots and Ludacris, among others, were canceled. Police arrested 26-year-old Trevor Weldon Ingram the next day; Ingram was charged with making a terroristic threat, a third-degree felony, in connection with the email. = 2019 = South by Southwest 2019 ran from March 8 to 17. Films entered at SXSW Film included Us, The Beach Bum, Long Shot, Booksmart and The Highwaymen. TV series that previewed included FX‚Äôs What We Do in the Shadows, Hulu‚Äôs Shrill and OWN‚Äôs David Makes Man. At the SXSW Gaming Awards (held March 16), the award for Game of the Year went to God of War. Major performers for SXSW Music included Edie Brickell & New Bohemians (their first-ever appearance at SXSW). Winners of the 2019 SXSW Pitch event, in which emerging startups pitch to potential investors, included Derq, Pathway and ENZO Tyres.

To promote the final season of Game of Thrones, HBO organized a blood drive with the American Red Cross titled \\"Bleed for the Throne\\" which included actors in costumes similar to those on the series. To promote the Amazon Prime original limited series Good Omens, a brand activation experience called \\"Garden of Earthly Delights\\" was installed in downtown Austin.  2020 cancellation  South by Southwest 2020 was scheduled to run from March 13 to 22, but was officially cancelled on March 6 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the result of an order by the city of Austin. The city's Mayor Steve Adler announced the cancellation of the 2020 SXSW and also declared a local state of emergency.https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/austin-considers-spring- festivals-sxsw-in-light-of-covid-19-spread/2325885/ In the month prior to the conference, SXSW organizers had resisted calls to cancel the conference. On February 28, a spokesperson said: However, in the run up to the conference, numerous companies and organizations began cancelling their SXSW attendance, including Twitter, Facebook, Vevo, Intel, Mashable, Universal Music Group, Amazon, Entertainment Weekly, TikTok, SAP, Netflix, Apple, Indeed, WarnerMedia, The Washington Post, and IBM. Additionally, many individual attendees, headliners and speakers had decided not to attend, including keynote speaker Tim Ferriss and artists such as the Beastie Boys, Ozzy Osbourne and Trent Reznor. An online petition was started that called for SXSW 2020 to be cancelled due to health concerns; by the time of the cancellation, it exceeded 50,000 signatures. SXSW organizers said that they were \\"devastated\\" by the cancellation, stating that, \\"'The show must go on' is in our DNA.\\" They wrote that they were attempting to reschedule the event, and were at the same time working to create an online SXSW for 2020. SXSW co- founder Nick Barbaro said the organization did not have cancellation insurance relating to a disease pandemic or triggered by the city declaring a ‚Äúlocal state of disaster.‚Äù Despite the cancellation of SXSW 2020 amid concerns over COVID-19, unofficial SXSW events, as well as ‚Äúalternative‚Äù SXSW events, have gained momentum trying to rally around the local workers and businesses who would be hurt most by the cancellation.https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/despite-sxsw-cancellation- unofficial-and-alternative-events-look-to-gain-momentum/ The Austin Community Foundation launched a ‚ÄúStand with Austin Fund‚Äù for donations to ‚Äúindividuals and small businesses most negatively impacted by the cancellation of SXSW and least able to recover on their own.‚Äùhttps://www.austincf.org/Stand-with-Austin A fundraiser called \\"Banding Together\\" was started by the Red River Cultural District to provide financial relief for artists venues and events within the district. On March 13, 2020 festival organizers announced that they will proceed with juried and special awards, with judges viewing submissions via digital links. On March 24, SXSW announced the winners of the 2020 SXSW Gaming Awards on the SXSW website, and the honorees recorded acceptance messages for the SXSW YouTube channel and the SXSW website. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice was awarded Video Game of the Year. On April 2, SXSW announced a joint venture with Amazon Prime Video to launch a film festival collection. Filmmakers scheduled to screen films at SXSW were notified April 2, and will be able to opt in; those who do so will see their films play exclusively on Prime Video in the U.S. for the 10-day \\"virtual film festival,\\" which Amazon will likely launch in late April. The online event will be available in front of the Prime Video paywall and free to U.S. audiences. In May, SXSW organizers announced the \\"SXSW Sessions Online,\\" a weekly series of online discussions to run through June, with some of the previously announced guest speakers; each video session is streamed online with Q&A; portions made available initially to those originally registered for the festival. Each session is made available to the public afterwards on the SXSW YouTube channel.  Economic impact  SXSW is the highest revenue-producing event outside of athletic and other events associated with The University of Texas at Austin for the Austin economy, with an estimated economic impact of $190.3 million in 2012 increasing to $218 million in 2013, $315 million in 2014, $317 million in 2015, and $325 million in 2016. (In comparison, Super Bowl LI brought a $347 million economic impact to the Houston economy and the 2017 Final Four brought a $324 million economic impact to the economy of Phoenix, Arizona.) Additionally, demand for hotel rooms in the Austin area continued to outstrip supply, pushing average nightly room rates up to an all-time high of $350 in 2016, a 60 percent increase over the average room rate seen during 2011's edition of SXSW. The average SXSW registrant also stayed in Austin longer in 2016, spending an average of 5.2 nights, up from 4.9 nights in 2015.  Criticism  The growth of the festival has brought concerns about violence, crowd control, and safety. The 2014 drunk-driving incident prompted discussion about whether the festival had grown too large and raucous. The organizers of the festival‚ÄîSXSW Holdings LLC and SXSW Holdings Inc.‚Äîwere sued by families of the four victims. In May 2014, partially motivated by the 2014 crash, Austin's Urban Transportation Commission announced that it was seeking to enhance safety at the festival, with an initial focus on implementing transportation measures to resolve issues linked to the festival. The Austin Music Commission also met to discuss music venues and sound problems linked to the festival. The city voted to limit the number of special events which would be approved to 114, a 32 percent decrease from the number of approved events during the 2014 festival. In 2013, NPR writer Andrea Swensson wrote that she had decided to stop attending the festival, writing, \\"I can't help but feel that it has strayed far away from its original premise as a grassroots gathering place for new, undiscovered talent and increasingly feels like a big ol' Times Square billboard-sized commercial.\\" In October 2015, SXSW cancelled two video game panels (\\"#SavePoint: A Discussion on the Gaming Community\\" and \\"Level Up: Overcoming Harassment In Games\\") scheduled for the 2016 festival due to threats of violence made to the festival hosting the sessions. In response to the cancellations, Buzzfeed and Vox Media made statements saying they would pull out of the festival if the two panels weren't reinstated. Organizers then apologized for the cancellations. In lieu of a panel, South by Southwest hosted a daylong \\"online harassment summit\\" on March 12, 2016.  In popular culture  * Comedian and actor Fred Armisen began his comic career with the short film Fred Armisen's Guide to Music and SXSW, released in 1998, in which he poses as various characters, asking silly questions of musicians and other attendees at that year's SXSW Music Conference. * SXSW was featured during the 2005 season of MTV's, The Real World. Cast members were tasked with shooting and editing their own documentary on the music festival. * The 2011 documentary Winning America is about a US tour of Canadian band Said the Whale that culminates in that year's SXSW Music Festival. * In the 2014 British film Frank, an experimental band (led by the title character) is booked to play a show at the SXSW Music Festival, but the gig leads to the band's breakup. * In the 2019 anime Carole & Tuesday, the titular duo is booked to perform at the SXSW Music Festival.  Similar festivals  The creators of South by Southwest co-created two similar festivals in 1995: North by Northwest (NXNW) in Portland, Oregon (co-founded by the Willamette Week), and North by Northeast (NXNE) in Toronto (co-founded by Now). North by Northwest ended in 2001, and was replaced by MusicfestNW (MFNW), an event run entirely by the Willamette Week. It was joined by TechfestNW, a technology conference, in 2012.Tech may have found its next SXSW, John Patrick Pullen, CNNMoney, August 28, 2012 From 2006 to 2010, SXSW organizers also ran West by Southwest (WXSW) in Tucson, Arizona, a music festival which occurred directly before South by Southwest and mostly featured bands that were also booked for SXSW.Go West (by Southwest), young band , Polly Higgins, Tucson Citizen, March 9, 2006 Other active festivals inspired by SXSW include the following: * Web Summit ‚Äì Lisbon, Portugal * Live at Heart ‚Äì √ñrebro, Sweden * South by Due East ‚Äì Houston, Texas * The Goa Project ‚Äì Goa, India * The Great Escape Festival ‚Äì Brighton, England * Tech Open Air (TOA) ‚Äì Berlin * XOXO ‚Äì Portland, Oregon Festivals inspired by SXSW that are no longer running include: * 35 Denton (originally known as \\"North by 35\\" or \\"NX35\\", then \\"35 Conferette\\") ‚Äì Denton, Texas (2009‚Äì2016) * C2SV (originally known as \\"SVSX\\") ‚Äì San Jose, California (2012‚Äì2016) * Incubate (originally known as \\"ZXZW\\") ‚Äì Tilburg, Netherlands (2005‚Äì2016) * MidPoint Music Festival (MPMF) ‚Äì Cincinnati, Ohio (2001‚Äì2017) * MoSo ‚Äì Saskatoon, Canada (2011‚Äì2016) * So What?!

Metro Silicon Valley, which founded C2SV, wrote in 2013 that such festivals were important revenue sources for the alternative weekly newspapers that founded them. On October 3, 2016, a one-day festival, called \\"South by South Lawn\\" (SXSL), was held at the White House; it was a collaboration between SXSW, US President Barack Obama, and the American Film Institute.

John was born around 1608. He was the eldest son of Robert Middleton of Caldhame and his wife Catherine Strachan; the elder brother of Alexander Middleton and uncle of Alexander's first son George Middleton DD, both of whom served as Principal of King's College, Aberdeen; great uncle of George's son John Middleton (1678‚Äì1739); and great-great uncle of Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham.M. R. R. M'Gilchrist Gilchrist, Sir James Balfour Paul ed., The Scots Peerage, volume VI (Edinburgh, 1909) pages 177‚Äì180. Military career In early life Middleton served as a soldier in France; later he fought against Charles I both in England and in Scotland, being especially prominent at the Battle of Philiphaugh and in other operations against James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Middleton held a high command in the Scottish army which marched to rescue the king in 1648, and he was taken prisoner after the Battle of Preston. He joined Charles II when that monarch reached Scotland in 1650, but he was soon at variance with the party which at that time was dominant in church and state and was only restored to favour after doing a public penance at Dundee. He was a captive for the second time after the Battle of Worcester, where he commanded the Royalist cavalry, but he escaped from the Tower of London to Paris. In 1653, Middleton was chosen by Charles II to head the projected rising in Scotland. He reached Scotland in February 1654, but the insurrection was a complete failure. Its leader, who could not be held responsible for this result, remained in Scotland until 1655, when he rejoined Charles II, who created him Earl of Middleton in 1656 with the subsidiary title Lord Clermont and Fettercairn. Political career Following the Restoration Middleton returned to England with the King in 1660 and was appointed commander-in-chief of the troops in Scotland and Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland, which he opened in January 1661. He was an ardent advocate of the restoration of episcopacy, this being one of the issues which led to serious dissensions between the Earl of Lauderdale and himself, and in 1663 he was deprived of his offices. From 1663 to 1667 he was appointed Governor of Rochester Castle and Lieutenant-General of the Kent militia. In 1667 he was appointed governor of English Tangier on the coast of Morocco. While there, he fell down stairs after a bout of drinking and died of his injuries on 3 July 1674.

Eight years earlier Martin Luther had been banned by the Holy Roman Empire at the Diet of Worms of 1521. Emperor Charles V had wanted to end the religious unrest between the Catholic majority and the evangelical minority at the Second Diet of Speyer. The \\"Lutheran Heresy\\" and the resulting religious strife did not figure in his political plans. The Edict of Worms had been suspended in 1526, when the Diet of Speyer decided that every prince should hold whichever religious beliefs he could justify before his King and God. Three years after the Diet of 1526, on the 1 March 1529 Charles V announced the second Diet of Speyer. He again let himself be represented by his brother Ferdinand, as he could not personally appear due to the war with France. In his opening address Ferdinand gave the decision of the Emperor: the annulment of the Diet's decision in 1526, recognition of \\"great mistakes and misunderstanding\\" and the threat of Imperial Ban against \\"seduction by false beliefs\\". Until clarification from another council all further new developments would remain forbidden. He also made further declarations: > \\"Those that until now have followed the Edict of Worms should continue to do > so. In the areas where this has been deviated from, there shall be no > further new developments and no-one shall be refused Mass. Finally, the > sects which contradict the sacrament of the true body and blood, shall > absolutely not be tolerated, no more than the Anabaptists.\\" On 19 April the majority of representatives accepted the revocation of the 1526 edict. The evangelicals were told that they should yield \\"to the fair and proper decisions\\" of the majority. At this point the evangelical princes left the hall. When they returned somewhat later, Ferdinand wanted to leave the hall and refused to listen to them. So their objection was read out: they protested against the decision of the majority, to undo the decision of the 1526 Reichstag. Ferdinand demanded that they \\"accept and obey the decision\\". The Protestant delegates refused to be bound by secular authority in matters of faith. On 20 April they presented the \\"Letter of Protestation\\", which Ferdinand refused to accept. Therefore, it did not come to be read out, but was printed and made public. The \\"Letter of Protestation\\" was signed by Johann, Elector of Saxony, Georg, Margrave of Brandenburg, Ernst, Duke of Braunschweig-L√ºneburg, Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, and Wolfgang, Prince of Anhalt. At the final sitting of the Diet on 24 April the \\"decision of the Diet\\" was once more read out, but no word was said of the protest by the evangelical princes. In response the councils of the evangelical princes and the agents of the Free Cities met on 25 April and drew up a Instrumentum Appellationis, in which complaints against the decision of the Diet were once more summarised. This text was brought to the Holy Roman Emperor by an embassy. Since this Diet in Speyer the adherents of the reform movement became known as \\"Protestants\\", and thus the protestation of the Princes and Free Cities has been seen as the birth of Protestantism.

On 19 April . . . the first protestation followed. It was rejected. Accordingly, the evangelical estates presented a second protestation on 20 April which repeated the previous day's arguments in greater detail. . . . The protestation received legal status through the appeal that the Protestant princes and imperial cities lodged before two notaries in Speyer on 25 April 1529.

It was dissolved in 1803 in the secularisation of Bavaria. The abbey buildings were partly demolished, partly acquired by private owners. In 1874 the Bavarian government set up a home for disabled men in the remaining premises, the running of which they entrusted to the Order of the Brothers Hospitallers. Apart from the years of World War II, when under the National Socialist government the Brothers were obliged to close the home and leave, they remained here until 1970, when declining numbers forced them to give up Attel. The running of the home was taken over by the Charity Union of M√ºnchen-Freising until 1994, when it became independently managed.

The series, loosely based on the detective novels of Liza Cody, starred Imogen Stubbs as the title character, alongside Brian Glover, John Rowe, Peter Wight and Wil Johnson. The series was produced by Brian Eastman, in conjunction with Carnival Films for London Weekend Television. Following a single pilot episode, broadcast in 1993, London Weekend Television commissioned a full-length five-episode series, to be filmed later that year for broadcast in 1994.https://itvstudios.com/programmes/anna-lee The pilot had a mostly different cast, apart from Stubbs and Glover. All six episodes were later broadcast in the United States on the A&E; cable network. Music for the series was provided by Anne Dudley, while the theme tune, \\"Sister, Sister\\", was performed by Luciana, who also appeared in the final episode. Notably, despite all six episodes being adapted from their parent books, considerable alterations were made for television, much to the dismay of writer Liza Cody. Reportedly, this prompted Cody to abandon writing any further Anna Lee books; as she had previously signed a contract with LWT to allow for any further books to be adapted for television. However, despite much detail being removed for the television adaptations, LWT's most notable contribution to series was the casting of Brian Glover; like his character Selwyn Price, Glover was an ex-professional wrestler, and his room full of wrestling posters seen in the series were in fact real posters featuring Leon Arras, the name Glover used when wrestling.

He is the frontman of the Swedish band Mando Diao. Biography Dixg√•rd in 2013 Bj√∂rn Hans-Erik Dixg√•rd was born on 8 May 1981, near Falun, Sweden, as the second child of Hans and Malin Dixgard. Some years later, the family moved to Romme, a town in the south of Borl√§nge. Bj√∂rn attended elementary school and secondary school in Romme. One of his favorite activities as a young boy was fishing. Music was always omnipresent in the Dixg√•rd house. With Malin Dixg√•rd being a gifted singer, and Hans Dixg√•rd playing guitar in a band, their talents and taste in music were passed on to their children. The first bands that had an influence on Bj√∂rn were The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks and The Who. Later at school, where the two main topics were football and rock music, new bands like Nirvana were added, and since 1995 Britpop bands like Oasis and Blur. His relationship with his parents was never overshadowed by teenage rebellion; Hans and Malin as former hippies and occupied in social work had the skill to block conflicts. Bj√∂rn became a member of a band for the first time at the age of fourteen when he started playing guitar in a band called ‚ÄúButler‚Äù, which he founded together with Daniel Haglund, who was to be the first keyboarder of Mando Diao. Bj√∂rn and Daniel knew each other from school. In 1996, Bj√∂rn and Gustaf Nor√©n met at a party. A short time later Bj√∂rn invited Gustaf to join his band; they became the two frontmen of Butler. In 1997, the name Butler was changed to Mando Jao. Allegedly Bj√∂rn had a dream where a man appeared and shouted at him, telling him to name his band Mando Jao. Bj√∂rn obeyed. Gustaf left the band in 1998, after moving to Falun and becoming alienated from his friends. He soon came back. In 1999, the name was changed to Mando Diao, as the band was sure it would offer a better English pronunciation. Band members at this time were Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd, Gustaf Nor√©n, Daniel Haglund, and Carl-Johan Fogelklou. During the same year Samuel Giers joined the band as drummer. Daniel Haglund left the band in 2004 and was replaced by Mats Bj√∂rke. Touring bars and small locations all over Sweden were soon followed by performances in Central Europe; the USA and Japan. Each of Mando Diao's album releases became more successful; today they are one of Sweden's best known bands. In 2007, Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd did a solo tour in Europe. In 2008, Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd and Gustaf Nor√©n joined the artist network Caligola; in 2012, the album Back To Earth was the first release of the music project. Mando Diao's biggest success in their home country Sweden was achieved with the sixth studio album Infruset where ten poems of the Swedish poet Gustaf Fr√∂ding were set to music in 2012. Bj√∂rn married the Swedish actress and producer Emma Kihlberg in January, 2008, at S√∂dra Teatern in Stockholm. They have two children. Bj√∂rn's older sister Linn√©a Dixg√•rd is the singer of the band Twinflower Band.

The HEA advocated for evidence-based teaching methods and awards fellowships as a method of professional recognition for university teachers. The HEA was responsible for the UK Professional Standards Framework for higher education practitioners. On 21 March 2018, the HEA merged with the Leadership Foundation and the Equality Challenge Unit to form Advance HE.Advance HE https://www.advance- he.ac.uk/questions-answers Accessed 18 June 2018 \\"The merger of the Equality Challenge Unit, the Higher Education Academy and the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education followed the recommendations of the Bell Review for a single sector agency for equality and diversity, learning and teaching, and leadership and governance in higher education.\\" The HEA had premises in York Science Park, Heslington. Its work is continued by Advance HE, which now operates the Higher Education Academy's professional membership scheme. History and formation The history of teacher training in the United Kingdom is a complex subject. In 1946, faced with chronic personnel shortages after the 2nd World War, the government invested in training programmes and required all teachers in the state sector to acquire qualified teacher status. For the next half century, Universities responded to this policy by providing both graduate entrants into teaching and teacher training programmes. In recent decades however, there has been a shift towards school-based training for teaching and also a change in terminology as teacher education has displaced teacher training Despite Higher Education's involvement in teacher training, University Lecturers have not needed any formal qualifications beyond demonstrating, usually through publications and a higher degree (such as a doctorate), expert subject knowledge. The merits of professional teaching qualifications for University Lecturers became an issue for debate during the later twentieth century. In 1997, the Dearing Report recommended the establishment of a professional body for Lecturers, the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, that would define standards and accredit training for university teaching. In a further recommendation, the Dearing Report suggested that during their probationary periods, all new Lecturers should be required to achieve 'at least associate membership' of the new Institute. In response, the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education was founded in 2000. In January 2003, a committee established by HEFCE, Universities UK and the Standing Conference of Principals recommended the establishment of a single central body responsible for standards of teaching in higher education. In response, the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education was merged with the Learning and Teaching Support Network and the National Coordination Team for the Teaching Quality Enhancement Fund, becoming the Higher Education Academy. Aims and purpose The HEA stated its overall aim in the following words: The HEA devised a particular set of standards for university teaching (the 'UK Professional Standards Framework'), conferring professional recognition on academics who have met these standards, and runs the UK's annual National Teaching Fellowship awards. It also provides many online resources, some discipline- specific and some more generic, and organises workshops, seminars and journals on matters of interest. The HEA has a 'policy think-tank' and is engaged in research into teaching and learning, e.g. exploring the applicability of 'grade point average' schemes to the UK. UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF) The UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF) for teaching and supporting learning in higher education is a voluntary scheme for describing the competences and values expected of university teaching staff in the UK. The scheme consists of four 'descriptors', corresponding to different roles in higher education, and defines the areas of activity, core knowledge and professional values expected at each level. UKPSF was developed by the HEA and UKPSF's descriptors correspond to the levels in HEA's professional recognition scheme. The introduction of national professional standards for university teachers was one of the higher education reforms proposed in the 2003 DfES white paper \\"The Future of Higher Education\\". This paper outlined government plans to introduce new standards and to ensure that all new university teaching staff achieved a qualification that met them. These would be the responsibility of a new single \\"centre of excellence\\" in the form of a \\"teaching quality academy\\". In response to this, the HEA was formed, and commissioned by the UK's education funding councils and Universities UK to develop the new standards. These became known as the \\"UK Professional Standards Framework\\" or \\"UKPSF\\". The framework has two elements: the \\"descriptors\\" which describe higher education roles and the associated competences, and the \\"dimensions of practice\\" which describe the activities, core knowledge and professional values expected of practitioners. There are four descriptors corresponding to support staff with minor teaching duties, full academics (e.g. lecturers), senior academics with teaching specialisms, and senior management with strategic responsibility for teaching. The descriptors correspond to the four grades within the HEA's professional recognition scheme and academic staff are usually expected to demonstrate that they meet the second descriptor during their probationary period. The framework is used to accredit training schemes for university teachers such as the Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PGCHE) and the Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice.  Fellowships of the HEA and professional recognition  The HEA operated a professional recognition scheme (now run by Advance HE) for university teachers who have demonstrated that their teaching practices are well-aligned with UKPSF. This is intended both to encourage excellence in teaching and to provide academics with a portable qualification transferable between institutions. There are four grades: * AFHEA ‚Äì Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy * FHEA ‚Äì Fellow of the Higher Education Academy * SFHEA ‚Äì Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy * PFHEA ‚Äì Principal Fellow of the Higher Education Academy The Associate Fellow grade represents the minimum level of competence expected of any university teacher, with the Fellow grade representing the level normally required in an established academic post. These grades can be awarded on the basis of an assessed portfolio (containing a candidate's statement and supporting references) or on completion of an accredited course such as a PGCHE or PGCAP. The higher grades of Senior Fellow and Principal Fellow represent significant leadership in the promotion of teaching excellence, and are only awarded on the basis of an assessed portfolio. Funding The Higher Education Academy was funded by grants from four higher education funding bodies in the UK (HEFCE, SFC, HEFCW and DELNI), subscriptions from higher education institutions, and grant/contract income for organised initiatives. It is owned by the representative bodies of the higher education sector ‚Äì Universities UK and GuildHE (formerly known as the Standing Conference of Principals). Historical activities HEA used to incorporate \\"subject centres\\" to share best practices in specific disciplines. These centres were based around the UK at relevant university faculties. As of 1 January 2012, the subject centres have closed. Archived resources that have been developed over their 12 years will still be available in the discipline pages of the HEA website.

Biography He moved to Great Britain's North American colonies in about 1749 as a surveyor and cartographer for the Granville District which included all of North Carolina north of the 35 degree, 34 minute parallel, a strip wide. This line had only been surveyed as far west as the Haw River at that time. The northern boundary, the Virginia line, had been run as far west as the Blue Ridge in present-day Stokes County by 1729. At that date, the entire area was still a part of Bertie County and extended west to the Pacific Ocean, the claims of the Spanish and French notwithstanding. In 1749, William Churton, and Crown lawyer Daniel Weldon, representing the interests of Lord Granville, along with Peter Jefferson and Joshua Fry, representing the interests of the Colony of Virginia, surveyed an additional westward of the Blue Ridge to Steep Rock Creek. Daniel Weldon‚Äôs seat was near the present town of Weldon. Peter Jefferson was the father of Thomas Jefferson and Joshua Fry was formerly a professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at the College of William & Mary. Jefferson and Fry had earlier (1746) completed a similar survey of the extensive holdings of Lord Fairfax in western Virginia. More to the point, they had, in 1749, formed a venture called the Loyal Land Company, which included Lewises and Meriwethers and other Albemarle County residents. The Loyal Land Company was chartered ‚Äú... for the discovery and sale of western lands‚Äù and was granted ‚Äúeight hundred thousand acres [3,200 km¬≤] in one or more surveys beginning on the Bounds between this Colony & North Carolina & running to the Westward & the North...‚Äù Jefferson and Fry needed to establish the southern boundary of Virginia so as to delineate the limits of their grant. The southern boundary of the Granville district was soon extended as far west as Cold Water Creek at what is now the Rowan‚ÄìCabarrus county line but did not reach the Blue Ridge until September 1772. Churton further surveyed a portion of the area beyond the Blue Ridge between August 1752 and January 1753, accompanied by Moravian Bishop August Gottlieb Spangenberg and a party of Moravians to survey tracts totaling 98,925 acres (400 km¬≤) in the ‚ÄúBlue Mountains‚Äù for the Moravians. Bishop Spargenburgs‚Äô diary provides glimpses of William Churton wherein he is characterized as ‚Äúcertainly a reasonable man‚Äù and ‚Äúexcessively scrupulous‚Äù in his surveying practice and a ‚Äúgood companion‚Äù. Churton maintained a relationship with the Moravians until his death. The Virginia commissioners, Jefferson and Fry, produced a map of Virginia in 1751 which showed much detail in the adjacent Granville district. They again produced a second edition in 1755 with significant increases in detail in the western areas of the Granville district. It appears that said detail was, in both cases, obtained from William Churton, although no credit is given to Churton on either of the Jefferson-Fry maps. Lord Granville‚Äôs revenue from his land was derived from a ‚Äúquitrent‚Äù to be collected yearly from the landholders of his land. The term is derived because it ‚Äúquit‚Äù the landholder from certain feudal obligations to which Lord Granville was entitled under provisions of the charter. The quitrent varied from time to time from a farthing to a halfpenny per acre, without regard to location, productivity or other consideration. Churton deferred the drawing of the plats and writing of the deed until he returned to Granville‚Äôs office in Edenton. Long delays inevitably ensued. Churton sometimes assisted the waiting grantees caught in such delay by intervening with Granville‚Äôs agents and on occasion, paying the accumulated quitrents himself. Many of his original plats survive today in the State Archives of North Carolina. In 1753, Churton and one William Vigers received a grant for 635 acres (2.6 km¬≤) to hold in trust for the establishment of the Town of Salisbury. The next year, Churton likewise received a grant of 663 acres (2.7 km¬≤) to establish the town of Orange, which was subsequently renamed Corbinton, then Childsburg and finally Hillsborough on the north bank of the Eno River. Churton and his assistant Enoch Lewis laid out 120 lots of for the new town in the summer of 1754. Churton had been appointed Register of Deeds for the new county of Orange County when it was erected in 1752, but the actual function was carried out by his deputy, William Reed, because of his necessary extended absences in his surveying practice. Churton was a representative from Orange in the Colonial Assembly from 1754 until 1762, although he appears not to have been a resident of what was then Childsburg until 1757. He was a town commissioner from 1759 until his death and served as Justice of the Peace after 1757 and likewise was appointed County Surveyor for Orange County in 1757. In 1759, Churton received by an act of the Assembly, four lots of in the town, designated as lots F, G, H and K in the southeastern quadrant, ‚Äúin consideration of the many services he hath performed for the Inhabitants of the said Town, and his Labor, Expense, and Pains in laying out the said Town.‚Äù This grant was reaffirmed in the act of 1766 which renamed the town Hillsborough. Churton was actively engaged in producing a topographic map of the Province of North Carolina from 1757 although he did not himself survey the southern and coastal areas, but relied of ‚Äúinformation and old maps‚Äù. In November 1766, Governor Tryon laid the finished Churton map before the General Assembly which paid Churtons‚Äô fee of 155 Pounds. The Governor assured Churton that if he would endeavor to ‚Äúcomplete and make perfect the southern and maritime parts of the province‚Äô‚Äù he should with Tryon‚Äôs approval take the map to England and present it to the Board of Trade. In 1767, when Churton began to actually survey the coastal areas he discovered that that portion of his map was so defective that he ‚Äúcondemned and cut off that portion.‚Äù Churton died in December 1767 and Governor Tryon caused the work to be completed by Claude Joseph Sauthier and John Abraham Collet, Swiss Engineers and Cartographers, and the work is known today as the ‚ÄúCollet Map‚Äù. Churton Street, the main north-south street in Hillsborough, was named for William Churton. Due to the efforts of Stewart Dunaway, North Carolina Highway Historical Marker G-136 was dedicated to William Churton on November 4, 2017.

History Opened in 1965, the Ice Garden hosts local sporting events (mainly hockey) and concerts. It also has banquet rooms and a restaurant called Murph's Pub. It was a home for Pittsburgh RiverRats indoor football team just for one season (2007) as well for the Mon Valley Thunder of the Mid-Atlantic Hockey League (2007-08). In 2014-15 the arena was the home for the Steel City Warriors of the Federal Hockey League. Current tenants include the Mon Valley Thunder youth hockey association, the Elizabeth Forward Warriors hockey team, Ringgold Rams hockey team, and the Serra Catholic Eagles hockey team. The California University of Pennsylvania Men's and Women's hockey teams play their home games in this arena. The Ice Garden is also famous among wrestling fans as the venue for Extreme Championship Wrestling in the Pittsburgh area in the mid-to-late 90s. Scenes from Kevin Smith's \\"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\\" were filmed here. On April 29, 2017, the Rostraver Ice Garden was nominated to be 2017's Kraft Hockeyville, and later won the national competition, receiving $150,000 in upgrades, along with an opportunity to host an NHL preseason game, which was denied by the NHL and NBC for several reasons, but the Penguins were able to hold a practice & celebration at the arena. Incidents On February 14, 2010, after heavy snowfall in Southwestern Pennsylvania, a 100-by-200-foot section of the roof of the Ice Gardens collapsed during a youth hockey tournament between Canadian and US teams. About five hours after the collapse, officials reported that everyone was accounted for and there were no serious injuries. Local TV stations reported from the scene that the collapse occurred shortly after a loud cracking noise was heard, giving adults enough time to evacuate hundreds of people, mainly children, from the arena before the roof came down. The arena reopened to the public, with a new roof, on October 21, 2010.

The two stars orbit one another elliptically (e=0.44), approaching as close as 4.2 AU and receding to 10.5 AU, with a period of just under twenty years. Due to the high margins of error on the mass estimates for the two stars, these orbital parameters are approximate. HD 10307 A, the larger component, is a G-type main-sequence star similar to the Sun, only slightly brighter, hotter, larger, and older than the Sun‚Äîthough with a slightly smaller mass. It has a low level of activity and is a candidate Maunder minimum analog. HR 483 B, the smaller component, appears to be a red dwarf, with as little as thirty-eight percent the mass of the sun.

It is a further development of the toccata form, which has been used by composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Robert Schumann. Other composers of well-known toccatas include Maurice Ravel, Dmitri Kabalevsky and Aram Khachaturian. Prokofiev's Toccata starts off with a persistent repetition of the note D, interchanged between the right hand (which plays the single note) and the left hand (which plays the same note but with the lower octave as well). After a brief development, there are chromatic leaps in the left hand while the right hand plays a repeated figuration. The two hands soon switch positions, although the leaps still continue for a while. A series of split chromatic thirds leads upwards until a descending melody (in C) with chromatic third accompaniments begins, with the left hand traveling in contrary motion upwards. This leads back to the main repetition 'theme' before a very short pause. Both hands soon play a weaving series of the right hand's repeated figuration from the start, before the split chromatic thirds pattern reappears. This leads more violently to the descending melody pattern, but this time in D, before the D repetition 'theme' reappears, this time in alternating octaves in both hands. The Toccata slows down and halts temporarily before a chromatic rising scale leads to octave exhortations, followed by a glissando sweep up the keyboard to end on the top D. It is an extremely difficult showpiece that is very popular with virtuoso pianists and has been recorded by many. According to the biography of the composer by David Gutman, Prokofiev himself had trouble playing it because his technique, while good, was not quite enough to master the piece. However this fact is not universally accepted and his performance as reproduced in 1997 for the Nimbus Records series The Composer Plays is certainly virtuosic. Additionally none of the leading biographies of Prokofiev, those written by Harlow Robinson, Victor Seroff, and even Israel Nestyev, mention any technical problems with the piano past his childhood born poor performance techniques which were later rectified through years of study after his graduation from the St. Petersburg Conservatory.

B. Brazier (died 1837) was an English surveyor who emigrated to the United States in July 1819. He came as an assistant to Hamilton Fulton who had been hired as Principal Engineer by the North Carolina Board of Internal Improvements. Brazier had received his professional training under John Rennie, the Scottish Civil Engineer who is remembered as the designer of several bridges, including London Bridge, the Plymouth Breakwater and the London and East India docks. Brazier‚Äôs contract with the State was not confirmed until February 1820, although he had been engaged with his duties under Fulton since their arrival. There were those in the Legislature were opposed to any program of tax supported internal improvements. These were mostly Easterners, who attempted to manipulate the program to obtain major benefits to the Eastern region. These efforts were opposed by those from the Central and Western parts of the State. With this political infighting the continued existence of the Board of Internal Improvements itself was in doubt. Brazier applied to the State of Virginia for the post of Principal Engineer to the State of Virginia, which post had recently become vacant. He was endorsed for the position by Governor Gabriel Holmes, William Nichols, Architect, and William Ruffin, but was unsuccessful and continued at his post in North Carolina. From 1820 through 1823, Brazier completed surveys and drew maps, plans, profiles and sections of the principal water courses in the State from the Yadkin to Roanoke Inlet. Late in 1823, he became involved with a dispute with the Board of Internal Improvements regarding his account of expenses. Brazier resigned, effective February 19, 1823 and wrote the Board what they characterized as a ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù letter, demanding settlement of his account. The requested settlement not forthcoming, Brazier entered suit against the State. The Wake County Superior Court found for Brazier and he was awarded damages in 1825. For several years, Brazier worked privately, making a handsome map of Fayetteville, making patent drawings and surveying. Among his surveys during that time was the ‚ÄúBuncombe Turnpike‚Äù from Greenville, South Carolina to Greeneville, Tennessee which was actually funded and completed by the State in 1827. In early 1827, Brazier entered into a contractual relationship with the Board of Internal Improvement to survey swamp lands in Eastern North Carolina. His report was presented to the General Assembly in the late fall of 1827 and his expenses to the Board in early 1828, after which, his connection with the Board came to an end. Again, Brazier worked privately. Among his work during this period was the surveying a route from Raleigh to Cobb‚Äôs Mill (now Wiggin‚Äôs Mill on Contentnea Creek at US 117 in Wilson Co.?) and laying out the Town of Rolesville. In 1826, John McRae of Fayetteville convinced the General Assembly to fund a new map of the State. McRae first attempted to secure the services of one W. H. Hanford of the Corps of Engineers, but this did not avail, and McRae turned to Brazier. By July, 1831, he had completed most of his surveys and the drawing was ready for the engraver in 1832. In 1831, the post of Principal Engineer in Virginia again became vacant. Brazier again applied for the position and was endorsed by the Governor, Montfort Stokes, Senator James Iredell, Jr., state Attorney General Romulus M. Saunders and others, attesting to his skill as a surveyor and expressing the opinion that ‚Äúas a Draughtsman, it is believed that (Brazier) has no superior in the Country.‚Äù This application again failed of success, but he was employed for various surveys in southeastern Virginia. After his arrival in Raleigh, Brazier built a residence in a newly subdivided area just east of the originally laid out city. This house survives today with what is said by the present owner to be the original roof. It is in the south east quadrant of the intersection of Jones and East Streets, presently owned and occupied by W. E. Hutchins. Brazier‚Äôs fortunes declined during the late 1820s. The mortgage on his residence was foreclosed in May 1830, and both real and personal property were lost. By 1833, it became necessary for the Christ Church (Episcopal) charitable fund to come to the aid of his family. His wife, Rachel and his son, James Henderson were Episcopalians. Brazier was, presumably, Anglican. In an effort to recoup his fortunes, in 1834, Brazier, with eleven associates, developed lots in Fayetteville. The venture was not as successful as hoped, and by 1836, Christ Church once again had to come to his aid. Following an ice storm during the Christmas season in 1836, Brazier fell from some steps and died some two weeks later as a result of injuries. The Rector of Christ Church wrote that Brazier had come to his death ‚Äúby his own folly and wickedness,‚Äù though he acknowledged that he was a most excellent draughtsman, ‚Äúwith the talents of an angel‚Äù. Presumably, Brazier was buried in the old City Cemetery. Many maps and surveys by Brazier survive, among which are: * ‚ÄúPlan of the Neuse River from Stone‚Äôs Mill to Major Turner‚Äôs Ferry showing the proposed situation of the Locks and Dams...‚Äù 1819 * ‚ÄúPlan of Croatan and Roanoke Sounds Shewing the Proposed Situations of the Embankment and Inlet‚Äù. 1820 * ‚ÄúPlan and Sections of a Line of Canal from the Tar River to Tossnot (sic) Creek...‚Äù 1820 * ‚ÄúPlan of the Tar River from Louisburg to the Little Falls, Showing the Proposed Situation of the Locks and Dams‚Äù 1821 * ‚ÄúLongitudinal Section of the Catawba River from the Devil‚Äôs Shoals to the Mouth of the Little Catawba River‚Äù 1824 * ‚ÄúPlan of the Catawba River from the Devil‚Äôs Shoal to near Sherrill‚Äôs Ford‚Äù 1824 There are more maps and surveys in the Map Collection of the State Archives.

These range from Wilson having been a Soviet agent (a claim which MI5 investigated and found to be false), to Wilson being the victim of treasonous plots by conservative-leaning elements in MI5, claims which Wilson himself made. Background Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn is said to have told Alec MacDonald, who set up safe houses where Golitsyn could live, that Wilson was a KGB operative and that former Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell had been assassinated by the KGB to have the pro- US Gaitskell replaced as party leader by Wilson.Leigh, p. 80. However, Christopher Andrew, the official historian for Britain's MI5,War and Intelligence Conference has described Golitsyn as an \\"unreliable conspiracy theorist\\".Christopher Andrew, Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries and Deadly Games By Tennent H Bagley Reviewed by Christopher Andrew, The Sunday Times, 24 June 2007 In his memoir Spycatcher (1987), former MI5 officer Peter Wright stated that the head of the CIA's Counterintelligence Division, James Angleton, told him that Wilson was a Soviet agent when Wilson was elected Prime Minister in the 1964 general election. Wright said that Angleton referred to this assertion coming from a source (whom he did not name but who was probably Golitsyn). Golitsyn's words had been frequently taken heed of by Angleton, who had grown suspicious of many political figures' loyalty, such as in the case of Henry Kissinger.Espionage is sublime onscreen, but hardly ever changes history Jeet Heer, Globe and Mail 9 July 2010 According to Wright, Angleton offered to provide further information on the condition that MI5 guarantee to keep the allegations from \\"political circles\\",Wright, p. 364. but the management of MI5 declined to accept restrictions on the use of the information and Angleton told them nothing more. At the end of the 1960s, Wright wrote, MI5 received information from two Czechoslovakian defectors, Josef Frol√≠k and Franti≈°ek August, who had fled to the West, alleging the Labour Party had \\"almost certainly\\" been penetrated by the Soviets. The two named a list of Labour MPs and trade unionists as Soviet agents. MI5 maintained a file on Wilson, under the name of Henry Worthington, repeatedly investigating him over the course of several decades before officially concluding that Wilson had had no relationship with the KGB; nor had it ever found evidence of Soviet penetration of the Labour Party.Michael Evans, \\"Wilson cleared of KGB threat in MI5 inquiry\\", The Times, 4 May 1987. Wilson claimed he was a staunch anti-Communist. The 1968 plot In his 1976 memoir Walking on Water, Hugh Cudlipp recounts a meeting he arranged at the request of Cecil King, the head of the International Publishing Corporation (IPC), between King and Lord Mountbatten of Burma. The meeting took place on 8 May 1968. Attending were Mountbatten, King, Cudlipp, and Sir Solly Zuckerman, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the British government. According to Cudlipp: Mountbatten asked for the opinion of Zuckerman, who stated that the plan amounted to treason and left the room. Mountbatten expressed the same opinion, and King and Cudlipp left.Cudlipp, pp.326‚Äì327. King subsequently decided to override the editorial independence of the Daily Mirror and wrote and instructed to be published a front-page article calling on Wilson to be removed by some sort of extra-parliamentary action. The board of the IPC met and demanded his resignation for this breach of procedure and the damage to the interests of IPC as a public company. He refused, so was dismissed by the board on 30 May 1968. In addition to Mountbatten's refusal to participate in King's mooted plot, there is no evidence of any other conspirators. Cudlipp himself appears to see the meeting as an example of extreme egotism on King's part. A later memoir by Harold Evans, who was editor of The Sunday Times in 1968, said that The Times had egged on King's plans for a coup: William Rees- Mogg called for a coalition in an 8 December 1968 Times editorial entitled \\"The Danger to Britain\\", a day before King visited the Times office.Private Eye, 20 December 1968. A BBC programme The Plot Against Harold Wilson, broadcast in 2006, reported that, in tapes recorded soon after his resignation, Wilson stated that for eight months of his premiership he didn't \\"feel he knew what was going on, fully, in security\\". Wilson alleged two plots, in the late 1960s and mid-1970s respectively. He said that plans had been hatched to install Lord Mountbatten, Prince Charles's great uncle and mentor, as interim prime minister. He also claimed that ex-military leaders had been building up private armies in anticipation of \\"wholesale domestic liquidation\\". On a separate track, elements within MI5 had also, the BBC programme reported, spread \\"black propaganda\\" that Wilson and Marcia Williams (Wilson's private secretary) were Soviet agents, and that Wilson was an IRA sympathiser, apparently with the intention of helping the Conservatives win the 1974 election. Alleged 1974 military coup plot On the BBC television programme The Plot Against Harold Wilson, broadcast on 16 March 2006 on BBC2, it was claimed there were threats of a coup d'√©tat against the Wilson government, which was corroborated by leading figures of the time on both the left and the right. Wilson told two BBC journalists, Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtiour, who recorded the meetings on a cassette tape recorder, that he feared he was being undermined by MI5. The first time was in the late 1960s after the Wilson Government devalued the pound sterling but the threat faded after Conservative leader Edward Heath won the election of 1970. However, after a coal miners' strike Heath decided to hold an election to renew his mandate to govern in February 1974 but lost narrowly to Wilson. There was again talk of a military coup, with rumours of Lord Mountbatten as head of an interim administration after Wilson had been deposed. In 1974 the Army occupied Heathrow Airport on the grounds of training for possible IRA terrorist action at the airport. However Marcia Williams (a senior aide and close friend of Wilson) asserted that the operation was ordered as a practice run for a military takeover or as a show of strength, as the government itself was not informed of such an exercise based around a key point in the nation's transport infrastructure. The Peter Wright allegations and Clockwork Orange Peter Wright claimed that he was confronted by two of his MI5 colleagues and that they said to him: \\"Wilson's a bloody menace and it's about time the public knew the truth\\", and \\"We'll have him out, this time we'll have him out\\". Wright alleged that there was a plan to leak damaging information about Wilson and that this had been approved by \\"up to thirty officers\\". As the 1974 election approached, the plan went, MI5 would leak selective details of the intelligence about Labour leaders, especially Wilson, to \\"sympathetic\\" journalists. According to Wright, MI5 would use their contacts in the press and the trade unions to spread around the idea that Wilson was considered a security risk. The matter was to be raised in Parliament for \\"maximum effect\\". However Wright declined to let them see the files on Wilson and the plan was never carried out; but Wright does claim it was a \\"carbon copy\\" of the Zinoviev Letter which was believed to have helped destabilise the first Labour Government in 1924.Peter Wright, Spycatcher (William Heinemann, 1987), Ibid, p. 369. On 22 March 1987 former MI5 officer James Miller claimed that the Ulster Workers Council Strike of 1974 had been promoted by MI5 to help destabilise Wilson's government. In July 1987, Labour MP, Ken Livingstone used his maiden speech to raise the allegations of a former Army press officer, Colin Wallace, that the Army press office in Northern Ireland had been used in the 1970s as part of a smear campaign, codenamed Clockwork Orange, against Harold Wilson and other British and Irish politicians. Recent scholarship In The Defence of the Realm (2009), the first authorised history of MI5, by Christopher Andrew, it was shown that MI5 kept a file on Wilson from 1945, when he became an MP ‚Äì because communist civil servants claimed that he had similar political sympathies. However, Defence of the Realm claims that there was no conspiracy against Wilson, and repeats the Callaghan government claim that there was no bugging of 10 Downing Street.MI5 kept file on former PM Wilson, BBC News, 3 October 2009 Doubt was cast on this claim, however, in 2010 when newspaper reports made detailed allegations that the bugging of 10 Downing Street had been omitted from the history for \\"wider public interest reasons\\". The government did not issue a denial of the allegations. In 1963 on Harold Macmillan's orders following the Profumo Affair, MI5 bugged the cabinet room, the waiting room, and the prime minister's study until the bugs were removed in 1977 on James Callaghan's orders. From the records it is unclear if Harold Wilson or Edward Heath knew of the bugging, and no recorded conversations were retained by MI5 so possibly the bugs were never activated. Professor Andrew had previously recorded in the preface of the history that \\"One significant excision as a result of these requirements (in the chapter on The Wilson Plot) is, I believe, hard to justify\\", giving credibility to these new allegations. Intelligence historian Jon Moran, concluded in 2014: :The characterisation of Harold Wilson as paranoid does not take account of the political context of the time, which was characterised by a political style generally which applied to both left and right (including MI5 itself). The suspicion of Wilson and others towards the activities of the security services and other figures resulted from concrete domestic and international developments discussed in more detail below. Andrew is correct to be sceptical, and there remains limited evidence of a ‚Äòplot‚Äô, if a plot is defined as a tightly organised high-level conspiracy with a detailed plan. However there is evidence of a conspiracy: a loosely connected series of unlawful manoeuvres against an elected government by a group of like-minded figures.Jon Moran, \\"Conspiracy and contemporary history: revisiting MI5 and the Wilson plot[s].\\" Journal of Intelligence History (2014) 13#2 pp 161-175, quote at p 162.

A skeleton suit was an outfit of clothing for small boys, popular from about 1790 to the late 1820s, after which it increasingly lost favor with the advent of trousers. It consisted of a tight short- or long-sleeved coat or jacket buttoned to a pair of high-waisted trousers. Skeleton suits are often described as one of the earliest fashions to be specifically tailored for children, rather than being adult fashions sized down. Previously (and subsequently) young boys wore dresses until they were breeched, or put into trousers. Charles Dickens describes a skeleton suit as \\"...one of those straight blue cloth cases in which small boys used to be confined, before belts and tunics had come in, and old notions had gone out: an ingenious contrivance for displaying the full symmetry of a boy‚Äôs figure, by fastening him into a very tight jacket, with an ornamental row of buttons over each shoulder, and then buttoning his trousers over it, so as to give his legs the appearance of being hooked on, just under the armpits\\" (Sketches by Boz, 1836). Despite Dickens' assertions, skeleton suits were made in various colors. They were usually worn with a white blouse or shirt trimmed with lace or ruffles.

Thereafter, he returned to Britain. Early years Fulton was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, in 1781 to Hugh Fulton and Barbara Bowy. He worked for John Rennie and for Thomas Telford, both of whom were noted engineers. In the case of the latter, his work included surveys of roads in the Scottish Highlands and in North Wales, as well as work in Sweden and, between 1809‚Äì1810, a survey of the Stamford Canal. It was while he was in Stamford, Lincolnshire, that he married Sarah Collins Martin, on 25 April 1810. In 1815, Fulton journeyed to Bermuda on a commission from the Admiralty. There he reported on the development of naval constructions at the recently acquired dockyard on Ireland Island, Bermuda. He was similarly tasked at Malta in 1817, and both of these ventures were conducted under the instruction of Rennie. Middle years Subsequently, Fulton met Peter Brown from North Carolina. Brown, who was a member of the state's General Assembly, had fruitlessly spent nearly a year in England, searching for a suitably qualified person to take on the role of state engineer. His search had been hampered by the unwillingness of potential candidates to leave their well-provided situations; Fulton, however, was at that time unemployed and agreed to take the post on a salary of ¬£1200 per annum. Fulton's assistant, Robert H. B. Brazier, was also employed, on the lesser salary of ¬£300. Fulton had been recommended for the post by Rennie and Telford. The two men immediately set about their tasks. Fulton examined the coastal inlets, sounds and principal rivers with an eye toward practical improvements in navigation while Brazier conducted the surveys and made maps and plates thereof. As Chairman of the commission, Murphy prepared a memoir of the situation in the state for the information and instruction of Fulton. The first object in view being to render the rivers navigable, not for steamboats, but for flat boats, carrying produce from river landings down the stream to some lower point for shipment. To this end, the Catawba and Yadkin were deemed navigable almost to the mountains. Ashe declares that Murphy's notes to Fulton indicate such a thorough examination of detail and such a copious volume of information that Murphy himself must be considered possessed of considerable engineering acumen. One of Fulton's first recommendations was the reopening of Roanoke Inlet which had been closed since 1795. His report thereon conveys a ready appreciation of Fulton's skill and understanding. He understood the necessity of avoiding any deleterious effect on natural vegetation as well as the natural and mechanical forces necessary to keep such an inlet open once it was re-established. The project failed to be realized, but it remained the basis for state planning until well into the 1840s. Fulton was involved with the construction of the Roanoke Canal. The lower rapids occurs just east of Weldon and extend to above the present City of Roanoke Rapids. At the western edge of Weldon, a small stream known as Chockoyotte Creek enters the river. The proposed canal would have to pass over the creek as it lifted the boats to the higher elevation above the upper rapids. In 1821 Fulton designed the Roanoke Canal aqueduct over Chockoyotte Creek in Halifax County, a structure with a arch, which edifice still stands despite a century of neglect. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Roanoke Canal routed river vessels around the rapids, thus opening the upper reaches of the Roanoke River to commercial navigation. An even more impressive structure designed by Fulton over the Dan River at Milton in Caswell County, consisting of eight elliptical stone arches, has been lost. As well as supervising the execution of his plans for the Roanoke Navigation Co., Fulton spent considerable time attempting to correct the ill-conceived piecemeal construction of the Cape Fear Navigation Co. He also examined and made recommendations on the Wilkesboro‚ÄìTennessee turnpike, the Swannanoa Gap road, and the Cherokee road. He recommended a network of state roads, classified, financed and maintained in the manner now current in the state. Consideration was given to a system of canals which would connect the Yadkin and Catawba rivers to the Cape Fear, thereby giving westerners an outlet to the Atlantic. Political interference with engineering priorities caused no end of difficulties. Every member of the Legislature had a pet project in his district that he wanted immediate action taken on. Further, those from the east wanted to be sure that their area got their fair share of the improvements. They were convinced that since the east paid more taxes than the west, that the projects should be preponderantly in the east. Indeed, there was no shortage of worthwhile projects throughout the state. The net result was that piecemeal work was accomplished here, there and elsewhere, but in very few instances was the work of such a character as to provide perceptible improvement in conditions. In 1822 in his message to the Legislature, Governor Holmes said that for several years we have had the services of an able engineer, who has explored our rivers, pointed out the obstructions to their navigation and given instructions as to how they were to be removed, a zealous and intelligent board, pushing the projects by all the means in their power, and still their progress has been so gradual as to be almost imperceptible. \\"The reason is obvious, we have not concentrated our money in sums sufficiently large to effect the objects to which it has been applied . . . . Had our limited funds been originally directed to a few points of primary and general importance, and nor dispersed in small sums throughout the State, the result would have been more beneficial to every section . . . . For instance, if the channel of the Cape Fear between Wilmington and the bar could have been deepened, so as to allow passage of vessels without the aid of lighters it would have been better. But by dividing our strength so much in attempting to effect everything at once, we have effected comparatively nothing.‚Äù Neither Fulton or the Legislature was satisfied with the operation of the internal improvements program in the state. Political machinations, the willingness of the board and the Legislature to sacrifice quality in a search for an inexpensive work along with the illusionary expectations of the public that expected immediate results from the improvements prevented Fulton from addressing what he felt were more efficacious needs. Local interests prevented the adoption of a systematic statewide scheme. While working at the Roanoke rapids, Fulton became acquainted with Thomas Moore, the Virginia Engineer. Fulton received a more favorable impression of the Virginia program of internal improvements, and when Moore died, Fulton applied for the position. He was unsuccessful and remained as Principal Engineer for North Carolina. According to Powell, at that time, most North Carolinians considered engineering to be a lot of academic stuff, devoid of practical value. The average farmer felt he could take a gang of laborers with spades, drag pans and wagons and dig a canal, or construct a road while the Engineers were figuring on it and drawing a lot of useless plans. Indeed, the existing roads had been constructed and maintained in exactly that manner since before the Revolution, under the direction of the County Court. Fulton's yearly fee of ¬£1200, in gold, amounting to $5,333 plus expenses, aroused no small amount of envy, particularly from politicians. Further, the sources of funds were not yielding as had been hoped. The State was having difficulty collecting on its land sales of the Cherokee tracts, the Bank of New Bern stock declined and further, few of the internal improvement projects paid on any regular basis. In 1825, the House passed a resolution directing the Board to reduce Fulton's salary to $3,300 and to hire his services out to other states as occasion arose. As a result of these frustrations, Fulton resigned in March 1826 and took a similar position in Georgia. There, he discovered he had been engaged by a discredited board, a situation not unlike that in North Carolina, and by the end of the year Fulton found himself in private practice in Milledgeville, at that time the capital of Georgia. Fulton and his family, while in Raleigh, being Anglicans, attended Christ Episcopal Church, and one of his daughters, Julia Jane was born there. Fulton's wife Sarah was greatly admired. David L. Swain wrote that Mrs. Fulton \\"is worth $1000 per annum to Raleigh, & the society of the place would suffer an irreparable loss by her removal.\\" Swain described Fulton as \\"blunt but of very friendly disposition and one of the most scientific men in the country.‚Äù In retrospect, it may have been better that Fulton did not receive proper support from the State in the construction of a canal system. A better system was at hand. In 1825 the first railroad locomotive appeared in the United States. In 1827 Joseph Caldwell published a series of newspaper essays advocating this new system of transportation. They were collected and published the next year in a pamphlet entitled The Numbers of Carlton which caught the public imagination and led to the construction of the first railroads in the state. Last years Fulton suffered from poor health in the climate of the USA and, in 1829, he returned to Britain. There he employed one of his eight children, Hamilton Henry Fulton, as a pupil. In 1832, Fulton made proposals for the construction of a harbor and breakwaters at the coalfield port of Amble in Northumberland. Although these came to nothing, the idea was revived in a different form by Rennie's son, John Rennie the Younger, a few years later. He also worked with Rennie junior on surveys of the railway line between London and Brighton. A Chart and Section of the River Dart, from Totness (Devon, UK) to the Anchor Stone at Langham Wood Point was surveyed, under the direction of Messrs G & J Rennie, by Hamilton Fulton. A plan signed by John Rennie, 14 August 1832. ref. Devon County Records Office, Deposited Plans 101 and 106. The date of the survey is not recorded.

Other differences between routes include the armament of the VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighters (the later upgrades used in the movie route are more well equipped), boss fights (the only constant is a duel with Milia, a Zentradi/Meltrandi ace pilot), and the song that pop idol Lynn Minmay sings during the final battle. In the course of the game, players will occasionally encounter characters from the series, such as receiving briefings from Roy Focker or duelling with Quamzin Kravshera.

It belongs to the administrative district (Regierungsbezirk) of Cologne. Geography Situated south-west of Bonn and south of Cologne, Rheinbach lies at the edge of the Eifel region and within the borders of Rhineland's nature reserve. History Around 80 AD, the Eifel Aqueduct, one of the longest aqueducts of the Roman Empire, was running through what is today Rheinbach's town centre.Klaus Grewe: Aqu√§dukte.

Aus den Quellen herausgegeben von Heinrich Beyer. Erster Band: Von den √§ltesten Zeiten bis zum Jahre 1169. H√∂lscher, Coblenz 1860, S. 20. In the Middle Ages, Rheinbach came to prominence because of its witch-hunts. Timbered houses on the main street First referred to as a town in 1298, the Archbishop of Cologne purchased Rheinbach and the surrounding villages in 1343. Till 1789, Rheinbach was part of the Electorate of Cologne. In 1794, Rheinbach was incorporated into France within the D√©partement de Rhin-et-Moselle before coming under the auspices of Prussia in 1815. Around 1947, a considerable number of displaced people from the Sudetenland settled in Rheinbach. Having brought their traditions of glasscraft, Rheinbach became famous for its glass art and today hosts a glass art museum and a specialized school.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms was made official in 1915 by Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia. The black cross with the silver background stands for the archdiocese of Cologne. The Eagle stems from the coat of arms from the Counts of Are-Hochstaden. The blue key refers to the Holy Saint Peter, the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Cologne.  Governance  Medieval fortification, partly constructed on the remains of the Roman aqueduct Besides the town proper, Rheinbach administratively comprises the surrounding villages and hamlets, including Flerzheim.

Reception Film critic Bosley Crowther dismissed the film as uninteresting, \\"Perhaps it is all the fault of the script, which has our hero vacillating between a life of crime and regeneration via a lady's love and an honest but unremunerative practice. What it all adds up to is a standard romantic melodrama illustrating the facts that crime obviously doesn't pay and that the scenery and people below the border are colorful ... Like its title, One Way Street is explicitly obvious and not especially exciting.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times film review, May 12, 1950. Accessed: August 16, 2013.

He is best known for the eponymously named restaurant Daniel, in New York City, which has two Michelin stars. While raised on a farm outside of Lyon and trained by a variety of French chefs, Boulud made his reputation in New York, first as a chef and most recently a restaurateur. His management company, The Dinex Group, currently includes fifteen restaurants, three locations of a gourmet grocery (Epicerie Boulud) and Feast & F√™tes Catering. His restaurants include Daniel, Caf√© Boulud, db bistro moderne, Bar Boulud, DBGB Kitchen & Bar, and Boulud Sud.

It is situated on the river Sieg, approx. 25 km east of Bonn city. History Early History The area encompassing Eitorf was originally inhabited by the Sicambri, who were ultimately almost completely annihilated by the Romans. The area belonged to the unoccupied german settlement regionGermania Libera. Afterwards, the Ripuarian Franks emerged from the Tenkterer and other Frankish people in the region and would go on to have a lengthy and complex relationship with the Romans ‚Äì first as their opponents, then their vassals, and finally their heirs in ruling over all of France and Germany. The names of Frankish settlements from the time frequently have an -ingen ending, of which K√∂ttingen is the only remaining local example. Upon the splitting of the Frankish Kingdom under Charlemagne, the area belonged first to the Kingdom of Louis the German and later to the Duchy of Lorraine. Under the Ottonian Dyanasty, the area belonged to the Duchy of Lower Lorraine in the Holy Roman Empire. Under Emperor Maximilian I, the Rhine-Sieg district belonged to the Lower Rhine District, which spread from the Maas to Bremen. The Duchy of Berg later arose in this same area. Middle Ages The first documented mention of Eitorf comes from a document by Holy Roman Emperor Conrad III of Germany in which the Stift of Vilich was confirmed, among other things, to have received the Villa Eidtorph in 978. There were several manor homes that were constructed in the area, including Welterode Fortress, part of which remains to this day. Modern Era In the 16th Century, Eitorf became the Seat of a Landesgericht. Eitorf was affected by several wars including the Thirty Years' War, during which one out of every three inhabitants died in 1631.

So, he develops a scheme to commit identity theft (though this term was not used for the crime in 1992) with the credit card information of deceased cardholders to which he has access due to his mailroom position.

Reception The film had a mostly negative reception. Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times recalled that \\"there are amusing things in 'Mo‚Äô Money'‚Äîthe chemistry of the Wayans team, the paterfamilias routine of Joe Santos as a good cop, the piquant sexiness of Stacey Dash‚Äîbut they get steamrollered by all the high- tech crash-bang movie machismo.\\" Hal Hinson wrote in The Washington Post that Wayans, \\"the 'In Living Color' star, who wrote and executive-produced this new picture, has a handful of these sublimely blank moments in 'Mo' Money,' but not nearly enough to anesthetize us to the film's painful deficiencies.\\" The New York Times' Janet Maslin wrote that \\"the film would have been helped by more directorial spark than is supplied by Peter MacDonald, who is effectively stumped by the screenplay's split personality. Some of the material is played as comedy [...] but a lot of the film hinges on some intrigue involving a corporate swindle, and neither the scheme nor the villains are compelling.\\" The film received a slightly more favorable review from Variety, which stated that the \\"loosely structured film has trouble meshing its very funny gag scenes with rough action footage, but it should earn mucho change from escapist fans.\\" It holds a rating of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 25 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mo_money Box office The film debuted at No. 1 at the box office in the United States, grossing $12,385,415 during its opening weekend.

It states that every function that results from the differentiation of another function has the intermediate value property: the image of an interval is also an interval. When ∆í is continuously differentiable (∆í in C1([a,b])), this is a consequence of the intermediate value theorem. But even when ∆í‚Ä≤ is not continuous, Darboux's theorem places a severe restriction on what it can be. Darboux's theorem Let I be a closed interval, f\\\\colon I\\\\to \\\\R a real-valued differentiable function. Then f' has the intermediate value property: If a and b are points in I with a, then for every y between f'(a) and f'(b), there exists an x in (a,b) such that f'(x)=y.Apostol, Tom M.: Mathematical Analysis: A Modern Approach to Advanced Calculus, 2nd edition, Addison-Wesley Longman, Inc. (1974), page 112.Olsen, Lars: A New Proof of Darboux's Theorem, Vol. 111, No. 8 (Oct., 2004) (pp. 713‚Äì715), The American Mathematical MonthlyRudin, Walter: Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition, MacGraw-Hill, Inc. (1976), page 108 Proofs Proof 1. The first proof is based on the extreme value theorem. If y equals f'(a) or f'(b), then setting x equal to a or b, respectively, gives the desired result. Now assume that y is strictly between f'(a) and f'(b), and in particular that f'(a)>y>f'(b). Let \\\\varphi\\\\colon I\\\\to \\\\R such that \\\\varphi(t)=f(t)-yt. If it is the case that f'(a) we adjust our below proof, instead asserting that \\\\varphi has its minimum on [a,b]. Since \\\\varphi is continuous on the closed interval [a,b], the maximum value of \\\\varphi on [a,b] is attained at some point in [a,b], according to the extreme value theorem. Because \\\\varphi'(a)=f'(a)-y> 0, we know \\\\varphi cannot attain its maximum value at a. (If it did, then (\\\\varphi(t)-\\\\varphi(a))/(t-a) \\\\leq 0 for all t \\\\in [a,b] , which implies \\\\varphi'(a) \\\\leq 0 .) Likewise, because \\\\varphi'(b)=f'(b)-y<0, we know \\\\varphi cannot attain its maximum value at b. Therefore, \\\\varphi must attain its maximum value at some point x\\\\in(a,b). Hence, by Fermat's theorem, \\\\varphi'(x)=0, i.e. f'(x)=y. Proof 2. The second proof is based on combining the mean value theorem and the intermediate value theorem. Define c = \\\\frac{1}{2} (a + b). For a \\\\leq t \\\\leq c, define \\\\alpha (t) = a and \\\\beta (t) = 2t - a. And for c \\\\leq t \\\\leq b, define \\\\alpha (t) = 2t - b and \\\\beta(t) = b. Thus, for t \\\\in (a,b) we have a \\\\leq \\\\alpha (t) < \\\\beta (t) \\\\leq b. Now, define g(t) = \\\\frac{(f \\\\circ \\\\beta)(t) - (f \\\\circ \\\\alpha)(t)}{\\\\beta(t) - \\\\alpha(t)} with a < t < b. \\\\, g is continuous in (a, b). Furthermore, g(t) \\\\rightarrow {f}' (a) when t \\\\rightarrow a and g(t) \\\\rightarrow {f}' (b) when t \\\\rightarrow b; therefore, from the Intermediate Value Theorem, if y \\\\in ({f}' (a), {f}' (b)) then, there exists t_0 \\\\in (a, b) such that g(t_0) = y. Let's fix t_0. From the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point x \\\\in (\\\\alpha (t_0), \\\\beta (t_0)) such that {f}'(x) = g(t_0). Hence, {f}' (x) = y. Darboux function A Darboux function is a real-valued function ∆í which has the \\"intermediate value property\\": for any two values a and b in the domain of ∆í, and any y between ∆í(a) and ∆í(b), there is some c between a and b with ∆í(c) = y. By the intermediate value theorem, every continuous function on a real interval is a Darboux function. Darboux's contribution was to show that there are discontinuous Darboux functions. Every discontinuity of a Darboux function is essential, that is, at any point of discontinuity, at least one of the left hand and right hand limits does not exist. An example of a Darboux function that is discontinuous at one point is the topologist's sine curve function: :x \\\\mapsto \\\\begin{cases}\\\\sin(1/x) & \\\\text{for } x e 0, \\\\ 0 &\\\\text{for } x=0. \\\\end{cases} By Darboux's theorem, the derivative of any differentiable function is a Darboux function. In particular, the derivative of the function x \\\\mapsto x^2\\\\sin(1/x) is a Darboux function even though it is not continuous at one point. An example of a Darboux function that is nowhere continuous is the Conway base 13 function. Darboux functions are a quite general class of functions. It turns out that any real-valued function ∆í on the real line can be written as the sum of two Darboux functions.Bruckner, Andrew M: Differentiation of real functions, 2 ed, page 6, American Mathematical Society, 1994 This implies in particular that the class of Darboux functions is not closed under addition. A strongly Darboux function is one for which the image of every (non-empty) open interval is the whole real line. The Conway base 13 function is again an example.

Its origin is in the island culture of Greece. Men could not approach women easily, so they created this dance in order to \\"flirt\\" with them. There are various forms of the ballos around the islands. The simplest is one in which a single couple goes through a series of spontaneous figures. In another version many couples dance simultaneously as if alone on the dance floor. Yet another version is introduced by a Sirtos. In its most complicated form, a number of couples go through various figures, somewhat reminiscent of the European minuet. Ballos songs are popular and there are many of them.

It is regulated under the Water Industry Act 1991. Sewerage services in the Bristol area are provided by Wessex Water. Approximately half the water is taken from the Mendip Hills, particularly Chew Valley Lake, Blagdon Lake, Cheddar Reservoir and Barrow Gurney Reservoirs, with the other half piped from the River Severn via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. There are of local water mains. History During the medieval period, Bristol had a remarkably efficient water supply, as there were a large number of wells and springs, and most streets had a wooden trough into which water was discharged. The troughs were supplied by local priories, as most of the wells and springs were also owned by religious foundations, but with the Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1541, maintenance and upkeep of the system passed to parishes. As the population increased, they proved inadequate and started to become polluted. The first Bristol Waterworks Company was set up in 1695, and obtained water from Hanham Mills, on the edge of the city limits, which was piped into the main part of the city in hollowed-out elm pipes. The scheme was completed in 1698, but never worked well, as the company was not well organised or managed, and it gradually got into serious debt. The Corporation of Bristol were unwilling to take over the scheme, and the company became bankrupt in 1782. The need for fresh water increased significantly between 1804 and 1809, when William Jessop carried out work to improve the facilities of Bristol Harbour, known as the Floating Harbour because water levels were unaffected by the tides. Large numbers of extra ships used the facilities, and needed their water tanks to be filled before putting back out to sea. There was an idea to build a canal from the Kennet and Avon Canal near Bath into Bristol, which would be used by boats and also as a water supply channel, but that scheme failed due to lack of funds after obtaining and enabling Act of Parliament in 1811. A Commission was appointed in 1844 to consider the state of large towns in England, and reported that Bristol was one of the worst large towns in respect of water supply. Most water came from wells, the water was hard, making it unsuitable for washing, and the diffictly of obtaining the water meant that it was used very sparingly. By the spring of 1845, there were two groups attempting to supply Bristol with water. The Merchant Venturers Company had proposed a scheme to supply the area of Clifton with water from two springs on the banks of the River Avon. Although that scheme had not been authorised in 1842, their proposal was to extend it, and they had enlisted the support of Isambard Kingdom Brunel as engineer. Edwin Chadwick and Thomas Hawksley had failed to persuade them that they should implement a combined water supply and drainage scheme, as just supplying water often led to worse sanitary conditions, with cesspits overflowing if there was no network of sewers to carry waste away. The second group proposed bringing water from the Mendip Hills and other springs in Somerset, and after some consideration of various engineers at a meeting held in the Bristol Corn Exchange on 20 June 1845, appointed James Simpson, based on his wide experience of water supply projects. In the ensuing Parliamentary battle, the second group won, becoming the Bristol Water Company. Line of works The company, formally known as Bristol Waterworks Company, was formed on 16 July 1846 by an Act of Parliament. The first general meeting was held in the White Lion Hotel on Broad Street, when members of the first committee included William Budd, a physician who helped control cholera outbreaks in Bristol, and Francis Fry of the Fry family, better known for producing chocolate. The 1846 Act authorised the construction of Simpson's \\"Line of Works\\", an aqueduct designed to carry water from Chewton and Litton to Barrow Gurney. A network of open-jointed drains and culverts were constructed at Chewton and Litton, to collect water from springs, which were located at a level some above that of Bristol Harbour. These fed into an egg-shaped masonry culvert, which followed the contours of the land for , and was built by the cut-and-cover method. This fed into a tunnel cut through a ridge of magnesium limestone conglomerate, after which a rivetted wrought iron tube carried the water over the Harptree ravine. This section is long, and is carried on stone piers nearly above the valley floor. There are three further tunnels, with a combined length of , two more wrought iron sections to cross ravines, both long, and of cast iron pipes. The pipes had an average gradient of around 10 inches per mile (16 cm per km), but the gradient was not uniform, and there was a high point on Breach Hill Lane, to the south of Chew Stoke. To prevent an air lock forming, an open vent was constructed, sufficiently high to ensure that water could not escape through it, and a stone obelisk was constructed around it, standing high. A reservoir was constructed at Barrow Gurney to receive the water, and because the springs at Chewton were the source of the River Chew, the company was required to build three compensation reservoirs, so that the flow in the river could be maintained. Two were constructed at Litton, with a third on the Winford Brook near Chew Magna. Water was fed into the supply system from three service reservoirs. Cotham reservoir was fed by gravity from Barrow Gurney, and some of its water was then pumped to Durdham Down reservoir, which was outside the city limits at the time. The third reservoir at Bedminster Down supplied the district to the south of the harbour, and was fed by gravity from Cold Bath spring, a little to the west of Barrow Gurney. The construction work was finished in 1851, and was designed to deliver per day, but by 1860 the company had realised that this was not achievable in dry years. In 1862 they therefore obtained another Act of Parliament to authorise the construction of a second reservoir at Barrow. However, there was very little rain in the winters of 1861, 1862 and 1863, resulting in the yield from the springs that fed the first reservoir being seriously depleted. With the second reservoir not yet completed, they resorted to obtaining water from any springs that they could, but even with temporary pumping, they could not supply more than per day. The 1862 Act also required them to build a compensation reservoir at Barrow Gurney, to enable mills to keep operating. Barrow No. 2 reservoir was finished in 1866, and the two reservoirs could store , representing 88 days at the maximum rate of supply. Meanwhile, they had obtained the Bristol Waterworks Amendments Act 1865, which allowed them to obtain water from springs at Chelvey and Migdel, several miles to the west of Barrow Gurney. Simpson anticipated that they might need to extract ground water in due course, and sited the Chelvey pumping station at a location where wells could be driven down into the underlying red sandstone. Aqueducts were constructed to bring Water from the springs to the pumping station, which could pump per day to Barrow Gurney, using two pumps. They began to be run intermittently from May 1867, and were in regular use from July 1868. Simpson did not live to see wells being constructed, as he died in 1869, but work began in the following year, and many wells and boreholes were eventually constructed. Better pumps and steam engines were installed, enabling the station to pump per day. The original pumps were scrapped in 1937. Development Water providers that amalgamated with Bristol Water (1952-1964) Women were first employed at Bristol Waterworks during the First World War. By April 1942 female staff had entirely replaced men on night telephone duty. Years of planning and design work for the Chew Valley Lake Scheme as a reservoir for the city culminated in the obtaining of the Bristol Waterworks Act 1939 on 28 July 1939. It was the largest and most expensive project in the company's history, but less than two months later, the Second World War began, and all capital work was suspended until it was over. The first sod was cut on 10 July 1946, as part of the centenary celebrations of the company. The temporary intake, pumping station and link to the line of works had been authorised in 1944 during a severe drought, although the full scheme as described in the 1939 Act would not receive permission to proceed until 1948. Queen Elizabeth II inaugurated Chew Valley Lake on 17 April 1956, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh. On 24 November 1940 the Bristol Blitz caused 95 fractured water mains in the city but by 28 November the water system in the city was restored to normal. During the 1950s and 1960s, the area supplied by Bristol Waterworks increased steadily. Portishead District Water Company was taken over on 1 January 1952, Long Ashton Rural District Council (RDC) followed on 1 April 1952 and Clevedon Water Company on 1 January 1953. These acquisitions meant that they were supplying an area of . The company agreed to supply water in bulk to a number of smaller water supply undertakings, and based on the fact that Chew Valley Lake would soon be completed, agreed to supply a total of per day to Weston- super-Mare Urban District Council (UDC), Clutton RDC, Norton Radstock UDC and Wells RDC. Discussions on amalgamation with West Gloucester Waterworks Company had begun in 1955, but on 26 September 1956, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government published a circular suggesting that the existing water supply undertakings in the country, then numbering over 1,000, should be radically reduced. Amalgamation with West Gloucester was agreed, and most of the 16 water supply undertakings in the Mendip Hills started negotiating with Bristol Waterworks. In 1957, agreements for takeover were concluded with Axbridge RDC, Shepton Mallet Waterworks Company and Glastonbury Corporation, and discussions with five other undertakings were well advanced. Actual amalgamations took place on 1 January 1959 with Shepton Mallet Waterworks Company, who had just celebrated their centenary on 12 December 1958, with Glastonbury Corporation on 1 April 1959, with West Gloucestershire Water Company on 1 July 1959 and with Wells RDC on 1 October 1959. This resulted in the company supply a population of 680,000, spread over an area of . The water supply undertakings run by Clutton RDC and Shepton Mallet RDC were taken over on 1 April 1960, with Weston-super-Mare following on 1 October 1960. The population supplied increased to 802,000 over an area of with the takeover of Tetbury RDC and Wells City waterworks on 1 April 1961. Further expansion took place on 1 April 1962, when Frome RDC was taken over, and the undertakings of Frome UDC, Street UDC and Burnham-on-Sea UDC following on 1 October. Bathavon Rural District was taken over on 1 April 1963, and the final major takeover was of Norton Radstock UDC on 1 April 1964, increasing the area of supply to , subsequently reduced to as a result of some minor changes. The severe winter of 1962 caused 668 burst mains across the company's supply area in 76 days. Water had to be carted through the streets of Bristol to try and meet demand. In April 1963 a reception at the Council House thanked staff, contractors, drivers and volunteers who had helped. On 5 October 2011, a subsidiary of Capstone Infrastructure Corporation acquired a 70% interest in Bristol Water from Grupo Agbar, who retained a 30% interest in the company. On 10 May 2012, a subsidiary of Itochu Corporation acquired a 20% indirect interest in Bristol Water. Today, iCON Infrastructure have agreed to acquire a 30 percent stake in Bristol Water from Suez, bringing the 10-year relationship with Agbar (now part of Suez) to a natural end, following the takeover in 2006 and the sale of a 70 percent stake in 2011. In 2018, Bristol Water was owned by iCON Infrastructure Partners III, L.P. (50 percent), iCON Infrastructure Partners III (Bristol), L.P. (30 percent) and Itochu Corporation (20 percent) and is a plc with company number 02662226. Bristol Water is one of very few water companies in the UK that has remained in private ownership since its inception.

To this date, Carousel Columbia (the California counterpart) is the world's tallest carousel. History In recent years a stage has been set up in front of the carousels at both parks. The first Columbia opened in the Santa Clara park in 1976 and the Gurnee Columbia opened later that year. The carousel is known as Carousel Columbia at California's Great America and Columbia Carousel at Six Flags Great America. In 1994, Santa Clara's Columbia received some minor renovations for its appearance in the movie Beverly Hills Cop III, filmed at the theme park. In the early 2000s both carousels received touches of red and blue paint. The original paint scheme was white with gold trim, however, some of the gold trim still remains. In the 2011/2012 off-season, Carousel Columbia at California's Great America was re-painted. During the 40 seasons celebration at Six Flags Great America, Columbia Carousel was repainted. Design The original design of the carousel, then named \\"The Columbia\\", was carried out by Randall Duell Associates. Additional scrollwork and decorations were designed by Chris Mueller. Each of the 106 horses, chariots, and animals on the carousels is a replica of one of the world's most famous carved carousel animals. A large reflecting pond was installed in front of each carousel with historic replicas of American flags flying along the sides of the pond. Today, the flags still fly. Sixteen original oil paintings by George Gibson are installed on each carousel, depicting scenes from American history. Kris Rowberry publicized the fact, originally from the press release, that elements from Carousel Columbia were originally used on the sets of the films Marie Antoinette (1938) and The Swan (1956). At tall, the Carousel Columbia in Santa Clara is the tallest carousel in the world. The sister Columbia Carousel in Gurnee stands just one foot shorter at . The two sister carousels may be distinguished by the color of the roof ‚Äì the Carousel Columbia in California is painted gold, while the Columbia Carousel in Illinois is green ‚Äì and the flooring ‚Äì Gurnee's carousel has carpet, while Santa Clara's has a wood floor. The Columbia is often associated with the Carousel Song, written especially for the Marriott's Great America theme parks by Gene Patrick. The Carousel Song still plays at the Santa Clara park periodically throughout the day while it only plays at the Gurnee park soon before the park closes. Animals Seating on the carousel consists of the following 106 fiberglass replicas: * 82 jumping horses * 6 standing horses * 3 chariots * 1 camel * 1 giraffe * 1 lion * 1 tiger * 1 dragon * 1 deer * 1 seahorse * 2 jumping ostriches * 2 jumping pigs * 2 jumping cats * 2 jumping rabbits The horses include cavalry- style horses, Parker horses, Dentzel horses, and the 1928 \\"Silver Anniversary Horse\\" originally carved for the 25th anniversary of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (found on the Gurnee carousel only). The original 1928 armored horse is displayed in the Circus Hall of Fame. The chariots are replicas of chariots originally carved in 1918 by Daniel Carl Muller.

The guy's just really that much better than everybody else.\\" and Conrad Anker said, \\"We're all at this one level, and then there's Alex.\\" Lowe himself said \\"The best climber in the world is the one having the most fun!\\"americanalpineclub.org, pdf version of AAJ 2000, p. 441 (the motto of In memoriam: Alex Lowe 1958-1999, pp. 441-443, by Gordon Wiltsie). Lowe improved his upper body strength as a result of an exercise regimen that included 400 chin-ups and hundreds of dips. In an article for Active Lifestyle, Gordon Wiltsie, a photographer who climbed with Lowe in Antarctica and Canada's Baffin Island, said, \\"he'd hog the pull-up bar to knock out 400 pull-ups in sets of 40 and 45. He disliked downtime and knew where to do pull-ups in many airports. Even on expeditions, when rest is hard to come by and much appreciated, Lowe was an oddball. He'd cop pull-ups on a ship's rigging en route to Antarctica, or do dips in a snow pit he dug at base camp.\\" In that article, Wiltsie said, \\"At Baffin Island, after hauling supplies to a high point on a climb, we went back to camp beat and tired, but Alex proceeded to do pull-up after pull-up. He even brought an exercise device on climbs.\\" He was known jokingly as \\"Lungs With Legs\\" and \\"The Mutant\\" for his incredible strength and stamina. Rescue on Denali In June 1995, Lowe helped the National Park Service rescue several Spanish climbers on Denali in Alaska. On 9 June, the group had been trapped for four days at . Before a rescue team could assemble, one of the climbers fell to his death from the mountain's Upper West Rib. The surviving climbers were all suffering from hypothermia. Lowe, Mark Twight and Scott Backes were lifted by military helicopter to a plateau above the Spaniards, scaled down a 400-vertical foot, 50-degree slope of ice and rock, to reach them and determined that one needed immediate evacuation. Amid snowy conditions, he at first dragged, then carried him on his back up the steep slope at high altitude. Death on Shishapangma Shishapangma Shishapangma In September 1999, Lowe, Conrad Anker and David Bridges (a two-time US national paragliding champion) traveled to the Himalayan giant Shishapangma, the fourteenth highest peak in the world, as part of the 1999 American Shishapangma Ski Expedition. Plans called for Lowe and Anker to be part of the team that would ski down, to become the first Americans to ski down from the summit of an 8,000-meter peak; while Bridges was part of a three-man film team that was to shoot an NBC documentary of the expedition for The North Face. Lowe commented: > \\"It's been a passionate goal of mine to ski off an 8,000 meter peak. I guess > there's a lot of people sort of looking to do this and try to ski off > Everest. But for me, it's got to be an aesthetic and quality run. And > Shishapangma has the best ski line of any of the 8,000 meter peaks. It's > just an absolutely straight shot right down the Southwest Face. That's going > to be a good one.\\" On 5 October, they split into two teams as they searched for a route up the mountain. Lowe's group (Lowe, Anker and Bridges) were crossing a flat glacier when a large serac broke loose above and tumbled downhill. The -wide avalanche swept over the three men. Anker was thrown by the windblast, and suffered a lacerated head, two broken ribs, and dislocated shoulder, but emerged from the snow, and led a 20 hours rescue attempt in the large debris field measuring up to deep. Neither body was found at the time, but almost seventeen years later on 27 April 2016, climbers Ueli Steck and David G√∂ttler, came across the remains of the two climbers emerging from the glacier. Memorial fund Lowe was survived by his wife Jennifer and three sons, Max, Sam, and Isaac. The Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation was established in his honor to provide direction and financial support to humanitarian programs in mountain regions around the world. Their work includes the Khumbu Climbing Center for indigenous people of Nepal.\\"The Believers\\", Conrad Anker, December 2005, Outside Magazine. Jennifer Lowe-Anker published a memoir, Forget Me Not in 2008, that recounts her life shared with Lowe, his death and the life she continued with Anker. Forget Me Not won the National Outdoor Book award for literature in 2008.\\"2008: Outdoor Literature Category\\", noba-web.org Climbing achievements and recognition In 1995, Lowe received the American Alpine Club's Underhill Award for outstanding mountaineering achievement, the highest honor in U.S. mountaineering. He climbed for nearly 10 years with The North Face professional climbing team, which included in the later years mountaineer Jon Krakauer, author of the bestseller Into Thin Air. After Lowe's death, Outside Magazine posthumously declared him \\"the world's best climber,\\" adding, \\"No matter how jaw-dropping his routes, Lowe's real genius grew out of the way he combined physical accomplishments with an indomitable spirit.\\" Alex Lowe Peak Formerly known by its elevation as Peak 10,031, Alex Lowe Peak, south of Bozeman, Montana in the Gallatin National Forest was officially named after him in September 2005.everestnews.com \\"Alex Lowe Peak\\": A Mountain Honoring a Mountaineer [with photograph, localization and the climbing history of the peak] (retrieved March 27, 2010).alexlowe.org/peak.shtml \\"Alex Lowe Peak\\": A Mountain Honoring a Mountaineer.

It is their tenth official studio album, discounting compilations such as Unlimited Edition. Context The band's previous album Saw Delight was the first to include former Traffic members Rosko Gee and Rebop Kwaku Baah. Founding bassist and producer Holger Czukay was reduced to the position of making electronic sounds as Gee took over the bass duties. Czukay left the band during the recording sessions for what was to become Out of Reach. Style As a partial result of Czukay's departure, the new members are said to dominate the group's sound on this album (or \\"to impose too strict a sense of rhythm on Can's once free-flowing music\\", according to an interview). Critically acclaimed drummer Jaki Liebezeit's beats are greatly reduced in their power in relation to Baah's percussion. However, the album's strong guitar solos from Michael Karoli are a link to the older Can sound, and have drawn comparisons to those of Carlos Santana. Gee has also been praised as creating a jazz sound, but equally Out of Reach has been criticized for delving into a disco style. Music Rosko Gee takes lead vocals on \\"Pauper's Daughter and I\\" (quoting the \\"Jack and Jill\\" nursery rhyme) and \\"Give Me No 'Roses'\\", and is credited with writing these two tracks, although according to a 1997 interview with the band in Mojo magazine, this lack of collaboration with the rest of the group was a sign that the band was about to collapse. Rebop sings on the track \\"Like INOBE GOD\\", which has been called Can's worst-ever recorded piece. The four other songs (\\"Serpentine\\", \\"November\\", \\"Seven Days Awake\\" and \\"One More Day\\") are instrumental. Reissued versions Out of Reach has variously been reissued as a double CD with Can's 1979 self-titled release Can (also known as Inner Space after the band's recording studio) and on its own in several single CD versions, e.g. on MagMid (TKO Magnum Music) in the United Kingdom,Channel 4 SlashMusic but was long more difficult to find than other Can albums. Being the only Can album that features no input from Holger Czukay (its followup Can had some editing by Czukay), it was disowned by the band for many years - hence its rather haphazard reissue history - and was not listed as part of their discography on their official website. It was not issued either as part of Spoon Records' first CD reissues of most of their albums in 1989, nor in a remastered Super Audio CD edition in 2006 unlike all the other Can studio albums. It was finally officially re-issued by Spoon Records, in CD, vinyl and digital formats, on 18 August 2014.

An enormous haplogroup spanning all the continents, the macro-haplogroup M, like its sibling the macro-haplogroup N, is a descendant of the haplogroup L3. All mtDNA haplogroups considered native outside of Africa are descendants of either haplogroup M or its sibling haplogroup N. Haplogroup M is relatively young, having a younger most recent common ancestor date than some subclades of haplogroup N such as haplogroup R. Origins There is a debate concerning the geographical origins of Haplogroup M and its sibling haplogroup N. Both lineages are thought to have been the main surviving lineages involved in the out of Africa migration (or migrations) because all indigenous lineages found outside Africa belong to haplogroup M or haplogroup N. Scientists are unsure whether the mutations that define haplogroups M and N occurred in Africa before the exit from Africa or in Asia after the exit from Africa. Determining the origins of haplogroup M is further complicated by an early back-migration (from Asia to Africa) of bearers of M1. Its date of origin in absolute terms is only known with great uncertainty, as reconstruction has yielded different (but overlapping) ranges for the age of M in South Asia and East Asia. Soares et al. (2009) give 95% CI ranges of and for South and East Asia, respectively. The same authors give an estimate for the age of L3 as , later (2011) narrowed to the somewhat younger . Thus, haplogroup M would have emerged around 10,000 or at most 20,000 years after L3, around or somewhat after the recent out-of- Africa migration event. Haplogroup M1 Much discussion concerning the origins of haplogroup M has been related to its subclade haplogroup M1, which is the only variant of macro-haplogroup M found in Africa. Two possibilities were being considered as potential explanations for the presence of M1 in Africa: # M was present in the ancient population which later gave rise to both M1 in Africa, and M more generally found in Eurasia. # The presence of M1 in Africa is the result of a back-migration from Asia which occurred sometime after the Out of Africa migration. Haplogroup M23 In 2009, two independent publications reported a rare, deep-rooted subclade of haplogroup M, referred to as M23, that is present in Madagascar. The contemporary populations of Madagascar were formed in the last 2,000 years by the admixture of Bantu and Indonesian (Austronesian) populations. M23 seems to be restricted to Madagascar, as it has not been detected anywhere else. M23 could have been brought to Madagascar from Asia where most deep rooted subclades of Haplogroup M are found. Asian origin hypothesis According to this theory, anatomically modern humans carrying ancestral haplogroup L3 lineages were involved in the Out of Africa migration from East Africa into Asia. Somewhere in Asia, the ancestral L3 lineages gave rise to haplogroups M and N. The ancestral L3 lineages were then lost by genetic drift as they are infrequent outside Africa. The hypothesis that Asia is the origin of macrohaplogroup M is supported by the following: #The highest frequencies worldwide of macrohaplogroup M are observed in Asia, specifically in Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Nepal where frequencies range from 60 to 80%. The total frequency of M subclades is even higher in some populations of Siberia or the Americas, but these small populations tend to exhibit strong genetic drift effects, and often their geographical neighbors exhibit very different frequencies.Thangaraj et al. (2006), In situ origin of deep rooting lineages of mitochondrial Macrohaplogroup 'M' in India, BMC Genomics 2006, 7:151 #Deep time depth >50,000 years of western, central, southern and eastern Indian haplogroups M2, M38, M54, M58, M33, M6, M61, M62 and the distribution of macrohaplogroup M, do not rule out the possibility of macrohaplogroup M arising in Indian population. #With the exception of the African specific M1, India has several M lineages that emerged directly from the root of haplogroup M. #Only two subclades of haplogroup M, M1 and M23, are found in Africa, whereas numerous subclades are found outside Africa (with some discussion possible only about sub-clade M1, concerning which see below). #Specifically concerning M1 ::*Haplogroup M1 has a restricted geographic distribution in Africa, being found mainly in North Africans and East Africa at low or moderate frequencies. If M had originated in Africa around, or before, the Out of Africa migration, it would be expected to have a more widespread distribution ::*According to Gonzalez et al. 2007, M1 appears to have expanded relatively recently. In this study M1 had a younger coalescence age than the Asian-exclusive M lineages. ::*The geographic distribution of M1 in Africa is predominantly North African/supra-equatorial and is largely confined to Afro-Asiatic speakers,Olivieri et al. (2006), The mtDNA legacy of the Levantine early Upper Palaeolithic in Africa, Science. 2006 Dec 15;314(5806):1767-70 which is inconsistent with the Sub-Saharan distribution of sub-clades of haplogroups L3 and L2 that have similar time depths. ::*One of the basal lineages of M1 lineages has been found in Northwest Africa and in the Near East but is absent in East Africa. ::*M1 is not restricted to Africa. It is relatively common in the Mediterranean, peaking in Iberia. M1 also enjoys a well-established presence in the Middle East, from the South of the Arabian Peninsula to Anatolia and from the Levant to Iran. In addition, M1 haplotypes have occasionally been observed in the Caucasus and the Trans Caucasus, and without any accompanying L lineages. M1 has also been detected in Central Asia, seemingly reaching as far as Tibet. ::*The fact that the M1 sub-clade of macrohaplogroup M has a coalescence age which overlaps with that of haplogroup U6 (a Eurasian haplogroup whose presence in Africa is due to a back-migration from West Asia) and the distribution of U6 in Africa is also restricted to the same North African and Horn African populations as M1 supports the scenario that M1 and U6 were part of the same population expansion from Asia to Africa. ::*The timing of the proposed migration of M1 and U6-carrying peoples from West Asia to Africa (between 40,000 to 45,000 ybp) is also supported by the fact that it coincides with changes in climatic conditions that reduced the desert areas of North Africa, thereby rendering the region more accessible to entry from the levant. This climatic change also temporally overlaps with the peopling of Europe by populations bearing haplogroup U5, the European sister clade of haplogroup U6. African origin hypothesis According to this theory, haplogroups M and N arose from L3 in an East African population ancestral to eurasians that had been isolated from other African populations before the OOA event. Members of this population were involved in the out Africa migration and may have only carried M and N lineages. With the possible exception of haplogroup M1, all other M and N clades in Africa were lost due to admixture with other African populations and genetic drift. The African origin of Haplogroup M is supported by the following arguments and evidence. #L3, the parent clade of haplogroup M, is found throughout Africa, but is rare outside Africa. According to Toomas Kivisild (2003), \\"the lack of L3 lineages other than M and N in India and among non-African mitochondria in general suggests that the earliest migration(s) of modern humans already carried these two mtDNA ancestors, via a departure route over the Horn of Africa.\\" #Specifically concerning at least M1: ::This study provides evidence that M1, or its ancestor, had an Asiatic origin. The earliest M1 expansion into Africa occurred in northwestern instead of northeastern areas; this early spread reached the Iberian Peninsula even affecting the Basques. The majority of the M1a lineages found outside and inside Africa had a more recent eastern Africa origin. Both western and eastern M1 lineages participated in the Neolithic colonization of the Sahara. The striking parallelism between subclade ages and geographic distribution of M1 and its North African U6 counterpart strongly reinforces this scenario. Finally, a relevant fraction of M1a lineages present today in the European Continent and nearby islands possibly had a Jewish instead of the commonly proposed Arab/Berber maternal ascendance. Dispersal A number of studies have proposed that the ancestors of modern haplogroup M dispersed from Africa through the southern route across the Horn of Africa along the coastal regions of Asia onwards to New Guinea and Australia. These studies suggested that the migrations of haplogroups M and N occurred separately with haplogroup N heading northwards from East Africa to the Levant. However, the results of numerous recent studies indicate that there was only one migration out of Africa and that haplogroups M and N were part of the same migration. This is based on the analysis of a number of relict populations along the proposed beachcombing route from Africa to Australia, all of which possessed both haplogroups N and M.: \\"Haplogroup L3 (the African clade that gave rise to the two basal non-African clades, haplogroups M and N) is 84,000 years old, and haplogroups M and N themselves are almost identical in age at 63,000 years old, with haplogroup R diverging rapidly within haplogroup N 60,000 years ago.\\" A 2008 study by Abu-Amero et al., suggests that the Arabian Peninsula may have been the main route out of Africa. However, as the region lacks of autochthonous clades of haplogroups M and N the authors suggest that the area has been a more recent receptor of human migrations than an ancient demographic expansion center along the southern coastal route as proposed under the single migration Out-of-Africa scenario of the African origin hypothesis. Distribution M is the most common mtDNA haplogroup in Asia, super-haplogroup M is distributed all over Asia, where it represents 60% of all maternal lineages. All Andamanese subgroups of M which is unique to Andamanese people. It peaks in the Malaysian aboriginal Negrito tribes of Semang; 84% in Mendriq people, Batek people 48%, (almost all belong to the specific Malaysian Negrito haplogroup M21a also found in Orang Asli 21%, Thais 7.8% and Malay 4.6% ) The 200,000-Year Evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens Language and Myth Families based on the mtDNA Phylotree, Fossil mtDNA and Archaeology: A Thought Experiment (2014) It also peaks very high in Japan and Tibet, where it represents on average about 70% of the maternal lineages (160/216 = 74% Tibet, 205/282 = 73% T≈çkai, 231/326 = 71% Okinawa, 148/211 = 70% Japanese, 50/72 = 69% Tibet, 150/217 = 69% Hokkaid≈ç, 24/35 = 69% Zhongdian Tibetan, 175/256 = 68% northern Ky≈´sh≈´, 38/56 = 68% Qinghai Tibetan, 16/24 = 67% Diqing Tibetan, 66/100 = 66% Miyazaki, 33/51 = 65% Ainu, 214/336 = 64% T≈çhoku, 75/118 = 64% Tokyo (JPT)) and is ubiquitous in India and South Korea, where it has approximately 60% frequency. Among Chinese people both inside and outside of China, haplogroup M accounts for approximately 50% of all mtDNA on average, but the frequency varies from approximately 40% in Hans from Hunan and Fujian in southern China to approximately 60% in Shenyang, Liaoning in northeastern China. Haplogroup M accounts for approximately 42% of all mtDNA in Filipinos, among whom it is represented mainly by M7c3c and E. In Vietnam, haplogroup M has been found in 37% (52/139) to 48% (20/42) of samples of Vietnamese and in 32% (54/168) of a sample of Chams from B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province. Haplogroup M accounts for 43% (92/214) of all mtDNA in a sample of Laotians, with its subclade M7 (M7b, M7c, and M7e) alone accounting for a full third of all haplogroup M, or 14.5% (31/214) of the total sample. In Oceania, A 2008 study found Haplogroup M in 42% (60/144) of a pool of samples from nine language groups in the Admiralty Islands of Papua New Guinea., M has been found in 35% (17/48) of a sample of Papua New Guinea highlanders from the Bundi area and in 28% (9/32) of a sample of Aboriginal Australians from Kalumburu in northwestern Australia. In a study published in 2015, Haplogroup M was found in 21% (18/86) of a sample of Fijians, but it was not observed in a sample of 21 Rotumans. Haplogroup M is also relatively common in Northeast Africa, occurring especially among Somalis, Libyans and Oromos at frequencies over 20%. Toward the northwest, the lineage is found at comparable frequencies among the Tuareg in Mali and Burkina Faso; particularly the M1a2 subclade (18.42%). Among the descendant lineages of haplogroup M are C, D, E, G, Q, and Z. Z and G are found in North Eurasian populations, C and D exists among North Eurasian and Native American populations, E is observed in Southeast Asian populations, and Q is common among Melanesian populations. The lineages M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M18 and M25 are exclusive to South Asia, with M2 reported to be the oldest lineage on the Indian sub-continent. In 2013, four ancient specimens dated to around 2,500 BC-500 AD, which were excavated from the Tell Ashara (Terqa) and Tell Masaikh (Kar-Assurnasirpal) archaeological sites in the Euphrates Valley, were found to belong to mtDNA haplotypes associated with the M4b1, M49 and/or M61 haplogroups. Since these clades are not found among the current inhabitants of the area, they are believed to have been brought at a more remote period from east of Mesopotamia; possibly by either merchants or the founders of the ancient Terqa population. In 2016, three Late Pleistocene European hunter-gatherers were also found to carry M lineages. Two of the specimens were from the Goyet archaeological site in Belgium and were dated to 34,000 and 35,000 years ago, respectively. The other ancient individual hailed from the La Rochette site in France, and was dated to 28,000 years ago. Ancient DNA analysis of Iberomaurusian skeletal remains at the Taforalt site in Morocco, which have been dated to between 15,100 and 13,900 ybp, observed the M1b subclade in one of the fossils (1/7; ~14%). Ancient individuals belonging to the Late Iron Age settlement of √áemialo Sƒ±rtƒ± in Batman, southeast Turkey were found to carry haplogroup M; specifically the M1a1 subclade (1/12; ~8.3%). Haplogroup M was also detected in ancient specimens from Southeast Anatolia (0.4%). Additionally, M1 has been observed among ancient Egyptian mummies excavated at the Abusir el-Meleq archaeological site in Middle Egypt, which date from the Pre-Ptolemaic/late New Kingdom and Roman periods. Fossils at the Early Neolithic site of Ifri n'Amr or Moussa in Morocco, which have been dated to around 5,000 BCE, have also been found to carry the M1b subclade. These ancient individuals bore an autochthonous Maghrebi genomic component that peaks among modern Berbers, indicating that they were ancestral to populations in the area. The ancient Egyptian aristocrats Nakht-Ankh and Khnum-Nakht were also found to belong to the M1a1 subclade. The half-brothers lived during the 12th Dynasty, with their tomb located at the Deir Rifeh cemetery in Middle Egypt.

He is the first prime minister to date that never became ruler or even crown prince. Early life Sheikh Nasser was born on 22 December 1940 as the son of Mohammed Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the first defense minister of Kuwait. He is the nephew of the former Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. He attended high school in the United Kingdom and graduated in 1955. Then, he received a higher diploma in the French language in 1960. From 1960 to 1964, courses in Political Science and Economics from the University of Geneva in Switzerland. Career Sheikh Nasser began his career as a third secretary at the foreign ministry in 1964. He became a member of the permanent Kuwaiti delegation at the United Nations in New York in October 1964. He then served as ambassador to Iran and Afghanistan, the minister of information, minister of social affairs and labour, minister of state for foreign affairs and minister of the Emiri Diwan. He became prime minister when Sabah Al Ahmad began to rule Kuwait in February 2006. Sheikh Nasser resigned on 4 March 2007 in a move observers believe was aimed at avoiding a no-confidence motion against health minister Sheikh Ahmad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah. Ten MPs presented the motion in February over suspected financial and administrative breaches at the ministry. The vote was due to have taken place in parliament on 5 March and Sheikh Ahmad would have had to step down if legislators had voted against him. He was reappointed as prime minister on 6 March. On 25 November, the cabinet resigned, and on 17 December the Emir reappointed Nasser as prime minister of the new cabinet.Kuwait re- appoints prime minister BBC In March 2009, the Kuwaiti Government submitted its resignation to the Emir of Kuwait after Islamist MPs requested a hearing of the P.M. On 9 May, after the election of the new Parliament, the Emir asked Sheikh Nasser to form the Kuwaiti Government for the sixth consecutive time. The new Government maintained supremacy of the Al-Ahmed Branch of the Al-Sabah Family. Nasser with U.S. President George W. Bush in 2008 In January 2011, he survived a vote of no-confidence in parliament with a vote of 25‚Äì25 (26 were needed to bring down the Government). In April 2011, his cabinet resigned due to a stand-off with parliament; he was reappointed on 6 April 2011 to form a new government, but he resigned again on 28 November 2011. His resignation was accepted by the Emir and who appointed Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah as next prime minister on 4 December 2011. Dispute with Speaker Al-Kharafi On 3 November 2007, Parliamentary Speaker Jassem Al-Kharafi told the pan-Arab Arabiya television in an interview that he had \\"question marks\\" about the Prime Minister's decisions. A transcript of the interview was published in Alrai daily, which included Al-Kharafi's comment that too many reshuffles necessitate \\"a review and an evaluation of what measures should be taken.\\" Al- Kharafi said the reshuffle should not have been put off for the whole summer and that it indicated a \\"policy of patching\\" up problems, rather than solving them. In response, Prime Minister Nasser issued a statement about Al-Kharafi to the state-owned Kuwait News Agency, which was splashed on the front pages of daily newspapers. In the statement, PM Nasser said that Al-Kharafi was overstepping in bounds in trying to influence cabinet selections: \\"I have no doubt that .... the speaker realizes that his attempts to interfere in forming the Cabinet and affecting its decisions is overstretching his constitutional mandate.\\" The back-and-forth marked the first such public tensions between a speaker and a prime minister.Parliament speaker and prime minister bicker publicly Personal life He married Sheikha Shahrazad Al-Humoud Al-Jaber Al- Sabah, with whom he had: Sabah and Ahmad.  Controversies = Dispute with Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah and corruption allegations  In March 2011, MPs aligned with Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed (Marzouq Al-Ghanim and Adel Al- Saraawi) in Kuwait's National Assembly threatened to grill Sheikh Ahmad Al- Fahad, then deputy prime minister, over misconduct in government contracts, leading to Sheikh Ahmad's resignation from government in June 2011. = Alleged Payments to MPs = In August 2011, supporters of Sheikh Ahmad Al- Fahad \\"discovered\\" documents that incriminated up to one-third of MPs in what quickly became the largest political corruption scandal in Kuwaiti history. By October 2011, 16 MPs were alleged to have received payments of $350m in return for their support of government policy. = Alleged Payments through Ministry of Foreign Affairs = Also in October 2011, rabble-rousing MP Musallam Al- Barrack, a close associate of Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad, alleged that millions of Kuwaiti dinars had been transferred through Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the overseas bank accounts of the prime minister, Sheikh Nasser Al- Mohammed. This led to respected Foreign Minister Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al-Sabah, the only remaining member of the Al-Salem branch of the Sabah family, to resign in protest. Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed denied the allegations, saying that \\"all the transfers were in the service of the interests of Kuwait and contained no personal benefit\\" and was subsequently acquitted by a special judicial tribunal in Kuwait. = Public Protests and Resignation = Mass political rallies held in November 2011 led the Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al- Sabah to reluctantly accept Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed's resignation on 28 November 2011. = 'Fake' Coup Video = In December 2013, allies of Ahmad Al-Fahad claimed to posses tapes purportedly showing that Nasser Al-Mohammed and former Parliament Speaker Jassem Al-Kharafi were discussing plans to topple the Kuwaiti government. In April 2014 the Kuwaiti government imposed a total media blackout to ban any reporting or discussion on the issue. In March 2015, Kuwait's public prosecutor dropped all investigations into the alleged coup plot and Ahmad Al-Fahad read a public apology on Kuwait state television renouncing the coup allegations. Since then, \\"numerous associates of his have been targeted and detained by the Kuwaiti authorities on various charges,\\" most notably members of the so-called \\"Fintas Group\\" that had allegedly been the original circulators of the 'fake' coup video.

Biography B.A. Syracuse University, 1960, American Studies; M.A. Columbia University, 1961, Public Law and Government; Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, 1965, Political Science. He is currently Emeritus Maxwell Upson Professor of Government and Adjunct Professor of Law at Cornell University. Thought Tarrow's first area of interest was the study of communism in the 1960s. In the 1970s he moved to the study of comparative local politics and in the 1980s to the study of social movements and protest cycles (or 'cycles of contention'). A specialist in European politics and society, Sidney Tarrow has written widely on Italian and French politics, centre-periphery relations, new social movements, and contentious politics. Tarrow is a leading expert on new social movements and, more broadly, the phenomena of contentious behaviour. His 1994 book Power in Movement analyses the cultural, organizational and personal sources of social movements' power, stressing that the life cycle of social movements is a part of political struggle influenced by the existence (or lack of) the political opportunity structures. He argues that social movements rise \\"when shifting political conditions open opportunities for disruption and the activities of social movements in turn can alter political policies and structures\\". Tarrow's five elements of political opportunity structures includes: 1) increasing access, 2) shifting alignments, 3) divided elites, 4) influential allies and 5) repression and facilitation. Tarrow writes that unlike political or economic social institutions, social movements' power is less obvious, but just as real. In the book, Tarrow tries to explain the cyclical history of social movements (visible in the form of the protest cycles). He also shows how movements can affect various spheres of life, such as personal lives, policy reforms and political culture. In that book he also lists four prerequisites of sustainable social movements: 1) political opportunities, 2) diffuse social networks, 3) familiar forms of collective action (also known as the Charles Tilly's repertoire of contention), and 4) cultural frames that can resonate throughout a population. In 2001, Tarrow, with Doug McAdam and Charles Tilly, published Dynamics of Contention (Cambridge 2001), in which the authors broadened the social movement framework to cover a broader spectrum of forms of contention. This was followed by Tarrow's New Transnational Activism (Cambridge 2005), in which he applied the framework to the new transnational cycle of contention, and by a textbook with Tilly called Contentious Politics (Paradigm, 2006). He is currently working on international human rights. He was formerly on the advisory board of FFIPP-USA (Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace-USA), a network of Palestinian, Israeli, and International faculty, and students, working in for an end of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and just peace.

Albums were subsequently released under the MFP label in Australia (MFP-A) and South Africa. MFP was set up in 1965 as a joint venture between EMI, which provided the source material, and the publisher Paul Hamlyn, which handled distribution in so-called non-traditional outlets, such as W.H. Smith, the booksellers. The MFP catalogue consisted of both original material and reissues of existing EMI recordings, including records by \\"name\\" artists such as Kenny Rogers, the Beach Boys, Blondie, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, the Animals and the Beatles. Original material included studio recordings of successful West End musicals, the first of which were recorded secretly for EMI by the young independent producer David Gooch (later producing Alma Cogan and Vera Lynn) who was given carte blanche to select three productions: these were South Pacific, Carousel and The Sound of Music, the last of which sold 250,000 copies. These albums were also manufactured for the Regal label in Canada. Some years later, they were re-recorded by Norman Newell. During the late-1980s and early-1990s, MFP became the major budget priced label in the UK, the label being run by Alec Sharman. Other notable sub-labels which were part of MFP included Classics for Pleasure (CFP) managed by Patricia Byrne, Listen for Pleasure (LFP) managed by Roger Godbald, a spoken word label and 'Fame' managed by Peter O'Cain which re-issued classic rock and pop albums from Queen, Paul McCartney, Marillion, and other successful EMI artists. All the labels moved from vinyl to cassette and finally to CDs, but when the CD market slowed in the mid-1990s MFP struggled to maintain sales in line with what was expected by the owner company EMI Records, so in 1995 the management team which had been led so successfully by Roger Woodhead was re-structured and Music For Pleasure became a sub label of the newly launched EMI Gold headed up by Paul Holland. The label continued with some measure of success with releases from classic artists such as Shirley Bassey, Nat King Cole, Cliff Richard, Dean Martin and even Classic Sing-A-Long Party CDs. In 1999 when Paul Holland left to join Granada, Steve Woof took over the running of the label. The affiliated label Disky from the Netherlands was also licensed to re-release various EMI and King Biscuit Flower Hour releases in Europe. The Fame label reissued several Beatles, Pink Floyd and related albums in the 1980s. The MFP label was briefly revived by EMI as a budget reissue label in the UK. One release was of Frank Sinatra. The subsequent sale of EMI to several competitors quietly ended MFP by 2012. Public perception Similar in business model to the American Pickwick Records it would often attract attention due to the soundalike records it produced. Notable releases * The Pink Floyd compilation Relics was reissued on the MFP label as MFP 50397. It originally appeared on sister budget label Starline in the UK. * Adamo compilation The Number One Continental Singer printed in 1967 UK - MFP label as MFP 1332. * Kenny Rogers's second solo album was issued on MFP in the late 1980s, after the United Artists/Liberty labels deleted a lot of their albums. This was one of the few albums from that label to remain in print. * Roger Whitaker released a record of children's songs titled The Magical World of Roger Whitaker that contained his well-known version of \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\". * The Beatles compilation double album, Rock 'n' Roll Music, was reissued on the Music for Pleasure label in 1980 as two separate single albums (MFP 50506 and MFP 50507). The live album The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl was reissued on MFP in 1984. * Several solo Beatles albums were issued on MFP: John Lennon's Mind Games and Rock 'n' Roll; George Harrison's Dark Horse and The Best of George Harrison, and Ringo Starr's Ringo and Blast from Your Past. * The Beach Boys album Pet Sounds was released on MFP in Australia as The Fabulous Beach Boys (MFP A8090). Smiley Smile was also released as The Beach Boys or Good Vibrations (MFP A8138) the following year. * In 1971, MFP issued compilations of the work of producer Mickie Most including The Most of The Animals (MFP 5218) and The Most of Herman's Hermits (MFP 5216). Both of these albums reached the top 20, the Herman's Hermits album becoming their highest charting album in the UK. * The 1972 MFP compilation Spirit Of Rock: The Probe Sampler contained licensed recordings from the Probe label, notably including the song \\"Dallas\\" by Steely Dan, which never appeared on an album or compilation. It was only otherwise available as a promo single at the time and years later on the EP Plus Fours. The cover of Spirit Of Rock claims that the song is taken from their first album Can't Buy A Thrill, but it was ultimately not included by the time the album came out later that year. The included version of Dallas is a fake stereo version made from the mono single version, and this mix remains exclusive to the compilation to this day. * In 1973 Telltale released a full version of their intro song from Thames Television's Rainbow * In parallel with the Top of the Pops albums issued by Pickwick, MFP issued a series of LPs in the early 1970s containing anonymous cover versions of current hits. Called Hot Hits, the series ran to 20 before folding. They were eligible for listing in the UK LP charts for a few months in 1971, and four charted: Volume 5 registered for a solitary week at number 48 as sales were dwindling; Volume 6 topped the album charts for a week in August, and volumes 7 and 8 peaked at 3 and 2 respectively. Thereafter the albums were disqualified again. MFP also issued a plethora of spin-offs based on the \\"hits\\" theme (e.g. \\"Smash Hits\\", \\"Hit Hits\\", \\"Soul Hits\\" MFP 1280, \\"Million Seller Hits\\" etc.) \\"Hot Hits 6\\" remains MFP's most successful release on chart, and their only number 1 album. One compilation which was of good quality is called Junior Hits. It contained songs by Jimmy Webb and Rolf Harris and sold well in 1970. * In 1980, MFP released the song \\"There's No One Quite Like Grandma\\" by the St Winifred's School Choir. * The label also claimed a first by releasing Sinatra Sings Music For Pleasure featuring tracks from Frank Sinatra's Capitol albums.

Early career Grey, the great-grandson of 1st Earl Grey, was educated at Durham School and Brasenose College, Oxford. In 1881 he joined The Inniskillings (6th Dragoons) and saw service in the Anglo-Zulu War. When the war ended he was in command of the Bechuanaland Border police, and in the Matabeleland rebellion of 1893 he commanded a column of the British army. From 1894 to 1897 his kinsman the 4th Earl Grey was Administrator of Rhodesia, and Grey accompanied Leander Starr Jameson on the Jameson Raid in 1895; in the aftermath of the raid, Grey served five months' imprisonment. Southern Rhodesia Colony When Southern Rhodesia was granted a part-elected Legislative Council, Grey was elected at the first election in 1899 to represent Mashonaland. It was subsequently discovered that his supporters had committed bribery and treating of potential voters, and Grey resigned in order to be re-elected free of the taint of electoral corruption. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, Grey volunteered for active duty as a special service officer, and left Southampton in the SS Moor in March 1900, arriving in Cape Town the next month. He was promoted to major in March 1901 \\"for command of mounted troops on the occasion of the capture of Boer guns by Major-General Babington's column\\". After the war he retired from the Army in 1904, but remained Commandant of the local Volunteers. He established the company Rhodesia Lands, Ltd. to develop mining and farming interests: the 'Jumbo' mine owned by his company became one of the most profitable. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. Political development In the early 1920s the Southern Rhodesians decided to break away from the sponsorship of the British South Africa Company. The issue among the leading figures of the colony was whether to obtain their own 'Responsible Government' or to seek membership of the Union of South Africa. Grey strongly believed that joining South Africa would be preferable, and argued forcibly for it in the Legislative Council. However the majority there and among the public was against him, and as a result he lost his seat in the 1920 election. Later life Grey took this repudiation in good heart but did not participate in politics again, turning his attention to his business interests. In the late 1920s he returned to Britain, and died in a nursing home in London in 1936.

His father was listed as a Stonemason. Aviation career In 1905, Folland became an apprentice at the Lanchester Motor Company in Birmingham, he then joined the design staff at Swift Motor Company and then in 1908 he became a draughtsman at the Daimler Company. It was at Daimler that he developed his interest in powered flying machines.James 2007, p. 11.

Nieuport & General ceased operations in 1920 Flight 19 August 1920. and his services were taken up by the Gloster Aircraft Company, who had built Nighthawks under licence during the First World War, joining them in 1921.James 1971, pp. 7‚Äì9. Folland was the chief designer for Gloster for many years, producing a range of successful fighter aircraft such as the Grebe, Gamecock, Gauntlet and finally the Gloster Gladiator. Folland Aircraft Ltd. Folland left the company in 1937, following the takeover of Gloster by Hawker, feeling that Hawker designs would be favoured over his own. Folland purchased the British Marine Aircraft Company at Hamble, near Southampton, renaming it Folland Aircraft Limited.James 1971, p. 38. Initially, Folland Aircraft was mainly involved in sub-contract work for other aircraft manufacturers particularly during the Second World War. Some 45 civil and military projects were offered by Follands to meet Air Ministry requirements. Only one - the Fo.108 - a flying engine testbed nicknamed the \\"Frightful\\" from its appearance, was accepted and 12 of these were built.James 2007, p. 157.

Background Manicio was born on March 25, 1925 in Sabang, Dasmari√±as, Cavite. Leonardo's baptism as an infant have Jose Barzaga as godfather or padrino/ninong who belong to a wealthy clan who's scions were prominent lawyers, land owners and politicians in the town, His father Juan Manicio was a farmer and politician of some consequence in his town and enjoyed long time affliation centered on the prominent Carungcong, Mangubat, Barzaga intermarried family group, Due to his father's alliance with the Barzaga's his father Juan Manicio became a target and was killed and robbed of their livestock in their home in 1944 by his political rivals who belong to a cattle rustlers and an armed guerilla group under Col. Emiliano De La Cruz from barrio Paliparan, Dasmarinas (14th Infantry Unit) who is vying for control over the turf in Dasmarinas, these armed band that murdered Manicio's father competed with a rival armed guerilla unit under Col. Estanislao Mangubat Carungcong (4th Infantry Regiment), in these circumstances Putik seeking revenge for the injustice his family have suffered at the hands of the cattle rustlers and in need of support to have justice for his father, was drawn into factional politics in Dasmarinas and was soon appointed as a police officer in Dasmari√±as by then Mayor Felicisimo Carungcong in 1944 and enlisted as a fully armed retainer of the powerful clique of families in Dasmarinas the Carungcong, Mangubat and Barzaga family group and sometime with the father and son tandem of Senator Justiniano and Governor Delfin Montano of Amaya, Tanza Cavite and lastly with Governor Lino Bocalan and Vice Governor Dominador CamerinoThe Philippine Free Press, \\"Nardong Putik Captured\\" by Filemon V. Tutay, May 31, 1958. According to Cavite√±os, Manicio got that name as he was known to submerge himself in mud paddies, among carabaos, using bamboo or papaya stalks as breathing tubes, whenever he had to evade a police or military dragnet. Putik was married to Feliciana but had many common-law wives. He had one known son, Leonardo, Jr. and two known daughters, Angelita and Estrellita with his legal wife. Criminal career Philippine Constabulary files show Manicio was involved in various criminal cases which ranged from illegal possession of firearms to kidnapping, armed robbery and murder starting from 1948. Among the major cases in which Manicio was involved in were the infamous Maragondon Massacre in 1952 where the mayor, police chief and several policemen were killed with hunting knives, and the 1957 Election Day killing of Lt. Colonel Laureano Mara√±a, then provincial commander of Cavite, and seven others. Cavite politicians were also found to have been in league with the Manicio, utilizing him in their struggle for political supremacy. Manicio led a group of roving bandits engaged in kidnapping, robbery, car theft, murder, marijuana growing, protection, and murder-for-hire as a gunman for Cavite's politicians. First capture Manicio was first convicted and jailed in 1953 but escaped in July 1955 from the Constabulary stockade in Imus, Cavite where he was held as a detention prisoner and were reporting to then Governor Dominador I Mangubat. On Election Day of 1957, an encounter was occurred between his group and the group led by then Cavite Philippine Constabulary (PC) commander Lt. Col. Laureano Marana, wherein Marana and his men were killed. Second capture Manicio was re- captured on May 27, 1958 after he was cornered in a rice mill in barrio Medicion in Imus, Cavite by Lt. Elias R. Lazo, Jr. of the 31st PC Company and Lt. Federico D. Navarro of the 117th PC Company who were both promoted to Captain and decorated the Gold Cross Medal, the third highest military battle award, for their daring capture. Manicio surrendered to Lt. Lazo after engaging the patrol in a 45-minute gun battle.The Manila Times, \\"Putik Captor Promoted\\", June 20, 1958The Manila Times, \\"Thug's Captor Get Award\\", August 5, 1958The Manila Times, \\"Putik held at Crame\\" By David Baquirin, 1958 Manicio credited his survival to his anting-anting. Manicio was sentenced to jail for 182 years and two months at the national penitentiary in Muntinlupa, but was granted freedom of movement. He escaped in October 1969 and took refuge from his home town who he still have close ties with his long time mentor Mayor Remigio Carungcong. Massacre of NBI agents  In the morning of February 10, 1971, two agents of the Narcotics Division of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Rogelio Domingo and Antonio Dayao, were killed by Putik and his men. Victims belonged to a group headed by Supervising Agent Eligio Songco, that went to Imus, Cavite to survey and raid a marijuana plantation allegedly being protected by Putik. Some of his men involved were later apprehended, charged and convicted in court in connection to the killings.See Supreme Court decision \\"G.R. No. L-36613-14\\" dated July 24, 1981. Link retrieved May 20, 2019. Death A joint NBI-Constabulary force was assembled with the intention was to capture Manicio, dead or alive, who by then had a PHP20,000 bounty on his head by the new acting governor, Juanito \\"Johnny\\" Remulla. Reportedly, Lt. Col. Miguel Gantuangco, one of the task forces' commanding officers with NBI Agent Epimaco Velasco, attempted to coax Manicio into surrendering via Bishop Vicedo of Caloocan, but the attempts proved fruitless. On October 9‚Äì10, 1972, the task force attempted to follow him, discovering his hideout by the 10th. Ambushes were prepared by the Constabulary in the general area in the early morning hours along the possible routes he would take. On October 11, 1971, Manicio's red Chevrolet Impala came upon a task force highway checkpoint between Panamitan and Kawit. Manicio refused to obey the signals for him to stop, and the 20 assembled agents and police officers opened fire, killing him almost instantly. On his person was a revolver, 300 pesos, $150 in counterfeit bills, a wallet, a notebook with information regarding his debts, and several false identity papers.http://junbriosolawandbehold.blogspot.com/2014/08/nardong-putik.html The operation later boosted the careers of Remulla and Velasco, As the Montano's were on self exile to America, Lino Bocalan in jail, the death of Camerino and the death of the \\"Kilabot\\" Nardong Putik, The former would later become a Constitutional Delegate; Velasco the head of the NBI, later DILG secretary and Cavite governor, and so it was to Johnny Remulla who have now a clear path to become new Cavite Governor. On Manicio's death, some of his men were later arrested, charged and convicted in court for murder and other offenses. The killing was also met with mixed reactions in Cavite as he had built a reputation as a local \\"Robin Hood\\" given that his criminal exploits mainly targeted the rich. =Alternate theories regarding his death= An alternate theory regarding Manicio's death later surfaced, supported by some of Manicio's friends, an acquaintance in the press, and a former police chief. This version claimed that Manicio was lured to a resort, drugged, and placed in the Impala, whereupon his pursuers opened fire at the car to give the illusion he had been gunned down while resisting arrest. Another legend of his true demise, according to Cavite√±o legends, Nardo was invited by one of his friend (kumpare) into a social gathering that was sponsored and paid generously by a Cavite political leader. When Putik appeared to be tipsy (a condition which is prohibited for an individual who possesses an amulet due to its ability to lose its effect when the holder was intoxicated by alcohol), he was then hit on the back of his head by his friend and died from the injury. The body was surrendered to the NBI and PC for the aforementioned staging of his \\"death\\". In popular culture Two versions of Nardong Putik (Kilabot ng Cavite) were made in 1972 and in 1984, wherein in both films, Manicio was portrayed by action star and then-future politician Ramon Revilla, Sr. Both were a success at the local box office, and Revilla later played a double role as Manicio and his supposed rival and fellow Cavite-based career criminal, Captain Eddie Set in 1974's Kapitan Eddie Set: Mad Killer of Cavite. The films capitalized on the supposed incredible magic of Manicio's anting-anting. Both were loosely based on his life while portrayed him as an anti-hero.

The organisation arose from a conglomeration of local youth groups and gyms (akhara) in Bengal in 1902. It had two prominent, somewhat independent, arms in East and West Bengal, Dhaka Anushilan Samiti (centred in Dhaka, modern day Bangladesh), and the Jugantar group (centred at Calcutta). From its foundation to its dissolution during the 1930s, the Samiti challenged British rule in India by engaging in militant nationalism, including bombings, assassinations, and politically-motivated violence. The Samiti collaborated with other revolutionary organisations in India and abroad. It was led by the nationalists Aurobindo Ghosh and his brother Barindra Ghosh, and influenced by philosophies as diverse as Hindu Shakta philosophy, as set forth by Bengali authors Bankim and Vivekananda, Italian Nationalism, and the Pan-Asianism of Kakuzo Okakura. The Samiti was involved in a number of noted incidents of revolutionary attacks against British interests and administration in India, including early attempts to assassinate British Raj officials. These were followed by the 1912 attempt on the life of the Viceroy of India, and the Seditious conspiracy during World War I, led by Rash Behari Bose and Jatindranath Mukherjee respectively. The organisation moved away from its philosophy of violence in the 1920s due to the influence of the Indian National Congress and the Gandhian non-violent movement. A section of the group, notably those associated with Sachindranath Sanyal, remained active in the revolutionary movement, founding the Hindustan Republican Association in north India. A number of Congress leaders from Bengal, especially Subhash Chandra Bose, were accused by the British Government of having links with the organisation during this time. The Samiti's violent and radical philosophy revived in the 1930s, when it was involved in the Kakori conspiracy, the Chittagong armoury raid, and other actions against the administration in British-occupied India. Shortly after its inception, the organisation became the focus of an extensive police and intelligence operation which led to the founding of the Special branch of the Calcutta Police. Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against the Samiti at various times included Sir Robert Nathan, Sir Harold Stuart, Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore and Sir Charles Tegart. The threat posed by the activities of the Samiti in Bengal during World War I, along with the threat of a Ghadarite uprising in Punjab, led to the passage of Defence of India Act 1915. These measures enabled the arrest, internment, transportation and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, which crushed the East Bengal Branch. In the aftermath of the war, the Rowlatt committee recommended extending the Defence of India Act (as the Rowlatt Act) to thwart any possible revival of the Samiti in Bengal and the Ghadarite movement in Punjab. After the war, the activities of the party led to the implementation of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment in the early 1920s, which reinstated the powers of incarceration and detention from the Defence of India Act. However, the Anushilan Samiti gradually disseminated into the Gandhian movement. Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress then led by Subhas Chandra Bose, while others identified more closely with Communism. The Jugantar branch formally dissolved in 1938. In independent India, the party in West Bengal evolved into the Revolutionary Socialist Party, while the Eastern Branch later evolved into the Shramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal (Workers and Peasants Socialist Party) in present-day Bangladesh. Background The growth of the Indian middle class during the 19th century led to a growing sense of Indian identity that fed a rising tide of nationalism in India in the last decades of the 1800s. The creation of the Indian National Congress in 1885 by A.O. Hume provided a major platform for the demands of political liberalisation, increased autonomy and social reform. The nationalist movement became particularly strong, radical and violent in Bengal and, later, in Punjab. Notable, if smaller, movements also appeared in Maharashtra, Madras and other areas in the South. The movement in Maharashtra, especially Mumbai (formerly Bombay) and Poona, preceded most revolutionary movements in the country. This movement was supported ideologically by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who may also have offered covert active support. The Indian Association was founded in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) in 1876 under the leadership of Surendranath Banerjea. The Association became the mouthpiece of an informal constituency of students and middle-class gentlemen. It sponsored the Indian National Conference in 1883 and 1885, which later merged with the Indian National Congress. Kolkata - formerly Calcutta was at the time the most prominent centre for organised politics, and some of the students who attended the political meetings began to organise \\"secret societies\\" that cultivated a culture of physical strength and nationalist feelings. Timeline=Origins By 1902, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) had three secret societies working toward the violent overthrow of British rule in India: one founded by Calcutta student Satish Chandra Basu with the patronage of Calcutta barrister Pramatha Mitra, another led by Sarala Devi, and the third founded by Aurobindo Ghose. Ghose and his brother Barin were among the strongest proponents of militant Indian nationalism at the time. The militant nationalists thought of more direct and violent ways of ending British rule in India ... The chief apostle of militant nationalism in Bengal was Aurobindo Ghose. In 1902, there were three secret societies in Calcutta - Anushilan Samiti, founded by Pramatha Mitra, a barrister of the High Court of Calcutta; a society sponsored by Aurobindo Ghose and a society started by Sarala Devi ... the government found it difficult to suppress revolutionary activities in Bengal owing to ... leaders like Jatindranath Mukherjee, Rashbehari Bose and Jadugopal Mukherjee. Nationalist writings and publications by Aurobindo and Barin, including Bande Mataram and Jugantar Patrika(Yugantar), had a widespread influence on Bengal youth and helped Anushilan Samiti to gain popularity in Bengal. The 1905 partition of Bengal stimulated radical nationalist sentiments in Bengal's Bhadralok community, helping the Samiti to acquire the support of educated, politically-conscious and disaffected members of local youth societies. The Samiti's program emphasized physical training, training its recruits with daggers and lathis (bamboo staffs used as weapons). The Dhaka branch was led by Pulin Behari Das, and branches spread throughout East Bengal and Assam. More than 500 branches were opened in eastern Bengal and Assam, linked by \\"close and detailed organization\\" to Pulin's headquarters at Dhaka. This branch soon overshadowed its parent organisation in Calcutta. Branches of Dhaka Anushilan Samiti emerged in Jessore, Khulna, Faridpur, Rajnagar, Rajendrapur, Mohanpur, Barvali and Bakarganj, with an estimated membership of 15,000 to 20,000. Within two years, Dhaka Anushilan changed its aims from those of the Swadeshi movement to that of political terrorism. The organisation's political views were expressed in the journal Jugantar, founded in March 1906 by Abhinash Bhattacharya, Barindra, Bhupendranath Dutt and Debabrata Basu. It soon became an organ for the radical views of Aurobindo and other Anushilan leaders, and led to the Calcutta Samiti group being dubbed the \\"Jugantar party\\". Early leaders were Rash Behari Bose, Bhavabhushan Mitra, Jatindranath Mukherjee and Jadugopal Mukherjee. Aurobindo published similar messages of violent nationalism in journals such as Sandhya, Navashakti and Bande Mataram. Nationalism and violence The Dhaka Anushilan Samiti broke with the Jugantar group in West Bengal due to disagreements with Aurobindo's approach of slowly building a mass base for revolution. The Dhaka group instead sought immediate action and results through political terrorism. The two branches of the Samiti engaged in dacoity to raise money, and performed a number of political assassinations. The first such dacoity was committed by Naren ... Around this time, revolutionaries threw a bomb at the carriage of Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy ... in Muzaffarpur, under the mistaken notion that the 'notorious' Magistrate Kingsford was in the carriage. This led to the arrest of Kshudiram Bose and the discovery of the underground conspiratorial centre at Manicktala in eastern Calcutta ... Nandalal Banerjee, an officer in the Intelligence Branch of the Bengal Police was shot dead by Naren ... This was followed by the arrest of Aurobindo, Barin and others. In December 1907, the Bengal branch derailed a train carrying Bengal Lieutenant Governor Andrew Henderson Leith Fraser in a plot led by the Ghosh brothers. In the same month, the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti assassinated former Dhaka district magistrate D. C. Allen. The following year, the Samiti engineered eleven assassinations, seven attempted assassinations and explosions and eight dacoities in West Bengal. Their targets included British police officials and civil servants, Indian police officers, informants, public prosecutors of political crimes, and wealthy families. Under Barin Ghosh's direction, the Samiti's members also attempted to assassinate French colonial officials in Chandernagore who were seen as complicit with the Raj. Anushilan Samiti established early links with foreign movements and Indian nationalists abroad. In 1907, Barin Ghosh sent Hem Chandra Kanungo (Hem Chandra Das) to Paris to learn bomb-making from Nicholas Safranski, a Russian revolutionary in exile. Madam Cama, a leading figure of the Paris Indian Society and India House, a revolutionary organisation in London, also lived in Paris and was associated with V.D. Savarkar, who later published a bomb-making manual through India House. In 1908, young recruits Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki were sent on a mission to Muzaffarpur to assassinate chief presidency magistrate D. H. Kingsford. They bombed a carriage they mistook for Kingsford's, killing two Englishwomen. Bose was arrested while attempting to flee and Chaki committed suicide. Police investigation of the killers connected them with Barin's country house in Manicktala (a suburb of Calcutta) and led to a number of arrests, including Aurobindo and Barin. The ensuing trial, held under tight security, led to a death sentence for Barin (later commuted to life imprisonment). The case against Aurobindo Ghosh collapsed after Naren Gosain, who had turned crown witness, was shot in Alipore jail by Satyendranath Basu and Kanailal Dutta, who were also being tried. Aurobindo retired from active politics after being acquitted. This was followed by a 1909 Dhaka conspiracy case, which brought 44 members of the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti to trial. Nandalal Bannerjee (the officer who arrested Khudiram) was shot and killed in 1908, followed by the assassinations of the prosecutor and informant for the Alipore case in 1909. After Aurobindo's retirement, the western Anushilan Samiti found a more prominent leader in Bagha Jatin and emerged as the Jugantar. Jatin revitalised links between the central organisation in Calcutta and its branches in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh, establishing hideouts in the Sunderbans for members who had gone underground.M. N. Roy's Memoirs p3 The group slowly reorganised, aided by Amarendra Chatterjee, Naren Bhattacharya and other younger leaders. Some of its younger members, including Taraknath Das, left India. Over the next two years, the organisation operated under the cover of two apparently-separate groups: Sramajeebi Samabaya (the Labourer's Cooperative) and S.D. Harry and Sons. Aurobihdo's retirement from active politics after his acquittal ... Two centres were established, one was the Sramajibi Samabaya ... and the other in the name of S.D. Harry and Sons. Around this time Jatin attempted to establish contacts with the 10th Jat Regiment, garrisoned at Fort William in Calcutta, and Narendra Nath committed a number of robberies to raise money. Shamsul Alam, a Bengal police officer preparing a conspiracy case against the group, was assassinated by Jatin associate Biren Dutta Gupta. His assassination led to the arrests which precipitated the Howrah-Sibpur Conspiracy case. Shamsul Alam, an Intelligence officer who was then preparing to arrest all the revolutionaries ... was murdered by Biren Datta Gupta, one of Jatin Mukherjee's associates. This led to the arrests in the Howrah Conspiracy case. In 1911, Dhaka Anushilan members shot dead Sub-inspector Raj Kumar and Inspector Man Mohan Ghosh, two Bengali police officers investigating unrest linked to the group, in Mymensingh and Barisal. This was followed by the assassination of CID head constable Shrish Chandra Dey in Calcutta. In February 1911, Jugantar bombed a car in Calcutta, mistaking an Englishman for police officer Godfrey Denham. Rash Behari Bose (described as \\"the most dangerous revolutionary in India\\") extended the group's reach into north India, where he found work in the Indian Forest Institute in Dehra Dun. Bose forged links with radical nationalists in Punjab and the United Provinces, including those later connected to Har Dayal. During the 1912 transfer of the imperial capital to New Delhi, Viceroy Charles Hardinge's howdah was bombed; his mahout was killed, and Lady Hardinge was injured. World War I Bagha Jatin, wounded after his final battle on the banks of Burha Balang off Balasore. As war between Germany and Britain began to seem likely, Indian nationalists at home and abroad decided to use the war for the nationalist cause. Through Kishen Singh, the Bengal Samiti cell was introduced to Har Dayal when Dayal visited India in 1908. The group foresaw the possibility of a world war and planned to launch a guerrilla war at that time, expecting assistance from Germany. ... Lala Hardayal, on his return to India in 1908, also became interested in the programme of the Bengal revolutionaries through Kissen Singh. Dayal was associated with India House, then headed by V. D. Savarkar. By 1910, Dayal was working closely with Rash Behari Bose. After the decline of India House, Dayal moved to San Francisco after working briefly with the Paris Indian Society. Nationalism among Indian immigrants (particularly students and the working class) was gaining ground in the United States. Taraknath Das, who left Bengal for the United States in 1907, was among the Indian students who engaged in political work. In California, Dayal became a leading organiser of Indian nationalism amongst predominantly-Punjabi immigrant workers and was a key member of the Ghadar Party. With Naren Bhattacharya, Jatin met the crown prince of Germany during the latter's 1912 visit to Calcutta and obtained an assurance that arms and ammunition would be supplied to them. Jatin learned about Bose's work from Niralamba Swami on a pilgrimage to Brindavan. Returning to Bengal, he began reorganising the group. Bose went into hiding in Benares after the 1912 attempt on Hardinge but he met Jatin towards the end of 1913, outlining prospects for a pan-Indian revolution. In 1914 Bose, the Maharashtrian Vishnu Ganesh Pingle and Sikh militants planned simultaneous troop uprisings for February 1915. In Bengal, Anushilan and Jugantar launched what has been described by historians as \\"a reign of terror in both the cities and the countryside ... [which] ... came close to achieving their key goal of paralysing the administration\\". An atmosphere of fear severely affected morale in both the police and courts. In August 1914, Jugantar seized a large amount of arms and ammunition from the Rodda company, a Calcutta arms dealer, and used them in robberies in Calcutta for the next two years. In 1915, only six revolutionaries were successfully tried. Both the February 1915 plot and a December 1915 plot were thwarted by British intelligence. Jatin and a number of fellow revolutionaries were killed in a firefight with police at Balasore, in present-day Orissa, which brought Jugantar to a temporary end. The Defence of India Act 1915 led to widespread arrests, internments, deportations and executions of members of the revolutionary movement. By March 1916, widespread arrests helped Bengal police crush the Dacca Anushilan Samiti in Calcutta. Regulation III and the Defence of India Act were enforced throughout Bengal in August 1916. By June 1917, 705 people were under house arrest under the Act and 99 were imprisoned under Regulation III. In Bengal, revolutionary violence fell to 10 incidents in 1917. According to official lists, 186 revolutionaries were killed or convicted by 1918. \\"Hemchandra Kanungo, to cite the earliest example, came back from Paris as an atheist with some interest in Marxism ... a street-beggar's lament for Kshudiram, for instance, could still be heard in Bengal decades after his execution ... In a 1918 official list of 186 killed or convicted revolutionaries, no less than 165 came from the three upper castes, Brahman, Kayastha, and Vaidya\\". After the war, the Defence of India Act was extended by the Rowlatt Act, the passage of which was a prime target of the protests of M. K. Gandhi's non-cooperation movement. Many revolutionaries released after the war escaped to Burma to avoid repeated incarceration. \\"Following ... the first two decades of the twentieth century, the Indian government's law enforcement officials had claimed that the detention of alleged Bengali terrorists was a success, a claim that served to justify the Rowlatt Report's recommendation of emergency measures in 1918. In response to this, many leaders of the revolutionary movement went underground in the 1920s and fled Bengal to other British territories, particularly Burma.\\" After the war The first non-cooperation movement, the Rowlatt Satyagrahas led by Gandhi, was active from 1919 to 1922. It received widespread support from prominent members of the Indian independence movement. In Bengal, Jugantar agreed to a request by Chittaranjan Das (a respected leader of the Indian National Congress) to refrain from violence. Although Anushilan Samiti did not adhere to the agreement, it sponsored no major actions between 1920 and 1922. During the next few years, Jugantar and the Samiti became active again. The resurgence of radical nationalism linked to the Samiti during the 1920s led to the passage of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance in 1924. The act restored extraordinary powers of detention to the police; by 1927 more than 200 suspects were imprisoned under the act, including Subhas Chandra Bose, curtailing the resurgence of nationalist violence in Bengal. Branches of Jugantar formed in Chittagong and Dhaka, in present-day Bangladesh. The Chittagong branch, led by Surya Sen, robbed the Chittagong office of the Assam-Bengal Railway in December 1923. In January 1924 a young Bengali, Gopi Mohan Saha, shot dead a European he mistook for Calcutta police commissioner Charles Tegart. The assassin was praised by the Bengali press and, to Gandhi's chagrin, proclaimed a martyr by the Bengal branch of the Congress. Around this time, Jugantar became closely associated with the Calcutta Corporation, headed by Das and Subhas Chandra Bose, and terrorists (and ex-terrorists) became significant factors in local Bengali government. In 1923 another group linked to Anushilan Samiti, the Hindustan Republican Association, was founded in Benares by Sachindranath Sanyal and Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, helping to radicalise north India. It soon had branches from Calcutta to Lahore. A series of successful dacoities in Uttar Pradesh were followed by a train robbery in Kakori, and subsequent investigations and two trials broke the organization. Several years later, it was reborn as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). In 1927, the Indian National Congress came out in favour of independence from Britain. Bengal had quietened over a four-year period, and the government released most of those interned under the Act of 1925 despite an unsuccessful attempt to forge an alliance between Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti. Some younger radicals struck out in new directions, and many (young and old) took part in Congress activities such as the 1928 anti-Simon Commission protests. Congress leader Lala Lajpat Rai died of injuries received when police broke up a Lahore protest march in October, and Bhagat Singh and other members of the HSRA avenged his death in December; Singh also later bombed the legislative assembly. He and other HSRA members were arrested, and three went on a hunger strike in jail; Bengali bomb-maker Jatindra Nath Das persisted in his strike until his death in September 1929. The Calcutta Corporation passed a condolence resolution after his death, as did Congress when Bhagat Singh was executed. Final phase Surya Sen, Jugantar leader and mastermind of the Chittagong raid. As the Congress-led movement picked up its pace during the early 1930s, some former revolutionaries identified with the Gandhian political movement and became influential Congressmen (notably Surendra Mohan Ghose). Many Bengali Congressmen also maintained links with the Samiti. Simultaneously with the nonviolent protests of the Gandhi-led Salt March, in April 1930, a group led by Surya Sen raided the Chittagong Armoury. In 1930 eleven British officials were killed, notably during the Writer's Building raid of December 1930 by Benoy Basu, Dinesh Gupta and Badal Gupta. Three successive district magistrates in Midnapore were assassinated, and dozens of other actions were carried out during the first half of the decade. By 1931 a record 92 violent incidents were recorded, including the murders of the British magistrates of Tippera and Midnapore. However, soon afterwards, in 1934, the revolutionary movement in Bengal ended. A large portion of the Samiti movement was attracted to left-wing politics during the 1930s, and those who did not join left-wing parties identified with Congress and the Congress Socialist Party. During the mass detentions of the 1930s surrounding the civil-disobedience movement, many members joined Congress. Jugantar was formally dissolved in 1938; many former members continued to act together under Surendra Mohan Ghose, who was a liaison between other Congress politicians and Aurobindo Ghose in Pondicherry. During the late 1930s, Marxist-leaning members of the Samiti in the CSP announced the formation of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP). Organisation=Structure Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were organised on different lines, reflecting their divergence. The Samiti was centrally organised, with a rigid discipline and vertical hierarchy. Jugantar was more loosely organised as an alliance of groups under local leaders that occasionally coordinated their actions. The prototype of Jugantar's organisation was Barin Ghosh's organisation set up in 1907, in the run-up to the Manicktala conspiracy. It sought to emulate the model of Russian revolutionaries described by Frost. The regulations of the central Dhaka organization of the Samiti were written down, and reproduced and summarised in government reports. According to one estimate, the Dacca Anushilan Samiti at one point had 500 branches, mostly in the eastern districts of Bengal, and 20,000 members. Branches were opened later in the western districts, Bihar, and the United Provinces. Shelters for absconders were established in Assam and in two farms in Tripura. Organisational documents show a primary division between the two active leaders, Barin Ghosh and Upendranath Bannerjee, and the rank-and-file. Higher leaders such as Aurobindo were supposed to be known only to the active leaders. Past members of the Samiti asserted that the groups were interconnected with a vast web of secret societies throughout British India. However, historian Peter Heehs concluded that the links between provinces were limited to contacts between a few individuals like Aurobindo who was familiar with leaders and movements in Western India, and that relationships among the different revolutionary groups were more often competitive than co-operative. An internal document of circa 1908 written by Pulin Behari Das describes the division of the organisation in Bengal, which largely followed British administrative divisions. Cadre Samiti membership was predominantly made up of Hindus, at least initially, which was ascribed to the religious oath of initiation being unacceptable to Muslims. Each member was assigned to one or more of three roles: collection of funds, implementation of planned actions and propaganda. In practice, however, the fundamental division was between \\"military‚Äô‚Äô work and ‚Äò‚Äòcivil‚Äô‚Äô work. Dals (teams) consisting of five or ten members led by a dalpati (team leader) were grouped together in local Samiti led by adhyakshas (executive officers) and other officers. These reported to district officers appointed by and responsible to the central Dhaka organization, commanded by Pulin Das and those who deputised for him during his periods of imprisonment. Samitis were divided into four functional groups: violence, organisation, keepers of arms, and householders. Communications were carried by special couriers and written in secret code. These practices and others were inspired by literary sources and were partly a concession to the desire of young men to act out romantic drama. Less is known about the Jugantar network, which took the place of the Manicktala society after the Alipore bomb case. It faced divisions similar to the Samiti. Historian Leonard Gordon notes that at least in the period between 1910 and 1915, the dals in the Jugantar network were separate units, led by a dada (lit: elder brother). The dada was also guru, teaching those under his command practical skills, revolutionary ideology, and strategy. Gordon suggests that the dada system developed out of pre-existing social structures in rural Bengal. Dadas both co-operated and competed with each other for men, money, and material. Many members of the Samiti came from upper castes. By 1918, nearly 90% of the revolutionaries killed or convicted were Brahmins, Kayasthas or Vaishyas. As the Samiti spread its influence to other parts of the country, particularly north India, it began to draw in people of other religions and of varying religious commitments. For example, many who joined the Hindustan Republican Socialist Association were Marxists and many were militant atheists. By the late 1930s, members with a more secular outlook were beginning to participate. Some components of the Samiti also included prominent participation from women, including Pritilata Waddedar who led a Jugantar attack during the Chittagong Armoury raid, and Kalpana Dutta who manufactured bombs at Chittagong. Ideologies=Indian philosophies The Samiti was influenced by the writings of the Bengali nationalist author Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. The name of the organisation, Anushilan, is derived from Bankim's works espousing hard work and spartan life. Bankim's cultural and martial nationalism, exemplified in Anandamath, along with his reinterpretation of the Bhagavat Gita, were strong influences on the strain of nationalism that inspired the early societies that later became Anushilan Samiti. A search of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti library in 1908 showed that Bankim's Bhagavat Gita was the most widely read book in the library. The philosophies and teachings of Swami Vivekananda were later added to this philosophy. The \\"Rules of Membership\\" in the Dacca library strongly recommended reading his books. These books emphasised \\"Strong muscles and nerves of steel\\", which some historians consider to be strongly influenced by the Hindu Shakta Philosophy. This interest in physical improvement and proto- national spirit among young Bengalis was driven by an effort to break away from the stereotype of effeminacy that the British had imposed on the Bengalis. Physical fitness was symbolic of the recovery of masculinity, and part of a larger moral and spiritual training to cultivate control over the body, and develop national pride and a sense of social responsibility and service. The physical culture movement became a craze ... this was a psychological attempt to break away from the colonial stereotype of effeminacy imposed on the Bengalees. Their symbolic recovery of masculinity ... remained parts of a larger moral and spiritual training to achieve mastery over body, develop a national pride and a sense of social service. Peter Heehs, writing in 2010, notes the Samiti had three pillars in their ideologies: \\"cultural independence\\", \\"political independence\\", and \\"economic independence\\". In terms of economic independence, the Samiti diverged from the Swadeshi movement, which they decried as a \\"trader's movement\\". \\"The ideology of revolutionary publicists such as Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghose ... had three major components: political independence or swaraj; economic independence as promoted by the swadeshi-boycott movement; and the drive for cultural independence by means of national education ... A circular of the Anushilan Samiti states: \\"This Samiti has no open relationship with any kind of popular and outward Swadeshi, that is (the boycott of) belati [foreign] articles ... To be mixed up in ... such affairs is entirely against the principles of the Samiti\\" (Ghosh 1984: 94). Members of Barin Ghose's group likewise stigmatized the swadeshi-boycott movement as bania (shopkeeper) politics.\\" European influences When the Samiti first came into prominence following the Muzaffarpur killings, its ideology was felt to be influenced by European anarchism. Lord Minto resisted the notion that its action might be the manifestation of political grievance by concluding that: However others disagreed. John Morley was of the opinion that the political violence exemplified by the Samiti was a manifestation of Indian antagonism to the government, although there were also influences of European nationalism and philosophies of liberalism. In the 1860s and 1870s, large numbers of akhras (gymnasiums) arose in Bengal that were consciously designed along the lines of the Italian Carbonari. \\"[Around 1881] a number of self-styled 'secret societies' were set up in Calcutta that were consciously modelled on the Carbonari and Mazzini's Young Italy Society ... They were in fact simply undergraduate clubs, long on nebulous ideals but short on action.\\" These were influenced by the works of Italian nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini and his Young Italy movement. Aurobindo himself studied the revolutionary nationalism of Ireland, France and America. \\"There were ... some foreign influences on Bengali Terrorism ... Aurobindo Ghose's study of the revolutionary movements of Ireland, France, and America. Members of the early 'secret societies' drew some of their inspiration from Mazzini ... The Japanese critic Kakuzo Okakura inspired Pramathanath Mitra and others with revolutionary and pan-Asiatic ideas just when the samiti movement was getting started. The Irishwoman Margaret Noble, known as Sister Nivedita after she became a disciple of Swami Vivekananda, had some contact with Aurobindo Ghose and with younger men like Satish Bose and Jugantar sub-editor Bhupendranath Bose. Nivedita was in correspondence with the non-terroristic anarchist Peter Kropotkin, and she is known to have had revolutionary beliefs. She gave the young men a collection of books that included titles on revolutionary history and spoke to them about their duty to the motherland ... undoubted connection of Hem Chandra Das with European revolutionaries in Paris in 1907.\\" Hem Chandra Das, during his stay in Paris, is also noted to have interacted with European radical nationalists in the city, returning to India an atheist with Marxist leanings. Okakura and Nivedita Foreign influences on the Samiti included the Japanese artist Kakuzo Okakura and Margaret Noble, an Irish woman known as Sister Nivedita. Okakura was a proponent of Pan-Asianism. He visited Swami Vivekananda in Calcutta in 1902, and inspired Pramathanath Mitra in the early days of the Samiti. However the extent of his involvement or influence is debated. Nivedita was a disciple of Swami Vivekananda. She had contacts with Aurobindo, with Satish Bose and with Jugantar sub-editor Bhupendranath Bose. Nivedita is believed to have influenced members of the Samiti by talking about their duties to the motherland and providing literature on revolutionary nationalism. She was a correspondent of Peter Kropotkin, a noted anarchist. Later influences A major section of the Anushilan movement had been attracted to Marxism during the 1930s, many of them studying Marxist‚ÄìLeninist literature whilst serving long jail sentences. A minority broke away from the Samiti and joined the Communist Consolidation, and later the Communist Party of India (CPI). The majority of the Anushilan Marxists were hesitant to join the Communist Party, however, since they distrusted the political lines formulated by the Communist International.Saha, Murari Mohan (ed.), Documents of the Revolutionary Socialist Party: Volume One 1938‚Äì1947. Agartala: Lokayata Chetana Bikash Society, 2001. pp. 20‚Äì21 They also did not embrace Trotskyism, although they shared some Trotskyite critiques of the leadership of Joseph Stalin. Impact=Police reaction and reforms Shortly after its inception, the Samiti became the focus of extensive police and intelligence operation. Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against them at various times included Sir Robert Nathan, Sir Harold Stuart, Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore and Sir Charles Tegart. The CIDs of Bengal and the provinces of Eastern Bengal and Assam were founded in response to the revolutionary movement led by the Samiti. By 1908, political crime duties took the services of one deputy Superintendent of Police, 52 Inspectors and Sub- Inspectors, and nearly 720 constables. Foreseeing a rise in the strength of the revolutionary movement, Sir Harold Stuart (then Secretary of State for India) implemented plans for secret service to fight the menace posed by the Samiti. A Political Crime branch of the C.I.D. (known as the \\"Special Department\\") was developed in September 1909, staffed by 23 officers and 45 men. The government of India allocated Rs 2,227,000 for the Bengal Police alone in the reforms of 1909-1910. By 1908 a Special Officer for Political Crime was appointed from the Bengal Police, with the Special Branch of Police working under him. This post was first occupied by C.W.C. Plowden and later by F.C. Daly. Godfrey Denham, then Assistant Superintendent of Police, served under the Special Officer. Denham was credited with uncovering the Manicktala safe house of the Samiti, raiding it in May 1908, which ultimately led to the Manicktala conspiracy case. This case led to further expansion of the Special Branch in Bengal. The CID in Eastern Bengal and Assam (EBA) were founded in 1906 and expanded from 1909 onwards. However, the EBA police's access to informers and secret agents remained difficult. In EBA, a civil servant, H.L. Salkeld, uncovered the eastern branch of Anushilan Samiti, producing a four- volume report and placing 68 suspects under surveillance. However the Samiti evaded detailed intrusion by adopting the model of Russian revolutionaries. Until 1909, the police were unclear whether they were dealing with a single organisation or with a conglomeration of independent groups. The visit of King George V to India in 1911 catalyzed improvements in police equipment and staffing in Bengal and EBA. In 1912, the political branch of the Bengal CID was renamed the Intelligence Branch, staffed with 50 officers and 127 men. The branch had separate sections dealing with explosives, assassinations, and robberies. It was headed by Charles Tegart, who built up a network of agents and informers to infiltrate the Samiti. Tegart would meet his agents under cover of darkness, at times disguising himself as a pathan or kabuliwallah. Assisting Denham and Petrie, Tegart led the investigation in the aftermath of the Dalhi-Lahore Conspiracy and identified Chandernagore as the main hub for the Samiti. Tegart remained in the Bengal police until at least the 1930s, earning notoriety amongst the Samiti for his work, and was subjected to a number of assassination attempts. In 1924, Ernest Day, an Englishman, was shot dead by Gopinath Saha at Chowringhee Road in Calcutta, due to being mistaken for Tegart. In 1930, a bomb was thrown into Tegart's car at Dalhousie Square but Tegart managed to shoot the revolutionary and escaped unhurt. His efficient curbing of the revolutionary movement earned praise from Lord Lytton and he was awarded the King's medal. In 1937 Tegart was sent to the British Mandate of Palestine, then in the throes of the Arab Revolt, to advise the Inspector General on security. Criminal Law Amendment 1908 In its fight against the Raj, the Samitis members who turned approvers (i.e. gave evidence against their colleagues) and the Bengal Police staff who were investigating the Samiti were consistently targeted. A number of assassinations were carried out of approvers who had agreed to act as crown witnesses. In 1909 Naren Gossain, crown witness for the prosecution in Alipore bomb case, was shot dead within Alipore Jail by Satyendranath Boseu and Kanai Lal Dutt. Ashutosh Biswas, an advocate of Calcutta High Court in charge of prosecution of Gossain murder case, was shot dead within Calcutta High Court in 1909. In 1910, Shamsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Bengal Police responsible for investigating the Alipore bomb case, was shot dead on the steps of Calcutta High Court. The failures of a number of prosecutions of violence linked to the Samiti under the Criminal Procedures Act of 1898 led to a special act that provided for crimes of nationalist violence to be tried by a special tribunal composed of three high-court judges. In December 1908 the Criminal Law amendments were passed under the terms of Regulation III of 1818, with the goal of suppressing associations formed for seditious conspiracies. The act was first applied to deport nine Bengali revolutionaries to Mandalay prison in 1908. Despite these measures however, the high standards of evidence demanded by the Calcutta High Court, insufficient investigations by police, and at times outright fabrication of evidence, led to persistent failures to tame nationalist violence. [There are] records of cases during the years from 1908 to 1914 which were abortive ... due to the usual faults of police work in India‚Äîthe hankering~after approvers and confessions, to be obtained by any means, good or bad; the concoction of a little evidence to make a bad case good- or a good case better; and the suppression of facts which fail to fit the theory. The police forces felt unable to deal with the operations of secretive nationalist organisations, leading to demands for special powers. The Indian press opposed these demands strenuously, arguing against any extension of the already wide powers enjoyed by the police forces in India, which they claimed were already being used to oppress the Indian people. Police authorities took up the attitude that ... they were helpless in the face of a secret organisation ... Demands were put forward for special powers, the lowering of the standard of evidence, and other devices for the easy success of the police ... the whole Indian Press anticipated with the liveliest apprehension the prospect of any extension of those wide powers which already enabled the police to oppress the people. Defence of India Act The threat posed by the activities of the Samiti in Bengal during World War I, along with the threat of a Ghadarite uprising in Punjab, led to the passage of Defence of India Act 1915. The act received universal support from Indian non-officiating members in the Governor General's council and from moderate leaders within the Indian political movement. The British war effort had received popular support within India and the act received support on the understanding that the measures enacted were necessary in the war situation. These measures enabled the arrest, internment, transportation, and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, which crushed the East Bengal branch of the Samiti. Its application led to 46 executions, as well as 64 life sentences given to revolutionaries in Bengal and Punjab in the Lahore Conspiracy Trial and Benares Conspiracy Trial, and in tribunals in Bengal, effectively crushing the revolutionary movement. By March 1916, widespread arrests had helped Bengal Police crush the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti in Calcutta. The power of preventive detention was used extensively in Bengal, and revolutionary violence in Bengal plummeted to 10 incidents in 1917. By the end of the war there were over 800 detainees under the act in Bengal under the act. However, indiscriminate application of the act made it increasingly unpopular with the Indian public. Rowlatt act The 1915 act was designed to expire in 1919, and the Rowlatt Committee was appointed to recommend measures to continue to suppress the revolutionary movement. The committee recommended an extension of the provisions of the Defence of India Act for a further three years with the removal of habeas corpus provisions. However this was met with universal opposition by the Indian members of the Viceroy's council, as well as the population in general, and Gandhi called the proposed act \\"The Black Bills\\". Mohammed Ali Jinnah left the Viceroy's council in protest, after having warned the council of the danger of enacting such an unpopular bill. Nevertheless, the recommendations were enacted in the Rowlatt Bills. Gandhi then led a protest, the Rowlatt Satyagraha, one of the first civil disobedience movements that would become the Indian independence movement. The protests included hartals in Delhi, public protests in Punjab, and other protest movements across India. In Punjab, the protests culminated in the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre in April 1919. After nearly three years of agitation, the government finally repealed the Rowlatt act and its component sister acts. Bengal Criminal Law Amendment A resurgence of radical nationalism linked to the Samiti after 1922 led to the implementation of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment in 1924, which reinstated the powers of incarceration and detention from the Defence of India Act. The act re- introduced extraordinary powers of detention to the police, and by 1927 more than 200 suspects had been imprisoned, including Subhas Chandra Bose. The implementation of the act successfully curtailed a resurgence in nationalist violence in Bengal, at a time when the Hindustan Republican Association was rising in the United Provinces. \\"The activity and influence of the Bengal terrorists led to the passage in 1924 of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, extended the next year as an Act. This again gave the police extraordinary powers, and between 1924 and 1927 almost 200 suspects were imprisoned, among them Subhas Bose. Acts of terrorism in Bengal dropped off, but an Anushilan-linked group in the United Provinces [the Hindustan Republican Association] grew to some importance.\\" After the 1920s, the Anushilan Samiti gradually dissolved into the Gandhian movement. Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress, then led by Subhas Chandra Bose, while others identified more closely with Communism. The Jugantar branch formally dissolved in 1938. In independent India, the party in West Bengal evolved into the Revolutionary Socialist Party, while the Eastern Branch later evolved into the Sramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal (Workers and Peasants Socialist Party) in present-day Bangladesh. Influence=Revolutionary nationalism The nationalist publication Jugantar, which served as the organ of the Samiti, inspired fanatical loyalty among its readers. \\"The Jugantar newspaper served as the propaganda vehicle for a loose congregation of revolutionaries led by individuals like Jain Banerjee and Barin Ghose who drew inspiration from ... Aurobindo Ghose.\\" \\"This attitude cost the paper dearly. It suffered five more prosecutions that, by July 1908, brought about its financial ruin ‚Ä¶ The trials brought the paper a great deal of publicity and helped greatly in the dissemination of the revolutionary ideology ... testimony to the fanatical loyalty that the paper inspired in its readers and the deep impression that the Jugantar writings made on them ... revolutionary terrorism as an ideology began to win if not overt, then at least the tacit, support of Bengalis.\\" By 1907 it was selling 7,000 copies, which later rose to 20,000. Its message was aimed at elite politically conscious readers and was essentially a critique of British rule in India and justification of political violence. \\"[Sanyal translates from Jugantar:] \\"In a country where the ruling power relies on brute force to oppress its subjects, it is impossible to bring about Revolution or a change in rulers through moral strength. In such a situation, subjects too must rely on brute force.\\" ... The Jugantar challenged the legitimacy of British rule ... [its] position thus amounted to a fundamental critique of the British government ... By 1907 the paper was selling 7000 copies, a figure that went up to 20,000 soon after. The Jugantar ideology was basically addressed to an elite audience that was young, literate and politically radicalized.\\" Several young men who joined the Samiti credited Jugantar with influencing their decisions. The editor of the paper, Bhupendranath Datta, was arrested and sentenced to one year's rigorous imprisonment in 1907. \\"Bhupendranath Dutt, the editor and proprietor of the Jugantar was arrested in July 1907 and charged under section 124 A ... Bhupendranath was sentenced to a year's rigorous imprisonment ... The Jugantar's stance was typically defiant ... The paper did nothing to tone down the rhetoric in its future editions.\\" The Samiti responded by attempting to assassinate Douglas Kingsford, who presided over the trial, and Jugantar responded with defiant editorials. Jugantar was repeatedly prosecuted, leaving it in financial ruins by 1908. However, the prosecutions brought the paper more publicity and helped disseminate the Samiti's ideology of revolutionary nationalism. Historian Shukla Sanyal has commented that revolutionary terrorism as an ideology began to win at least tacit support amongst a significant populace at this time. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, the founder of the Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), was an alumnus of the Anushilan Samiti. He was sent to Calcutta by B. S. Moonje in 1910 to study medicine, and to learn techniques of violent nationalism from secret revolutionary organizations in Bengal. There he lived with independence activist Shyam Sundar Chakravarty,M. L. Verma Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas (Part-2) p.466 and had contacts with revolutionaries like Ram Prasad Bismil. Indian independence movement James Popplewell, writing in 1995, noted that the Raj perceived the Samiti in its early days as a serious threat to its rule. However, historian Sumit Sarkar noted that the Samiti never mustered enough support to offer an urban rebellion or a guerrilla campaign. Both Peter Heehs and Sumit Sarkar have noted that the Samiti called for complete independence over 20 years before the Congress adopted this as its aim. A number of landmark events early in the Indian independence movement, including the revolutionary conspiracies of World War I, involved the Samiti, as noted in the Rowlatt report. Later the ascendant left-wing of the Congress, particularly Subhas Chandra Bose, was suspected of having links with the Samiti. Heehs argued that the actions of the revolutionary nationalists exemplified by the Samiti forced the government to parley more seriously with the leaders of the legitimate movement, and that Gandhi was always aware of this. \\"At the Round Table Conference of 1931, the apostle of non-violence declared that he held 'no brief for the terrorists', but added that if the government refused to work with him, it would have the terrorists to deal with. The only way to 'say good-bye to terrorism' was 'to work the Congress for all it is worth'\\". Social influences The founders of the Samiti were among the leading luminaries of Bengal at the time, advocating for social change in ways far removed from the violent nationalist works that identified the Samiti in later years. The young men of Bengal were among the most active in the Swadeshi movement, prompting R.W. Carlyle to prohibit the participation of students in political meetings on the threat of withdrawal of funding and grants. Bengali intellectuals were already calling for indigenous schools and colleges to replace British institutions, and seeking to build indigenous institutions. Surendranath Tagore, of the Tagore family of Calcutta financed the establishment of Indian-owned banks and insurance companies. The 1906 Congress session in Calcutta established the National Council of Education as a nationalist agency to promote Indian institutions with their own independent curriculum designed to provide skills in technical and technological education that its founders felt would be necessary for building indigenous industries. With the financial backing of Subodh Chandra Mallik, the Bengal National College (which later grew to be Jadavpur University) was established with Aurobindo as Principal. Aurobindo participated in the Indian National Congress at the time. He used his platform in the Congress to present the Samiti as a conglomeration of youth clubs, even as the government raised fears that it was a revolutionary nationalist organisation. During his time as Principal, Aurobindo started the nationalist publications Jugantar, Karmayogin and Bande Mataram. The student's mess at the college was frequented by students of East Bengal who belonged to the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti, and was known to be a hotbed of revolutionary nationalism, which was uncontrolled or even encouraged by the college. Students of the college who later rose to prominence in the Indian revolutionary movement include M. N. Roy. The Samitis ideologies further influenced patriotic nationalism. Communism in India M. N. Roy, one of the founding fathers of Indian Communism as well as the Mexican Communist Party. He was a member of the Comintern. Through the 1920s and 1930s, many members of the Samiti began identifying with Communism and leftist ideologies. Many of them studied Marxist‚ÄìLeninist literature while serving long jail sentences. A minority section broke away from the Anushilan movement and joined the Communist Consolidation, and later the Communist Party of India. Former Jugantar leader Narendranath Bhattacharya, now known as M. N. Roy, became an influential member of the Communist International, helping to found the Communist Party of India. The majority of the Anushilanite Marxists hesitated to join the Communist Party. Instead, they joined the Congress Socialist Party (CSP), but kept a separate identity within the party as the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP).Saha, Murari Mohan (ed.), Documents of the Revolutionary Socialist Party: Volume One 1938‚Äì1947. Agartala: Lokayata Chetana Bikash Society, 2001. p. 35-37 The RSP held a strong influence in parts of Bengal. The party sent two parliamentarians to the 1952 Lok Sabha elections, both previously Samiti members. In 1969, RSP sympathizers in East Pakistan formed the Shramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal (SKSD). RSP and SKSD have maintained close ties ever since. The RSP is currently a minor partner in the Left Front, which ruled the Indian state of West Bengal for 34 uninterrupted years. It also holds influence in South India, notably in parts of Kerala. The SUCI, another left-wing party with a presence in Bengal, was founded in 1948 by Anushilan members. In popular culture The revolutionaries of the Samiti became household names in Bengal. Many of these educated and youthful men were widely admired and romanticised throughout India. Ekbar biday de Ma ghure ashi (Bid me farewell, mother), a 1908 song written by Bengali folk poet Pitambar Das that describes the execution of Khudiram Bose, was popular in Bengal decades after Bose's death. The railway station where Bose was arrested is now named Khudiram Bose Pusa Railway Station in his honour. The 1926 nationalist novel Pather Dabi (Right of the way) by Bengali author Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay tells the story of a secret revolutionary nationalist organisation fighting the Raj. The protagonist of the novel, Sabyasachi, is believed to have been modelled after Rash Behari Bose, while the revolutionary organisation is thought to have been influenced by the Bengali Samiti. The novel was banned by The Raj as \\"seditious\\", but acquired wild popularity. It formed the basis of a 1977 Bengali language film, Sabyasachi, with Uttam Kumar playing the lead role of the protagonist. Do and Die is a historical account of the Chittagong armoury raid published in 2000 by Indian author Manini Chatterjee. It was awarded the Rabindra Puraskar, the highest literary award in Bengal. The book formed the basis of Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey (We Play with Our Lives), a 2010 Bollywood film with Abhishek Bachchan playing the role of Surya Sen. A marble plaque marks the building in Calcutta where the Samiti was founded. A plaque at the site of Barin Ghose's country house (in present-day Ultadanga) marks the site where Ghosh and his group was arrested in the Alipore bomb case. Many of the Samiti's members are known in India and abroad, and are commemorated in different forms. A number of Calcutta suburbs are today named after revolutionaries and nationalists of the Samiti. Grey Street, where Aurobindo Ghosh's press office stood, is today named Aurobido Sarani (Aurobindo Avenue). Dalhousie Square was renamed B.B.D Bag, named after Benoy, Badal, and Dinesh who raided the Writer's Building in 1926. Mononga lane, the site of Rodda & Co. heist, houses the busts of Anukul Mukherjee, Srish Chandra Mitra, Haridas Dutta, and Bipin Bihary Ganguly who participated in the heist. Chashakhand, a location 15 km east of Balasore where Bagha Jatin and his group made their last stand against Tegart's forces, commemorates the battlefield in Jatin's honour. The locality of Baghajatin in Kolkata is named after Jatin. In Bangladesh, the gallows where Surya Sen was executed are preserved as a historical monument.

Biography The son of a London wine merchant, Anthony Merry served in various diplomatic posts in Europe between 1783 and 1803, holding mostly consular positions. In 1803 he married Elizabeth Leathes, widow of John Leathes of Herringfield House, Suffolk. He was Charg√© d'Affaires in Madrid in 1796 and again in Copenhagen about 1799, and Minister ad interim in Paris in 1802.Malcolm Lester, 'Merry, Anthony (1756‚Äì1835)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 , accessed 29 Dec 2008 Merry was Britain's representative to the United States in Washington, D.C. from 1803 to 1806. When Merry arrived in the United States, he was received without any hospitality by President Thomas Jefferson, who greeted him in casual clothes and bedroom slippers and was inclined to show hostility towards Britain through Merry. Merry and his wife were invited to dinner at the White House along with the French charg√© d'affaires and his wife at a time when the two countries were at war with one another.Henry Adams, History of the United States of America during the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson, Library of America, 1986, p. 551 et seq. When Merry made a complaint about protocol to James Madison, Madison increased the offence by referring to it as \\"a matter of very little moment\\". Jefferson's hostility extended to Mrs. Merry, whom he called a \\"virago\\", though Aaron Burr greatly admired her. From then on Merry found himself disgusted by America. Soon after, Aaron Burr came to Merry seeking help with detaching the Ohio and Mississippi valleys from the Union. Merry reported back to the Foreign Office that Burr was extremely willing and ready to seek revenge against the United States. In April 1805 Merry was again approached by Burr, who claimed that Louisiana was ready to leave the United States. Burr, however, after being dropped from the Presidential ticket, had not the money nor power to seize Louisiana. He therefore sought assistance from Britain through Merry. Unfortunately for Merry and Burr, Britain had a new Foreign Secretary, Charles James Fox, who was friendly with America. Fox found the request treasonous, and on June 1, 1806, recalled Merry to Britain.Op. cit., p. 775 Burr's intention was no doubt to exploit the dissatisfaction of the populace of Louisiana with the purchase.Henry Adams, History of the United States during the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson Library of America, p. 574 ff. Merry did not expect to be employed again, but in 1807 the new British government sent him to Copenhagen to conciliate the Danes over the bombardment of Copenhagen. Merry was then sent as British Minister to Sweden from 1808, a post from which he retired in 1809. He then lived at Dedham, Essex until his death in 1835. Merry was notorious for his grim and dour manner: Napoleon facetiously nicknamed him Toujours gai. He and his wife had a reputation for arrogance and petulance: Thomas Moore, who shared their voyage to America, later became a good friend but admitted that their incessant complaining made them bad traveling companions.

Found in multicellular eukaryotes and working over distances from the promoter element of the target gene, an insulator is typically 300 bp to 2000 bp in length. Insulators contain clustered binding sites for sequence specific DNA-binding proteins and mediate intra- and inter- chromosomal interactions. Insulators function either as an enhancer-blocker or a barrier, or both. The mechanisms by which an insulator performs these two functions include loop formation and nucleosome modifications. There are many examples of insulators, including the CTCF insulator, the gypsy insulator, and the Œ≤-globin locus. The CTCF insulator is especially important in vertebrates, while the gypsy insulator is implicated in Drosophila. The Œ≤-globin locus was first studied in chicken and then in humans for its insulator activity, both of which utilize CTCF. The genetic implications of insulators lie in their involvement in a mechanism of imprinting and their ability to regulate transcription. Mutations to insulators are linked to cancer as a result of cell cycle disregulation, tumourigenesis, and silencing of growth suppressors.  Function  Insulators have two main functions: # Enhancer-blocking insulators prevent distal enhancers from acting on the promoter of neighbouring genes # Barrier insulators prevent silencing of euchromatin by the spread of neighbouring heterochromatin While enhancer-blocking is classified as an inter-chromosomal interaction, acting as a barrier is classified as an intra-chromosomal interaction. The need for insulators arises where two adjacent genes on a chromosome have very different transcription patterns; it is critical that the inducing or repressing mechanisms of one do not interfere with the neighbouring gene. Insulators have also been found to cluster at the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) and may have a role in partitioning the genome into \\"chromosome neighborhoods\\" - genomic regions within which regulation occurs. Some insulators can act as both enhancer blocker and barriers, and some just have one of the two functions. Some examples of different insulators are: * Drosophila melanogaster insulators gypsy and scs scs are both enhancer-blocking insulators * Gallus gallus have insulators, Lys 5' A that have both enhancer- blocking and barrier activity, as well as HS4 that have only enhancer-blocking activity * Saccharomyces cerevisiae insulators STAR and UASrpg are both barrier insulators * Homo sapiens HS5 insulator acts as an enhancer-blocker Mechanism of action= Enhancer-blocking insulators  250x250px Similar mechanism of action for enhancer-blocking insulators; chromatin loop domains are formed in the nucleus that separates the enhancer and the promoter of a target gene. Loop domains are formed through the interaction between enhancer- blocking elements interacting with each other or securing chromatin fibre to structural elements within the nucleus. The action of these insulators is dependent on being positioned between the promoter of the target gene and the upstream or down stream enhancer. The specific way in which insulators block enhancers is dependent on the enhancers mode of action. Enhancers can directly interact with their target promoters through looping (direct-contact model), in which case an insulator prevents this interaction through the formation of a loop domain that separates the enhancer and promoter sites and prevents the promoter-enhancer loop from forming. An enhancer can also act on a promoter through a signal (tracking model of enhancer action). This signal may be blocked by an insulator through the targeting of a nucleoprotein complex at the base of the loop formation.  Barrier insulators  Barrier activity has been linked to the disruption of specific processes in the heterochromatin formation pathway. These types of insulators modify the nucleosomal substrate in the reaction cycle that is central to heterochromatin formation. Modifications are achieved through various mechanisms including nucleosome removal, in which nucleosome-excluding elements disrupt heterochromatin from spreading and silencing (chromatin-mediated silencing). Modification can also be done through recruitment of histone acetyltransferase(s) and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling complexes.  CTCF insulator  The CTCF insulator appears to have enhancer blocking activity via its 3D structure and have no direct connection with barrier activity. Vertebrates in particular appear to rely heavily on the CTCF insulator, however there are many different insulator sequences identified. Insulated neighborhoods formed by physical interaction between two CTCF-bound DNA loci contain the interactions between enhancers and their target genes.  Regulation  One mechanism of regulating CTCF is via methylation of its DNA sequence. CTCF protein is known to favourably bind to unmethylated sites, so it follows that methylation of CpG islands is a point of epigenetic regulation. An example of this is seen in the Igf2-H19 imprinted locus where methylation of the paternal imprinted control region (ICR) prevents CTCF from binding. A second mechanism of regulation is through regulating proteins that are required for fully functioning CTCF insulators. These proteins include, but are not limited to cohesin, RNA polymerase, and CP190.  gypsy insulator  The insulator element that is found in the gypsy retrotransposon of Drosophila is one of several sequences that have been studied in detail. The gypsy insulator can be found in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the retrotransposon element. Gypsy affects the expression of adjacent genes pending insertion into a new genomic location, causing mutant phenotypes that are both tissue specific and present at certain developmental stages. The insulator likely has an inhibitory effect on enhancers that control the spatial and temporal expression of the affected gene.  Œ≤-globin locus  The first examples of insulators in vertebrates was seen in the chicken Œ≤-globin locus, cHS4. cHS4 marks the border between the active euchromatin in the Œ≤-globin locus and the upstream heterochromatin region that is highly condensed and inactive. The cHS4 insulator acts as both a barrier to chromatin-mediated silencing via heterochromatin spreading, and blocks interactions between enhancers and promoters. A distinguishing characteristic of cHS4 is that it has a repetitive heterochromatic region on its 5' end. The human Œ≤-globin locus homologue of cHS4 is HS5. Different from the chicken Œ≤-globin locus, the human Œ≤-globin locus has an open chromatin structure and is not flanked by a 5' heterochromatic region. HS5 is thought to be a genetic insulator in vivo as it has both enhancer-blocking activity and transgene barrier activities. CTCF was first characterized for its role in regulating Œ≤-globin gene expression. At this locus, CTCF functions as an insulator- binding protein forming a chromosomal boundary. CTCF is present in both the chicken Œ≤-globin locus and human Œ≤-globin locus. Within cHS4 of the chicken Œ≤-globin locus, CTCF binds to a region (FII) that is responsible for enhancer blocking activity.  Genetic implications = Imprinting  The ability of enhancers to activate imprinted genes is dependent on the presence of an insulator on the unmethylated allele between the two genes. An example of this is the Igf2-H19 imprinted locus. In this locus the CTCF protein regulates imprinted expression by binding to the unmethylated maternal imprinted control region (ICR) but not on the paternal ICR. When bound to the unmethylated maternal sequence, CTCF effectively blocks downstream enhancer elements from interacting with the Igf2 gene promoter, leaving only the H19 gene to be expressed.  Transcription  When insulator sequences are located in close proximity to the promoter of a gene, it has been suggested that they might serve to stabilize enhancer-promoter interactions. When they are located farther away from the promoter, insulator elements would compete with the enhancer and interfere with activation of transcription. Loop formation is common in eukaryotes to bring distal elements (enhancers, promoters, locus control regions) into closer proximity for interaction during transcription. The mechanism of enhancer-blocking insulators then, if in the correct position, could play a role in regulating transcription activation.  Mutations and cancer  CTCF insulators affect the expression of genes implicated in cell cycle regulation processes that are important for cell growth, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Two of these cell cycle regulation genes that are known to interact with CTCF are hTERT and C-MYC. In these cases, a loss of function mutation to the CTCF insulator gene changes the expression patterns and may affect the interplay between cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis and lead to tumourigenesis or other problems. CTCF is also required for the expression of tumour repressor retinoblastoma (Rb) gene and mutations and deletions of this gene are associated with inherited malignancies. When the CTCF binding site is removed expression of Rb is decreased and tumours are able to thrive. Other genes that encode cell cycle regulators include BRCA1, and p53, which are growth suppressors that are silenced in many cancer types, and whose expression is controlled by CTCF. Loss of function of CTCF in these genes leads to the silencing of the growth suppressor and contributes to the formation of cancer.

The company was founded in 1926 and was purchased by Energizer in 2003 from Pfizer. Energizer split into two companies in 2015 and Schick became part of Edgewell Personal Care. History Schick was founded in 1926 by Jacob Schick as the Magazine Repeating Razor Company. That same year, Schick introduced its highly successful single blade safety razor system, that stored twenty blades in a steel injector. Schick sold the company in 1928 to start another unrelated company bearing his name which marketed his newly invented electric shavers. On July 1, 2015, Energizer split into two companies with Schick falling under Edgewell Personal Care. While second in sales to Gillette globally, Schick is the top selling brand of safety razors and blades in Japan. The Schick brand is used in North America, Australia, Asia and Russia.

Its range continues south in the highlands to Honduras. Although occurring at lower elevations during the Pleistocene, it generally is limited now to highlands supporting open coniferous forests or woodlands. In a few places, it occurs in lower country where lava or boulder fields occur; presumably the presence of spaces extending far below the surface enables survival. Like most members of the genus living in rocky areas, dens tend to take advantage of crevices, rock shelters, and caves; stick nests are relatively rare. The type locality is near Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico. Some 26 species names have been applied to populations of the Mexican woodrat and are now considered synonyms. The animal averages a bit over 300 mm in total length and weighs 140 to 185 g.

The Tanem village itself and surrounding areas provides few employment opportunities and most of the residents of Tanem commute to Trondheim to work. Location The village of Tanem lies at the foot of Vassfjellet and stretches westwards almost down to the river Nidelva. Vassfjellet and the forested areas around the village provides ample room for outdoors activities, like hiking, mountain biking, and foraging for berries. The local skiing clubs include Freidig Alpin and Vassfjellet SK. The local Motorcycle Club Sprengstart MC was founded here in 1983. Industries Tanem and the areas along the Vassfjellet mountain has been a large source of naturally occurring sand and gravel and during the last 30 years has seen the establishment of several large gravel pits. This is because Tanem has been below sea level during various ice ages, and large amounts of glacifluvial residue were piled up here. Other industries in the vicinity of Tanem include logging and a water-powered electrical plant. History The village of Tanem dates back to before the Viking era. The hill today known as Tanems√•sen was fortified in ancient times, the remnants of this still exist and have been excavated. This hill gave its name to the municipality Kl√¶bu in which Tanem lies, the name Kl√¶bu being derived from the old Kl√¶ppabu, which means \\"the place where people live under the hill with a fort on it\\".

The headquarters of the daily is in Beirut. It has been in circulation from March 1974 until December 2016. The last issue of the paper was published on 31 December 2016. The online version was also closed on the same date. History and profile As-Safir was first published by Talal Salman on 26 March 1974 as an Arabic political daily. Talal Salman also served as chief editor of the paper. In 2005, the daily's chief editor was late Joseph Samaha. The publisher of the daily is Dar Al Safir. It is published in broadsheet format. On 18 July 2011, the paper, together with Al Akhbar, another daily published in Lebanon, was banned in Syria. As-Safir had a weekly page on the environmental issues. Political approach As-Safir stated its mission as to be \\"the newspaper of Lebanon in the Arab world and the newspaper of the Arab world in Lebanon.\\" (in Arabic ÿ¨ÿ±ŸäÿØÿ© ŸÑÿ®ŸÜÿßŸÜ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä Ÿàÿ¨ÿ±ŸäÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä ŸÅŸä ŸÑÿ®ŸÜÿßŸÜ) This remained the slogan printed on the paper's masthead.

It also focused on issues pertaining to the Muslim world, advocated Arab nationalism, was close to Hezbollah and had a pro-Syrian stance. Another Lebanese daily, An-Nahar, was cited as the biggest rival of As-Safir. In the mid-1990s, the paper was described as a left-of-center paper, whereas An-Nahar as a right-of- center paper. During the same period, As-Safir was also described by Robert Fisk as a Syrian-backed newspaper. In the 2000s these papers were again supporters of two opposite poles in Lebanon, in that An-Nahar is a supporter of March 14 alliance, whereas As-Safir supported March 8 alliance. Circulation and websites As-Safir had the second highest circulation in the 1990s after An-Nahar. Its circulation was 45,000 copies in 2003, being the second best selling paper in Lebanon. In 2012, the Lebanese Ministry of Information stated that the daily had a circulation of 50,000 copies, being the first in the country. In addition to its Arabic website, the paper had also an English website. The paper's online version was the 16th most visited website for 2010 in the MENA region.

The horse picks up and sets down its feet almost in diagonal pairs, and moves straight backwards with the line of his forelegs following those of his hind. The horse should remain on the aids during the rein-back. The rein-back should be practiced sparingly, as it can easily over- stress the horse's back and joints. This is especially true if the rider tries to force the horse into the movement. Asking for the Rein-Back The reinback, clearly helping to engage the horse's hind end. To perform the rein- back, the rider applies both leg aids and a resisting hand. The leg asks the horse to move, but the hand prevents the horse from going forward, so it instead releases that energy in a step back. As soon as the horse begins to step back, the aids are released. The rein-back should be performed in a straight line, with the rider's legs used softly behind the girth to keep the hindquarters straight. The upper body of the rider stays upright, leaning neither forward nor back. Leaning back is especially bad, as it drives the seat bones of the rider into the horse, causing the animal to hollow its back. It is sometimes useful to transfer the weight of the seat onto the thighs when asking for the rein back, so that the horse may easily round up through its back and engage its hind end. When the rider wishes the horse to stop moving back, the rider sits deeper into his seat, adds more leg, and lightens his contact with the horse's mouth. Common Faults One of the most common faults in the rein-back is resistance by the horse. Instead of remaining on the aids, the animal tenses up and throws his head up or does not soften to the bit. This is usually the case if the rider tries to pull the horse backwards rather than asking with the legs aids or if the rider sits too heavily on his mount's back. Other faults may include crookedness, laziness (horse is inactive and drags his feet), or rushing. Uses of the Rein-Back The rein-back is occasionally asked for in equitation classes, in dressage tests (Grand Prix, eventing, and combined driving), reining competition, and is also invaluable on the trail, as it can be used to maneuver out of a tight situation. The rein-back is also an excellent training tool. The movement requires the horse to engage and move his weight to his hindquarters.

Design and development=Background The Falklands War in 1982 took a heavy toll on the Argentine Air Force, which lost over 60 aircraft. Due to the deteriorating national economic situation and political distrust of the military, the Air Force was denied the resources needed to replace its war losses. The supply of modern combat aircraft had been restricted since the United States had imposed an arms embargo in 1978 for human rights abuses;backing the Humphrey-Kennedy amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1976, the Carter administration placed an embargo on the sale of arms and spare parts to Argentina and on the training of its military personnel there were further restrictions when the United Kingdom also imposed an arms embargo in 1982. The only combat aircraft that the Air Force could obtain were 10 Mirage 5Ps transferred from the Peruvian Air Force, 19 Six-Day War veteran Mirage IIICJs from Israel, and 2 Mirage IIIB trainers from the French Air Force. In 1989, Carlos Menem was elected President of Argentina and quickly established a pro-United States foreign policy which led to the country gaining Major non-NATO ally status.... represents our recognition of the importance of Argentina's leadership and cooperation in the field ofinternational peacekeeping, notably during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, in Haiti, in its role in supervising the peace between Peru and Ecuador, and in nearly a dozen other international peacekeeping efforts ...

In 1994, the United States made a counteroffer to modernize 36 former US Marine Corps A-4M Skyhawks in a US$282 million deal that would be carried out by Lockheed Martin and included the privatization of the Fabrica Militar de Aviones (Military Aircraft Factory), which was renamed Lockheed Martin Aircraft Argentina SA afterward.

At least ten TA-4J and A-4M airframes for use as spare parts, eight additional engines, and a new A-4AR simulator were also delivered. Operational history Overflying the Obelisk of Buenos Aires during the Argentina Bicentennial The Fightinghawks, having received Air Force serials C-901 to C-936, saw their first group arrive in Argentina on 18 December 1997 and the first \\"Argentine\\" A-4AR was rolled out on 3 August 1998 at Cordoba. The last one, number 936, was delivered to the Air Force in March 2000. Two aircraft (a one-seat and a two-seat) remain some time in the United States for weapons homologation. All of the A-4ARs were delivered to the 5th Air Brigade (V Brigada A√©rea) at Villa Reynolds, San Luis Province, where they replaced two squadrons of Falklands/Malvinas veteran A-4P (locally known A-4B) and A-4C. They were soon deployed in rotation around the country from Rio Gallegos in the south to Resistencia in the north where they were used to intercept smugglers and drug trafficking airplanes. In September 1998, just months after their arrival and again in April 2001, United States Air Force F-16s visited Villa Reynolds for the Southern Falcon joint exercise, known as Aguila (Spanish for Eagle) in Argentina. In 2004, the A-4ARs went abroad for the joint exercise Cruzex, along with Brazilian F-5s and Mirages, Venezuelan F-16s and French Mirage 2000s.

Design of the Krak√≥w z≈Çoty mirrors a significant resemblance to the Polish z≈Çoty The Krak√≥w z≈Çoty () - was a currency issued in the independent Free City of Krak√≥w in 1835. It was subdivided into 30 groszy. The coins were minted in the Imperial Mint in Vienna. A history of the currency The Free City of Krak√≥w created in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna was granted the right to introduce its own currency but it chose to enter the monetary union with the Kingdom of Poland and did not implement the right to introduce its own currency until 1835.Tadeusz Ka≈Çkowski: TysiƒÖc lat monety polskiej, Krak√≥w 1974, p. 370. Between 1815 and 1835 the z≈Çoty of the Congress Kingdom of Poland was the official currency of the Free City of Krak√≥w. During the November Uprising also the z≈Çoty introduced by the revolutionary government in the Kingdom of Poland was in circulation in the Free City. Its obverse featured the crowned coat of arms consisting of the Polish White Eagle and Lithuanian Vytis, replacing earlier used Russian two-headed eagle with an escutcheon with the Polish White Eagle on its chest. Following the defeat of the Polish army in the November Uprising (1831), the Russian government decided to remove an effigy of the Polish eagle from the currency of the Congress Kingdom of Poland, replacing it with the Russian two-headed eagle. This move of the Russians made the government of the Free City of Krak√≥w to protest, under the pressure exercised by its own citizens who refused to accept the new coins, by introducing its own currency featuring the Polish White Eagle (which constituted a part of the arms of the Free City). The new currency was to circulate in Krak√≥w alongside the Polish z≈Çoty. In 1835 three coins of the new currency, the Krak√≥w z≈Çoty, were released into circulation in following denominations:Tadeusz Ka≈Çkowski: TysiƒÖc lat monety polskiej, Krak√≥w 1974, p. 371Czes≈Çaw Kami≈Ñski, Edmund Kopicki: Katalog monet polskich 1764-1864, KAW, Warszawa 1977, p. 142 * 5 groszy (silver, weight 1.45 g, mintage 180.000 pieces) * 10 groszy (silver, weight 2.90 g, mintage 150.000 pieces) * 1 z≈Çoty (silver, weight 3.30 g, mintage 20.000 pieces). Further two coins were supposed to be released later, namely 3 grosze (copper) and 2 z≈Çote (silver),Czes≈Çaw Kami≈Ñski, Edmund Kopicki: Katalog monet polskich 1764-1864, KAW, Warszawa 1977, p. 142-143 but the annexation of the Free City of Cracow by Austria in 1846 thwarted such plans. The Free City introduced only its own coins and continued to use the banknotes of the Congress Kingdom of Poland. The Krak√≥w z≈Çoty was equivalent to the Polish in the Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom, which had a fixed exchange rate to the Russian currencies of 1 kopeck = 2 grosze, or 0.15 ruble = 1 z≈Çoty. Following the annexation of Krak√≥w by Austria in 1846 the Krak√≥w z≈Çoty remained in circulation until the end of 1847 when it was replaced by Austro- Hungarian gulden. The exchange rate was 1 gulden=4 z≈Çote 12 groszy.Tadeusz Ka≈Çkowski: TysiƒÖc lat monety polskiej, Krak√≥w 1974, p. 371. Nowadays, due to a small number of coins minted and a relatively short circulation period (only twelve years), the Cracow z≈Çoty is an extremely rare collectible much coveted by collectors. The buying power of the Krak√≥w z≈Çoty can be illustrated by the following example taken from an 1845 carpenter's bill:Tadeusz Ka≈Çkowski: TysiƒÖc lat monety polskiej, Krak√≥w 1974, p. 371 * a table with a drawer - 18 z≈Ç. * 12 chairs - 175 z≈Ç. * a desk with two drawers - 48 z≈Ç. The design The author of the design remains unknown, but the coins were clearly styled on coins introduced in the Congress Kingdom of Poland by the revolutionary government in 1831 (see the picture). The obverse The obverse of all three coins is identical and features the crowned coat of arms of the Free City of Krak√≥w (the city gates wide open, topped with three towers and featuring the Polish White Eagle in the centre of the gate) with the name of the city-state in Polish placed above the coat of arms in semi-circle: WOLNE MIASTO KRAKOW.Czes≈Çaw Kami≈Ñski, Edmund Kopicki: Katalog monet polskich 1764-1864, KAW, Warszawa 1977, p. 142 The reverse The reverse follows an identical pattern differing only in size and the denomination. It features an oak wreath surrounding the denomination and the year (1835). For an earlier coin of Krak√≥w, issued in the 14th century, see Krak√≥w grosz.

The anchor stores are Forever 21, Dave & Buster's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Lord & Taylor (closing 2020), Macy's, JCPenney, Old Navy, Urban Air, Best Buy, DSW, and Kids For Less. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Sears. The mall is owned and managed by The Pyramid Companies of Syracuse, New York, the same management firm that developed it. History The Walden Galleria was developed by The Pyramid Companies, an Upstate New York-based shopping center development and management firm. Built on a site near Exit 52 of the New York State Thruway, the mall was opened in 1989. At the time, the mall featured six anchor stores: national chains JCPenney, and Sears, regional chain Bonwit Teller, and three Western New York chains: Sibley's, L. L. Berger, and The Sample. Sibley's opened in late 1988, several months before the rest of the mall. An additional anchor space was originally built for B. Altman and Company, but it remained vacant, as the chain decided not to open the Walden Galleria store due to credit restraints. At the time, the two-story mall also featured more than 150 stores, as well as a theater owned by Hoyts Cinemas. In 1990, Sibley's parent, May Co., merged operations with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Kaufmann's. That same year, local chain AM&A;'s (Adam, Meldrum & Anderson Company) moved from the nearby Thruway Mall into the space originally planned for B. Altman. The owner of the Thruway Mall sued the AM&A;'s chain, claiming breach of contract; the chain would later be declared liable for damages to the Thruway Mall, which was subsequently torn down and rebuilt as a strip mall in the early 1990s. Finally, Hoyts sold the Walden Galleria theater complex to General Cinemas by the end of the year. L. L. Berger declared bankruptcy in 1991, closing all of its stores. Later that same year, three more anchor stores were added to the mall: Lechmere, Loehmann's, and Lord & Taylor. The Sample closed in 1991, and was soon replaced with Linens & Wares, a household goods-based retailer; also, by the end of the year, Filene's Basement would open in the former L. L. Berger space. Both Filene's Basement and Loehmann's would close within three years. Mid-late 1990s In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based department store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM&A;'s chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo was struck by a dump truck while trying to get to her first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous. Dick's Sporting Goods at Walden Galleria, formerly a Galyan's sporting goods store. Montgomery Ward, which acquired the Lechmere chain in 1994, closed the last of the Lechmere stores nationwide in 1998, as part of a corporate restructuring. After its closure, half of the former Lechmere was then converted to a home store for JCPenney, while the other half sat vacant until DSW Shoe Warehouse replaced it in 1999. Linens 'n Wares, which closed at some point in the late 1990s, was converted to a home store for Kaufmann's in 1999 as well. One year later, a Galyan's Trading Company store was added onto the mall as well, with this store being renamed Dick's Sporting Goods in 2004 following the acquisition of the Galyan's chain. 2000s Starting in 2000, the first of several renovation plans was announced for the mall. The initial plan called for the addition of a new, three-story wing with an eighteen-screen movie theater complex, as well as several upscale tenants. Under this proposal, the existing Sears store would have been converted to mall space, and a new Sears store built immediately behind it. These expansion plans never came to fruition. By 2002, General Cinemas had sold the mall's theater complex to AMC Theatres. One year later, Pyramid made a failed attempt to evict the theaters for a Best Buy store, although Best Buy opened a store at the mall next to Sears in 2006. AMC closed the mall's theaters in 2004 and only four days after closing, the theater complex was acquired and reopened by Regal Entertainment Group. The JCPenney Home Store closed in 2002. Kaufmann's was one of several former May Co. brands to be acquired and renamed by Macy's in 2005, and while the main Kaufmann's store was converted to Macy's, the Home Store was shuttered. Also in 2006, The Bon-Ton closed. =2007 expansion= Walden Galleria concourse With the closure of The Bon-Ton in 2006, plans were once again announced to expand the Walden Galleria. Under these new plans, The Bon-Ton's former store was demolished for a concourse composed of more than of new retail space. The mall's existing theater complex, which was located next to The Bon-Ton, was also demolished for a newer, larger theater complex, which opened at the end of May 2008. On January 14, 2011, two new stores were announced to join the lineup at the Walden Galleria. It was announced in 2011 that Michael Kors would also open at the mall. Present-day Walden Galleria is the largest mall in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area, as well as the busiest, with more than 18 million shoppers annually, from both Canada and the United States. Its anchor stores as of 2017 are JCPenney, Macy's, and Lord & Taylor. In 2013, new Italian Marble floors, lounge areas and lighting fixtures were installed throughout the mall. The mall also offers a valet parking service. Currently the old main entrances are being updated to reflect the newer addition to the mall. Some of the mall's newer additions include RPM Raceway Indoor Go- Karting, lululemon, Microsoft, Free People and Texas De Brazil. In November 2014, the mall was involved in a controversy regarding stores being fined for deciding not to open on Thanksgiving Day. The mall owners threatened to fine stores $200 an hour if they remain closed on the holiday. On December 28, 2016, Sears announced that it would be closing as part of a plan to close 30 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2017.http://www.businessinsider.com/list-of-sears-and-kmart-stores- closing-2016-12 On August 2, 2020, it was announced that Lord & Taylor would be closing as part of a plan to close all 38 stores nationwide.

On 5 February 2009, the Government of Sweden announced an agreement allowing for the replacement of existing reactors, effectively ending the phase-out policy. History Electricity production in Sweden by type Nuclear power production in Sweden by reactor Sweden began research into nuclear energy in 1947 with the establishment of the Atomic Energy Company, which originated in the ongoing military research and development at the Defence Institute FOA.T. Jonter: Nuclear Weapon Research in Sweden. The Co-operation Between Civilian and Military Research, 1947-1972, SKI Report 02:18 In 1954, the country built its first small research heavy water reactor. It was followed by two heavy water reactors: √Ögesta, a small heat and power reactor in 1964, and Marviken which was finished but never operated, due to several safety issues.Jonter ibid On 1 May 1969, the prototype nuclear cogeneration plant √Ögestaverket (R3) suffered an incident in which secondary cooling water flooded through a broken valve and caused a number of electrical problems in the plant, resulting in a 4-day shutdown.The Flooding Incident at the √Ögesta Pressurized Heavy Water Nuclear Power Plant (pdf) R1, R3, and particularly the never finished R4 project at Marviken were heavy water reactors, motivated by the option to use Swedish uranium without isotope enrichment and by the possibility to use the reactors to produce weapons grade plutonium for Swedish nuclear warheads. The Swedish nuclear weapons program was eventually shut down, however, and Sweden signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1968.\\"Neutral Sweden Quietly Keeps Nuclear Option Open\\", The Washington Post, 25 November 1994 Six nuclear reactors began commercial service in the 1970s, another six through 1985. Nine of the reactors were designed by Allm√§nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA), three supplied by Westinghouse. After the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, there was a national referendum in Sweden about the future of nuclear power. As a result of this, the Riksdag decided in 1980 that no further nuclear power plants should be built, and that a nuclear power phase-out should be completed by 2010. Some observers have condemned the referendum as flawed because people could only vote \\"NO to nuclear\\", although three options were basically a harder or a softer \\"NO\\". After the 1986 Chernobyl accident in USSR, the question of security of nuclear energy was again raised. In July 1992 an incident at Barseb√§ck 2 showed that the five older boiling water reactors had had potentially reduced capacity in their emergency core cooling systems since they started operation. Mineral wool was dislodged and ended up in the suppression pool where it clogged the suction strainers.https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen- comm/bulletins/1996/bl96003.html It was classified as a grade 2 incident in the IAEA INES scale, due to the degradation of defence-in-depth. All five reactors were ordered down by the Nuclear Inspectorate for remedial action where backwash and additional strainers were installed. Most of the reactors were back in operation by next Spring, but Oskarshamn 1 remained down until January 1996 due to other work being carried out. During the late 1990s a unique capacity tax on nuclear power (effektskatten) was introduced. It was initially set at 5514 SEK per MWth per month, and only applied to nuclear power plants, thus penalizing them relative to other energy sources. In January 2006 it was almost doubled (at 10,200 SEK per MWth per month).http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country- profiles/countries-o-s/sweden.aspx An agreement struck in June 2016 among other things meant the capacity tax would be phased out by 2019. By then the tax constituted about one third of the cost of operating a nuclear reactor. In 1997 the Riksdag decided to shut down one of the reactors at Barseb√§ck by 1 July 1998 and the second before 1 July 2001, although under the condition that their energy production would be compensated. The next conservative government tried to cancel the phase-out, but, after protests, decided instead to extend the time limit to 2010. At Barseb√§ck, block 1 was shut down on 30 November 1999 and block 2 on 1 June 2005. In August 2006 three of Sweden's ten nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns following an incident at Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, in which two out of four emergency power generators failed causing a power shortage. It was classified as a grade 2 incident in the INES scale, due to the degradation of defence-in-depth. In 2006 the Centre Party of Sweden, an opposition party that supported the phase- out, announced that it was dropping its opposition to nuclear power, at least for the time being, claiming that it is unrealistic to expect the phase-out in the short term. It said it would now support the stance of the other opposition parties in Alliance for Sweden, which were considerably more pro- nuclear than the then Social Democratic government.Centre dumps nuclear deal , The Local, 30 May 2006 On 17 June 2010, the Riksdag adopted a decision allowing the replacement of the existing reactors with new nuclear reactors, starting from 1 January 2011. On 30 December 2019, Ringhals reactor 2 was shut down. List of reactorsPublic opinion The nuclear energy phase-out is controversial in Sweden. The energy production of the remaining nuclear power plants has been considerably increased in recent years to compensate for the Barseb√§ck shut-down. In May 2005, a poll of residents living around Barseb√§ck found that 94% wanted it to stay. The subsequent leak of radioactive water from the nuclear waste store in Forsmark did not lead to a major change in public opinion.Vindkraftverk m√∂ter st√∂rsta motst√•ndet i Sk√•ne , Sydsvenskan, 15 August 2005 According to a poll of January 2008, 48% of Swedes were in favour of building new nuclear reactors, 39% were opposed and 13% were undecided. However, the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan reversed prior support of nuclear power, with polls showing that 64% of Swedes opposed new reactors while 27% supported them.Swedes oppose new nuclear power: poll, The Local, 19 March 2011 However, in a poll November 2019 the public opinion has changed with 78 % in favor of nuclear power and only 11 % against.

Low- level waste is currently stored at the reactor sites or destroyed at Studsvik. The country has dedicated a ship, M/S Sigyn, to move waste from power plants to repositories. Sweden has also constructed a permanent underground repository, SFR, final repository for short-lived radioactive waste, with a capacity of 63,000 cubic meters for intermediate and low-level waste. A central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel, Clab, is located near Oskarshamn. The government has also identified two potential candidates for burial of additional waste (high-level), Oskarshamn and √ñsthammar. Anti- nuclear activists thumbEnvironmental activists in front of the Barseb√§ck nuclear power plant. These road signs were put up on roads around the power plant two weeks after the Chernobyl catastrophe. In June 2010, Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists invaded Forsmark nuclear power plant to protest the then-plan to remove the government prohibition on building new nuclear power plants. In October 2012, 20 Greenpeace activists scaled the outer perimeter fence of the Ringhals nuclear plant, and there was also an incursion of 50 activists at the Forsmark plant. Greenpeace said that its non-violent actions were protests against the continuing operation of these reactors, which it says are unsafe in European stress tests, and to emphasise that stress tests did nothing to prepare against threats from outside the plant. A report by the Swedish nuclear regulator said that \\"the current overall level of protection against sabotage is insufficient\\". Although Swedish nuclear power plants have security guards, the police are responsible for emergency response. The report criticised the level of cooperation between nuclear site staff and police in the case of sabotage or attack.

The band's name is a play on the Dire Straits song \\"Sultans of Swing\\", dating from a time when \\"it was sacrilege to say anything whatsoever funny or nasty about Dire Straits\\".Sultans of Ping interviewed on Rapido March 1992, viewed on YouTube April 2010  History  Following a number of line up changes, the band came to the attention of the Irish and UK music press, when \\"Where's Me Jumper\\" was released in January 1992. After several other independently released singles, the band signed to Epic Records, through a deal organised by Rhythm King Records's Martin Heath. With Epic, the band released their debut album Casual Sex In The Cineplex, and its follow up Teenage Drug, with additional tracks gaining a Japan-only release. Teenage Drug was renamed Teenage Planet Sexy War in Japan, and included the single \\"Michiko\\". Renaming themselves as The Sultans, they released their third album Good Year For Trouble in 1996. However, the album cover's artwork caused problems, as major record chains like HMV and Virgin decided that the display of bondage and S&M; was too explicit. By this time, Rhythm King had been absorbed into Arista Records, as Martin Heath became the head of the department. The record label released the band from their recording contract. Following a split in 1996, McCarthy joined the band Pharmacy, O'Flaherty was involved in producing the Japanese girl band Mika Bomb, while McFeely formed the rock and roll band, Sister, and later recruited former bassist with The Young Offenders, Steve Hackett. McCarthy moved to Stockholm where he taught English. Vocalist Niall O'Flaherty subsequently pursued a career in academia. The band reformed as The Sultans of Ping in 2005, and played a number of gigs with Jim Bob of Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine. In 2006, the group played a show with Radio 2's Mark Radcliffe, and his band The Family Mahone, as part of Manchester's yearly Irish Festival. That same year, the Sultans of Ping released their live DVD U Talk 2 Much: Live At The Cork Savoy Theatre on Cherry Red Records. The band played several gigs in 2007, at the Brixton Academy in London (with Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine), in Glasgow, and in Roscommon. They played a number of gigs in 2008, including Southend, London and Cork. Drummer Morty McCarthy has written a book on Cork slang entitled Dowtcha Boy. The title of the song \\"Give Him a Ball and a Yard of Grass\\", which appeared on their first album, about Nottingham Forest player Nigel Clough based on a quote from football manager Brian Clough about John Robertson. The song contains several more of his sayings in its lyrics. This was given away free with Nottingham Forest Fanzine 'Brian' as a one track flexi-disk in April 1992. The band were announced as the support act for Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine's 'Norf and Sarf' show at London's Brixton Academy in November 2011. In April 2015, the Sultans played a one off sold out gig at the Soundhouse, Leicester. Today, Niall O‚ÄôFlaherty is a lecturer in the History of European Political Thought at King's College London, specialising in 18th and 19th century thinkers such as Thomas Robert Malthus and Charles Darwin. Pat O‚ÄôConnell is in banking in London. Alan McFeely moved into film music. Morty McCarthy teaches English in Sweden.  Impact  \\"Where's Me Jumper\\" featured as the theme song to the Sky1 series of 2012, Moone Boy, and was the closing song in the Irish comedy of 2016, The Young Offenders. The band later explained that the song was based on a real incident in Nottingham hotspot The Black Orchid, however the item lost was in fact a cardigan. \\"Give Him a Ball and a Yard of Grass\\" is the theme song used by Irish national radio station Newstalk 106/108 on their 'Off The Ball' sports show.

Sidney Tarrow (1998) defines them as \\"a phase of heightened conflict across the social system\\", with \\"intensified interactions between challengers and authorities which can end in reform, repression and sometimes revolution\\". Tarrow argues that cyclical openings in political opportunity create incentives for collective action. Those cycles begin when the authority (like the government) becomes seen as vulnerable to social change, in a time when demands for social change are increasing. He defines the political opportunity as \\"consistent dimension of the political environment that provides incentives for people to undertake collective action by affecting their expectations of success or failure\\". When the political opportunity disappears, for example because of a change in the public opinion caused by a rise in insecurity and violence, the movement dissolves. Tarrow lists the qualities of a cycle of contention: * a rapid diffusion of collective action and mobilization as existing social movements create political opportunities for others to act or join in; * innovation in the forms of contention; * the creation or major change in collective action frames, discourses and frames of meaning; * coexistence of organized and unorganized activists; * increased interaction between challengers and authorities. Tarrow (1998) notes that \\"such widespread contention produces externalities that give challengers at least a temporary advantage and allows them to overcome the weaknesses in their resource base. It demands that states devise broad strategies of response that are either repressive or facilitative, or a combination of the two.\\" He writes that even defeated or suppressed movements leave some kind of residue behind them, and that effect of social movements, successful or failed, is cumulative in the long term, leading to new protest cycles. This is visible especially when those cycles are analysed in the historical frame. Prior to the 18th century, rebellions were usually aimed at local targets in response to local grievances, usually without many preparations and without allies in different social or ethnic groups. This has however changed in the 18th century, when social movements evolved in West Europe and North America (see also works by Charles Tilly).

The Villa Medici, founded by Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and now property of the French State, has housed the French Academy in Rome since 1803. A musical evocation of its garden fountains features in Ottorino Respighi's Fontane di Roma.  History  In ancient times, the site of the Villa Medici was part of the gardens of Lucullus, which passed into the hands of the Imperial family with Messalina, who was murdered in the villa. In 1564, when the nephews of Cardinal Giovanni Ricci of Montepulciano acquired the property, it had long been abandoned to viticulture. The sole dwelling was the Casina of Cardinale Marcello Crescenzi, who had maintained a vineyard here and had begun improvements to the villa under the direction of the Florentine Nanni Lippi, who had died however, before work had proceeded far. The new proprietors commissioned Annibale Lippi, the late architect's son, to continue work. Interventions by Michelangelo are a tradition. In 1576, the property was acquired by Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici, who finished the structure to designs by Bartolomeo Ammanati. The Villa Medici became at once the first among Medici properties in Rome, intended to give concrete expression to the ascendancy of the Medici among Italian princes and assert their permanent presence in Rome. Under the Cardinal's insistence, Ammanati incorporated into the design Roman bas-reliefs and statues that were coming to sight with almost every spadeful of earth, with the result that the facades of the Villa Medici, as it now was, became a virtual open-air museum. A series of grand gardens recalled the botanical gardens created at Pisa and at Florence by the Cardinal's father Cosimo I de' Medici, sheltered in plantations of pines, cypresses and oaks. Ferdinando de' Medici had a studiolo, a retreat for study and contemplation, built to the north east of the garden above the Aurelian wall. Now these rooms look onto Borghese gardens but would then have had views over the Roman countryside. These two rooms were only uncovered in 1985 by the restorer Geraldine Albers: the concealing whitewash had protected and conserved the superb fresco decoration carried out by Jacopo Zucchi 1576 and 1577. The villa's Loggia dei leoni, including copies of the original Medici lions Among the striking assemblage of Roman sculptures in the villa were some one hundred seventy pieces bought from two Roman collections that had come together through marriage, the Capranica and the della Valle collections.Haskell and Penny 1981:24 and note. An engraving detailing the arrangement of statues prior to 1562 was documented by Galassi Alghisi.* Galassi Alghisii Carpens., apud Alphonsum II. Ferrariae Ducem architecti, opus, By Galasso Alghisi, Dominicus Thebaldius (1563), page 27-28 in Googlebooks PDF version Three works that arrived at the Villa Medici under Cardinal Fernando, ranked with the most famous in the city: the Niobe Group and the Wrestlers, both discovered in 1583 and immediately purchased by Cardinal Ferdinando, and the Arrotino. When the Cardinal succeeded as Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1587, his elder brother having died, he satisfied himself with plaster copies of his Niobe Group, in full knowledge of the prestige that accrued to the Medici by keeping such a magnificent collection in the European city whose significance far surpassed that of their own capital.Haskell and Penny 1981:55. The Medici lions were completed in 1598, and the Medici Vase entered the collection at the Villa, followed by the Venus de' Medici by the 1630s; the Medici sculptures were not removed to Florence until the eighteenth century. Then the antiquities from the Villa Medici formed the nucleus of the collection of antiquities in the Uffizi, and Florence began to figure on the European Grand Tour.The fountain in 2002 The fountain in the front of the Villa Medici is formed from a red granite vase from ancient Rome. It was designed by Annibale Lippi in 1589. The view from the Villa looking over the fountain towards St Peter's in the distance has been much painted, but the trees in the foreground have now obscured the view.Alta Macadam, Rome (6th edition 1998)) p.172. Like the Villa Borghese that adjoins them, the villa's gardens were far more accessible than the formal palaces such as Palazzo Farnese in the heart of the city. For a century and a half the Villa Medici was one of the most elegant and worldly settings in Rome, the seat of the Grand Dukes' embassy to the Holy See. When the male line of the Medici died out in 1737, the villa passed to the house of Lorraine and, briefly in Napoleonic times, to the Kingdom of Etruria. In this manner Napoleon Bonaparte came into possession of the Villa Medici, which he transferred to the French Academy at Rome. Subsequently, it housed the winners of the prestigious Prix de Rome, under distinguished directors including Ingres and Balthus, until the prize was withdrawn in 1968. In 1656, Christina, Queen of Sweden was said to have fired one of the cannon on top of the Castel Sant'Angelo without aiming it first. The wayward ball hit the villa, destroying one of the Florentine lilies that decorated the facade.  French Academy in Rome  Portrait by Ingres of fellow student Merry-Joseph Blondel in front of the Villa in 1809. In 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte moved the French Academy in Rome to the Villa Medici with the intention of preserving an institution once threatened by the French Revolution. At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state, and they had to be renovated in order to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. In this way, he hoped to retain for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of antiquity and the Renaissance. The young architect Auguste-Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny undertook the renovation. The competition was interrupted during the first World War, and Benito Mussolini confiscated the villa in 1941, forcing the Academy of France in Rome to withdraw until 1945. The competition and the Prix de Rome were eliminated in 1968 by Andr√© Malraux. The Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Institut de France then lost their guardianship of the Villa Medici to the Ministry of Culture and the French State. From that time on, the boarders no longer belonged solely to the traditional disciplines (painting, sculpture, architecture, metal-engraving, precious-stone engraving, musical composition, etc.) but also to new or previously neglected artistic fields (art history, archaeology, literature, stagecraft, photography, movies, video, art restoration, writing and even cookery.) Artists are no longer recruited by a competition but by application, and their stays generally vary from six to eighteen months. Between 1961 and 1967, the artist Balthus, then at the head of the Academy, carried out a vast restoration campaign of the palace and its gardens, providing them with modern equipment. Balthus participated ‚Äúhands on‚Äù in all the phases of the construction. Where the historic d√©cor had disappeared, Balthus proposed personal alternatives. He invented a d√©cor that was a homage to the past and, at the same time, radically contemporary: The mysterious melancholic decor he created for Villa Medici has become, in turn, historic and was undergoing an important restoration campaign in 2016. Work continued under the direction of the previous director, Richard Peduzzi, and the Villa Medici resumed organizing exhibitions and shows created by its artists in residence. The Academy continues its programme of inviting young artists, who receive a stipend to spend twelve months in Rome, exhibiting their work. These artists- in-residence are known as pensionnaires. The French word ‚Äòpension‚Äô refers to the room & board these, generally young and promising, artists receive. The Villa Medici hosts a number of guest rooms, and when these are not used by pensionnaires or other official guests, they are open to the general public.  Architectural influence  Marble copy by Augustin Pajou of one of the Medici Lions at the Villa Several structures base their style on the villa. Architect Edward Lippincott Tilton designed the Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, in 1893. Philanthropist James H. Dooley had a mansion called Swannanoa built on Rockfish Gap, Virginia, in 1912. The NYC architectural firm, Schultze and Weaver, modeled the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida after the Villa for the hotel's second reconstruction, which took place between 1925 and 1926. The marble Medici lions by the stairs to the courtyard served as inspiration for Bernard Foucquet's bronze lions at the Lejonbacken (lion slope) on the northern side of the Royal Palace in Stockholm in 1700‚Äì1704.

On 15 February 2015, Rahimi was convicted of corruption and is currently jailed in Evin Prison. He was allegedly head of the \\"Fatemi Circle\\". Early life and education Rahimi was born into a Kurdish Shiite family on 11 January 1949 in a village, Serishabad, in Iran's Kurdistan province. He received a law degree from Tehran University. Rahimi also claims to hold a PhD from Oxford University but no record of his name has been found in the university and also this claim has been vastly disputed by many Iranian sources.ÿßŸÑŸÅ ‚Äì ÿ±ÿ≠ŸäŸÖ€å ŸÖÿπÿßŸàŸÜ ÿßŸàŸÑ ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ€å‚ÄåŸÜ⁄òÿßÿØ ÿ¥ÿØ Alef Rahimi is considered to be the second high-ranking member of Ahmadinejad's administration to have lied about receiving a PhD from Oxford University, the other being Ali Kordan. He has also claimed to have a PhD from Belford University, characterized as \\"just one of hundreds of diploma mills easily accessible online.\\" Alef, an Iranian site that belongs to Ahmad Tavakkoli, published documents purporting to show fraudulent documents created by Rahimi. Career Rahimi worked as a public prosecutor in Qorveh and Sanandaj. He headed the city council of Sanandaj, too. During this period, he taught law at the school of law at Tehran Azad University and served as head of the school for a short time. Rahimi was elected as member of the Parliament of Iran from his province of birth Kurdistan in Legislative election of 1980 as a member of Islamic Republican Party. He was in Parliament until 1992 when he resigned from his seat. He held many positions when he was an MP such as head of arts commission and a member of foreign policy commission. Then he was appointed governor of the Kurdistan Province in August 1993 by then-president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and was in office until August 1997 when Mohammad Khatami was elected as new president and named new governors. Rahimi was not in Khatami's list of governors. During his governorship, he firstly met Mahmoud Ahmedinejad. Ahmadinejad named Rahimi as his vice president for legal and parliamentary affairs in 2008. He was appointed as the 5th first vice president of Iran on 13 September 2009 in a declaration by the president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and succeeded Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei who was in office for a short time. He was acting president of Iran from 20 April 2011 to 1 May 2011 when president Ahmadinejad boycotted his official duties. He run for the presidency of Iran in the 2013 elections, but withdrew his candidacy in May 2013. After the election of Hassan Rouhani as the president, his term ended as first vice president. Corruption charges Based on the claims of at least two members of the Iranian Parliament (Majlis), Rahimi was the head of a corruption band that became known as Fatemi Circle. This circle had an office in Fatemi street in Tehran. Naderan, a member of Majlis who is close to Ahmad Tavakkoli, has criticized the judicial system for not arresting him. Motahari, another member of Majlis, has asked Ahmadinejad to cooperate with judicial system on this issue and called the accusations serious. In January 2015, Iran's judiciary announced that Rahimi has been sentenced to 5 years in prison and an equivalent of $1 million fine. =Indictment= On 1 September 2014, Rahimi was sentenced to a prison term and a cash fine, convicted of yet unknown charges. The sentence needs to be finalized by a Court of Appeal for details of the indictment to be revealed. On 21 January 2015, Iran's supreme court sentenced Rahimi to five years and 91 days in prison and fined him to pay 10 billion rials. Rahimi was also ordered to pay a compensation equivalent to 28.5 billion rials. Statements on Jews and illegal drugs At an international anti-drug conference held in Tehran with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on 26 June 2012, Rahimi delivered an antisemitic speech, at which at least 10 Western diplomats were present, blaming the Talmud for the spread of illegal drugs worldwide. Rahimi stated that the Talmud teaches \\"how to destroy non-Jews so as to protect an embryo in the womb of a Jewish mother\\" and that \\"Zionists\\" are in control of the illegal drug trade. He stated his \\"proof\\" is that there is not \\"one single Zionist who is an addict.\\" The New York Times, which covered the conference marking a U.N.-sponsored International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, further quoted Rahimi as saying Zionists ordered gynaecologists to kill black babies and that the Russian Revolution of 1917 was started by Jews ‚Äì although none, he was also quoted as saying, died in it.Iranian VP blames ‚ÄòZionists‚Äô for illicilt drug trade , Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), 27 June 2012.Israel accuses Iran of anti-Semitism after drug speech by Dan Williams, Reuters, 27 June 2012.VP Blames Zionists, Talmud for Growing Drug Trade in World , Fars News Agency, 26 June 2012 (News number: 9103083782).Iranian VP: Zionists, Talmud behind the international illicit drug trade by Natasha Mozgovaya, Haaretz, 27 June 2012. Rahimi's statements, which subsequently appeared on the official presidential website, were also broadcast by the Fars News Agency.Top Iranian official‚Äôs anti-Semitic remarks draw condemnation from Canada by Paul Koring, The Globe and Mail, 29 June 2012. =Responses= Rahimi's remarks drew sharp criticism from the international community. Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, stated that \\"Here is yet another example of the fact that anti-Semitism is a pillar of the Mullahocracy in Tehran...on a day when nations are supposed to set aside their differences to combat illegal drugs, the Iranian government continues to malign the Jewish people and its religious traditions ‚Äì all part of their ongoing campaign of demonizing the Jewish people and dehumanizing supporters of the Jewish state.\\"Tehran's Newest Anti-Semitic Rant: Zionists and The Talmud Use Global Drug Trafficking to Destroy Non-Jews, Simon Wiesenthal Center, 26 June 2012. Abe Foxman, the National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, stated that \\"To all those who thought that anti-Semitism is a thing of the past, certainly this makes it very clear that it is alive and well again. What makes it more sinister and dangerous is the fact that it comes from a leader of a country that has vowed to destroy the Jewish state and is making efforts to obtain the means to do it.\\"Alan Dershowitz: Iran Declares War Against the Jewish People Alan M. Dershowitz, Jewish Press, 28 June 2012. John Baird, Canada's Foreign Minister condemned the remarks, stating that \\"Iran's ongoing use of UN forums to harass Israel and insult Jewish people around the world is completely unacceptable. Canada hopes the international community joins us in speaking out against, and utterly rejecting, such ridiculous and anti-Semitic assertions.\\" The European Union's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who leads nuclear talks with Iran on behalf of six world powers, released a statement, stating that she \\"is deeply disturbed by racist and anti-Semitic statements made by Iranian First Vice-President Mohammad Reza Rahimi. Such statements are unacceptable and should not be tolerated.\\" Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi also condemned Rahimi's remarks, calling them \\"Disturbing and absolutely unacceptable.\\"International officials ask Iran to refrain from anti-Semitic statements Michael Astor, The Associated Press (republished in The Gazette (Montreal)) 28 June 2012. Alistair Burt, the British foreign minister for the Middle East, stated that \\"We condemn utterly the baseless comments from Iran's vice president Rahimi about the Talmud and the Jewish faith, made at a United Nations drugs control event in Tehran this week. Racism and anti-semitism are unacceptable in any circumstance, let alone at an event sponsored by the United Nations. We call upon Iran to correct this scandalous statement, and to ensure that its officials respect the proper international norms and standards in the future.\\"UK condemns Iranian vice president for anti-semitic remarks, The Guardian, 28 June 2012.Iran's Vice- President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi Remarks Condemned As 'Anti-Semitic', HuffPost, 28 June 2012. Alun Jones, spokesman for the Vienna-based United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, later stated that UNODC attended the Tehran conference as well as related events across the world on Tuesday, as mandated by the U.N. General Assembly, and that it could not anticipate what the Iranian hosts would say. Affiliation Rahimi reportedly \\"professed\\" allegiance to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani when he served in his administration, despite the fact he later became his \\"outspoken foe\\". Naghmeh Sohrabi, a professor at Brandeis University, classifies Rahimi among \\"new guard\\" conservatives which came to mainstream political arena in 2005. She names Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi and Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei among the prominent figures of the faction. He was a member of the committee composed of 15 figures from different spectrum of conservative factions that planned establishment of the United Front of Principlists in 2008 elections. In November 2010, Rahimi was among 30 figures invited to a similar meeting of conservatives for 2012 parliamentary elections, although he did not attend.

In this episode, Michael's (Steve Carell) controversial imitation of a Chris Rock routine forces the staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar. A consultant (Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge‚Äîaggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff‚Äîand creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing tempers to slowly simmer until they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep hold of a lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself. \\"Diversity Day\\" was the first episode of The Office to feature original writing, as the pilot episode (\\"Pilot\\") contained many jokes from the British series pilot. The episode guest-starred Larry Wilmore, who plays the sensitivity trainer Mr. Brown. Wilmore, a writer for the show, had to formally audition with other actors because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild. The episode received a 2.7/6 in the Nielsen ratings among people aged 18‚Äì49 garnered 6.0 million viewers overall, losing almost half of its audience from the previous week. Despite this setback, the episode received positive reviews from television critics. Plot In answer to Michael‚Äôs (Steve Carell) apparently constant recitation of Chris Rock's \\"Niggas Vs. Black People\\" routine, the corporate offices of Dunder Mifflin send a representative (Larry Wilmore) from Diversity Today to hold a meeting regarding diversity training. Michael finds it insulting and, as a response, holds his own diversity meeting. He shows a brief video that addresses nothing of significance, claims that his heritage is \\"two-fifteenths Native American,\\" and instructs everyone to wear index cards with a certain race on it and to treat others however they might treat people of those races. When he delivers a racist impression of an Indian person to Kelly (Mindy Kaling), she takes offense and slaps him. Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) desperately tries to re-up an annual sale that will amount to a quarter of his yearly commission, but he is ultimately undercut by Dwight (Rainn Wilson). However, during the end of the diversity meeting Pam (Jenna Fischer) dozes on his shoulder, leading Jim to conclude that it was nevertheless \\"not a bad day\\". Production The episode guest-starred Larry Wilmore as Mr. Brown. Larry Wilmore, who plays the sensitivity trainer Mr. Brown, is a writer for the show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in.

Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on-screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes. The second episode of the series was the first to feature predominantly original writing, as the pilot episode contained many jokes from the British series pilot. During one of Michael's impersonations, a racial expletive spoken by Michael had to be censored by the producers for NBC. Daniels was terrified that the scene would leak unedited, so he personally oversaw the censoring of the master copy.Daniels, Greg (Executive Producer). 2005. \\"Diversity Day\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season One (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. The scene where Pam rests her head on Jim's shoulder after Dwight has stolen his sale and Jim smiles and says \\"not a bad day after all\\" came about when Greg Daniels spoke to the writers about wanting to have small, happy interactions between Jim and Pam and mentioned the head-on-shoulder idea, which B. J. Novak immediately wrote into his script. Paul Lieberstein did not want to appear in the episode and did so assuming it would be a one- time event, but Kevin Reilly was impressed by his work and said the show should use him more, leading to the expansion of Paul's work as Toby Flenderson. Two scenes that were cut involved Michael Scott responding to Mr. Brown's \\"HERO\\" acronym by creating one that sounded good until everyone noticed the words created the acronym of \\"INCEST\\", and Michael responded to Mr. Brown's nixing of that idea by pointing out the links between incest and racism in some states, while another had Jim replacing Dwight's \\"Asian\\" headband with \\"Dwight\\" and then having the other co-workers complain to a clueless Dwight about how annoying his behavior was. Web release NBC webcast this episode on March 16, 2005, on MySpace to promote the show's then- upcoming premiere. This was NBC's first-ever online debut of a complete episode of a network series, and also included a trimmed-down webisode version of the episode for on-demand viewing on MySpace the following day. Greg Daniels later noted in an interview with Uproxx that cutting it to the required 12 minute \\"was almost impossible\\" and that he had already \\"really sweated\\" during the process of getting the episode down the 22 minutes for broadcast. Reception=Ratings \\"Diversity Day\\" premiered on NBC on March 29, 2005. While the pilot episode garnered over eleven million viewers, the second episode lost over half its viewing audience from the previous episode. The episode received a 2.7/6 in the Nielsen ratings among people aged 18‚Äì49, meaning that 2.7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds viewed the episode and six percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching TV viewed it. The episode garnered 6.0 million viewers overall. Alt URL The episode, airing after Scrubs, retained 90% of its lead-in 18‚Äì49 audience. In addition, \\"Diversity Day,\\" along with the other first season episodes of The Office helped NBC score its highest-rated Tuesday night slot since February 1, 2005. Reviews Contrary to the lukewarm response to the pilot, \\"Diversity Day\\" earned positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode positive reviews, stating that: \\"Think of the toss-off racism of the original, plopped into a PC-gone-wrong showcase that might be entitled The Accidental Bigot. As when the African-American diversity trainer introduces himself as Mr. Brown, and Scott assures him, 'I will not call you that.'\\" Ricky Gervais (the lead in the British series) stated that in comparison to the British version, \\"[i]t is as good. I love the fact that, apart from the first one, the scripts are all original. You've gone back to the blueprint of what the characters are and you've started from there, as opposed to copying anything.\\" Rolling Stone magazine named the scene wherein Michael shows the office his diversity video the third greatest Moment from The Office. The article particularly praised Michael's line: \\"Abraham Lincoln once said, 'If you are a racist, I will attack you with the North. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\" and felt that, as the show lost viewers in the first season, the stories got better, and that \\"Diversity Day\\" is an excellent example of this \\"unfortunate trend\\". He noted that the episode \\"would go on to be one of the series‚Äô defining episodes, an installment that put a more hopeful spin on the original Offices views on accepting the disparity between our dreams and our realities.\\" However, Adams noted that Carell's character was still too aggressive for Michael Scott to be completely lovable, and that the second season episode \\"Sexual Harassment\\" would serve as \\"a gentler spiritual sequel\\" to this episode, featuring a similar premise, but with a softened Michael Scott. For his work on this episode, B. J. Novak was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay ‚Äì Episodic Comedy.

Count Adolf IV of Schauenburg and Holstein ‚Äî leading an army consisting of troops from the cities of L√ºbeck and Hamburg, about 1000 Dithmarsians and combined troops of Holstein next to various Northern German nobles ‚Äî defeated King Valdemar II of Denmark and the Welf Otto the Child.  Background  Valdemar and his predecessor King Canute VI of Denmark had previously conquered Holstein, Mecklenburg, Hamburg, L√ºbeck (1202), Ratzeburg and the coast of Pomerania including the island of R√ºgen.  The battle  The contest was maintained with great firmness on both sides, and continued for an unusual length of time, and the carnage was so great, that its combatants are said to have fought knee deep in blood. The King of Denmark had one of his eyes shot out, and had several horses killed under him, but his troops and their allies fought with so much bravery that the victory would have been theirs had not the contingent of Dithmarschen, a Saxon ethnic group, deserted their colours. At the most critical moment of the action these troops passed over to the enemy, and the Danes were obliged to give way. In the confusion that followed Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and the Bishop of Ribe were taken prisoner. Otto was sent to Rostock, the capital of a lordship held by Mecklenburg, where he was shut up in a fortress. But the King of Denmark, who escaped from the field, busied himself in repairing this disaster by forming a fresh army, with which he kept the enemy in check.  Results  As a result of the battle, the Danish border with the Holy Roman Empire was moved north again from river Elbe to the Eider River, the southern border of the Duchy of Schleswig. This border remained in effect until 1806. The victorious Adolf IV of Schauenburg regained the County of Holstein and his fellow victor Albert I, Duke of Saxony reasserted himself as liege lord of the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein against the Welf claim.Cordula Bornefeld, \\"Die Herz√∂ge von Sachsen-Lauenburg\\", in: Die F√ºrsten des Landes: Herz√∂ge und Grafen von Schleswig, Holstein und Lauenburg [De slevigske hertuger; German], Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen (ed.) on behalf of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Schleswig- Holsteinische Geschichte, Neum√ºnster: Wachholtz, 2008, pp. 373-389, here pp. 373seq. Dithmarschen shook off Danish supremacy and returned to a very loose overlordship by the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, paving the way for its de facto autonomy as a peasant republic until 1559. The Principality of R√ºgen was the only possession in the Holy Roman Empire left to Valdemar after the battle.  References  * Sir Andrew Halliday Annals of the House of Hannover, v.2, London, 1826.

Written by Paul Lieberstein, who also acts in the show as Toby Flenderson, and directed by Ken Whittingham, the episode first aired in the United States on April 5, 2005, on NBC. In this episode, Michael (Steve Carell) is tasked with choosing a new and inexpensive health care plan. He immediately hands it off to enthusiastic volunteer Dwight (Rainn Wilson). Dwight ruthlessly cuts nearly all benefits in the new plan, angering the rest of the office staff. Meanwhile, Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim (John Krasinski) make up fake diseases, much to Dwight's chagrin. In an attempt to appease them, Michael promises the entire office a surprise and then spends the rest of the day scrambling to come through with his promise. The employees wait for Michael's surprise, which he awkwardly never delivers. The episode received positive reviews from television critics. Jenna Fischer later called \\"Health Care\\" her favorite season one episode. During one particular scene, Rainn Wilson kept improvising new fake diseases. The laughter that resulted in his ad-libs was not scripted, as they were in fact the cast's genuine reaction to Wilson's fake diseases. The episode received a 2.9/7 in the Nielsen ratings among people aged 18‚Äì49 garnered 5.8 million viewers overall. In addition, the episode retained 100% of its lead-in 18‚Äì49 audience and ranked, along with the other first-season episodes of The Office, as NBC's highest-rated Tuesday night program since February 1, 2005. Plot Jan Levinson-Gould (Melora Hardin) tasks Michael Scott (Steve Carell) with picking a new healthcare plan for the office, dictating that he must choose a provider and simply pick the cheapest plan. Unwilling to reveal the bad news that healthcare benefits will likely be cut to the employees, Michael at first tasks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) with handling the healthcare decision, but Jim instead recommends Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who eagerly accepts the assignment. To work on the plan, Michael allows Dwight to use the conference room as a temporary workspace, though Dwight lets the power go to his head and refers to his workspace as an office. Dwight picks a very cheap plan with little coverage, no benefits, and a large deductible. Not willing to confront the disgruntled employees, Michael hides out in his office claiming he is very busy. When the other employees confront him about Dwight's bad plan, he chastises Dwight and tries to liven the employees' spirits by telling them he has a big surprise prepared for them at the end of the day, though even he isn't sure what the surprise will be. In another desperate attempt to avoid questions, Michael leaves the office and tries to plan the surprise. Back at the office, Dwight distributes forms that ask employees to list any ailments or illnesses they may have so that it may be covered. Jim and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) conjure up fake diseases that frustrate Dwight. Jim later locks Dwight in his \\"workspace\\" as Michael, having failed to procure a better surprise, returns with ice cream sandwiches. While trapped in the conference room, Dwight calls Jan, attempting to get Jim fired, but Jan is not only outraged that Michael left the office and left Dwight in charge, but also that he handed off the healthcare plan duties to him. Dwight later gathers the employees in the conference room, forcing them to publicly reveal their ailments. At the end of the day, the employees confront Michael to hear about the surprise, but Michael's awkward stalling tactics cause them to finally realize there is no surprise, and they leave. With only him and Dwight left in the office, Dwight casually mentions to Michael what Jan said to him. Production In an interview with TV Guide, Jenna Fischer called \\"Health Care\\" her favorite episode of season one. \\"Health Care\\" marked the first episode written by writer/actor Paul Lieberstein, who would go on to write several other episodes. It also marked the first episode directed by Ken Whittingham, who would go on to direct several other episodes. Jenna Fischer stated that \\"Health Care\\" was her favorite episode of season one. Fischer went on to say that \\"We laughed a lot while making this episode. Particularly during the scene where Dwight confronts everyone in the office about who has been writing fake diseases on their health forms. Rainn Wilson kept improvising new fake diseases, and we didn't know what he would say next.\\" Fischer notes that several of the scenes that involved laughing were not scripted and were in fact the casts genuine reaction to Wilson's fake diseases. The episode was rebroadcast on March 29, 2007, as part of a \\"Human resources Nightmares\\" marathon hosted by Paul Lieberstein.

Reviews Critical reception to \\"Health Care\\" was largely positive. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\", and felt that the episode helped to expand upon Dwight's character, noting that \\"the pieces are falling into place\\" for Dwight to become the show's breakout character. Furthermore, he applauded the fact that the episode was based on an episode of the original BBC series, but that it did not create an exact copy, but rather used the concept as a template to create something new and original. In a review by DVD Verdict, Mike Pinsky stated that \\"Turning the third episode over to such a character, when Michael passes off responsibility for picking a corporate health care plan to Dwight, is meant to draw laughs out of his megalomania. But it just is not that funny.\\" Travis Fickett from IGN wrote positively of the episode, giving it a 7.9/10 \\"good\\" rating. He noted that \\"there's something Stephen King about Dwight that creates an underlying layer of menace\\" and that the episode is \\"an early incarnation of [The Office's] early days, its original \\"paradigm\\" ‚Äì and arguably its strongest.\\" IGN later placed Jim and Pam's prank of creating fake diseases as ninth in its \\"Top Ten Moments from The Office\\".

The episode aired on NBC in the United States on April 12, 2005. It was written by Michael Schur and directed by Bryan Gordon, marking their first credits for the show. In this episode, paranoia takes over the members of the office as downsizing rumors swirl. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) forms a Survivor-esque alliance with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) against the other employees‚Äîlater adding Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) also. Meanwhile, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arranges a morale- boosting birthday party for Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery)‚Äîalthough her birthday is more than a month away. Michael agonizes over writing the perfect greeting in her birthday card, and in the end, his joke falls flat, ruining the party. The episode was inspired by popular reality television shows, most notably Survivor. Originally, the first cut of the episode ran 37 minutes long and the producers considered making the episode a two-parter, one focusing on the Alliance and another focusing on Meredith's birthday party, but later decided against the idea. In addition, several of the lines and scenes from the episode were improvised or ad-libbed by the cast. \\"The Alliance\\" was viewed by an estimated 5.4 million viewers and received a 2.4/6% rating share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Plot Although time has dragged on, the downsizing rumors at Dunder Mifflin have not ceased. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) feels particularly threatened by the impending crisis, and, in an act of desperation, forms an alliance with his office nemesis Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). Jim sees the alliance as an opportunity with great potential and agrees as a lark. He immediately enlists Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer)'s help in the situation. The two continue to perform a series of office pranks at the expense of Dwight. Meanwhile, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) tries to boost morale in the office by having an office birthday party for Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery), even though her birthday is a month away. Michael agonizes over writing the perfect greeting in her birthday card. In the end, his joke (and subsequent rejected ones) fall flat and ruins the party. At the same time, Oscar also gets him to donate money to his nephew's cerebral palsy walk- a-thon, which Michael accidentally overcontributes to in an effort to look like a good boss. At the end of the day, after a breakthrough in his pranks on Dwight, Jim giddily grabs Pam's hand in an attempt to explain what has just happened. However, Pam's fianc√© Roy Anderson (David Denman) catches this and sees it as an attempt by Jim to make a move on Pam. Jim tries to convince Roy that it was just \\"office pranks\\" and asks Dwight to back him up, but he simply denies any involvement leaving Jim awkwardly embarrassed. Dwight reveals that he had no problems betraying Jim, despite the fact that he recently fell into one of Jim's tricks. Production Randall Einhorn, a former Survivor crew member, shot the episode. The episode was inspired by popular reality television shows, most notably Survivor. The \\"Can I trust Jim ...\\" line was a direct reference to the show and was a \\"last-second addition\\" according to Daniels. In addition, Randall Einhorn, the cameraman for the episode, was a cameraman for Survivor. When the episode was being written, many of the cast and crew feared that it would bear too many stylistic resemblances to Curb Your Enthusiasm. Daniels later defended the show, saying that the show was different because of \\"the fact that they are on TV and they know they are being filmed. [They know they're] on camera.\\" During the writing of the episode, Daniels made the writers spend actual time on the set, most notably in Michael's office. Mindy Kaling later noted that she \\"hated it.\\" The first cut of the episode ran 37 minutes long and the producers were tasked with cutting the footage down to 22 minutes. Executive producer Greg Daniels considered making the episode a two-parter, one focusing on the Alliance and another focusing on Meredith's birthday party, but the appearance of party hats in the Alliance-only scenes caused him to nix this idea.Daniels, Greg (Producer). 2005. \\"The Alliance\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season One (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. Because the episode had to be cut down due to time, several scenes were drastically cut.

The final scene where Roy confronts Jim was shot ten different times, each in a different style, ranging from Roy slamming Jim into the wall to Roy asking Jim, \\"Hey, what are you doing?\\" Although the crew felt that the wall-slamming version was more dramatic, they realized that it caused the episode to go from a comedy to an \\"angry drama.\\" Several of the lines and scenes from the episode were improvised or ad-libbed by the cast. Jenna Fischer named the party planning scene her favorite scene and called it \\"longest most horrible meeting of all time\\". On the commentary track for the episode, Fischer revealed that the scene was almost entirely ad- libbed.Fischer, Jenna (Actor). 2005. \\"The Alliance\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season One (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal.

Wilmore later said of ab-libs, \\"part of the fun in writing a show like this is trying to write lines that sound like ad-libs.\\" Daniels also praised the episode's lines, saying, \\"when you know the acting is really good, it all sounds like it's been improvised.\\" The scenes where Dwight climbs into a box almost did not make the episode. Mike Schur, who wrote the episode, feared that Dwight climbing into the box would not only make the episode \\"crazy broad,\\" but also make the rest of the episode look boring by comparison. After shooting the scene, however, he described it as \\"the most natural thing in the world.\\" Phil Shaw, the stunt man for The Office, did most of the work in the box. Schur described Dwight's emergence from the box as his \\"action hero\\" moment. Daniels likened the scene to the movie Alien. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on 12 April 2005, \\"The Alliance\\" was viewed by an estimated 5.4 million viewers and received a 2.4/6% rating share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Alt URL This means that it was seen by 2.4% of all 18‚Äì49 year-olds, and 6% of all 18‚Äì49 year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode, airing after Scrubs, retained 100% of its lead-in 18‚Äì49 audience for the second week in a row. Reviews The episode received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the developing relationship between Pam and Jim. Travis Fickett from IGN praised the episode and compared Jim and Pam's relationship in the first season to that of the fourth, saying, \\"Jim and Pam simply work better before they were a couple. The fact that Roy can come between them here is fun ‚Äì and reminds us that it was more interesting when something could still come between them!\\" In summary, he concluded that, \\"['The Alliance'] is one of the better early episodes of the show, and going out with Dwight talking to the camera ‚Äì his hair dyed blonde ‚Äì is genius and gives us (up to this point) the most perfect 'Dwight' moment of the show so far.\\" Television critic Robin Pierson noted that in the episode, \\"The Jim and Pam relationship begins to take real shape here.\\" He later called the moment when Roy nearly attacks Jim as \\"a much more 'real' moment that the rest of the episode.\\" Furthermore, Pierson criticized the characterization of Dwight, noting that his actions were \\"stupidly na√Øve\\". Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\". He felt that the episode was \\"akin to a newborn deer working the wobbles out of its legs\\" and that \\"it‚Äôs a milestone for The Office, in that it represents the first time an episode generated so much material it could‚Äôve occupied a full hour of airtime\\". He felt that Michael's plot was funny, but had issues. He argued that the retooling of Michael's character made him a more likable character even when he was doing something inappropriate; in this episode, however, his behavior is too cringe-inducing. Adams praised the scene wherein Dwight emerged from the box, calling it one of \\"The Offices first great sight gags\\". Furthermore, he felt that the scene was symbolic, as it produced \\"a stronger, deadlier, better character\\".

First proposed by George Hammond in 1955, the postulate states that: Solomons, T.W. Graham & Fryhle, Craig B. (2004). Organic Chemistry (8th ed.). John Wiley & Sons, Inc. . Loudon, G. Marc. \\"Organic Chemistry\\" 4th ed. 2005. > If two states, as, for example, a transition state and an unstable > intermediate, occur consecutively during a reaction process and have nearly > the same energy content, their interconversion will involve only a small > reorganization of the molecular structures. Therefore, the geometric structure of a state can be predicted by comparing its energy to the species neighboring it along the reaction coordinate. For example, in an exothermic reaction the transition state is closer in energy to the reactants than to the products. Therefore, the transition state will be more geometrically similar to the reactants than to the products. In contrast, however, in an endothermic reaction the transition state is closer in energy to the products than to the reactants. So, according to Hammond‚Äôs postulate the structure of the transition state would resemble the products more than the reactants. This type of comparison is especially useful because most transition states cannot be characterized experimentally. Hammond's postulate also helps to explain and rationalize the Bell‚ÄìEvans‚ÄìPolanyi principle. Namely, this principle describes the experimental observation that the rate of a reaction, and therefore its activation energy, is affected by the enthalpy of that reaction. Hammond's postulate explains this observation by describing how varying the enthalpy of a reaction would also change the structure of the transition state. In turn, this change in geometric structure would alter the energy of the transition state, and therefore the activation energy and reaction rate as well. The postulate has also been used to predict the shape of reaction coordinate diagrams. For example, electrophilic aromatic substitutions involves a distinct intermediate and two less well defined states. By measuring the effects of aromatic substituents and applying Hammond's postulate it was concluded that the rate-determining step involves formation of a transition state that should resemble the intermediate complex. History During the 1940s and 1950s, chemists had trouble explaining why even slight changes in the reactants caused significant differences in the rate and product distributions of a reaction. In 1955 George Hammond, a young professor at Iowa State University, postulated that transition-state theory could be used to qualitatively explain the observed structure-reactivity relationships. Notably, John E. Leffler of Florida State University proposed a similar idea in 1953. However, Hammond's version has received more attention since its qualitative nature was easier to understand and employ than Leffler's complex mathematical equations. Hammond's postulate is sometimes called the Hammond‚ÄìLeffler postulate to give credit to both scientists. Interpreting the postulate Effectively, the postulate states that the structure of a transition state resembles that of the species nearest to it in free energy. This can be explained with reference to potential energy diagrams: Energy diagrams showing how to interpret Hammond's Postulate In case (a), which is an exothermic reaction, the energy of the transition state is closer in energy to that of the reactant than that of the intermediate or the product. Therefore, from the postulate, the structure of the transition state also more closely resembles that of the reactant. In case (b), the energy of the transition state is close to neither the reactant nor the product, making none of them a good structural model for the transition state. Further information would be needed in order to predict the structure or characteristics of the transition state. Case (c) depicts the potential diagram for an endothermic reaction, in which, according to the postulate, the transition state should more closely resemble that of the intermediate or the product. Another significance of Hammond‚Äôs postulate is that it permits us to discuss the structure of the transition state in terms of the reactants, intermediates, or products. In the case where the transition state closely resembles the reactants, the transition state is called ‚Äúearly‚Äù while a ‚Äúlate‚Äù transition state is the one that closely resembles the intermediate or the product. An example of the ‚Äúearly‚Äù transition state is chlorination. Chlorination favors the products because it is an exothermic reaction, which means that the products are lower in energy than the reactants. When looking at the adjacent diagram (representation of an \\"early\\" transition state), one must focus on the transition state, which is not able to be observed during an experiment. To understand what is meant by an ‚Äúearly‚Äù transition state, the Hammond postulate represents a curve that shows the kinetics of this reaction. Since the reactants are higher in energy, the transition state appears to be right after the reaction starts. An example of the ‚Äúlate‚Äù transition state is bromination. Bromination favors the reactants because it is an endothermic reaction, which means that the reactants are lower in energy than the products. Since the transition state is hard to observe, the postulate of bromination helps to picture the ‚Äúlate‚Äù transition state (see the representation of the \\"late\\" transition state). Since the products are higher in energy, the transition state appears to be right before the reaction is complete. One other useful interpretation of the postulate often found in textbooks of organic chemistry is the following: :Assume that the transition states for reactions involving unstable intermediates can be closely approximated by the intermediates themselves. This interpretation ignores extremely exothermic and endothermic reactions which are relatively unusual and relates the transition state to the intermediates which are usually the most unstable. Structure of transition states=SN1 reactions Energy diagrams of SN1 reactions Hammond's postulate can be used to examine the structure of the transition states of a SN1 reaction. In particular, the dissociation of the leaving group is the first transition state in a SN1 reaction. The stabilities of the carbocations formed by this dissociation are known to follow the trend tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl. Therefore, since the tertiary carbocation is relatively stable and therefore close in energy to the R-X reactant, then the tertiary transition state will have a structure that is fairly similar to the R-X reactant. In terms of the graph of reaction coordinate versus energy, this is shown by the fact that the tertiary transition state is further to the left than the other transition states. In contrast, the energy of a methyl carbocation is very high, and therefore the structure of the transition state is more similar to the intermediate carbocation than to the R-X reactant. Accordingly, the methyl transition state is very far to the right.  SN2 reactions  Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reactions are concerted reactions where both the nucleophile and substrate are involved in the rate limiting step. Since this reaction is concerted, the reaction occurs in one step, where the bonds are broken, while new bonds are formed. Therefore, to interpret this reaction, it is important to look at the transition state, which resembles the concerted rate limiting step. In the \\"Depiction of SN2 Reaction\\" figure, the nucleophile forms a new bond to the carbon, while the halide (L) bond is broken.  E1 reactions Unimolecular Elimination Reaction Mechanism An E1 reaction consists of a unimolecular elimination, where the rate determining step of the mechanism depends on the removal of a single molecular species. This is a two- step mechanism. The more stable the carbocation intermediate is, the faster the reaction will proceed, favoring the products. Stabilization of the carbocation intermediate lowers the activation energy. The reactivity order is (CH3)3C- > (CH3)2CH- > CH3CH2- > CH3-. Unimolecular Elimination Reaction Coordinate Furthermore, studies describe a typical kinetic resolution process that starts out with two enantiomers that are energetically equivalent and, in the end, forms two energy-inequivalent intermediates, referred to as diastereomers. According to Hammond's postulate, the more stable diastereomer is formed faster.  E2 reactions  Elimination, bimolecular reactions are one step, concerted reaction where both base and substrate participate in the rate limiting step. In an E2 mechanism, a base takes a proton near the leaving group, forcing the electrons down to make a double bond, and forcing off the leaving group-all in one concerted step. The rate law depends on the first order concentration of two reactants, making it a 2nd order (bimolecular) elimination reaction. Factors that affect the rate determining step are stereochemistry, leaving groups, and base strength. A theory, for an E2 reaction, by Joseph Bunnett suggests the lowest pass through the energy barrier between reactants and products is gained by an adjustment between the degrees of CŒ≤-H and CŒ±-X rupture at the transition state. The adjustment involves much breaking of the bond more easily broken, and a small amount of breaking of the bond which requires more energy. This conclusion by Bunnett is a contradiction from the Hammond postulate. The Hammond postulate is the opposite of what Bunnett theorized. In the transition state of a bond breaking step it involves little breaking when the bond is easily broken and much breaking when it is difficult to break. Despite these differences, the two postulates are not in conflict since they are concerned with different sorts of processes. Hammond focuses on reaction steps where one bond is made or broken, or the breaking of two or more bonds is done with no time taken occur simultaneously. The E2 theory transition state concerns a process when bond formation or breaking are not simultaneous.  Kinetics and the Bell‚ÄìEvans‚ÄìPolanyi principle Technically, Hammond's postulate only describes the geometric structure of a chemical reaction. However, Hammond's postulate indirectly gives information about the rate, kinetics, and activation energy of reactions. Hence, it gives a theoretical basis for the understanding the Bell‚ÄìEvans‚ÄìPolanyi principle, which describes the experimental observation that the enthalpy and rate of a similar reactions were usually correlated. Energy diagrams of SN1 reactions The relationship between Hammond's postulate and the BEP principle can be understood by considering a SN1 reaction. Although two transition states occur during a SN1 reaction (dissociation of the leaving group and then attack by the nucleophile), the dissociation of the leaving group is almost always the rate-determining step. Hence, the activation energy and therefore rate of the reaction will depend only upon the dissociation step. First, consider the reaction at secondary and tertiary carbons. As the BEP principle notes, experimentally SN1 reactions at tertiary carbons are faster than at secondary carbons. Therefore, by definition, the transition state for tertiary reactions will be at a lower energy than for secondary reactions. However, the BEP principle cannot justify why the energy is lower. Using Hammond's postulate, the lower energy of the tertiary transition state means that its structure is relatively closer to its reactants R(tertiary)-X than to the carbocation product when compared to the secondary case. Thus, the tertiary transition state will be more geometrically similar to the R(tertiary)-X reactants than the secondary transition state is to its R(secondary)-X reactants. Hence, if the tertiary transition state is close in structure to the (low energy) reactants, then it will also be lower in energy because structure determines energy. Likewise, if the secondary transition state is more similar to the (high energy) carbocation product, then it will be higher in energy.  Applying the postulate  Hammond's postulate is useful for understanding the relationship between the rate of a reaction and the stability of the products. While the rate of a reaction depends just on the activation energy (often represented in organic chemistry as ŒîG‚Ä° ‚Äúdelta G double dagger‚Äù), the final ratios of products in chemical equilibrium depends only on the standard free-energy change ŒîG (‚Äúdelta G‚Äù). The ratio of the final products at equilibrium corresponds directly with the stability of those products. Hammond's postulate connects the rate of a reaction process with the structural features of those states that form part of it, by saying that the molecular reorganizations have to be small in those steps that involve two states that are very close in energy. This gave birth to the structural comparison between the starting materials, products, and the possible \\"stable intermediates\\" that led to the understanding that the most stable product is not always the one that is favored in a reaction process.  Explaining seemingly contradictory results  Hammond's postulate is especially important when looking at the rate-limiting step of a reaction. However, one must be cautious when examining a multistep reaction or one with the possibility of rearrangements during an intermediate stage. In some cases, the final products appear in skewed ratios in favor of a more unstable product (called the kinetic product) rather than the more stable product (the thermodynamic product). In this case one must examine the rate-limiting step and the intermediates. Often, the rate-limiting step is the initial formation of an unstable species such as a carbocation. Then, once the carbocation is formed, subsequent rearrangements can occur. In these kinds of reactions, especially when run at lower temperatures, the reactants simply react before the rearrangements necessary to form a more stable intermediate have time to occur. At higher temperatures when microscopic reversal is easier, the more stable thermodynamic product is favored because these intermediates have time to rearrange. Whether run at high or low temperatures, the mixture of the kinetic and thermodynamic products eventually reach the same ratio, one in favor of the more stable thermodynamic product, when given time to equilibrate due to microreversal.

The episode aired on NBC in the United States on April 19, 2005. The episode was written and directed by producer Greg Daniels, marking both his first solo writing credit and first directing credit for the series. This episode also marks the first appearance of comedian Patrice O'Neal. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and the office staff take on the workers in the warehouse in a basketball game. Owing to racist and sexist stereotypes, Michael chooses many less-skilled office workers for the team over their more athletically talented peers. Michael claims a \\"flagrant personal intentional foul,\\" stops the game, and declares his team as the winners. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure and concedes the victory to the warehouse staff. The episode was inspired by a deleted scene from the first episode where Michael talks about a pick-up basketball game. For two days, the cast of The Office played actual basketball games, which were then spliced together to give the effect of one continuous game. In addition, several lines from the episode became fans and cast favorites. \\"Basketball\\" was viewed by an estimated 5.0 million viewers and received a 2.4/6% rating share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) comes into work prepared to pit the office staff against the warehouse in a game of basketball, with the losers having to work on Saturday. Michael picks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), and Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), the last of whom he believes possesses significant basketball skills based on a racial stereotype. In addition, he also reluctantly picks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith), but refuses to pick Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) or Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner). The game begins and Stanley proves to be a horrible player. Furthermore, Michael cannot make a shot, nor is he a fan of passing or defending. Upon gaining possession of the ball, Michael fools around and intentionally acts stupid to tease the opponents, which results in Roy Anderson (David Denman) snatching the ball and scoring against Michael's team. Despite the fact that Michael is the one who foolishly lost the ball, he blames the scoring on his teammates' ineptitude. Jim switches with Michael on defense and defends Roy. As Jim begins to show his prowess at the game, Roy and Jim gradually become aggressive toward each other, with Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) looking on. At a crucial point in the game, Michael is accidentally hit in the face and claims it is a \\"flagrant personal intentional foul\\". He pettily stops the game and declares the office winners since they were winning when the foul occurred. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure, conceding the victory to the warehouse staff. As everybody returns to work, Kevin demonstrates his excellent shooting skills. Afterwards, Michael, in a rare moment of heart, tells the office that they do not have to come in on Saturday either. However, his justification does little to calm them: \\"Like coming in an extra day is going to prevent us from being downsized.\\" Production John Krasinski, a former high school basketball star, performed all his own stunts in the episode. \\"Basketball\\" was written and directed by producer Greg Daniels.Daniels, Greg (Writer, Director). 2005. \\"Basketball\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season One (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal.

Daniels later said that his favorite shot from the episode was when Michael takes Ryan on a tour of the warehouse because \\"you got to see the whole basketball [set].\\" The editors' cut for the episode was 40 minutes long. During the commentary for the episode, Steve Carell argued that the American version of The Office was more difficult to shoot because the British version was 29 minutes long, whereas the American version could only be 22 minutes.Carell, Steve (Actor). 2005. \\"Basketball\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season One (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. The inspiration for the episode was a deleted scene from the pilot episode where Michael talks about a pick-up basketball game. During filming, the cast and crew were filmed playing real basketball games for two days. The takes were then spliced together to make it appear as if only one game had taken place. NBC was worried about the episode because several of their other pilots had done basketball episodes. The network put a lot of pressure on the cast and crew to make the episode appear \\"as realistic as it could be.\\" Donald Lee Harris designed the warehouse set, which Krasinski described as \\"amazing\\" and \\"detailed.\\" Several of the actors had basketball experience, such as Krasinski, who played for his high school team.Novak, B.J. (Actor). 2005. \\"Basketball\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season One (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. Brian Baumgartner, who portrays Kevin, actually succeeded in making 14 free-throw shots, of which several were included in the final footage. Steve Carell later said of his basketball skills, \\"The thing about looking like you're bad at basketball is, it's like anything else, you have to be incredibly good in order to look bad [‚Ä¶] but that's not the case with me and basketball. I just was bad.\\" However, Carell joked that he would \\"kick ass\\" at a hockey episode, a reference to his real-life hockey skills. \\"Basketball\\" contained several lines that became fan and cast favorites. Two of Michael's lines, \\"The hand strikes and gives a flower\\" and \\"Blessed be those who sit and wait\\" were described by Wilson as Confucian and biblical, respectively. Carell joked that Michael Scott himself should self-publish a book of inspirational sayings. Jenna Fischer revealed that her line, \\"Please don't throw garbage at me\\" was her favorite line of the first season. Michael's line, \\"Try not to be too gay on the court\\" was improvised by Carell and Krasinski's reaction was real, as he had no idea Carell was going to say it. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on April 19, 2005, \\"Basketball\\" was viewed by an estimated 5.0 million viewers and received a 2.4/6% rating share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Alt URL This means that it was seen by 2.4% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode, airing after Scrubs, retained 92 percent of its lead-in audience. Reviews The episode received moderately positive reviews from critics. Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, signifying a \\"good\\" episode. Fickett commented that \\"Basketball\\" was stylistically different from most of the other episodes in the fledgling series, pointing to its lack of a sub-plot and its characterization of Michael Scott. Fickett, when discussing the latter, singled out the moment wherein Michael hurts Phyllis' feelings by telling her she can't play basketball, writing, \\"The moment is played mostly straight‚Äìand it does feel more realistic and uncomfortable and in that way, the show leans more towards the feel of the UK series. It's a great moment, but feels like a different show.\\" Overall, he wrote that, \\"There is still quite a bit of funny stuff [in 'Basketball'], but in many ways, this episode suggests what the show would have been like had it taken a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style.\\" Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\". Jenna Mullins from E! News referred to \\"Basketball\\" as her \\"all-time favorite episode of The Office\\" in an article about Steve Carell's last episode of the series. Not all reviews were as positive, however. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C+\\" and highly criticized the characterization of Michael. Largely, he felt that Michael's antics made him out to be a jerk because the series has not worked at showing that he truly \\"isn‚Äôt a complete asshole\\". Adams noted that Michael \\"could truly force Darryl and his staff to work on Saturdays, and he truly could fire them for winning the basketball game. But that would be an outrageous abuse of legitimate power, which isn‚Äôt funny.\\" Ultimately he argued that the basketball scenes went on for too long; he said the \\"episode‚Äôs original cut ran too long to air, and it‚Äôs obvious where the basketball scenes boxed out other threads of the episode\\".

In order to distinguish it from the piastra issued on the island of Sicily, it is referred to as the \\"Neapolitan piastra\\" as opposed to the \\"Sicilian piastra\\". These two piastra were equal but were subdivided differently. The Neapolitan piastra was divided into 120 grana (singular: grano), each of 2 tornesi (singular: tornese) or 12 cavalli (singular: cavallo). There were also the carlino worth 10 grana and the ducato worth 100 grana. In 1812, the Neapolitan lira was introduced by the occupying French in an attempt to decimalize the Neapolitan currency units. However the attempt failed and the decimalization was limited to changing the value of the cavallo to one tenth of a grano. After restoration of Bourbon control, a single currency was issued for the whole of the Two Sicilies, see Two Sicilies piastra. This new piastra was subdivided in the same way as the Neapolitan piastra. Coins Ferdinand IV. In the late 18th century, coins circulated in denominations of 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12 cavalli, 3, 5, 8 and 10 tornesi, 10 (carlino), 20 (tar√¨), 60 (mezza piastra) and 120 grana (piastra) and 2, 3 and 6 ducati. On occasion also a 50 and 100 grana silver pieces had been struck, but not in the 18th century. The cavalli and tornesi denominations were struck in copper, with the grana denominations up to the piastra struck in silver and the higher denominations in gold. In 1799, the short-lived Neapolitan Republic issued copper 4 and 6 tornesi, and silver 6 and 12 carlini. The restored kingdom resumed coin production, issuing many of the earlier denominations, plus copper 4 and 6 tornesi. In 1810, a gold 40 franchi coin was issued, a prelude to the introduction of the lira three years later.

He retired in the late 1980s, after serving over fourteen years as CEO. Aside from his tenure at Xerox, McColough was treasurer of the Democratic National Committee between 1972 and 1974, was chairman of United Way of America, and served on the Board of Trustees at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York Stock Exchange, Bank of New York, Wachovia, Citigroup, Knight Ridder, and Union Carbide Corporation. C. Peter McColough is also the namesake of the C. Peter McColough Roundtable Series on International Economics, part of the Council on Foreign Relations. This program was enacted and funded by the Council on Foreign Relations upon McColough's retirement as a director on the Council's Board for nine years. McColough also served as Treasurer between 1985 and 1987, Chairman of the Finance and Budget Committee between 1981 and 1987, and served as chairman of the Campaign for the Council between 1983 and 1985. He resided with his wife, Mary Virginia White McColough, in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida.  Family  C. Peter McColough was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. He was the first-born child of the late Dr. Reginald Walker McColough, and the late Barbara Theresa Martin. Reginald McColough was a director of public works for the Parliament of Canada, and was responsible for the modernization and development of Cape Breton Island in northern Nova Scotia. His paternal family descended from Godfrey McCulloch of Scotland, and was a distant relation of Sir Walter Scott. After attendance at Halifax private schools, McColough enrolled at Dalhousie University, and graduated in 1943; he eventually received an honorary degree from Dalhousie later in life. After Dalhousie, McColough studied at Osgoode Law School in Toronto, and finally at the Harvard Business School, after briefly serving in the British Navy in World War II. McColough graduated from Harvard Business School in 1949, and became a US citizen in 1956. While living and working in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, McColough met and married socialite Mary Virginia White, daughter of James J. White II, CEO of J.J. White Incorporated, one of the largest family-owned business in the East Coast of the United States that is still in operation today. They had five children: Peter McColough (died 1987), Andrew McColough, Virginia McColough Keeshan, Ian McColough, and Robert McColough (died 1999). The family lived in Rochester, New York until McColough moved Xerox headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut, and then resided in the nearby suburb of Greenwich, Connecticut. McColough additionally had seven grandchildren: Alexander McColough, Charles McColough, Austin McColough, Peter McColough, Caroline Keeshan, Paul Keeshan, and Katherine McColough. Career Photo of the late C. Peter McColough, founder of the Xerox Corporation. McColough worked initially for Lehigh Navigation Coal Sales Company in the USA before making the switch in 1954 to Xerox, then a little-known manufacturer of industrial photocopiers and still known as the Haloid Company. Five years after that career move, his new firm introduced its first office photocopier. As one of the first companies to step into the lucrative arena and potential growth market, Xerox's annual revenues soared from $40 million in 1960 to almost $3 billion in the early 1970s. After taking over the presidency of the firm in 1966, McColough significantly changed and altered the direction and goals of Xerox Corporation. By 1979, McColough had built up Xerox revenues to $7 billion a year and its annual earnings to $563 million. The company's chief scientist told Forbes Magazine in 1980 that \\"in the late 1960s, Peter McColough redefined our company.\\" From 1970 through to the mid-1980s he has held several directorships and in 1970, was honoured by his former alma mater, Dalhousie University, with an Honorary Doctorate.  Assessments  The consensus of various business and economic journalists is that McColough as CEO was a restless, energetic but amiable man who had little time for memos, letters and meetings that normally make up the routine of daily corporate life. Despite a well-off upbringing, McColough worked himself from an executive salesperson of Haloid to a chairman and CEO of Xerox. McColough's philosophy was always one of strong leadership by example. He explained once to Business Week that \\"a company is made not only by the quality of its products and services, but also by its people, especially its top people,\\" and in doing so revealed the key to his business career. On May 2, 1968, McColough and his partner Joseph C. Wilson sent out a memo announcing the company intended to start an affirmative action program, making Xerox one of the first companies to do so. McColough and Xerox have been both praised and criticized for it. McColough started the PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), meant to operate something like AT&T;'s Bell Labs. PARC researchers developed pioneering commercial products in the field of personal computers‚Äîsuch as the Alto personal computer, GUI (graphical user interface), the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, the first commercial mouse, Ethernet network architecture, OOP (object-oriented programming), PDL (Page Description Language), Internet protocols, and laser printing. But McColough and Xerox have been criticized for failing to take advantage of the opportunities PARC provided. \\"In spite of being a veritable cradle of innovation during the formative years of personal computing and the Internet, PARC rarely convinced Xerox to take its ideas from laboratory prototypes to commercially successful products,\\" stated an article about PARC at the \\"Smart Computing in Plain English\\" Web site. \\"Many of the products were taken up successfully by other companies.\\"  Death and legacy  McColough died on December 13, 2006 after a long illness, according to his son Andrew McColough. His funeral took place in Greenwich, Connecticut, and was highly covered by international media outlets. Among those who gave eulogies were Vernon Jordan, a longtime friend and colleague, and David T. Kearns, another longtime friend who took over the reins at Xerox after McColough retired.

Mayo (August 25, 1951 ‚Äì February 23, 2004) was a session keyboardist and guitarist, perhaps best known for his work with Peter Frampton.[ Allmusic performance credits page]  Biography  Mayo was born in New York City, and grew up in Westchester County. He began studying music at the age of five, focusing on classical piano. During the 1960s, Mayo's interest in music grew due to the rock explosion. His first band was Ramble and the Descendants, where he played organ and sang. Mayo played with several other local bands and had plans to attend Juilliard School in New York City. His career took a detour when he suffered injuries in a serious car accident at the age of seventeen, but Mayo was determined and he was able to move on. In 1971, Mayo formed Doc Holliday with Frank Carillo, Tom Arlotta, and Bob Liggio. He then joined Rat Race Choir (73-74) one of the Tri-State area's best bands, playing guitar. He then left RRC, was replaced with Mark Hitt and teamed up with Peter Frampton and joined his touring band. Because of this, he appeared on Frampton's album Frampton Comes Alive!. It was on this recording, following Mayo's Fender Rhodes electric piano solo on the song Do You Feel Like We Do, that Frampton introduced him with the words \\"Bob Mayo on the keyboards... Bob Mayo!\\" Mayo also appeared on the Frampton albums I'm in You and Where I Should Be. In 1980, Mayo left Frampton's band to focus on recording. During this time, he recorded with Joe Walsh and Joe Vitale. Later he joined the touring band for Foreigner and played keyboards on \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\" and \\"Break It Up\\". He spent the next two years touring with Foreigner, and also toured with Dan Fogelberg and Hall & Oates in the late 1980s. He continued to tour with Hall & Oates until 1998. In 1981, Mayo was asked by Joey Kramer of Aerosmith to play keyboards in his band Renegade fronted by vocalist Marge Raymond. In 1983, Mayo played keyboards on Aerosmith's first tour in three years, in support of their Rock in a Hard Place album, also adding background vocals.Steve Newton, Aerosmith without Joe Perry: Remembering Rock in a Hard Place.

The 2007 Rhino re-issue of The Principle of Moments contains three live tracks from that tour. In 1992, Mayo returned to work with Peter Frampton. The resulting tour turned into the recording of the album \\"Frampton Comes Alive II\\". He also appeared on the Live in Detroit CD & DVD as well as Peter Frampton's 2003 recording Now. On February 23, 2004, Mayo was touring with Peter Frampton in Basel, Switzerland, when he had a heart attack and died. Frampton said regarding him, \\"Bob was like a brother to me.

In order to distinguish it from the piastra issued on the mainland Kingdom of Sicily (also known as the Kingdom of Naples), it is referred to as the \\"Sicilian piastra\\" as opposed to the \\"Neapolitan piastra\\". These two piastra were equal but were subdivided differently. The Sicilian piastra was subdivided into 12 tar√¨, each of 20 grana or 120 piccoli. The oncia was worth 30 tar√¨ (2¬Ω piastra). In 1815, a single piastra currency was introduced for the Two Sicilies, see Two Sicilies piastra. Coins In the late 18th century, coins were circulating in denominations of 3 piccoli, 1, 2, 10 and 20 grana, 2, 3, 4 and 6 tari, 1 piastra and 1 oncia. These were struck in copper up to the 2 grana, with the higher denominations in silver. In 1801, copper 5 and 10 grana were introduced, followed by a gold 2 oncia in 1814. Following the adoption of the unified currency for the two Sicilies, copper coins were issued in 1835 and 1836 bearing the name \\"Siciliana\\", in denominations of ¬Ω, 1, 2, 5 and 10 grana. It is unclear whether these coins were denominated in Two Sicilies grana or the old Sicilian grana (worth half as much). Riveli From a Riveli in 1607 Catania, also a Riveli in 1811 Avola, the Sicilian money system can be readily extracted. It was:- :1 onze = 30 Tari, 1 Taro = 20 Grani, 1 Grano = 6 piccioli. On both of these historic documents, the denomination Piastra was not used. A Sicilian coin commonly available for sale today is the 120 Grana silver piece, weighing an ounce. It is called, in the supplementary description of this silver piece, one piastre. However in 1823 George Crabb, in his Universal Technological Dictionary Volume 2, in addition to supporting the above relative values of Onzio, Tari and Grani in accounting, lists 120 Grani as equivalent to one Florino. Crabb also lists the Ponto, the Carlino, the Ducat and the Scudo or Crown and their equivalence to the Grano, however no mention of the Piastre.

After graduating in philosophy from the Charles University in Prague and studying music under Bohuslav Matƒõj ƒåernohorsk√Ω, Jan Zach, and others, Seger became organist of two churches in Prague and remained there until his death. An extremely prolific composer, Seger became one of the most important representatives of the Czech organ school of the 18th century. He was also an influential teacher: his pupils included Jan Anton√≠n Ko≈æeluh and Josef Mysliveƒçek,ƒåernu≈°√°k 1963. and his figured bass exercises served many generations of teachers. Life Seger was born in ≈òep√≠n, near Mƒõln√≠k, in Bohemia. He studied at the Jesuit Gymnasium in Prague and later graduated in philosophy at the Charles University. He also studied organ playing with Bohuslav Matƒõj ƒåernohorsk√Ω, counterpoint with Jan Zach and Franti≈°ek T≈Øma, and, according to Dlabac≈æ, figured bass with Felix Benda.Po≈°tolka, Grove. Around 1741 Seger became organist to the Church of Our Lady in front of T√Ωn and in 1745 he acquired a similar post at the Crusaders' church in Prague. He held both positions until his death. In 1781 Emperor Joseph II was sufficiently impressed with Seger's playing and offered the composer a court appointment, but Seger died in Prague in 1782 before the confirming document arrived. None of Seger's compositions were published during his lifetime, but he was an important teacher and educator. His pupils included Karel Bla≈æej Kop≈ôiva, Jan Anton√≠n Ko≈æeluh, Jan K≈ôtitel Kucha≈ô, Josef Mysliveƒçek, and many other distinguished Bohemian composers and musicians. A few of Seger's pieces appeared in print in the 1790s; a selection of eight organ fugues was published by D. G. T√ºrk in 1793. In 1803, J. Polt published Seger's ten preludes for organ, and a few more works followed in the next few decades. Particularly important was the publication of a portion of his figured bass exercises, which were used by teachers for decades after his death. Works Seger was the most prolific Czech organ composer of the 18th century. Hundreds of preludes, fugues, toccatas and other organ pieces survive in manuscript copies, although the attribution to Seger of some of these works is problematic. Generally speaking, his preludes and fugues are short works (their length probably dictated by the limitations imposed by the Catholic liturgy), but they exhibit a fertile harmonic imagination and a perfect grasp of late Baroque counterpoint practice. He also composed masses, motets and psalm settings; all also dominated by archaic counterpoint. Selected works=Keyboard * 8 Toccaten und Fugen, ed. D.G.

The trail forks right; the drainage ditch to the left. A water bar or interceptor dyke is a road construction feature that is used to prevent erosion on sloping roads, cleared paths through woodland (for utility companies such as electricity pylons), or other accessways by reducing flow length. It is a diagonal channel across the road that diverts surface water (that would otherwise flow down the whole length of the road) off the road and into a stable drain way. By constructing a series of water bars at intervals along a road, the volume of water flowing down the road is reduced. Without water bars, flooding, washouts, and accelerated road degradation can occur. The drain way carries the water that would otherwise be carried by the road. For proper operation of the water bars it must be stable and regularly inspected to ensure that it is free of silt buildup or other obstructions.

Nearby neighbourhoods include Vitan, Olteni»õei, and Berceni. Originally a village, it was incorporated into Bucharest as it expanded. Its name is related to the Wallachian aristocratic VƒÉcƒÉrescu family, with an etymology leading back to the Romanian , \\"cow- herder,\\" and the suffix -e»ôti. The Monastery and quarter Spies taken from the Russian camp to the VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Prison, Bucharest The VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Monastery, built by Nicholas Mavrocordatos in 1716, was located on the VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti hill, nowadays near Pia»õa Sudului, but it was demolished in 1984 during the regime of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu to make room for a Palace of Justice that was never built. It was the largest 18th-century monastery in Southeastern Europe and it had a church in the style of Curtea de Arge»ô Cathedral. It was also designed to be used as a fortress, and was seized in May 1771 by the Imperial Russian army, under commander Nikolai Vasilyeich Repnin, in the context of the Russo- Turkish War and P√¢rvu Cantacuzino's rebellion. Part of the buildings of the monastery were used as a prison. Inmates that were incarcerated at VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Prison include Richard Wurmbrand, Tudor Arghezi, Ioan Slavici, as well as Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and other members of the Iron Guard. The nearby hill was home to Arghezi's long-time residence, the house he nicknamed MƒÉr»õi»ôor (nowadays a museum). Jewish history In the 19th century, many Jewish immigrants settled in VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti, most of them coming from Imperial Russia. VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti and Dude»ôti were the areas where the poorest Jews settled. On 21 January 1941, the fascist Iron Guard started its coup against Ion Antonescu, with whom they had shared government power since September (see Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom). The Iron Guard legionnaires killed 125 Jews, including in VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti and Dude»ôti. On 24 January 1941 Ion Antonescu suppressed the rebellion and the Iron Guard was banned and the members arrested. Almost all the Jews emigrated to the newly created state of Israel after World War II. VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti was one of the quarters that was completely torn down by Ceau»ôescu and nowadays few traces of the old quarters remain. VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Lake VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Lake In the 1980s, Ceau»ôescu wanted to build a large amusement park (3 km¬≤), demolishing a sparsely built area and making place for a lake with a concrete bottom. However, it was never completed and it still remains barren as of 2009. In 2002, 1.83 km¬≤ of the terrain were given for 49 years to a company owned by Australian citizen Tony Mikhael that wanted to invest ‚Ç¨650 million and build some residential areas as well as a golf course, a hippodrome, a hotel and some clubs. The terrain itself is estimated to be worth about ‚Ç¨500 million, as the land costs in the area around ‚Ç¨300/m¬≤.

She is notable as the author of the first astrology book to make The New York Times Best Seller list. Early life and background Linda Goodman was born in Morgantown, West Virginia. Although Goodman never revealed her year of birth, swearing even her father to silence, it emerged posthumously that she was born in 1925. According to data collector Frank C. Clifford, Linda was born on April 9, 1925, in Morgantown, West Virginia, at 6:05 a.m. Clifford cites Linda's birth certificate as his source. Her father's name was Robert Stratton Kemery. Her mother's maiden name was Mazie McBee. By her own account, she was born in her maternal grandparents' house on 115 Kingwood Street. She attended and graduated from Parkersburg High School in 1943 aged 18 years. Career Linda Goodman assumed the name \\"Linda\\" during World War II for a popular WCOM radio show in Parkersburg that she hosted called Love Letters from Linda. Each show consisted of Linda reading letters written between soldiers and their loved ones. Each letter was punctuated with a popular song of the day. While working in radio, she met her second husband, Sam O. Goodman, and took his last name. She began her career writing for newspapers in the eastern and southeastern United States. She also wrote speeches for black American civil rights leader Whitney Young, who served for several years as president of the National Urban League. Astrology/writings Some have suggested that Linda Goodman was responsible for accelerating the growth of the New Age movement through the unprecedented success of her first astrology book Linda Goodman's Sun Signs (1968). This was the first astrology book ever to earn a spot on The New York Times Best Seller list. It was followed by Linda Goodman's Love Signs (1978), which also made The New York Times Best Seller list and set an industry record with $2.3 million being paid for the paperback rights. Other books by Linda Goodman include: *Venus Trines at Midnight (1970) *Linda Goodman‚Äôs Love Poems (1980) *Linda Goodman‚Äôs Star Signs: The Secret Codes of the Universe A Practical Guide for the New Age (1987) *Gooberz (1989) *Linda Goodman‚Äôs Relationship Signs (1998) Gooberz, begun in 1967, is a long poem riddled with a myriad of occult references and symbolism. It is also a thinly veiled autobiography, which explores two of her significant romantic relationships: her marriage to William Snyder and her love affair with marine biologist Robert Brewer. It also touches on the birth of her four children Sally Snyder, Bill Snyder, Jill Goodman and Michael Goodman. The book surveys her ideas on reincarnation, karma, love, and miracles. Personal life Goodman was mother to four children: Sally and William (Bill) Snyder from her first marriage, and Jill and Michael Goodman from her second marriage. She also had at least one other child, a daughter who died in infancy. Daughter Goodman's books also reference what she referred to as the \\"disappearance\\" of her eldest daughter, Sally Snyder in the 1970s, and the mystery around her reported death. Linda Goodman spent much money and many years trying to find Sally, long after police closed the case as a suicide or accidental suicide. Goodman never accepted the official police report and continued to search for Sally for the rest of her own life.Finally she believed that her daughter is dead but she will come back by reincarnation as her prediction said. Death A businesswoman from Ireland named Crystal Bush befriended Goodman at the end of her life and obtained the publicity rights to Linda Goodman's name at her death. Crystal Bush published the book Linda Goodman's Relationship Signs after Linda's death. Linda made Cripple Creek, Colorado, her home during the latter part of her life. She first lived in a small Victorian house on Carr Street (\\"the little crooked house on the crooked little street\\") and later moved to a newer home on the outskirts of the main town. Both homes still boast her spiritually themed stained-glass windows. The house on Carr Street is now a bed and breakfast. She died in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on October 21, 1995, at the age of 70, from complications of diabetes.

It was based on the 1984 book of the same name by Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward, and adapted for the screen by Buckaroo Banzai creator Earl Mac Rauch.The Controversy Over Belushi Bio 'Wired'-Rolling Stone It stars Michael Chiklis in his film debut as Belushi. Wired was both a critical and a commercial failure. The film has yet to be released on DVD or Blu-ray, and the videocassette originally released by International Video Entertainment is out of print. Plot The story follows John Belushi (Michael Chiklis), shortly after his death from a drug overdose in March 1982, as he awakens in a morgue and is about to undergo an autopsy. Panicked, Belushi escapes and finds himself in the company of the enigmatic Angel Velasquez (Ray Sharkey), a Puerto Rican cabbie who takes Belushi to significant moments in his life from the beginning of his career to the courtship of his wife, Judith (Lucinda Jenney), into his burgeoning comedy career, his friendship with Dan Aykroyd (Gary Groomes) and his eventual decline. The film alternates between Belushi as a ghost and his journey with Velasquez to flashbacks (in non-linear style) as his career gains momentum. Meanwhile, journalist Bob Woodward (J. T. Walsh) is researching Belushi's life as he prepares to write a book about the late comic actor. Woodward's investigation leads him to Cathy Smith (Patti D'Arbanville), who procured drugs for Belushi, and the story climaxes with Woodward directly conversing with Belushi during the actor's dying moments.

Woodward, like Belushi, was from Wheaton, Illinois and had friends in common with him; Belushi had also been a fan of Woodward's investigative journalism. Although Woodward secured interviews with Belushi's family, friends and associates, he neither requested nor received approval from Judith before submitting his manuscript for publication. Those close to Belushi claimed that the book was exploitative and not representative of the man they knew. Nevertheless, Wired became a bestseller, albeit one that was publicly criticized by Belushi's family and friends for sensationalism, and for what they perceived to be a negative and one-sided portrait of the actor. Tanner Colby, who co-wrote a biography of Belushi in 2004, later claimed that while many of the anecdotes in Woodward's book were true, Woodward missed, or did not seek out, their meaning or context. Woodward sought to sell the book's film rights as early as 1984‚Äîthe year it was published‚Äîbut he found little interest in Hollywood for the project. Woodward later claimed, \\"A large portion of Hollywood didn't want this movie made because there's too much truth in it.\\"Zoglin. \\"Finally, The Belushi Story\\" Producers Edward S. Feldman and Charles R. Meeker eventually bought the film rights for the relatively modest sum of $300,000, and, lacking major studio funding, put up $1 million of the film's $13 million budget themselves. The rest of the film's funding came from the New Zealand conglomerate Lion Nathan. Woodward served as an uncredited technical adviser on the film; the screenplay was written by Earl Mac Rauch, whose previous writing credits included Martin Scorsese's New York, New York (1977) and the science-fiction comedy The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984). Hired to direct the film was Larry Peerce, a film and television veteran who had directed his wife Marilyn Hassett in the films The Other Side of the Mountain (1975), Two-Minute Warning (1976), The Other Side of the Mountain Part 2 (1978), and The Bell Jar (1979). Chiklis claimed it took the producers three years to cast the role of Belushi. Then aged 25, Chiklis heard about auditions for the part when he was weeks away from picking up his theatre arts degree at Boston University: \\"I rushed down to try out... In the first 24 hours, I was called back 57 times to see different people. It was the first movie I ever read for. I was called back three times at first, then six to eight months would go by and I'd be called again, asked to perform two to three times, then nothing for maybe 10 months. I'd just about given up hope, then I'd get another call for more auditions.\\" Chiklis finally won the role after being chosen over 200 other actors, and he put on 30 pounds for the part.Rolling Stone review The blue-eyed actor also wore brown contact lenses to more closely resemble Belushi. Development The film adaptation of Wired did little to separate itself from the book's dubious reputation (promotional material described Wired as \\"the film Hollywood didn't want made\\"). Like the book, the film was boycotted by several of Belushi's friends and family, including Judith Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Jim Belushi. However, in many ways, Wired diverged from its source material. The film was criticized due to the addition of several fictional elements that were not present in the book, such as the guardian angel character, and the addition of Woodward himself as a character. Other difficulties for the filmmakers during production included their inability to obtain the rights to Belushi's original Saturday Night Live skits, and so they were forced to write imitations, e.g. \\"Samurai Baseball.\\" However, the screenwriters did manage to work allusions and in-jokes to Belushi's routines into scenes and dialogue in the film. The film also alludes to the fact that Belushi's fictional guardian angel may not be sending him to Heaven but possibly Hell in the film's ending, when Belushi agrees to a pivotal pinball game‚Äîa parody of the chess game between the Knight and Death in the Ingmar Bergman film The Seventh Seal (1957). The characters of Wired are a mixture of real-life people and obvious facsimiles. Judith Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Bob Woodward and Cathy Smith, in addition to Belushi himself, appear by name in the film. Belushi's Saturday Night Live co-stars Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner and Laraine Newman are referred to but not seen. Other real-life associates of Belushi's are depicted onscreen, but assigned fictional names; for example, Brillstein is represented in the film by Alex Rocco's character \\"Arnie Fromson\\", and Belushi's minder Smokey Wendell is represented by Blake Clark's character \\"Dusty Jenkins.\\" Many real-life celebrities who figured prominently in Belushi's life and in Woodward's book (including Robert De Niro, Robin Williams, Ed Begley Jr., Treat Williams, Carrie Fisher and Steven Spielberg) are not depicted in the film at all. An obvious portrait is made of SNL producer Lorne Michaels, played by actor Joe Urla, although the role is listed as \\"Stage Manager\\". One scene in Wired features Joe Strummer's song \\"Love Kills\\", from the soundtrack to Sid and Nancy (1986), another biopic about a celebrity drug casualty, and which features a taxicab as a metaphor for the afterlife. In another scene in Wired, Billy Preston appears as himself, playing a piano accompaniment to Chiklis as Belushi singing the song \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" (co-written by Preston) in the style of Joe Cocker. Release Principal photography of Wired commenced in May 1988 and finished in the autumn of that year. The film was completed by the end of 1988; however, it did not receive a theatrical release until August 1989. The producers of Wired had problems finding a distributor for the film, as many of the major studios refused to distribute it. Several independent studios such as New Visions (then headed by Taylor Hackford) backed away from it. Atlantic Entertainment was about to distribute Wired, but financial problems prevented that from happening, so Taurus Entertainment agreed to distribute the film. In his book Tell Me How You Love The Picture: A Hollywood Life (2005), Feldman recalled the film's difficulties securing a distributor. He accused Hollywood powerbroker Michael Ovitz‚Äîwhose Creative Artists Agency had represented Belushi, as well as Aykroyd and Bill Murray‚Äîof using his influence to sabotage the production and distribution of Wired. Ovitz himself claimed that \\"The film will rise or fall based on its own merits... We have nothing to do with the movie.\\" Some studio executives claimed that their reluctance to distribute Wired was due to the film's dubious quality, rather than its subject matter. Brillstein accused the filmmakers of generating the controversy around the film themselves, in an attempt to improve its commercial prospects: \\"The only thing that the producers have to hang on to is the image of Wired as \\"the movie that Hollywood tried to stop\\"... I think this is a very good plan to get some excitement for the movie.\\" In April 1989, the Los Angeles Times published the article \\"Another Chapter in the Strange Odyssey of Wired,\\" chronicling in detail the obstacles the film faced throughout its production. Wired screened at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival in May, three months before the film's general release. Jack Mathews of the Times wrote that while Wired was \\"one of the most anticipated films in the festival\\", by the end a \\"smattering of applause was drowned out by whistles and jeers.\\" Afterwards, Woodward faced a hostile press conference in which he was bombarded with questions about his inclusion as a character in the film. Rita Kempley of the Post also reported that the Cannes reception \\"recalled a hive of John Belushi's killer bees.\\" Reception=Critical reception The critical response to Wired was almost uniformly hostile. Wired has an overall approval rating of 4% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 2.9/10. The site's critics' consensus states: \\"A tasteless unintentional parody of the life it attempts to dramatize, Wired butchers John Belushi's memory with a misguided screenplay and unnecessary recreations of classic performances.\\" Leonard Maltin condemned Wired as \\"the film fiasco of its year\\" and \\"mind-numbingly wrongheaded.\\" Maltin noted that Michael Chiklis \\"looks a little like Belushi but conveys none of his comic genius in some clumsy Saturday Night Live recreations\\" and that J. T. Walsh, \\"as Woodward, is an unintentional howl with the decade's most constipated performance.\\" Leonard Maltin's movie guide Maltin, Leonard-Internet Archive (pg.1539) Writing for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley dismissed the film as \\"the silliest celebrity bio since Mommie Dearest\\" and \\"a biography without an ounce of soul or a shred of dignity. Billed as a fantasy-comedy-drama, it manages to be none of these. The drama is laughable, the comedy lame, the fantasy without wings.\\" Kempley described the film's direction as \\"ludicrous\\", the script as \\"preposterous\\", and also criticised Michael Chiklis' portrayal of Belushi: \\"Sam Kinison might have played the part -- like Belushi, he's obscene, overweight, abusive and mad as hell. Chiklis, who does look and sound like Belushi, is rather cherubic in his movie debut. There's a Bambi-ish quality to his portrait of debauchery, a strangely cute requiem for a funny man.\\" Also writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wondered if the film is \\"what the real Belushi's family, friends and fans really need. Certainly Belushi deserves as much scrutiny as the next public figure who died after heavy drug use, but this autopsy seems unnecessary.\\" Howe had no praise for Michael Chiklis' performance as Belushi: \\"Despite a histrionic outpouring of growls, snorts, yells and re-creations of familiar Belushi shticks, from Jake Elmore to Joe Cocker, Chiklis seems to miss every opportunity to redeem himself. He's loud where he should have been soft, flat where he should have been funny and dead where he should have been alive.\\" Howe also noted that the film version of Woodward \\"seems to have stumbled out of a Dragnet episode.\\" Vincent Canby for The New York Times described the film as \\"a bit fuzzy and off-center.\\" Canby also noted that Chiklis \\"seems to be doing the role a few years too soon. It's not only that he seems too young, but also that he simply hasn't any idea of what it's like to scrape the bottom of life's barrel.\\" Canby did praise Patti D'Arbanville, \\"who is exceptionally good as the addict who fatally ministers to Belushi in his last hours. She's a lost, sad character, more vivid than anyone else in the movie.\\" Roger Hurlburt of the Sun-Sentinel also gave Wired a 1¬Ω-star rating, writing that \\"we have director Larry Peerce thinking he's Frank Capra doing It's a Wonderful Life, or worse, Charles Dickens reworking A Christmas Carol... As a film that relies on mystical scenes to join together fact, plus appearing and disappearing characters scattered among confusing time sequences, Wired is a movie of overkill. The fact is, Belushi becomes more unlikable, more idiotic and more pathetically self-destructive as the film progresses.\\" Caryn James for The New York Times began her Wired review with the words, \\"There is almost no excuse for Wired, a film so devastatingly dull that it seems longer than John Belushi's whole career\\", before adding \\"audiences do not like their pop icons tampered with, and in biographical films such tampering is inevitable. Audiences bring to such films vivid images of people they feel they know, and they have consistently rejected films that fail to reflect that image... Any weeknight, viewers can turn on television reruns of the Saturday Night Live shows that made Belushi famous. And no matter how much Michael Chiklis, the star of Wired, resembles Belushi, his Killer Bee and his Joe Cocker imitation are no match for the highly visible, memorable, syndicated originals.\\" Rolling Stone labeled the film \\"a howling dog...Whether by design or by forced compromise, Wired is even more of a gloss than the candy-assed view of Jerry Lee Lewis in Great Balls of Fire!. Far from pointing any fingers, Wired the movie hardly names names...it appears that nearly everyone Belushi encountered in big, bad Hollywood tried to warn him off demon drugs. Wired packs all the investigative wallop of a Care Bears flick.\\" The review also criticizes Michael Chiklis for capturing \\"none of Belushi's charm, warmth or genius. It's excruciating to watch Chiklis drain the wit from such classic Belushi routines as the Samurai, the Bees and the Blues Brothers.\\" In 2008, writer Nathan Rabin posted a retrospective on Wired for his series \\"My Year of Flops\\" on The A.V. Club. Rabin wrote, \\"To call Wired an unconscionable act of grave robbery/defilement would be an insult to the good name of grave-robbers everywhere. There are snuff films with more integrity... Watching Wired, the two questions that pop up constantly are 'What the hell were they thinking?' followed by 'What the hell were they smoking, and where can I get some?'... I will give Rauch's screenplay this much: it sure is audacious... Rauch apparently set out to write a biopic as irreverent, wild, and unconventional as Belushi himself. The stakes were high. Had the filmmakers succeeded, they would have reinvented the biopic by injecting it with vast ocean of gallows humor, magic realism, and postmodern mindfuckery. The filmmakers took enormous chances, none of which paid off. They shot for the moon and fell flat on their asses.\\" Richard Corliss, in his review of the film for Time Magazine, singled out Michael Chiklis's \\"boldly percussive performance\\", but described the film itself as a \\"turkey, overstuffed as it is with mad ambitions and bad karma.\\" In his review of Wired for the Houston Chronicle, Jeff Millar noted that Michael Chiklis \\"looks reasonably enough like Belushi, and he impersonates him well enough to make us frustratingly aware that he is not John Belushi... In the sequences when he is asked to imitate Belushi the entertainer, he is desperately overmatched ‚Äì any actor would be ‚Äì against the close memory of a hugely idiosyncratic comic actor.\\" Michael Wilmington for the Los Angeles Times praised the performances of Chiklis, D'Arbanville and Gary Groomes, but had mixed feelings about the film overall, noting that \\"the crippling flaw in the film lies in its mix of surface daring and inner funk. Inside, it keeps flinching.\\" Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \\"Maybe there was no way to make a good movie out of this material, not yet, when everyone remembers Belushi and any actor who attempts to play him is sure to suffer by comparison.\\" Awarding Wired 1¬Ω stars out of 4, Ebert noted that Wired \\"is in some ways a sincere attempt to deal with the material, but it is such an ungainly and hapless movie, so stupidly written, so awkwardly directed and acted, that it never gets off the ground.\\" In his syndicated movie review show Siskel & Ebert, Ebert did concede that Chiklis \\"did what he could\\" with his performance, while his partner Gene Siskel said that Chiklis and Groomes were very good and that the film could have been pulled off with better direction and a better script.The Package, Wired, Cookie, Little Monsters, The Little Thief, 1989 Siskel and Ebert Movie Reviews Family and friends' reactions Belushi's friend John Landis, who directed the actor in the films National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) and The Blues Brothers (1980), refused to have his name incorporated into Wired and threatened to sue for invasion of privacy, causing the producers to label a generic name on the film director who appears in the film. As played by Jon Snyder, the director is an obvious lookalike of Landis during the Blues Brothers sequence, and in the scene where he is walking across the movie set, a helicopter can be heard in the background (a reference to the fatal helicopter accident that occurred when Landis filmed Twilight Zone: The Movie). The film also depicts the director punching a coked-out Belushi in the face during the filming of The Blues Brothers. This event, recounted directly from the opening of Woodward's book, was dismissed by Landis as \\"not true\\". Dan Aykroyd was openly averse to Wired. During an interview for MTV's The Big Picture, he said, \\"I have witches working now to jinx the thing... I hope it never gets seen and I am going to hurl all the negative energy I can and muster all my hell energies [against them]. My thunderbolts are out on this one, quite truthfully.\\" Walsh, who played Woodward in Wired, was cast in a supporting role in the comedy Loose Cannons (1990) with Aykroyd, but Aykroyd had him removed from the film because of his participation in Wired. Walsh reportedly worked for two days on Loose Cannons before he was fired and replaced with Paul Koslo, causing the film a $125,000 production delay. Two years after the release of Wired, Judith Belushi wrote her book Samurai Widow (1991) to counter the image of her late husband portrayed in Woodward's work. She also co-wrote the 2005 oral history book, Belushi: A Biography, with Tanner Colby. Judith told Entertainment Weekly in 2013, \\"Like Michael Chiklis said, when he was a young man and was offered that role in [Wired], he thought it was a great opportunity and it was. He was just unfortunate not to have a better script because he himself was fine.\\" Impact on Chiklis' career Prior to the release of Wired, Patricia O'Haire of the New York Daily News suggested that Chiklis might be \\"priced out of reach\\" (i.e. by the film's success). Instead, Chiklis' participation in Wired derailed the actor's career for 18 months: \\"After Wired, everyone was afraid to touch me for fear of reprisal... It was a bittersweet situation. All of a sudden, I was starring in a major motion picture and the next thing you know, I'm being asked by reporters, 'Do you think you'll be blackballed?'\\" Chiklis later told James Belushi that he took on the lead role in Wired out of \\"love, respect and homage\\" for his brother, and apologised for any hurt he had caused Belushi's family. After numerous guest roles in episodic television (including Miami Vice, L.A. Law, Murphy Brown, and Seinfeld), Chiklis gained fame for portraying the lead roles of Commissioner Tony Scali on the ABC police drama The Commish (1991‚Äì1996), and LAPD Detective Vic Mackey on the FX police drama The Shield (2002‚Äì2008). His film career resurged when he played Marvel superhero Ben \\"The Thing\\" Grimm in the films Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007).

It was directed by Edward Dmytryk and produced by Buddy Adler, from a screenplay by Alfred Hayes, based on the novel The Left Hand of God, by William Edmund Barrett. Set at a small American mission in China in 1947, at a time of civil war, it stars Humphrey Bogart as a hunted man masquerading as a Catholic priest and Gene Tierney in the role of a nurse, with a supporting cast including Lee J. Cobb, Agnes Moorehead, E. G. Marshall, and Carl Benton Reid. While playing Anne Scott, Tierney became ill. Bogart had a personal experience as he was close to a sister who suffered from mental illness, so during the production, he fed Tierney her lines and encouraged her to seek help. Plot In 1947, Catholic priest Father O'Shea (Humphrey Bogart) makes his way to a remote mission in China to replace a priest who was killed there. He meets Dr. David Sigman (E.G. Marshall), Sigman's wife Beryl (Agnes Moorehead), and nurse Anne Scott (Gene Tierney), the only other Western residents. They run a hospital for the surrounding villagers, at a time when competing warlords and communists are engaged in civil war. O'Shea delivers his debut Sunday sermon, in both English and Chinese for his appreciative parishioners. His work among them and his respect for local customs soon earn him their respect. Anne becomes uncomfortable as she is attracted to him. Beryl suggests to her husband that Anne be sent back to the United States, but he refuses to consider it, needing her at the hospital. Beryl suggests that O'Shea consult with Reverend Martin, a Protestant minister at another American mission, for advice. He agrees. When O'Shea meets Martin (Robert Burton), he makes a startling, unsolicited confession. He says he is not a Catholic priest, but Jim Carmody, an American pilot who had flown supplies over The Hump during World War II. He crashed during the war and was rescued by a local warlord, General Yang (Lee J. Cobb), becoming his trusted second-in-command ... and his prisoner. When one of Yang's soldiers killed Father O'Shea, Carmody deserted and decided to masquerade as the replacement priest. After recounting his story to Martin, Carmody writes a full account to the Catholic bishop. General Yang tracks down Carmody, bringing an army and insisting that Carmody resume serving him. Carmody proposes they settle the matter with their customary game of dice, wagering five years of loyal service against his freedom and the safety of the local villagers. After Yang loses, he coerces Carmody into playing again, this time for the future of the Protestant mission. When he loses again, Yang resigns himself to perpetuating the myth of Father O'Shea, who is saintly enough to turn aside a powerful warlord. Before Carmody leaves the mission, he tells Anne the truth. Cast * Humphrey Bogart as James Carmody * Gene Tierney as Anne Scott * Lee J. Cobb as Mieh Yang * Agnes Moorehead as Beryl Sigman * E. G.

Particularly the tense sequence in which Bogart actually wins the village's freedom by casting dice with Cobb.\\" Harrison's Reports agreed that the dice game was \\"rather fanciful\\", but called the film's production values \\"first-rate\\" and thought that Bogart did \\"an outstanding job\\" in the lead role. John McCarten of The New Yorker deemed the film \\"a fairly substantial item\\" in a positive review, with Bogart doing \\"a fine job\\" in his estimation though he found the plot to get \\"a bit shaky, and even outlandish.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote that Bogart was \\"far more sure of the part than the writers, director and producer seem to be about the rest of the picture.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \\"Obscure character motivation and an unpleasant mock religiosity in the worst Hollywood tradition are the main drawbacks in this curious picture. One suspects that the original novel may have provided more detailed and logical characterisation than is apparent in the film's script‚ÄîCarmody's allegiance to the Chinese warlord is never satisfactorily explained‚Äîand Bogart's tired and uneasy playing fails to suggest the character's dilemma.\\" See also *List of American films of 1955 ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1955 films Category:1955 drama films Category:1955 romantic drama films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:Films about Catholicism Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Edward Dmytryk Category:Films set in 1947 Category:Films set in China Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films scored by Victor Young ","title":"The Left Hand of God"},{"id":"4131845","title":"Frankford Transportation Center"},{"id":"4131849","text":"The lira was the currency of the mainland part of the Kingdom of the Sicily, known as the Kingdom of Naples, between 1812 and 1813.

Background Schultz was born in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents were of Norwegian ancestry, and her father was a well-known painter who had studied at the Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture in Paris, France. When Schultz was eight, her father obtained a commission to paint the king and queen of W√ºrttemberg in Germany and the family moved to Europe. After completing the royal commission, Schultz's father continued to receive requests for portrait painting and decided to stay in Europe, establishing a studio in Paris. Sigrid attended lyc√©e -- the French equivalent of American high school education -- and subsequently studied international law at the Sorbonne, graduating in 1914. She taught French and English in Berlin for much of World War I. Some sources claim that while in Germany with her mother, she fell ill with what was believed to be tuberculosis, leading her to be forced to remain in Germany during World War I; however, Schultz herself (Schultz, p.viii) wrote that she remained in Germany due to her parents' illness, and that around this period she also studied history and international law at Berlin University (Schultz, p.viii). (Her obituary in the Chicago Tribune said that she was \\"a student at Berlin University training to be an opera singer.\\") Career At war's end, Colonel Robert R. McCormick, owner and publisher of the Chicago Tribune, needed a correspondent fluent in both German and English. Among other things, McCormick wanted someone able with the ability to explain in detail the Battle of Jutland, the war's most significant naval battle, to Tribune readers. Schultz joined the Tribune in 1919 and, with fluency in several languages to her credit, became the chief for Central Europe in 1926. She had been named the chief of the Berlin bureau for the Tribune late in 1925. It is believed that Schultz was the first woman to ever hold such a position for a major news media organization. Convinced by events that National Socialism would become a significant force in Germany, Schultz sought interviews with leading members of the Nazi movement, establishing at an early date an acquaintance with then-Captain Hermann G√∂ring, who was later to become Nazi Germany's highest-ranking leader behind Adolf Hitler. Though personally repelled by Nazism, Schultz cultivated her connections with G√∂ring and with other leading Nazis, strengthening her access to these authoritative news sources, as the Nazis gained control of Germany and, later, as Europe moved toward war. Schultz interviewed Adolf Hitler several times and her firsthand knowledge of Germany's leaders helped her to accurately report their intentions and goals, as Nazi Germany's ambitions posed an increasing threat to world peace. Beginning in 1938, Schultz began to report for the Mutual Broadcasting System along with the Chicago Tribune. In doing so, she became \\"the first woman to broadcast regularly on an American network from Europe.\\" She was considered by some of her fellow reporters as only a fair writer but a superb investigator and reporter. Fellow Berlin correspondent William L. Shirer wrote that \\"No other American correspondent in Berlin knew so much of what was going on behind the scenes as did Sigrid Schultz.\\" Though Nazi German officials were often displeased with Schultz's reporting -- which they deemed as critical of the regime -- she had not been expelled from Germany as had other reporters deemed \\"hostile\\" to the nation's \\"revival\\" under Nazism. In order not to jeopardize her ability to work in Germany without imprisonment or expulsion, Schultz during 1938 and 1939 filed some of her dispatches under a pseudonym. Published in the Tribune's weekly magazine under the fictitious name \\"John Dickson,\\" Schultz filed her dispatches from outside Germany -- usually from Oslo or Copenhagen -- with false datelines. These articles reported on the attacks the German government made on the nation's churches, exposed the concentration camps and the increasing persecution of Germany's Jews. In one of these dispatches, Dickson asserted that Germany was prepared for war and predicted the Munich Agreement that gave Hitler free rein to march into Czechoslovakia. On July 13, 1939, one of Dickson's articles received front-page placement in the Tribune. The dispatch forecast the non-aggression pact that took place between Germany and the Soviet Union five weeks later. Writing as Dickson, Schultz reported that \\"Supporters of the theory of Nazi- Soviet cooperation claim that plans for a new partition of Poland, dividing it between Germany and Russia, have been concluded.\\" It was Schultz who awoke CBS reporter William L. Shirer on the morning of the German invasion of Poland, September 1, 1939. Shirer's Berlin Diary recounts the events of that morning. :Berlin, September 1 :At six a.m., Sigrid Schultz -- bless her heart -- phoned. She said: \\"It's happened.\\" I was very sleepy -- my body and mind numbed, paralyzed. I mumbled: \\"Thanks, Sigrid,\\" and tumbled out of bed. :The war is on! Schultz reported on the many military triumphs of the Wehrmacht during the first year of World War II, but was not permitted to travel to the front because she was a woman. She left Germany after being injured in an Allied air raid on Berlin. While in Spain, she developed typhus and returned to the United States in early 1941. What had been expected to be a brief leave developed into a three-year convalescence from the disease. During this period, Schultz wrote a book about Germany titled Germany Will Try It Again and made a nationwide lecture tour about her quarter-century in Germany. Schultz returned to Europe as a war correspondent in January, 1945 and accompanied the U.S. Army on the advance of the Allied armies into Germany. Schultz was also one of the first journalists to visit Buchenwald and she reported on the Nuremberg Trial. After the war, she continued her reporting and wrote several books. Schultz was working on a history of anti-semitism in Germany when she died in 1980. (Her obituary in the Chicago Tribune said that she was \\"working on a book that was to be a history of the two World Wars and the Holocaust.\\")  Schultz's writings  In Schultz's book Germany Will Try It Again, she describes, based on her first-hand witness reports on what is in essence would equate with a German-Austrian 'Military-Industrial Complex' composed of wealthy landowners (Junkers), bankers, and corporate businessmen (of companies still thriving today), who fired World War I, then planned a comeback despite defeat in 1918, propped up Hitler, were planning a comeback in 1944 (ultimately leading to the formation of Die Spinne and ODESSA (detailed in writings of Glenn Infield, Joseph Wechsberg, and Simon Wiesenthal), as well as the Vatican Rat Line to South America and the harboring of Nazi officers in the USA after 1945 (Infield, pp. 245‚Äì246). This true German corporate/banking elite class (obviously excluding Jews) had planned a Central European Empire (Mitteleuropa) that would subjugate Slavs to the German nation, and would restore the greatness of both the Habsburg Austrian Empire and the earlier so-called 'Holy Roman Empire.' Schultz often refers to the Nazi's skill at 'war-in-peace' which bears striking resemblances to the post-1945 'Cold War,' and may well have served as its roots. Schultz also covers the successful appeal of the Nazis to both British and American corporations to ally themselves with Germany in a fight against Communism. While not so successful in Britain, alliances were successful with American corporate investors such as Prescott Bush. Nazi agents in the USA promoted the 'German American Bund', the roots of many current neo-Nazi groups, and sought to provoke divisive American racial tensions through support of other American racist organizations. Lastly, Schultz covers the Nazi drive to build up business and political alliances in South America (Schultz, p. 2, p. 203), which led to the foundations of the Per√≥n regime in Argentina, the Stroessner regime in Paraguay, and the more recent Pinochet regime in Chile.

Abashidze-Gorlenko family coat of arms. The Abashidze () is a Georgian family and a former princely house. Appearing in the 15th century, they achieved prominence in the Kingdom of Imereti in western Georgia in the late 17th century and branched out in the eastern Georgian kingdoms of Kakheti and Kartli as well as the then-Ottoman-held southwestern region of Adjara. After the Russian annexation of Georgian polities, the family was confirmed as Knyaz Abashidze () by the Tsar‚Äôs decree of 1825.  History  The Abashidze family possibly derived from the medieval Georgian noble house of Liparitid-Orbeliani, but the family legend holds that it descended from an AbyssinianBagrationi, Ioane (1768-1830). Abashidze. The Brief Description of the Georgian Noble Houses. Retrieved on January 16, 2010 officer named Abash who had allegedly accompanied Marwan ibn Muhammad‚Äôs Arab army to Georgia in the 8th century; Abash is said to have remained in Georgia and ennobled when he saved the life of a Georgian crown prince from a wolf. The first recorded account about the Abashidze dates back to the latter part of the 15th century. By the 1540s, they had already been in possession of a sizeable fiefdom within the Kingdom of Imereti located in its eastern part and called Saabashidzeo (·É°·Éê·Éê·Éë·Éê·É®·Éò·É´·Éî·Éù; literally, \\"[the land] of Abashidze\\"). The family reached a climax of its might at the turn of the 18th century, when it possessed 78 villages, several castles, fortresses, churches and monasteries as well as 1,500 serf households. Prince Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze was not only the most powerful vassal of the crown of Imereti, but himself acted as a kingmaker and even de facto king from 1702 to 1707. The family branched out in eastern Georgia when Erekle II, King of Kartli and Kakheti, granted, in 1774, to his father-in-law Prince Zaal Abashidze and his male descendants estates in Kakheti. A branch had also been established in Kartli in the person of Vakhushti Abashidze. Earlier in the 18th century, one representative of the Imeretian line went over to the Ottoman government and settled at Batumi where his descendants attained to the office of sanjak-bey. The Russian annexation of Imereti in 1810 brought the princedom of Saabashidzeo to an end. Henceforth, the family was equated to other noble families of the Russian Empire and confirmed as princes on September 20, 1825. On July 29, 1876, Prince Simon Abashidze (1837‚Äì1891) was granted the right to assume the surname and coat of arms of his father-in-law, the late Ukrainian nobleman Semen Davydovych Gorlenko, for himself and his male-line descendants (Abashidze- Gorlenko, –ê–±–∞—à–∏–¥–∑–µ-–ì–æ—Ä–ª–µ–Ω–∫–æ), but he died without a male heir.

The accident leaves Cassie racked with guilt and emotionally vulnerable to the point that she begins hallucinating strange visions and waking-dreams, even though Cassie's friends Annabel (Eliza Dushku) and Matt (Wes Bentley), as well as a local priest called Father Jude (Luke Wilson), all attempt to assist her in coping with the loss. Plot Cassie and Sean, as well as ex-boyfriend Matt and good friend Annabel, go to a club situated in an old church. There Cassie sees a man with a clear, plastic mask (Carl Paoli) and an imposing man with a scarred face (Ken Moreno). Deathmask tries to grab her on the dance floor, but she pushes him away and steps outside the club with Sean. In the parking lot, Matt eavesdrops on their conversation. Sean confesses his love for Cassie, who claims she feels the same way. When Sean returns to the club, Matt convinces Cassie to give him a last 'goodbye' kiss. Sean sees this, and reacts badly to it, giving Cassie the silent treatment as they drive off. Cassie, who is behind the wheel, continually looks away from the road until the car crashes. Cassie's next memory is of being rushed to the hospital; Matt and Annabel are unharmed, but Sean has been killed on impact. During the school term that follows, Cassie has several visions of Sean. She also has visions of Deathmask and Hideous Dancer in the company of Matt and Annabel. On several occasions, she believes she is being chased by the two men, although Annabel and Matt assure her that the incidents are all in her mind. After one chase, Cassie faints and is rescued by Father Jude, a young priest who is sympathetic to her fears and offers to listen if she ever needs someone to talk to. A few nights later, after being chased again, Cassie knocks at the church door, and Father Jude gives her sanctuary. He gives her an amulet depicting St Jude and allows her to sleep in his small room in the church. Upon awakening that morning, Cassie sees that the calendar in the room reads 1981. She enters the office of the attending priest (Rick Snyder) and asks to speak to Father Jude but is told that Father Jude died in 1981. After a swim competition in which she has been made to participate, Cassie is chased by Deathmask. Defending herself with the tube of a fluorescent lamp, she ends up stabbing him in the stomach but when Cassie returns with Matt, they find there is no body in the pool. Even though she believes that Matt and Annabel are conspiring against her with Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, Cassie requests that Matt take her home to her mother. Instead he drives Cassie to the club, saying that he wishes to pick up Annabel. Cassie follows him but gets lost, eventually finding Annabel with a new lover called Raven (Angela Featherstone). When Raven tells Cassie to \\"leave or die\\" Cassie exits the club and makes her way back to the parking lot. There Matt drunkenly insists on another 'goodbye forever' kiss, but Cassie smashes a bottle on his head knocking him unconscious before pushing him from the car and driving away. In a scene resembling the original accident, Cassie wrecks the car. She again comes to in the hospital. On a gurney next to her is Raven, who speaks a few words of comfort before dying. Father Jude arrives and asks if she would be willing to die in order to save Sean's life. She agrees and he then asks her if she would be willing to live for him. Cassie says that she doesn't want to die. An episode follows in which Deathmask and Hideous Dancer strangle her with her protective medallion, from which Cassie wakes to find that everything she has experienced has been a sort of coma-dream: in the original accident, Cassie and Sean had survived, while Matt and Annabel were killed. The occupants of the other car ‚Äî Raven, Deathmask, and Hideous Dancer ‚Äî were also fatally injured. Cassie has spent the course of the film in an astral state, wherein those who were killed in the accident attempt to keep her with them. Father Jude, and Cassie's visions of Sean were what brought her back to life.

The book was written when Kinsella attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and decided to incorporate the stories he told about the Black Sox Scandal, imagining if Shoeless Joe Jackson came back to the same city Kinsella was living in, Iowa City.\\"The 'Field of Dreams' Scrapbook\\", Field of Dreams DVD Plot Ray Kinsella lives and farms in Iowa where he grows corn with his wife Annie and their five-year-old daughter Karin. Kinsella is obsessed with the beauty and history of American baseball, specifically the plight of his hero, Shoeless Joe Jackson, and the Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 World Series. When he hears a voice telling him to build a baseball field in the midst of his corn crop in order to give his hero a chance at redemption, he blindly follows instructions. The field becomes a conduit to the spirits of baseball legends. Soon, Kinsella is off on a cross-country trip to ease the pain of another hero, the reclusive writer J.D.

In 2011, the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame awarded Kinsella the Jack Graney Award for a significant contribution to the game of baseball in Canada through a life's work or a singular outstanding achievement. Film adaptation Shoeless Joe was later adapted into the 1989 film Field of Dreams by Phil Alden Robinson. The original working title of the film was Shoeless Joe, like the book. The original title of the book was Dream Field, but the publisher renamed it Shoeless Joe. J.D. Salinger W.P. Kinsella, who had never met Salinger, created a wholly imagined character (aside from his being a recluse) based on the author of The Catcher in the Rye, a book that had great meaning to him when he was a young man. To get a feel for Salinger, he re-read his body of work. \\"I made sure to make him a nice character so that he couldn't sue me.\\" In addition to having a character named \\"Ray Kinsella\\" in the short story \\"A Young Girl in 1941 with No Waist at All\\", Salinger had also used the surname in The Catcher in the Rye (Holden Caulfield's friend Richard Kinsella). Known for his litigiousness, Salinger contacted Kinsella's publisher via his attorneys to express outrage over having been portrayed in Shoeless Joe and intimated he would sue should the character \\"J.D. Salinger\\" appear in any other medium, should Shoeless Joe be adapted. In the novel Shoeless Joe, Ray Kinsella seeks out J. D. Salinger, although in the film this character was renamed Terence Mann (and was changed to a black man by the casting of James Earl Jones) as the movie producers were worried over being sued by Salinger. The producers believed that it was not significant to jettison Salinger, as they figured only 15% of the potential audience would know who the author was. Kinsella told Maclean's Magazine in a 2010 interview on the death of Salinger that many of the book's readers believe that Salinger is a wholly fictional character. Kinsella denied that Salinger, as a writer, had any particular influence on his own writing.

He was the first judge from a United Kingdom jurisdiction to sit on the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, later becoming its president. Early life Jack Mackenzie- Stuart, as he was widely known, was born in Aberdeen; his father was Prof A. MacKenzie-Stuart, a King's Counsel and Professor of Scots Law at Aberdeen University. His mother was Amy Margaret Dean. Mackenzie Stuart was educated at Fettes College,Distinguished Old Fettesians before studying at Cambridge University. Early career In 1942, Mackenzie Stuart joined the British Army, becoming commissioned in Royal Engineers and went up to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on the War Office Engineering Course, followed by service, mainly building bridges, in Northern Europe. In his speech on retirement from the Court of Justice in 1988, he spoke of the indelible effect at an impressionable age of seeing the ashes of the Ruhr. After a staff post in Burma and a spell dismantling mines on the Northumbrian coast, he returned to Cambridge University where he resumed his Law studies, taking first class honours in Part II of the Law Tripos in 1949, followed by an LL.B. with distinction at Edinburgh in 1951. QC and Sheriff Mackenzie Stuart was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1951 and quickly acquired a substantial practice, being appointed as Queen's Counsel in 1963. In those days there was no specialisation and he was equally at home in the realms of trusts (on which his father had written the standard textbook), taxation and estate duty (as Counsel to the Revenue) and coal-mining accidents. In 1971 he was appointed Sheriff of Aberdeen and it was not long before he was appointed a Senator of the College of Justice, with the judicial title Lord Mackenzie Stuart. He was then appointed, with effect from January 1973, as a Judge of the European Court. The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary agreed that one of the posts in Luxembourg - Judge or Advocate General - would go to a Scots lawyer. Mackenzie-Stuart's taste for European law had been whetted by his wife who studied for an LL.M. with Professor John Mitchell, and he was asked at an early stage whether he would like to be Advocate General. The judgeship was meanwhile offered to senior lawyers in London. European Court of Justice Mackenzie-Stuart was unexpectedly offered the post of Judge at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The Mackenzie-Stuarts moved to Luxembourg and set up home in a farming village where they quickly became part of its life. They worked hard to build up the spirit of the embryo British community and his wife, Anne, became a driving force in the European School. The Court of Justice was dominated by Robert Lecourt. With Jean-Pierre Warner, the Advocate General, Mackenzie-Stuart worked to overcome suspicions and engineer the synchromesh of potentially incompatible legal systems which has continued to work ever since. In reality, the work of the European Court touches very little on the historical differences between the common law and the civil law, and much more on the modern problems of ensuring cross-frontier freedom to trade and to work, market regulation and fair competition. President of the Court of Justice He was later elected by the College of Judges as the seventh president of the court ‚Äì an office he neither sought nor wanted. He took over the presidency at a difficult time. By failing to nominate new judges, some governments were holding up the work of the court, whose workload was growing exponentially. Greece had joined in 1981, followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986, taking the number of official languages from six to nine. The court building (\\"the rusty Palais\\" opened in 1972) was already too small, and some of the translators were working in prefabricated huts. Through quiet persistence with judges, staff, community institutions and national governments, the president ensured that the work got done, a new building was planned and the foundations were laid for a new court structure, involving the creation of a Court of First Instance. Later life In recognition of his contribution to the work of the Court of Justice and to community law, he was created a Life Peer on 18 October 1988 as Baron Mackenzie-Stuart, of Dean in the district of the City of Edinburgh (his peerage, unlike his surname and Scottish judicial title, was hyphenated). Family His wife, the former Anne Burtholme Millar (died 2008), was known for her legendary parties, both in Edinburgh and Luxembourg. The Mackenzie Stuarts had four daughters, all of whom survived both their parents. Anne Mackenzie-Stuart shone in her own right as chairperson of the Parent-Teacher Association of the European School in Luxembourg.

It consists of both a metro station (serving lines 1 and 5) and a premetro (underground tram) station (serving lines 3 and 4). The station opened on 17 December 1969, as a premetro station on the tram line between De Brouck√®re and Schuman, and it also became a heavy metro station in 1976, serving former lines 1A and 1B. Following the reorganisation of the Brussels metro on 4 April 2009, it is served by lines 1 and 5, which cross Brussels from east to west. History The station was inaugurated on 17 December 1969 as a premetro station (i.e. a station served by underground tramways), part of the first underground line in Belgium, then going from De Brouck√®re to Schuman. On 20 September 1976, the premetro line was converted into a heavy metro line, which was later split into two distinct lines on 6 October 1982: former lines 1A and 1B, both serving De Brouck√®re. Since 4 October 1976, De Brouck√®re has also been served by the North‚ÄìSouth Axis, which is part of the premetro system. Lines 3 and 4 provide most service on that axis. On 4 April 2009, metro operation was restructured so that lines 1 and 5 now serve the station. Area The station is named after De Brouck√®re Square, the city square above ground, itself named after the former mayor of the City of Brussels, Charles de Brouck√®re. The station lies near the famous Hotel Metropole, the UGC De Brouck√®re cinema, the Royal Theatre of La Monnaie and one end of Rue Neuve/Nieuwstraat, Belgium's second busiest shopping street.. The whole complex is also connected to the underground shopping galleries between the / and Boulevard Anspach/Anspachlaan. Station De Brouck√®re premetro station The moving walkway connecting the premetro station with the metro station The premetro station, located under De Brouck√®re Square, is connected to the metro station by a moving walkway. The metro station is located under / and was renovated in 2005. The metro station serving lines 1 and 5 is known to have one of the widest gaps between the metro trains and the platform, as this station is curved to follow the alignment between the neighbouring Central Station and Sainte-Catherine/Sint- Katelijne metro station. For safety reasons, the curved platform edges are equipped with flashing lights to warn passengers of the gap. In 2004, a mural titled The City Moves in the Palm of My Hand was installed along the station's moving walkway. The mural was created by artist Jan Vanriet and is printed on finished edge panels from PolyVision. The mural is designed to reflect the city's vibrancy and historical background.

This was historically offered as an alternative to Darwinism. Some forms of mutationism were effectively saltationist, implying large discontinuous jumps. Speciation, such as by polyploidy in plants, can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step. Evidence exists for various forms of saltation in a variety of organisms. History Prior to Charles Darwin most evolutionary scientists had been saltationists.Henry Fairfield Osborn. (1894). From the Greeks to Darwin: An outline of the development of the evolution idea. New York, London, Macmillan and Co. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was a gradualist but similar to other scientists of the period had written that saltational evolution was possible. √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that \\"monstrosities could become the founding fathers (or mothers) of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next.\\"Benedikt Hallgr√≠msson, Brian K. Hall. (2011). Variation: A Central Concept in Biology.

Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations Volume 1. University of Chicago Press. p. 10 With the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859 Charles Darwin had denied saltational evolution by writing that evolutionary transformation always proceeds gradually and never in jumps. Darwin insisted on slow accumulation of small steps in evolution and wrote \\"natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short steps\\". Darwin continued in this belief throughout his life.Charles Darwin. (1859). On the Origin of Species. p. 471 From 1860 to 1880 saltation had a minority interest but by 1890 had become a major interest to scientists.Gregory Radick. (2008).

In the early 20th century a mechanism of saltation was proposed as large mutations. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo de Vries, who along with Carl Correns helped rediscover Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance in 1900, William Bateson, a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career Thomas Hunt Morgan. Some of these geneticists developed it into the mutation theory of evolution.Peter J. Bowler. (2003). Evolution: The History of an Idea. University of California Press. pp. 265‚Äì270 There was also a debate over accounts of the evolution of mimicry and if they could be explained by gradualism or saltation. The geneticist Reginald Punnett supported a saltational theory in his book Mimicry in Butterflies (1915).Reginald Punnett. (1915). Mimicry in Butterflies. Cornell University Library. The mutation theory of evolution held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. This mutationist view of evolution was later replaced by the reconciliation of Mendelian genetics with natural selection into a gradualistic framework for the neo-Darwinian synthesis.Peter J. Bowler. (2003). Evolution: The History of an Idea. University of California Press. It was the emergence of population thinking in evolution which forced many scientists to adopt gradualism in the early 20th century. According to Ernst Mayr, it wasn't until the development of population genetics in the neo- Darwinian synthesis in the 1940s that demonstrated the explanatory power of natural selection that saltational views of evolution were largely abandoned.Ernst Mayr. (2007). What Makes Biology Unique?: Considerations on the Autonomy of a Scientific Discipline. Cambridge University Press; 1 edition Saltation was originally denied by the \\"modern synthesis\\" school of neo- Darwinism which favoured gradual evolution but has since been accepted due to recent evidence in evolutionary biology (see the current status section).Bateman, R. M. and DiMichele, W. A. (1994). Saltational evolution of form in vascular plants: a neoGoldschmidtian synthesis. In Shape and Form in Plants and Fungi (eds D. S. Ingram and A.

In recent years there are some prominent proponents of saltation, including Carl Woese. Woese, and colleagues, suggested that the absence of RNA signature continuum between domains of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya constitutes a primary indication that the three primary organismal lineages materialized via one or more major evolutionary saltations from some universal ancestral state involving dramatic change in cellular organization that was significant early in the evolution of life, but in complex organisms gave way to the generally accepted Darwinian mechanisms.Roberts, E., A. Sethi, J. Montoya, C.R. Woese and Z. Luthey-Schulten. (2008). Molecular signatures of ribosomal evolution. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 105: 13953‚Äì13958. The geneticist Barbara McClintock introduced the idea of \\"jumping genes\\", chromosome transpositions that can produce rapid changes in the genome.McClintock, B. (1984). The significance of responses of the genome to challenge. Science Vol. 226, pp. 792-801. Saltational speciation, also known as abrupt speciation, is the discontinuity in a lineage that occurs through genetic mutations, chromosomal aberrations or other evolutionary mechanisms that cause reproductively isolated individuals to establish a new species population. Polyploidy, karyotypic fission, symbiogenesis and lateral gene transfer are possible mechanisms for saltational speciation.Oladele Ogunseitan. (2004). Microbial Diversity: Form and Function in Prokaryotes. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 13. Macromutation theory The botanist John Christopher Willis proposed an early saltationist theory of evolution. He held that species were formed by large mutations, not gradual evolution by natural selection.J. C. Willis. (1923). The Origin of Species by Large, rather than by Gradual, Change, and by Guppy's Method of Differentiation. Annals of Botany. Vol. 37, No. 148. pp. 605-628.J. M. Beal. (1941). The Course of Evolution by J. C. Willis. Botanical Gazette, Vol. 102, No. 3. p. 638. The German geneticist Richard Goldschmidt was the first scientist to use the term \\"hopeful monster\\". Goldschmidt thought that small gradual changes could not bridge the hypothetical divide between microevolution and macroevolution. In his book The Material Basis of Evolution (1940) he wrote \\"the change from species to species is not a change involving more and more additional atomistic changes, but a complete change of the primary pattern or reaction system into a new one, which afterwards may again produce intraspecific variation by micromutation.\\" Goldschmidt believed the large changes in evolution were caused by macromutations (large mutations). His ideas about macromutations became known as the hopeful monster hypothesis which is considered a type of saltational evolution.Verne Grant. (1963). The Origin of Adaptations. Columbia University Press. Goldschmidt's thesis however was universally rejected and widely ridiculed within the biological community, which favored the neo-Darwinian explanations of R.A. Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright.Gould, S. J. (1982). \\"The uses of heresey; an introduction to Richard Goldschmidt's The Material Basis of Evolution.\\" pp. xiii-xlii. New Haven: Yale University Press. However, there has been a recent interest in the ideas of Goldschmidt in the field of evolutionary developmental biology as some scientists are convinced he was not entirely wrong.Scott F. Gilbert. (2000). Developmental Biology Sinauer Associates; 6th edition. Otto Schindewolf, a German paleontologist, also supported macromutations as part of his evolutionary theory. He was known for presenting an alternative interpretation of the fossil record based on his ideas of orthogenesis, saltational evolution and extraterrestrial impacts opposed to gradualism but abandoned the view of macromutations in later publications.Otto Schindewolf. (1969). √úber den ‚ÄúTypus‚Äù in morphologischer und phylogenetischer Biologie. Mainz: Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur. S√∏ren L√∏vtrup, a biochemist and embryologist from Denmark, advocated a similar hypothesis of macromutation to Goldschmidt's in 1974.Kathryn E. Hood, Carolyn Tucker Halpern and Gary Greenberg. (2010). Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 70 Lovtrup believed that macromutations interfered with various epigenetic processes, that is, those which affect the causal processes in biological development. This is in contrast to the gradualistic theory of micromutations of Neo-Darwinism, which claims that evolutionary innovations are generally the result of accumulation of numerous very slight modifications. Lovtrup also rejected the punctuated equilibria of Stephen Gould and Niles Eldredge, claiming it was a form of gradualism and not a macromutation theory. Lovtrup defended many of Darwin's critics including Schindewolf, Mivart, Goldschmidt, and Himmelfarb.Review of Lovtrup's book in the New Scientist, Oct 15, 1988 Mae Wan Ho described Lovtrup's theory as similar to the hopeful monster theory of Richard Goldschmidt. Goldschmidt presented two mechanisms for how hopeful monsters might work. One mechanism, involved ‚Äúsystemic mutations‚Äù, rejected the classical gene concept and is no longer considered by modern science; however, his second mechanism involved ‚Äúdevelopmental macromutations‚Äù in ‚Äúrate genes‚Äù or ‚Äúcontrolling genes‚Äù that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. These kind of mutations are similar to the ones considered in contemporary evolutionary developmental biology.Guenter Theissen. (2010). Homeosis of the angiosperm flower: Studies on three candidate cases of saltational evolution. Palaeodiversity 3, Supplement: 131-139.

According to the article \\"Single-gene changes that confer a large adaptive value do happen: they are not rare, they are not doomed and, when competing with small-effect mutations, they tend to win.

A paper by (Page et al. 2010) have written that the Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) could be classified as a hopeful monster as it exhibits an adaptive and derived mode of development that has evolved rapidly and independently among tiger salamanders.

American biologist Michael Freeling has proposed \\"balanced gene drive\\" as a saltational mechanism in the mutationist tradition, which could explain trends involving morphological complexity in plant and animal eukaryotic lineages.Freeling M, Thomas BC.

Bias in plant gene content following different sorts of duplication: tandem, whole-genome, segmental, or by transposition. Annu Rev Plant Biol 60: 433‚Äì453. Current status=Known mechanisms Examples of saltational evolution include cases of stabilized hybrids that can reproduce without crossing (such as allotetraploids) and cases of symbiogenesis. Both gene duplication and lateral gene transfer have the capacity to bring about relatively large changes that are saltational.Serres MH, Kerr AR, McCormack TJ, Riley M. (2009).Evolution by leaps: gene duplication in bacteria. Biology Direct 4: 46. Polyploidy (most common in plants but not unknown in animals) is saltational: a significant change (in gene numbers) can result in speciation in a single generation.

There has been a controversy over whether mimicry in butterflies and other insects can be explained by gradual or saltational evolution.Olof Leimar, Birgitta S. Tullberg and James Mallet. Mimicry, Saltational Evolution, and the Crossing of Fitness Valleys. In E. I. Svensson & R. Calsbeek eds. (2012). The Adaptive Landscape in Evolutionary Biology. Oxford University Press. According to Norrstr√∂m (2006) there is evidence for saltation in some cases of mimicry.Norrstr√∂m, N., Getz, W. M., & Holmgren, N. M. A. (2006). Coevolution of exploiter specialization and victim mimicry can be cyclic and saltational. Evolutionary Bioinformatics Online. 2: 35-43. The endosymbiotic theory is considered to be a type of saltational evolution.Michael Syvanen, Clarence I. Kado. (2002). Horizontal Gene Transfer Academic Press. p. 405.

The mode of pheromone evolution: evidence from bark beetles. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 271: 839‚Äì846.

It has been suggested (Carr, 1980, 2000) that the Calycadenia pauciflora could have originated directly from an ancestral race through a single saltational event involving multiple chromosome breaks.Carr, G.

Specific cases of homeosis in flowers can be caused by saltational evolution. In a study of divergent orchid flowers (Bateman and DiMichele, 2002) wrote how simple homeotic morphs in a population can lead to newly established forms that become fixed and ultimately lead to new species.Bateman RM, WA DiMichele.

Explanations Reviewing the history of macroevolutionary theories, the American evolutionary biologist Douglas J. Futuyma notes that since 1970, two very different alternatives to Darwinian gradualism have been proposed, both by Stephen Jay Gould: mutationism, and punctuated equilibria.Gould, S. J. (1980) Is a new and general theory of evolution emerging? Paleobiology 6:119‚Äì130 Gould's macromutation theory gave a nod to his predecessor with an envisaged \\"Goldschmidt break\\" between evolution within a species and speciation.

It occurs when loose materials are removed from a bed and carried by the fluid, before being transported back to the surface. Examples include pebble transport by rivers, sand drift over desert surfaces, soil blowing over fields, and snow drift over smooth surfaces such as those in the Arctic or Canadian Prairies. Process At low fluid velocities, loose material rolls downstream, staying in contact with the surface. This is called creep or reptation. Here the forces exerted by the fluid on the particle are only enough to roll the particle around the point of contact with the surface. Once the wind speed reaches a certain critical value, termed the impact or fluid threshold, the drag and lift forces exerted by the fluid are sufficient to lift some particles from the surface. These particles are accelerated by the fluid, and pulled downward by gravity, causing them to travel in roughly ballistic trajectories. If a particle has obtained sufficient speed from the acceleration by the fluid, it can eject, or splash, other particles in saltation, which propagates the process. Depending on the surface, the particle could also disintegrate on impact, or eject much finer sediment from the surface. In air, this process of saltation bombardment creates most of the dust in dust storms. In rivers, this process repeats continually, gradually eroding away the river bed, but also transporting-in fresh material from upstream. The speed at which the flow can move particles by saltation is given by the Bagnold formula. Suspension generally affects small particles ('small' means ~70 micrometres or less for particles in air). For these particles, vertical drag forces due to turbulent fluctuations in the fluid are similar in magnitude to the weight of the particle. These smaller particles are carried by the fluid in suspension, and advected downstream. The smaller the particle, the less important the downward pull of gravity, and the longer the particle is likely to stay in suspension. Saltating dune sand in a wind tunnel. A recent study finds that saltating sand particles induces a static electric field by friction. Saltating sand acquires a negative charge relative to the ground which in turn loosens more sand particles which then begin saltating. This process has been found to double the number of particles predicted by previous theory.Electric Sand Findings, University of Michigan Jan. 6, 2008 This is significant in meteorology because it is primarily the saltation of sand particles which dislodges smaller dust particles into the atmosphere. Dust particles and other aerosols such as soot affect the amount of sunlight received by the atmosphere and earth, and are nuclei for condensation of the water vapour. Sand hitting sand is more likely to stick; sand hitting a more coherent surface is more likely to bounce. This feedback loop helps sand accumulate to create dunes. Avalanches Saltation layers can also form in avalanches.

The episode was directed by Amy Heckerling, her only directing credit for the series. In this episode, Michael (Steve Carell) allows an attractive salesperson (Amy Adams) to sell her purses in the office, catching the eye of almost every male in the office. Meanwhile, Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim (John Krasinski) use the situation to play yet another prank on Dwight (Rainn Wilson). \\"Hot Girl\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode received 4.8 million viewers and received a 2.3 rating/5% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Plot Corporate informs Michael Scott (Steve Carell) that an incentive program has been set up where the top Dunder Mifflin sales representative will be rewarded with a prize of up to $1,000. As Michael decides on choosing that prize, Katy Moore (Amy Adams), a pretty young purse saleswoman, comes into the office to sell her wares. When Michael sees her, he offers to let her set up shop in the conference room, which catches every male's eye. As he shows her around the office, Michael tries to impress her while doing his best to impede the chances of any other office male. Roy Anderson mentions that he would go for her if he were not dating Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and an angry Pam corrects him that they are engaged. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) that he should approach Katy and if all else fails, he should buy a purse, which he does to Pam and Jim's delight. When Michael hears she'll need a ride home, he does his best to offer himself, going so far as to spend the aforementioned $1,000 on an espresso machine to impress her. While Pam is sitting on Jim's desk and talking to him, Roy comes up and tries to apologize to Pam, eventually getting her out of her bad mood by tickling her; an uncomfortable Jim leaves his desk. Later, he strikes up a conversation with Katy, and in the end, she decides to get a ride from Jim, leaving Michael and Dwight devastated. It is revealed that Katy and Jim are also going out for a drink, to the apparent jealousy of Pam. Production \\"Hot Girl\\" introduced the recurring character Katy, played by Amy Adams. \\"Hot Girl\\" was the first episode written by writer and actress Mindy Kaling, who portrays Kelly Kapoor. Kaling became one of the most prolific writers for the series, writing 22 of its episodes. She was later promoted to executive producer of the show for its eighth season. The episode was also the first and only one directed by Amy Heckerling. \\"Hot Girl\\" introduced the recurring role of Katy, portrayed by Amy Adams. Katy would appear in two more episodes: \\"The Fire\\" and \\"Booze Cruise\\". Adams remarked that she thoroughly enjoyed her work on the show. In an interview with The Advocate, she said that The Office \\"was the best work experience. I loved that show and that cast so much. I don't know if they believe me, but every time I see them I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I'll do anything to come back. Several years after she left the show as a recurring character, B. J. Novak wanted to write her a cameo in the seventh season episode \\"Threat Level Midnight\\", but she was unavailable for filming. \\"Hot Girl\\" was one of two first season episodes, the other being \\"Health Care\\", that did not contain commentary by members of the cast and crew on the season DVD. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on April 26, 2005, \\"Hot Girl\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.8 million viewers and received a 2.3/5% rating share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.3% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode, airing after Scrubs, retained only 19% of its lead-in audience. The episode, along with Scrubs, ranked fourth in its timeslot, being beaten by a rerun of the Fox medical drama House which received a 6.3 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, the CBS reality show The Amazing Race which received a 5.1 rating, and ABC, which ran a rerun of the comedy According to Jim and a new episode of the sitcom Rodney, averaging a 3.3 rating. \\"Hot Girl\\" received the lowest rating in the show's history until it was beaten by the season eight episode \\"Tallahassee\\" almost seven years later. After the lackluster reception of the episode, Media Life Magazine erroneously predicted that \\"Hot Girl\\" would also serve as the de facto series finale. Reviews The episode received moderately positive reviews from critics. Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10, signifying a \\"great\\" episode. Fickett wrote that \\"Hot Girl\\" helped to establish what type of character Michael would eventually become in the subsequent seasons, noting the character's \\"deep and desperate loneliness\\" which would eventually become a main conceit in the series. He concluded that the episode ended with a \\"classic Office moment\\"‚ÄîMichael realizing that Jim will be giving Katy a ride home‚Äîthat \\"captures the desperation and loneliness of [Pam, Jim, and Michael] ‚Äì and does a great job of setting the stage for the show's terrific second season.\\" Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B but described it as \\"the weakest of the first season.\\" Alli noted that the episode was largely the \\"play on the same joke,\\" featuring Michael and Dwight \\"making idiots of themselves over Katy.\\" However, she did positively compare the American version of the show to the British version, stating, \\"All things considered, I think the first season is very underrated owing to unnecessary comparisons to the British version,\\" but concluded that the episode was \\"its weak moment.\\" Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\". Adams largely praised Fischer's performance, noting that she \\"helped build her character‚Äôs arc every step of the way\\" in the series and that several of her moments in \\"Hot Girl\\" helped to emphasize this point. Furthermore, he complimented the appearance of Katy, noting that she causes a rift between Pam and Jim, but due to \\"the confidence of Adams‚Äô performance and some hidden compartments in Kaling‚Äôs script\\", she also has \\"legitimate agency\\".

The main part of the collection is a cycle of 20 preludes and fugues in different keys, so Ariadne musica is considered an important precursor to Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, which has a similar structure. The title refers to the Greek myth in which Theseus finds his way out of Minotaur's labyrinth using a ball of thread that Ariadne, daughter of King Minos of Crete, gave him. Similarly, the music in the collection can be said to guide the listener through a labyrinth of keys. Fischer also used Greek mythology to name the pieces in another large scale music collection of his, Musikalischer Parnassus. The first edition of Ariadne musica was made in 1702 in Schlackenwerth. The work was reprinted several times during Fischer's life. The original print mentioned by Johann Gottfried Walther in Musicalisches Lexicon is now lost, but a manuscript copy survives. Pieces 20 preludes and fugues: * Prelude & Fugue No. 1 in C major * Prelude & Fugue No. 2 in C-sharp minor * Prelude & Fugue No. 3 in D minor * Prelude & Fugue No. 4 in D major * Prelude & Fugue No. 5 in E-flat major * Prelude & Fugue No. 6 in E Phrygian * Prelude & Fugue No. 7 in E Dorian * Prelude & Fugue No. 8 in E major * Prelude & Fugue No. 9 in F minor * Prelude & Fugue No. 10 in F major * Prelude & Fugue No. 11 in F-sharp minor * Prelude & Fugue No. 12 in G minor * Prelude & Fugue No. 13 in G major * Prelude & Fugue No. 14 in A-flat major * Prelude & Fugue No. 15 in A minor * Prelude & Fugue No. 16 in A major * Prelude & Fugue No. 17 in B-flat major * Prelude & Fugue No. 18 in B minor * Prelude & Fugue No. 19 in B major * Prelude & Fugue No. 20 in C minor 5 ricercars on chorale melodies, each connected with a specific Catholic event: * Ricercar pro Tempore Adventus, in C major (on Ave Maria klare, for Advent) * Ricercar pro Festis Natalitys, in C major (on Der Tag der ist so freudenreich, for Christmas) * Ricercar pro Tempore Quadragesimae, in A minor (on Da Jesus an dem Kreuze stund, for Lent) * Ricercar pro Festis Paschalibus, in D minor (on Christ ist erstanden, for Easter) * Ricercar pro Festis Pentecostalibus, in F major (on Komm, heiliger Geist, for Pentecost) All pieces are quite short, including a few really brief fugues (the seven bar A minor fugue being the shortest). Most are in common time, with a few exceptions (most notably the E Dorian fugue which is in 12/8). The preludes vary from pieces based on short simplistic toccata-like passages over long sustained chords (as in, for example, the C major and G major ones) to slightly more complex works with brief imitative passages like this one, from the end of the E-flat major prelude: Last 4 bars of the E-flat major prelude from Ariadne musica. The fugues are all in four voices, the only exception being the A-flat major with a fifth part doubling the octave in the last chord. Some are loosely connected thematically to the accompanying preludes. The ricercars all feature themes written in whole and half notes, the C major Ricercar pro Festis Natalitys being one notable exception with the theme composed mostly of quarter and eighth notes. Three are marked alla breve, Ricercar pro Festis Natalitys is in common time and the F major ricercar is in 3/2. Ricercar pro Festis Paschalibus was previously attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach and listed in the BWV catalogue as BWV 746, chorale prelude Christ ist erstanden. Connection with Johann Sebastian Bach The most obvious connection of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier with Ariadne Musica is Bach's use of Fischer's subject in one of the fugues: Opening bars of the E major fugue from Ariadne musica. The six-note subject of the E major four- voice fugue by Fischer (opening bars pictured above, subject highlighted) is used by Bach as the subject of the E major fugue from the second volume of the Well-Tempered Clavier, BWV878/2, also in four voices: The beginning of Bach's E major fugue from the second volume of the Well-Tempered Clavier. Fischer's piece is quite short (although not as short as, for instance, the 8 bar E Phrygian fugue from the same collection) and written predominantly using long note values; Bach's fugue is much more complex, with dense counterpoint and also much longer - although Fischer's subject makes it into one of the few pieces from the WTC that feature a significant amount of whole and half-notes in all voices. The same six-note subject is found in two 17th century keyboard compositions by the famous Johann Jakob Froberger: Fantasia No. 2 and Ricercar No. 4. The latter's opening bars can be seen below (with the inverted version of the same theme shown in dark pink): The opening bars of Froberger's Ricercar No. 4; the six-note theme is shown in blue, its inverted form is shown in dark pink. Fischer might have learned the theme from Froberger. Additionally, Fischer's E-flat major fugue and Bach's G minor fugue from Book 1 share a similar structure concerning the use of countersubjects; the subject of Bach's fugue is a slightly modified version of Fischer's. Both Bach's and Fischer's C major fugues are heavily based on stretto and their subjects are somewhat similar rhythmically.

It has one entrance, at the intersection of Rue Royale/Koningsstraat and Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat, two of the main roads of the City of Brussels. The station opened on 17 December 1969, as a premetro (underground tram) station on the tram line between De Brouck√®re and Schuman, and became a heavy metro station on 20 September 1976, serving former lines 1A and 1B. Following the reorganisation of the Brussels metro on 4 April 2009, it is served by lines 1 and 5, which cross Brussels from east to west. Several places of interest other than the park itself lie near this station: the Royal Palace, the Belgian House of Parliament (Palace of the Nation), the office of the Prime Minister of Belgium, the Royal Park Theatre, and the United States' embassy. History When the station was first built, there was a plan to eventually construct a connecting line along the route of Rue Royale/Koningsstraat. To provide for this line, a much larger underground space was excavated than necessary for a simple station. The Rue Royale line was quickly cancelled, and the underground chambers intended for it now house the Brussels metro's traffic control centre. The tunnel between Parc/Park and Arts-Loi/Kunst-Wet stations was the first section of the Brussels metro system to be built using a tunnelling shield. This was done as a test; most parts of the Brussels metro having been built using open construction methods.

As the heaviest analogue of ammonia (a pnictogen hydride), BiH3 is unstable, decomposing to bismuth metal well below 0 ¬∞C. This compound adopts the expected pyramidal structure with H-Bi-H angles of around 90¬∞. The term bismuthine may also refer to a member of the family of organobismuth(III) species having the general formula , where R is an organic substituent. For example, Bi(CH3)3 is trimethylbismuthine. Preparation and properties BiH3 is prepared by the redistribution of methylbismuthine (BiH2Me):Holleman, A.

Applications and operating-system components can use this centralized log service to report events that have taken place, such as a failure to start a component or to complete an action. In Windows Vista, Microsoft overhauled the event system. Due to the Event Viewer's routine reporting of minor start- up and processing errors (which do not, in fact, harm or damage the computer), the software is frequently used by technical support scammers to trick the victim into thinking that their computer contains critical errors requiring immediate technical support. An example is the \\"Administrative Events\\" field under \\"Custom Views\\" which can have over a thousand errors or warnings logged over a month's time.  Overview  Windows NT has featured event logs since its release in 1993. The Event Viewer uses event IDs to define the uniquely identifiable events that a Windows computer can encounter. For example, when a user's authentication fails, the system may generate Event ID 672. Windows NT 4.0 added support for defining \\"event sources\\" (i.e. the application which created the event) and performing backups of logs. Windows 2000 added the capability for applications to create their own log sources in addition to the three system-defined \\"System\\", \\"Application\\", and \\"Security\\" log-files. Windows 2000 also replaced NT4's Event Viewer with a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in. Windows Server 2003 added the \`AuthzInstallSecurityEventSource()\` API calls so that applications could register with the security-event logs, and write security-audit entries. Versions of Windows based on the Windows NT 6.0 kernel (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008) no longer have a 300-megabyte limit to their total size. Prior to NT 6.0, the system opened on-disk files as memory-mapped files in kernel memory space, which used the same memory pools as other kernel components. Event Viewer log-files with filename extension \`evtx\` typically appear in a directory such as \`C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\winevt\\\\Logs\\\\\`  Command- line interface  Windows XP introduced set of three command-line interface tools, useful to task automation: * \`eventquery.vbs\` ‚Äì Official script to query, filter and output results based on the event logs. Discontinued after XP. * \`eventcreate\` ‚Äì a command (continued in Vista and 7) to put custom events in the logs. * \`eventtriggers\` ‚Äì a command to create event driven tasks. Discontinued after XP, replaced by the \\"Attach task to this event\\" feature.  Windows Vista  Event Viewer consists of a rewritten event tracing and logging architecture on Windows Vista. It has been rewritten around a structured XML log-format and a designated log type to allow applications to more precisely log events and to help make it easier for support technicians and developers to interpret the events. The XML representation of the event can be viewed on the Details tab in an event's properties. It is also possible to view all potential events, their structures, registered event publishers and their configuration using the wevtutil utility, even before the events are fired. There are a large number of different types of event logs including Administrative, Operational, Analytic, and Debug log types. Selecting the Application Logs node in the Scope pane reveals numerous new subcategorized event logs, including many labeled as diagnostic logs. Analytic and Debug events which are high frequency are directly saved into a trace file while Admin and Operational events are infrequent enough to allow additional processing without affecting system performance, so they are delivered to the Event Log service. Events are published asynchronously to reduce the performance impact on the event publishing application. Event attributes are also much more detailed and show EventID, Level, Task, Opcode, and Keywords properties. Users can filter event logs by one or more criteria or by a limited XPath 1.0 expression, and custom views can be created for one or more events. Using XPath as the query language allows viewing logs related only to a certain subsystem or an issue with only a certain component, archiving select events and sending traces on the fly to support technicians.  Filtering using XPath 1.0  # Open Windows Event Log # Expand out Windows Logs # Select the log file that is of interest (In the example below, the Security event log is used) # Right-click on the Event Log and select Filter Current Log... # Change the selected tab from Filter to XML # Check the box to Edit query manually' # Paste the query into the text box. Sample queries can be found below. Here are examples of simple custom filters for the new Window Event Log: # Select all events in the Security Event Log where the account name involved (TargetUserName) is \\"JUser\\" #: \`*[EventData[Data[@Name=\\"TargetUserName\\"]=\\"JUser\\" \` # Select all events in the Security Event Log where any Data node of the EventData section is the string \\"JUser\\" #: \`*[EventData[Data=\\"JUser\\" \` # Select all events in the Security Event Log where any Data node of the EventData section is \\"JUser\\" or \\"JDoe\\" #: \`*[EventData[Data=\\"JUser\\" or Data=\\"JDoe\\" \` # Select all events in the Security Event Log where any Data node of the EventData section is \\"JUser\\" and the Event ID is \\"4471\\" #: \`*[System[EventID=\\"4471\\" and *[EventData[Data=\\"JUser\\" \` #Real-world example for a package called Goldmine which has two @Names #: \`*[System[Provider[@Name='GoldMine' or @Name='GMService' ]\` Caveats: * There are limitations to Microsoft's implementation of XPath * Queries using XPath string functions will result in error  Event subscribers  Major event subscribers include the Event Collector service and Task Scheduler 2.0. The Event Collector service can automatically forward event logs to other remote systems, running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 R2 on a configurable schedule. Event logs can also be remotely viewed from other computers or multiple event logs can be centrally logged and monitored without an agent and managed from a single computer. Events can also be directly associated with tasks, which run in the redesigned Task Scheduler and trigger automated actions when particular events take place.

KATUSA does not form an individual military unit, instead small numbers of KATUSA members are dispatched throughout the most of the Eighth United States Army departments, filling in positions for the United States Army enlisted soldiers and junior non-commissioned officers. KATUSAs are drafted from pool of qualified volunteers who are subjected to mandatory military service for Korean male citizens. While ROK Army holds the responsibility for personnel management of KATUSAs, KATUSA members are equipped with standard United States Army issues, and live and work with the U.S. enlisted soldiers. This kind of augmentation is unique throughout the entire United States Army worldwide, because KATUSA program was developed during Korean War as a temporary measure to cope with a shortage of personnel in the United States Army. Purpose The KATUSA program provides the U.S. military with Korean-speaking soldiers, allowing greater military functionality and maneuverability throughout the Korean peninsula. KATUSA soldiers are assigned to each Eighth United States Army units with their Military Occupational Specialty like the United States Army soldiers and do the part of their MOS. Additionally, KATUSA soldiers serve as translators between the local populace and the U.S. Army, and help the U.S. maneuver in unfamiliar terrain. Informally, they help U.S. soldiers new to the peninsula understand Korean customs and a bit of the language. It saves the U.S. money and manpower, and symbolizes the two nations' friendship and mutual support. The KATUSA program remains essential for the safety of the Republic of Korea, not only for establishing partnerships with American Armed Forces, but to learn from each other and to assist each other, especially with the threat of North Korea looming over South Korea. According to Richard Weiz (2013), author of \\"An Enduring Partnership: South Korea and the United States\\", The North Korean threat continues to provide the fundamental basis for the ROK-U.S. security relationship...The most recent period of tensions flared up after the North's long-range rocket launch in December 2012 and underground nuclear test in February 2013\\" (Pg. 310). See p. 310. Providing valuable information on the peninsula as well as translations, KATUSA soldiers carry out their MOS effectively, allowing for a future of more foreign cooperation with America. Nirav Patel and Lindsey Ford (2009), authors of \\"The future of the U.S.-ROK alliance: global perspectives\\" go on to state that \\"The alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK) has been a key component of America‚Äôs bilateral alliance system in Asia for almost 60 years. South Korea has been a close friend and valued partner during difficult circumstances, even when personal relations between U.S. and ROK leaders were at a low ebb\\" History The KATUSA system was established in July 1950 during the Korean War. It was started as a spoken agreement between President Seungman Lee and U.S. General Douglas MacArthur. At that time, the U.S. Army needed a military force that had the proper knowledge of the geography of Korea, and the abilities to distinguish ally troops (South Korea) from enemy troops (North Korea) and communicate better between U.S. soldiers and Korean soldiers. Therefore, some were drafted to KATUSA by force, and others voluntarily (by their own choice) applied . After training, they were divided into the U.S. military, such as 2nd, 7th, 24th, 25th divisions. During the Korean Wars, a total 43,660 KATUSA soldiers fought for South Korea with U.S. forces. Of these soldiers, 11,365 went missing or were killed in action. This program continued after the Korean War, and KATUSA soldiers would spend 18-months with the U.S. Army learning his occupation and would then return to the ROK Army for training others on the occupation. According to the Eighth Army Wightman NCO Academy, \\"With the establishment of the ROKA Training Center in 1963‚Ä¶KATUSA soldiers began to spend their whole military tour in the U.S. Army\\" KATUSA Code of ConductSelection process To become a KATUSA, eligible Korean draftees who've demonstrated a minimum level of English- language proficiency by achieving minimum passing scores on standardized tests of English (TOEFL and TEPS), may apply through the Military Manpower Administration(MMA), upon which their name is entered into a lottery system. Typically, the minimum scores for getting into the lottery are 780 and over for TOEIC and 690 and over for TEPS. As the selection process is completely random, all eligible candidates have an equal chance of winning. Applicants may only apply once. Qualified Korean draftees who demonstrate a high level of English fluency and aptitude via a standardized written exam (usually the TOEIC) may apply for a KATUSA slot. Conscripts with qualifying test scores are selected on a random basis via lottery by the Korean government. Once selected, KATUSAs must complete six-weeks of ROK Army basic training. A brief orientation and OJT is conducted by the U.S. Army before they begin their full-time duty with a United States Army unit garrisoned in Korea for the duration of their military service. The number of candidates vying for an available opening is extremely high because many soldiers believe that the U.S. Army is less abusive and more professional in its training and treatment of soldiers compared with the ROK Army, and that junior enlisted personnel receive better treatment, have more educational opportunities (especially with regards to learning English), experience a higher standard of living, and have an overall better quality of life than their ROK counterparts. In 2012, roughly 3,400 KATUSA soldiers served with 25,000 United States Forces Korea (USFK), versus 4,800 in 2005 and 11,000 in 1968. Declassified 1 Nov 94 As the number of U.S. soldiers in South Korea decreases, the number of KATUSA soldiers is decreasing as well. The ratio of KATUSA soldiers to U.S. soldiers is roughly 1:10. U.S. Air Force While many Republic of Korea Air Force members in Korea work alongside U.S. Air Force members, there is no KATUSA program with the USAF counterpart; ROKAF retains their own unit and command structure separate from their USAF counterparts. Criticism Because KATUSA program was built as a temporary measure during mid-war and stayed in that way, there has been no legal legitimation for the program in Korean law system to this date. The oral agreement between General MacArthur and President Rhee on conscripting Korean civilians for the U.S. Forces was never documented. Only the memorandum of assigning operational command of ROK Army to General MacArthur by President Rhee, known as Pusan Letter, is considered as an only justification for KATUSA program in South Korea. EUSA designates the state of KATUSA program in Army in Korea Regulation 600-2. Since KATUSA soldiers do not undergo special education for their MOS before their deployment and their mission trainings heavily rely on OJT from senior to junior KATUSAs, new KATUSAs usually take a few months of incubatory period before they can fully perform. KATUSA U.S. Friendship Week, Camp Humphreys, South Korea One criticism of the KATUSA program arises from the difference in promotion systems; the ROK Army promotes its enlistees on a quota/time basis and not through the merit system. A KATUSA soldier may be senior in rank to an American counterpart with significantly more field experience. However, this criticism is usually rebutted by the counter-argument from the United States Forces Korea that such promotion of KATUSA soldiers is sufficiently warranted given the fact that KATUSA soldiers usually possess at least two years of college experience, which would translate to an advanced enlisted rank for US soldiers. Another criticism arising from the Korean Army side is based on the fact that most of the KATUSA soldiers are from the top universities in Korea. For the ROKA, this means that they are losing intelligent soldiers to the US Army. To minimize this, the selection process now randomly picks soldiers from the pool of applicants, instead of hiring the most qualified soldiers. The selection process requires applicants to submit their English proficiency test scores as a mandatory document, and driver's license and computer software proficiency test scores such as Microsoft certificates to quality applicants who are eligible to be drivers or administrators. These measures were introduced to diversify the pool of applicants throughout Korean Army soldiers, but lot of intelligent soldiers still enlist as a KATUSA for superior facilities and treatments. Holistic and random approach is used to quality candidates into different units, and these variety of exam results seem to affect significantly into which positions each applicant is located. Some of the recent criticisms from the South Korean side include alleged forced-recruitment during the 1950-53 Korean War, when the 7th Infantry Division commandeered reinforcements for the landing at Incheon. These so- called \\"First KATUSA soldiers\\" included 313 men from Busan. (The South Korean side claims they were taken from refugee camps, but whether they volunteered or were coerced remains a matter of dispute.)

A tactical nuclear weapon (TNW) or non-strategic nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon which is designed to be used on a battlefield in military situations mostly with friendly forces in proximity and perhaps even on contested friendly territory. Generally smaller in explosive power, they are defined in contrast to strategic nuclear weapons: which are designed to be mostly targeted in the enemy interior away from the war front against military bases, cities, towns, arms industries, and other hardened or larger-area targets to damage the enemy's ability to wage war. Tactical nuclear weapons include gravity bombs, short-range missiles, artillery shells, land mines, depth charges, and torpedoes which are equipped with nuclear warheads. Also in this category are nuclear armed ground-based or shipborne surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and air-to-air missiles. Small, two- man portable, or truck-portable, tactical weapons (sometimes misleadingly referred to as suitcase nukes), such as the Special Atomic Demolition Munition and the Davy Crockett recoilless rifle (recoilless smoothbore gun), have been developed, but the difficulty of combining sufficient yield with portability could limit their military utility. In wartime, such explosives could be used for demolishing \\"chokepoints\\" to enemy offensives, such as at tunnels, narrow mountain passes, and long viaducts. There is no exact definition of the \\"tactical\\" category on range or yield of the nuclear weapon.Some weapons could be tactical or strategic at the same time, depending only on the potential enemy. For example, an Indian nuclear missile with a 500 km range is tactical when it is evaluated by Russia but understandably would be considered strategic if evaluated by Pakistan. The yield of tactical nuclear weapons is generally lower than that of strategic nuclear weapons, but larger ones are still very powerful, and some variable-yield warheads serve in both roles. For example, the W89 200 kiloton warhead was intended to arm both the tactical Sea Lance anti-submarine rocket propelled depth charge and the strategic bomber launched SRAM II stand off missile. Modern tactical nuclear warheads have yields up to the tens of kilotons, or potentially hundreds, several times that of the weapons used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Specifically on the Korean Peninsula, with a nuclear North Korea facing off against a NPT-compliant South Korea, there have been calls to request a return of US-owned and -operated short range low yield nuclear weapons, called tactical by the US military, to provide a local strategic deterrent to the North's growing domestically produced nuclear arsenal and delivery systems.http://thediplomat.com/2013/03/not-a-good-idea-american-nukes-in- south-korea/ Some tactical nuclear weapons have specific features meant to enhance their battlefield characteristics, such as variable yield, which allow their explosive power to be varied over a wide range for different situations, or enhanced radiation weapons (the so-called \\"neutron bombs\\"), which are meant to maximize ionizing radiation exposure and to minimize blast effects. Strategic missiles and bombers are assigned preplanned targets including enemy airfields, radars, and surface to air defenses, not only counterforce strikes on hardened or wide area bomber, submarine, and missile bases. The strategic mission is to eliminate the enemy nation's national defenses to enable following bombers and missiles to threaten the enemy nation's strategic forces, command, and economy more realistically, rather than targeting mobile military assets in nearly real time by using tactical weapons that are optimized for time sensitive strike missions that are often close to friendly forces. Tactical nuclear weapons were a large part of the peak nuclear weapons stockpile levels during the Cold War.US scientists with a full-scale cut-away model of the W48, a very small tactical nuclear weapon with an explosive yield equivalent to 72 tons of TNT (0.072 kiloton). Around 100 of such shells were produced during the Cold War. The risk that use of tactical nuclear weapons could unexpectedly lead to a rapid escalation of a war to full use of strategic weapons has led to proposals being made within NATO and other organizations to place limitations on - and make more transparent - the stockpiling and use of tactical weapons. No tactical nuclear weapon has ever been used in a combat situation.

Capable of firing a 100 kiloton nuclear warhead a distance of 185 km American MGR-3 Little John missile, measuring 4.4. meters long with a diameter of 32 cm and a weight of 350 kg. Capable of firing a W45 warhead (10 kiloton yield) a distance of 19 km Pluton missile circa 1970s. Capable of firing a 15 kiloton nuclear warhead a distance of 120 km By using tactical nuclear weapons there is a risk of escalating the conflict until it reaches a tipping point which provokes the use of strategic nuclear weapons such as ICBMs. Additionally, the tactical nuclear weapons most likely to be used first (i.e., the smallest, low-yield weapons such as nuclear artillery dating from the 1960s) have usually been under less stringent political control at times of military combat crises than strategic weapons.http://www.atomictraveler.com/RockIsland.pdf Early Permissive Action Links could be as simple as a mechanical combination lock. If a relatively junior officer in control of a small tactical nuclear weapon (e.g., the M29 Davy Crockett) were in imminent danger of being overwhelmed by enemy forces, he could request permission to fire it and due to decentralised control of warhead authorization, his request might quickly be granted during a crisis. For these reasons, stockpiles of tactical nuclear warheads in most countries' arsenals have been dramatically reduced c. 2010, and the smallest types have been completely eliminated. Additionally, the increased sophistication of \\"Category F\\" PAL mechanisms and their associated communications infrastructure mean that centralised control of tactical nuclear warheads (by the country's most senior political leaders) can now be retained, even during combat. Some variable yield nuclear warheads such as the B61 nuclear bomb have been produced in both tactical and strategic versions. Whereas the lowest selectable yield of a tactical B61 (Mod 3 and Mod 4) is 0.3 kilotons (300 tons), modern PAL mechanisms ensure that centralised political control is maintained over each weapon, including their destructive yields. With the introduction of the B61 Mod 12, the United States will have four hundred identical nuclear bombs whose strategic or tactical nature will be set purely by the mission and target as well as type of aircraft on which they are carried.Kristensen, Hans. \\"B61 LEP: Increasing NATO Nuclear Capability and Precision Low-Yield Strikes.\\" FAS, 15 June 2011. According to several reports, including by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, as a result of the effectiveness and acceptability of USAF use of precision munitions with little collateral damage in the Kosovo conflict in what amounted to strategic destruction once only possible with nuclear weapons or massive bombing, Vladimir Putin, then-secretary of Security Council of Russia, formulated a concept (‚Äúescalate to de-escalate‚Äù) of using both tactical and strategic nuclear threats and strikes to de-escalate or cause an enemy to disengage from a conventional conflict threatening what Russia considers a strategic interest.Russia's Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons, by Dr. Jacob W.

In November 2011, the Baptist General Association of Virginia voted to restore the association's relationship with Averett University.  Admissions  In 2011, 54% of applicants were admitted. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.  Academics  Averett offers associate and bachelor's degree programs in approximately 30 majors. There are also two master's degree programs available: Master of Education degree and a Master of Business Administration degree. The student-to-faculty ratio is 14:1.  Campus  Averett's main campus is a campus on West Main Street in Danville. The North Campus Athletic Center and Averett Flight Center at Danville Regional Airport are also in Danville. The Equestrian Center in Pelham, NC lies just across the Virginia- North Carolina border. Averett's adult education program, Graduate and Professional Studies (GPS), has campus centers in Danville, Richmond and Tidewater. GPS classes are offered at 12 locations around Virginia.

They operate within the market system, independently of the state, as a form of mutual aid, oriented toward service rather than pecuniary profit. Consumers' cooperatives often take the form of retail outlets owned and operated by their consumers, such as food co-ops. However, there are many types of consumers' cooperatives, operating in areas such as health care, insurance, housing, utilities and personal finance (including credit unions). In some countries, consumers' cooperatives are known as cooperative retail societies or retail co-ops, though they should not be confused with retailers' cooperatives, whose members are retailers rather than consumers. Consumers' cooperatives may, in turn, form cooperative federations. These may come in the form of cooperative wholesale societies, through which consumers' cooperatives collectively purchase goods at wholesale prices and, in some cases, own factories. Alternatively, they may be members of cooperative unions. Consumer cooperation has been a focus of study in the field of cooperative economics. History Model of Robert Owen's visionary project for a cooperative settlement. Owenites fired bricks to build it, but construction never took place. Consumer cooperatives rose to prominence during the industrial revolution as part of the labour movement. As employment moved to industrial areas and job sectors declined, workers began organizing and controlling businesses for themselves. Workers cooperative were originally sparked by \\"critical reaction to industrial capitalism and the excesses of the industrial revolution.\\" The formation of some workers cooperatives were designed to \\"cope with the evils of unbridled capitalism and the insecurities of wage labor\\".Adams, Frank and Gary Hansen (1993) Putting Democracy To Work: A Practical Guide for Starting and Managing Worker-Owned Businesses, Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc, San Francisco The first documented consumer cooperative was founded in 1769, in a barely furnished cottage in Fenwick, East Ayrshire, when local weavers manhandled a sack of oatmeal into John Walker's whitewashed front room and began selling the contents at a discount, forming the Fenwick Weavers' Society. In the decades that followed, several cooperatives or cooperative societies formed including Lennoxtown Friendly Victualling Society, founded in 1812.Lennoxtown (Local History) The philosophy that underpinned the cooperative movement stemmed from the socialist writings of thinkers including Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. Robert Owen, considered by many as the father of the cooperative movement, made his fortune in the cotton trade, but believed in putting his workers in a good environment with access to education for themselves and their children. These ideas were put into effect successfully in the cotton mills of New Lanark, Scotland. It was here that the first co-operative store was opened. Spurred on by the success of this, he had the idea of forming \\"villages of co-operation\\" where workers would drag themselves out of poverty by growing their own food, making their own clothes and ultimately becoming self-governing. He tried to form such communities in Orbiston in Scotland and in New Harmony, Indiana in the United States of America, but both communities failed. Similar early experiments were made in the early 19th century and by 1830 there were several hundred co-operatives. Dr William King made Owen's ideas more workable and practical. He believed in starting small, and realized that the working classes would need to set up co- operatives for themselves, so he saw his role as one of instruction. He founded a monthly periodical called The Co-operator,The Co-operator URL: https://books.google.com/books?id=4mATAAAAQAAJ the first edition of which appeared on 1 May 1828. This gave a mixture of co-operative philosophy and practical advice about running a shop using cooperative principles. Modern movement The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was established in 1844 and defined the modern cooperative movement. The first successful organization was the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, established in England in 1844. The Rochdale Pioneers established the ‚ÄòRochdale Principles‚Äô on which they ran their cooperative. This became the basis for the development and growth of the modern cooperative movement. As the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution was forcing more and more skilled workers into poverty, these tradesmen decided to band together to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford. With lessons from prior failed attempts at co-operation in mind, they designed the now famous Rochdale Principles, and over a period of four months they struggled to pool one pound sterling per person for a total of 28 pounds of capital. On December 21, 1844, they opened their store with a very meagre selection of butter, sugar, flour, oatmeal and a few candles. Within three months, they expanded their selection to include tea and tobacco, and they were soon known for providing high quality, unadulterated goods. The Co-operative Group formed gradually over 140 years from the merger of many independent retail societies, and their wholesale societies and federations. In 1863, twenty years after the Rochdale Pioneers opened their co-operative, the North of England Co-operative Society was launched by 300 individual co-ops across Yorkshire and Lancashire. By 1872, it had become known as the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). Through the 20th century, smaller societies merged with CWS, such as the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (1973) and the South Suburban Co-operative Society (1984). Governance and operation Consumer cooperatives utilize the cooperative principle of democratic member control, or one member/one vote. Most consumer cooperatives have a board of directors elected by and from the membership. The board is usually responsible for hiring management and ensuring that the cooperative meets its goals, both financial and otherwise. Democratic functions, such as petitioning or recall of board members, may be codified in the bylaws or organizing document of the cooperative. Most consumer cooperatives hold regular membership meetings (often once a year). As mutually owned businesses, each member of a society has a shareholding equal to the sum they paid in when they joined. Large consumers' co-ops are run much like any other business and require workers, managers, clerks, products, and customers to keep the doors open and the business running. In smaller businesses the consumer/owners are often workers as well. Consumers' cooperatives can differ greatly in start up and also in how the co-op is run but to be true to the consumers' cooperative form of business the enterprise should follow the Rochdale Principles. Finance and approach to capital accumulation The customers or consumers of the goods and/or services the cooperative provides are often also the individuals who have provided the capital required to launch or purchase that enterprise. The major difference between consumers' cooperatives and other forms of business is that the purpose of a consumers' cooperative association is to provide quality goods and services at the lowest cost to the consumer/owners rather than to sell goods and services at the highest price above cost that the consumer is willing to pay. In practice consumers' cooperatives price goods and services at competitive market rates. Where a for-profit enterprise will treat the difference between cost (including labor etc.) and selling price as financial gain for investors, the consumer owned enterprise may retain this to accumulate capital in common ownership, distribute it to meet the consumer's social objectives, or refund this sum to the consumer/owner as an over-payment. (Accumulated capital may be held as reserves, or invested in growth as working capital or the purchase of capital assets such as plant and buildings.) While some claim that surplus payment returns to consumer/owner patrons should be taxed the same as dividends paid to corporate stock holders, others argue that consumer cooperatives do not return a profit by traditional definition, and similar tax standards do not apply. Problems Since consumer cooperatives are run democratically, they are subject to the same problems typical of democratic government. Such difficulties can be mitigated by frequently providing member/owners with reliable educational materials regarding current business conditions. In addition, because a consumer cooperative is owned by the users of a good or service as opposed to the producers of that good or service, the same sorts of labor issues may arise between the workers and the cooperative as would appear in any other company. This is one critique of consumer cooperatives in favor of worker cooperatives. Pursuit of social goals January 1947 Co-op Magazine back cover designed as a promotional posterMany advocates of the formation of consumer cooperatives ‚Äì from a variety of political perspectives ‚Äì have seen them as integral to the achievement of wider social goals. Thus, the founding document of the Rochdale Pioneers, who established one of the earliest consumer cooperatives in England in 1844, expressed a vision that went far beyond the simple shop with which they began: :\\"That as soon as practicable, this society shall proceed to arrange the powers of production, distribution, education, and government, or in other words to establish a selfsupporting home-colony of united interests, or assist other societies in establishing such colonies.\\" Cooperative Federalists, a term coined in the writings of Beatrice Webb, were advocates for the formation of federations of consumer cooperatives as means of achieving social reform. They anticipated such a development as bringing a broad set of benefits including economic democracy and justice, transparency, greater product purity, and financial benefits for consumers. Examples=Europe One of the world's largest consumer co-operative federations operates in the UK as The Co-op, which together operates over 5500 branches of 'Co-op' branded business including Co-op Food (The UK's sixth largest supermarket chain), Co- op Funeralcare, Co-op Travel, Co-op Legal Services and Co-op Electrical. The Co-operative Group is by far the largest of these businesses, itself having over 4500 outlets and operating the collective buying group. In Ireland, the Dublin Food Coop has been in operation since 1983. In Scandinavia, the national cooperations of Norway, Sweden and Denmark joined as Coop Norden in January 2002, but separated again in 2008. In Italy, the Coop Italia chain formed by many sub-cooperatives controlled 17.7% of the grocery market in 2005. In Finland, the S Group is owned by 22 regional cooperatives and 19 local cooperative stores, which in turn are owned by their customers. In 2005 the S Group overtook its nearest rival Kesko Oyj with a 36% share of retail grocery sales compared to Kesko's 28%. In France, Coop Atlantique owns 7 hypermarkets, 39 supermarkets and about 200 convenience stores. In Germany, The ReWe Group is a diversified holding company of consumer cooperatives that include thousands of retail stores, discount stores, and tourism agencies. It ranks as the second largest supermarket chain in Germany and in the top ten cooperative groups in the world. Australia The Co-op Bookshop sold textbooks both online and on university campuses. It also owned Australian Geographic. In 2020 its retail stores were closed and its online store was sold to Booktopia. The Wine Society (Australian Wine Consumers‚Äô Co-operative Society Limited), established in 1946, now has over 58,000 members. It also sources and sells premium wines under the Society label, runs comprehensive wine education courses and recognises excellence from young winemakers. Bank Australia was formed in 2011 as the Members and Education Credit Union, changing its name to Bank Australia in 2015. The bank is wholly owned by its customers, reported at 125,000 in 2012. Japan Japan has a very large and well-developed consumer cooperative movement with over 14 million members; retail co-ops alone had a combined turnover of 2.5 trillion Yen (21 billion U.S. Dollars) in April, 2003.Japanese Consumers' Co-operative Union., 2003 Co- op Kobe („Ç≥„Éº„Éó„Åì„ÅÜ„Åπ) in the Hy≈çgo Prefecture is the largest retail cooperative in Japan and, with over 1.2 million members, is one of the largest cooperatives in the world. In addition to retail co-ops there are medical, housing and insurance co-ops alongside institutional (workplace based) co-ops, co-ops for school teachers and university based co-ops. Approximately 1 in 5 of all Japanese households belongs to a local retail co-op and 90% of all co-op members are women. (Takamura, 1995). Nearly 6 million households belong to one of the 1,788,000 Han groups (Japanese Consumers' Co-operative Union., 2003). These consist of a group of five to ten members in a neighbourhood who place a combined weekly order which is then delivered by truck the following week. A particular strength of Japanese consumer co-ops in recent years has been the growth of community supported agriculture where fresh produce is sent direct to consumers from producers without going through the market. Some of co-op organisations, for example, in Tokyo metropolis and Kanagawa prefecture, manage their local political parties from 1970's; generally names itself as the \\"Network Movement\\" (\\"Tokyo Seikatsusha (it means \\"Living Persons\\") Network\\",Tokyo Seikatusha Network Official Site \\"Kanagawa Network Movement\\",Kanagawa Network Movement Official Site and so on.). They depend on consumers movement, feminism, regionalism, and prefer to anti-nuclear. These parties keep small but steady sections in prefecture and municipal assemblies.

CBC News, Terri Coles Feb 17, 2018 History Boyd's Cove was first settled by the Beothuks in the late 18th century. During the summer months, the people lived by the cove in wigwams built over shallow excavations in the ground. As well as more traditional activities, the group scavenged metal items left behind at French and English summer fishing camps, and refashioned these for their own use. Although these indigenous people didn't interact with European traders as much as most native peoples, some of the Beothuk were killed by encroaching settlers,\\"Newfoundland: Last days of Beothuk\\". Mitchel Smith, Toronto Sun, June 25, 2014 and researchers have concluded that the group later died out partly because of exposure to disease and partly because of starvation, which in turn was caused both by the resulting poor health and by limited access to resources after European settlement.\\"Boyd's Cove: Beothuks\\". Heritage Newfoundland. A settlement at Boyd's Cove was later established by the Freake, Newman and Robinson families from Fogo Island in the late 19th century. Settlers also came from the Change Islands to settle at the cove, on the mainland. At first Boyd's Cove was a logging and fishing community; later it became a producer of turnip, carrot, potato and hay in the Nortre Dame Bay area. Because of its sheltered location on the shoreline, the village often hosted residents from the more exposed fishing villages in the winter. The rugged landscape and climate meant that survival there was often a struggle; with the nearest hospital in Lewisporte, NL, nearly 1¬Ω hours away by horse in the 1920s and 1930s, medical care was often unavailable. If there was a serious illness, such as tuberculosis, residents would have to go to St. John's. Archaeology A major Beothuk archaeological site at Boyd's Cove was excavated by Dr. Ralph T. Pastore of Memorial University of Newfoundland. in the early 1980s. The site is now home to the Boyd's Cove Interpretation Centre. Archaeological evidence revealed that Boyd's Cove has been occupied intermittently for about 2000 years. Beothuk pit houses dating from the late 17th or the early 18th century have yielded stone tools lying nearby European artifacts. These tools helped to establish a link between the Beothuk and their prehistoric ancestors. Faunal analysis indicated that the site was occupied at least from late winter to fall, and that the Beothuk relied on both marine and land resources for their subsistence. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995.

About half the neighborhood is industrial or formerly industrial, dominated by warehouses. The Ivy City Yard, a railroad coach yard and maintenance facility for the passenger railroad Amtrak, is situated northwest across New York Avenue NE. Ivy City was laid out as a suburban development for African Americans in 1873. Development was slow. From 1879 to 1901, the neighborhood hosted the Ivy City Racetrack, a major horse racing facility in the District of Columbia. Construction on the rail yard began in 1907 and was complete within a year, although much of the facilities there were demolished in 1953 and 1954 as railroads switched from coal-fired locomotives to diesel- fueled or electric engines. The Alexander Crummell School, a major focal point of the community, opened in 1911. After some years of enrollment decline, it closed in 1972 but has not been demolished. The area has undergone some gentrification in the 21st century, although people living in the residential core of Ivy City remain very poor and unemployment is high. Geography Ivy City is on a triangular strip of land in the central part of the Northeast quadrant, bounded by New York Avenue to the northwest, West Virginia Avenue to the east, and Mt. Olivet Road to the south. The neighborhood is unusual in that it is also surrounded on all sides by significant landmarks: Gallaudet University (across Mt. Olivet Rd.), Mount Olivet Cemetery (across West Virginia Ave.), and Amtrak's Ivy City yard (across New York Avenue). Ivy City is located in Ward 5. When founded, the neighborhood was outside the boundaries of the L'Enfant Plan for the city of Washington within the District of Columbia. Founding Ivy City In 1831, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) received approval for a plan to build its Washington Branch, and passenger train service between Baltimore and Washington began in 1835. The track was built from the District border with Maryland to Boundary Avenue (now Florida Avenue) along the route of the then-unbuilt West Virginia Avenue. Much of the land surrounding the future Ivy City was owned by the Fenwick family. These were descendants of Thomas Notley, the 8th Proprietary governor of the Province of Maryland from 1676 through 1679. Mary Fenwick's father was Notley Young, one of the largest landowners in southern Maryland and who, along with David Burns, Daniel Carroll, Samuel Davidson, and Robert Peter were later known as the \\"original patentees\\" (original landowners) of the District of Columbia. The land that became the District of Columbia was originally given to George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, by King Charles I in 1632 (ignoring claims to the land held by Native Americans). Beginning in 1664, Calvert's heir, Leonard Calvert, began subdividing this claim and issuing title to various sized parcels to buyers. On September 24, 1685, Andrew Clarke purchased from Calvert of land fronting on the Anacostia River. The southern boundary of this \\"patent\\" (as title to land was called) began about where East Capitol Street meets the river, and ran north-northwest to about Trinidad Avenue NE. Clarke called this patent Meurs. In 1734, Thomas Evans purchased of Meurs from Clarke, and renamed the patent Chance. Notley Young purchased of Chance in 1771, and then purchased of a 1717 patent known as The Gleaning in 1786. Young combined Chance, The Gleaning, and several other smaller purchases (parts of Allison's Forest Enlarged, Allison's Forest Enlarged Resurveyed, and The Inclosure) into a single new tract‚Äîwhich he called Youngsborough‚Äîin 1793. Over time, others purchased small portions of Youngsborough from the Notleys and Fenwicks. On February 21, 1871, the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 expanded the City of Washington so it encompassed the entire District of Columbia. This brought the Youngsborough tract under the jurisdiction of the city. On April 3, 1871, landowners George Oyster and Edward Fenwick sold their property to Frederick W. Jones, a director of the Georgetown Savings Bank and a local real estate developer. Jones had the land platted, and the Ivy City Subdivision was recognized by the city on May 12, 1873. History of Ivy City Map showing the growing Ivy City in 1887. Ivy City in 1887, showing Patterson Avenue and Gallaudet Street. Jones laid out 205 lots in Ivy City. He envisioned the subdivision as a bucolic, rural community catering exclusively to African Americans. Many streets in the area were named for adjacent landlords (Corcoran, Kendall, Fenwick, Gallaudet). Lots were priced at $100 each ($ in dollars), and the earliest publicly acknowledged land sale occurred in December 1873 when F.P. Blair purchased Lot 9 for $150. A major auction of lots occurred in May 1875, but while many lots sold there was little building. Nearly all the residents were African-American, and structures consisted primarily of wooden shacks with no heat, electricity, natural gas, or sewer. The city provided drinking water from public pipes. Lots, however, were quite large compared to many of those in the Federal City. The Ivy City horse- racing track In 1878, the National Fair Grounds Association was incorporated with the purpose of hosting a \\"national fair\\" and building a horse racing track in the District of Columbia. The following year, on August 30, 1879, Charles Stewart and Mrs. Louis Fethervitch sold their parcels of land (both of which were adjacent to Ivy City) to the National Fair Grounds Association (NFGA). On September 2, President Rutherford B. Hayes broke ground for a horse racing track on the site. About September 14, NFGA purchased Lots 1, 2, and 3 in Square 1 and Lots 1 through 10 in Square 9 in Ivy City from the Freedman's Savings and Trust Company. This allowed the race track to extend southwest into Ivy City proper. On September 15, NFGA cut Gallaudet Street and Patterson Avenue (the latter no longer exists) to provide access to the track. The firm also sought permission from Gallaudet University to cut Mount Olivet Road NE from the railroad tracks up to Brentwood Road. The B&O; Railroad built a siding onto the property to facilitate trains delivering patrons to the racetrack. This included a passenger platform long, and a small telegraph office. The National Fair Grounds opened on October 28, 1879. President Hayes declared a holiday in the city so workers could attend, and Hayes spoke at the opening to a crowd estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000 strong. Buildings on the ground housed hundreds of exhibits featuring local products, services, and foods, and artworks and sporting events were held every day. The fair itself closed on November 8. Beginning in the spring of 1880, the NFGA continued to operate the horse racing track near Ivy City. The B&O; Railroad removed its passenger platform in 1886, hindering public access to the site for a time, but rebuilt of it in 1887. Heavy debts and competition from racetracks in Maryland forced the company into bankruptcy. It sold the property at public auction to James Lansburgh, one of its directors, in July 1890 for $133,500 ($ in dollars). On January 7, 1891, Lansburgh sold of the parcel to Howard P. Marshall for $180,000 ($ in dollars), who sold it for the same sum on September 10 to the Ivy City Brick Company.; On March 2, 1891, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting lotteries and bookmaking within of the original limits of the Federal City. Ivy City Brick did not immediately tear down the track and grandstand. In February 1893, a syndicate of New York City investors, led by Representative Timothy J. Campbell, (D-New York), attempted to revive racing at Ivy City.; The clubhouse was destroyed by fire on February 23, and the B&O; refused to run special trains to accommodate racegoers (significantly hindering attendance). After just three weeks, the racing effort collapsed on March 17. Racing at Ivy City resumed on May 14, 1893, under the auspices of the Chevy Chase Hunt Club.; New Jersey racetrack owners George Engeman and Albert Gleason leased the Ivy City track in August 1893 with the aim of having a 25-day \\"winter season\\" of racing in November. Engeman was initially opposed by the Washington Jockey Club, which was in the process of opening a racetrack in the Benning neighborhood east of the Anacostia River. Racing began on November 22 at both tracks, Both city and federal officials declared the resumption of horse racing at Ivy City in violation of the 1891 law. At issue was whether the Ivy City track was within the one-mile limit. The city argued that distance to the track should be measured in a straight line, while track officials said it should be measured by the shortest route possible (which put it just outside the prohibited area).; The Ivy City track obtained a one-month racing license while the issue was decided, but betting was prohibited during this period. Eager to provide betting, track officials set up a tent outside the one-mile limit, and accepted bets there.; This was not a success, and bookmaking resumed at Ivy City. Federal officials threatened a police raid, and Engeman halted racing until a court could rule on the issue. U.S. District Attorney Arthur A. Birney refused to allow a \\"test case\\", and demanded that racing end. Racing and betting resumed on December 26. But police arrested bookmakers after the first race, and no further betting occurred.; The December 26 races were the last for the season. Although jockeys continued to race for their own enjoyment over the next several weeks,; ; ; a grand jury indicted Engeman and several bookmakers on December 29, 1893.; Trial began before Judge Cole of the D.C. Criminal Court on January 4, and on January 16 the court convicted all the defendants.; ; The sentences were appealed, but the appellate court declined to overturn them in 1895. The Ivy City stables and track continued to be used for stabling, training, and training races for horses running at the Benning racecourse for the next several years.; ; ; ; In 1899, Lansburgh sold the rest of his land to developers. The Ivy City track continued to be used for stables and racing at least into the spring 1901 season.; Their last known use was for the winter 1901 racing season, when they were ready for use but not needed due to the few number of horses running at Benning. Rail yard By 1903, only a single small brick building and the path of the racetrack still existed. It is not known when the grandstands or track were actually demolished. However, by 1903 the city was already planning to extend S, U, V, and 15th Streets NE and New York Avenue NE through the former racetrack site. Federal legislation granting the B&O; access to its right of way was not due to expire until 1910. But with development rapidly expanding in the area and the need for streets pressing, Congress enacted legislation on December 3, 1900, requiring the railroad to give up the right of way by 1905. The act allowed the B&O; to purchase land in the Eckington neighborhood for a large rail yard, and for construction of a new passenger terminal in downtown Washington. The 1900 act drew strenuous objection from citizens of Eckington.; ; The railroad subsequently won passage of an amendment on February 12, 1901, extending the time for relocation of its track to February 1906, and allowing it to move its rail yard to Ivy City. On February 28, 1903, Congress passed legislation authorizing various railroads in the city to unite to build a new \\"union\\" passenger terminal to replace the four existing terminals scattered about downtown. This legislation led to the construction of Union Station, completed in 1908. This gave added importance to the new Ivy City rail yard, because the tracks to the new station would begin at Ivy City. By this time, the former racetrack site at Ivy City had significantly declined. The track had subsided, and rains filled the old track‚Äîturning it into a deep pond. In June 1903, a local African American boy drowned in the pond. Initially, city officials declined to order landowner Daniel McCarthy to fill in the pond, as McCarthy argued that construction on the rail yard would fill in the pond. But when another boy drowned there in July 1906, McCarthy was ordered to immediately fill in the depression. There were also numerous housing lots in Ivy City on which no construction had occurred. As excavation began on Union Station, these unoccupied lots were taken over by the B&O; and used for a tent city to house workers. More than 110 men lived at the tent city, where living conditions were very poor. Most of the workers were Italian, and one worker died from pneumonia in October 1903. This led to an extensive investigation into living conditions in the tent city. Although sanitation, sewage, and trash were severe problems, the men generally were found to be well-fed and the tents warm enough to withstand winter conditions.; ; With the arrival of the rail yard, some living conditions in Ivy City improved as infrastructure was upgraded to accommodate the railroad. In December 1905, the city approved construction of the first sewer main to serve the neighborhood. Construction on the rail yard began in 1907. The B&O; began dismantling its rail yard at New Jersey Avenue NW and D Street NW, and began moving the equipment to Ivy City. The new rail yard, located about outside the Federal City limits, included two long roundhouses, each surrounded by 25 short tracks leading to train sheds where engines could be stores or worked on. Each shed had a pit below the track, allowing the engine to be worked on from below. The rail yard also contained a \\"coal wharf\\", a coal storage facility which could load an engine's tender in under 30 seconds, and two gigantic water spouts which could fill an engine's water tank from above in less than a minute. The tracks throughout the rail yard were lined with numerous inspection pits (where workers in a pit low the tracks could inspect the lower and underside portions of an engine quickly) and ash pits (pits where engines could quickly dump their coal ash for later retrieval and disposal). The Ivy City rail yard also contained a coal-powered steam generating plant. This plant provided steam heat for railroad buildings at Ivy City as well as the B&O;'s Eckington rail yard more than away. Steam was also used to prime locomotive engines and preheat passenger cars before use. The plant generated a large amount of smoke and ash, which polluted the Ivy City neighborhood. Unbuilt land in Ivy City became the site of another tent city in the summer of 1908. This time, machinists overhauling locomotives for the B&O; went on strike for higher wages (they demanded 32 cents an hour) on July 10. The railroad immediately locked them out and hired strikebreakers and permanent replacements. The striking workers set up a large meeting tent at Ivy City, and surrounded it with smaller sleeping tents for the men. Dubbing their tent city \\"Camp Wine View\\", the men armed themselves with clubs and began picketing the new B&O; rail yard at Ivy City. There was no violence, and the strike largely ended by July 17 as workers went back to work without a contract.; ; ; ; ; A portion of the Ivy City rail yard was electrified in 1934, reducing the amount of smoke coming from coal-fired locomotive engines. Even so, by the mid 1940s, the Ivy City rail yard was handling 200 coal-fed locomotives a day. In 1947, Ivy City residents made a concerted effort to complain to the city about the amount of soot, smoke, and noise coming from the rail yard. After an investigation, the city fined the B&O; in February 1948 for violating anti- smoke laws. Alexander Crummell School Alexander Crummell. The Alexander Crummell School in 2008. Ivy City residents began asking that the city build an elementary school in their neighborhood in 1893. As most of the residents were African American, and racial segregation in public education was required by law at the time, the school would have served African American children only. The need for a school was urgent, as the nearest school for black children was located in the Benning neighborhood, nearly distant. Just over a year later, the District of Columbia Public Schools board of trustees approved plans to spend $4,500 ($ in dollars) to purchase land at 1900 Gallaudet Street NE and build a two-room schoolhouse. At that time, Congress had complete control over the city's budget, and it cut the estimated cost of the school to $4,000 ($ in dollars) in June 1895. The land for the school was purchased from George McKinlay in August 1895, and the George W. Barkman & Son construction company began construction on the building (whose cost was budgeted at $2,390 ($ in dollars)) in September.; The Ivy City School was completed in early February 1896. As Ivy City continued to grow, there were repeated calls to enlarge the school and make improvements to it. A two-room addition was proposed by local residents in 1902, and constructed in 1903. ; The Ivy City School was the launching point for the career of African American educator Alfred Kiger Savoy, who was first appointed a teacher at the school in 1903. Kiger eventually became assistant superintendent of the D.C. public school system, and oversaw all African American elementary schools in the city. he retired in 1953. At his death in 1964 at the age of 80, he was lauded as one of the most capable and effective leaders the D.C. Public Schools had ever had. The 1903 addition did little to alleviate overcrowding, however, and in 1906 the city leased a room in a home away as a classroom. DCPS proposed purchasing an addition of land and erecting a new four-room elementary school at a cost of $35,000 ($ in dollars) in 1908, but Congress refused to approve the expenditure. A year later, DCPS again proposed construction of a four-room elementary school, although by this time the school's size had expanded to six rooms and the amount of the required land to .; This time, Congress approved the new school. The DCPS board of trustees agreed in November 1910 to name the school the Alexander Crummell School,; after the prominent Episcopal priest who was a prominent advocate of Pan-Africanism and who founded St. Luke's Episcopal Church‚Äîthe first independent black Episcopal church in the city. It was the first school in the city to be named for an African American. Plans for the new school were ready by February 1, 1911, and ground was broken on March 20. The school was designed by Snowden Ashford, the Municipal Architect for the city, and the total cost of land and construction was $44,000. The two-story structure was in the Renaissance Revival style, and was constructed of stone with stucco-covered walls. Large windows admitted extensive amounts of natural light, and extensive tiling decorated the interior. The school opened on October 22, 1911, even though it was not finished. Expansion of the Alexander Crummell School was proposed several times over the next six decades, to no avail. A six-room, $100,000 addition was approved the DCPS in 1924, but cut by Congress every time it was proposed from 1924 to 1927. By 1930, the school was no longer in good condition. The building was constructed on a low spot on the site, which meant that water (sometimes deep) ponded on the property when it rained. The old coal heating system failed to keep the school warm in winter, and covered the walls in soot. The playground was far too small to accommodate the school's growing enrollment, and there was no gymnasium or assembly hall. A $36,000 two-room addition was proposed in 1931, a $25,000 two-room addition in 1932, and a $10,800 doubling of the school's size in 1933. No action was taken on these proposals. The Great Depression and World War II limited funding for school construction. Ivy City continued to grow in the 1930s and 1940s, and in 1949 local residents asked the city to build an eight-room addition and pool for the school as well as expand the playground. A similar request was made in 1950, with residents also demanding an assembly hall and gymnasium. An addition was proposed in 1954 and a 12-room addition, auditorium, and modernization of the heating and lighting requested in 1957. These requests were also turned down. By 1971, the Alexander Crummell School had 397 students, but enrollment was declining rapidly as residents fled the decaying neighborhood. The school closed in 1972. The Washington Urban League leased the school in 1973 for use as a day care center, private school, and recreation center, but extensive vandalism and several burglaries caused the organization to close these programs down. By October 1976, the Alexander Crummell School was completely vacant, and DCPS voted to close the building and seek no tenants for it in January 1977.; Over the next few years, the school parking lot and land were used for a number of uses, including a parking lot for city vehicles. From 1997 to 2003, trailers for a homeless men's shelter sat on the site.; In 1999, the Accucrete construction company offered to buy the property, but the city could not work out a deal and the offer was withdrawn in 2001. The Crummell School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The Washington Animal Rescue League offered to lease the school for use as an animal shelter in early 2004, but this proposal was not accepted. Community residents long pressed the city to turn the school into a community center, but city officials said the structure needed at least $7 million in renovations (but was only worth $1.65 million). Ivy City elementary students were assigned to Ruth K. Webb Elementary School at 1375 Mt. Olivet Road NE, which was erected in 1958. Streets Access to lots at Ivy City was initially limited to dirt tracks. The cutting of streets was limited until developers felt enough lots had been sold to warrant better access. For example, as late as 1895, the area's roads were ungraded ruts lacking sidewalks and street lights, there was no storm water drainage, and fresh drinking water was provided by wells (not the city water system). Although lots at Ivy City began to be sold in 1873, it was not until September 1879 that the first street, Gallaudet Street, was cut. Central Avenue followed about 1888, Corcoran Street about 1890, a portion of Kendall Street about 1891, Okie Street about 1892, Olivet Street (later Mt. Olivet Road) about 1892, Providence Street about 1895, and Fenwick Street about 1898. At some point, S Street NE was cut through the area from the west, and 15th Street NE cut in a U shape on the southeast side of West Virginia Avenue NE beginning at Fenwick Street. In January 1907, after the B&O; Railroad removed its tracks from the right of way, the District government announced plans to cut and pave West Virginia Avenue NE from Florida Avenue to 16th Street NE (near the northeastern tip of Ivy City). Grading of part of the street occurred by 1911, but it is unclear just when the street was graded or paved. Other street changes occurred as well. After a study,; the city eliminated S Street SE in Ivy City and closed but did not eliminate 15th Street SE. The city allowed a new street (probably the eastern half of Okie Street NW) to be cut parallel to New York Avenue NE to straighten the street lines within the development. Another change added the northernmost block of Kendall Street NE, which was cut and paved in 1933, allowing the street to connect with New York Avenue NE. In April 1941, city engineers proposed a master plan for improving roads and interchanges in the city. The master plan proposed widening West Virginia Avenue NE (two lanes to three) between Mt. Olivet Road and Montana Avenue NE; widening Mt. Olivet Rd. (two lanes to four) from Bladensburg Road to New York Avenue NE; realigning Brentwood Road into an S-curve so it meets Mt. Olivet Road at New York Avenue NE, with a major new intersection and grade separation from the railroad tracks there; and a major new interchange where West Virginia Avenue, Montana Avenue, and New York Avenue NE meet. The Brentwood Road realignment (essentially, the creation of 9th Street NE and Brentwood Parkway NE, to connect Brentwood Road NE with 6th Street NE Extended) was complete in September 1942 with the opening of the 9th Street NE Bridge. Receiving Home for Children Ivy City became the location of the District of Columbia Receiving Home for Children in 1949. The city began operating a facility for the temporary housing of mentally ill, violent, abandoned, addicted, or criminal children in 1928. The Receiving Home was charged with taking temporary care of individuals under the age of 18 who had become wards of the state. Long-term housing and care, defined as anything longer than a few weeks, was provided by the agency to which the child was assigned (such as St. Elizabeths Psychiatric Hospital, the city youth detention center, or a foster home). Originally located on the 800 block of Potomac Avenue SE, the Receiving Home moved several times over the next two decades. The agency generally leased former homes, office buildings, or warehouses for use, renovating them as needed, but the city recognized that such efforts were only temporary and that a custom-built structure, with good security as well as treatment facilities, was needed for children assigned temporarily to the Receiving Home. After extensive debate among city officials and members of Congress, the D.C. Receiving Home for Children was opened in January 1949 at 1000 Mt. Olivet Road NE. Although $335,000 ($ in dollars) was spent constructing the facility, the cost of the Receiving Home proved much greater than the amount budgeted and the facility was only partially completed. As built, the two-story, three-wing structure contained a kitchen, several serving pantries, laundry room, recreation room, and medical treatment room. A maximum of 46 individuals could be accommodated. The medical room was only able to render first aid, and no medical staff were assigned to the Receiving Home. Security was minimal, and escapes were frequent. In 1954, Congress appropriated $550,000 ($ in dollars) to finish the Receiving Home for Children. But the city refused to spend the money, arguing that the structure had so deteriorated since 1949 that it should be condemned and a far greater sum of money spent on building a much larger facility elsewhere. This meant the Receiving Home for Children continued to be used, and continued to provide substandard housing and care for its wards. By 1955, an average of 100 to 110 children were staying in the Receiving Home each night. The facility continued to exist into the 2010s. Now known as the Youth Services Center, the facility had expanded to 88 beds, although it still often housed more children than intended. Development and Ivy City=Industrialization and decline of the railroad The Hecht's Warehouse in the 1990s. After the establishment of the B&O; rail yard, Ivy City attracted a large number of rail yard workers as residents. This allowed the neighborhood to thrive. Nonetheless, Ivy City received few services from the city. In the 1920s, there was a single fire alarm callbox in the entire neighborhood, and the city had installed only a second main sewer line. But residents were dismayed when the city built a trash incinerator in 1928 at the junction of Mt. Olivet Road and West Virginia Avenue NE.; As of 1931, only a single road (West Virginia Avenue NE) led gave access to Ivy City. Industrial development in Ivy City began in the 1930s. The District of Columbia was only the second municipality in the United States (after New York City) to adopt a zoning code. With the Zoning Act of March 1, 1920, Congress authorized the District government to establish zoning and created a District of Columbia Zoning Commission to oversee zoning rules, regulation, implementation, and enforcement. The New York Avenue Corridor and Ivy City were zoned for combined use, which meant residential, retail, and industrial uses were all permitted. Once New York Avenue NE was paved in 1931, numerous filling stations quickly lined the street. Over the next three years, a number of industrial concerns opened in the neighborhood: A Washington Milk Bottle Exchange cleaning facility and glass factory on Fenwick Street south of New York Avenue; the offices of Mitchell & Unsinn, a construction firm, at 2006 Fenwick Street; the offices of R.E.A. Cleaning, an industrial cleaning firm, at 1925 New York Avenue; and the Nehi bottling plant at 1923 New York Avenue. In mid-1934, the F.P. May Co., a hardware retailer, opened a large warehouse at New York Avenue and West Virginia Avenue. By the end of the year, Greyhound Bus Lines had constructed a bus station at 1900 New York Avenue NE, occupying of the street. The Youngsborough Syndicate, a group of real estate investors, also purchased a large number of parcels along New York Avenue, Fairview Avenue, Gallaudet Street, and Fenwick Street with the intention of creating an industrial park. The Miller Casket Co., a coffin manufacturer, also opened a factory on New York Avenue between Kendall Street and Fenwick Avenue. In 1937, the Hecht Company constructed a warehouse at 1401 New York Avenue NE. Described by The Washington Post as the pinnacle of industrial design, the structure was built in the Streamline Moderne architectural style. The six-story building made extensive use of glass brick along its exterior walls, culminating in a seventh-story glass brick tower which was brilliantly lit at night. During World War II, Ivy City became a backwater. Little attention was paid to the neighborhood, and the war effort meant that the railroad's needs took precedence over that of the average resident. Industrial buildings, warehouses, vehicle storage lots, and junkyards proliferated in Ivy City. As World War II came to a close, Ivy City's infrastructure was also beginning to deteriorate. Residents complained about poorly paved streets, a lack of sidewalks, no street lighting, crumbling and trash-filled alleys, and a complete lack of stormwater drainage. (Until the 2000s, Ivy City continued to be particularly hard-hit by stormwater flooding. The intersection of West Virginia Avenue NE and Mt. Olivet Road NE was inundated every time there was significant rainfall.); In 1949, the railroad announced a $1.2million ($million in dollars) project to add a new roundhouse for diesel locomotives at Ivy City and improve repair shops. The project also provided for transfer of the coal-fired steam generating plant to Eckington, alleviating much of the smoke and ash problem at Ivy City. Ivy City began a significant decline in 1953. American railroads, which until this time had used coal-fueled locomotives, began switching to diesel fuel or using overhead electrical wires for powering engines. By the end of the year, almost no coal-fed locomotives were using the Ivy City rail yard. Although coal-fueled engines required frequent refueling, a diesel train could go for as many as three days without needing more diesel fuel. Steam-powered locomotives required almost daily tune-up and repair, but diesel-fueled engines rarely did. Significant layoffs at the Ivy City Yard occurred, deeply affecting Ivy City itself were many of these workers lived. The eastern roundhouse and a number of tracks were demolished in early 1954, and by 1956 the coal wharf and ash pits were also gone. As the railroad laid off workers, Ivy City also declined as a neighborhood. The proposed Inner Loop As unemployed residents began leaving Ivy City and housing stock declined due to disrepair, city planners considered the neighborhood expendable. In 1959, the government of the District of Columbia proposed building an interstate highway through the center of the neighborhood. This was the Inner Loop‚Äîthree concentric highways centered on the National Mall. The first was planned to run in a rough oval about from the Mall. The second was projected to run from the Lincoln Memorial, along Independence Avenue SW and Maine Avenue SW to the Washington Channel, where it would follow the riverbank to East Capitol Street before cutting north and then northwest (in part following Mt. Olivet Road) through the Trinidad and Ivy City neighborhoods. It would follow the rail line north to Missouri Avenue NW, then cut west along Military Road NW before reaching Nebraska Avenue NW. Then it would turn south down Nebraska Avenue NW and New Mexico Avenue NW before terminating in Georgetown. The third highway would encircle the District of Columbia at various points some miles outside the city limits. Two additional highways were included in this plan. One was the \\"Center Leg\\", a new segment of Interstate 95 (now signed Interstate 395) to begin at about E and 2nd Streets SW and continue north through the city before joining with I-95 in Maryland.; The other was the New York Avenue Industrial Freeway, four northbound and five southbound lanes of limited-access highway running along New York Avenue NE from the proposed junction with I-395 at Florida Avenue NE and running to the District-Maryland line. New bridges across the Potomac River (such as the proposed Three Sisters Bridge) would feed traffic into the system. The Whitehurst Freeway portion of the Middle Loop was first proposed in 1941. The Middle Loop plan, including its passage northwest through the center of Ivy City, was first proposed in 1946 in a study of the D.C. highway system conducted by the J. E. Greiner Company for the city government. Subsequent studies by the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) (1959), Clarkson Engineering Co. (1961), National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) (1961), National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA) (1962), J .E. Greiner Co. (1964), NCPC (1965), and J. E. Greiner Co. (1966) appeared between 1959 and 1966. Similar studies, by the J. E. Greiner Co. (1946), by the FHA (1959), Clarkson Engineering Co. (1960), NCPC (1961), NCTA (1962), J. E. Greiner Co. (1964), NCPC (1965), and J. E. Greiner Co. (1966), appeared during the same time period, laying out and reiterating support for the New York Avenue Industrial Freeway. By 1966, however, opposition from local residents had not only led to serious restudy of the proposed route, but had brought construction of almost all highways and interstate freeways in the city to a halt. The Inner Loop alone would have displaced 350 families and 26 businesses in Ivy City. But unlike residents in most neighborhoods, those interviewed by The Washington Post in 1967 were happy to see Ivy City destroyed by the highway. The housing was too dilapidated and the crime too severe, these residents said. Nevertheless, protests and pressure on Congress to end the program continued until the entire all unbuilt highways were cancelled in 1977. Rapid decline, 1960s and 1970s By the mid 1960s, Ivy City was one of only a few industrially zoned spaces left in the District of Columbia. Just a few years later, even light industry was leaving the area. The large ironworks at 1240 Mt. Olivet Road had closed, and was now a camera repair shop. Ivy City was in steep decline. In the past several years, only three new structures had been built in the neighborhood (one of them being Bethesda Baptist Church), and home ownership in the area was very low. Most residents rented their homes, which consisted of small apartment building, industrial structures converted to tenements, and cramped rowhouses. The neighborhood was noisy at all times of the day and night, and fighting in the streets was common. By the 1970s, Ivy City had declined so strongly that District officials targeted it for Model City reconstruction. The Model Cities Program was a federally funded effort which allowed local residents to redesign, revitalize, and reconstruct neighborhoods most severely affected by poverty. The D.C. government focused its Model City efforts on the neighborhoods of Ivy City, Trinidad, Shaw, and Stanton Park. The goal was to renovate distressed housing and turn it into federally subsidized low-income housing. Ivy City was chosen because the neighborhood had seen a severe decline of 20,000 residents since 1960, leaving just 80,000 people living there. This meant there was a good deal of unoccupied housing to renovate. Low-income housing was desperately needed there, as the birth rate in Ivy City was a shockingly high 49.4 per 1,000, with most households led by a single mother. Residents in Ivy City were also extremely poor, with 22,000 of the neighborhood's residents earning less than $3,000 ($ in dollars) a year. In 1971, the crime rate in Ivy City was among the highest in the District of Columbia. On June 21, 1970, the Penn Central Railroad, which had inherited the B&O; tracks and was one of the largest private companies in the United States, declared bankruptcy. With the railroad still in bankruptcy in 1972, the District government considered condemning the former B&O; rail yard at Ivy City and using the land to construct an industrial park. But nothing came of this proposal. Ivy City continued its steep decline through the 1970s. The neighborhood was increasingly poor: Median household income was just $5,333 ($ in dollars), compared to $9,738 ($ in dollars) elsewhere in Ward 5. While just 12 percent of individuals living in Ward 5 were poor, almost all of them lived in either Ivy City or adjacent Trinidad. Despair was a major issue for residents there. By 1979, almost no Ivy City residents turned out to vote in city elections. Redevelopment proposals of the 1980s and 1990s Bus parking lots off New York Avenue NE in Ivy City in the 1970s. By 1981, Ivy City had shed another 75,000 residents, leaving just 5,000 people living there. D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, attempting to alleviate the economic distress caused by the early 1980s recession, announced in early 1984 that he had targeted Ivy City for a major revitalization effort. The neighborhood was still overwhelmingly industrial, with the city having located its animal shelter and a vehicle inspection lot in the area. The area skyline was dominated by the chimney of the now-dormant trash incinerator. There was an extensive amount of abandoned property, and what housing remained was often overcrowded and in extreme disrepair. At 12 percent, the home ownership rate in Ivy City was the worst of any neighborhood in the District (where the rate of home ownership was about 33 percent). The Ivy City population was highly transient, and the rate of drug and alcohol addiction was high. Fifty percent of all households in Ivy City were led by a single mother, a large percentage of the Ivy City population were high school dropouts, and unemployment was extremely high. About 20 percent of Ivy City residents received public assistance, and infant mortality was 38.3 per thousand, double that of the rest of the District of Columbia. Ivy City was also a food desert, with the nearest supermarket more than away (an hour's bus ride) and only a single convenience store. Ivy City also became notorious for its open air drug markets. The District of Columbia National Guard even used arc lamps to illuminate streets and alleys in Ivy City at night in order to discourage drug dealers.; The Barry administration's revitalization plan for the 16-block community focused on public housing. Since about 1980, the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) had constructed 64 apartment units on Mt. Olivet Road. Now DCHA began construction on the Western Mews, a publicly owned housing rowhouse project on Capital Avenue. It was also ready to begin construction on 24 townhouses, each with two to four bedrooms, on Capital Avenue as well. But the construction of public housing did not alleviate the problems in Ivy City. The population had crashed to just 2,000 residents over 12 blocks. Ivy City was one of just three neighborhoods in the District with combined zoning, which hampered its residential and retail nature, and most people who lived there worked for either the railroad or for trash hauling firms. In August 1986, D.C. City Council member William Spaulding (who represented Ward 5) was booed off the stage at an Ivy City block party by residents angry at the lack of progress in Ivy City. (Mayor Barry, forewarned of the neighborhood's mood, declined to appear.) Leaders of Mandala Inc., a nonprofit long active in the community, denounced Barry and Spaulding and decried the terrible housing conditions still extant in the neighborhood. At least 40 percent of property in Ivy City, they said, was either vacant or should be condemned. Mayor Barry reacted to the incident by announcing a few weeks later the formation of a task force to oversee Ivy City's revitalization. In 1986, families of those placed at the Receiving Home for Children sued over the poor conditions there. A federal court found that the facility had violated the constitutional rights of the children there by housing an average of 71 individuals a night at the Receiving Home. Staffing ratios were 1 staff person for 10 children, and on particularly bad days could worsen to 1 to 15. The court ordered the city to house no more than 38 children, ordered a fine of $1,000 a day for every day the facility held more than 38 children. By the early 1990s, Ivy City was suffering from a proliferation of liquor stores and illegal dumping. The neighborhood once more hosted an incinerator, this one operated by Browning-Ferris Industries. The plant, located at the corner of New York Avenue NE and Fenwick Street NE, accepted several truckloads of biomedical waste each day and burned it. Nor had conditions at the Receiving Home improved. On May 18, 1994, Vincent Orange launched his first run for the Ward 5 city council seat in Ivy City. Orange, making his third run at the council (he'd previously campaigned for council chair in 1991 and 1993), sought to unseat incumbent Harry Thomas, Sr., who had represented Ward 5 since 1987. Orange lost the race, but easily won a rematch in 1998. In 1996, Mayor Barry proposed a second plan to revitalize Ivy City. This plan emerged from a 37-member task force set up to study the District's traffic and transportation problems. In particular, the panel studied New York Avenue NE, which carried 100,000 vehicles a day (the city's second-busiest street after Kenilworth Avenue NE). New York Avenue, the group argued, should be the preferred route for Marylanders accessing the Washington Convention Center and MCI Center downtown, and needed to be improved and traffic speeded up along the route so that tourists and business travelers would feel comfortable using the street and U.S. Route 50 to access Baltimore‚ÄìWashington International Airport. Their $2 billion plan included construction of a light rail line along the street from the Mount Vernon Square Metro station to the Fort Lincoln neighborhood; construction of a tunnel beneath New York Avenue, with only limited access points, to carry commuter traffic between Florida Avenue and the Maryland line; a commuter rail station at Ivy City to separate commuter rail from other railroad traffic at congested Union Station; a \\"relief road\\" paralleling New York Avenue from South Dakota Avenue NE to North Capitol Street to get local commercial traffic off the avenue; and use of the air rights over the Ivy City Yard for the construction of a platform that would provide parking, office space, and an entertainment venue. The plan was an immediate non-starter, however, as the cost was prohibitive. Ivy City's problems appeared to worsen in March 1997 when American Environmental Solutions, a trash hauling firm, opened a trash collection and transfer station at 1000 Kendall Street NE. Residents of Ivy City were outraged, and their anger worsened when they discovered in May that the city did not require a permit for trash transfer facilities in combined-zoning neighborhoods. City officials, however, agreed to sue American Environmental Solutions on behalf of Ivy City residents. In August 1997, a D.C. Superior Court judge held that the city could order the trash transfer station closed under general nuisance and public health laws. In 1998, just 12 years after its construction, the city tore down the Western Mews public housing complex. Western Mews had been poorly run, rarely maintained, and had become so dilapidated and infested with rodents and insects that it could not be salvaged and had to be demolished. West Virginia Avenue NE, still the only major route into Ivy City, was still in serious disrepair as well. A serious environmental issue occurred in Ivy City in 1999. In March, the city accused Hartford Knox Street Associates, owner of six apartment buildings in Southeast D.C., of illegally dumping 110 bags filled with asbestos-laden insulation in an alley in Ivy City. District of Columbia Department of Public Health officials said the company had removed the insulation without proper safety procedures from its buildings, and then dumped them in an area where residents could come into contact with the cancer-causing asbestos. Early 2000s controversies A VRE train parked in the Ivy City rail yard. VRE purchased this part of the rail yard in the early to mid 2000s. Ivy City remained an industrial area into the 2000s. Fast food restaurants, commercial printers, automobile repair shops, and used auto parts stores were common in the neighborhood. Much of the 1300 block of New York Avenue NE was used as a parking lot for city school buses, and the former playground of the Crummell School was used as a District of Columbia Department of Public Works vehicle storage yard. The number of people living in the area during the 1990s had declined by one-third, leaving numerous abandoned and vacant properties. In November 2001, club owner Marc Barnes opened a new, large, luxurious nightclub, Dream, at 1350 Okie Street NE. The four-story club had several extensive dance floors, semi-private space for patrons who paid for it, a number of bars, and catered to a wide range of races and age groups as well as people with musical tastes ranging from 1980s New Wave to hip-hop to Hi-NRG electronic dance music. The extreme popularity of Dream created several problems for Ivy City residents, including excessive traffic and parking problems, loud noise from patrons and automobiles, public urination, street fights, and even stabbings and gunfire. In an attempt to alleviate the parking problems, Dream began offering valet parking. To do so, it illegally closed the two blocks of Okie Street NE every night the club was open. Even individuals who lived on Okie Street had to pay $15 to park where they were legally entitled to do so. The club also illegally commandeered the loading dock at the shuttered Hecht's warehouse for parking. The club changed its name to Love in 2005, underwent a significant renovation, and opened a fourth floor. In 2002, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams announced yet another revitalization plan for Ivy City. This plan envisioned the purchase of existing but abandoned housing units, rehabilitating them, and either selling them or renting them at subsidized rates to low-income families. DCHA began purchasing distressed properties in Ivy City and offering them to developers. Developers could renovate the homes (at a profit), while DCHA would retain ownership and rent the improved property to low-income residents. To ensure that the renovated homes met the needs of existing residents, DCHA established the Ivy City Home Again Task Force, which arranged for meetings between existing DCHA tenants in Ivy City and potential developers. Residents gave their input as to which developer they preferred, opinions DCHA was bound by regulation to take into account when choosing which developer to work with. That same year, Virginia Railway Express (VRE), a commuter rail line, began negotiations to purchase of the Ivy City rail yard from the yard's current owner, CSX Transportation, for use as a train storage yard. VRE succeeded in purchasing the land, and began using it to store passenger coaches. Ivy City residents discovered in September 2003 that the District government intended to establish a homeless shelter at a warehouse at 1355‚Äì1357 New York Avenue NE. The move came about as the city announced the closure of its existing homeless shelter in the Gales School, a closed elementary school at 65 Massachusetts Avenue NW, in order to establish a center for abused children there. The city already leased the warehouse and had converted it into a halfway house for criminal offenders. After attempting to purchase the land, the city exercised eminent domain over it and seized it at a cost of $3.35 million ($ in dollars). Ivy City residents were angered that their neighborhood, which already suffered from a high level of vagrancy, would attract a large number of homeless people. Despite extensive protests from Ivy City residents, the homeless shelter opened in mid-December 2003. The 200-bed facility also had a kitchen, laundry, and office space. A month later, the District government announced it was building two group homes for mentally disabled adults on the 1800 blocks of Kendall Street NE and Corcoran Street NE. The city also began construction on an 80-bed juvenile detention center at 1000 Mount Olivet Road NE. Many Ivy City residents denounced both plans, arguing that the city was using the neighborhood as a \\"dumping ground\\" for the city's problems. By 2004, conditions in Ivy City had not materially improved since the 1980s, and in some cases had worsened. Almost one-third of the neighborhood's 6,000 residents lived below the poverty line, with a neighborhood median income of just $27,871 ($ in dollars), more than 40 percent lower than the citywide median income of $44,180 ($ in dollars). The city appeared to hold out little hope for Ivy City. In late 2004, Deborah Crain, and official in the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, argued that all residents of Ivy City should be relocated, and the entire area razed for new commercial or industrial development. In 2005, the Office of Planning in the D.C. Mayor's Office commissioned a $100,000 study, Northeast Gateway: Many Neighborhoods, One Community, which once more laid out an argument for rapid and intense revitalization of Ivy City. The report recommended that the city redevelop a portion of the neighborhood into a site suitable for a big-box store, and that the city encourage the various auto repair and auto parts stores to work together to build an \\"auto mall\\" where these businesses could operate in one place (rather than scattered about the neighborhood). The report also recommended that the city build a recreation center and improve the amount of affordable housing in the area. Mid-2000s housing bubble and the adult club controversy Economic conditions in Ivy City began to improve in 2005 as the United States housing bubble began to strengthen. By July 2005, land values in the area had risen appreciably. High-income home buyers began purchasing properties in the neighborhood, driving up prices. By November 20 percent of all home buyers in Ivy City had an income of $75,000 ($ in dollars) or more. Rents rose sharply as property values rose, driving out elderly people on fixed incomes. Developers began flipping older properties and turning industrial buildings into condominiums. By mid-2006, the housing bubble was still going strong, and home prices in Ivy City were still surging.; Some new homes sold for as much as $400,000 ($ in dollars) or more. In February 2006, a major controversy erupted over the relocation of several strip clubs, nearly all of them catering to gay patrons, to Ivy City. The clubs were being forced to move from their long-time locations in the Navy Yard district (a run-down, industrial and warehouse area) due to redevelopment and the construction of Nationals Park, the new home of the Washington Nationals major league baseball team. The controversy erupted after openly gay D.C. City Council member Jim Graham announced he was sponsoring legislation to allow all eight strip clubs displaced by stadium construction to move to any location zoned for commercial or industrial use so long as it met already-established rules regarding location (e.g., not near schools or residences). Graham's bill temporarily lifted a city requirement that such moves be approved by the District of Columbia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC Board). Vincent Orange, the council member representing Ward 5, immediately called a meeting of local residents to inform them about Graham's bill. The tone of the meeting, held at a local church, became angry when gay businessman Bob Siegel announced he was considering purchase of a warehouse for use by a gay strip club at 1216 Mount Olivet Road NE. Residents decried the effect that nudity would have on the morals of local youth, and the gay clubs were accused of bringing bestiality into the neighborhood. One resident, noting that gay strip clubs often distributed condoms and personal lubricant free to customers, denounced the clubs as \\"pleasure pit[s]\\". Kathryn Pearson-West, a Ward 5 community activist, accused Graham of \\"picking on\\" a new council member (Thomas was in his year as Ward 5 council member) and low-income people. Some Ivy City residents argued that racism was at issue, that the city would never have considered putting a cluster of gay strip clubs in a white neighborhood. The club owners said that homosexuality was the real reason for the opposition. Philip Pannell, formerly the liaison to the LGBT community for Mayor Williams, later went much further, angrily denouncing opposition to the clubs as \\"sheer homophobia\\", saying that many Ivy City residents \\"don't fear gay people, they just hate them.\\" Siegel did not purchase the property on Mt. Olivet Road, but did purchase 2120 West Virginia Ave NE and 2046 West Virginia NE. Two other properties were also purchased by gay strip club owners. In May 2007, 50 residents of Ivy City personally lobbied D.C. City Council members against Graham's bill. Over the next month, Ivy City residents held neighborhood rallies and distributed fliers to local residents to drum up opposition to the clubs. In 2006, the Hecht's Warehouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places. On June 5, 2007, the D.C. City Council passed the Graham bill, but with a key new restriction: The bill allowed no more than two adult businesses to move into a given ward. With one adult business already situated in Ivy City (the Skylark Lounge, a strip club for heterosexuals located at 1943 New York Avenue NE) only one additional club could enter Ward 5. With Siegel already having purchased property for his 2120 Club (a gay strip club), that prohibited any other adult clubs, gay or straight, from relocating to Ward 5. But in June 2007, the 2120 Club was shuttered by city officials after the D.C. Zoning Commission discovered that Siegel had listed his property as \\"office space\\" rather than an adult business. (A gay adult bookstore and sex club, Glorious Health Club and Art Gallery, moved into the location shortly thereafter.) Council member Harry Thomas, Jr. later significantly altered his opposition to strip clubs in July 2011, when he endorsed heterosexual strip clubs in Ward 5‚Äîso long as they were \\"upscale\\". That year, the ABC Board approved an alcohol license for a new straight strip club, Club AKA 555, located at 2046 West Virginia Avenue NE. Ivy City residents, who remained largely unaware of the club's application, accused the ABC Board of turning Ivy City into a \\"dumping ground\\" for strip clubs and attempting to make the neighborhood \\"an unofficial red light district\\". A new citizens' group, the Ivy City Neighborhood Improvement Association, filed suit with the ABC Board to have the club's license revoked. The case remained unresolved as of August 2015. (Thomas later became the first sitting D.C. City Council member to be charged with a felony on January 4, 2012. He was convicted of embezzling more than $350,000 ($ in dollars) in government funds and filing false tax returns. He was sentenced to 38 months in a federal prison and three years of probation.) The housing bubble burst in late 2007, leading to the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. Home mortgage foreclosures in Ward 5 were the highest in the city. As property values plunged in Ivy City, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty announced a new program in which four developers would transform 37 city-owned distressed properties (apartments and houses) in a six-block area of Ivy City into market-rate and subsidized housing for low-income families. In 2009, the District began implementing the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which was part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (signed into law on October 3, 2008). This program provided $3.92 billion to help stabilized neighborhoods deeply affected by the subprime mortgage crisis. The District of Columbia spent $2.8 million ($million in dollars) to help low-income residents purchase homes or save their home from foreclosure. Controversies and revitalization in the 2010s The Hecht's Warehouse in 2012, as it was about to undergo renovation. Housing prices in Ivy City remained substantially depressed into 2010. In October, Habitat for Humanity began building or renovating 38 townhouses in Ivy City. All the properties would be sold to low-income residents. The Ivy City rail yard saw new activity beginning in March 2012 when MARC Train, the Maryland regional commuter train line, began construction one three tracks at the rail yard at a cost of a $21.3 million ($million in dollars). The tracks were to store MARC trains during midday layovers, reducing the time needed to get trains to Union Station during morning and afternoon rush hours. Amtrak still maintained some offices at the Ivy City rail yard as of 2013. After the outcry against adult clubs in Ivy City, there was little opposition to the city's decision to allow medical marijuana to be grown in the neighborhood. The D.C. City Council adopted legislation permitting the cultivation of marijuana for medicinal use in the District of Columbia, and the law took effect in July 2010. Six companies were licensed to grow marijuana for this purpose, and the city granted a license to Holistic Remedies to open a cultivation facility on the 1800 block of Fenwick Street NE in March 2012. Residents did become angry, however, when D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray announced a plan in June 2012 to build a temporary parking lot on the ground of the Crummell School to accommodate 65 intercity passenger buses while a bus terminal near Union Station was being rebuilt. Area activists claimed they had not been consulted before the plan was announced, and they objected to the noise, exhaust fumes, and traffic that they said would plague their neighborhood. When Michael Durso, a staff member in the office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, met with residents in September 2012, he was verbally assaulted by Ivy City residents. When Mayor Gray declined to reconsider the plan, the citizens sued in D.C. Superior Court. The Washington Post columnist Courtland Milloy argued that Gray's action occurred because Ward 5 council member Harry Thomas, Jr. had recently gone to prison and his successor, Kenyan McDuffie, had only been in office a few months. At trial, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Victor L. Hoskins admitted that the city did not know what environmental or health laws or regulations it had to meet to relocate the bus parking, and that the cost of the temporary parking lot had never been estimated. Durso testified that at least six sites were considered for the bus parking lot, but only the Ivy City site had the proper zoning, access, and space. D.C. Superior Court Judge Judith N. Macaluso, however, ruled on December 10 that the city had \\"deliberately disregarded\\" its own laws requiring local neighborhood consultation and that the city had \\"evaded environmental screening by mischaracterizing the project\\" on zoning and business occupancy documents. The injunction was temporary, however, and a series of court hearings occurred over the next two years as the city fought to build the parking lot at the Crummell School. In an attempt to stop the parking lot relocation, Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh and Ward 5's Kenyan Duffie worked to secure $1.925million ($million in dollars) in the city's 2015 budget to fund a community center at the Crummell School. The budget deal also included $7million ($million in dollars) to renovate the structure in 2016. The court lifted its injunction in March 2014, after it found that the city was able to justify construction of the bus parking lot at the Crummell School under city and federal health and environmental laws. On April 1, 2014, Gray was defeated in the Democratic primary by D.C. City Council member Muriel Bowser, who went on to win the general election on November 5, 2014. On July 30, 2015, Mayor Bowser announced an end to the city's attempt to put a bus parking lot at the Crummell School. Instead, the city would disperse the buses to parking lots at Buzzard Point, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, and at curbside spaces around town. Ivy City still remained in a deep economic depression by 2012. The unemployment rate among neighborhood residents was nearly 50 percent. Although the city planned to turn the Crummell School into a job training center, those plans were put on hold when the temporary parking lot announcement was made. Ivy City's economy was built around the three liquor stores, two take-out restaurants, Love nightclub, and D.C. government agencies (the group home, school bus and public works vehicle parking lots, halfway house, and Youth Services Center). The neighborhood had no library, no playground, no day care facility, and no community center. Beginning in late 2012, however, Ivy City began to become a center for craft beer and distilled beverages. In December 2012, Atlas Brew Works announced it would open a craft beer brewery at 2052 West Virginia Avenue NE. Later that month, Green Hat Gin opened a distillery at 1832 Fenwick Street NE. ; A third distillery, One Eight Distilling, opened at 1135 Okie Street NE in January 2015, producing gin, vodka, and whiskey. Ivy City's long-standing stormwater drainage problems began to be addressed in 2013. The solution went back to 2005, when the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sued the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DWSA) for extensive violations of the Clean Water Act. The District of Columbia had a combined sewer system. This meant that when stormwater and sewage were both dumped into the same sewer lines. Whenever precipitation was heavy, such as during a thunderstorm, the system became overwhelmed. The system then dumped mixed water (containing raw sewage and stormwater) into local rivers and streams untreated. This happened so frequently, and in such large amounts, EPA argued it violated federal clean water laws. Under a consent decree, DCWSA agreed to spend $2.6billion ($billion in dollars) to construct six deep storage and conveyance tunnels to control combined sewer overflows into the Anacostia River, Potomac River, and Rock Creek watersheds: The Anacostia River Tunnel, the Blue Plains Tunnel, the First Street Tunnel, the Northeast Boundary Tunnel, the Potomac River Tunnel, and the Piney Branch Tunnel (also known as the Rock Creek Tunnel).; Meetings with Ivy City residents on the Northeast Boundary Tunnel construction, due to begin in 2017, began to be held in October 2013. In 2014, a major redevelopment occurred in Ivy City when the Hecht's warehouse began to be renovated into apartments and retail space. The project began to move in December 2007, when Patriot Properties, a real estate development firm based in Philadelphia, purchased the warehouse for $78.5million ($million in dollars). Patriot Properties said it would convert the property into a big-box store. But the Great Recession forced these plans to be rescinded. The bank foreclosed on the property in early 2011, and the loan was purchased by Douglas Development, a privately held local real estate development firm. In January 2014, Douglas Development president Douglas Jemal announced plans to convert the warehouse into a 300-unit apartment building. Jemal said his company would also construct more than 1,000 new parking spaces and add of retail space to the ground floor. Construction began on the parking garage in January 2014, and MOM's Organic Market became the retail space's first anchor tenant. A second major anchor tenant, local bicycle shop BicycleSPACE, moved into the retail space in February 2015, Nike, Inc. opened its first store in D.C. in the retail space on April 3, and Planet Fitness became the fourth anchor on April 20, 2015. Jemal also won a commitment from Mindful Restaurants owner Ari Gejdenson to open three restaurants (one of them serving Italian cuisine) in a space at Hecht's. The redevelopment of the Hecht's Warehouse and addition of retail led Compass Coffee, a local coffee bean roaster with its own small chain of coffee shops, to build a new coffee roasting factory at 1401 Okie Street NE in April 2015. In May 2015, restaurant and bar entrepreneur Joe Englert and real estate investor Langdon Hample purchased 1240 Mount Olivet Road NE for $1.1million ($million in dollars). They announced plans to demolish all existing structures on the site and build a $1million ($million in dollars), building that would house a Rocky Mount Bouldering Corp. sporting gear shop and gymnasium (which will include a high, bouldering climbing wall), a coffee shop, and a beer garden with an outdoor patio. The development was welcome news in Ivy City. But while the industrial sections along the neighborhood's eastern and western ends and along New York Avenue NE were improving, much of the residential area remained distressed. Nevertheless, property values began to soar significantly, with one home going for $410,000 ($ in dollars)‚Äîdouble the average home price in the area in 2013. In July 2015, the city began holding meetings with Ivy City residents to seek input on what needs the Crummell School redevelopment should meet. In May 2016, the city's first women-owned distillery, Republic Restoratives, opened at 1369 New York Avenue NE. The tasting room and distillery, located in a former warehouse, produced vodka, but would produce bourbon by 2018. About the neighborhood No public school exists within Ivy City itself. The Wheatley Education Campus at 1299 Neal Street NE (about to the south in the Trinidad neighborhood) provides both elementary and middle school education. Dunbar High School at 101 N Street NW (about to the southeast in the Truxton Circle neighborhood) provides high school educational services for local students. Ivy City is relatively isolated from the Washington Metro. The closest Metro station is the NoMa-Gallaudet U station on the Red Line, located about a block and a half from the intersection of New York Avenue NE and Florida Avenue NE (about a 30-minute walk from Ivy City). The D3, D4, and E2 Metrobus lines serve New York Avenue NE and West Virginia Avenue NE, with the D8 line serving Mt. Olivet Road NE. Ivy City is easily reached by automobile via New York Avenue NE.

As one of a small number of diamond schools, it is unique in that while its nursery and sixth form are mixed, the primary and secondary phases are single-sex.Claires Court website  History  Founded in 1960 by David and Josephine Wilding, as a day and boarding school for boys aged 6+ to 13, Claires Court grew quickly to 180 pupils by 1970.The Claires Court Review 1970 Ridgeway, originally acquired in 1964 to provide full and weekly boarding accommodation, was converted to be the junior school in 1975 when the age range at the Ray Mill Road East site was extended to 16 year-olds. By 1980 the school roll was approximately 280. Having joined the teaching staff in September 1975, their son James became Master in charge of the Senior School in January 1981; the previous August the family business had been joined by Hugh as Bursar. In 1993, the Wildings acquired Maidenhead College, an independent day school for girls, formerly known as the Convent of the Nativity. In January 2017, the school continues on three sites; a co-ed Nursery leads to separate single sex boys and girls sections providing education to 16+, the co-ed Sixth form, now in its 25th year, completes the diamond. In December 2017, Claires Court under 13 girls won the ISA London West Netball Tournament. On 28 November 2013 and 23 June 2016 the local Maidenhead Advertiser covered plans to coalesce the existing three sites onto that of the Junior Boys school. The converged site had a planned capacity of just under 1200 students. On 4 January 2018 the Maidenhead Advertiser reported that the school had applied for planning permission for the new campus. On 28 August 2019, at a meeting of the Planning Committee, RBWM councillors officially and near unanimously rejected the applications after detailed objections from local residents, who had campaigned for over three years to prevent the loss of greenbelt and against the detrimental environmental and infrastructure effects cited by the council members as the reasons for refusal. Notable former pupils Notable alumni include: Farah Zeynep Abdullah, Ali Bastian, Christian Colson, Chris Cracknell, Simon Dennis, Michael Geoghegan, Amber Hill, Nick Kennedy, Nils Mordt, James (Lord) O'Shaughnessy, Ellie Rayer, Mark Richardson, and Ben Sneesby. Current status As at the 2017 Annual School Census, 130 teachers and 50 assistants have charge of 1090 pupils, supported by a further 150 ancillary staff. The school has a successful athletics program, and several students have become national champions. Sport The School has a very successful rowing club called the Claires Court School Boat Club.

Early Ottoman prose Early Ottoman prose, before the 19th century CE, never developed to the extent that the contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose of the time was expected to adhere to the rules of seci, or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from Arabic literature (saj') and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a rhyme. Nevertheless, there was a long tradition of prose in the Ottoman Empire. This tradition was, for centuries, exclusively nonfictional in nature‚Äîthe fiction tradition was limited to narrative poetry. A number of such nonfictional prose genres developed: * the seyah√¢tn√¢me, or travelogue, of which the outstanding example is the 17th-century Seyah√¢tn√¢me of Evliya √áelebi * the sef√¢retn√¢me, a related genre that is a sort of travelogue of the journeys and experiences of an Ottoman ambassador, and which is best exemplified by the 1718‚Äì1720 Paris Sef√¢retn√¢mesi of Yirmisekiz Mehmet √áelebi Efendi, ambassador to the court of Louis XV of France * the siy√¢setn√¢me, a kind of political treatise describing the functionings of state and offering advice for rulers, an early Seljuk example of which is the 11th-century SiyƒÅsatnƒÅma, written in Persian by Nizam al-Mulk, vizier to the Seljuk rulers Alp Arslan and Malik Shah I * the tezkire, a collection of short biographies of notable figures, some of the most notable of which were the 16th-century tezkiret√º'≈ü-≈üuaras, or biographies of poets, by Lat√Æf√Æ and A≈üƒ±k √áelebi * the m√ºn≈üe√¢t, a collection of writings and letters similar to the Western tradition of belles-lettres * the m√ºnazara, a collection of debates of either a religious or a philosophical nature Later Ottoman prose * Akhtar (magazine) * Safveti Ziya Category:Ottoman culture Category:History of literature Turkish ","title":"Prose of the Ottoman Empire"},{"id":"4132335","text":"Interdisciplinary teaching is a method, or set of methods, used to teach across curricular disciplines or \\"the bringing together of separate disciplines around common themes, issues, or problems.‚Äù often Interdisciplinary instruction associated with or a component of several other instructional approaches. For example, in a review of literature on the subject published in 1994, Kathy Lake identified seven elements common to integrated curriculum models: a combination of subjects; an emphasis on projects; the use of a wide variety of source material, not just textbooks; highlighting relationships among concepts; thematic units; flexible schedules; and flexible student grouping.  Types  There are many different types, or levels, of interdisciplinary teaching. On one end, schools might employ an interdisciplinary team approach, in which teachers of different content areas assigned to one group of students who are encouraged to correlate some of their teaching (Vars, 1991). The most common method of implementing integrated, interdisciplinary instruction is the thematic unit, in which a common theme is studied in more than one content area (Barton & Smith, 2000). The example given above about rivers would be considered multidisciplinary or parallel design, which is defined as lessons or units developed across many disciplines with a common organizing topic (Jackson & Davis, 2000). One of the foremost scholars of interdisciplinary teaching techniques is James Beane, who advocates for curriculum integration, which is curriculum that is collaboratively designed around important issues. It has four major components: the integration of experiences, social integration, the integration of knowledge, and integration as a curriculum design. It differs from other types of interdisciplinary teaching in that it begins with a central theme that emerges from questions or social concerns students have, without regard to subject delineations (Beane, 1997). In 1989, the seminal work, Interdisciplinary Curriculum: Design and Implementation, edited by Heidi Hayes Jacobs was published by ASCD (Alexandria, Va). In this work, she presented a continuum of options for design spanning focused disciplined work to parallel to multidisciplinary to full integration.  Examples  * Travel and vacation can serve as a theme for cross-curricular interdisciplinary instruction. In social studies, student might study the geography of popular travel destinations, the history of tourist sites in the local community, and how travel changed dramatically during the 19th century Industrial Revolution. Analysis of travel promotion and advertising are relevant to media literacy education. Thousands of travel accounts have been published over the centuries that could be read and discussed in English classes. The impact of tourism on the environment relevant to science curriculum. In business education, students might examine the impact of tourism on the local, regional, or world economy. * An interdisciplinary unit on rivers is appropriate for elementary or middle school Language Arts, Science and Social Studies. The local river system would be the unifying idea, but the English teacher would link it to Language Arts by studying river vocabulary and teaching students how to do a research report. The science teacher might teach children about the life systems that exist in the river, while the Social Studies teacher might help students research the local history and peoples who used the river for food and transport. * Food is studied in every discipline and can serve as a theme for interdisciplinary instruction. Psychologists and sociologists explore how individuals and cultures decide what to eat, how to prepare it, and how to consume it. Anthropologists explore the meaning and symbolism of food in a culture or how food relates to social class, sex, gender, or ethnicity. Economists study the production, distribution, marketing, sales, trade, and prices of food. Political scientists examine the government food policies such as taxation, regulation and debate the government‚Äôs role in feeding its citizens. Scientists from the fields of nutrition, medicine, chemistry, biology, and agriculture study every aspect of food, from diet, health, and nutrition to chemical composition, production, and preservation. Food historians use interdisciplinary approaches to study food and its place in social class, religious practice, immigration, urbanization, technological change, the growth of the food industry, counterculture movements, and government policy.  Implementation  Heidi Hayes Jacobs presents a four-phase approach to curriculum integration planning. (1989, ASCD, Alexandria, Va) First, she suggests that a school conduct action research to learn more about how to implement curriculum integration. This should be done six months to a year ahead of when the school is going to attempt curriculum integration. Next, phase two calls for the development of a proposal. Phase three consists of implementing and monitoring the pilot unit; this should take place in the second year of the curriculum integration plan. Phase four takes place in the third year of the plan, and calls for staff adoption of the program based on the findings from phase three (1991). Choosing a theme to focus interdisciplinary instruction is a key step in implementing this approach. Themes should be of interest to students and relevant to the required curriculum. In some situations, students might choose the thematic topic. Themes should also be topics of interest to the teacher(s) because successful thematic instructions often requires additional research and preparation. Interdisciplinary themes related to multiple academic disciplines can be reinforced in lessons throughout the school day. Essential questions are helpful in focusing the theme of interdisciplinary curriculum units. Essential questions are open-ended, intellectually engaging questions that demand higher-order thinking. Essential questions help teachers chose the most important facts and concepts relative to the theme and serve to focus planning efforts. For students, essential questions highlight key facts and concepts related to the interdisciplinary theme. They also serve as a focus for analysis and evaluation. Good essential questions can not be answered with a simple yes/no or true/false; students must discuss, defend, and debate issues related to the theme. Designing interdisciplinary instruction around essential questions require students to learn both content and develop critical analysis skills.  Benefits  A school district in Michigan created integration plans for thematic units, based on the ideas of Howard Gardner about multiple intelligences, in a yearlong pilot program. The results of the program included ‚Äúsustained enthusiasm‚Äù from the staff, parents, and students, increased attendance rates, and improvement in standardized test scores, ‚Äúespecially from students with the poorest test results‚Äù (Bolak, Bialach, & Duhnphy, 2005). Flowers, Mertens, & Mulhall identify five important outcomes and findings of their experiences with interdisciplinary teaching and planning: common planning time is vital, schools that team have a more positive work climate, parental contact is more frequent, teachers report a higher job satisfaction, and student achievement scores in schools that team are higher than those that do not team (1999). Additionally, Pumerantz & Galanto find that interdisciplinary teaching allows for students to, ‚ÄúProceed at a pace commensurate with their interests, skills, and experiences‚Äù (1972). Integrated instruction helps teachers better utilize instructional time and look deeper into subjects through a variety of content-specific lens. Another benefit of integrated instruction is that teachers can better differentiate instruction to individual student needs. Integrated instruction also allows for authentic assessment (Barton & Smith, 2000). A final benefit of interdisciplinary teaching is that students have a chance to work with multiple sources of information, thus ensuring they are receiving a more inclusive perspective than they would from consulting one textbook (Wood, 1997).  Criticism  Scholars that advocate for curriculum integration argue that the topics studied should originate with students and their teachers, and not from district-imposed curriculum packages. This raises the important issue of accountability (Stevenson, 1998). As school districts often have decision- making panels that consist of stakeholders such as teachers, parents, and students, curriculum integration may take away their agency to make curricular choices. In addition to issues of local control, truly integrated curricula may or may not prepare students for the high-stakes tests that have become a reality for most high schools around the world, depending on whether they cover the same material. Finally, there is also concern that integrated teaching discounts the value of deep subject-specific knowledge, which is essential for specialization in areas such as medicine, law, and engineering (Gatewood, 1998). Thematic units can also fall short of teaching in-depth content to students. Often a theme, such as apples, is used to link unrelated subjects, with little deference to students‚Äô prior knowledge or interests. This superficial coverage of a topic can give students the wrong idea about school, perhaps missing the idea of curriculum integration in the first place (Barton & Smith, 2000). Thematic units can contain pointless busywork and activities created solely to create a link to a theme; for example, the alphabetizing of state capitals in a social studies unit, attempting to integrate it with language arts (Brophy & Alleman, 1991). Research has also suggested that some students may have less capacity to cope with broad interdicisplinary curricula that spans diverse combination of subjects from different fields.

In order to reduce this dependence, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Bureau of Energy has been actively promoting energy research at several universities since the 1990s. , in Taiwan, oil accounts for 48.28% of the total energy consumption. Coal comes next with 29.38%, followed by natural gas (indigenous and liquefied) with 15.18%, nuclear energy with 5.38%, biomass and waste with 1.13%, and energy from other renewable sources (plus hydroelectric power) with 0.64%. Taiwan has 4 active nuclear reactors. The 2016 election was won by the Pan-Green Coalition with policies that included a move toward a nuclear-free society, and is considering legislating to phase out nuclear power generation within nine years. The 2018 referendum shown a decisive victory of pro-nuclear movement, where 59% of voters rejected the idea of nuclear-free society and phase-out of nuclear power. Nuclear energy Longmen Nuclear Power Plant in Gongliao District, Taiwan. Nuclear energy is controversial, and the privatization of the energy market (with Taipower that is owned by the state), originally planned in 2001, has been postponed to 2006. Nuclear energy provides one quarter of base load power generation and 16% from overall generation in Taiwan. In 2012, nuclear power accounted for a total 38,890 GWh of electricity generation in Taiwan. Liquefied natural gas The annual output of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from exploration and production within Taiwan is 350-400 million m3. While on the other hand, Taiwan imported 18.4 billion m3 of LNG, the fifth largest LNG importer in the world, primarily from Qatar, Malaysia and Indonesia. LNG-fired power plants in Taiwan produce electricity at a cost of NT$3.91/kWh, more than the electricity cost charged to the customers. The Democratic Progressive Party Government of the Republic of China under Chen Shui-bian was elected in early 2000 promising to approve only liquefied natural gas power projects in the future, and to increase the share of liquefied natural gas of Taiwan's power generation to roughly one-third by 2010. President Chen's administration tried to stop the 2,600 MW Longmen Nuclear Power Plant, currently under construction, but a court has ruled the construction could not be aborted. In January 2013, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Shinfox signed an agreement to supply Kinmen with liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Mainland China. The delivery of LNG is expected to be started in early 2015 to industrial companies. At a later stage, the supply will be increased up to 100,000 tonnes per year to include power plants and households. The agreement was witnessed by Minister of Environmental Protection Administration Stephen Shen. Shen said that the cooperation is helpful to help Taiwan in realizing Kinmen to be a tourism- focused low-carbon county. During the third Cross-Strait Entrepreneurs Summit in Nanjing on 2‚Äì3 November 2015, executives from CNOOC and Shinfox gave a briefing on the joint venture project. Under the cooperation framework, CNOOC facilities in Fujian will also supply compressed natural gas, along with production technology. As of 2017, the safety stock of LNG imported to Taiwan is seven days. In 2017 Taiwan was the world's fifth largest importer of LNG accounting for 6% of global market share. Renewable energy Qingshui, Taichung. In June 2009, the Legislative Yuan passed a renewable energy act aimed at promoting the use of renewable energy, boosting energy diversification and helping reduce greenhouse gases. The new law authorizes the government to enhance incentives for the development of renewable energy via a variety of methods, including the acquisition mechanism, incentives for demonstration projects, and the loosening of regulatory restrictions in order to increase Taiwan's renewable energy generation capacity by 6.5 gigawatts to 10 gigawatts within 20 years. In July 2009, the Executive Yuan approved a proposal consisting of 16 measures to transform Taiwan into a ‚Äúlow carbon‚Äù country by 2020. The Ministry of Economic Affairs‚Äô (MOEA) proposal set a long- term goal of cutting total annual greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by the year 2025. The Executive Yuan also requested the legislature to complete a bill on reducing carbon emissions and another bill on developing renewable energy. NT$226 million will be used to promote renewable energy and facilities in homes and public buildings. Over the next five years NT$20 billion would be invested into advanced technologies in seven industries: solar energy, LED lighting, wind power, hydrogen energy and fuel cells, biofuel, energy information and communications technology and electric vehicles. Cooperation between local governments and the central government will be enhanced by providing incentives for conserving energy and cutting emissions. Two pilot communities will be created per county or city over 2009-2011, with 50 percent of the energy supply in those areas coming from renewable sources. In August 2009, Taiwan's government has announced that it will invest T$45 billion ($1.4 billion) in the island's domestic renewable energy sector in an attempt to help the sector grow nearly eight-fold by 2015 thereby increasing industry production value to T$1.158 trillion in 2015 compared to T$160.3 billion in mid-2009. Proponents hope that \\"the green energy sector will help Taiwan become a major power in energy technology and production, as well as provide the creation of green jobs.\\" In May 2016 Economics Minister Lee Shih-guang stated that the government expects renewable energy to account for 20% of electricity generation by 2025, to support the government's ambition to phase out nuclear power generation.  Emissions Taichung Power Plant, world's largest coal-fired power plant. Total carbon dioxide emissions nationwide were 277.645 million tonnes in 2006, representing 124.68 percent growth over 1990's 123.574 million tonnes, according to the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA). Energy conversion industry contributed to 6.9 percent of emissions in 2006, while heavy industry contributed 52.5 percent, the transportation sector contributed 14.3 percent, the commercial sector 6.3 percent and private households 12.1 percent. Taiwan ranked third in Asia and 32nd worldwide in the 2009 Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) for carbon dioxide emissions, published by Climate Action Network Europe (CAN-Europe) and Germanwatch. Energy consumption LPG tanker off of Pingtung coast Taiwan produces electricity from fossil fuels, wind, nuclear and hydro power. Taiwan's energy consumption the equivalent of 10.5 million kiloliters of oil, or about 2.2 million barrels a day. Consumption of petroleum products account for about half of Taiwan's energy supply equivalent of 4.5 million kiloliters of oil. Demand for diesel declined 21 percent, while that for gasoline dropped 8.7 percent. Monthly Power consumption is around 20.9 billion kilowatt-hours. Formosa Petrochemical Corp. and CPC Corp are Taiwan's only oil refiners. Energy use in the first six months of the year rose 6.7 percent to the equivalent of 61.6 million kiloliters of oil, the energy bureau said. Crude oil processing: 4.59 million kiloliters in June. Coal imports: 5.23 million metric tons purchases of liquefied natural gas increased 13 percent to 1.06 billion cubic meters. LNG accounted for 97 percent of gas supply. Imports of crude oil: 26.9 million kiloliters LNG purchases: 5.58 billion cubic meters. In 2013, coal imports to Taiwan amounted 65.96 million tons, which consists of 58.96 million tons of steam coal and 7.02 million tons of cooking coal. The largest coal exporter country to Taiwan is Indonesia (41.64%) and Australia (40.20%). LNG is natural gas that is chilled to liquid form, reducing it to one six-hundredth of its original volume at minus 161 degrees Celsius (minus 259 Fahrenheit) for transportation by ship to destinations not connected by pipeline. It is turned back into gas for distribution to power plants, factories and households.  Energy efficiency  Efficient-Usage of Electricity Logo by Taipower The Taiwan government has been active in promoting energy efficiency, and set a target of energy efficiency of 33% by 2025. This target is higher than Japan's commitment to APEC with the target of 25%-26% efficiency. The government is currently assisting 200 major energy users (companies and organizations) in implementing energy-saving measures. Taiwan is preparing for the age of high oil prices, and is proactively developing clean energy, such as solar and wind power and biofuels. The efforts would help reduce Taiwan's reliance on imported oil, while contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases. The government aims for renewable energy to account for 15% of the nation's energy by 2025. It would amount to 8.45 million kilowatts, capable of producing 28.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity. Wind-generated power could create as much as 8.9 billion kilowatt hours of electricity by 2025, comparable to 2.3 times the capacity of Linkou's thermal power plants. Many domestic companies are now beginning to work on the development of solar energy, and conservative estimates are projecting that 1.2 billion kilowatt hours of electricity will be produced through solar power by 2025. Under the Energy Management Law and the underlying Implementing Regulations and related measures, companies are encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their operations and products. Mandatory programs have been established for the purpose of energy conservation, including energy audit and energy efficiency standards for certain electrical and electronic products. The Energy Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for formulating and implementing energy policy and laws, including the programs instituted under the Energy Management Law. The principal responsibilities of the Energy Commission include: # supervising general affairs related to energy management to assure the stability of energy supply; # accelerating the rationalization of energy pricing; # promoting the effectiveness of energy utilization; # preventing energy-related environmental pollution; and # enhancing energy research and development. The day-to-day work of the Energy Commission involves activities such as the development of policies and regulations, planning and conservation, research and development of technology, and data collection, processing, and publication. Through the Greenmark program set up by the Fundamentals for Promoting the Use of the Taiwan Ecolabel, a number of energy- using appliances have been granted Ecolabels. For the electronic products, energy efficiency is one of the most important criteria for granting Green Marks. For further details, refer to the section on packaging and labeling. The Statute for Upgrading Industries also provides incentives for the improvement of energy efficiency.  Hydrogen fuel cell  Hydrogen-powered fuel cell research started fairly late in Taiwan when the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) began its research on fuel cell technology in 2001. The ITRI's current focus is on proton exchange membrane fuel cells, especially 3-kilowatt class fuel cell power systems, which are suitable for most Taiwanese households' average energy consumption. Presently, the high cost of manufacturing this type of fuel cell is still the most serious obstacle. It is estimated that Taiwan will catch up with other nations and mass-produce fuel cells between 2015 and 2020.  Bioenergy  Biodiesel, a diesel-equivalent made from vegetable oils or animal fats, is considered a practical option for the island. Biodiesel's greatest advantages are that it can be distributed through existing diesel infrastructure and be used in conjunction with petro-diesel after an inexpensive engine conversion.  Energy research  The Center for Energy Research (CER) at National Central University has initiated a plan to educate energy professionals. It would coordinate professors from related disciplines and build a diversified teaching platform to recruit young students and researchers. Educating young scientists in the field of green technology and encouraging them to create innovative products will provide Taiwan with an edge in the international market. *Energy Technology and Management Research Center at National Chiao Tung University *CER at National Central University *New Energy Research Center at National Taiwan University Currently there are four nuclear research centers in Taiwan ranging up to 2.8 MW. Dr. Yuan Tseh Lee is alumni of National Tsing Hua University and actual Taiwanese Nobel Prize scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using with scientific method and with understanding on laws of thermodynamics looking for energy sources with high net capacity factor as base load power source and low carbon footprint.

First foundation Dedo V of Wettin founded the monastery, dedicated in 1168. Henry the Illustrious, Margrave of Meissen made a gift of it in 1278 to the Teutonic Order. In 1543 the abbey with all its possessions came into the hands of the territorial prince, Maurice, Elector of Saxony. It was eventually dissolved in 1570. Castle After the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48) the lords of Sch√∂nburg built a Baroque castle (Schloss Wechselburg) on the foundations of the ruined abbey, which remained in the same family until their dispossession in 1945. Second foundation After the end of World War II the abbey church became the parish church and also a place of pilgrimage. In 1993 Benedictine monks from Ettal Abbey re-founded Wechselburg as a priory. Although the community is still small, they run a youth and family centre and are involved in pastoral care and managing the pilgrimages. Because of its dependency on Ettal, Wechselburg is the only non-Bavarian monastery to be a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. Basilica The Romanesque basilica of the Holy Cross remains as the parish church. It is famous for its huge and intricately carved mediaeval rood screen.

Despite this, the previous album is most commonly known as an A Wilhelm Scream album, not a Smackin' Isaiah album, as it was reissued after the name change, with the new name of the artwork, before the release of Mute Print. Seeing as it was originally released under their old name, and that this was just a reissue, Mute Print is considered their first release as A Wilhelm Scream.

Whilst the Japanese version is printed on semi-glossy paper in the standard fashion of album booklets, the original is printed on partly or fully recycled paper and opens on the left golden ratio towards the right, meaning that only the two-thirds on the right of the booklet is browsable. The remaining one third on the left remains static no matter what page you have open.

The station serves the European quarter of Brussels. Rail The rail station (called Brussel-Schuman/Bruxelles-Schuman) is an elevated station, though its northeastern end is \\"underground\\" as it enters a hillside. Its ticket office is located immediately next to the metro station; at one end of the railway station platforms, a stairway leads down to the Chauss√©e d'Etterbeek, coming out close to Maelbeek/Maalbeek metro station. Trains travelling between Brussels South station and Namur and Luxembourg call at the station. The NMBS/SNCB code for the station is FBSM. A new tunnel was opened in April 2016 between Brussels-Schuman and Meiser, providing direct connections to Brussels National Airport and stations on the East ring line of Brussels. Train services The station is served by the following service(s): *Intercity services (IC-16) Brussels - Namur - Arlon - Luxembourg *Intercity services (IC-17) Brussels Airport - Brussels-Luxembourg - Namur - Dinant (weekdays) *Intercity services (IC-17) Brussels - Namur - Dinant (weekends) *Intercity services (IC-18) Brussels - Namur - Liege (weekdays) *Intercity services (IC-27) Brussels Airport - Brussels-Luxembourg - Nivelles - Charleroi (weekdays) *Brussels RER services (S4) Aalst - Denderleeuw - Brussels-Luxembourg (- Etterbeek - Merode - Vilvoorde) (weekdays) *Brussels RER services (S5) Mechelen - Brussels-Luxembourg - Etterbeek - Halle - Enghien (- Geraardsbergen) (weekdays) *Brussels RER services (S8) Brussels - Etterbeek - Ottignies - Louvain-la-Neuve *Brussels RER services (S9) Leuven - Brussels- Luxembourg - Etterbeek - Braine-l'Alleud (weekdays, peak hours only) *Brussels RER services (S81) Schaarbeek - Brussels-Luxembourg - Etterbeek - Ottignies (weekdays, peak hours only) History The original railway line through the station site ran between Brussels-Luxembourg and Brussels North and was opened on 23 October 1856, though no station was provided. In about 1865, the Grande Compagnie du Luxembourg received subsidies from the state to open stations on the line, by that point surrounded by rapid housing development, and opened a halt called Bruxelles (Rue de la Loi), on a site now occupied by part of the Berlaymont. The station was closed in about 1920. The site was identified as a future rail and metro connection during the planning and construction of the Berlaymont and Charlemagne buildings, and opened for rail and pre-metro (underground tram) services on 17 December 1969. The pre-metro trams were replaced by the new Brussels metro on 20 September 1976. From 2008 to 2016 the station (and the metro station) underwent major renovation works, increasing the station's capacity by 2 extra tracks. These connect to a tunnel to the old Schaerbeek-Josaphat station (and marshalling yard) on line 26, in order to offer direct quick connections to Antwerp, Leuven and Brussels Airport. With this third connection, the station has become one of Brussels' largest. Its new glass roof allows more daylight into the station.

Terminology=Backcountry and wilderness within United States national parks The National Park Service (NPS) generally uses the term \\"backcountry\\" to refer to \\"primitive, undeveloped portions of parks\\". Developments within backcountry areas are generally limited to trails, unpaved roads, and administrative facilities associated with dispersed recreational use. Dispersed recreational use is the most prevalent human use in backcountry areas, although research activities may also occur. The NPS defines wilderness within US national parks as any \\"backcountry areas which have been specifically designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System or any other area that has been determined to possess the characteristics of wilderness as defined by Section 2(c) of the Wilderness Act\\". Section 2(c) states in part that wilderness: Wilderness lands within US national parks are a subset of all backcountry lands. Wilderness and backcountry lands also exist outside of US national parks on public lands managed by the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Use of the term \\"backcountry\\" in New Zealand  In New Zealand, \\"backcountry\\" often refers to land that is not accessible by public access. For example, it is common for a farmer to have some remote parts of their land left in scrubland or forest. This is often adjacent to other areas of backcountry which are yet to be developed or protected from development. Trampers and other explorers sometimes need to get farmers' permission to access parts of the national parks of New Zealand or other natural phenomena, if they intend to pass over backcountry. Hunters can ask for permission from farmers to hunt in their backcountry. Hazards The backcountry contains many hazards including rough terrain, life-threatening weather, avalanches, and wild animals. Tragic accidents and dramatic backcountry rescues of stranded hikers, climbers, or skiers are a staple of news reporting. Some jurisdictions have discussed placing limits on human access to the backcountry during times of particular danger.

Darla's first release was a 7-inch by Grifters, an indie rock/lo-fi band from Memphis.  Background  The music of the artists on the label includes electronica, indie pop, rock, and Americana. Darla is currently focused on ambient. Darla is a label, distributor, and online retailer. Darla Records is home to over 200 exclusively distributed labels including Ad Noiseam, Audio Dregs Recordings, Ici d'Ailleurs, Elefant, LTM, Le Grand Magistery, Matinee, Ohm Resistance, Siesta, and Words On Music. The label created a series, known as Bliss Out. The moniker for the series is a reference to Blissed Out: The Rapture of Rock ‚Äî a tome authored by Simon Reynolds, a notable rock music critic based in Britain. The Little Darla Has A Treat For You semi-quarterly compilation series features artists and labels Darla Records works with closely, and is very popular. This series was named after the Little Debbie snack treats. The label's moniker is not a reference to Darla Hood, the little girl from the Our Gang comedies (known as The Little Rascals on television), but comes from a yet-to-be-acknowledged bit of Americana. James noted while record collecting that many regional independent labels in the 1950s had women's names and national hits: Laurie, Paula, Sue, Tamla, etc. In the 1980s and 1990s there were popular indie-pop labels Sarah and Harriet. Since 1993, Darla has been a label and distributor. Darla started selling music online in 1996. In February 2007, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted Darla record label of the year on their 2006 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame. in 2009, Darla began offering digital downloads from their own website.

Life and career  Franti≈°ek Kmoch was born in Z√°smuky, near Kol√≠n, Bohemia. His father was a tailor and a clarinetist who performed folk music. As a child, Franti≈°ek learned to play the violin, and by the age of 10 he was already beginning to compose small pieces. In 1868 he was studying at the Teachers College in Prague, and by 1869 he had become a teacher in Suchdol, Bohemia. In addition to his occupation as a teacher, he zealously performed in several ensembles, continued to develop himself as a conductor, and composed. In 1873 he was excluded from further assignment as an instructor, allegedly because he had neglected his teaching duties, preferring instead to appear with performing ensembles at balls. It has been suggested, however, that the dismissal was a political decision, since Kmoch did not conceal his sympathies for the nationalistic Sokol athletic movement. In 1868 he became conductor of the Sokol Wind Orchestra in Kol√≠n. During the 1873 Gymnastics Festival in Prague the Orchestra played a prominent role in the opening ceremony, and visitors who attended the event warmly received the wind orchestra's offerings, both original compositions by Kmoch and arrangements of well-known folk songs. During this time he married Josefa Kahslova, daughter of a metalworker from Kol√≠n; their marriage was blessed with five daughters. The city music corps in Kol√≠n also chose him as its conductor and he immediately created a school of music attached to it. In 1882 the school gained official state recognition. Various cities, including Prague, invited him to become conductor of their respective city wind orchestras, but Kmoch preferred to remain in Kol√≠n. With his excellent wind orchestra he made excursions to Vienna, Budapest, and Krak√≥w, and even a three-month journey through Russia. He died in Kol√≠n.  Style  In reaction to the military marches of the Austro-Hungarian empire, he wrote marches that were deeply rooted in Czech tradition, folklore and folk music. In a Kmoch march, the middle section which we generally know today as the trio was almost always underlaid with texts, to be sung by musicians or choirs, or eventually the entire audience. These texts were an important expression in the development of Czech national consciousness.  Appreciation  In gratitude the city of Kol√≠n has organized a Kmoch≈Øv Kol√≠n Festival annually since 1961, which attracts prominent wind orchestras from all of Europe. A sculpture with the image of Franti≈°ek Kmoch stands in the city park of Kol√≠n, and a wind orchestra in the city still bears his name. A biographical film about Kmoch was produced with the title He was a Czech musician, and an operetta about him bears the title How Kmoch lived and played. In 1998, at the 150th anniversary of his birth, the Czech National Bank issued a 200-crown silver coin. Kmoch is considered the most popular march composer of his country after Julius Fuƒç√≠k. His oeuvre includes about 500 works.

The two main characters, Ryan (played by Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani), meet each other initially as adolescents, and later realize that their lives are intertwined through fate. Plot Jennifer Burrows (12-years- old) and Ryan Walker (11-years-old) meet aboard an airplane, and are immediately at odds. Later, Ryan is mascot to his high school, while Jennifer is elected Homecoming Queen of hers. During the halftime ceremony between the two schools, Ryan is chased by the rival mascots and loses his mascot head, only to find it run over by Jennifer's ceremonial car. Jennifer later finds Ryan and tries to console him about his costume. The two part ways once more, realizing they are too different. A year later, Ryan and Jennifer are students at UC Berkeley. Ryan is in a steady relationship with his high school sweetheart, Betty, and Jennifer is living with a musician. Ryan meets his roommate Hunter (aka Steve), a self-described ladies' man with countless elaborate (and unsuccessful) ploys for sleeping with women. Jennifer moves in with her best friend Amy after she and her boyfriend break up. Ryan and Amy start going out, and he renews his friendship with Jennifer, even after Amy has her \\"breakup\\" with him for her. They take walks, console each other over break-ups, and gradually become best friends. Jennifer even talks Ryan into dating again, as he starts seeing a girl named Megan. One night, in a cynical mood towards love, Jennifer breaks down and Ryan tries to console her. To their equal surprise, the two make love. Afraid of commitment, Jennifer says that sleeping together was a mistake, and that they should pretend it never happened. Hurt and lovesick, Ryan breaks up with Megan and withdraws into his studies. As months pass, Jennifer graduates and readies herself to travel to Italy. She encounters Ryan, whom she has not seen since their night together, at a hilltop overseeing the Golden Gate Bridge. Ryan confesses his feelings towards her, but she tells him that she does not feel the same way. He wishes her well in Italy, and leaves. On the shuttle to the airport, Jennifer passes the same hilltop where the two used to spend time together and realizes she indeed loves Ryan. She immediately races back to her apartment and finds Amy frantically getting dressed to greet her. Steve confidently strolls out of Amy's bedroom and tells Jennifer that Ryan is heading back on a plane to Los Angeles. While waiting for departure, Ryan hears Jennifer confess her love for him in Latin. After a little convincing, and feeling the wrath of a flight attendant, the two rekindle their romance where they first met ‚Äî on an airplane.

Flight Attendant Production The script was written by Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller, two actors who started writing together. They signed a deal with Miramax of which this was the first. The film reunited the director and star of She's All That. Iscove said Prinze \\"wanted to blow away that good-looking guy image and grow as an actor\\" by playing a geek. Prinze said, \\"\\"Most people won't give me a chance to play something different than the good-looking guy. But I love trying new things; I love doing something I haven't done before, and the chance to play a geek was the reason I accepted this role in the first place.\\" Prinze added that \\"I set out a goal when I was making She's All That to do three movies for a specific generation that kind of spoke to them. I did She's All That, Down to You, and Boys and Girls. Now, I've graduated from high school and college for a while.\\" Anna Friel signed to play the female lead. Friel then pulled out shortly before filming was to start due to reported \\"artistic differences\\" and was replaced by Claire Forlani. Reports differed over whether Friel was fired or quit due to unhappiness with the script. The film features a dance number similar to She's All That where everyone dances to \\"Can't Stop the Rock\\". Forlani said she was given minimal notices to do it. \\"They literally pull me into this room with 30 dancers who for two days have been learning a routine that I have to learn in half an hour. And it was really complicated, too. I was in the corner ‚Ä¶ and they ordered like, the Gap kids ‚Ä¶ and I thought, 'Oh f***, I'm doomed! And Freddie said, 'Oh, I can do it.' And I said, 'Well, that's because you're not meant to get it right.'\\"http://www.hollywood.com/general/boys-and-girls-claire-forlani- interview-57162833/ Jason Biggs made the film after his breakthrough role in American Pie. It was the first in a two picture deal he had with Miramax. Prinze said that Harvey Weinstein had wanted to put a sword fight in She's All That and on this film \\"we got a note from Harvey that said they wanted to put a sword fight into that one, too, which made no sense because it was a contemporary piece, and Jason Biggs played an architecture student! Those were the crazy notes you'd get from the studio back in the day. I don't understand how Miramax directors didn't all go insane.\\" Reception The film received mainly negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 11% based on reviews from 62 critics, with an average rating 3.8 out of 10. Box office The film opened at #6 at the North American box office, making approximately $7 million USD in its opening weekend.

Wind controllers are most commonly played and fingered like a woodwind instrument, usually the saxophone, with the next most common being brass fingering, particularly the trumpet. Models have been produced that play and finger like other acoustic instruments such as the recorder or the tin whistle. One form of wind controller, the hardware-based variety, uses electronic sensors to convert fingering, breath pressure, bite pressure, finger pressure, and other gesture or action information into control signals that affect musical sounds. Another form of wind controller uses software to convert the acoustic sound of an unmodified acoustic wind instrument directly into Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) messages. In either case, the control signals or MIDI messages generated by the wind controller are used to control internal or external devices such as analog synthesizers or MIDI-compatible synthesizers, synth modules, softsynths, sequencers, or even non-instruments such as lighting systems. Simpler breath controllers are also available. Unlike wind controllers, they do not trigger notes and are intended for use in conjunction with a keyboard or synthesizer. A breath controller can be used with a keyboard MIDI controller to add articulation and expression to notes sounded on the keyboard. For example, a performer who has pressed a long held note on the keyboard with a sustained sound, such as a string pad, could blow harder into the breath controller set to control volume to make this note crescendo, or gradually blow more and more gently, to make the volume die away. Since a wind controller usually does not make a sound on its own, it must be connected to a sound generating device such as a MIDI or analog synthesizer which is connected to an amplifier. For this reason, a wind controller can sound like almost anything depending on the capabilities of the connected sound generator. However, EWI models like the Akai 4000S have a true sound output, as well as a MIDI output. The fingering and shape of the controller put no acoustic limitations on how the wind controller sounds. For example, a wind controller can be made to sound like a trumpet, saxophone, violin, piano, pipe organ, choir, or even a barnyard rooster. History= Predecessors  Already in the 1930s Benjamin F. Miessner was working on various electroacoustic instruments. Among these was an electroacoustic clarinet, that featured an electromagnetic pickup for the reed vibration and was connected to a variety of electronic filters. Miessner‚Äôs patent , US2138500, 1936. from 1936 marks the birth of the electronic wind instrument family. Early experiments with fully electronic instruments started in the 1940s. Leo F. J. Arnold invented an electronic clarinet that featured an on/off-switch controlled by the human breath. This instrument is documented in Arnold‚Äôs patent , US2301184, 1941. from 1941. The Frenchman Georges Jenny and the German engineer Ernst Zacharias played an essential role in the development of the first analog wind controllers in the 1950s. Jenny applied his first patent , GB703733A, 1951. for an electronic wind instrument in 1951. It features a breath transducer for variable volume control, that works with a piezo element. The prototypes of Zacharias, who started to work on electronic wind instruments in 1956, lead to the first commercially produced wind synthesizer ‚Äì the Hohner Electra-Melodica, released in 1967.  Analog wind controllers Computone Wind Synthesizer Controller (essentially, Lyricon II without synthesizer) The first widely played wind controller was the Lyricon from Computone which came about in the 1970s era of analog synthesizers. The Lyricon was based on the fingerings of the saxophone and used a similar mouthpiece. It set the standard for hardware-based wind controllers with a number of features that have been preserved in today's MIDI wind controllers, including the ability to correctly interpret the expressive use of reed articulation, breath-controlled dynamics, and embouchure- controlled pitch variation. The Lyricon also expanded the playing range several octaves beyond the accustomed range for woodwind players. Tone generation on the Lyricon was limited to a dedicated analog synthesizer designed specifically to interpret various wired analog outputs from the instrument. Notable early recording artists on the Lyricon include Roland Kirk and Tom Scott. Third-party adaptations would later bring the Lyricon into the MIDI era. The next analog wind controller of note was the EWI-1000 from Akai which, like the Lyricon, was paired with a dedicated analog, voltage- controlled tone module, the EWV-2000. The EWV-2000 had no MIDI in, though it did have MIDI out. The EWI-1000/EWV-2000 pair were actually a hybrid digital/analog system. Analog signals were derived from the various sensors (e.g., key, bite, bend, etc.) on the EWI-1000 controller unit, then converted to digital signals by a front-end microprocessor in the EWV-2000. These digital signals were then altered by the microprocessor and D/A converted to internal analog control voltages appropriate for the analog synthesizer IC's within the EWV-2000. The D/A used within the EWV-2000 used a very high resolution and conversion rate, such that the responsiveness to the player felt immediate, i.e. \\"analog.\\" The subsequent EWI-3000 and EWI-3020 systems also used this A/D/A scheme within their dedicated tone modules, though these later models of the EWI would support MIDI in and out.  MIDI controller revolution With the advent of MIDI and computer-based digital samplers in the early 1980s, the new music technology ushered in a variety of \\"alternative\\" MIDI controllers. In the 1960s and 1970s, the main way for a musician to play synthesizers was with a keyboard. With MIDI, it became possible for non-keyboardists to play MIDI synthesizers and samplers for the first time. These new controllers included, most notably: MIDI drums, MIDI guitar synthesizers, and MIDI wind controllers. Leading the way to demonstrate the virtuosic potential of this new arsenal of MIDI technology on the world stage through extensive touring and big-label recordings were guitarist Pat Metheny playing the guitar synthesizer and saxophonist Michael Brecker playing the wind controller, each leading their own bands. Digital wind controllers and MIDI The most widely played purely digital wind controllers include the Yamaha WX series and the Akai EWI series. These instruments are capable of generating a standard MIDI data stream, thereby eliminating the need for dedicated synthesizers and opening up the possibility of controlling any MIDI- compatible synthesizer or other device. These instruments, while shaped something like a clarinet with a saxophone-like key layout, both offer the option to recognize fingerings for an assortment of woodwinds and brass. The major distinction between the approach taken by the two companies is in the action of their keys. Yamaha WX series instruments have moving keys like a saxophone or flute that actuate small switches when pressed. Akai EWI series instruments have immovable, touch-sensitive keys that signal when the player is merely making contact with the keys. In the hands of skilled players each of these instruments has proved its ability to perform at a high level of artistry. The now defunct Casio DH series were toy-like wind controllers introduced in the mid-1980s and had a built-in speaker (with limited sound sources) as well as being usable as midi controllers. A recent addition to the wind controller category is the Synthophone, an entirely electronic wind controller embedded in the shell of an alto saxophone. Since the electronic components take up the open space of the saxophone, it is not playable as an acoustic instrument; however, since the exterior matches that of the acoustic instrument, it is significantly more familiar to play. Additionally, keyboard- based breath controllers are also available. These modulate standard keyboards, computers and other midi devices, meaning they are not played like a woodwind, but like a keyboard, but with a breath controller (similar to a pump organ.) Yamaha's BC series can be used to control DX and EX units. Midi Solutions makes a converter box that allows any midi device to be controlled by the Yamaha BC controllers. TEControl also makes a USB device that is simply a jump drive with a breath tube attached that can be plugged into any standard computer. Software based wind controllers Through the 1990s the major hardware-based wind controllers improved through successive models and a number of minor, and less commercially successful, controllers were introduced. These controllers remained the only viable bridge between the woodwind or brass player and the synthesizer. But dating back to the 1980s a lesser known software-based alternative began to emerge. With a software-based wind controller the musician plays an ordinary wind instrument into a microphone at which point a software program (sometimes with dedicated computer hardware) interprets the pitch, dynamics, and expression of this acoustic sound and generates a standard MIDI data stream just in time to play along with the performer through a synthesizer. While the first commercial product attempting this approach dates back to the Fairlight Voicetracker VT-5 of 1985, a more successful modern approach using software on personal computers (combined with a digital audio workstation and softsynths) is relatively new. Two recent examples of this approach are Thing-1 from ThingTone Software, and Digital Ear Realtime from Epinoisis Software. Range of expression Due in part to their sensitive key switching and breath sensing systems the hardware-based wind controllers put precise demands on a player who hopes to play with technical mastery. An accomplished woodwind player may find that a hardware-based wind controller will produce an unwanted note (called a \\"glitch\\") even at the slightest imperfection in fingering or articulation technique. As the better recordings show, these difficulties can be overcome with practice. In contrast to live performance with a wind controller, and in response to these technical challenges, some \\"performances\\" in recordings are achieved through careful post-processing or note-by-note insertion and editing using a notation or sequencer program. Virtually all current synthesizers and their sound libraries are designed to be played primarily with a keyboard controller, whereby the player often reserves one hand to manipulate the many real-time controls to determine how the instrument sounds, and perhaps using a foot to manipulate an expression pedal. Wind controller players do not have access to as many of these controls and thus are often limited in exploiting all of the potential voicings and articulation changes of their synthesizers, but the technologies of physical modeling (Yamaha VL-70), sample modeling and hybrid technologies (SWAM engine) promise more expression control for wind controller players. Furthermore, sound designers are paying more attention to the different playing idioms in which their sounds will be used. For example, certain percussion sounds do not work well with a wind controller simply because playing a struck instrument it is not idiomatic to the woodwind, whereas synthesized instruments that model the acoustic properties of a woodwind will seem fitting and natural to a wind controller player. A few of the many hardware (Yamaha, Roland, Akai, Kurzweill, Aodyo) and software (Native Instruments, Garritan, SampleModeling, Sample Logic, LinPlug, Audio Modeling) synthesizers provide specific support for wind controllers, and they vary widely with respect to how well they emulate acoustic wind, brass, and string instruments. The SWAM technology, devised by Audio Modeling, has specific settings for Yamaha, EWI, Sylphyo and Aerophone wind controllers and has succeeded in producing very rapid natural responsiveness with their woodwinds and bowed strings virtual instruments. Also Samplemodeling has specific settings for wind controllers on their Kontakt-based brass. That said, virtually all current synthesizers respond to MIDI continuous controllers and the data provided by wind controller breath and lip input can usually be routed to them in an expressive way. An example of a hardware synthesizer with wind controller support is the Yamaha VL70m. However, although the responsiveness is admirable, the emulation of acoustic instruments leaves a lot to be desired. It is able to connect directly to the Yamaha WX series of controllers and via MIDI to the Akai and other controllers. Similarly, an example of a software synthesizer with support for wind controller playing is the Zebra synthesizer from Urs Heckmann. Manufacturers The major manufacturers of wind controllers are Akai, and Yamaha. Available production models include the Akai EWI5000, and Akai EWI- USB. Older models out of production include the Akai-3020, Yamaha WX11, Yamaha WX7, Yamaha WX5, and offerings from Casio including the DH-100, DH-200, DH-500 and DH-800. Martin Hurni of Softwind Instruments in Switzerland is the inventor and builder of the Synthophone. Last coming is the french Startup AODYO with their Wireless MIDI Wind Controller, the SYLPHYO. The software- based wind controllers currently in production are manufactured by ThingTone Software with a Mac OS X product called \\"Thing-1\\", and Epinoisis Software with a Windows product called \\"Digital Ear Realtime\\".  Wind controllers with saxophone fingerings =Synthophone The Synthophone is a Wind Controller synthesizer. It is a MIDI sax offering real sax fingerings and a standard sax embouchure. The MIDI hardware allows the key action as well as breath and lip pressure to be read as MIDI data. Since it is a saxophone, the fingerings are the same with some additions - Several combinations allow real-time editing of patches and harmony. The instrument has made several appearances in NAMM, including 1997.http://www.patchmanmusic.com/WindControllersAt97NAMM.html \\"'The design of the Synthophone goes back to the \\"pre-MIDI times\\" of 1981, where the first prototype (a wood-stick with Boehm-like keys) was designed by Martin Hurni. It was connected to a dedicated analog synthesizer system. This first stage of Synthophone was followed by a REAL alto sax with keys connected to a switching system to give a more realistic playing feel'\\".http://synthophone.info/indexh.htm\\"' At the ARS ELECTRONICA 1984 contest, the first prize was given to the design of the Synthophone for its \\"most original and future-oriented development in the field of electronic sound production'\\".http://www.synthophone.info After, the MIDI capable prototype was developed to increase its functionality to a Wind controller. The Synthophone is an evolution of the acoustic saxophone into the information age. The Synthophone is made by Softwind Instruments in Bern, Switzerland. Others After the Synthophone, several other MIDI saxes have been released that offer real sax fingerings: in 2019 the Travel Sax by Odisei Music, and in 2020 the YDS-150 digital saxophone by Yamaha. These MIDI saxes have sensors for breath pressure to adjust the volume, but they do not read lip pressure and thus do not allow the pitch to be controlled by the embouchure or by the manner of breathing. With the YDS-150, pitch bend can be achieved using a separate input on the instrument. Both the Travel Sax and the YDS-150 provide for settings customisation using a Bluetooth-connected mobile app. Distinguishing features The Synthophone requires different maintenance than a saxophone. It differs from other wind controllers by not having onboard presets, it must be used with a computer or MIDI synthesizer. The reed is glued to a machined metal piece (lip sensor).http://synthophone.info/reed/ The additional finger combinations allow the instrument to produce polyphonic effects to make it a chordal instrument or it can be played as a homophonic instrument.http://synthophone.info/msaxguide.htm Some other distinguishing features are selectable diatonic tonality, six chord variations (inversions, subs, number of voices, unison/chords) adjusted with lips, freeze harmony, sustain, and obligato or portamento.http://robosax.com/control.htm Programmable to change to the keys of Bb, C, Eb. The electronics are within a Yamaha YAS-275 saxophone.

There are no boundaries as to where the fugitive may go; they can cut through yards, over fences, on roofs, through businesses, houses, roads, beaches, woods, etc. This feature of the game has been disputed and altered in some areas because of legal ramifications and risk of injuries, instead players stay on roads and alleyways.https://abcnews.go.com/US/teens-playing-cops-robbers-steroids- fugitive-game/story?id=12333205 A time limit may be established for the fugitives based on the distance and difficulty, meaning they have to pace themselves in their travel. The driver's role is to transport the riders around town trying to find the fugitives. The riders and drivers may use cell phones or walkie-talkies to plan their pursuit. The drivers may not hit the fugitives; they should remain within reasonable limitations of traffic law. The riders or the drivers try to \\"tag\\" the fugitives visually with a flashlight, vocally by calling their name or yelling out their position, or physically by touching them. In some games, if a fugitive is caught before the safe zone surrounding the finish point, they become a rider, making the game more difficult for the remaining fugitives. Other times, the tagged fugitives may be shuttled to the finish point to wait for the game to end (if the cops have no room in their car, they may still have to continue on foot). If a time limit is being used, all remaining fugitives are considered busted once it is up.

He was first elected in November 1996, then re-elected in 2000 and 2004. Birkett gained national attention when he prosecuted Marilyn Lemak in 1999 for the murders of her three children. Lemak is currently serving a life sentence. He has been married to Patricia Hill since July 9, 1977, and has two children, Nick and Jackie. He is a resident of Wheaton and attends St. Daniel The Prophet Catholic Church in Wheaton. His brother-in-law is George Wendt, who is married to Birkett's sister Bernadette.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083579/bio 2002 run for Attorney General In 2002, Birkett ran for Illinois Attorney General against Democrat Lisa Madigan. Madigan defeated Birkett in the November 7, 2002 General Election with 50 percent of the vote to Birkett's 47%. 2006 run for Lieutenant Governor Judy Baar Topinka named Birkett as her running mate on 9 December 2005. On March 21, 2006, he defeated Steve Rauschenberger, Sandy Wegman, and Lawrence Bruckner in the Republican Party's primary. Topinka also won her primary race. In the November 7, 2006 General Election, Democrats Rod Blagojevich and Pat Quinn defeated Topinka and Birkett, as well as the Green Party's Rich Whitney and Julie Samuels. Appellate Court Judge On November 2, 2010 the Illinois Supreme Court appointed Joe Birkett to serve as Appellate Court Judge on the Second District Appellate Court, replacing Justice Jack O'Malley, who retired. He was sworn in on December 13, 2010. Controversy=Rolando Cruz case In 2002 Birkett's role in the wrongful prosecution of Rolando Cruz, subsequently exonerated by DNA evidence in the murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico, was partly responsible for his loss to Democrat Lisa Madigan in the race for Illinois attorney general. 2007‚Äì08 Prosecution of Iraq War protesters On July 18, 2007, The Naperville Sun published an editorial calling the state's attorney's disorderly conduct charges against two war protestors \\"heavy-handed\\". The editorial opined: > It is hard to believe that the criminal charges against Sarah M. Hartfield, > 45, of Naperville and Jeff Zurawski, 39, of Downers Grove are not at least > to some extent politically inspired in nature...We also suspect that had the > banner read \\"Support Bush and Cheney\\" instead of \\"Impeach Bush and Cheney ‚Äì > LIARS\\" the situation would have been viewed a little differently. Supporters of the defendants staged three rallies at the DuPage County courthouse. The charges were dropped when the chief witness failed to appear in court. Jeff Zurawski called the prosecution \\"vindictive\\" and requested a public apology.

It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes. By default, it uses the AES encryption algorithm in cipher block chaining (CBC) or XTS mode with a 128-bit or 256-bit key. CBC is not used over the whole disk; it is applied to each individual sector.  History  BitLocker originated as a part of Microsoft's Next-Generation Secure Computing Base architecture in 2004 as a feature tentatively codenamed \\"Cornerstone\\" and was designed to protect information on devices, particularly if a device was lost or stolen; another feature, titled \\"Code Integrity Rooting\\", was designed to validate the integrity of Microsoft Windows boot and system files. When used in conjunction with a compatible Trusted Platform Module (TPM), BitLocker can validate the integrity of boot and system files before decrypting a protected volume; an unsuccessful validation will prohibit access to a protected system. BitLocker was briefly called Secure Startup before Windows Vista's release to manufacturing. BitLocker is available on: * Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7 * Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows 8 and 8.1 * Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions of Windows 10 * Windows Server 2008 and later Features Initially, the graphical BitLocker interface in Windows Vista could only encrypt the operating system volume. Starting with Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, volumes other than the operating system volume could be encrypted using the graphical tool. Still, some aspects of the BitLocker (such as turning autolocking on or off) had to be managed through a command-line tool called \`manage-bde.wsf\`. The version of BitLocker included in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 adds the ability to encrypt removable drives. On Windows XP or Windows Vista, read-only access to these drives can be achieved through a program called BitLocker To Go Reader, if FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT filesystems are used. In addition, a new command-line tool called \`manage-bde\` replaced the old \`manage-bde.wsf\`. Starting with Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, Microsoft has complemented BitLocker with the Microsoft Encrypted Hard Drive specification, which allows the cryptographic operations of BitLocker encryption to be offloaded to the storage device's hardware. In addition, BitLocker can now be managed through Windows PowerShell. Finally, Windows 8 introduced Windows To Go in its Enterprise edition, which BitLocker can protect.  Device encryption  Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows RT and core editions of Windows 8.1 include device encryption, a feature-limited version of BitLocker that encrypts the whole system. Logging in with a Microsoft account with administrative privileges automatically begins the encryption process. The recovery key is stored to either the Microsoft account or Active Directory, allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all versions of 8.1, unlike BitLocker, device encryption requires that the device meet the InstantGo (formerly Connected Standby) specifications, which requires solid- state drives, non-removable RAM (to protect against cold boot attacks) and a TPM 2.0 chip. Starting with Windows 10 1703, the requirements for device encryption have changed, requiring a TPM 1.2 or 2.0 module with PCR 7 support, UEFI Secure Boot, and that the device meets Modern Standby requirements or HSTI validation. In September 2019 new update was released (KB4516071) changing the default setting for BitLocker when encrypting a self-encrypting hard drive. Now, the default is to use software encryption for newly encrypted drives. This is due to hardware encryption flaws and security concerns related to those issues.  Encryption modes  Three authentication mechanisms can be used as building blocks to implement BitLocker encryption: * Transparent operation mode: This mode uses the capabilities of TPM 1.2 hardware to provide for transparent user experience‚Äîthe user powers up and logs into Windows as usual. The key used for disk encryption is sealed (encrypted) by the TPM chip and will only be released to the OS loader code if the early boot files appear to be unmodified. The pre-OS components of BitLocker achieve this by implementing a Static Root of Trust Measurement‚Äîa methodology specified by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). This mode is vulnerable to a cold boot attack, as it allows a powered-down machine to be booted by an attacker. It is also vulnerable to a sniffing attack, as the volume encryption key is transferred in plain text from the TPM to the CPU during a successful boot. * User authentication mode: This mode requires that the user provide some authentication to the pre-boot environment in the form of a pre-boot PIN or password. * USB Key Mode: The user must insert a USB device that contains a startup key into the computer to be able to boot the protected OS. Note that this mode requires that the BIOS on the protected machine supports the reading of USB devices in the pre-OS environment. The key may also be provided by a CCID for reading a cryptographic smartcard. Using CCID provides additional benefits beyond just storing the key file on an external USB thumb drive because the CCID protocol hides the private key using a cryptographic processor embedded in the smartcard; this prevents the key from being stolen by simply being read off the media on which it is stored. The following combinations of the above authentication mechanisms are supported, all with an optional escrow recovery key: * TPM only * TPM + PIN * TPM + PIN + USB Key * TPM + USB Key * USB Key * Password only  Operation  BitLocker is a logical volume encryption system. (A volume spans part of a hard disk drive, the whole drive or more than one drive.) When enabled, TPM and BitLocker can ensure the integrity of the trusted boot path (e.g. BIOS and boot sector), in order to prevent most offline physical attacks and boot sector malware. In order for BitLocker to encrypt the volume holding the operating system, at least two NTFS-formatted volumes are required: one for the operating system (usually C:) and another with a minimum size of 100 MB, which remains unencrypted and boots the operating system. (In case of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, however, the volume's minimum size is 1.5 GB and must have a drive letter.) Unlike previous versions of Windows, Vista's \\"diskpart\\" command-line tool includes the ability to shrink the size of an NTFS volume so that this volume may be created from already allocated space. A tool called the BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool is also available from Microsoft that allows an existing volume on Windows Vista to be shrunk to make room for a new boot volume and for the necessary bootstrapping files to be transferred to it. Once an alternate boot partition has been created, the TPM module needs to be initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk-encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that may take a considerable amount of time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform. Encrypting File System (EFS) may be used in conjunction with BitLocker to provide protection once the operating system is running. Protection of the files from processes and users within the operating system can only be performed using encryption software that operates within Windows, such as EFS. BitLocker and EFS, therefore, offer protection against different classes of attacks. In Active Directory environments, BitLocker supports optional key escrow to Active Directory, although a schema update may be required for this to work (i.e. if the Active Directory Services are hosted on a Windows version previous to Windows Server 2008). BitLocker and other full disk encryption systems can be attacked by a rogue boot manager. Once the malicious bootloader captures the secret, it can decrypt the Volume Master Key (VMK), which would then allow access to decrypt or modify any information on an encrypted hard disk. By configuring a TPM to protect the trusted boot pathway, including the BIOS and boot sector, BitLocker can mitigate this threat. (Note that some non-malicious changes to the boot path may cause a Platform Configuration Register check to fail, and thereby generate a false warning.)  Security concerns  According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker does not contain an intentionally built-in backdoor; without which there is no way for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement. The \\"Transparent operation mode\\" and \\"User authentication mode\\" of BitLocker use TPM hardware to detect if there are unauthorized changes to the pre-boot environment, including the BIOS and MBR. If any unauthorized changes are detected, BitLocker requests a recovery key on a USB device. This cryptographic secret is used to decrypt the Volume Master Key (VMK) and allow the bootup process to continue. Nevertheless, in February 2008, a group of security researchers published details of a so-called \\"cold boot attack\\" that allows full disk encryption systems such as BitLocker to be compromised by booting the machine off removable media, such as a USB drive, into another operating system, then dumping the contents of pre-boot memory. The attack relies on the fact that DRAM retains information for up to several minutes (or even longer if cooled) after power has been removed. There is the Bress/Menz device described in US Patent 9,514,789 that can accomplish this type of attack. Use of a TPM alone does not offer any protection, as the keys are held in memory while Windows is running. Similar full disk encryption mechanisms of other vendors and other operating systems, including Linux and Mac OS X, are vulnerable to the same attack. The authors recommend that computers be powered down when not in physical control of the owner (rather than be left in a sleep mode) and that the encryption software be configured to require a password to boot the machine. Once a BitLocker-protected machine is running, its keys are stored in memory where they may be susceptible to attack by a process that can access physical memory, for example, through a 1394 or Thunderbolt DMA channel. Starting with Windows 10 version 1803, Microsoft added a new feature called \\"Kernel DMA Protection\\" to BitLocker, against DMA attacks via Thunderbolt 3 ports. Starting with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, Microsoft removed the Elephant Diffuser from the BitLocker scheme for no declared reason. Dan Rosendorf's research shows that removing the Elephant Diffuser had an \\"undeniably negative impact\\" on the security of BitLocker encryption against a targeted attack. Microsoft later cited performance concerns, and noncompliance with the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), to justify the diffuser's removal. Starting with Windows 10 version 1511, however, Microsoft added a new FIPS-compliant XTS-AES encryption algorithm to BitLocker. On 10 November 2015, Microsoft released a security update to mitigate a security vulnerability in BitLocker that allowed authentication to be bypassed by employing a malicious Kerberos key distribution center, if the attacker had physical access to the machine, the machine was part of a domain and had no PIN or USB protection. In October 2017, it was reported that a flaw (ROCA vulnerability) in a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use in security products such as smartcards and TPMs, enabled private keys to be inferred from public keys. This could allow an attacker to bypass BitLocker encryption when an affected TPM chip is used. Microsoft released an updated version of the firmware for Infineon TPM chips that fixes the flaw via Windows Update.
