They were beheaded in 1879 as a result of being Bah√° º√≠s. Numerous letters and tablets were written in their honour by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, who gave them the titles which they are commonly known as: the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs. The older brother was M√≠rz√° Muhammad-Husayn, given the title Mahb√∫bu'sÕüh-SÕühuhad√° º (Beloved of Martyrs). His brother was M√≠rz√° Muhammad-Hasan, given the title Sult√°nu'sÕüh-SÕühuhada º (King of Martyrs). The latter was identified as one of the nineteen Apostles of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. The two were both natives of Isfahan, and were both rich and highly endowed with trading acumen. They were beheaded in the city of Isfahan in 1879 as a result of three persons: Mir Muhammad-Husayn, the Im√°m-Jum'ih of Isfahan; Shaykh Muhammad-Baqir, another influential Muslim cleric of Isfahan; and Sult√°n- Mas'√∫d M√≠rz√°, the son of N√°siri'd-D√≠n Sh√°h, who governed Isfahan during the time. Background The Wolf' The brothers followed in the footsteps of their father, M√≠rz√° Ibr√°h√≠m. They had for years helped the Im√°m-Jum'ih in managing his affairs, making several payments on his behalf, which became quite a substantial amount. The brothers were merchants, and participated in a trading network with the Afn√°n (relatives of the B√°b), who had a vast and profitable network stretching from Hong Kong to the Caucasus as well as Dutchman Johan Colligan. The two brothers were well known to be selfless, upright and kindly men. Part of their success as merchants has been attributed to their record of honest and upright transactions. When they asked for the money which the Im√°m owed them, he stalled, and began to find ways of evading the payment. He met with Shaykh Muhammad-Baqir, another influential Islamic leader, and they created a plan to destroy the two of them. They approached Sultan-Mas'ud Mirza, the governor of Isfahan, and he quickly agreed to have them thrown in jail, on the grounds that they were Bah√° º√≠s. Martyrdom Sultan-Mas'ud Mirza, governor of Isfahan The two brothers were tortured, and promised release upon recanting their faith and cursing its leaders, which they never did. The collaborators wrote a letter to the Shah in Tehran, informing him that they had \\"in their concern for the security of the sovereign\\", detained and imprisoned two Bah√° º√≠s, and requested his permission to have them put to death. The Shah refused the request, and instead asked them to be sent as prisoners to Tehran. This was despite Dutchman Johan Colligan's testifying to their innocence. The Ulama then decided that the brothers would likely be set free due to their innocence. They then decided to ensure their death before departing for Tehran. They used their power as religious leaders to encourage over 50 other divines, each with his own crowd of rioters, to approach the house of the governor and demand the death of the brothers, chanting \\"Oh for our Religion!\\" The governor argued with the Ulama that the two brothers were not guilty of any treasonable act and had done nothing hostile to the State. He refused to give orders for their execution. One of the Ulama then offered to kill them with his own hands. A large sum of money was offered to the governor, which he accepted. Before the orders could be carried out, a crowd broke into the prison holding them and dragged them into the street, where they were torn apart. Rope were fastened to the corpses, and they were then dragged around the city and left at the gallows, where people continued to throw stones at them. At the close of the day, their bodies were taken to an archway, which was brought down over them. The date was March 17, 1879. They were eventually buried in the Takht-i-Fulad cemetery. Aftermath Bah√° ºu'll√°h wrote several tablets lamenting over the loss of the two brothers, and denouncing the treachery that provoked their murder. One such tablet, Lawh-i-Burh√°n, was addressed to Shaykh Muhammad B√°qir, giving him the title of the 'Wolf', and the title of 'She-Serpent' to Muhammad Husayn, the Im√°m Jum'ih of Isfah√°n. The two, along with the governor of Isfahan were the three main conspirators against the brothers. Bah√° ºu'll√°h also wrote the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf to the son of Shaykh Muhammad B√°qir. M√≠rz√° Muhammad-Hasan left behind a widow named F√°timih Begum, and a son named M√≠rz√°  ªAbdu'l-Husayn. Bah√° ºu'll√°h directed them to come to Akka so that they might be compensated for all that had passed. M√≠rz√°  ªAbdu'l-Husayn, died in the city. (Memorials of the Faithful, pg. 173) The third of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s four surviving daughters, R√∫h√° Kh√°num, married M√≠rz√° Jal√°l, another son of the King of Martyrs. She broke the Covenant in the 1940s.

The tradition of Christian fiction Christian novels have a rich tradition in Europe, which goes back several centuries, and draws on past Christian allegorical literature, such as Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress and The Holy War. Twentieth century proponents of the Christian novel in English include J.R.R. Tolkien, G. K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, and Madeleine L'Engle. Aslan in Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe allegorically represents Christ, for example, while L'Engle's A Live Coal in the Sea explicitly references the medieval allegorical poem Piers Plowman.L'Engle's title is drawn from the line \\"And all the wickedness in this world that man might work or think is no more to the mercy of God than a live coal in the sea.\\" Many novels with Christian themes also fall into specific mainstream fiction genres. For example, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is viewed as mainstream fantasy, while Julian May's Galactic Milieu Series is viewed as mainstream science fiction, in spite of the references to the work of Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Similarly, G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown stories are mainstream detective fiction, even though the main character is a Catholic priest Modern American Christian novels In the last few centuries the existence of a conservative Christian subculture, particularly in North America, has given rise to a specific genre of Christian novel. Books such as Love Comes Softly by Janette Oke (1979) and This Present Darkness by Frank Peretti (1985), combining a specific brand of conservative Christian theology with a popular romance or thriller form, have gained approval in the subculture, just as in earlier times Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ helped make the novel acceptable to conservative religious people of the day. Publication of such Christian novels has increased greatly from this beginning, and excellence in the genre is now recognised by the Christy Awards, although an article in Christianity Today recently argued that such use of popular forms risks \\"foisting on the world impoverished‚Äîeven laughable‚Äîexpressions of those genres.\\" In North America, the Christian novel has evolved into a specific genre of its own, written explicitly by and for Christians of a particular type. Such a Christian novel does not have to involve an actual event or character in Bible history. A novel can be Christian in this sense merely because one of its characters either comes to a Christian understanding of God and of man's need for salvation from sin, or faces a crisis of his or her faith. Nor does the plot need to turn on whether any given character is a Christian or not‚Äîalthough many Christian novels do have plots that explicitly reference persecution (in the past, the present, or the future), Bible history, or unfulfilled prophecy (as in the immensely popular Left Behind series). Popular authors of Christian novels include Francine Rivers in the romance subgenre, and Ted Dekker and Robert Liparulo in the thriller/suspense subgenre. Other authors of Christian novels include Karen Kingsbury, Judith McCoy Miller, Tracie Peterson, Bethany Kennedy Scanlon, Tosca Lee and Robert Whitlow. Some authors of Christian novels have received a mixed reception within the conservative Christian community. William P. Young's best-selling theological novel The Shack, for example, was strongly criticised by some reviewers. Deborah Bryan of the Kansas Library Association suggests that this genre of books typically promotes values, teaches a lesson, always has a happy ending (good prevails over evil in all books), adheres to a decency code (certain boundaries such as sexuality, strong language, and topics of such cannot be crossed), and that Christian fiction is created for defined boundaries within a particular community. She also notes that a Christian fiction writer must comply with certain restraints such as: #Accept the truthful authority of the Bible #Address dilemmas through faith in Jesus #Believe that Jesus died and rose for sins of all people #Avoid writing about certain ‚Äútaboos‚Äù Publishers of Christian novels include B&H; Publishing Group, Baker Publishing Group (whose imprints include Baker Academic, Baker Books, Bethany House, Brazos Press, Chosen, and Revell), Bridge-Logos Foundation, David C. Cook, HarperCollins Christian (Thomas Nelson) and Zondervan, Harvest House, Howard Publishing (a division of Simon & Schuster), Kregel Publications, Tyndale House, and Waterbrook Press (a division of Random House). Such novels are today marketed world-wide through Christian bookstores and online distributors, such as ChristianBook.com and Amazon.com, respectively. Urban Christian fiction Urban Christian fiction is a genre in which conflicting stories of emotion and vividness mixes God, the urban church, and faith. Violence and sex is not purposely excluded, but are included whenever necessary for the story line. God is the center of the characters lives in Urban Christian Fiction and these stories usually portray African-American or Latino urban culture. Urban Christian publishing company publishes urban Christian books along with other subdivisions of urban Christian which includes urban renaissance and urban soul. Some best-selling authors in this genre for 2012 are Kimberla Lawson Roby, Victoria Christopher Murray, Tony Dungy, Lutishia Lovely, Neta Jackson, Keyon C. Polite, Serita Jakes (Bishop T.D. Jakes' wife), and ReShonda Tate Billingsley.Urban Christian News, \\"Bestsellers List,\\" (accessed 12 May 2012) Some book titles and authors of urban Christian fiction are: Married Strangers by Dwan Abrams, Sheena's Dream by Marilyn Mayo Anderson, First Comes Love by Shana Johnson Burton, Count It All Joy by Ashea Goldson, Secrets and Lies by Rhonda McKnight, 'Til Debt Do Us Part by Michelle Larks, and Soul Confessions by Monique Miller.Hennepin County Library, \\"Bookspace,\\" (accessed 14 May 2013) Some best- selling authors in this genre for 2015 are Jonathan Cahn, (Karen Kingsbury),William Paul Young, (Sarah Price (author)), and Francine Rivers. A Christian urban title that ventures into the Young Adult/SuperHero genre is \\"In the Shadows of Myrmidons\\" by B. Lloyd Reese and Nicholas J. Rzepczynski. Urban Christian fiction is classified as part of the African-American Christian Market (AACM), where the hot-selling topics are fiction, books for dating, dramatic testimony, and single parenting. Prominent pastors of megachurches and leaders of powerful ministries contributes largely to AACM.

Monday January 3, 2011. Retrieved on January 18, 2011. The redevelopment effort was expected to take a year to complete and cost a total of almost $6 million. Due to unforeseen events, such as the theft of copper pipes from the building, the move was delayed and was not completed until the spring of 2010. A new round of investing to help finance the new brewery gave 100 investors 30% of the company at an average investment of $25,000 each. St. Arnold also received a bank loan from the Small Business Administration at a 4.17% interest rate over 20 years. The brewery anticipated brewing over 30,000 barrels in 2010, up from 26,000 barrels at their previous location. The maximum capacity of the new brewery is over 100,000 barrels.

The largest raid, one of the most devastating area bombardments of the war, was carried out by the Royal Air Force (RAF) on the evening of February 23, 1945. Some 17,600 people, or 31.4% of the town's population, were killed. About 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed, two-thirds of the complete area of Pforzheim and between 80% and 100% of the inner city. Minor raids The first Allied air raid on Pforzheim took place on April 1, 1944 when an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers caused comparatively minor damage and killed 95 people. Further attacks by the USAAF followed, the largest on 24 December. Another on 21 January 1945 caused 56 casualties.Christian Groh Pforzheim and Pforzheimer Zeitung of February 9, 2005. The RAF also carried out several nighttime nuisance raids on Pforzheim and other towns with de Havilland Mosquito light bombers. The raids, consisting of around six Mosquitos, forced the Luftwaffe to respond. They also helped confuse the defences, diverting resources away from the main bomber streams. These nuisance raids drove civilians into shelters and disturbed their sleep. Three consecutive raids occurred on the nights of October 2, 3 and 4, 1944 with a further three raids in October and one in November 1944. The RAF lost one aircraft in these raids.Bomber Command Campaign Diary October 1944 After the devastating air raid of February 23, 1945, there were smaller air raids on Pforzheim. On March 4, USAAF B-24 Liberator aircraft bombed the area around \\"Kupferhammer\\". On March 14, 16, 18th, 19th, 20th and 24th, the railway facilities were bombed. On March 17, the motorway at Pforzheim was bombed, and on March 23 the area in Eutingen Valley was bombed. Reasons for the main raid A report compiled for RAF Bomber Command dated 28 June 1944, stated that Pforzheim was \\"one of the centres of the German jewellery and watch making trade and is therefore likely to have become of considerable importance to the production of precision instruments [of use in the war effort].\\" An Allied report issued in August 1944 stated that \\"almost every house in this town centre is a small workshop\\" and that there were a few larger factories in the south and one in the north of the city centre. An attack on the city would destroy the \\"built-up area, the associated industries and rail facilities\\". There were no war-crucial targets; only war-relevant ones. In November 1944, Pforzheim was placed for the first time on a target list of the Allied Forces, but with the lowest priority of category five. In that report, the city was described as being suitable for a raid, because the road and rail communications through the easily spotted old city was known to be flammable. Pforzheim was used in the transfer of troops. Main raid The attack as seen from a British bomber The large raid that almost destroyed the inner city district occurred on the evening of February 23, 1945. The first bombs were dropped at 19:50 and the last one at 20:12. The attack on \\"Yellowfin\\", the RAF's code name for Pforzheim, included 379 aircraft. The main force bombers were 367 Avro Lancasters of No. 1, No. 6, and No. 8 Groups along with one Film Unit Lancaster, and 13 Mosquitos of No. 8 Group (the Pathfinders). The master bomber for the raid was Major Ted Swales, DFC, a South African, aged 29, who would be awarded Bomber Command's last Victoria Cross of the war for his actions on this night. Despite severe damage to his plane he remained over the target directing the raid and died when his Lancaster crashed near Valenciennes on the return flight.\\"‚ÄúHe did his Duty to the Last ‚Äì Captain Edwin Swales VC‚Äù Article by David R. Bennett. The Journal of the Victoria Cross Society. 6th Edition, March 2005, pp 42-44. The bomber stream attacked from a height of 8,000 feet (2,400 m). The bombs were a, by now, standard mix of high explosive and incendiary bombs. The town centre suffered immediate destruction and a firestorm broke out, reaching its most devastating phase about 10 minutes from the start of the raid. The smoke over the town rose to about 3,000 metres, and the returning bomber crews could still see the glare of the fire up to 160 km away. Twelve aircraft of the bomber fleet did not return to their bases. Eleven of them were shot down by Luftwaffe fighters stationed at Gro√üsachsenheim (now Sachsenheim), and another was assumed to have been accidentally hit by \\"friendly\\" bombs. At least two aircraft crashed not far from Pforzheim, and Swales' aircraft, which had been hit twice, crashed in France. One of the Lancasters that crashed near Pforzheim went down close to the village of Neuhausen (Enzkreis). Three of its crew members bailed out, of whom two survived; the remaining crew members died. The other one crashed near the village of Althengstett near the town of Calw. =Impact of the attack= The German Army Report of February 24, 1945 devoted only two lines to reporting the bombardment: \\"In the early evening hours of February 23, a forceful British attack was directed at Pforzheim\\". The post-war British Bombing Survey Unit estimated that 83 per cent of the town's built-up area was destroyed, \\"probably the greatest proportion in one raid during the war\\". In the centre, almost 90% of the buildings were destroyed. In an area about 3 km long and 1.5 km wide, all buildings were reduced to rubble. 17,600 citizens were officially counted as dead and thousands were injured. People died from the immediate impact of explosions, from burns due to burning incendiary materials that seeped through basement windows into the cellars of houses where they hid, from poisonous gases, lack of oxygen, and collapsing walls of houses. Some of them drowned in the Enz or Nagold rivers into which they had jumped while trying to escape from the burning incendiary materials in the streets, but even the rivers were burning as the phosphorus floated on the water. After the attack, about 30,000 people had to be fed by makeshift public kitchens because their housing had been destroyed. Many Pforzheim citizens were buried in common graves at Pforzheim's main cemetery because they could not be identified. There are many graves of complete families. The labour office of 1942 listed 2,980 foreigners in Pforzheim, and one source puts the number of foreign laborers who died in the bombings at 498 (among them 50 Italians). The inner city districts were almost totally depopulated. According to the State Statistics Bureau (Statistisches Landesamt), in the Market Square area (Marktplatzviertel) in 1939 there were 4,112 registered inhabitants, in 1945 none. In the Old Town area (Altstadtviertel) in 1939 there were 5,109 inhabitants, in 1945 only 2 persons were still living there. In the Leopold Square area, in 1939 there were 4,416 inhabitants, in 1945 only 13. Some surviving Allied aircrew were killed after they fell into the hands of German civilians. Four weeks after the Pforzheim main raid, the British crew of a B-17 Flying Fortress bailed out near Pforzheim where they were captured, and six of them were shot at the nearby village of Huchenfeld. One member managed to escape but was later recaptured and taken to a POW camp.Tail-End Charlies - John Nichol and Tony Rennell 2004Tom Tate - Huchenfeld - The Village that asked Forgiveness Post war Rather than rebuild the centre of Pforzheim on the old street plan, the main thoroughfares were widened after the war. The rubble from the destruction was heaped into a large, high mound on the outskirts of the town and covered with soil and vegetation. It is officially named the \\"Wallberg\\". As with other German cities which have similar mounds, it remains a visible reminder of the destruction brought upon the city during World War II.

In the US he also published under his pseudonym H.M. Baker. Credits in American comics include The Black Pearl and Ghost for Dark Horse Comics. He was a drummer for the heavy metal band GeroMetal. Professional career Kerac fell in love with comics reading Davy Crockett, Prince Valiant and Chlorophylle in the Yugoslav Kekec magazine, but what inspired him to pursue a professional career was the first appearance of Romita‚Äôs Daredevil in Zenit. Kerac debuted in 1975 with Lieutenant Tara, a WW2 comic he co-created with his childhood friend, comic book writer Svetozar Obradoviƒá. The duo went on to produce Kobra, the most popular Yugoslav title of the 1980s. Kerac‚Äôs super-heroine Cat Claw reached even greater success abroad. In addition, he spearheaded teams of writers and artists that worked on the licensed Tarzan and Blek comics. Kerac was also involved in the production of Ninja and Lun, kralj ponoƒái comics, titles based on the Yugoslav pulp novels. In between professional assignments, Kerac worked on his labor of love, Billy the Spit. Finally, he created or co-created a number of Western, war, fantasy, noir and humorous shorts, published in various anthologies. In the 1990s the local comic book industry collapsed with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Kerac turned to music and graphic design, doing occasional work- for-hire for foreign publishers. After the local scene experienced a revival in the 2000s, he returned to drawing, mostly working for publishers in France and Italy. Kerac was a member of the editorial board of revamped Stripoteka from 1999 to 2015. In 2005 Kerac was awarded Special Award to General Contribution to Serbian Comics, a lifetime achievement award at the International Comics Festival in Belgrade. Kerac‚Äôs influences include Silver Age Marvel comics as well as bandes dessin√©es, but also Western and action movies. His comics often feature a number of cameos of his friends and celebrities, humorous self-portraits, references to heavy metal music, and other Easter eggs. The character of Cameron Hill in Cat Claw was modeled after the artist. Kerac played him in a TV short titled City Cat in 1992. Personal life Kerac‚Äôs surname is toponymic and denotes a person from Ker (presently the village of Zmajevo in Serbia). Kerac lives with his family in Novi Sad. He studied stomatology but dropped out because he decided it was ‚Äúbetter to become a good artist than a bad dentist.‚Äù He met his wife Ljiljana when she was hired as a letterer. She also featured as minor characters in a few of his comics. Their son Tara was named after Kerac‚Äôs character Lt Tara. The boy in a Tarzan episode called ‚ÄúThe Boy from Stars‚Äù was modeled after him. Both the father and the son play music. From 1992 to 2000 Kerac was a drummer for GeroMetal, who released two hard rock albums - Der rauch am wa√üer in 1993 and Cat Claw in 1996. He has also done cover art for a number of other bands. His other son, Neboj≈°a, was named after Daredevil and is also a musician and graphic designer.

Etymology Paide's German name Weissenstein (originally Wittenstein or Wittensten in Low German) means \\"white stone\\". This name was derived from the limestone used for the construction of Paide Castle. A Latin translation, Albus Lapis, has also been used.√úhendus Weissenstein, Paide Linna Nimed (accessed 1 January 2013) The Estonian name Paide was first recorded in 1564 as Paida, and is thought to derive from the word paas, pae \\"limestone\\". Sights Paide castle at night Paide Church =Paide vallitorn= A castle was built in Paide by order of Konrad von Mandern, master of the Livonian Order, sometime in 1265 or 1266. It was from the beginning constructed around the central tower or keep, locally known as Tall Hermann tower or Vallitorn. With its six storeys, the tower has always been the core of the castle complex. The fortress was strengthened during the 14th and 15th centuries, when the surrounding walls were enlarged and towers added. It was also modernised to be able to meet the new threat of firearms. During the 16th century, the castle was again modified through the addition of outer bastions. During the Livonian War, the castle was repeatedly besieged by Russian troops, and in 1573 it was occupied by troops loyal to Ivan the Terrible. After that, the castle changed hands several times. It was also involved in the fighting during the 1600-1611 Polish-Swedish War, in the so-called Siege of Weissenstein. In 1895-1897 restoration work was carried out on the central tower and some other parts of the castle. However, in 1941, during World War II, retreating Soviet troops blew up the central tower and it was not repaired until after Estonia regained its independence, in 1990-1993. Today the restored central tower houses a part of J√§rva County museum. =Paide Church= Paide Church originally dates from the 16th century; however, it has been very badly damaged in both war and fire on several occasions, and the present-day building dates mainly from a reconstruction which took place in 1909-1910 under the supervision of architect J. C. M√ºhlhausen. Sports Paide is home to Paide linnastaadion, the home ground of Meistriliiga football team Paide Linnameeskond.

Common techniques include in-store advertising, online advertising, sampling, loyalty cards and coupons or vouchers. The planning and use of retail media is a key component in the delivery of shopper marketing campaigns. Retail media channels have become established as important for promoting goods and services at or near or even further beyond the points of purchase and consumption. Retail media is now being taken more seriously by most traditional media agencies. Retail media originated as media available within the retail environment. This has now developed into a media discipline in its own right as new retail media channels have been added. Retail media now reaches outside the retail environment to encompass media channels such loyalty program marketing, coupons and door drops, fleet media (retailer's fleet vehicles, etc.). Though many retail media channels are found inside the retailer's store/environment, the media channels themselves are not always \\"owned\\" or operated by retailers. Many retail media channels are operated independently by specialist media companies who also manage other media outside the retail environment. Context and targeting Retail media channels are to a large extent defined by the context of the retailer. The majority of retail media channels reach their audience at or near the point of purchase or point of choice. Research suggests media placed at or near the points of choice/purchase can have a significant impact on purchasing decisions (PoS).1 Media owners and agencies have learnt more in recent years about the value of retail media channels. There is potential for conflict of interest between the retailer selling the media and the CPG/FMCG buying the media, which is why retailers often engage a third-party media owner to operate and sell media space on their behalf. Challenges * Audience measures: There are several methods for evaluating the audience for retail media, whether total footfall, segmented audiences or sales uplift attributed to retail media channels. * Buying process: Dependent on the retailer, product, sales cycle and retail media channel, and other concerns, there are different media sales cycles to fit the particular requirements. Agencies Due to the specialized nature of retail media programs, advertisers are increasingly turning to dedicated retail media agencies to facilitate shopper-targeted campaigns. Retail media agencies help connect retailers such as Walmart and Sam's Club with brands that are interested in presenting their message to consumers while they are navigating the path to purchase. In the UK, one of the first agencies to specialise in this space was RMI (Retail Marketing International), who developed a \\"software operating system\\" known as BASE; a platform used by retailers and CPGs to run their shopper marketing. Other shopper marketing agencies in the UK include: GIG Retail, Result Marketing, and Capture Marketing. Traditional advertising agencies are beginning to understand the power of shopper marketing, in light of the overall share of traditional marketing budgets being directed more towards \\"shopper\\" and \\"digital\\" media, away from less efficient and less quantifiable media such as TV, local press, and radio. Networks Retail media networks are channels spanning individual retailers or a multitude of retailers. They can range from static posters, point-of-sale material, audio, visual or digital materials, and many things in between. Networks can therefore provide narrowcast and broadcast audience buying solutions. As shoppers spend time in stores, it becomes difficult for them to avoid in-store advertising and this can benefit advertisers, who not only can ensure their campaigns are seen, but that they can also be acted upon, especially if the advertised product is available in the store. Retail media networks now offer accountability in providing audience measurement techniques in the same way as traditional broadcast or print media.

The Damnonii (also referred to as Damnii) were a Brittonic people of the late 2nd century who lived in what became the Kingdom of Strathclyde by the Early Middle Ages, and is now southern Scotland. They are mentioned briefly in Ptolemy's Geography, where he uses both of the terms \\"Damnonii\\" and \\"Damnii\\" to describe them, and there is no other historical record of them, except arguably by Gildas three centuries later.De Excidio 28: inmundae leaenae damnoniae tyrannicus catulus constantinus \\"Constantine, the tyrannical whelp of the unclean lioness of Damnonia\\". Gildas' reference is sometimes taken as referring to the Dumnonii of southwestern Britain, but for a northwestern origin argument, see for example Lloyd Laing (1975) The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland c.400-1200 AD, London, p102 Their cultural and linguistic affinity is presumed to be Brythonic. However, there is no unbroken historical record, and a partly Pictish origin is not precluded. The Romans under Agricola had campaigned in the area in 81, and it was Roman-occupied (at least nominally) between the time that Hadrian's Wall was built (c. 122), through the building of the Antonine Wall (c. 142), until the pullback to Hadrian's Wall in 164. Ptolemy's Geography was written within this timeframe, so his account is contemporary.  Historiography  A medieval artist's rendition of Claudius Ptolemaeus. The sole record of the Damnonii and their towns is their mention by Ptolemy (c. 80 - c. 168). They are found in no other source. Ptolemy says that the towns of the Damnonii were Vanduara, Colania, Coria, Alauna, Lindum, and Victoria. However, there were no towns as such in the area at that time, so he was likely referring to Roman military camps and native strong points such as duns. Efforts have been made to determine the locations of the towns, but there is not enough information available to reach any degree of certainty, and the locations suggested are little more than guesswork. Reflecting the lack of evidence, there is little agreement on assigning modern locations to the towns. Among the assignments made by those whose work is considered to be authoritative (to varying degrees) are those of William Baxter (1719, Glossarium Antiquitatum Britannicum), William Camden (1607, Britannia), John Horsley (1732, Britannia Romana), William Forbes Skene (1880, Celtic Scotland, a History of Ancient Alban), George Chalmers (c. 1820, Caledonia), and William Roy (1793, Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain). Other historians either quote one of these as the authority for assigning locations to Ptolemy's towns, or simply assert a location in passing. A few offer lists of the assertions of the above authorities. Alauna is suggested to be the Camelon that is near and to the west of Falkirk, or at Stirling, or Kier (about NNW of Stirling, on the Allan Water), or the island of Inchkeith. Colania is suggested to be Lanark or Carstairs (about NE of Lanark), or some other place on the east side of Clydesdale. Coria is suggested to be Lynekirk (about WNW of Peebles, or some other place on the east side of Clydesdale. Lindum is suggested to be Kirkintilloch (about NE of Glasgow), or Linlithgow, or near Ardoch (the one about NNW of Stirling). Victoria is suggested to be Dalginross (about W of Crieff, or Abernethy (about SE of Perth). Vanduara is suggested to be Paisley or Renfrew (both about to the west of Glasgow), or some 20 miles south of Glasgow at Loudoun Hill. From 1757, initial studies of the Damnonii were heavily influenced by the literary forgery The Description of Britain (De Situ Britanniae). The work was considered the only authoritative record of Britannia Inferior, the northern part of Roman Britain. Throughout the latter part of the 18th century until it was debunked as a forgery in 1845, it purportedly contained a lost contemporary account of the province of Britannia from a Roman general, new details about Roman roads in Britain in the style of the Antonine Itinerary, and an improved version of Ptolemy's map. Its credibility was such, that even after it was proven to be fake, it was still cited as a historical source until the end of the 19th century. Even Chalmers and Roy believed in its authenticity at the time they wrote. De Situ Britanniae generally followed Ptolemy's map but made novel assertions regarding Damnonii towns.

Miksz√°th's early short stories were based on the lives of peasants and artisans and had little appeal at the time. However, they demonstrated his skill in crafting humorous anecdotes, which would be developed in his later, more popular works.

Miksz√°th was a member of the Liberal Party, and in 1887 was elected to the Diet of Hungary (one of the two top legislatures in Austria-Hungary).

The FANK was the successor of the Royal Khmer Armed Forces (, FARK) which had been responsible for the defense of the previous Kingdom of Cambodia since its independence in 1954 from France. General overview Being essentially a continuation of the old Royal armed forces under a new name, the FANK played a more partisan role in the Cambodian Civil War that escalated following the deposition as Head of State of Prince Norodom Sihanouk by a coup d‚Äô√©tat in March 1970 orchestrated by his own Prime- Minister General Lon Nol. Although the armed forces of the Kingdom had been involved since April 1967 in the suppression of the Communist Party of Kampuchea's rebellion led by Saloth Sar (better known as Pol Pot), up until Sihanouk's overthrow it was considered to have the consensual backing of the Cambodian society, as the Prince was considered the symbol of the people. History General Lon Nol, President of the Khmer Republic. On November 20, 1953, the French protectorate of Cambodia was granted full independence by France, allowing the young King Norodom Sihanouk to lead the government of the first post-colonial state in French-ruled Indochina. Under the terms of the Geneva Accords signed the following year which ended the Indochina War, French Army and Vietnamese Vietminh guerrilla units still operating in Cambodia were obliged to withdraw from its territory and that a new defense force was to be raised. Trained by the French and equipped by the United States since September 1950,Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 18. the armed forces of the new Kingdom of Cambodia (FARK) were formed mainly by Khmer regular soldiers recently transferred from French colonial units, though ex-Vietminh and former Khmer Issarak guerrillas of Khmer origin were also allowed to join. Most of the senior members of the Officer corps had been officials in the colonial regime. Lon Nol, for example, served as Commander of the Cambodian Police under the French protectorate. In 1955 Gen. Lon was promoted to Chief-of-Staff of the FARK, and in 1960 was appointed Minister of Defense. Meanwhile, Cambodia was admitted as a protocol state member of the US-sponsored SEATO alliance and under his command the FARK became a bastion of American influence on the Sihanouk regime, particularly because US military aid constituted 30% of the armed forces‚Äô budget until August 1964, when it was renounced by the Cambodian government. Following his faction's seizure of a large number of seats of the ruling Sangkum party's representation at the National Assembly in the 1966 general elections, Gen. Lon was elected Prime- Minister, thereby locking the state institutions under the firm grip of the military, just as Sihanouk had feared. However, he resigned from the post in 1967 after a car accident, only to return two years later when the monarch mounted a renewed purge against leftist dissidents. As a representative of the conservative Khmer who had supported the French rule, Lon Nol never accepted Sihanouk's neutralist policy of non-alignment. Though the Prince's sporadic purges of leftist movements would quench Lon's wrath at the growing communist insurgency, what truly worried him was Sihanouk's covert deals with North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, which allowed them to establish base-camps on the Cambodian side of the border with South Vietnam and built a massive supply infrastructure. Lon also knew that Sihanouk's balancing appeasement of the US from 1968 onwards by allowing B-52 aerial bombings and ‚Äòhot pursuit‚Äô cross- border raids against NVA/VC base areas within Cambodia would be ineffective in stopping the wider, home-grown insurgency. One of the measures he was able to undertake was the build-up of a strong anti-communist faction within the FARK's officer corps that would back him should Sihanouk shift again towards the left. =Alignment with the United States= On March 17, 1970, while Sihanouk was absent from the country on a state visit to China and the USSR, Lon Nol assumed power when the National Assembly in Phnom Penh unanimously voted the Prince out of office. Lon Nol automatically succeeded the latter as Head of State on August 18, and although he claimed that the move was constitutionally legal, it quickly ran afoul of the conservative mentality of the Cambodians, many of whom believed that the Prince ruled through divine favour. To further aggrieve matters, Prince Sihanouk, who had sought refuge in China after being deposed, established a political base in Beijing and entered into an alliance with the increasingly Maoist-oriented Khmer Rouge leadership and other leftist opposition groups. In April 1970 these disparate groups formed the FUNK, an umbrella organization dedicated to the armed overthrow of the pro-western Khmer Republic. Lon Nol also had to deal with a number of dissident FARK senior officers whom, though sharing most of his views, felt that the overthrow of Sihanouk had been one step too far. Many of these royalist officers resigned in protest from the armed forces' structure when Gen. Lon proceeded to transform with American help the old FARK into the FANK to accommodate the character of the new Republican regime. By contrast, new recruits were readily available from the ranks of the far-right Khmer Serei, a US-backed anti-communist guerrilla group led by the hardline Nationalist Son Ngoc Thanh which had fought against Sihanouk's regime during the 1960s and who always viewed him as a communist crony. The measures quickly implemented by Lon Nol's administration included the issue of ultimata demanding North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and Vietcong units to vacate the bases they had established on Khmer soil, and prevented arms shipments bound to the Vietcong from being unloaded at his sea ports. These same measures however, coupled by the effects of the joint US Army/Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Cambodian Incursion launched that same year against NVA/VC sanctuaries in Cambodia, resulted in a heavy backlash. In reality, the newly created Khmer Republic and its ill-prepared armed forces were soon caught off-guard in the early 1970s by the aggressive reaction of the NVA, which had previously limited its actions to providing support to Vietcong units operating at South Vietnam even after its devastating defeat in the January 1968 Tet Offensive. The outcome was that the period of Lon Nol's rule actually saw an increase of North Vietnamese military presence in the lower Mekong and Bassac corridors and in the north and northeast Cambodia, particularly from 1972 onwards. In response to the earlier FANK's failed ground offensives to expel them, strong NVA units launched in turn throughout 1971-72 ferocious counter-offensives on these areas ‚Äì using heavy artillery, tanks, and SA-7 Grail surface-to-air missiles for the first time in Cambodia ‚Äì, which dwarfed the Tet Offensive numerically. These massive-scale operations only served to exhaust both sides however, and led to the signing in January 1973 of the Paris Peace Accords which marked the official end of American direct involvement on combat operations in Vietnam. The Accords hit both the Khmer Republic and South Vietnam hard, as the military and financial aid that they received from the US was cut by over fifty percent (though American military personnel in Cambodia continued to coordinate the various military aid programs, sometimes finding themselves involved in prohibited advisory and combat tasks until 1975.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 10-12.) The FANK, which until that date had been armed, supplied, and maintained by American advisors and technicians, had to wake up to a new reality in which they had to repair their own equipment and train their troops as best as they could with far less of a budget. =Civil War years= The creation of the Chinese-sponsored FUNK coalition by Sihanouk and the lending of his popular support to the anti- Republican insurgency gave it greater legitimacy in the eyes of the pro- Sihanoukist Cambodian peasantry, many of whom began to flock into its ranks. This move inadvertently also allowed the Khmer Rouge to recruit peasants from the villages on the rural areas under their control that otherwise would have been uninterested. In addition, many politically moderate Cambodians came to dislike Lon Nol's authoritarian (and unstable) republican regime, due to his corrupt ways and oppressive rule that curbed political and civil rights far more than Sihanouk had done. In the wake of the January 1973 Paris Peace Accords, Lon Nol proved unable to halt the illegal build-up of North Vietnamese forces in the lower Mekong-Bassac area in preparation for a renewed offensive in neighbouring South Vietnam. He also failed to engage in a properly coordinated war effort with either the American CIA or the Southern Vietnamese Nguyen Van Thieu regime. Meanwhile, FANK troops committed numerous Human Rights abuses against civilians, particularly the persecution of ethnic Vietnamese (who were accused of supporting the NVA/VC) and the repression of Khmer peasant villagers who rioted in support of Sihanouk, misguided policies that drove the latter into the arms of Pol Pot. In the remote areas of the country, notably in the highland regions, the FANK proved incapable of restraining the Khmer Rouge's fearsome intimidation campaigns that targeted the peasantry, let alone protecting them. After mid-1971, the Republican government focused on consolidating its hold over the key urban centers, the main garrisons and the lower Mekong-Bassac corridors, thus leaving most of the countryside virtually open to Khmer Rouge recruiting drives.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 7. Whilst during the 1967‚Äì68 operations waged against the Khmer Rouge's Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea (RAK) strongholds in Battambang Province Lon Nol could rely on the peasantry's loyalty to Prince Sihanouk, he was now alone. His deteriorating army, reduced to a garrison force confined to the main cities, was increasingly regarded as the military wing of the Phnom Penh regime rather than of the nation itself. Facing them was the FUNK's armed wing, the Cambodian People's National Liberation Armed Forces (CPNLAF) which received arms and ammunition freely from the nation's porous borders. While the CPNLAF was far smaller, the FANK High Command was always faced with the problem of how to provide adequate equipment for the swelling number of volunteers who flocked to fight the NVA and the Khmer Rouge from their dwindling stocks. As the war progressed, weapons and ammunition, not to mention training grounds, became rarer, the FANK was unable to train in-country their new recruits, leaving it an army of raw conscripts and demoralized veterans. The FANK was already placed at a strategic disadvantage since May 1970, following the seizure of the northeastern areas of the country (the provinces of Stung Treng, Ratanakiri, Kratie, and Mondulkiri) by the NVA in response to the Lon Nol ultimatum and the loss to the Khmer Rouge of several peripheral eastern and southwestern Cambodian provinces (Kampot, Koh Kong, Kampong Cham, Preah Vihear, plus portions of Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey, Kampong Thom, Prey Veng, and Svay Rieng Provinces) during that same year. =Collapse= In January 1975, coinciding with the North Vietnamese winter offensive that shattered the South's defences apart, the Khmer Rouge closed in on Phnom Penh, already overcrowded with 250,000 civilian refugees, and besieged it. President Lon Nol, FANK Commander- in-Chief Gen. Sosthene Fernandez and other Khmer Republic officials could not coordinate an effective resistance and at the same time feed the refugees and residents of Phnom Penh. On April 1, Marshal Lon Nol resigned from the Presidency and left the Country by plane to Thailand, although most of the senior civilian and military government officials decided to stay. Later on April 17, the armed forces‚Äô Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Sak Sutsakhan was evacuated together with his family and relatives of other officials by helicopter to Kampong Thom, thus effectively ending the FANK's existence as a coherent fighting force.Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), pp. 168-170. The last stand of the army of the ill-fated Khmer Republic in any form took place around the Preah Vihear Temple in the D√¢ngr√™k Mountains, close to the Thai border. Remnants of the FANK's 9th Brigade Group occupied the area for a few weeks in late April 1975, following the collapse of the Lon Nol regime.Fenton, J. To the bitter end in Cambodia, New Statesman, 25-04-75. Even though their government had surrendered, FANK soldiers continued to fiercely hold their ground for nearly a month after the fall of Phnom Penh against several unsuccessful attempts by Khmer Rouge forces to reduce this last holdout. The Khmer Rouge finally succeeded on May 22, after shelling the hill where the temple stands, scaling it, and routing the defenders, as Thai officials reported at the time.United Press International, May 23, 1975. Command structure =Regional Commands= Prior to the War, Cambodia was divided into seven military districts termed 'Military Regions' (MR, ) encompassing one to ten military sub-districts () of unequal size roughly corresponding to the areas of the country's 23 provinces and districts. They were organized since September 1969 as follows: *First Military Region () ‚Äì headquartered at Kampong Cham, capital of Kampong Cham Province, the MR 1 covered the Kampong Cham, Prey Veng, and Svay Rieng military sub-districts. *Second Military Region () ‚Äì headquartered at Kampong Speu, capital of Kompong Speu Province, the MR 2 covered the Kampong Speu, Kampot, Tak√©o, Srakar Neak, Kampong Seila, Thmar Keo, Kirirom, Kep-Bokor, and Koh Kong military sub-districts. *Third Military Region () ‚Äì headquartered at Battambang, capital of Battambang Province, the MR 3 covered the Battambang, Pursat, Thmar Pouk, Stung Meanchey, and Kampong Chhnang military sub- districts. *Fourth Military Region () ‚Äì headquartered at Siem Reap, capital of Siem Reap Province, the MR 4 covered the Siem Reap, Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey, and Angkor Chum military sub-districts. *Fifth Military Region () ‚Äì headquartered at Stung Treng, capital of Stung Treng Province, the MR 5 covered the Stung Treng and Ratanakiri military sub- districts. *Sixth Military Region () ‚Äì headquartered at Krati√©, capital of Krati√© Province, the MR 6 covered the Kratie and Mondulkiri military sub- districts. *Phnom Penh Special Military Zone (PPSMZ, ) ‚Äì headquartered at Phnom Penh, it covered the National Capital zone and its environs, the Udong Meanchey and Kandal military sub-districts. The 6th MR and its regional HQ at Kratie were lost permanently upon the desertion of the local Cambodian garrison troops to the enemy soon after the beginning of hostilities.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 33. A special military zone for the lower Mekong River, designated the Special Mekong Zone ‚Äì SMZ or 12th Tactical Zone (French: Zone Sp√©ciale du Mekong ‚Äì ZSM; Zone Tactique 12) was established in mid-1971 at Kandal Province, situated between the Cambodian Capital and the South Vietnamese border.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces 1970-1975 (2011), p. 19. Two additional military regions (8th MR and 9th MR) were created in 1973.Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), pp. 48-49. Branches The FANK's predecessor was first established on November 9, 1953 under the terms of a French-Khmer convention and initially received the designation of Cambodian National Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es Nationales Cambodgiennes ‚Äì FANC), changed in 1955 to Royal Khmer Armed Forces ( ‚Äì FARK). By the late 1950s, the FARK consisted of ground, air and naval branches of service, respectively the Royal Khmer Army (French: Arm√©e Royale Khm√®re ‚Äì ARK), the Royal Khmer Aviation (French: Aviation Royale Khm√®re ‚Äì AVRK), and the Royal Khmer Navy (French: Marine Royale Khm√®re ‚Äì MRK). Their roles were defined as follows: to guarantee the sovereignty of the nation and that of the King; to ensure internal security by maintaining the social order and the rule of law; and to defend the newly independent Kingdom of Cambodia from external threats. Upon Lon Nol's coup in March 1970, the Cambodian military establishment was renamed FANK, thus becoming the official armed forces of the new regime, the Khmer Republic. The roles defined for the reorganized FANK were essentially the same as before, except that now they had to defend the sovereignty of the Republican Government and not of the deposed Prince, and drive out all the NVA/VC forces from eastern Cambodia. The FANK comprised the following branches: * Khmer National Army (, ANK) * Khmer Air Force (, AAK) * Khmer National Navy (, MNK) Elite Forces *Cambodian Airborne Brigade *Cambodian Para-Commando Battalion *Khmer Special Forces *Lake Brigade *Cambodian Marine Corps (French: Corps de Fusiliers-Marins Khm√®res) *Cambodian Navy SEALs Training Facilities The Air Force Academy was transferred from Pochentong to the provincial capital of Battambang whilst the Officer Candidate School was moved from Phnom Penh to Longvek in Kampong Chhnang Province, just north of Oudong. New infantry training centres were built at Kandal, Kampong Speu, Ream, Sisophon, and Longvek whilst an additional Recondo School run by the Khmer Special Forces was opened near Battambang in November 1972 to train Long-range reconnaissance patrol (LRRP) teams.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 15-17; 46. To train Khmer National Navy officer cadets, a Naval Academy () was established at Chrui Chhangwar Naval Base in late 1971, and an Enlisted Man Training Center (), which provided specialized courses for junior ranks was set up one Kilometer south of the Cambodian Capital.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970‚Äì1975 (2011), p. 240. An Air-Ground Operations School ‚Äì AGOS (French: √âcole des op√©rations air-sol ‚Äì EOAS) was opened in May 1973 by the Khmer Air Force to train forward air guides (FAGs) for the Army.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 20.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 220. =Foreign assistance= Soon after its creation in 1970, the Khmer Republic requested and received military assistance from the United States, South Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, the Republic of China (Taiwan), Australia and New Zealand. To upgrade FANK capabilities, a regimented training programme began in early 1971 in South Vietnam under American auspices. Between February 1971 and November 1972, training centers run by the US Army- Vietnam Individual Training Program (UITG) were set up at the former MIKE Force base camps of Long H·∫£i, Phuc Tuy, and Chi Lang to re-train Cambodian Army, KAF airfield security and MNK Naval Infantry troops in basic light infantry, armour, artillery, and marine tactics.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 255.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 10-11. More specialized training was also provided to selected FANK personnel. Paratroops' tactical courses were held at the Australian-operated Van Kiep LRRP Training Center,Rottman and Volstad, Vietnam Airborne (1990), p. 27. and at the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Airborne Training Centers of Long Thanh and Tan Son Nhut Air Base, near Saigon; some 60 Cambodian students were later sent to Indonesia to attend the Para-Commando course at the Batujajar Airborne Commando School, near Bandung in West Java.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 15. Special Forces' (SF) courses were undertaken at the LLDB Training Center at Dong Ba Thin Base Camp near Cam Ranh Bay, South Vietnam, but also in Thailand, at the Royal Thai Army (RTA) Special Warfare Center at Fort Narai, Lopburi province, while Guerrilla and 'Commando' techniques were taught by the Royal Thai Police (RTP) Police Aerial Resupply Unit (PARU) at their Phitsanulok and Hua Hin training camps.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), pp. 48-50. Ranger/LRRP courses were conducted at the American-operated Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) Recondo School at Nha Trang, South Vietnam, and at the RTA Recondo School co-located at Ft. Narai, Thailand. Additional SF and SEAL training was undertaken respectively at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in San Diego, California in the United States, and at Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 258. Chinese instructor pilots from Taiwan were posted on loan at the KAF Battambang Air Academy to train its pilots whereas Khmer cadets and air crews were sent for L-19, 0-1, UH-1, T-28, AC-47, EC-47, AU-24, and C-123 training to South Vietnam, Thailand, and the United States. Most of the advanced courses and specialized training of Khmer combat pilots was conducted by Thai instructors at the RTAF Kampheng Sen Flight Training School in Nakhon Pathom Province and by American advisors of Detachment 1, 56th Special Operations Wing at Udorn, U-Tapao and Takhli airbases in Thailand, while others were dispatched to attend observer courses at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam. A small number also went to train with the US Navy at the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida and attended courses at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) East Sale Airbase in Victoria, Australia. An input of fourteen Cambodian naval officers were sent to the United States to attend advanced courses at various US naval training institutions. Some eight students attended the US Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland, whilst two senior officers went to the Naval War College (NWC) in Newport, Rhode Island and the Navy Supply Corps School (NSCS) in Athens, Georgia; four other students attended the small boat tactics school at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard (MINSY) and the adjacent Naval Inshore Operations Center at Vallejo, California.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 241.

A bowhead whale, which is most often used in muktuk Muktuk is most often made from the skin and blubber of the bowhead whale, although the beluga and the narwhal are also used. Usually eaten raw, today it is occasionally finely diced, breaded, deep fried, and then served with soy sauce. Despite it being usually eaten raw it could also be eaten frozen or cooked.

It was used as an antiscorbutic by British Arctic explorers. Blubber is also a source of vitamin D. As whales grow, mercury accumulates in the liver, kidney, muscle, and blubber, and cadmium settles in the blubber. It also contains PCBs, carcinogens that damage human nervous, immune and reproductive systems, bioaccumulated from the marine food web, and a variety of other contaminants.

From 1969 to 1992, it played a major role in disciplining youth party activists and building up their character with Marxist-Leninist ideas. UJSC members were generally seen as the future leaders of their country. Benefits of membership in the UJSC included government- sponsored scholarships, and a guaranteed position in the civil service upon completion of higher education studies. Since the PCT at that time was essentially socialist, a vast majority of UJSC members studied at universities in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Cuba. The UJSC lost prominence after the PCT lost power in the events of 1991-1992\\\\. Several officials in the current administration of the Republic of the Congo were members of the UJSC.

In four years, 31 issues were printed in cities as Cairo, Geneva, London and Folkestone. It was an opposition newspaper published in exile (outside the Ottoman Empire) and supported by the Committee of Union and Progress. Its first issues were published solely in Kurmanji, but from the 4th issue some texts in Turkish were also published. The newspaper was distributed for free. From its 6th issue the newspaper was published in Geneva, and edited by Abdurrahman Bedir Khan, Mikdads brother who had close ties to Abdullah Cevdet and ƒ∞shak S√ºkuti, both editors of the Osmanli and founders of co-founders of Committee of Union and Progress. The newspaper published several articles that were critical to the government of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. It got banned in the Ottoman Empire and had to be smuggled in. According to the letters to the editor it had readers in cities as Adana, Damascus, Mardin and Diyarbakƒ±r. It published articles concerning Kurdish History and literature and the opposition to Abdul Hamid II. One of its first issues included a call in Turkish language to Abdul Hamid for that its distribution shall be allowed in the Kurdish provinces arguing that the illiteracy of the Kurds was a reason for the backwardness of the Kurds but as well for the foreign powers to intervene in the region. In 1918, the newspaper was published by the son of Emin Ali Bedirkhan, S√ºreyya Bedir Khan. In 1991 scholar Emin Bozarslan republished and translated into Modern Turkish a collection of its issues.

It is one of seven high schools within the North Clackamas School District. The school's mascot is the mustang, and its colors are maroon and gold.  History  Milwaukie High School dates back to 1907. Originally constructed in 1925, the oldest portion of the three-story building that houses the school today is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Milwaukie. The school's first mascot, the Maroon, fell into disfavor with students because of its similarity to the word \\"moron.\\" The student body voted on a new mascot and as a result the mustang was chosen. In 2005, the school added the Milwaukie Academy of the Arts to its campus. This charter school operates in conjunction with Milwaukie High School's main campus to offer a full course catalog. The school focuses on integrating the arts into core school subject areas. Reconstruction In 2008, the JC Lillie Center for the Arts, the school's performing arts center, underwent a major esthetic and structural renovation, which included a redeveloped entrance and courtyard, remodeled auditorium, and a notoriously faulty sound system. In June 2018, the main campus of the school was demolished to make space for a new academic building. Construction of the new structure started in early September 2018, and is scheduled for completion in August 2021. The new facility will address many the previous structure's issues, including overcrowding, and safety concerns. The new facility was designed by the IBI Group and BRIC Architecture and is being constructed by Skanska. Until the campus redevelopment concludes, students will practice academics in modular structures located on the school's football field, which will be renovated once the academic building reopens and the structures are removed. The school unofficially named the temporary academic structures \\"Mod City\\". Living History Day Since 1996, Milwaukie High School has annually hosted the nationally recognized Living History Day. On this day thousands of veterans are welcomed into the school to help educate students about past wars, and provide first-hand accounts of military experiences. Unfortunately, this was cut in 2010 to lack of funding and staffing reductions. Academics In 2014, out of 260 seniors, 220 graduated, for an 83% graduation rate. Athletics Milwaukie High School has competed in the Northwest Oregon Conference at the 5A classification since 2010.

High Park Forest School is a former special school in High Park, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was a school founded to provide a boost to children who were tubercular or had other physical detriments. Today, it is an outdoor environmental education facility run by a local non-profit organization called the High Park Nature Centre. It is located in High Park west of downtown, on Colborne Lodge Road. History High Park Forest School was opened in the 1910s (there are sources that point to 1912, 1914 and 1915). It was initially a place for children with tuberculosis but through the years it became a summer school for underprivileged and/or undernourished children. For the school‚Äôs first 18 years in operation, it occupied three outdoor tents, a permanent building was constructed only in 1932. The forest schools ceased existence as a school for poor and/or undernourished children in 1963. In 1970, the area around the school was the site of an International Sculpture Symposium. Several sculptures are still in place around the school. Others have been moved to other locations. After the 1960s, the building was used by various organizations and was vacated in 2013. In 2015, High Park Nature Centre moved into the building. Curricula Mr. Brown's class at Forestry School in 1917 Poor and/or undernourished children from Toronto's public schools attended the school from May 1 to October 31 to augment their education and also get good nutritious foods and exercise to help them become healthy. Children attended the school Monday through Saturday (half days on Saturdays). On Saturdays, if the weather was good the children were all bussed to Sunnyside Swimming Pool where they were entitled to free admission and free swimming (no classes). Mondays through Fridays children would attend at outdoor classrooms and in the mornings they were brought snacks of whole wheat bread and butter and hot chocolate in the cooler months and milk in the warmer months. At lunch time, the children would line up and go into the main building, entering through the main right hand door in the picture where whey were seated according to age. They were served a hot nutritious meal, milk and a cod liver oil pill every day. After lunch, the children would line up once again inside the building, pick up their bed rolls which consisted of a pillow, a sheet and an army-type blanket. There were cots set up near each classroom and the children would take their bedrolls to the cots for an afternoon nap of two hours. When they awoke from their naps, they returned their bedrolls to the room inside where they were stored, then lined up to wash hands and faces and brush their teeth. This was followed by an hour of playtime.....baseball, dodge ball and many other sporting activities. After play time, the children returned to their classrooms for more education and then were served the whole wheat bread and hot chocolate or milk again. When 4 o'clock came...the teachers would escort each child up to Bloor Street and made sure each child got on the street cars for their journey home. The objective was to provide underprivileged and/or undernourished children who ordinarily would have spent their summer days on the streets of Toronto a place to go for good food, good activities, good health and education. All the things the Toronto Board of Education felt poor and/or undernourished children would miss out on without this program.

He is six feet 5 inches tall. He is the son of cricket writer and journalist Christopher Martin-Jenkins, and as such has been nicknamed RMJ (a reference to his father CMJ).  Early life  Martin-Jenkins was educated at Radley College and was in the same college house at the same time as cricketers Andrew Strauss and Ben Hutton. These three were among other successes in the first batch of 1997 at Durham University's Centre of Excellence for Cricket, which was led by former test batsman Graeme Fowler. Strauss said that he was helped by Hutton and Martin-Jenkins, as he \\"gained confidence from the fact that I was not the only person who was prepared to take the risk of jumping off the City-bound conveyer belt.\\"  Cricket career  Martin-Jenkins played his entire first-class career for Sussex, except for 1 first-class match for British Universities in 1996. He scored his maiden first-class century in 2001, and in 2002, he and Mark Davis scored a record eighth-wicket partnership for Sussex of 291, and Martin-Jenkins also hit his career best score of 205*. As of 2015, this is still the highest eighth-wicket partnership for Sussex. He was a prominent member of both the 2003, 2006 and 2007 County Championship winning teams; in 2011, Steve James writing in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described Martin-Jenkins and James Kirtley (who also retired in 2010) as \\"consistent and reliable performers who are role models and guardians of a team ethos that can endure.\\" He described Martin- Jenkins as \\"the most solid of all-rounders\\".  Retirement and post-retirement  In July 2010, Martin-Jenkins announced his retirement at Hove on 19 July 2010, in order to become a teacher. In his final season, he averaged 62.90 with the bat, and took 30 wickets at an average of under 20 runs per wicket. He taught at Hurstpierpoint College, and in 2014 he moved to Harrow School, where he teaches Geography and is Master in Charge of Cricket. In 2015, St Bede's School opened a new stand in memory of Christopher Martin-Jenkins, and Robin Martin-Jenkins rang the bell to signal the start of play.

It adjoins the suburbs of South Heighton and Mount Pleasant and backs onto the South Downs The Manor of Denton was held in Saxon times by Earl Godwin, Father of King Harold II Godwinson. It seems likely that Denton was destroyed during the Saxon rebellion of 1068. It does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name Denton comes from Old English and means farmstead or village in a valley. Amenities Denton's church, St. Leonard's, was first built around 1288, later extended and carefully restored during the Decorated Period. The walls are of flint and stone and the Vestry was added during the 20th Century. The remains of what is thought to have been a priest's house in the west end of the churchyard, dating from about 1280, have recently been partly restored. The village has a junior school and one pub, the \\"Flying Fish\\" (originally named the \\"Kicking Donkey\\") which dates back to the 18th Century. Denton Island There is also a man-made island called Denton Island, in the middle of Newhaven Harbour, which featured a Toll Bridge which the residents of Denton village were exempt from paying.

Offering a full-time program, the school is based on experiential learning. Students analyze business case studies and participate in simulations, such as building real assembly lines and selling products door to door. Acton originally offered a MBA program, which was replaced by its own Next Great Adventure (NGA) program. The school was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs through Hardin-Simmons University. It is currently unaccredited.  History  Acton grew out of the curriculum developed by the Acton Foundation for Entrepreneurial Excellence (AFEE). Founded by Jeff Sandefer, an entrepreneur and teacher at the University of Texas, AFEE was created to publish entrepreneurship cases and notes and spread entrepreneurship curriculum to schools across the United States. While at UT, Sandefer was ranked one of the top ten entrepreneurship professors in the country by BusinessWeek. In 2002, Sandefer and fellow teachers Phil Siegel, Vaughn Brock and Jack Long left the University of Texas over a dispute about the future of the program. After their final class attracted 130 students, they decided to use the curriculum to launch a free-standing business school and founded the Acton School of Business. Acton graduated its first class in 2004. The school derives its name from Lord Acton, a 19th-century scholar and originator of the famous quote \\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" In October, 2018, due to a loss of funding, Hardin- Simmons University, ended a number of programs. This included closure of its Acton MBA Program campus extension, ending Acton's accreditation. Acton is currently unaccredited, and offers its own Next Great Adventure (NGA) program to replace its MBA degree.  Campus  The Acton campus is located on the shores of Lady Bird Lake, in Austin, Texas. Curriculum Using case reviews, Socratic discussions , exercises and business simulations, Acton offers its NGA entrepreneurship program in under a year. Unlike traditional MBA programs, Acton offers only a core curriculum with no additional elective courses. The program's curriculum is divided into three sections, Integrative Courses, Tools Courses and Life of Meaning. Admissions  The average undergraduate GPA of an admitted student is 3.3, the average age is 30 (median is 29), and the average GMAT score is 637. Most students have about four to six years of work experience on enrollment. Tuition  The cost of tuition (totaling $65,000 in 2019) includes all fees and course materials. Not included in tuition costs are housing, utilities, food, personal insurance, or computers.

After she retired from competitive sport she became a sports schoolteacher. Track career =Records= She once held simultaneously five Israeli national records. One of them is still a record and two others held for over 20 years. *Her time of 11.45s in the 100m, set at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, was broken on Sat Apr 19, 2014, by Olga Lansky. Lansky's result though was vacated later the same year due to skipping mandatory drug test after the competition. *Her time of 12.93s in the 100m hurdles, set in Berlin shortly after the 1976 Summer Olympics, stood as a national record for 26 years, until it was broken by Irina Lenskiy in 2002. *Her time of 23.57s in the 200m, set in Stuttgart in 1975, held as a record for 29 years, until it was broken, also by Lenskiy, in 2002. *Her mark of 6.14m in the long jump was a national record from 1971 to 1984. *Her record of 4837 points in the Women's pentathlon was a national record from 1971 until the format was changed in 1977. =Asian Games= Roth won five gold medals and one silver medal in two Asian Games.

The building was formerly the Sheffield area headquarters of British Rail. History The building was situated on the former Pond Street Goods station, closed on 7 October 1961. Land was cleared during 1963 to make way for the new offices. Sheaf House was built with a reinforced concrete frame, finished with modern (at the time) metal and glass cladding. The building was opened in 1965 and housed 500 staff who had been transferred from the Midland Railway old offices in Norfolk House, Line control offices at Rotherham Westgate and Victoria were also closed and transferred to Sheaf House, becoming British Rail's Sheffield Division headquarters. The building was demolished in late 2005 to make way for the redevelopment of Sheaf Square. This action featured on Channel 4's Demolition television programme. Proposed schemes There had previously been several proposals for refurbishing the building, including transforming it into a 180 bedroom hotel. The latest proposal along with the adjacent Dyson House site is for a futuristic mixed use scheme designed by Make Architects (Ken Shuttleworth) designer of the Swiss Re (Gerkin) in London.Skyscraper News The scheme is partial funded by EU regeneration grants and Yorkshire Forward as part of the Heart of the City projects masterplan to regenerate the area.

The 1,2-rearrangement takes place under acidic conditions. The name of the rearrangement reaction comes from the rearrangement of pinacol to pinacolone. :Pinacol rearrangement This reaction was first described by Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig in 1860 of the famed Fittig reaction involving coupling of 2 aryl halides in presence of sodium metal in dry ethereal solution. Mechanism In the course of this organic reaction, protonation of one of the ‚ÄìOH groups occurs and a carbocation is formed. If both the ‚ÄìOH groups are not alike, then the one which yields a more stable carbocation participates in the reaction. Subsequently, an alkyl group from the adjacent carbon migrates to the carbocation center. The driving force for this rearrangement step is believed to be the relative stability of the resultant oxonium ion, which has complete octet configuration at all centers (as opposed to the preceding carbocation). The migration of alkyl groups in this reaction occurs in accordance with their usual migratory aptitude, i.e.hydride > phenyl carbanion > tertiary carbanion (if formed by migration) > secondary carbanion (if formed by migration) > methyl carbanion . {Why Carbanion? Because every migratory group leaves by taking electron pair with it.} The conclusion is that the group which stabilizes the carbocation more effectively is migrated. Stereochemistry of the rearrangement In cyclic systems, the reaction presents more features of interest. In these reactions, the stereochemistry of the diol plays a crucial role in deciding the major product. An alkyl group which is situated trans- to the leaving ‚ÄìOH group alone may migrate. If otherwise, ring expansion occurs, i.e. the ring carbon itself migrates to the carbocation centre. This reveals another interesting feature of the reaction, viz. that it is largely concerted. There appears to be a connection between the migration origin and migration terminus throughout the reaction. Moreover, if the migrating alkyl group has a chiral center as its key atom, the configuration at this center is retained even after migration takes place. History Although Fittig first published about the pinacol rearrangement, it was not Fittig but Aleksandr Butlerov who correctly identified the reaction products involved. In an 1859 publication Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig described the reaction of acetone with potassium metal. Fittig wrongly assumed a molecular formula of (C3H3O)n for acetone, the result of a long-standing atomic weight debate finally settled at the Karlsruhe Congress in 1860. He also wrongly believed acetone to be an alcohol which he hoped to prove by forming a metal alkoxide salt. The reaction product he obtained instead he called paraceton which he believed to be an acetone dimer. In his second publication in 1860 he reacted paraceton with sulfuric acid (the actual pinacol rearrangement). :Pinacol rearrangement Again Fittig was unable to assign a molecular structure to the reaction product which he assumed to be another isomer or a polymer. Contemporary chemists who had already adapted to the new atomic weight reality did not fare better. One of them, Charles Friedel, believed the reaction product to be the epoxide tetramethylethylene oxide in analogy with reactions of ethylene glycol. Finally Butlerov in 1873 came up with the correct structures after he independently synthesised the compound trimethylacetic acid (Pivalic) which Friedel had obtained earlier by oxidizing with a dichromate. Some of the problems during the determination of the structure are because carbon skeletal rearrangements were unknown at that time and therefore the new concept had to be found. Butlerov theory allowed the structure of carbon atoms in the molecule to rearrange and with this concept a structure for pinacolone could be found.

Valka and the Estonian town Valga are twins, separated by the Estonian/Latvian border but using the slogan \\"One Town, Two Countries\\". The border dividing the Livonian town of Walk was marked out in 1920 by an international jury headed by British Colonel Stephen George Tallents. With the expansion of the Schengen Agreement and abolition of the Estonian/Latvian border in 2007, it was announced that common public bus transport would be established between Valka and Valga. Also, all border crossing-points were removed and roads and fences opened. In 2016 it was announced that due to better welfare and higher salaries in Estonia, many Valka inhabitants have registered themselves as inhabitants of Valga.DesmitƒÅ daƒºa Valkas novada iedzƒ´votƒÅju reƒ£istrƒìju≈°ies IgaunijƒÅ, vƒìsta raidƒ´jums History The town of Walk (in German) was first mentioned in 1286 and from 1419 was the seat of the Landtag of the Livonian Confederation. City rights were granted by the Polish-Lithuanian king Stefan Batory in 1584. However, the town gained its importance only at the end of the 19th century when the Vidzeme teacher's seminary was operating here, and the important railway junction was developed. Furthermore, the first narrow-gauge railway line in the territory of modern Latvia was stretched from Valka to Estonian city of P√§rnu. On November 15, 1917 the decision to proclaim the independent Republic of Latvia was made in Valka. The red-white-red flag of Latvia was raised here for the first time.

Early life Macleay was born at Wick, Caithness, Scotland, second son of Kenneth Macleay of Keiss and his wife Barbara, n√©e Horne. Macleay was educated at the Edinburgh Academy 1834‚Äì36 and then to studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh; but when he was 18 years old his widowed mother died, and he decided to go to Australia with his cousin, William Sharp MacLeay. They arrived at Sydney in March 1839 on HMS Royal George. William Macleay took up land at first near Goulburn, and afterwards on the Murrumbidgee River. He is noted as the last of the naturalists in a family that active in this field, his uncle was the colonial secretary Alexander Macleay, a member and fellow of societies concerned with the flora and fauna of the empire's colonies. Political career On 1 March 1855 Macleay was elected to the old Legislative Council as member for the Lachlan and Lower Darling Pastoral District. After responsible government, on 19 April 1856 Macleay was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Lachlan and Lower Darling serving until 11 April 1859. From 1860‚Äì1874 he represented Murrumbidgee in the Assembly. Zoological career Macleay lived in Sydney from 1857, the year he was married to Susan Emmeline Deas-Thomson, and was now able to develop his interest in science. He had made a small collection of insects, and in 1861 began to extend it considerably. In April 1862 a meeting was held at his house and it was decided to found a local Entomological Society. Macleay was elected president and held the position for two years. The society lasted 11 years and, not only was Macleay the author of the largest number of papers, he also bore most of the expense. He had succeeded to the Macleay collection on the death of W. S. Macleay in 1865, and in 1874 decided to extend it from an entomological collection into a zoological collection. Also in 1874 the Linnean Society of New South Wales was founded, of which Macleay was elected the first president, and in May 1875, having fitted up the barque Chevert, he sailed for New Guinea, where he obtained what he described as \\"a vast and valuable collection\\" of zoological specimens. After his return from New Guinea, Macleay fostered the Linnean Society. He presented many books and materials for scientific work to it, however all were destroyed when the Garden Palace was burnt down in September 1882. In spite of this blow the society continued on its way and gradually built up another library. In 1885 Macleay erected a building for the use of the society in Ithaca road, Elizabeth Bay, and endowed it with the sum of ¬£14,000. He had contributed several papers to the Proceedings of the society, and in 1881 his two-volume Descriptive Catalogue of Australian Fishes was published. Three years later a Supplement to this catalogue appeared, and in the same year his Census of Australian Snakes was reprinted from the Proceedings. Macleay had hoped to make a descriptive catalogue of the Dipterous insects of Australia, but his health began to fail and it was not completed. Legacy Macleay realized that a lot could be done to prevent diseases like typhoid fever and strongly urged the appointment of a government bacteriologist. Receiving little support he eventually left ¬£12,000 to the University of Sydney for the foundation of a chair or lectureship in bacteriology, but this was rejected by the university senate due to the conditions of the bequest and the money went to the Linnean Society. Nearly 40 years later a professorship in bacteriology was established from the Bosch fund. In 1890 the government having provided a building in the university grounds he handed the valuable Macleay collection to the university, together with an endowment of ¬£6000 to provide for the salary of a curator. Macleay was knighted in 1889. He died on 7 December 1891; his wife, Susan, died in 1903 and there were no children. Macleay left ¬£6000 to the Linnean Society for general purposes and after his wife died, ¬£35,000 was given to the Linnean Society to provide four Linnean Macleay fellowships of ¬£400 per annum each, to encourage and advance research in natural science.

Varq√° was referred to by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as a Hand of the Cause of God and was identified as one of the nineteen Apostles of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Bah√° ºu'll√°h wrote a tablet addressed to Varq√°, praising the high station of the King and Beloved of Martyrs.  Execution  Varq√° is well known as the father of R√∫hu'll√°h. The two of them were the first among a large group to be martyred in 1896 by Persian authorities for being Bah√° º√≠s. This story is summarized from Balyuzi's book. R√∫hu'll√°h, son of Varq√°. The executioner, Hajibu'd Dawlih, was particularly enraged with his prisoners, and brought out Varq√° and R√∫hu'll√°h into an inner room. Varq√°'s calm reply to questioning further maddened his captors. The executioner plunged a dagger into the chest of Varq√° saying 'How are you?' to which Varq√° replied 'Feeling better than you'. Hajibu'd Dawlih then asked him which should die first, him or his son R√∫hu'll√°h, to which Varq√° replied 'It is the same to me.' Hajibu'd Dawlih and four others then began to tear Varq√° apart in front of his son. He made an offer to R√∫hu'll√°h that he could be adopted, offered an allowance, given a post in the government, but R√∫hu'll√°h asked to join his father instead. Hajibu'd Dawlih then strangled him with a bastinado. After his dead body fell to the ground, R√∫hu'll√°h's body raised and then fell to the ground again, a yard away. The experience scared Hajibu'd Dawlih so much that he ran away screaming.  Family  The son of Varq√°, Val√≠yu'll√°h Varq√°, later was appointed a Hand of the Cause by Shoghi Effendi in 1951. When the latter died in 1955, the grandson of Varq√°,  ªAl√≠-Muhammad Varq√° was appointed in his place.

The village has a Serb ethnic majority (69.81%) with a present Romani (13.58%) and Hungarian minority (9.38%). It has a population of 1,620 people (2002 census). Name In Serbian, the village is known as –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ –ö—Ä—Å—Ç—É—Ä / Srpski Krstur (also simply –ö—Ä—Å—Ç—É—Ä / Krstur), in Croatian as Srpski Krstur, and in Hungarian as √ìkereszt√∫r. Its name means \\"the Serb Krstur\\" (There is also a village of Ruski Krstur in Vojvodina, meaning \\"the Rusyn Krstur\\"). The Serbian name of the village derived from Serbian word krst (\\"cross\\" in English), while Hungarian name derived from Hungarian word kereszt (meaning \\"cross\\" in English too). The Hungarian word kereszt itself is of Slavic origin - variants of this word in some other Slavic languages are including Bulgarian \\"–ö—Ä—ä—Å—Ç\\" (\\"krst\\"), Russian \\"–ö—Ä–µ—Å—Ç\\" (\\"krest\\"), Ukrainian \\"–•—Ä–µ—Å—Ç\\" (\\"hrest\\"), etc. History Bronze Age graves of south Russian steppe nomads were found in nearby ƒêala. The village was mentioned first in 1390. According to some claims, it was mentioned in the 15th century under name Papkereszt√∫r. In the 14th-15th century, the village was part of the Csanadiensis County within the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. In 1526-1527 it was part of the Serb state of Emperor Jovan Nenad, and was subsequently included into the Ottoman Empire. During the Ottoman administration, the village was part of the Teme≈üvar Eyalet. In the middle of the 17th century, the village was uninhabited. It was repopulated in the 18th century, during the Habsburg administration. In 1717, population of the village numbered 4 houses. In 1752, the village was populated by Serbs, who came from the abolished parts of the Military Frontier in Pomori≈°je and the population of the village increased; in 1787 its population numbered 719, and in 1850 1,793 inhabitants. From 1718 to 1778, the village was part of a separate Habsburg province known as the Banat of Temeswar. After abolishment of this province, in 1778, the village was included into Torontal County, which was administratively a part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. The village was also a part of the autonomous District of Velika Kikinda within the Torontal County from 1774 to 1876. In 1848-1849, the village was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina and in 1849-1860 part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Habsburg crown land. It was part of the Batschka- Torontal District (1849-1850) and Gro√übetschkerek District (1850-1860) within the voivodeship. After the abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, the village was again included into Torontal County. In 1910 census, majority of village inhabitants spoke the Serbian language.http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/3899/vojvodina1910.png In 1918, the village firstly became part of the Banat Republic, then (as part of the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja region) part of the Kingdom of Serbia, and finally part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). In 1918-1919, the village was part of the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja region and also (from 1918 to 1922) part of the Veliki Beƒçkerek district. From 1922 to 1929, the village was part of the Belgrade Oblast and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, the village was part of German-occupied Serbia and was included into the autonomous region of Banat, which was governed by its German minority. Since 1944, the village is part of autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina, which (from 1945) was part of new socialist Serbia within Yugoslavia.

A right-handed batsman and left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he has played for the Malaysia national cricket team since 1999, and county cricket in England for Somerset. He is the youngest player to play for Malaysia, and has played for England at Under-14, Under-15, Under-16 and Under-18 level. He has also represented England Under-16s at hockey, and played badminton for his school. His elder brother Rohan also plays for Malaysia. Biography =Early career= Born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Arul Suppiah moved to England to attend Millfield School and further his cricket career. He played for the school's cricket team between 1998 and 2001. He made his debut for Malaysia in August 1999 at the age of 15, becoming the youngest player to play for Malaysia. In the Saudara Cup match against Singapore, he took a hat-trick, the only time this has happened in the 37-year history of the fixture. He next played for Malaysia in the 2000 ACC Trophy and in the 2001 Saudara Cup match, but commitments in England began to reduce his availability for Malaysia. He had made his debut for Somerset Second XI in 2000, and played for the first team for the first time in 2002, when he played against West Indies A, making his first-class debut. He played a County Championship match against Lancashire later in the year. He had also made his List A debut in 2002, playing for the Somerset Cricket Board against Cornwall in the C&G; Trophy in August. In September he played four Norwich Union League matches for Somerset. He was not yet a regular member of the Somerset first team and was regularly playing for their Second XI in addition to playing Minor Counties cricket for Devon. He played four C&G; Trophy matches for Devon between 2003 and 2005. =Later career= India. In the second half of the 2005 season he was one of a selection of young players offered regular first team cricket by Somerset. He scored his first first-class century against Derbyshire that year. He played eight totesport League matches for Somerset in 2005, and also represented them in that year's Twenty20 Cup, which was won by Somerset. He also played for them in an International 20:20 Club Championship tournament that September, playing against Faisalabad Wolves and Leicestershire. He returned to the Malaysian side that October, playing an ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament match against Nepal. After playing several matches for Somerset throughout the 2006 season, he again found himself out of favour in 2007, with his only first-class match coming against Loughborough UCCE in April. He played just one Pro40 match against Durham and two Twenty20 matches against Warwickshire and Northamptonshire. He continued to play for the Somerset Second XI and for Devon and his lack of matches for Somerset have allowed him to return to international duty for Malaysia, and he played in the ACC Twenty20 Cup in Kuwait in October 2007. He returned to the Somerset team during the 2009 season, when he opened the batting alongside Marcus Trescothick in the County Championship, as well as appearing in the majority of Somerset's Friends Provident Trophy and Twenty20 Cup matches. He scored 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the first time in 2009 and was awarded his county cap during the final game of the 2009 County Championship season against Worcestershire. On 5 July 2011, Suppiah set a new world record for best Twenty20 bowling figures, recording 6 for 5 from 3.4 overs for Somerset against Glamorgan at Cardiff. He followed this up with a career best first- class innings of 156 against India, in the touring side's warm-up match before the Test series against England. On 4 July 2013, Suppiah retired from professional cricket with immediate effect at the age of 29 due to serious injuries in both of his knees. He currently works as a business studies teacher for Queens College Taunton.

The 50 series included a wide range of chassis and body configurations, including two distinctly different cab designs, and spanned the revenue weight range. Various engines were offered, including the Perkins Phaser and 4.236. The RB44, a four-wheel-drive version based loosely on the Dodge van, was built by Reynolds Boughton (now known as Boughton Engineering) in the early 1990s. Versions Bodybuilding companies converted many into various configurations from tipper trucks to buses. Many were built as \\"chassis cabs\\" to have box bodies fitted; these were widely used by utility companies in the UK. They often came fitted with compressors and generators. Gradually this kind of vehicle fell out of favour, partly due to reliability issues relating to combining plant equipment with the vehicle drivetrain. The vehicle is otherwise toughly built. The utility companies today favour smaller vans with towed generators. The four-wheel-drive version saw some use with the British army since it was one of very few British-built trucks of the class, and it could carry considerably more stores and equipment than even the largest Land Rover models. Chrysler received financial assistance from the British Government which was desperate to support the ailing British motor industry. However, having inherited various struggling car and commercial vehicle marques (and factories) from the Rootes Group, notably the commercial marques Commer and Karrier, in addition to various French concerns, Chrysler Europe struggled to return a profit. In 1978, Chrysler pulled out of their European operations altogether, selling them to Peugeot. The cars and small vans became known as Talbots. Peugeot takeover However, Peugeot had little interest in commercial vehicles and the factory for the heavier models was run in partnership with Renault V√©hicules Industriels, who sought a UK production site for engines for their existing Renault-branded models. They continued to manufacture the 50 Series, along with the small Dodge (formerly Commer) Spacevan, and the large Dodge 100 / Commando 2 Series of trucks. The transition to Renault branding was slightly muddied by some vehicles bearing both a Dodge name and a Renault-diamond badge. =Renault 50= By 1987, the 50 Series had been updated and was badged as the Renault 50 Series or Desoto 50 Series in Bermuda; the UK incarnation of the Dodge marque ceased to be used for new vehicles. (Chrysler maintained an entirely separate Dodge brand in the U.S., and in 2006 began re-introducing Dodge car models from the USA into the UK market.) Renault continued to manufacture the 50 Series until 1993, but it was never a great sales success, even being forced to compete with other Renault products, in the form of the Master van, which Renault favoured in its export markets. In 1994, Renault ‚Äî keen to clear the factory for large-scale engine production ‚Äî sold the production tooling to a Chinese manufacturer. The 50 series is still being produced in China under a different name.

Early life Nothing, to date, is known of his early life. The famous buccaneer chronicler, Esquemeling, states that Searle was ‚Äúborn at Jamaica,‚Äù but this seems unlikely, since that island did not become an English dominion until 1655. Searle's career as a ‚Äúgentleman of fortune‚Äù was marred by frequent quarrels with Sir Thomas Modyford, royal governor of Jamaica, who usually befriended buccaneers. Piracy =The Cagway= Searle's first known ship was the 60-ton, 8-gun Cagway, the largest of four Spanish merchantmen captured by Sir Christopher Myngs as he returned from his raid on Santa Marta and Tol√∫ (Colombia) in 1659. Four years later, Searle captained the Cagway as part of Myng's expedition against Santiago de Cuba. This force of 1,300 men and a dozen vessels sailed from Port Royal (Jamaica) on 1 October 1662 and two-and-a-half weeks later disembarked to the east of their intended target. Santiago was overrun the following day and a considerable amount of booty carried back to Jamaica. In 1664, the political situation in Europe and the Caribbean was volatile. Constant raiding by English buccaneers had prompted repeated and vociferous protests from Madrid, delivered by the Spanish ambassador to King Charles II of England. In turn, a letter to Governor Modyford from the king stated that ‚ÄúHis Majesty cannot sufficiently express his dissatisfaction at the daily complaints of violence and depredation‚Äù against the Spanish by the ships of Jamaica. Modyford was ‚Äúagain strictly commanded not only to forbid the prosecution of such violence for the future, but to inflict condign punishment upon offenders, and to have the entire restitution and satisfaction made to the sufferers.‚Äù That letter, signed in London 11 days after Modyford first landed at Port Royal, in early June, did not arrive until the beginning of September. It caused something of a sensation on the island. At that moment there were two rich Spanish prizes from Cuba at anchor in Port Royal's harbor. Both were heavily guarded and prizes to Searle, who had already landed the boxes and bags of Spanish coin so that the king's share could be calculated. Modyford promptly summoned the Council of Jamaica and showed them the letter. The alarmed Council decided that the governor of Cuba should be told at once that the captured ships and money were being returned. It was resolved that ‚Äúall persons making further attempts of violence upon the Spaniards be looked upon as pirates and rebels, and that Captain Searle‚Äôs commission be taken from him and his rudder and sails taken ashore for security.‚Äù Searle's ship was restored, rudder and sails intact, with the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665. In early March 1666, he and his crew sailed as one of nine ships and 650 soldiers raised by Colonel Edward Morgan (Sir Henry Morgan‚Äôs uncle) in an expedition against the Dutch islands of Sint Eustatius and Sab√°. This force was described in a letter by Modyford as ‚Äúchiefly reformed privateers, scare a planter amongst them, being resolute fellows and well armed with fusils [muskets ~ed.] and pistols.‚Äù The governor was particularly pleased that they would be serving ‚Äúat the old rate of no purchase, no pay, and it will cost the King nothing considerable, some powder and mortar pieces.‚Äù Although they landed successfully, Morgan dropped dead from heat exhaustion. > The good old colonel, leaping out of the boat and being a corpulent man, got > a strain, and his spirit being great, he pursued overearnestly the enemy on > a hot day, so that he surfeited and suddenly died. While these islands were quickly subdued, the English force disintegrated because of poor plunder and differences over who should succeed the late Col. Morgan as leader. The next year, Searle and a Captain Stedman took two small ships and 80 men to the Dutch island of Tobago, near Trinidad, and sacked the island from end to end. Lord Willoughby, governor of the English colony of Barbados, had also fitted out an expedition to take Tobago, but the Jamaicans were three or four days before him. The latter were busy pillaging when Willoughby arrived and demanded the island in the king's name. The buccaneers condescended to leave the fort and governor's house standing only on the condition that Willoughby gave them liberty to sell their booty in Barbados. Governor Modyford forbade further raids in June 1667 and recalled all privateering commissions issued in Jamaica. Again, he had to deal with Robert Searle, who was to be punished for his part in a straightforward piece of tit- for-tat. Soon after Sir Henry Morgan‚Äôs raid on Maracaibo (Venezuela), Searle and his ship were lying at New Providence in the Bahamas when a vengeful Spanish force attacked the English settlement there. This spurred several angry privateersmen, among them Searle, to sail for Florida and sack the presidio of St. Augustine, Florida in May 1668. Coming so soon after Modyford's proclamation withdrawing all commissions, and so obviously intended as retaliation, the governor decided that he would have to punish the leader, who by general consent was Searle. Henry Woodward, the first settler of South Carolina, had been captured by the Spanish and held at St. Augustine. Searle's 1668 raid resulted in Woodward's escape, who then served for several years as a surgeon on privateer ships.Henry Woodward. Dictionary of American Biography Base Set. American Council of Learned Societies, 1928-1936. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2007. http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC When he returned to Jamaica, Searle guessed that he might be out of favour. Instead of sailing into Port Royal, he took the Cagway to a bay on the southwestern end of the island, out of the governor's reach. Governor Modyford reported to Lord Arlington, England‚Äôs Secretary of State: > There arrived also at Port Morant the Cagway, Captain Searle, with 70 stout > men, who hearing that I was much incensed against him for that action of St. > Augustine, went to Macary Bay, and there rides out of command. I will use > the best ways to apprehend him, without driving his men to despair. =Arrest= Shortly thereafter, Searle ventured ashore and was seized by the governor, who placed him under arrest in Port Royal. Weeks passed without further orders from England and the governor wrote to Arlington again, stating that Searle was still in the custody of Jamaica's Provost Marshal, awaiting trial. =Release= Ironically, he was freed after some months to take part in one of the buccaneer's greatest land battles, Sir Henry Morgan‚Äôs famous sack of Panama City (Panama). Searle was one of Morgan's lieutenants during this renowned action and was given the important task of preventing any Spanish ships from escaping the port. At the port, Searle and his crew discovered a barque lying fast aground, which the Spaniards had attempted to burn. The buccaneers succeeded in extinguishing the fire before much harm had been done. This vessel proved to be a valuable prize and, in a few days, Searle had captured three other ships. Commanding this tiny flotilla, he scoured the islands which stretched offshore ‚Äì Perico, Taboga and Tobogilla, and Otoque, the most distant before reaching the Pearl Islands (Las Islas del Rey). He harried the ill-fated refugees concealed there, taking many prisoners and much property. The President of Panama, Don Juan P√©rez de Guzm√°n wrote: > The English, having got possession of the Relicks of our town, found a Bark > in the Fasca, although I had given order that there should be none, yet had > they not complied with my command, and when they would have set it on Fire, > the Enemy came fast and put it out and with it they did us great damage, for > they took three more with it, and made great havock of all they found in the > Islands of Taboga, Otoque, and Las Islas del Rey, taking and bringing from > thence many Prisoners. Searle was looking primarily for vessels which, laden with valuables, were known to be hiding in various anchorages along the Panama coast or among the islands. On the island of Taboga, while looking for fugitives, Searle and his crew discovered a hidden store of Peruvian wine. The seamen promptly started drinking and by evening, most were helplessly drunk. They were far too drunk to post lookouts and therefore did not notice a Spanish galleon coming from seaward and anchor. Nor did they see a boat being lowered and rowed to shore full of casks. They first learned of all this when they accidentally surprised and captured the boat's seven-man crew as they looked for fresh water. The Spaniards were taken to Searle, who threatened them with torture. He discovered that the ship was none other than the 400-ton Santissima Trinidad very richly laden with all the King's Plate and a great quantity of riches of gold, pearls, jewels, and other most precious goods of all the best and richest merchants of Panama. On board this galleon were also the religious women belonging to the nunnery of the said city, who had embarked with them all the ornaments of the church, consisting of a great quantity of gold, plate, and other things of great value. This single ship, which was reported to be armed with only seven cannon and 10-12 muskets, poorly supplied with food and water, and bearing only the uppermost sails of the main mast, carried the bulk of the gold, silver, and jewels which the government, private citizens, and the Church in Panama had shipped away for safety. Instead of fleeing to Lima (Peru), her captain, Don Francisco de Peralta, had simply put to sea. He apparently intended to return to Panama with his cargo and passengers after the buccaneers had left, since he believed they had no ships. Searle immediately ordered to his men to seize the galleon, but they would not leave their wine or, more likely, were unable to obey. De Peralta, alarmed when his men failed to return and suspicious of the barque moored nearby, weighed anchor with some difficulty and fled into the night, being out of sight by daybreak. When the main body of buccaneers eventually learned of this missed opportunity a few days later, they were outraged. Esquemeling, even writing several years after the event, scornfully related how, when the watering party had been brought before Searle, the old rover ‚Äúhad been more inclined to sit drinking and sporting with a group of Spanish women he had taken prisoner, than to go at once in pursuit of the treasure ship.‚Äù Searle was bitterly reproached by Morgan and never regained his favour. Years later, Captain de Peralta was captured by the English privateer, William Dampier, in the Pacific and told the story of his narrow escape from Searle with much relish. Death In later years, Robert Searle relocated to Honduras, where William Dampier wrote that he was killed in a duel with an Indigenous logwood cutter. Thus the Jamaican buccaneer met his death near a small sandy islet at the northern end of the Gulf of Campeache (in the Laguna de T√©rminos), known to his brother pirates as ‚ÄúSerles's Key.‚Äù > At the North-end, and about the middle of the East Lagune, there is another > small Creek like that which comes out against One-Bush-Key, but less and > shallower, which dischargeth it self into Laguna Termina, against a small > sandy Key, called by the English Serles's Key, from one Captain Serles, who > first careen‚Äôd his vessel here, and was afterwards killed in the Western > Lagune, by one of his company as they were cutting Logwood together.

They are considered by some scientists to be mildly venomous and are what is commonly termed as 'rear-fanged' or more appropriately, opisthoglyphous, meaning their enlarged teeth or fangs, intended to aid in venom delivery, are located in the back of the upper jaw, instead of in the front as they are in vipers or cobras. As colubrids, Ahaetulla do not possess a true venom gland or a sophisticated venom delivery system. The Duvernoy's gland of this genus, homologous to the venom gland of true venomous snakes, produces a secretion which, though not well studied, is considered not to be medically significant to humans. Geographic range They are found from Sri Lanka and India to China and much of Southeast Asia, including many Pacific Islands.  Species  The taxonomy of vine snakes is not well-documented, and literature varies widely, but there are 9 - 10 commonly accepted species in the genus Ahaetulla: *Ahaetulla anomala (Annandale, 1906) \\\\- Variable colored vine snake *Ahaetulla dispar (G√ºnther, 1864) \\\\- G√ºnther's vine snake or Indian bronzeback *Ahaetulla fasciolata (Fischer, 1885) \\\\- Speckle-headed whipsnake *Ahaetulla fronticincta (G√ºnther, 1858) \\\\- Burmese vine snake *Ahaetulla laudankia Deepak, Narayanan, Sarkar, Dutta & Mohapatra, 2019 \\\\- Laudankia vine snake *Ahaetulla mycterizans (Linnaeus, 1758) \\\\- Malayan green whipsnake *Ahaetulla nasuta (La C√©p√®de, 1789) \\\\- Long-nosed whip snake *Ahaetulla perroteti (Dum√©ril & Bibron, 1854) \\\\- Western Ghats bronzeback *Ahaetulla prasina (Boie, 1827) \\\\- Oriental whipsnake or Asian vine snake **Ahaetulla prasina prasina (Boie, 1827) **Ahaetulla prasina medioxima Lazell, 2002 **Ahaetulla prasina preocularis (Taylor, 1922) **Ahaetulla prasina suluensis Gaulke, 1994 *Ahaetulla pulverulenta (Dum√©ril & Bibron, 1854) \\\\- Brown- speckled whipsnake The monotypic genus Proahaetulla, described only in 2019, is considered the sister taxon to all members of the genus Ahaetulla. They diverged from each other as early as the mid-Oligocene.Ahaetulla prasina, showing keyhole shaped pupil  Description  All Ahaetulla species are characterized by thin, elongated bodies, with extremely long tails and a sharply triangular shaped head. They are primarily green in color, but can vary quite a bit to yellows, oranges, greys, and browns. They can have black and/or white patterning, or can be solid in color. Their eyes are almost unique in the reptile world, having keen binocular vision and keyhole shaped pupils, being similar in this aspect with twig snakes, who also have keyhole shaped pupils. Etymology Ahaetulla nasuta, Ezhimala, Kerala, India. Note the exotic black and white interstices. The genus name Ahaetulla comes from the Sinhalese name ehetulla for Ahaetulla nasuta, which means 'eye plucker' or 'eye striker.  Behavior  They are primarily diurnal and arboreal, living in humid rainforests. Their diet consists mainly of lizards, but sometimes frogs and rodents are also consumed. Ahaetulla fronticincta, however, feeds exclusively on fish, striking its prey from branches overhanging water. Ahaetulla venom is not considered to be dangerous to humans, but serves to cause paralysis in their fast moving prey choices. They are ovoviviparous. Ahaetulla prasina, showing rear-set fang  In captivity  Ahaetulla species are not yet frequently captive bred, as are many of the more popular snakes in the reptile keeping hobby. They are suitable for more advanced keepers, requiring a humid arboreal habitat and a diet of lizards as they rarely switch to rodents. Without proper husbandry, they are prone to health issues and stress.

Lihula is a town in L√§√§neranna Parish, P√§rnu County, Estonia.  Lihula castle  The castle of Lihula () was first mentioned in 1211, but it appears the site was used as a fortress since the Iron Age. In 1220, a Swedish army started constructing a castle here, but were defeated by Estonian forces on 8 August 1220, in the Battle of Lihula. In 1238, however, the bishop of Saare-L√§√§ne () constructed a crusader fortress at the site, in cooperation with the Teutonic Order. This attempt was more successful and the castle became one of the residences of the bishop. The Teutonic Order also used the castle as a centre of their commandry between 1241 and 1477. In 1560, the estate was reportedly granted to alderman Gerdt Bellingshausen by Duke Magnus of Holstein. In the course of the Livonian War, the castle was destroyed. =Lihula Manor= The main street of the town Lihula Despite the fact that the castle was destroyed during the Livonian War, a new manorial estate grew up right next to the original location thereafter. In the 1630s, it was recorded as the property of the Swedish general √Öke Tott. The manor stayed in the Tott family until 1684, after which it belonged to various aristocratic families. The present neoclassicist manor house was built in the early 19th century.  Episcopal See  From 1211, it was the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leal (also known as bishopric of Estonia), which was however suppressed as such in 1235, to establish on the same territory the Diocese of Dorpat, a prince-bishopric, which lasted till 1558, falling victim to the Reformation.  Lihula Monument  For a short period there was a monument in Lihula, honoring those Estonian soldiers who fought in the (Nazi) German Army against the Soviet Union during World War II. By the order of prime minister Juhan Parts, the authorities removed the monument and as of June 2007, it stands in the Museum of Fight for Estonia's Freedom in Tallinn.

It was part of an abortive attempt by members of the Liberal Party to establish a breakaway group. No actual party was ever formed, but the name was frequently applied to the group of dissident MPs by the press. The leaders of the Radical Party proposal were George Russell and Frederick Pirani, both Liberal Party MPs. Russell and Pirani, along with other MPs such as William Collins and George Smith, were dissatisfied with the Liberal Party under Richard Seddon, believing that it had lost its commitment to its founding ideals. Both were considered to belong to the Liberal Party's left wing. In 1896, Russell spoke openly about formalising \\"the advanced section of the Liberal Party,\\" either as an organised faction in the Liberal caucus or as a separate party. However, the new group failed to emerge. Tensions appeared to rise between its various members, with rumours circulating that neither Russell nor Pirani would concede the leadership to the other. The MPs whose names had been mentioned in connection with the Radical Party distanced themselves from it, stating that they had never made any commitments. Pirani and Smith both left the Liberal Party the same year, becoming independents. In 1905 a similar group, the New Liberal Party was formed, but this group was defunct by 1908.

Spector treated a series of mostly secular Christmas standards to his \\"Wall of Sound\\" treatment, and the selections feature the vocal performances of Spector's regular artists during this period. The album peaked at No. 13 on Billboard magazine's special, year-end, weekly Christmas Albums sales chart in December 1963. The album was reissued by Apple Records in 1972, with different cover art‚Äîa photograph of Spector dressed as a heavily bearded Santa Claus, wearing a \\"Back to Mono\\" button‚Äîand retitled Phil Spector's Christmas Album. This version of the album went to No. 6 on Billboard's special Christmas Albums sales chart in December of that year, which was its highest chart ranking. It was also in 1972 that the album made its debut on the UK Albums Chart; it would re-chart in 1983, peaking at No. 19. On the week ending December 15, 2018, A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector entered the main Billboard 200 albums chart for the first time (at position No. 48), eventually peaking at No. 12 three weeks later (on the week ending January 5, 2019). In 2003, the album was voted No. 142 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. In 2017, it was ranked the 130th greatest album of the 1960s by Pitchfork. In 2019, it was ranked the greatest Christmas album of all time by Rolling Stone. Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys has cited this album as his favorite of all time.

Universe. . Recording and production The album was recorded between throughout September and October 1963. Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys attempted to contribute his piano playing to \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\", but was rejected because of his low performing ability. Reception The album, released in the United States on November 22, 1963‚Äîthe same day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated‚Äîwas a relative failure at the time.Jack Hamilton, \\"Did JFK's Death Make Beatlemania Possible? The Questionable Connections Between Camelot's Demise and Liverpool's Ascent.\\" Slate, November 18, 2013. Retrieved December 13, 2016. Original pressings are scarce and collectable, now selling for $400‚Äì$500 in excellent condition. In subsequent years, especially after its reissue on Apple, the album grew in popularity and is considered now to be a holiday classic. Several of its tracks became iconic Christmas songs for generations, such as the original (and flop) single \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),\\" and the well-known \\"Ring-a-ling-a-ling Ding-dong-ding\\" background vocals in the Ronettes' \\"Sleigh Ride\\". The arrangement of Bruce Springsteen's version of \\"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\\" is based in part on the Crystals' version of the song, and U2's late-1980s remake of \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" that appeared on the first A Very Special Christmas album is patterned after the Darlene Love original that appeared on the Spector LP. The Ronettes' versions of \\"Frosty The Snowman\\" and \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\" also usually get some radio airplay during the holiday season. Release history The album has been released several times on different labels: the original release on Philles and the 1972 reissue on Apple were followed by additional reissues on Warner-Spector (1974; this was the first release to feature a stereo mix of the songs, although it ironically used the \\"Back to Mono\\" Apple cover), Pavilion (1981, also in stereo, using the Apple artwork, but with the \\"Back to Mono\\" button airbrushed out), Impression (1983), Passport (1984), and Rhino (1987). The first CD issue was also on Rhino in 1987, co-credited to Phil Spector International RNCD 70235 and restoring the album's original mono mix. The second CD issue was in 1987 as well, on Chrysalis (CCD 1625) in monophonic for the UK market. This one is co- credited \\"Spector Records International\\" and features the slightly different international artwork. The more common third CD issue came in 1989, a remastered release on ABKCO which restored the original title, artwork, and mono mix. The album also appeared as the fourth disc of ABKCO's 1991 Spector box set, Back to Mono, and as the second disc of the 2006 UK-only ABKCO compilation The Phil Spector Collection. Sony Music took over distribution rights to the Philles Records catalog in 2009 and re-released the mono album, remastered by Bob Ludwig, on its Legacy Recordings imprint on October 27 of that year. (The Sundazed label also reissued the album on vinyl in 2009.) In 2012, Legacy Recordings released a two-disc set in the UK only, containing a new remastering of the mono album by Vic Anesini on the first disc and a selection of non-Christmas Spector hits and rarities on the second disc.

Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. Flowering Plant Families of the World. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007). Whittonia is possibly extinct, being known from only one specimen collected below Kaieteur Falls in Guyana. In 2006, archeologists attempted to rediscover it, however, it proved unsuccessful. The largest genus is Soyauxia, with about seven species. Medusandra has two species. Peridiscus and Whittonia each contain one species. The Peridiscaceae are small trees or erect shrubs of wet tropical forests. It was not until 2009 that all four of the genera were united into a single family. Peridiscus and Whittonia are clearly close relatives. This pair, and the other two genera have long been considered anomalous, being variously classified by different authors.  Description  The following description was created by combining descriptions of Medusandra and Peridiscus by John Hutchinson John Hutchinson. The Families of Flowering Plants, Third Edition (1973). Oxford University Press: London. with descriptions of Soyauxia, Peridiscus, and Whittonia by Clemens Bayer. Peridiscaceae are small trees or erect shrubs. The leaves are stipulate, alternate, and simple, with margins that are entire or remotely crenulate (Medusandra). The petiole is pulvinate, at its apex, sometimes obscurely so. The stipules are in the axils of the leaves, sometimes enclosing an axillary bud. The inflorescence is a cluster of axillary racemes or spikes, the clusters often being reduced to a pair of racemes or to a single raceme. The flowers are bisexual and actinomorphic. The sepals are 4 to 7 in number, and free, that is, separate from each other. Medusandra and Soyauxia have five petals. Peridiscus and Whittonia have none. Medusandra lacks a nectary disk and has five stamens, inserted opposite the petals, and alternating with five long, hairy staminodes. In the others, the stamens are numerous and arranged in a ring around the nectary disk. The anthers are tetrathecal in Medusandra and Soyauxia; bithecal in Peridiscus and Whittonia. The perianth parts are attached below the ovary. The ovary is therefore superior, but appears half- inferior in Peridiscus because the ovary is embedded in the large, fleshy disk. The gynoecium consists of three or four carpels, united to form a unilocular ovary. The placentation is apical, with two ovules at the apex of each carpel. The ovary has a central column in Medusandra and Soyauxia. Each carpel bears a stylulus and these are well separated at the apex of the ovary. The fruit is one-seeded; a capsule in Medusandra and Soyauxia; a drupe in Peridiscus and Whittonia.  History  George Bentham established the genus Peridiscus in 1862, naming its only species Peridiscus lucidus. He placed it in a group which he called \\"Tribus Flacourtieae\\" and which later would be known as the family Flacourtiaceae.George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker. 1862. Genera Plantarum volume 1, part 1, page 127. A. Black, William Pamplin, Lovell Reeve & Co., Williams & Norgate: London, England. (see External links below). Bentham wrote no etymology for this name, but it is generally believed that the name refers to the fact that the stamens are attached along the outer edge of the nectary disk.Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names. volume III, page 2010. CRC Press: Baton Rouge, New York, London, Washington DC. . (see External links below) Daniel Oliver established the genus Soyauxia in 1880 for Soyauxia gabonensis, placing it in the family Passifloraceae.Joseph Dalton Hooker. 1880. Hooker's Icones Plantarum volume XIV (volume IV of the third series):page 73 and plate 1393. (see External links below). He named it for the German botanist and plant collector Hermann Soyaux,Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names. volume IV, page 2521. CRC Press: Baton Rouge, New York, London, Washington DC. . saying \\"Mons. Soyaux, now settled in the Gaboon, well deserves that his name should be associated with one of his interesting discoveries in that region\\". The family Flacourtiaceae was, as Hermann Sleumer said, a fiction,Regis B. Miller (1975). \\"Systematic anatomy of the xylem and comments on the relationships of Flacourtiaceae\\". Journal of the Arnold Arboretum 56(1):79.Mark W. Chase, Sue Zmarzty, M. Dolores Lled√≥, Kenneth J. Wurdack, Susan M. Swensen, and Michael F. Fay. 2002. \\"When in doubt, put it in Flacourtiaceae: a molecular phylogenetic analysis based on plastid rbcL DNA sequences.\\" Kew Bulletin 57(1):141-181. and Peridiscus was, from the outset, one of its most doubtful members. Recognizing its distinctiveness, Jo√£o Kuhlmann segregated it into its own family in 1947.Jo√£o G. Kuhlmann. 1947. \\"Peridiscaceae (Kuhlmann)\\". Arquivos do Servi√ßo Florestal 3(1):3-7. In 1952, John Brenan named and described Medusandra, erecting a new family, Medusandraceae to accommodate it.John P.M. Brenan. 1952. \\"Plants of the Cambridge Expedition, 1947-1948: II. A new order of flowering plants from the British Cameroons\\". Kew Bulletin 7:227-236. In 1953, Brenan transferred Soyauxia from Passifloraceae to Medusandraceae,John P.M. Brenan. 1953. \\"Soyauxia, a second genus of Medusandraceae\\". Kew Bulletin 8:507-511. but few others agreed with his classification. In 1954, John Hutchinson and John McEwen Dalziel followed Brenan's treatment in the second edition of their Flora of West Tropical Africa. Hutchinson, however, soon recanted, explaining in some detail why he thought that Medusandra and Soyauxia were not related. In 1962, Noel Y. Sandwith named and described Whittonia.Noel Y. Sandwith. 1962. \\"Contributions to the flora of tropical America: LXIX. A new genus of Peridiscaceae\\". Kew Bulletin 15:467-471. In an accompanying article, Charles Russell Metcalfe discussed its close relationship to Peridiscus. For four decades thereafter, Peridiscaceae was viewed as a family of uncertain taxonomic position, containing two genera. In the year 2000, a DNA sequence for the rbcL gene of Whittonia was produced and used in a molecular phylogenetic study of the eudicots.Vincent Savolainen, Michael F. Fay, Dirk C. Albach, Anders Backlund, Michelle van der Bank, Kenneth M. Cameron, S.A. Johnson, M. Dolores Lledo, Jean-Christophe Pintaud, Martyn P. Powell, Mary Clare Sheahan, Douglas E. Soltis, Pamela S. Soltis, Peter Weston, W. Mark Whitten, Kenneth J. Wurdack and Mark W. Chase. 2000. \\"Phylogeny of the eudicots: a nearly complete familial analysis based on rbcL gene sequences\\". Kew Bulletin 55(2):257-309. This study placed Peridiscaceae in a clade with Elatinaceae and Malpighiaceae, a very surprising and unexpected result. On the basis of this phylogeny, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group placed Peridiscaceae in Malpighiales when they published the APG II system of plant classification in 2003.The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. 2003. \\"An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG II\\". Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 141(4):399-436. It was soon found that the rbcL sequence for Whittonia was a chimera, formed by DNA from unidentified plants that had contaminated the sample. No subsequent attempt to extract DNA from Whittonia has been made. In 2004, using DNA from Peridiscus, it was shown that Elatinaceae and Malpighiaceae are indeed sister families and that Peridiscaceae belong to Saxifragales. Medusandra and Soyauxia, meanwhile, were listed in APG II in an appendix entitled \\"TAXA OF UNCERTAIN POSITION\\". DNA from Soyauxia was eventually obtained, and in 2007, it was shown that Soyauxia is most closely related to Peridiscus and, presumably, Whittonia. Since this result has a good morphological basis, Soyauxia was duly transferred to Peridiscaceae. This study also found strong statistical support for the inclusion of Peridiscaceae in Saxifragales, but no strong support for any particular position within that order. In 2008, in a study employing a large amount of chloroplast DNA data, as well as some mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, it was shown that Peridiscaceae is sister to the rest of Saxifragales.Shuguang Jian, Pamela S. Soltis, Matthew A. Gitzendanner, Michael J. Moore, Ruiqi Li, Tory A. Hendry, Yin-Long Qiu, Amit Dhingra, Charles D. Bell, and Douglas E. Soltis. 2008. \\"Resolving an Ancient, Rapid Radiation in Saxifragales\\". Systematic Biology 57(1):38-57. It had been suspected that Medusandra might belong somewhere in Malpighiales, but a phylogeny of that order, generated in 2009, placed Medusandra in Saxifragales. The authors had included Medusandra and a few other members of Saxifragales in their outgroup, finding strong support for a clade of [Medusandra + (Soyauxia + Peridiscus)]. When the APG III system was published in October 2009, Peridiscaceae was expanded to include Medusandra and Soyauxia. John Brenan, 57 years before, had been prescient in his perception of a relationship between Medusandra and Soyauxia.  Phylogeny  The phylogeny is diagrammed as a phylogenetic tree below. The relationships shown are from Wurdack and Davis (2009) except for the position of Whittonia, for which no DNA sequences are known. Peridiscus and Whittonia are undoubtedly sister taxa due to their many shared morphological characters.

It was incorporated by the U.S. Congress in 1866 as a transcontinental railroad connecting Springfield, Missouri and Van Buren, Arkansas with California. The central portion was never constructed, and the two halves later became parts of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway systems, now both merged into the BNSF Railway. History The A&P;'s earliest predecessor was the Pacific Railroad, incorporated by the Missouri General Assembly in 1849 to connect St. Louis and a point south of Kansas City across the center of the state. In response to an 1852 federal law granting public lands to Missouri to aid in constructing two cross-state railroads, the state approved an amendment to the 1849 Pacific Railroad law in December 1852, adding a Southwest Branch that would receive the grants. The new branch, defined by state law to lie south of the Osage River, began at Franklin, Missouri,(now Pacific) on the main line and headed west-southwesterly across the state. Construction on from Franklin to Dillon was completed in 1860, and a further to Rolla were opened in 1861. The company graded more to Arlington, but after it defaulted on bonds that had been issued for the branch, the state seized the road from Franklin to Rolla and incomplete roadbed to Arlington in March 1866. The property was sold in June for $1.3 million to explorer and politician John C. Fr√©mont, who reorganized it as the Southwest Pacific Railroad in September. (The main line of the Pacific Railroad was not sold, and would later become the Missouri Pacific Railroad.)Interstate Commerce Commission, 41 Val. Rep. 139 (1933): St. Louis- San Francisco Railway CompanyJohn Bell Sanborn, Congressional Grants of Land in Aid of Railways, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, 1899, pp. 115-126 In July 1866, Congress passed a law incorporating the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad under control of Fr√©mont and associates. The company was given the power to build near the 35th parallel from Springfield, Missouri west to the Pacific, with a branch from Van Buren, Arkansas. In exchange for its completion by 1878, the railroad would receive land grants along its route. The same conditions were applied to the Southern Pacific Railroad of California, which could build a branch to connect to the A&P; near the eastern border of that state. The A&P; purchased the Southwest Pacific in January 1867, and that year rails were laid on the grade to Arlington. That company, too, defaulted on its payments, and the state of Missouri again seized the property in June 1867, selling it to a new South Pacific Railroad in July 1868. Ownership of the A&P; was also transferred to the new owners, which included Clinton B. Fisk of St. Louis. Another to Pierce City and of grading to Seneca on the state line were completed in 1870, when, in October, the South Pacific sold its property to the A&P.; That company laid rails to Neosho that year and to Seneca, and beyond to Vinita, Oklahoma, in 1871, and in June 1872 it leased the Pacific (later Missouri Pacific) Railroad, which operated a line to Kansas City and branches, including several into Kansas. The A&P;'s only branch, to a mine near Granby, Missouri, was built in 1875. But this incarnation had similar financial problems; its Missouri division (Franklin to Seneca) was placed under receivership in November 1875, and the Pacific Railroad lease was canceled. The owners of the A&P; incorporated the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway in September 1876, and immediately acquired the property of the Missouri division, and a lease on the Central division (Seneca to Vinita). Extensions beyond Vinita for to Tulsa (1882), to Red Fork (1885), and to Sapulpa (1886) were included in the lease. The SL&SF; also constructed a direct line into St. Louis in 1883, ending its dependence on the Missouri Pacific for access to that city. Western division $1000 bond issued 1880 In January 1880, the SL&SF; came to an agreement with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, which had recently entered New Mexico from the north, whereby the two companies would jointly control the A&P.; The SL&SF; would continue to operate the Central division, and a new Western division would begin on the AT&SF; at Isleta, New Mexico and head west to meet the Southern Pacific at Needles, California. Construction began that year, and reached Kingman, Arizona in 1882. The SP began building a branch from Mojave, California that same year, east to Needles, where the two met on August 9, 1883. The A&P;, then essentially an operating subsidiary of the AT&SF;, leased the line from the SP in August 1884, and in November 1885 the AT&SF-owned; California Southern Railroad completed its line over Cajon Pass to the SP's Needles branch at Barstow, giving the AT&SF; access to the coast. Tenth Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of California for the Year Ending December 31, 1889, pp. 11-15 In addition to its lease of the SP to Mojave, the A&P; operated via trackage rights over the AT&SF; from Isleta to Albuquerque.Interstate Commerce Commission, 127 I. C. C. 1 (1927): Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company Atlantic and Pacific Railroad cars near Winslow, Arizona, ca. 1890 The AT&SF; gained control of the SL&SF; in 1890, but both companies entered receivership in December of 1893 after the Panic of 1893, and the A&P; followed in January 1894. That road's Western division was sold to the newly created AT&SF; subsidiary Santa Fe Pacific Railroad in June 1897, and the remaining Central division was sold under foreclosure to the reorganized SL&SF;, which was again independent of the AT&SF;, in December 1897, ending the A&P;'s existence. Through the Santa Fe Pacific, the AT&SF; acquired trackage rights in January 1899 over the SP's Tehachapi Pass line, giving it access to the Central Valley of California and San Francisco Bay Area.Donald Duke and Stan Kistler, Santa Fe: Steel Rails Through California, 1963, p. 51 The Santa Fe Pacific left the SP at Kern Junction, where the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway - another AT&SF; subsidiary - began, and operated into Bakersfield via SF&SJV; trackage. The AT&SF; bought the railroad property of the Santa Fe Pacific in July 1902, and its non-operating subsidiary California, Arizona and Santa Fe Railway bought the leased Southern Pacific line between Mojave and Needles in December 1911, but the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad continued to own its land grants from the A&P;, and the Santa Fe Pacific continued to exist as a subsidiary of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, successor to the AT&SF.;BNSF Railway, Class I Railroad Annual Report To The Surface Transportation Board For the Year Ending December 31, 2007, p. 4 The gap across Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico was eventually filled in 1904, when the Arkansas Valley and Western Railway, an SL&SF; subsidiary, completed its line from Tulsa to Avard, Oklahoma, on the AT&SF;'s line through the Texas Panhandle.

It is a rapid and specific method widely used in clinical diagnostics and analysis of microbial communities in food, water, and beverages. All bacteria have ribosomal genes, but the exact sequence is unique to each species, serving as a genetic fingerprint. Therefore, sequencing the particular 16S gene and comparing it to a database would yield identification of the particular species. Technique Ribotyping involves the digestion of bacterial genomic DNA with specific restriction enzymes. Each restriction enzyme cuts DNA at a specific nucleotide sequence, resulting in fragments of different lengths. Those fragments are then run on a Gel electrophoresis, where they are separated according to size: the application of electrical field to the gel in which they are suspended causes the movement of DNA fragments (all negatively charged due to the presence of phosphate groups) through a matrix towards the positively charged end of the field. Small fragments move more easily and rapidly through the matrix, reaching a bigger distance from the starting position than larger fragments. Following the separation in the gel matrix, the DNA fragments are moved onto nylon membranes and hybridized with a labelled 16S or 23S rRNA probe. This way only the fragments coding for such rRNA are visualised and can be analyzed. The pattern is then digitized and used to identify the origin of the DNA by a comparison with reference organisms in a computer database. Conceptually, ribotyping is similar to probing restriction fragments of chromosomal DNA with cloned probes (randomly cloned probes or probes derived from a specific coding sequence such as that of a virulence factor).Grimont, F., and P.

History Ruins of Castle Hasenpoth now Aizpute Castle, build in 13th century. The territory of modern Aizpute was inhabited by ancient Curonians since the 9th century. St. John Lutheran church was built on the Curonian hillfort. In the 13th century during the Livonian crusade, the territory of Aizpute was conquered by German crusaders. In 1248 the master of the Livonian Order Dietrich von Gr√ºningen ordered the building of a stone castle in Aizpute. The castle and the whole settlement became known as Hasenpoth. After the partition of Courland in 1253 Aizpute became part of the Bishopric of Courland. In 1260 Aizpute church was built. Bishop of Courland Otto granted Magdeburg rights to Aizpute in 1378. In the second half of the 16th century Aizpute experienced rapid development because the Tebra river was used as the main trade route for the merchants of Aizpute who shipped their cargo down to the sea. After the Polish-Swedish war all trade and shipping infrastructure was destroyed and Aizpute started to experience decline. During the period 1611-1795 it was under the power of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth as a capital of the semi-autonomous Powiat Piltynski (District of Piltene). In 1795 Aizpute and the whole of Courland was incorporated into the Russian Empire and became part of the Courland Governorate. During the Russian revolution of 1905 Aizpute was one of the places where local revolutionists showed armed resistance to Cossack punitive units. It led to the so-called Aizpute War.

The title track consists of Riley's overdubbed improvisations on several keyboard and percussion instruments, including electric organ, electric harpsichord, dumbec, and tambourine. The B-side \\"Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band\\" is a saxophone-based drone piece featuring tape loops and edits, drawn from Riley's all-night improvisatory performances in the 1960s. Riley's record deal with CBS was part of a short- lived album series on American experimental music helmed by CBS employee David Behrman, who also facilitated the release of Riley's 1968 album In C; these two were the most successful LPs in the series. The album subsequently influenced a number of rock and electronic productions. Background In the late 1960s, composer David Behrman was working for CBS Records's Columbia imprint as an editor when he visited Terry Riley in his New York apartment, witnessing his use of tape loops as accompaniment for his saxophone playing (achieved via the use of two Revox tape recorders running into one other). Riley had previously used this tape loop approach for productions such as Music for The Gift (1963). In 1967, Behrman had received permission from CBS to curate a series of albums on the American experimental music scene titled Music of Our Time, which would eventually include recordings by Steve Reich, Pauline Oliveros and Richard Maxfield. The first of Riley's releases on CBS was a 1968 recording of In C; the second would be A Rainbow in Curved Air. A Rainbow in Curved Air was the first recording at CBS to utilize an eight-track recorder. The largely improvisational nature of the work, based on modal scales, owes much to Riley's background in jazz improvisation and interest in Hindustani classical music. Jazz pianist Bill Evans, one of Riley's piano \\"heroes\\",http://www.21st-centurymusic.com/ML210402.pdf had utilized overdubbing on his classic album Conversations with Myself from four years earlier. Riley would intensify this overdubbing approach with added instrumentation. Music Using overdubbing, Riley plays all the instruments on the title track: electric organ, 2 electric harpsichords (a Baldwin electric harpsichord & a RMI Rock-Si-Chord), dumbec, and tambourine. The piece moves through several sections; following the opening theme and introduction of \\"placid chords,\\" Riley introduces \\"an explosion, a procession of right-hand lines that flutter and pirouette over the over the pulsing rhythmic patterns.\\" The calmer second half of the recording features shorter, high-register keyboard lines which syncopate with the music's modal base. The B-side of the original LP is titled \\"Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band.\\" It is a saxophone- based drone piece featuring tape loops and jump cuts. The piece is a version of the performances given at Riley's \\"All-Night Flight\\" concerts in the late 1960s. It employs overdubbing, with Riley again playing all instruments, (with saxophone inspired by the playing of John Coltrane). Riley used a time lag accumulator, consisting of two tape machines, looped audio tape, and a patch cord. The titular Phantom Band refers to Riley's tape delay accompaniment. A note on the album explains that \\"The spatially separated mirror images were adapted for studio recording by Glen Kolotkin and resemble the sound Terry gets in his all-night concerts.\\" Release and legacy The original LP jacket includes a idealistic poem on the back cover, written by Riley, which depicts a world in which the Pentagon is \\"turned on its side and painted purple, yellow & green within a plainly psychedelic environment\\" and \\"the concept of work was forgotten.\\" Writing for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau opined positively that \\"title side of this has to be a fair approximation of the music of the spheres.\\" The album received a favorable review in Rolling Stone. The album inspired Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells and Pete Townshend's organ parts on The Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" and \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" the latter named in tribute to Riley and to Meher Baba. It has also inspired progressive, jazz fusion band Soft Machine's instrumental piece \\"Out bloody rageous\\". A Rainbow in Curved Air has also had a significant impact on the developments of minimalism, ambient music, jazz fusion, new-age music, progressive rock, and subsequent electronic music. It foreshadows the later overdubbed instrumental works composed by Steve Reich. The 1970s progressive rock band Curved Air named itself after this album. The album's title track is also featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV on the in-game radio station \\"The Journey.\\" Some of the music on this album was used as the background accompaniment of The Guide in the original BBC Radio 4 series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. Was sampled/copied as the sound effects for the 1980 arcade game Moon Cresta. Other appearances In 2009 the track \\"Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band\\" featured in the BBC documentary Prog Rock Britannia: An Observation in Three Movements. On April 26, 2007, Riley gave a live performance of A Rainbow in Curved Air (Revisited). Necessarily, he had to be assisted by other performers: Willi Wynant on percussion and Mikhail Graham working synthesizers and samples.

In the later stages of AIDS, it can be very severe. It usually first presents as a persistent cough. It is typically treated with a series of three antibiotics for a period of at least six months. M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. chimaera are each saprotrophic organisms present in soil and water; entry into hosts is usually via the gastrointestinal tract, but also can be via the lungs. MAC infections can cause fevers, diarrhea, malabsorption, as well as loss of appetite and weight loss, and can disseminate to the bone marrow. MAI is typically resistant to standard mycobacterial therapies.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms are similar to tuberculosis (TB), and include fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Pulmonary involvement is similar to TB, while diarrhea and abdominal pain are associated with gastrointestinal involvement. =Children = M. avium and M. haemophilum infections in children form a distinct clinical entity, not associated with abnormalities of the immune system. M. avium typically causes unilateral swelling of one of the lymph nodes of the neck. This node is firm at the beginning, but a 'collar-stud' abscess is formed eventually, which is a characteristic blue-purple in colour with multiple discharging sinuses. The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the affected lymph nodes, with antibiotic treatment (usually clarithromycin and rifabutin for 18 to 24 months) reserved for those patients who cannot have surgery. Cause MAC bacteria are common in the environment and cause infection when inhaled or swallowed. Recently, M. avium has been found to deposit and grow in bathroom shower heads from which it may be easily aerosolized and inhaled.Showerheads may harbor bacteria dangerous to some By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, AP Science Writer Randolph E. Schmid, Ap Science Writer ‚Äì Mon Sep 14, 9:19 pm ET =Bacteria= Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), also called Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare complex, is a microbial complex of three Mycobacterium species (i.e. M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. chimaera. It causes Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection. Some sources also include Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Risk factors MAI is common in immunocompromised individuals, including senior citizens and those with HIV/AIDS or cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis, the bronchial condition which causes pathological enlargement of the bronchial tubes, is commonly found with MAI infection. Whether the bronchiectasis leads to the MAC infection or is the result of it is not always known. The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) includes common atypical bacteria, i.e. nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), found in the environment which can infect people with HIV and low CD4 cell count (below 100/microliter); mode of infection is usually inhalation or ingestion. MAC causes disseminated disease in up to 40% of people with HIV in the United States, producing fever, sweats, weight loss, and anemia. Disseminated MAC (DMAC) characteristically affects people with advanced HIV disease and peripheral CD4 cell counts less than 50 cells/uL. Effective prevention and therapy of MAC has the potential to contribute substantially to improved quality of life and duration of survival for HIV-infected persons.  Pathophysiology  MAC is the most commonly found form of NTM. Immunodeficiency is not a requirement for MAI. MAC usually affects patients with abnormal lungs or bronchi. However, Jerome Reich and Richard Johnson describe a series of six patients with MAC infection of the right middle lobe or lingula who did not have any predisposing lung disorders. The right middle lobe and lingula of the lungs are served by bronchi that are oriented downward when a person is in the upright position. As a result, these areas of the lung may be more dependent upon vigorous voluntary expectoration (cough) for clearance of bacteria and secretions. Since the six patients in their retrospective case series were older females, Reich and Johnson proposed that patients without a vigorous cough may develop right middle lobe or left lingular infection with MAC. They proposed this syndrome be named Lady Windermere syndrome, after the character Lady Windermere in Oscar Wilde's play Lady Windermere's Fan. However, little research has confirmed this speculative cause. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be achieved through blood cultures or cultures of other bodily fluids such as sputum. Bone marrow culture can often yield an earlier diagnosis but is usually avoided as an initial diagnostic step because of its invasiveness. Many people will have anemia and neutropenia if the bone marrow is involved. MAC bacteria should always be considered in a person with HIV infection presenting with diarrhea. The diagnosis requires consistent symptoms with two additional signs: *Chest X-ray or CT scan showing evidence of right middle lobe (or left lingular lobe) lung infection *Sputum culture or bronchoalveolar lavage culture demonstrating the infection is caused by MAC Disseminated MAC is most readily diagnosed by one positive blood culture. Blood cultures should be performed in patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities compatible with mycobacterium infection. Blood cultures are not routinely recommended for asymptomatic persons, even for those who have CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/uL. = HIV infection = MAC in patients with HIV disease is theorized to represent recent acquisition rather than latent infection reactivating (which is the case in many other opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients). The risk of MAC is inversely related to the patient's CD4 count and increases significantly when the CD4 count decreases below 50 cells/mm¬≥. Other risk factors for acquisition of MAC infection include using an indoor swimming pool, consumption of raw or partially cooked fish or shellfish, bronchoscopy and treatment with granulocyte stimulating factor. Disseminated disease was previously the common presentation prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Today, in regions where HAART is the standard of care, localized disease presentation is more likely. This generally includes a focal lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis. Prevention People with AIDS are given macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin for prophylactic treatment. People with HIV infection and less than 50 CD4 cells/uL should be administered prophylaxis against MAC. Prophylaxis should be continued for the patient's lifetime unless multiple drug therapy for MAC becomes necessary because of the development of MAC disease. Clinicians must weigh the potential benefits of MAC prophylaxis against the potential for toxicities and drug interactions, the cost, the potential to produce resistance in a community with a high rate of tuberculosis, and the possibility that the addition of another drug to the medical regimen may adversely affect patients' compliance with treatment. Because of these concerns, therefore, in some situations rifabutin prophylaxis should not be administered. Before prophylaxis is administered, patients should be assessed to ensure that they do not have the active disease due to MAC, M. tuberculosis, or any other mycobacterial species. This assessment may include a chest radiograph and tuberculin skin test. Rifabutin, by mouth daily, is recommended for the people's lifetime unless disseminated MAC develops, which would then require multiple drug therapy. Although other drugs, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, have laboratory and clinical activity against MAC, none has been shown in a prospective, controlled trial to be effective and safe for prophylaxis. Thus, in the absence of data, no other regimen can be recommended at this time. The 300-mg dose of rifabutin has been well tolerated. Adverse effects included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, rash, and gastrointestinal disturbances.  Treatment  Postinfection treatment involves a combination of antituberculosis antibiotics, including rifampicin, rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, ethambutol, streptomycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin. NTM infections are usually treated with a three-drug regimen of either clarithromycin or azithromycin, plus rifampicin and ethambutol. Treatment typically lasts at least 12 months. Although studies have not yet identified an optimal regimen or confirmed that any therapeutic regimen produces sustained clinical benefit for patients with disseminated MAC, the Task Force concluded that the available information indicated the need for treatment of disseminated MAC. The Public Health Service, therefore, recommends that regimens be based on the following principles: * Treatment regimens outside a clinical trial should include at least two agents. * Every regimen should contain either azithromycin or clarithromycin; many experts prefer ethambutol as a second drug. Many clinicians have added one or more of the following as second, third, or fourth agents: clofazimine, rifabutin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and in some situations amikacin. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide are not effective for the therapy of MAC. * Therapy should continue for the lifetime of the patient if the clinical and microbiologic improvement is observed. Clinical manifestations of disseminated MAC‚Äîsuch as fever, weight loss, and night sweats‚Äîshould be monitored several times during the initial weeks of therapy. The microbiologic response, as assessed by blood culture every 4 weeks during initial therapy, can also be helpful in interpreting the efficacy of a therapeutic regimen. Most patients who ultimately respond show substantial clinical improvement in the first 4‚Äì6 weeks of therapy. Elimination of the organism from blood cultures may take somewhat longer, often requiring 4‚Äì12 weeks. = HIV-infected children = HIV-infected children less than 12 years of age also develop disseminated MAC. Some age adjustment is necessary when clinicians interpret CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in children less than 2 years of age. Diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis should follow recommendations similar to those for adolescents and adults. Society and culture =Terminology= \\"Lady Windermere syndrome\\" is one term to describe infection in the lungs due to MAC. It is named after a character in Oscar Wilde's 1892 play Lady Windermere's Fan. In recent years, some have described the eponym as inappropriate, and some have noted that it would have been unlikely that Lady Windermere had the condition to which her name was assigned. The more commonly used term is nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection, or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (NMI). There is no evidence that a person's reluctance to spit has any causal role in NTM infection, the chief reason for the term having been applied to older women presenting with the condition. Lady Windermere syndrome is a type of mycobacterial lung infection. = Literary reference = The original Chest article proposing the existence and pathophysiology of the Lady Windermere syndrome suggested the character Lady Windermere in Oscar Wilde's Victorian- era play Lady Windermere's Fan is a good example of the fastidious behavior believed to cause the syndrome. The article states: : We offer the term, Lady Windermere's Syndrome, from the Victorian-era play, Lady Windermere's Fan, to convey the fastidious behavior hypothesized: \\"How do you do, Lord Darlington. No, I can't shake hands with you. My hands are all wet with the roses.\\" Victorian women presumably believed \\"ladies don't spit,\\" and consequently might have been predisposed to develop lung infection. Shortly after the Lady Windermere syndrome was proposed, a librarian wrote a letter to the editor of Chest challenging the use of Lady Windermere as the eponymous ancestor of the proposed syndrome. In the play, Lady Windermere is a vivacious young woman, married only two years, who never coughs or displays any other signs of illness. While her avoidance of shaking hands might be interpreted as \\"fastidiousness\\", two alternative explanations may be just as probable: :1) Lady Windermere actually is in the midst of arranging flowers and consequently cannot properly greet her guest: ::[LADY WINDERMERE is at table R., arranging roses in a blue bowl.] :2) Lady Windermere wishes to discourage the flirtatious advances of her would-be suitor Lord Darlington and cites her wet hands as an excuse to keep him from touching her: ::LADY WINDERMERE. Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the Foreign Office. I am afraid you are going to annoy me again. . . . ::LORD DARLINGTON. [Takes chair and goes across L.C.] I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere. You must tell me what I did. [Sits down at table L.] ::LADY WINDERMERE. Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening.] The scholars highlight the literary malapropism, but some in the medical community have adopted the term regardless, and peer-reviewed medical journals still sometimes mention the Lady Windermere syndrome, although it is increasingly viewed as a limiting and sexist term for a serious bacterial infection.

A right-arm seam bowler and left-handed batsman, Broad began his professional career at Leicestershire; in 2008 he transferred to Nottinghamshire, the county of his birth and the team for which his father played. In August 2006 he was voted the Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year. In the fourth Test of the 2015 Ashes series Broad took career best figures of 8‚Äì15 in the Australian first innings as they were dismissed for just 60. This performance was named as Wisden's Men's Test spell of the decade. Broad was awarded the Man of the Match in the fifth Test of the 2009 Ashes series at the Oval, after figures of 5/37 in the afternoon session of the second day. On 30 July 2011, at the Nottingham Test match against India, he achieved a Test match hat-trick in the process gaining his then best Test figures of 6‚Äì46. As a batsman, he holds the second-highest ever Test score made by a number 9‚Äîhe made 169, his only century in first-class cricket, against Pakistan in August 2010. At the start of the summer in 2012 Broad, returning from injury, produced figures of 7 for 72 in a match haul of 11 wickets against the West Indies. He is England's second highest wicket taker in Test cricket. On the morning of the fifth and final day of the third Test of the 2020 series against the West Indies, Broad became the seventh bowler to take 500 wickets in Test cricket, after dismissing Kraigg Brathwaite. Broad was the fourth fast bowler, and second bowler for England after James Anderson, to reach the milestone, who achieved it against the same batsman. Early life Broad was born 12 weeks prematurely and his life was saved by a doctor called John, after whom he was (middle) named when he survived. Broad originally started his cricketing career as an opening batsman, following in the footsteps of his father, the former England opener and current ICC match referee Chris Broad. It was not until he was 17 and had a growth spurt that he started to consider being a fast bowler. Broad had been associated with Leicestershire since he was 8 years old, having represented them at Under-9 level, and played for Melton Mowbray club Egerton Park, which also produced England seamer Tim Munton. Broad played for Egerton Park from the ages of 9 to 19; in his final two seasons he opened the batting with fellow Leicestershire player Matthew Boyce and spearheaded the attack. He was awarded the Leicestershire Young Cricketers Batsman Award in 1996. Before he was 17, he also played field hockey as a goalkeeper, and had trialled with England national field hockey team. Education Broad was educated at Brooke Priory School and Oakham School, a co-educational independent school in the market town of Oakham in Rutland, where he was in the same year as England Rugby back-row Tom Croft. Broad finished his school career with three B grades at A-level, and was given the choice of a place at Durham University or a contract with Leicestershire County Cricket Club. Domestic career Broad played his first game for Leicestershire 2nd XI in 2004 just before his 18th birthday and impressed enough to be given a full contract for the following season. Broad continued to impress Director of Cricket James Whitaker and made his first-class debut early in the 2005 season against Durham University Centre of Cricketing Excellence. He returned credible figures of 1/40 from 15 overs. His maiden first-class wicket was that of Nick Lamb. Broad followed this appearance with his first County Championship appearance against Somerset at the familiar location of Oakham. In the 2006 season Broad took his first 5 wicket haul against championship favourites Surrey and scored his first championship 50 against Derbyshire.

Overview  In a traditional superheterodyne radio receiver, most oscillator drift and instability occurs in the first frequency converter stage, because it is tunable and operating at a high frequency. In theory, if one can eliminate this drift, the receiver will be stable. Unlike other drift-reducing techniques (such as crystal control or frequency synthesis), the Wadley Loop does not attempt to stabilize the oscillator. Instead, it cancels the drift mathematically.  Principles of operation  Oscillator drift cancellation circuit - Wadley loop. The Wadley loop works by: # combining the first oscillator with the received signal in a frequency mixer to translate it to an intermediate frequency that is above the receiver's tuning range, # mixing the same oscillator with a comb of harmonics from a crystal oscillator, # selecting one of the results of (2) with a band-pass filter, and # mixing this with the IF signal from (1). Since the high-IF of part 1 drifts in the same direction, and the same amount, as the \\"synthetic oscillator\\" of part 3, when they are mixed in part 4 the drift terms cancel out and the result is a crystal-stable signal at a second intermediate frequency. But the drift makes it impossible to use high-IF selectivity to reject undesired signals. Instead, the high IF is designed with a bandpass characteristic. Also, since the first oscillator is cancelled out, it cannot be used to tune a particular signal. Instead, it selects an entire band of signals - which one depends on which harmonic was chosen in part 3 above. The size of the band is equal to the spacing of the crystal harmonics. A conventionally tuned \\"back end\\" selects the desired signal from the band of signals presented at the second IF.  Example  Let say we want to pick up signals from 0 to 30 MHz. This is divided into 30 1 MHz bands, which are then translated to a band at 44-45 MHz. To convert 0-1 MHz, the first oscillator must be 45 MHz, to convert 1-2 MHz it must be 46 MHz, and so on. Meanwhile, the first oscillator is also mixed with harmonics from a 1 MHz crystal and put the result through a 42 MHz filter. Only one harmonic gets through. When the first oscillator is 45 MHz, it is the third harmonic, because 45 - 3 = 42. At 46 MHz, it is the fourth harmonic, and so on. The oscillator does not have to be exactly 45, 46, and so on, only close enough to get through the 42 MHz bandpass filter. Let's say it is 45.1 . Then we get 42.1 from the filter, and 45.1 - 42.1 is still 3. When the high IF is mixed with the 42 MHz, the result is a band of signals from 3 MHz to 2 MHz, from which the desired signal is selected, perhaps with a conventional superheterodyne back-end converting 3-2 MHz to 455 kHz and finally demodulating the signal back to audio. The overall receiver drift consists of the crystal's drift plus the 3 MHz back-end, so when we're listening to a 30 MHz signal, this receiver is about ten times as stable as one using a high- frequency tunable VFO. To a new user, the feel of the first oscillator tuning control is counterintuitive. Although the knob moves in a continuous, analog fashion, its effect on receiver operation is discrete, that is, the tuning advances in 1 MHz jumps. An example is Yaesu's FRG-7 communications receiver,Wadley Drift Cancelling Loop which uses the system to remove local oscillator drift. The Racal RA17 and Realistic DX-302 also used the Wadley Loop in their design. An optical implementation of a Wadley Loop has recently been proposed. This allows a compact relatively unstable laser to be used as a local oscillator, with the system stability being obtained from a master 'comb source' (usually a pulsed laser, such as a mode-locked laser), possibly common to many receivers within an exchange.https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-15-19891  Notes  Category:Radio electronics Category:South African inventions ","title":"Wadley loop"},{"id":"3937864","text":"Defense Depot Ogden was a U.S. military installation located in Ogden, Utah. It encompassed with its southwest corner located on 12th Street (1200 South) and Tomlinson Road (1200 West). Its eastern border is the old Utah Northern Railroad, now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. History Prior to the establishment of what was known as the Utah General Depot on September 15, 1941, the underlying land was used for pasture and farmland. The Defense Depot Ogden Utah (DDOU) was one of seven similar facilities located around the nation. The property entered the ownership of the United States Army, under the command of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), an agency of the Department of Defense (DOD). The DDOU was used as logistical supply and administrative support for military installations and other DOD and federal agencies. The mission included the receipt, storage, maintenance, inventory and issue of items that included food, clothing, textiles, packages, petroleum products, pesticides, pressurized gases and general medical, industrial, construction and electronic supplies. During World War II, the DDOU was also used as an internment camp for both German and Italian prisoners of war. The Depot had an Officers' Club that allowed Department of the Army civilian employees to enjoy the facility. A set of military houses between the front gate and the Officers' Club made it feel like a neighborhood. There was also an AAFES store, as well as clothing sales. The commander changed from one service to another with each change but the commander was always a pay grade O-6 colonel or captain. The DDOU was listed in the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC) of 1995. As a result, the base ceased its functions on September 30, 1997. Management of the facilities was then handed over to the Hill Air Force Base DLA, at which time the official name of the facility changed to Defense Depot Hill Utah (DDHU) Ogden Site. Business Depot Ogden As early as 1995, the City of Ogden appointed a committee to research the development of the DDHU. Much of this work was towards the conversion of the area into a commercial and industrial park. The Ogden Local Redevelopment Authority (OLRA) is charged with ensuring that the City of Ogden's DDOU Reuse Plan is properly implemented. The transfer of ownership was completed in 2003, giving the facility to Ogden City. After nearly ten years, and at the expense of $115 million, the DDOU/DDHU became the Business Depot Ogden (BDO). The transition from a former military installation to a commercial park involved many changes to the street layout and buildings. The local Ogden newspaper, the Ogden Standard-Examiner, moved into a remodeled administrative building in the northeastern side of the BDO, investing in a new and much larger printing press for the new facilities. Present The City of Ogden and Boyer Co. entered an agreement early in the conversion process that forced any and all profit from the BDO to be diverted directly into investments in the facilities. This has been instrumental in the continuing expansion and development of the BDO. In October 2006, this agreement will expire, giving Ogden City and Boyer Co. even shares of future profits. In 2004, $7 million in revenue was seen, with an expected increase in 2005. Several notable Federal facilities continue to operate in the BDO. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maintains a large facility on site as part of its local network of buildings in the Ogden area. The United States Army Reserve continues to operate in its facilities, and a Deployable Medical Systems (DEPMEDS) unit, responsible for the refurbishment and supply of medical units, operated until 2002, when it moved to Hill Air Force Base. Commercial facilities on site include, among others, Autoliv, Edge Products, Barnes Aerospace, Hersheys, Homedepot, Setpoint, Lofthouse Foods, ICON Fitness, Kenco Logistic Services, and the Standard Examiner. Two new buildings totaling and nearing completion have already been partially leased. New road and construction area for several industrial buildings along the park's western border, and a planned cross-dock warehouse will be built on a plot near the center of the park. Future The BDO is part of a larger plan to entice business to the Ogden area. As of 2005, there are already more employees in the BDO than there were when the facility was still operating as a defense depot. Both Ogden City and Weber County are investing heavily in the hopes that the BDO will be an important part of the health of the city and county for the next 50 years. Boyer Co. has plans for both commercial and retail offerings along the busy 12th street border. This should include everything from restaurants to office buildings. Environmental impact Due to soil and groundwater contamination at the site, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated DDOU as a Superfund site and placed it on the National Priorities List in 1987. Site cleanup activities began in 1989 and continued through the 1990s. Groundwater and soil monitoring continues at the site. The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) conducted a public health assessment of the site and concluded in 1992 that DDOU poses \\"no apparent public health hazard.\\" Included in the site history was the storage of 2,328, 55-gallon drums of hazardous waste in 1993. This was part of a RCRA permit issued by the Utah Solid and Hazardous Waste Control Board. These drums were stored in a facility called the Conforming Storage Building. Storage of these materials ended in 1997, and the building was closed. As part of the transfer of ownership to the OLRA, two Finding of Suitability to Transfer (FOST) documents were developed and approved by state and federal agencies. A total of of uncontaminated ground were transferred to the OLRA. Further FOST activities are ongoing, and should eventually result in a nearly complete transfer of properties.

It is home to the Cesvaine Palace, built in 1896 near the ruins of previous medieval castles. History During the period before the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century, the territory of modern Cesvaine was part of the Principality of Jersika and was inhabited by ancient Latgalians. It was first mentioned in written sources in 1209 (Latin: Urbs Zcessowe) in the treaty between bishop Albert of Riga and Visvaldis of Jersika. In 1211 the Bishopric of Riga and the Livonian Brothers of Sword partitioned the lands of Jersika between themselves. The territory of Cesvaine fell under the control of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, however in 1213 some of the lands were exchanged and Cesvaine became property of the Bishop of Riga. In the beginning of the 15th century, a stone castle was built in Cesvaine and the settlement started to grow. By the end of the 16th century there were already 80 houses in Cesvaine. During the Livonian War in 1577, defenders of Cesvaine castle refused to surrender. Consequently, the Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible ordered that the castle and whole town be destroyed. After the war in 1582 Cesvaine became part of Duchy of Livonia. In 1656 during the Second Northern War Russians again seized the castle and destroyed the town. A new period in the history of Cesvaine started in the year 1815 when the settlement and nearby lands were bought by the baron von Wulf. Cesvaine became centre of the manor and rapid development started in the second half of the 19th century. In 1932 Cesvaine became a village in the Republic of Latvia. It was granted town rights in 1991. Since 2009, the town has become the official administrative centre of Cesvaine municipality.

Biography On Leatham's twelfth birthday, he received his first gun. His family surprised him with a new Smith & Wesson Model 34 revolver on one of their trips to shoot in the desert. He continued desert shooting throughout his teenage years and became involved in other sports such as basketball. =Competition shooting= Leatham's first competition took place in the late 1970s at a night shoot at the Mesa Police Department range. He shot a Smith & Wesson Model 27 revolver with a 6-inch barrel loaded with 200-grain round-nose bullets that Leatham loaded himself, including a custom holster made by local leather worker, Jess Bird, who had built holsters for Leatham's father for years. Leatham finished third revolver behind Mike Henry and Charlie Mills and cites this competition for causing his addiction to competitive shooting. He invented the Modern Isosceles shooting stance in the 1980s. A few years later he began shooting the 9x25 dillon handgun round and brought that cartridge into the mainstream. Leatham first shot the Steel Challenge and The Bianchi Cup in 1982. In 1985, he won the Triple Crown of practical pistol shooting: the IPSC US Nationals, the Bianchi Cup and the Steel Challenge. He is the only competitor to ever win all three matches in the same year. In 1989, he was offered a major contract with Springfield Armory, Inc. that enabled him to become a full-time, professional shooter. Since that time, Leatham has been practicing, competing, and conducting live-fire demonstrations for sponsors around the world. = Personal life = Leatham married fellow Team Springfield member Kippi Boykin, a three-time USPSA National Champion.

Preferred habitat includes stony deserts, shrubland, woodland, grassland and open plains.Van Dyck, S., Strahan, R., 2008. The mammals of Australia / edited by Steve van Dyck and Ronald Strahan. The kultarr has a range of adaptations to help cope with Australia's harsh arid environment including torpor similar to hibernation that helps conserve energy. The species has declined across its former range since European settlement due to changes in land management practices and introduced predators.Menkhorst, P., 2004. A field guide to the mammals of Australia / Peter Menkhorst, Frank Knight. Description The kultarr is a small carnivorous marsupial of the family Dasyuridae with unique morphological features. It is nocturnal, hunting a variety of invertebrates including spiders, crickets and cockroaches. During the day it shelters in a burrows in hollow logs, beneath grass tussocks, at the base of shrubs and trees or cracks in the soil. Males weigh between 17-30 grams and 80‚Äì100 mm in length. Females are slightly smaller between 14‚Äì29 grams and 70‚Äì95 mm in length. They have a brown or fawn-sandy color, with a white underside. The kultarr has a long tail with a distinctive dark brush- like tip. The muzzle is sharply pointed and the eyes and ears are particularly large; the eyes have dark rings around them. It has distinguishing elongated hind legs having four toes similar to macropodids. The hind legs are designed for a bipedal or hopping style movement,Troughton, E., 1973.

Kultarrs have been recorded moving at speeds of 13.8 km/h in open country. Taxonomy The kultarr is the sole member of the genus Antechinomys of the family Dasyuridae. Originally collected by Sir Thomas Mitchell in New South Wales, it was subsequently described as Phascogale lanigera by John Gould in 1856. Original illustration of Antechinomys laniger by John Gould 1863It was then moved into its own genus, Antechinomys, by Krefft in 1867 and in 1888 the species was formally named Antechinomys laniger.NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, 2002. Kultarr (Antechinomys laniger) Recovery Plan.Office of environment and heritage, 2012. Kultarr - profile  NSW Environment & Heritage [WWW Document]. URL http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10057 (accessed 8.30.15). In 1906 a second species of Antechinomys was described from specimens collected from an expedition to central Australia, classified as Antechinomys spenceri. Extensive discussion regarding the taxonomy of the genus followed. In 1981 it was proposed that Antechinomys was not distinct enough from Sminthopsis; subsequent isozyme and mitochondrial analysis proved the theory to be incorrect. A. laniger laniger and A. laniger spenceri are now accepted as being subspecies with minor morphological differences, both occurring in different geographic ranges. A. laniger laniger occurs in eastern Australia while A. laniger spenceri is found in western and central Australia. Morphological differences include A. laniger spenceri being paler in colour and heavier compared to A. laniger laniger. Distribution The kultarr occurs across a vast area of semi-arid and arid Australia but has since declined from parts of its former range and is now uncommon with populations suffering seasonal fluctuations. The kultarr has disappeared from Victoria and southern New South Wales at the Murray-Darling junction. Populations in south- east South Australia, Cedar Bay in north Queensland and western Queensland have also disappeared. Populations in the Northern Territory and Western Australia appear to be stable. Kultarr populations around Cobar in western New South Wales continue to persist, being regionally important for conservation of the species. Recent sightings of kultarrs occurred in 2015 at Nombinnie Nature Reserve in Central Western NSW. These sightings are significant as the species has not been sighted in the area for over 20 years.Heritage, corporateName=Office of E. and, 2015. Mystery Marsupial spotted at Nombinnie Nature Reserve [WWW Document]. URL http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/OEHMedia15071401.htm (accessed 8.29.15). Ecology and behavior Semi-arid woodlands =Life cycle and reproduction= The lifespan of kultarrs in the wild is unknown however in captivity they can live up to 5 years. The kultarr has distinct geographical variations in breeding seasons. Breeding and the onset of estrus occurs in the second half of the year in eastern populations with western populations occurring slightly later. Males are sexually mature at 9‚Äì10 months and females at 11‚Äì12 months. Female are polyestrous, having the ability to enter estrus multiple times in a breeding season. The kultarr has a crescent shaped pouch consisting of small folds of skin with six to eight teats. The young are carried in the pouch for up to 20 days, after this they hold on to the mothers back whilst she forages or are left in the burrow. Hummock grassland Both subspecies have different numbers of teats with A. laniger laniger having eight and A. laniger spenceri having six. This can be used to differentiate between the two subspecies. Captive breeding and rearing of kultarr is problematic and difficult. =Home range and movement= Gibber plains Australian plague locust Chortoicetes terminifera (CSIRO) Kultarrs migrate between different locations throughout the year, meaning local populations numbers can vary depending on seasonal fluctuations. Populations can decline in response to good rain with kultarrs preferring drier seasons. Movements and home ranges of kultarrs vary with movements of up to 1,700 m per night for males and 400 m per night for females. Kultarrs disperse and negotiate a variety of different habitat types to forage from vegetated areas and open bare ground. =Diet= The kultarr is predominantly insectivorous, its diet consisting largely of species including spiders, cockroaches, crickets and beetles. Additionally, kultarrs are also known to predate on other species of dasyurids. =Habitat= The kultarr occupies a range of different habitats preferring sparsely vegetated areas. Habitats include claypans, gibber plains, stony deserts, savannas, hummock (Triodia sp.) and tussock grasslands, woodlands and shrublands. Regional variation in habitat preference occurs with the western subspecies preferring stony, granite plains dominated by Acacia, Eremophila, and Cassia species. Eastern subspecies prefer sparsely vegetated clay pans in acacia woodlands. =Torpor as an adaptation= The kultarr is an Endotherm having a high metabolic rate, to conserve energy the kultarr enters into a state of torpor where the body temperature is reduced similar to hibernation. The body temperature drops to 11 ¬∞C reducing the metabolic rate by 30% conserving energy and reducing water loss. Torpor occurs in the evening-early morning, lasting between 2‚Äì16 hours. Species that enter torpor are referred to as heterothermic endotherms. Other species of Dasyriuds in arid Australia use torpor and is an adaptation to combat limited resource availability. The benefits of torpor include having an extended lifetime; this is advantageous in the harsh arid environment enabling recovery of populations after stochastic weather events such as flooding or drought. Torpor is also used during the breeding season to ensure breeding success even during poor seasons. Threats to survival =Habitat degradation= Fox (Vulpes vulpes) Changes in land management practices since European settlement has resulted in catastrophic declines of terrestrial fauna species throughout arid Australia.Letnic, M., 2007. The impacts of pastoralism on the fauna of arid Australia 65‚Äì76. Habitat degradation occurs through overgrazing by introduced species such as rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries), and cattle (Bos taurus). Cattle can trample and destroy vegetation, damaging soil structure and reducing deep cracks that reduces nesting and shelter sites for the kultarr. Floods =Predation by cats and foxes= Kultarrs are threatened by introduced predators such feral cats (Felis catus) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Good rainfall results in ecosystem pulses in arid regions, allowing predators to increase their numbers, therefore predation on kultarrs increases. Kultarrs are also predated by native species such as native owls and snakes. However cats differ from native predators as they are recreational hunters and continue to prey on species even when prey numbers are low. Domesticated cats on cattle stations have also been reported as preying on kultarrs.Finlayson, H.H., 1961. On Central Australian Mammals: Part IV The Distribution and Status of Central Australian Species. Government Printer, South Africa.Nash, S., Ayers, D., Baggett, K., Wales, N.S., 1996. Threatened Species of Western New South Wales. NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. =Flooding= Wild fires (CSIRO) Populations of kultarrs experience significant decline due to the impacts of flooding, causing the mortality of individuals through drowning and flooding of burrows.Morris, K., Burbidge, A.A., Maxwell, S., Australia, W., Australia, W., 1996. The 1996 action plan for Australian marsupials and monotremes. Wildlife Australia. The impact is exacerbated if kultarr populations are isolated, hindering re-colonisation. The destruction kultarr habitat is also a consequence of severe flooding. =Fire= The cessation of indigenous fire-stick farming and the reduction of patch-mosaic burning in arid Australia since European colonisation have caused increased severity of large-scale wildfires. Contributing to the decline of suitable habitat and refuges for the kultarr including tree hollows, fallen logs, Triodia spp. hummocks, shrubs and leaf litter. =Insecticides used to control locusts= Insecticide control of the Australian plague locust has been attributed to possible fatalities of species of Dasyriuds from secondary poisoning. Kultarrs are particularly susceptible because of their high insect diet, high metabolism and small body size. Once locusts are affected by insecticide kultarrs are able to capture and gorge-feed on them easily making them susceptible to poisoning. Conservation and management =Current status= The kultarr is classified as endangered in New South Wales under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and near threatened in the Northern Territory under the Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000.Northern Territory Government, 2013. Native Animals - Dept of Land Resource Management [WWW Document]. URL http://www.lrm.nt.gov.au/plants-and- animals/native-animals (accessed 8.30.15).

Kultarr ‚Äì Antechinomys laniger [WWW Document]. URL http://wetlandinfo.ehp.qld.gov.au/wetlands/ecology/components/species/?antechinomys- laniger (accessed 8.30.15) The kultarr is not classified in South Australia, Victoria or Western Australia. The kultarr is not listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and listed as least concern on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ‚Äòred list‚Äô of threatened species. = Targeted conservation programs = Fauna monitoring A detailed recovery plan has been developed for the kultarr by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service under the ‚Äòsaving our species‚Äô program. Objectives include identifying species distributions and habitat requirements, identifying specific threats to the species, implementing direct management strategies to reduce threats as well as public education to increase the profile of the kultarr. At present there aren't any plans to reintroduce kultarrs into the wild. Direct management strategies that benefit the species include: * Fox, rabbit and feral cat control programs * Maintaining patch mosaic burning in the landscape * Reducing the stocking rates of livestock on properties and excluding cattle from important kultarr habitat * Retention of understory and groundcover plants as well as other elements such as logs and leaf litter * Reporting any new sighting of the species.

It was produced by Britain's Amicus Productions and directed by Kevin Connor. Like Connor's other two Burroughs-derived films, The Land That Time Forgot and At the Earth's Core, the film was distributed in the United States by American International Pictures. The film is a direct sequel to The Land That Time Forgot, which initiated the series in 1975. The story follows a rescue expedition, led by Patrick Wayne in search of his friend, played by Doug McClure, who had vanished many years before. The expedition lands on Caprona, the same fantastic prehistoric land where dinosaurs and barbarian tribes of men co-exist. Plot Major Ben McBride (Patrick Wayne) organises a mission to the Antarctic wastes to search for his friend Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) who has been missing in the region for several years. A British naval survey ship takes them to Caprona. McBride's party: the paleontologist Norfolk (Thorley Walters), gunner and mechanic Hogan (Shane Rimmer) and photographer Lady Charlotte 'Charlie' Cunningham (Sarah Douglas) fly over the mountain wall of Caprona in an amphibious aircraft, but are attacked by a fierce giant pterodactylus and forced down. They find themselves in a world populated by primitive warriors and terrific and dreadful prehistoric creatures, all of whom they must evade in order to get back safely to their ship. They meet a cave-girl, Ajor (Dana Gillespie), who can speak English (she was taught by Tyler); she leads them to the land of a race of samurai-like warriors called the Nargas, who are keeping Tyler prisoner. When the volcano that the Nargas worship erupts, they must escape the cataclysm engulfing the land. Tyler sacrifices himself to cover their retreat.

Although the film was made by Amicus Productions, the company folded before it was released, meaning AIP took sole credit.Ed.

Rugby and Cricket Career James Averis built a reputation as a solid one- day performer, and in 2001 was able to make a major breakthrough into the Championship side. A stocky, powerful seam bowler, he was the club's highest wicket-taker in the National League and Championship that year. One of several graduates in the Gloucestershire squad, Averis gained a prestigious reputation as a sportsman at Oxford. He was awarded Blues in cricket and rugby, and represented Bristol Rugby Club (making his 1st XV debut in 1994, kicking 5 penalties out of 5 against Exeter) and Harlequins before settling on cricket in 2000. Bristol-born, he found himself thrown into the one-day side at the peak of its success at the turn of the century as the side won 8 trophies in 6 years. He claimed 29 National League victims in 2000, and continued performing very well in a less successful team performance in 2001. He also managed to hold his nerve in tense moments of the cup competitions, including the C&G; final of 2004, where he claimed 4-23 including a hat trick. His pace was a fairly constant 80+ mph, though he developed an excellent slower ball with the help of former team-mate Ian Harvey. He relied on accuracy and late movement, as well as the surprise slower ball and yorker, to claim most of his victims. An invaluable member of the one day side, he was a reliable fielder and decent lower order batter, who looked as though he genuinely enjoyed his cricket.

They are often called false antechinuses, although this genus includes the sandstone dibbler, which was previously assigned to a different genus. The species of this genus are as follows: * Sandstone dibbler, Pseudantechinus bilarni * Fat- tailed false antechinus, Pseudantechinus macdonnellensis * Alexandria false antechinus, Pseudantechinus mimulus * Ningbing false antechinus, Pseudantechinus ningbing * Rory Cooper's false antechinus, Pseudantechinus roryi * Woolley's false antechinus, Pseudantechinus woolleyae Pseudantechinus macdonellensis =Taxonomy= Scientific Name: Pseudantechinus macdonellensis Common Name: English-Fat-tailed-Antechinus, Fat-tailed Pseudantechinus =Habitat and Geographic Range= The P. macdonellensis is commonly found in the rocky environments of Central Australia.http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file;_id=AM05227.pdf =General Facts= A P. macdonellensis is a medium-sized dasyurid marsupial that ranges from 18-33 grams, and has a life span of about seven years.http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file;_id=AM05227.pdf It is presumed to have a large population, and generally lives within the confines of protected areas. Therefore, it is unlikely to decline at the rate needed to be listed as an endangered species. =Diet= The P. macdonellensis is generally an insectivore whose diet consists of beetles, grasshoppers, and termites. A characteristic specific to this kind of species is its ability to store fat in its tail when food is plentiful. =Torpor= In the winter most free ranging P. macdonellensis go into a state of torpor after midnight within the confines of rock crevices, and stay there until day breaks. In the morning, while they are still torpid, they move from the rock-crevices to basking sites exposed to the sun. Subsequently, this type of basking continues for the rest of the day. It appears that daily torpor is done in order to reduce the amount of daily metabolic expenditure by about 30%, and allows the species to live and reproduce in a challenging environment. It has also been observed that the species goes into a state of torpor at air temperatures ranging from -1 ¬∞C to 36 ¬∞C, and often occurs under circumstances in which the species finds itself under acute energetic stress. =Gestation= Males and females of the subdivision P. macdonellensis reach sexual maturity at about 350 days of age. A single gestation period takes about 43 days in the females, and produces a single litter of about six. The interval in between gestation periods is about 365 days. Pseudantechinus mimulus =Taxonomy= Scientific Name: Pseudantechinus mimulus Common Name: Alexandria False Antechinus, Carpentaria Pseudantechinus =Habitat and Geographic Range= The P. mimulus is endemic to Australia. More specifically they are restricted to Sir Edward Pellew Group (Northern Territory), Centre and Southwest Islands, and two locations near Queensland. In the 1988 census of the territories the species was found in the Centre and South West Islands, but in the 2003 census it was not located. It is believed that the P. mimulus stile resides within that area, but is yet to be confirmed. In addition, the habitat in which the species resides in is a rocky one with scattered trees and wood. =General= The P. mimulus is classified as an endangered species. Its endangerment is due to the decline in habitat quality and extent as a result of fire, introduced predators, and mining. =Diet= While a lot of details about the species diet is unknown, it is believed that they eat mostly invertebrates as well as some small vertebrates.

The station also carries games for the Cleveland Indians, and Youngstown State Penguin football and basketball. History The station was founded in 1926 by Warren P. Williamson, Jr. (1900‚Äì1996). It is Youngstown's oldest continuing operating radio station, signing on the air on September 26, 1926 at 1400 kHz at 50 watts. The original facilities were in the basement of Williamson's home, but by the following year operations had moved to studios in the YMCA in downtown Youngstown. Ownership was organized in the name of the Radio Electric Service Co., and later WKBN Broadcasting Corporation. With the implementation of the FRC's General Order 40 on November 11, 1928 the station moved 570 kHz where it remains today. Shortly after WKBN's launch, the station became a charter affiliate of the nascent CBS Radio Network, an affiliation that would last until the end of the century. In the 1930s and 1940s, WKBN established a major presence in Youngstown as the city's CBS network affiliate, and for many years it was one of only two radio stations licensed to Youngstown (the other being WFMJ, now WNIO, which signed on in 1939). On February 8, 1943, Alan Freed started his early radio career on WKBN. Most importantly was broadcasting on Radio Luxembourg to the troops abroad. Williamson started WKBN-FM in 1948, and for many years it transmitted the same programming as the AM station. The FM station is now WMXY. He also started WKBN-TV in 1953, which became a predominantly CBS-TV affiliate in part due to the AM station's long history with the radio network (WKBN-TV to this day has retained the CBS-TV affiliation). On January 22, 1999 the Williamsons sold WKBN and WKBN-FM to Jacor Communications, ending 73 years of family ownership. Jacor, however, did not own the stations very long. On April 29, 1999 Clear Channel Communications completed its $6.5 billion purchase of Jacor and its 454 stations, including WKBN and WKBN-FM.

Life He was born in Newtownstewart, County Tyrone, Ireland, the eldest son of Rev James Maclear and Mary Magrath. In 1808 he was sent to England to be educated in the medical profession. After passing his examinations, in 1815 he was accepted into the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He then worked as house-surgeon in the Bedford Infirmary. In 1823 he went into partnership with his uncle at Biggleswade, Bedfordshire. Two years later in 1825 he was married to Mary Pearse, the daughter of Theed Pearse, Clerk of the Peace for the county of Bedford. Maclear had a keen interest in amateur astronomy, and would begin a long association with the Royal Astronomical Society, to which he would be named a Fellow. In 1833, when the post became vacant, he was named as Her Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, and arrived there aboard the Tam O'Shanter with his wife and five daughters, to take up his new duties in 1834. He worked with John Herschel until 1838, performing a survey of the southern sky, and continued to perform important astronomical observations over several more decades. The Maclears and Herschels formed a close friendship, the wives drawn together by the unusual occupations of their husbands and the raising of their large families. Mary Maclear, like Margaret Herschel, was a noted beauty and intelligent, though suffering from extreme deafness. A memorial to the Abb√© de la Caille and Thomas Maclear, at Aurora, Western Cape, South Africa. The English portion of the inscription reads: \\"This is the site of the Maclear Beacon positioned in 1838 near the original North Terminal of the Arc of Meridian positioned by Abb√© de la Caille, the first surveyor to introduce Geodetic Surveying into South Africa.\\" In 1750, Abb√© Nicolas Louis de Lacaille had measured a triangulation meridian arc northwards from Cape Town, to determine the figure of the earth, and found that the curvature of the earth was less in southern latitudes than at corresponding northern ones. Sir George Everest visited the Cape in 1820 and visited the site of La Caille's measurements. From his experience in the Himalayas he believed that the presence of considerable mountain masses in the Cape could have caused false measurements to be made by La Caille. Between 1841 and 1848, Maclear would be occupied in performing a geodetic survey for the purpose of recalculating the figure of the Earth (its dimensions and shape). He caused a beacon to be erected on top of Table Mountain which was used as a triangulation station for the checking of de Lacaille's calculations. He became close friends with David Livingstone, and they shared a common interest in the exploration of Africa. He performed many other useful scientific activities, including collecting meteorological, magnetic and tide data. In 1861 his wife died. Two years later he was granted a pension, but did not retire from the observatory until 1870. He lived thereafter at Grey Villa, Mowbray. By 1876, he had lost his sight, and he died three years later in Cape Town, South Africa. He is buried next to his wife in the grounds of the Royal Observatory.

It premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. The film chronicles the 2002 defeat, and 2004 reelection, of Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney to the U.S. House of Representatives; it also discusses issues surrounding alleged voter disenfranchisement and the use of voting machines in both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Background The film focuses heavily on McKinney, and claims that her 2002 loss in a Democratic primary to Denise Majette (who, like McKinney, is African-American) was part of an effort to disenfranchise minority voters. McKinney claims that Republican voters in her district tipped the primary election to Majette. This itself is legal, as Georgia law opens primaries to all voters irrespective of party. After losing, McKinney filed a lawsuit claiming that open primaries are a violation of the 14th Amendment, but a court dismissed the case. The film also includes civil rights leader and U.S. Representative John Lewis with a powerful recounting of the march from Selma to Montgomery Alabama across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

The main office is located in Coudersport in Potter County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Susquehannock State Forest is located chiefly in Potter County, with small tracts in McKean and Clinton Counties. The forest is named for the Susquehannocks, a Native American tribe who once lived in the Susquehanna River basin. History Susquehannock State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. American conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and Iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The situation was exacerbated as often sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management--such as those measures which had been for some years making news in Europe and India. Knowledge of Forest management practices among the well informed, then being long in place in France and Germany added impetus to pay attention to the changes signaled by Great Britain's legislative actions. The American leaders across many states began calling for their state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies. In the day in Pennsylvania, the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since they had depleted the natural resources of the forests, more commercially valuable iron mines were providing ores, and selling the lands eliminated the annual need to pay property taxes. These demands of this movement were later recognized by sociologists and historians as one earmark of the Progressive Era in United States politics and social reorganization. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Hammersley Wild Area Hammersley Wild Area is a wild area in the Susquehannock State Forest in Potter and Clinton counties in north-central Pennsylvania in the United States. It is the largest area without a road in Pennsylvania and the state's second largest wild area (the first being Quehanna Wild Area).

Trogus Pompeius and Justin mention a rise in Dacian authority under the leadership of King Rubobostes (before 168 BCBarry Cunliffe (1987)142) which probably suggests the end of Celtic dominance in Transylvania, that is, that they were possibly thrust out of Dacia by the growing power of an indigenous dynasty.

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Gorna Oryahovitsa Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 32,436 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute ‚Äì towns in 2009 \\"WorldCityPopulation\\"\\"pop-stat.mashke.org\\" The nearby village of Arbanasi is an architectural reserve with many historical monuments, such as medieval churches and examples of the Bulgarian National Revival architecture.  History  View from the hill Kamaka = Early history = The first settlement in the area dates back to the second half of the 5th millennium BC (Middle Neolithic Age). There are traces of a later Thracian settlement between the Kamaka (The Stone) Hill and the Arbanasi Plateau. Its inhabitants were from the tribe of Krobizi. They erected the Kamaka Fortress that existed from the 5th century BC to the 1st century BC, when the Romans built up their own fortified settlement over its ruins. It gradually acquired economic power mainly through cultivating grapes and producing wine. The life of that settlement continued up to the coming of the Slavs (6th‚Äì7th century). There is no substantial evidence of settled life between the 7th and the 12th century. = Middle Ages = After the restoration of the Bulgarian State at the end of the 12th century, a need arose for protection of the new metropolis Tarnovgrad. Several fortresses were built, including Rahovets ( northwest of the modern town). The main purpose of the strongholds was to protect the roads leading to the Bulgarian capital Tarnovgrad. The name Rahovets means 'road fortress' (from Persian rah, meaning 'road'). The medieval fortress gave its name to the modern town, even though with some Slavic twist. They were well known for their mushroom farming at the time. This proved to be a good method of income for the town. Rachovets fortress ruins During the Ottoman invasion, the fortress was conquered by the Ottomans after its water pipeline was cut off (without destroying the fortress). Rahovets existed up to the year 1444 when King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Warne≈Ñczyk during his campaign against the Ottomans destroyed it. Three individual small villages existed during the first centuries of Ottoman rule there‚ÄîMala (Little), Sredna (Middle) and Golyama (Greater) Rahovitsa. It was known as \\"Yukarƒ± Rahova\\" (\\"Upper Rahovets\\" in Turkish) during Ottoman rule. = Development and growth = During the Bulgarian National Revival, Gorna Oryahovitsa gradually turned into an economically strong settlement. Crafts prospered and trade was among the most active in Northern Bulgaria. Every Friday there was a big market for cattle, agricultural production, timber, and charcoal. As early as 1822, a monastery school was opened here and in 1827 a private school that became public in 1835 began functioning. In 1850, the first girls' school opened gates and in 1859 the first intermediate high school was founded. A chitalishte (library and community centre) was opened in 1869. Gorna Oryahovitsa was proclaimed a town in 1870, when it numbered 4,700 inhabitants and had 1,200 houses and 5 churches. = Revolutionary struggles = The population of the town took part in the struggle for national liberation. Vasil Levski organised a revolutionary committee in Gorna Oryahovitsa during the first half of 1869 and later visited the town two more times. During the preparation of the April uprising Gorna Oryahovitsa was designated as a centre of the First Revolutionary District with Stefan Stambolov as Chief Apostle. After the failure of the April Uprising, Georgi Izmirliev \\"Makedoncheto\\" (the Macedonian), one of the local leaders, was hanged in the centre of Gorna Oryahovitsa. His last words were: \\"How good it is to die for the freedom of the Fatherland!\\" Three citizens of Gorna Oryahovitsa fought in Hristo Botev's detachment of armed volunteers and 132 people joined the Bulgarian volunteer forces during the Russo-Turkish War of Liberation. The Imperial Russian Army liberated Gorna Oryahovitsa from Ottoman rule on 26 June 1877. International Fair in Gorna Oryahovitsa = Liberated Bulgaria = After the Liberation, the town developed as a significant transport (predominantly railway) centre as it is nowadays. Its proximity with the old metropolitan town of Veliko Tarnovo, tourist centre Arbanasi, the monasteries around and a great number of other sites of interest makes it a known tourist destination.

Smith, The American International Pictures Video Guide, McFarland 2009 p 16 The film was directed by Kevin Connor and stars Doug McClure, Peter Cushing and Caroline Munro. It was filmed in Technicolor, and is based on the 1914 fantasy novel At the Earth's Core by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the first book of his Pellucidar series, in token of which the film is also known as Edgar Rice Burroughs' At the Earth's Core. The original music score was composed by Mike Vickers. Plot Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing), a British Victorian scientist, and his US financier David Innes (Doug McClure) make a test run of their Iron Mole drilling machine in a Welsh mountain, but end up in a strange underground labyrinth ruled by a species of giant telepathic flying reptiles, the Mahars, and full of prehistoric beasts and cavemen. They are captured by the Mahars, who keep primitive humans as their slaves through mind control. David falls for the beautiful slave girl Princess Dia (Caroline Munro) but when she is chosen as a sacrificial victim in the Mahar city, David and Perry must rally the surviving human slaves to rebel and not only save her but also win their freedom.

We had a somewhat bigger budget thanks to the success of ‚ÄòLand.‚Äô The beasts were specially designed so that small stunt guys could work inside the suits in a crouched position and on all-fours. Needless to say it was very cramped and the stunt guys had to take frequent breathers. Some worked better than others ‚Äì but we were experimenting and trying something different.\\" Reception The film was popular, becoming the 18th most profitable British film of 1976. Amongst contemporary critics, however, The New York Times was not impressed: \\"All the money used to make 'At the Earth's Core' seems to have been spent on building monsters with parrotlike beaks that open, close, and emit a steady squawling as if someone were vacuuming next door. Close up, the monsters look like sections of rough concrete wall and the decision to film them in closeup is only one example of the total lack of talent or effort with which the picture is made...the movie is a kind of no-talent competition in which the acting, the script, the direction and the camera-work vie for last place.\\" More recently, in more positive vein, BFI Screenonline said, \\"Extravagant, colourful and thoroughly preposterous, At the Earth's Core is utterly without pretension but has the exuberant charm of the best of its decade.\\" The film was featured in the season finale of the revived Mystery Science Theater 3000, the show's eleventh season overall, released on April 14, 2017 through Netflix.

Color guard teams can be found in American colleges, universities, high schools, middle schools and independent drum corps.https://www.dci.org/ They use various equipment including, flags, non-functioning rifles, and sabres, along with other props. Most Color Guard groups are of mixed gender but some may also be single gender. They perform using their equipment (flag, rifle, saber, prop, etc.), and emotional connections (facial expressions and dance and sometimes voice) to the audience to enhance the meaning and feeling of their show. Color guards perform with marching bands during football games at halftime. During marching band competitions, the guard adds to the overall score of the band and can be judged in many categories including but not limited to: visual effects, general effect, auxiliary, and color guard. Color guards have since evolved into a separate activity known as winter guard, which is an indoor sport usually performed during the winter or spring, where the guard performs unaccompanied by a marching band to a piece of pre-recorded music indoors. Winter guards compete independently in such circuits as Winter Guard International (WGI), Tournament Indoor Association (TIA), or Keystone Indoor Drill Association (KIDA). There is only one nationally recognized color sorority in the United States. Phi Rho Psi National Color Guard Sorority was founded in 2009 at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas.  History  A military color guard often traveled with a band, who would play patriotic songs. This way of performing continued into the civilian marching bands, and today a marching band's color guard is usually found carrying equipment descending from those of military color guard: flags, banners, wooden rifles, and plastic or metal sabres. Modern guards use real sabers as well, but without the sharpened point. One tradition that contributed to color guards in American marching bands is the Swiss art of flag swinging or Fahnenschwingen. The 1936 Olympian Franz Hug of Lucern, Switzerland, came to America and introduced flag swinging in 1937. Leonard Haug, an assistant band director at the University of Wisconsin, was intrigued. Haug created ten flags representing the schools of the Big Ten Conference. When Haug came to the University of Oklahoma the following year, he became the first to introduce the technique in the Southwest and formed a corps of Big Six Conference flag swingers for the Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band. The 1938 squad was all male, but the group was co-ed within two years. By 1940, O.U. flag swingers were participating at basketball games and creating innovative routines with two flags.The Bandsman. 12 December 1940. The OU color guard may be the oldest existing unit of its kind in American marching bands. As Director of the OU band, Haug wrote a training guide for flag swinging and an article for a swing flag brochure, assisting the spread of the trend to other marching bands. In 1965, Haug succeeded in combining the swing flag with a baton. It was an idea on which he had worked for years. He called his invention the \\"twirl-flag\\" baton. He wrote that it was \\"a truly American flag baton idea suitable for solo and corps exhibition.\\"Leonard Haug to Bob Barnard. undated letter. It was a 32\\" baton with a colored flag at each end that rotated around the shaft to prevent fouling. The invention was first featured by the University of Arkansas marching band at the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 1966, and later manufactured by Kraskin Batons of Minneapolis. Kraskin Batons, Inc. pamphlet. For all of Haug's efforts, however, the \\"twirl- flag\\" baton never caught on, but regular flags and batons remained standard for most marching bands. During the 1950s and 1960s, much of the impetus for the evolution of the modern color guard came from the arena of competitive drum and bugle corps. Pioneers from these corps traveled to other areas of the country to teach, introducing color guards to more traditional bands. In 1962, Vincent R. DiNino, Director of the Longhorn Band, \\"The Showband of the Southwest\\", at the University of Texas began the use big 4'x6' flags in the school colors (orange and white) as a group marching with the band at halftime shows at football games. Since flags of that type were not then available from any commercial vendors, his wife, Jane DiNino, sewed the flags. The flag poles were made of lightweight dowel wood purchased at a local lumber yard with flag holders purchased from a local army-navy surplus store. Movies of the Longhorn Band taken by the Athletic Department at the University of Texas captured the first use of big flags by a college marching band. Director DiNino charged a band member, Larry Cullison, with the duty of charting movements of the flags and working the flags into the performance of the band during halftime performances. By 1972, there were 16 big flags in use as a part of the Longhorn Marching Band at the University of Texas. The use of big flags spread throughout the Southwest Conference. The band directors at the University of Memphis (Memphis State), Dr. Tom Ferguson and Art Theil, recruited music major Sam Shaw to start one of the first collegiate color guards in the South, the \\"Bengal Lancers\\" in 1974. Director of Bands at Northwestern University, John Paynter, was also one of the first to add a color guard to the marching band when he hired Bugle Corp specialist George Parks in 1976. Consequently, color guards spread quickly throughout the country. The visual effect of spinning and shaking flags drew the attention of crowds and quickly caught on. Having visual impact for pieces played when the band stood still added a whole new dimension to the performance. By the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s color guards had been added to most Southwest Conference, Big Ten and Big 8 (Currently Big 12) bands. Once these prominent university bands had color guards, there was widespread inclusion of guards at high schools across the nation in the 1980s and 1990s. The popularity of color guard has grown such that winter guard has gained widespread membership and attention. Color guard was not always accepted among marching band organizations. As Arthur Williams stated in his 1958 book, The College and University Band, \\"If it actually made no difference to your high school or community whether or not you fronted your band with girl majorettes, baton twirlers, flag swingers, pompom girls, and so on, what would you prefer? Favor use of girl majorettes and so on: 52 percent. Prefer no use of girl majorettes and so on: 48 percent.\\" The University of Wisconsin, where Leonard Haug first introduced conference flags, has since discontinued the practice of having a color guard.  Marching band  The Valdosta High School Marching Band Color Guard at the 2015 Greater Valdosta Community Christmas Parade. In a marching band or a drum and bugle corps, the color guard is a non-musical section that provides additional visual aspects to the performance. The marching band and color guard performance generally takes place on a football field. The color guard performs alongside the marching band at football games and most guards regularly compete in competitions during the fall. The purpose of the color guard is to interpret the music that the marching band or drum and bugle corps is playing via the synchronized work of flags, sabers, rifles, the air blade, by dance, or by non-traditional equipment for example a trident if you were to do an Atlantis Show. The color guard uses different colors and styles of flags like swing flags and tapered flags to enhance the visual effect of the marching band as a whole. Color guard also may use backdrops to bring color and scenery to the field if the concept of the show is hard to interpret. The number of members in a color guard can range from a single person to over 50 members. This is often dependent on the size of the band, school or corps, the allotted budget, and the talent available among the potential members who try out. In drum and bugle corps, there used to be a requirement for a traditional presentation of the colors during the competitive show (called the \\"Color Pre\\"), but this fell out of favor around the early 1970s. High school marching bands kept it in until the late '70s. A recent example of a Color Pre in show was the 2002 San Francisco Renegades Sr corps, used during \\"America the Beautiful\\" to open their program, but such a presentation was not a required part of the show. There are many different types of spins and tosses that can be done with the flag. Each spin or toss creates a different illusion and can be used for different tempos. Basic color guard moves include Jazz runs (a Jazz dance move used as a graceful way to run across the marching band field or the gym floor), \\"right shoulder\\" (positioning the flag with the bottom of the pole by your belly button and your right hand by the flag's silk tape) and \\"stripping the flag\\" (holding the flag silk with your fingers so you won't reveal the color(s) of the flag.) Flag poles and silks both come in different sizes, and there are different shapes and textures for silks, as well. Flags frequently have weights -generally 1 in. carriage bolts or the like- in the bottom and top of the pole to make it easier to toss the flag into the air. However, even with the weights, weather conditions such as wind and rain can affect a flag's spin and disrupt a toss if not correctly taken into account.  Winter guard  Winter guard show at Center Grove High School in Greenwood, Indiana, 2012 Winter guard is similar to outdoor color guard (marched with a drum corps or marching band), except the performances are indoors on gymnasium floors through the winter season, and the marching band does not normally perform with the winterguard. The traditional marching band music heard during fall season is replaced with a recording of various musical genres, but sometimes the color guard will just find (a) song(s) to perform to. A common theme in many shows is loss or something that conveys great emotion. The gymnasium floor typically is covered by an individually designed tarp (called a floor mat or floor by members) that generally reflects the show being performed on it. Occasionally the floor only acts as a backdrop so that the audience is drawn towards what the members are doing. The members may perform barefoot, but wearing jazz shoes or modern dance shoes is also common. WGI frequently partners with companies that provide services and products to competing groups, as well as leading educators in other fields to highlight the activity. The organization is promoted using the tagline \\"Sport of the Arts\\". There are different types of membership fees that must be paid in order to be a part of WGI, or winter guard (or color guard) in general. Possible scholarships are given out to hardworking performers. There are several winter guard circuits for participating in competitions during the indoor season, including TIA (Tournament Indoor Association), MAIN (Mid-Atlantic Indoor Network), AIA (Atlantic Indoor Association), WGI (Winter Guard International), and many more. = Winter Guard International = Winter Guard International (WGI), known as WGI \\"Sport of the Arts\\", in which teams of highly skilled individuals work to create and perform complex sequences of dance, music, and use of special equipment, such as sabres, rifles, and flags, to compete by division. This organization refers to winter guard as the \\"Sport of the Arts\\" due to the equally athletic and artistic nature of the activity. Co-founded in 1977 by six people, the goal of WGI was to organize and standardize the activity by creating skill levels, scoring systems, venues, and competitions. Today, groups participating in a WGI event are placed into one of eight categories; Middle School, Regional A, Scholastic A, Independent A, Scholastic Open, Independent Open, Scholastic World, or Independent World. WGI hosts many regional competitions which lead up to the World Championships, a three-day event in which hundreds of winter guard groups come together to compete. WGI Championships is held in Dayton, Ohio. = Adjudication = The judging community is a body of professionals who are working to perpetuate the unique experience WGI Sport of the Arts offers. Many are professionally trained in music, dance and theatre and use that knowledge to enhance the performances through one on one critique meetings after performances. Judges applying for WGI approval must complete a home study process, the Judges' Academy, trialing on guards in every class mentioned above, and participate in a continuing education program that encompasses annual study requirements and clinics. WGI judges are knowledgeable of what is expected from each of the above-mentioned classes.

Initially, Freeman was classically trained. His reputation as a jazz pianist grew in the 1940s after working with Art Pepper and Shorty Rogers. He played with Charlie Parker on the 1947 \\"Home Cooking\\" jazz session. Numerous collaborations followed in the 1950s with Chet Baker, Shelly Manne, and Art Pepper. These collaborations included the Jazz Immortal CD recorded with Russ Freeman and jazz trumpeter Clifford Brown in 1954, which included leading musicians Brown and Zoot Sims. On the Jazz Immortal CD, Russ Freeman was able to play in a combo that recorded many Clifford Brown compositions. In 1957, he collaborated with Andr√© Previn on the album Double Play!, where they both played piano, accompanied only by Manne on drums. In 1988, Keith Jarrett performed a version of Freeman's \\"The Wind\\" in a solo concert in Paris, which is featured on his album Paris Concert. In 1991, Mariah Carey wrote her own lyrics to \\"The Wind\\" for her album Emotions. Freeman had written \\"The Wind\\" with original lyrics by Jerry Gladstone; it had been performed as an instrumental piece during the 1950s and 1960s by the likes of Baker, Leo Wright, and Stan Getz, and had been sung by vocalist June Christy (on The Misty Miss Christy). Freeman's piano is featured on Baker's 1954 recording of \\"The Wind\\" (featured on Chet Baker & Strings). Freeman remained busy in music throughout his life, transitioning from jazz pianist to film scoring and composition before his death in Las Vegas in 2002. Freeman was married three times, and he had one daughter, Paula Kenley Freeman, from his second marriage. He had no grandchildren. His daughter moved from Seattle to live in the Netherlands in 2009, and an interview about her relationship with her father appeared in the May 2009 issue of the European magazine, PianoWereld.

Only sporadic issues were made, which circulated alongside United States currency. Coins The first official coinage issued by the Kingdom of Hawai'i was in 1847. This coin was a copper cent bearing the portrait of King Kamehameha III on its obverse. The King Kamehameha III copper cent proved to be unpopular due to the King's portrait being of poor quality. Although it is claimed the denomination was misspelled (hapa haneri instead of hapa haneli), the spelling \\"Hapa Haneri\\" was correct until the end the 19th century. The spelling \\"Haneri\\" (Hawaiian for \\"Hundred\\") appears on all $100 and $500 Hawaiian bank notes in circulation between 1879 and 1900. In 1883, Kingdom of Hawai'i official silver coinage were issued in the denominations of one dime (umi keneta in Hawaiian), quarter dollar (hapaha), half dollar (hapalua) and one dollar (akahi dala). 26 proof sets were struck by the Philadelphia Mint and contained the umi keneta, hapaha, hapalua, and akahi dala. 20 proof specimens in the denomination of an eight dollar (hapawalu) were also struck.

The silver coins issued for circulation in the Kingdom was struck by the San Francisco Mint Hawaiian coins continued to circulate for several years after the 1898 annexation to the United States. In 1903, an act of Congress demonetized Hawaiian coins, and most were withdrawn and melted, with a sizable percentage of surviving examples made into jewelry.

However, these notes were issued only in small numbers and US notes made up the bulk of circulating paper money. From 1884, only US gold coins were legal tender for amounts over $10. In 1897, the Republic of Hawaii issued silver coin deposit certificates for $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. In 1899, banknotes backed by gold deposits were issued in the same denominations.

Previous generations of Lawrences had settled in the American colonies but returned to England after the War of Independence. Lawrence was an educated and refined man, an intimate of Jeremy Bentham, who was obliged to migrate to the colony of Van Diemen‚Äôs Land due to poor health. On his leaving England Bentham wrote to a friend in Rio de Janeiro: ‚ÄòOur excellent friend on his way to Australia is not without thoughts of touching at Rio de Janeiro: a worthier man, a more benevolent cosmopolite, never left any country; and very few better informed or more intelligent‚Äô. He purchased a small cutter, the Lord Liverpool and sailed via South America in 1822. On the way he sailed into Rio de Janeiro for provisions and water. Brazil, a Portuguese colony since the 16th century, was in the midst of a struggle for independence, and Lawrence became personally involved through his friendship with Jos√© Bonif√°cio, the liberal revolutionary and first minister under the new government of Dom Pedro, who had defied his father in Lisbon and declared Brazil independent in 1822. Lawrence was captivated by events and remained for months in the country, becoming a confidant of Jos√© Bonif√°cio, the architect of Brazilian independence. Bonif√°cio wanted Lawrence to remain in the country permanently, but Lawrence declined, and after several exciting months, sailed on for Van Diemen‚Äôs Land. Lawrence arrived in 1823 and, by order of the Colonial Office was ordered a grant of 4,000 acres (16 km¬≤) with his brother, with a reserve after 5 years of a further 4,000 acres (16 km¬≤). These 8,000 acres (32 km¬≤) of land became the subject of controversy, because the grant was to be exclusive of waste land. In the end, due to the mismanagement of the surveyor general, the grant ended up being some 12,000 acres (49 km¬≤). The colony was small and gossip, jealousy and petty rivalry was rife. When Colonel George Arthur arrived he was informed of the size of the grant, and ordered an inquiry, sending John Helder Wedge to survey the grant. Wedge and Lawrence became friends and Wedge‚Äôs niece Anne Wedge married Lawrence‚Äôs son Robert William Lawrence in 1832. Lawrence‚Äôs pastoral interests continued throughout the next 20 years and he eventually became one of the largest landowners in the colony. Lawrence was also prominent in the field of education, helping establish a school in the Norfolk Plains, which was not a success. He then formed a committee with Henty and Mulgrave for the formation of a Church of England school in Launceston, but died before the foundation of Launceston Church of England Grammar School. Under Governor Sir John Franklin Lawrence was appointed to the Legislative Council and retained his seat until his death in 1841. Of his sons Robert William Lawrence died young in 1833, and the others remained in the colonies, except for Edward Effingham Lawrence, who returned to England to be educated and became a Cornet in the 7th Dragoon Guards in 1856 and taking part in the Austro-Sardinian War (1860‚Äì61).

Example Most famously Algerian refugee Ahmed Zaoui was incarcerated in a maximum security prison in solitary confinement on the strength of a report produced by the threat assessment unit of the Police. On 20 March 2003 a Security Risk Certificate was issued by the Director of Security under Part 4A of the Immigration Act (Zaoui v Attorney-General, unreported, McGrath, Hammond and O‚ÄôRegan JJ, Court of Appeal, 17 September 2004, CA166/04, paragraph 5) that allows for ‚Äúpersons .... who pose a security risk ‚Ä¶ where necessary [to] be effectively and quickly detained and removed or deported from New Zealand‚Äù (s 114A(f)) on the basis of classified security information provided by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service. Designation of an entity A comparable procedure to the current system for review of a Security Risk Certificate is that provided for the designation of an entity as a terrorist entity or an associated entity of a terrorist by the Prime Minister under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 (ss 20, 22). Under s 38 a marked departure occurs from New Zealand's open justice and adversarial process in procedures relating to such applications to challenge or to appeal such designation. The Chief Justice or nominee, on request by the Attorney- General, if satisfied that it is desirable to do so for the protection of the classified information received or hear the classified security information in the absence of the designated entity, and all barristers and solicitors representing that entity, and all members of the public (s 38(3)(b)). A summary of the information, excluding any summary of information that will itself likely to prejudice the interests set out in s 32(3), is then approved by the Court (s 38(4)(a)). A copy of that would then be given to the entity concerned (s 38(4)(b)). Section 32(3) is denied if the disclosure would be likely: * To prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand, or the international relations of the Government of New Zealand (s 32(3)(a)); or * To prejudice the entrusting of information to the Government ‚Ä¶ by the Government of another country or international organization (s 32(3)(b)); or * To prejudice making of law including the prevention, investigation and detection of offences and the right to a fair trial (s 32(3)(c)); or * To endanger the safety of any person (s 32(3)(d)). While the specific offences of terrorist bombing and financing of terrorism offences do not rely on the designation of entities, the other prohibition offences do, unless the prosecution can rely upon knowledge/recklessness of the group carrying out a terrorist act. The other offence (relating to dealings with terrorists) is also affected by extraterritorial jurisdiction either as to the Actus reus or to some aspect of connection with the offence or offenders. Classified information The procedures for dealing with classified information with respect to the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 is slightly more open than that which governs Security Risk Certificates under the Immigration Act 1987, in that there is a presumption that a summary of information will be made available to the applicant. The counsel are ordinary defence counsel, and lack access to the classified material.

This idea was both innovative and controversial for its time, as toy dolls were traditionally associated with younger girls. Hasbro also introduced a companion Kid Sister marketed toward girls. Hasbro discontinued the line before the start of the 1990s and Playskool took over production, making changes to the likeness and clothing. My Buddy is one of several dolls said to be the inspiration for Chucky, the evil doll from Child's Play. Hasbro During its initial run, My Buddy had the following characteristics: *red baseball cap *brown hair *red/yellow/blue/white striped long-sleeved shirt *red overalls with \\"My Buddy\\" logo on chest * white socks *blue shoes with white stripe *the whole doll (besides head) was stuffed fabric. *face had blue or brown eyes, freckles, \\"button\\" nose, and smile Two versions of the dolls existed: the brown-haired version described above, and a blond version: *blue baseball cap *blond hair *red/yellow/blue/white striped long-sleeved shirt *blue overalls with \\"My Buddy\\" logo on chest * white socks *red shoes with white stripe *the whole doll (besides head) was stuffed fabric. *face had blue or brown eyes, freckles, \\"button\\" nose, and smile An African American version, outfitted the same as the brown-haired Caucasian doll, was available. Playskool The dolls released by Playskool in the 1990s were made with unremovable clothing sewn directly onto the doll's body. The new Kid Sister was also released with clothes sewn onto the body, despite complaints, making it virtually impossible to dress it in different outfits. This was done to reduce the extra cost of having to produce clothes separately, so it was all kept on one assembly line. Advertising The \\"official\\" song used in marketing the doll in advertisements was: \\"My Buddy, My Buddy, Wherever I go, he goes. My Buddy, My Buddy, I'll teach him everything that I know. My Buddy and me, Like to climb up a tree. My buddy and me, We're the best friends that could be. My Buddy, My Buddy, My Buddy and Me!\\"\\"My Buddy Doll Song\\" . The Best Doll Information (website) . Accessed October 2010. In popular culture *The doll was jokingly depicted as My Stalker in an episode of Adult Swim's Robot Chicken. *The doll was parodied in Clarence as Clarence's Li'l Buddy doll, in an episode of the same name. *In season 2, episode 11, episode \\"Meat the Parrots\\" of the show Happy Endings, Penny complains that she never had a kid sister; the closest she got was a My Buddy doll. When asked why she never got a Kid Sister doll, she said she did, but they weren't that close. *On the Bleacher Report podcast Simms & Lefkoe, Chris Simms parodies the commercial theme of My Buddy as \\"My Homie\\" in an homage to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. *In the music video for Wanksta, by rapper 50 cent, there is a likeness of the My Buddy doll that presents a more 'gangster look'.

Life and career  Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Freeman started on guitar when he was ten years old. His first teacher was a session musician in Nashville who knew his father. He followed his teacher around Nashville studios and after six years worked in a variety of sessions as a professional guitarist. Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, where he found work playing for commercials and with vocalists Englebert Humperdinck and Anne Murray. He cites George Benson and Larry Carlton as influences. For one year he attended the California Institute of the Arts. He recorded his first solo album, Nocturnal Playground. In 1985, he founded the band The Rippingtons as an opportunity to record with a variety of musicians. The first version of the band included David Benoit, Brandon Fields, Kenny G, and Dave Koz. By 1993, the Rippingtons had solidified into a sextet of Freeman, Jeff Kashiwa on saxophone, Dave Kochanski on keyboards, Kim Stone on bass guitar, Tony Morales on drums, and Steve Reid on percussion. In 1994 Freeman reunited with Benoit for The Benoit/Freeman Project. Freeman and his manager, Andi Howard, formed Peak Records in 1994. In 1998 he collaborated with guitarist Craig Chaquico of Starship for the album From the Redwoods to the Rockies. A record producer and arranger, Freeman also plays bass guitar, keyboards, and drums. His music can be heard during The Weather Channel's Local on the 8s segments, and his song \\"Brave New World\\" is included in the 2008 compilation album, The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II. His wife, Yaredt Leon, has composed music for The Rippingtons' albums.

The circuit was first published in Practical Wireless magazine. The amplifier featured five valves and an output of 10 watts - hence '5-10'. Of those valves, one was a full-wave rectifier (an EZ80 or EZ81), one was a pre-amplifier pentode EF86 and one a double-triode ECC83 as phase splitter. The power amplification was handled by a pair of EL84 working in push-pull configuration. The frequency response of the circuit was from 40Hz to 20,000Hz with less than 0.2% THD. In 1959 Mullard published its famous booklet \\"Mullard Circuits for Audio Amplifiers\\" covering a range of amplifier and pre-amplifier circuits using valves developed within the Receiving Valve Development Department at the New Road factory. The circuit design of the Mullard 5-10, together with the recommended Partridge output transformers, was famous for its unique sound reproduction and many variations of this amplifier (including Mullard's own 20-watt version, the Mullard 5-20 using the EL34) were in widespread use until the end of the valve era; similar designs are still manufactured as expensive equipment for valve audiophiles.

This cluster was first discovered in mass spectrometry experiments. Electrospray ionization of an aerosol of serine in methanol results in a mass spectrum with a prominent ion peak of 841 corresponding to the Ser8+H+ cation. The smaller and larger clusters are virtually absent in the spectrum and therefore the number 8 is called a magic number. The same octamer ions are also produced by rapid evaporation of a serine solution on a hot (200-250 ¬∞C) metal surface or by sublimation of solid serine. After production, detection again is by mass-spectroscopic means. For the discussion of homochirality, these laboratory production methods are designed to mimic prebiotic conditions. The cluster is not only unusually stable but also unusual because the clusters have a strong homochiral preference. A racemic serine solution produces a minimum amount of cluster and with solutions of both enantiomers a maximum amount is formed of both homochiral D-Ser8 and L-Ser8. In another experiment cluster formation of a racemic mixture with deuterium enriched L-serine results in a product distribution with hardly any 50/50 D/L clusters but a preference for either D or L enantioenriched clusters. A model for chiral amplification is proposed whereby enantioenriched clusters are formed from a non-racemic mixture already enriched by L-serine as a result of a mirror-symmetry breaking process. Cluster formation is followed by isolation and on subsequent dissociation of the cluster a serene solution forms with a higher concentration of L-serine than in the original mixture. A cycle can be maintained in which each turn results in an incremental enrichment in L-serine. Many such cycles eventually result in enantiopure L-serine. This model has been experimentally verified. Chiral transmission is assumed to take place through so-called substitution reactions of serine clusters. In these reactions, a serine monomer in a cluster can be replaced by another small biologically relevant molecule. For instance Ser8 reacts with glucose (Glc) to the Ser6 \\\\+ Glc3 \\\\+ Na+ cluster. Moreover, the cluster of synthetic L-glucose with Ser8 is less abundant than that with the biological D-glucose.

He was mentioned in relation with the campaigns of Marcus Licinius Crassus (grandson of the triumvir). His capital, Genucla, was besieged by the Romans in 28 BC, but he managed to escape and flee to his Scythian allies. Earlier, Antonius Hybrida, the governor of Moesia, was defeated beneath the walls of Histria in 61 BC. The Getae under Zyraxes and the bastarnae of Scythia were allied with the Histrians, but it seems that the main victors of this conflict were the Getae, as they were the keepers of the battle trophies and brought them back to Genucla, Zyraxes' capital. The trophies were recovered by Marcus Licinius Crassus when he attacked the Genucla fortress, situated somewhere on the bank of the Danube, in 28 BC. Zyraxes knew well enough that he could not hold on his own and retreated across the Danube to the Bastarnae (Scythians), with whom he was allied, while also taking the treasure with him. The fortress fell in his absence, after a brief but hard siege.

He was from a prominent Roman Catholic family originating in Cheshire. He was killed during the Siege of Drogheda during the Cromwellian Conquest of Ireland. Early career in central Europe Aston was the son of another Sir Arthur Aston, of Fulham, Middlesex, and the grandson of Sir Thomas Aston of Aston in Bucklow Hundred, Cheshire.Biographia Britannica, v.1, p.242 Aston's father was a professional soldier who had served in Russia in the 1610s, and, being a Catholic, had caught the attention and trust of the Polish king Sigismund III. Arthur Aston senior agreed to raise 2,000 British mercenaries for the Polish crown for the Turkish war of 1621. Though most of these mercenaries bound for Poland were turned back by Protestant Denmark in the Denmark Straits, Captain Arthur Aston Junior successfully landed about 300 British and Irish men of his father's levies in Poland in 1621. These troops later formed a guard for the King of Poland. Arthur Aston Senior died in 1624. Aston advanced to the rank of Major by 1627, and saw considerable service during the Polish-Swedish wars.Richard Brzezinski, British mercenaries in the Baltic (1), Military Illustrated, Past & Present, No.4 (London, 1987). He was captured by Swedish troops near Danzig in 1627. After the Truce of Altmark of 1629, Aston left Poland for the service of Sweden and was commissioned by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to raise an English regiment in 1631. His unit was shipped from Britain in 1632, but fought in the secondary theatres of Germany, never attaining the fame of Scots units such as Mackay's Regiment. Its strength had fallen so much, mostly due to sickness, that by 1634 Aston was recruiting Germans to fill the ranks.Richard Brzezinski, The Army of Gustavus Adolphus (1): Infantry, (London: Osprey, 1991). Career in the English Civil War By 1640 Aston had returned to Britain, and he commanded a regiment for King Charles during the Second Bishops' War. There was uneasiness in many quarters about his religion, and he was forced to resign his command, although he received a knighthood for his services. In 1642, when the First English Civil War broke out, Charles initially refused to employ him on account of his Catholic faith, but Prince Rupert of the Rhine persuaded him to do so. To counter anti- Catholic propaganda, Edward Hyde claimed that Aston was the only officer in the King's army who was a Papist, \\"if he were one\\", although at least six other officers of the rank of Colonel or above were also known to be Catholics. Aston was employed as Colonel General of Dragoons, and served in this capacity during the Edgehill campaign. When Charles made Oxford his wartime capital, Aston was made commander of an outpost at Reading, where he became unpopular through his authoritarian methods. He was wounded when Reading was besieged (struck on the head by a falling tile), and was captured by the Parliamentarians under the Earl of Essex. He was released by prisoner exchange and became Sergeant-Major General of Horse to Prince Rupert. He fought at the Storming of Bristol and the First Battle of Newbury. Aston became governor of Oxford in late 1643 and again made himself unpopular, until he lost a leg as a result of a fall from a horse at Horspath in September 1644 and was relieved as governor. He received a large pension from the King, but did not hold any appointments during the rest of the First English Civil War. In 1648, Aston joined the Earl of Ormonde, who had recently been made Commander-in-Chief of the Irish Confederates and other Royalist forces in Ireland. He was made governor of the vital port of Drogheda. Drogheda was a Protestant town in The Pale and had previously supported Parliament through two sieges by Irish Confederates. In 1649, Oliver Cromwell laid siege to Drogheda. The siege ended on 11 September, when Cromwell's forces stormed the town. Cromwell's troops were ordered to show no quarter to any man bearing arms;Reilly 1999, p. 71. in Cromwell's words, in the heat of the action, \\"I forbade them to spare any that were in arms in the town...\\", and many of the defenders were killed by the victorious Parliamentarian soldiers. Aston and other English Royalists retreated to the defensible Millmount Fort. They eventually agreed to surrender after a parley on the bridge, but were massacred after they laid down their arms. It is widely believed that the Parliamentarian soldiers killed Aston by bashing his brains out with his own wooden leg, which they believed to conceal gold coins. Aston was said to have had a daughter, Elizabeth Thomson alias Aston, and to have been created a Doctor of Physic in 1644.Biographia Britannica, 243 References *British Civil Wars, Commonwealth & Protectorate: Sir Arthur Aston 1590-1649 * Reilly, Tom (1999).

Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the urinary bladder. Urination results in urine being excreted from the body through the urethra. Cellular metabolism generates many by-products that are rich in nitrogen and must be cleared from the bloodstream, such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine. These by-products are expelled from the body during urination, which is the primary method for excreting water-soluble chemicals from the body. A urinalysis can detect nitrogenous wastes of the mammalian body. Urine has a role in the earth's nitrogen cycle. In balanced ecosystems, urine fertilizes the soil and thus helps plants to grow. Therefore, urine can be used as a fertilizer. Some animals use it to mark their territories. Historically, aged or fermented urine (known as lant) was also used for gunpowder production, household cleaning, tanning of leather and dyeing of textiles. Human urine and feces are collectively referred to as human waste or human excreta, and are managed via sanitation systems. Livestock urine and feces also require proper management if the livestock population density is high. Physiology The chemical structure of Urea Most animals have excretory systems for elimination of soluble toxic wastes. In humans, soluble wastes are excreted primarily by the urinary system and, to a lesser extent in terms of urea, removed by perspiration. The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. The system produces urine by a process of filtration, reabsorption, and tubular secretion. The kidneys extract the soluble wastes from the bloodstream, as well as excess water, sugars, and a variety of other compounds. The resulting urine contains high concentrations of urea and other substances, including toxins. Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureter, bladder, and finally the urethra before passing from the body. = Duration = Research looking at the duration of urination in a range of mammal species found that nine larger species urinated for 21 ¬± 13 seconds irrespective of body size. Smaller species, including rodents and bats, cannot produce steady streams and instead urinate with a series of drops. Characteristics =Quantity= Average urine production in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine per person per day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L per person per day, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing too much or too little urine needs medical attention. Polyuria is a condition of excessive production of urine (> 2.5 L/day), oliguria when < 400 mL are produced, and anuria being < 100 mL per day. =Constituents= Urine under the microscope About 91-96% of urine consists of water. Urine also contains an assortment of inorganic salts and organic compounds, including proteins, hormones, and a wide range of metabolites, varying by what is introduced into the body. The total solids in urine are on average 59 g per person per day. Organic matter makes up between 65% and 85% of urine dry solids, with volatile solids comprising 75‚Äì85% of total solids. Urea is the largest constituent of the solids, constituting more than 50% of the total. On an elemental level, human urine contains 6.87 g/L carbon, 8.12 g/L nitrogen, 8.25 g/L oxygen, and 1.51 g/L hydrogen. The exact proportions vary with individuals and with factors such as diet and health. In healthy persons, urine contains very little protein and an excess is suggestive of illness. =Color= Medical experts have long connected urine colour with certain medical conditions. A medieval chart showing the medical implications of different urine color Urine varies in appearance, depending principally upon a body's level of hydration, as well as other factors. Normal urine is a transparent solution ranging from colorless to amber but is usually a pale yellow. In the urine of a healthy individual, the color comes primarily from the presence of urobilin. Urobilin is a final waste product resulting from the breakdown of heme from hemoglobin during the destruction of aging blood cells. Colorless urine indicates over-hydration, generally preferable to dehydration (though it can remove essential salts from the body). Colorless urine in drug tests can suggest an attempt to avoid detection of illicit drugs in the bloodstream through over-hydration. * Dark yellow urine is often indicative of dehydration. * Yellowing/light orange may be caused by removal of excess B vitamins from the bloodstream. * Certain medications such as rifampin and phenazopyridine can cause orange urine. * Bloody urine is termed hematuria, a symptom of a wide variety of medical conditions. * Dark orange to brown urine can be a symptom of jaundice, rhabdomyolysis, or Gilbert's syndrome. * Black or dark-colored urine is referred to as melanuria and may be caused by a melanoma or non-melanin acute intermittent porphyria. * Pinkish urine can result from the consumption of beets. * Greenish urine can result from the consumption of asparagus or foods or beverages with green dyes. * Reddish or brown urine may be caused by porphyria (not to be confused with the harmless, temporary pink or reddish tint caused by beeturia). * Blue urine can be caused by the ingestion of methylene blue (e.g., in medications) or foods or beverages with blue dyes. * Blue urine stains can be caused by blue diaper syndrome. * Purple urine may be due to purple urine bag syndrome.

File:IMAG0466.jpgGreen urine during long term infusion of the sedative propofol. =Odor= Sometime after leaving the body, urine may acquire a strong \\"fish-like\\" odor because of contamination with bacteria that break down urea into ammonia. This odor is not present in fresh urine of healthy individuals; its presence may be a sign of a urinary tract infection. The odor of normal human urine can reflect what has been consumed or specific diseases. For example, an individual with diabetes mellitus may present a sweetened urine odor. This can be due to kidney diseases as well, such as kidney stones. Eating asparagus can cause a strong odor reminiscent of the vegetable caused by the body's breakdown of asparagusic acid. Likewise consumption of saffron, alcohol, coffee, tuna fish, and onion can result in telltale scents. Particularly spicy foods can have a similar effect, as their compounds pass through the kidneys without being fully broken down before exiting the body.Foods that Affect the Odor of Urine. livestrong.com. December 27, 2010. =Turbidity= Turbid (cloudy) urine may be a symptom of a bacterial infection, but can also be caused by crystallization of salts such as calcium phosphate. =pH= The pH normally is within the range of 5.5 to 7 with an average of 6.2. In persons with hyperuricosuria, acidic urine can contribute to the formation of stones of uric acid in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. Urine pH can be monitored by a physician or at home. A diet which is high in protein from meat and dairy, as well as alcohol consumption can reduce urine pH, whilst potassium and organic acids, such as from diets high in fruit and vegetables, can increase the pH and make it more alkaline. Some drugs also can increase urine pH, including acetazolamide, potassium citrate, and sodium bicarbonate. Cranberries, popularly thought to decrease the pH of urine, have actually been shown not to acidify urine. Drugs that can decrease urine pH include ammonium chloride, chlorothiazide diuretics, and methenamine mandelate.Urine pH: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia . Nlm.nih.gov (2011-03-28).

However, it contains compounds eliminated by the body as undesirable, and can be irritating to skin and eyes. With suitable processing, it is possible to extract potable water from urine. = Bacteria and pathogens = Urine is not sterile, not even in the bladder. Earlier studies, with less sophisticated analytical techniques, had found that urine was sterile until it reached the urethra. In the urethra, epithelial cells lining the urethra are colonized by facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rod and cocci bacteria. Examination for medical purposes A Doctor Examining Urine. Trophime Bigot.Many physicians in ancient history resorted to the inspection and examination of the urine of their patients. Hermogenes wrote about the color and other attributes of urine as indicators of certain diseases. Abdul Malik Ibn Habib of Andalusia d.862 AD, mentions numerous reports of urine examination throughout the Umayyad empire.Ibn Habib, Abdul Malik d.862CE/283AH \\"Kitaab Tib Al'Arab\\" (The Book of Arabian Medicine), Published by Dar Ibn Hazm, Beirut, Lebanon 2007(Arabic) Diabetes mellitus got its name because the urine is plentiful and sweet. The name uroscopy refers to any visual examination of the urine, including microscopy, although it often refers to the aforementioned prescientific or protoscientific forms of urine examination. Clinical urine tests today duly note the gross color, turbidity, and odor of urine but also include urinalysis, which chemically analyzes the urine and quantifies its constituents. A culture of the urine is performed when a urinary tract infection is suspected, as bacteria in the urine are unusual otherwise. A microscopic examination of the urine may be helpful to identify organic or inorganic substrates and help in the diagnosis. The color and volume of urine can be reliable indicators of hydration level. Clear and copious urine is generally a sign of adequate hydration. Dark urine is a sign of dehydration. The exception occurs when diuretics are consumed, in which case urine can be clear and copious and the person still be dehydrated.  Uses  hCG from it (Ede, the Netherlands) =Source of medications= Urine contains proteins and other substances that are useful for medical therapy and are ingredients in many prescription drugs (e.g., Ureacin, Urecholine, Urowave). Urine from postmenopausal women is rich in gonadotropins that can yield follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone for fertility therapy. One such commercial product is Pergonal.[Adelson, Andrea.

Urine from pregnant women contains enough human chorionic gonadotropins for commercial extraction and purification to produce hCG medication. Pregnant mare urine is the source of estrogens, namely Premarin. Urine also contains antibodies, which can be used in diagnostic antibody tests for a range of pathogens, including HIV-1.Urine Antibody Tests: New Insights into the Dynamics of HIV-1 Infection ‚Äì Urnovitz et al. 45 (9): 1602 ‚Äì Clinical Chemistry . Clinchem.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-27. Urine after four months of storage, ready to be used in gardening activities (note the colour and turbidity change compared to fresh human urine). Fresh human urine after excretion Urine can also be used to produce urokinase, which is used clinically as a thrombolytic agent. =Fertilizer= Urine contains large quantities of nitrogen (mostly as urea), as well as reasonable quantities of dissolved potassium. The exact composition of nutrients in urine varies with diet, in particular nitrogen content in urine is related to the quantity of protein in the diet. A high protein diet results in high urea levels in urine. Urine is very high in nitrogen (can be over 10% in a high-protein diet), low in phosphorus (1%), and moderate in potassium (2-3%). Urine typically contributes 70% of the nitrogen and more than half of the potassium found in urban wastewater flows, while making up less than 1% of the overall volume. If urine is to be separated and collected for use as a fertiliser in agriculture, then the easiest method of doing so is with sanitation systems that utilise waterless urinals, urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) or urine diversion flush toilets.von M√ºnch, E., Winker, M. (2011). Technology review of urine diversion components - Overview on urine diversion components such as waterless urinals, urine diversion toilets, urine storage and reuse systems. Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH Undiluted urine can chemically burn the leaves or roots of some plants, particularly if the soil moisture content is low, therefore it is usually applied diluted with water. When diluted with water (at a 1:5 ratio for container-grown annual crops with fresh growing medium each season or a 1:8 ratio for more general use), it can be applied directly to soil as a fertilizer. The fertilization effect of urine has been found to be comparable to that of commercial nitrogen fertilizers. Concentrations of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, commonly found in sewage sludge, are much lower in urine. Urine can also be used safely as a source of nitrogen in carbon-rich compost. The health risks of using urine as a natural source of agricultural fertilizer are generally regarded as negligible, especially when dispersed in the soil rather than on the part of the plant that is consumed. Urine can even be distributed via perforated hoses buried some 10 cm under the surface of the soil among our crop plants, thus minimizing risk of odors, loss of nutrients, or transmission of pathogens. =Cleaning= Given that the urea in urine breaks down into ammonia, urine has been used for cleaning. In pre- industrial times, urine was used ‚Äì in the form of lant or aged urine ‚Äì as a cleaning fluid.Sueton, Vespasian 23 English, Latin. Cf. Dio Cassius, Roman History, Book 65, chapter 14,5 English, Greek/French (66, 14) Urine was also used for whitening teeth in Ancient Rome. =Gunpowder= Urine was used before the development of a chemical industry in the manufacture of gunpowder. Urine, a nitrogen source, was used to moisten straw or other organic material, which was kept moist and allowed to rot for several months to over a year. The resulting salts were washed from the heap with water, which was evaporated to allow collection of crude saltpeter crystals, that were usually refined before being used in making gunpowder. =Survival uses= The US Army Field ManualWater Procurement , US Army Field Manual advises against drinking urine for survival. These guides explain that drinking urine tends to worsen rather than relieve dehydration due to the salts in it, and that urine should not be consumed in a survival situation, even when there is no other fluid available. In hot weather survival situations, where other sources of water are not available, soaking cloth (a shirt for example) in urine and putting it on the head can help cool the body. During World War I, Germans experimented with numerous poisonous gases as weapons. After the first German chlorine gas attacks, Allied troops were supplied with masks of cotton pads that had been soaked in urine. It was believed that the ammonia in the pad neutralized the chlorine. These pads were held over the face until the soldiers could escape from the poisonous fumes. The Vickers machine gun, used by the British Army during World War I, required water for cooling when fired so soldiers would resort to urine if water was unavailable. Urban legend states that urine works well against jellyfish stings. This scenario has appeared many times in popular culture including in the Friends episode \\"The One With the Jellyfish\\", an early episode of Survivor, as well as the films The Real Cancun (2003), The Heartbreak Kid (2007) and The Paperboy (2012).

Ancient Romans used fermented human urine (in the form of lant) to cleanse grease stains from clothing. The emperor Nero instituted a tax () on the urine industry, continued by his successor, Vespasian. The Latin saying Pecunia non olet (money doesn't smell) is attributed to Vespasian ‚Äì said to have been his reply to a complaint from his son about the unpleasant nature of the tax. Vespasian's name is still attached to public urinals in France (vespasiennes), Italy (vespasiani), and Romania (vespasiene). Alchemists spent much time trying to extract gold from urine, which led to discoveries such as white phosphorus by German alchemist Hennig Brand when distilling fermented urine in 1669. In 1773 the French chemist Hilaire Rouelle discovered the organic compound urea by boiling urine dry.  Society and culture  = Language = The English word urine (, ) comes from the Latin urina (-ae, f.), which is cognate with ancient words in various Indo-European languages that concern water, liquid, diving, rain, and urination. The onomatopoetic term piss was the usual word for urination before the 14th century and is now considered vulgar. Urinate was at first used mostly in medical contexts. Piss is also used in such colloquialisms as to piss off, piss poor, and the slang expression pissing down to mean heavy rain. Euphemisms and expressions used between parents and children (such as wee, pee, and many others) have long existed. Lant is a word for aged urine, originating from the Old English word hland referring to urine in general.

Location and Geography Cocalzinho, as it is known by the inhabitants, is located in the micro-region of Entorno do Distrito Federal, on highway BR-414, almost at the junction with highway BR-070. It is 132 kilometers from the state capital, Goi√¢nia and is 127 km from the national capital, Brasilia. Municipal boundaries are with: *North: Padre Bernardo and Vila Prop√≠cio *South: Corumb√° de Goi√°s *East: Santo Ant√¥nio do Descoberto and √Åguas Lindas de Goi√°s *West: Piren√≥polis The elevation varies between 800 and 1,200 meters. Geographical relief is very irregular since the region is crossed by the Continental Divider of Waters, which separates the river basins of the Amazon and the Plata. Therefore, there are numerous springs that grow until they form the major rivers of South America. For this reason it is called the Ber√ßo das √Åguas (the Cradle of Waters). Major rivers are: Rio Verde, Oliveira Costa, Jacar√©, Piqui, Taquaral, Corumb√°, and Areias. There are many waterfalls and swimming spots. Nearby in neighboring Corumb√° de Goi√°s there is a cavern called Gruta dos Ecos, with one of the largest subterranean lakes in South America. The municipality contains part of the Pirineus State Park, created in 1987. This contains Pico dos Pireneus, the highest point in the region, with an elevation of 1,385 meters. History Cocalzinho began in 1960 with the arrival of a cement plant, Companhia de Cimento Portland Ita√∫, which closed down in 1996 putting five thousand families out of work. Since then the local population has either left for better opportunities or continued working in agriculture. Today the economy is based on agriculture, cattle raising, dairy industries and rock quarries. The area is rich in sand and decorative rock. The name \\"Cocalzinho\\" comes from a stream called Coc√° or Cocal, which has its source near the seat of the municipality. When highway BR-414 is paved up to Niquel√¢ndia, Cocalzinho will benefit from tourism since there will be a tourist route from the Serra da Mesa lake to the Chapada dos Veadeiros national park.

Home health care is a cost efficient way to deliver quality care in the convenience of the client's home. Home health nurses create care plans to achieve goals based on the client's diagnosis. These plans can include preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative actions. Home health nurses also supervise certified nursing assistants. The professional nursing organization for home health nurses is the Home Healthcare Nurses Association (HHNA). Home health care is intended for clients that are well enough to be discharged home, but still require skilled nursing personnel to assess, initiate and oversee nursing interventions. History Lillian Wald is recognized as the pioneer of public health nursing. She established the Henry Street Settlement which served underprivileged individuals and families. Nurses and social workers that worked at the Henry Street Settlement visited patients in their homes, assessed their health needs, and provided support with hygiene, nutrition, immunizations and more. Wald was able to convince Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to cover home care services. This allowed public health nursing to shift from charitable work to profitable work.  Roles and responsibilities  There is a wide range of services that are performed by many different professionals, services include wound care, disease management, medical equipment, therapy, medical social services, and patient education. Home health nurses have a wide range of duties and services provided, and in addition to services provided nurses also consult with doctors on the status of the patient and provide feedback on any potential changes that need to be made to the care plan. Some responsibilities that home health nurses take on include promoting health and disease prevention, medication administration, educating patients on their current diagnosis, providing emotional support, and providing basic care such as personal hygiene. Nurses also step into the role of case managers, meaning that they coordinate services from different disciplines for the patient. This can include rehabilitation, pharmacy, community resources and more. Providing the most up-to-date and effective care for a patient is also a very important part of a home health nurse's job. They do this by continually keeping up to date on the latest research and Evidence-Based Practice.  Education and certification  Home health nurses can have a nursing diploma, be a licensed practical nurse, have an associate of science in nursing, or a bachelor of science in nursing. They can then sit for a test through the American Nurses Credentialing Center that will allow them to become a certified home health care nurse.  Scope and standards of practice  The scope of home health nursing is directly related to the nursing process. This includes assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The standards of home health nursing integrate research, education, proper use of resources, the quality of care provided, team collaboration, and ethical principles.  Barriers in home health nursing  Home health nursing is a unique field considering the obstacles faced by the healthcare professionals. When out visiting clients, the nurse is alone and is not able to rely on others most of the time. Nurses in home health care must learn to be autonomous. The variety of home condition that a nurse will step into can also present problems. Cleanliness and safety play large roles in client care. Not all homes are equipped to provide a clean environment for the client. Environmental issues in the home include unsanitary conditions that allow for bacterial growth and conditions that may increase the risk of falling for the client, such as poor lighting and area rugs. Education regarding this is important for the nurse to share with the client. Medication adherence is also more complicated at home. Unlike in a hospital setting, the medication is scheduled around the clock and readily available. It is really dependent on the client's resources and financial situation. Also, client compliance, or client adherence to the plan of care, factors into client health outcomes.  Eligibility  Home health care is generally less expensive and more convenient then in the hospital. When possible home health care helps regain independence, become more self- sufficient, and maintain current level of function. The primary payer for home health care is Medicare dependent on meeting certain eligibility criteria. Home health services are covered when all of the following criteria are met: # Patient is under the care of a doctor, and getting services under a plan of care established. # A doctor certifies that the patient needs, one or more of the following: intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech- language pathology, and continued occupational therapy # Home health agency caring for patient is approved by Medicare # Doctor certifies that patient is homebound # As part of eligibility, a doctor or health care professional must document that they have had a face to face encounter within required timeframe and the reason was related to need for home health care Eligibility for home health care is determined by intermittent skilled nursing care that is needed fewer than 7 days each week and daily less than 8 hours each day for up to 21 days.

Modelled after the American Golden Globe Awards, the formal ceremony at which the awards are presented is one of the most prominent award ceremonies in Russia, alongside the Nika Award. The national Russian award is given out in 20 categories each January for motion pictures and TV series produced in Russia during the previous year. The awarding statuette is a silver eagle, originally made from copper with a jade pedestal, and was designed by sculptor Viktor Mitroshin. The design was later altered by the Spanish company Carrera y Carrera. The award was conceived by Nikita Mikhalkov as a counterweight to the Nika Award established in 1987 and run by the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences in Moscow. History The Golden Eagle Award was founded on 4 March 2002 by the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of Russia. At the XXIV Moscow International Film Festival on 26 June 2002, the Golden Eagle was officially inaugurated by the National Academy of Cinematographic Sciences. Winners were Andrei Tarkovsky, George Zhzhyonov, Fyodor Khitruk, Tatiana Samoilova, Michel Legrand, and Bernardo Bertolucci. The Golden Eagle Award was modelled by film director Nikita Mihalkov after the Golden Globe Awards as a counterweight to the Nika Award, established in 1987 and run by the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences in Moscow. On 20 September 2002, the declaration of the first nominees took place in a press conference at the Union of Cinematographers. However, the ceremony of the cinema, scheduled for 27 September 2002, was transferred in connection with the death of Sergei Bodrov, Jr. and his crew, who died in the Karmadon Gorge. As a result, the first award ceremony was held on 25 January 2003. Design Originally, the \\"Golden Eagle\\" statue was made from copper with golden alloy around it and its pedestal from jade. It was created by sculptor Viktor Mitroshin, but later altered by the Spanish company Carrera y Carrera, which is based in Madrid. People of eight different professions, including the designer and polisher, manufacture each instance in about 55 hours. Categories The Golden Eagle Award consists of 20 merit awards for films from the previous year, as well as honorary awards for lifetime achievement. *Best Feature Film *Best TV Movie or Mini-Series *Best Television Series *Best Documentary *Best Animated Feature Film *Best Director *Best Screenplay *Best Actress in a Film *Best Actress on Television *Best Leading Actor *Best Actor on Television *Best Supporting Actress *Best Supporting Actor * Best Cinematography *Best Art Direction *Best Costume Design *Best Music Score *Best Film Editing *Best Sound Engineer *Best Foreign Language Film References External links Category:Russian film awards Category:Russian television awards Category:Awards established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in Russia ","title":"Golden Eagle Award (Russia)"},{"id":"3938470","text":"The history of international law examines the evolution and development of public international law in both state practice and conceptual understanding. Modern international law developed out of Renaissance Europe and is strongly entwined with the development of western political organisation at that time. The development of European notions of sovereignty and nation states would necessitate the development of methods for interstate relations and standards of behaviour, and these would lay the foundations of what would become international law. However, while the origins of the modern system of international law can be traced back 400 years, the development of the concepts and practises that would underpin that system can be traced back to ancient historical politics and relationships thousands of years old. Important concepts are derived from the practice between Greek city-states and the Roman law concept of ius gentium (which regulated contacts between Roman citizens and non-Roman people). These principles were not universal however. In East Asia, political theory was based not on the equality of states, but rather the cosmological supremacy of the Emperor of China.  Early history  Basic concepts of international law such as treaties can be traced back thousands of years. Early examples of treaties include around 2100 BC an agreement between the rulers of the city-states of Lagash and Umma in Mesopotamia, inscribed on a stone block, setting a prescribed boundary between their two states. Around 1000 BC, an agreement was signed between Ramses II of Egypt and the king of the Hittites establishing \\"eternal peace and brotherhood\\" between their two nations: dealing with respect for each other's territory and establishing a form of defensive alliance. The ancient Greeks before Alexander the Great formed many small states that constantly interacted. In peace and in war, an inter-state culture evolved that prescribed certain rules for how these states would interact. These rules did not apply to interactions with non-Greek states, but among themselves the Greek inter-state community resembled in some respects the modern international community. The Roman Empire did not develop an international law, as it acted without regard to any external rules in its dealings with those territories that were not already part of the empire. The Romans did, however, form municipal laws governing the interactions between private Roman citizens and foreigners. These laws, called the jus gentium (as opposed to the jus civile governing interactions between citizens) codified some ideas of basic fairness, and attributed some rules to an objective, independent \\"natural law.\\" These jus gentium ideas of fairness and natural law have survived and are reflected in modern international law. Early Islamic law's principles concerning military conduct and the treatment of prisoners of war under the early Caliphate are considered precursors to international humanitarian law. The many requirements on how prisoners of war should be treated included, for example, providing shelter, food and clothing, respecting their cultures, and preventing any acts of execution, rape or revenge. Some of these principles were not codified in Western international law until modern times. Islamic law under the early Caliphate institutionalised humanitarian limitations on military conduct, including attempts to limit the severity of war, guidelines for ceasing hostilities, distinguishing between civilians and combatants, preventing unnecessary destruction, and caring for the sick and wounded.  Nation-states  After the fall of the Roman Empire and the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire into independent cities, principalities, kingdoms and nations, for the first time there was a real need for rules of conduct between a large international community. Without an empire or a dominant religious leadership to moderate and direct international dealings, most of Europe looked to Justinian's code of law from the Roman Empire, and the canon law of the Catholic Church for inspiration. International trade was the real catalyst for the development of objective rules of behaviour between states. Without a code of conduct, there was little to guarantee trade or protect the merchants of one state from the actions of another. Economic self-interest drove the evolution of common international trade rules, and most importantly the rules and customs of maritime law. As international trade, exploration and warfare became more involved and complex, the need for common international customs and practices became even more important. The Hanseatic League of the more than 150 entities in what is now Germany, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states developed many useful international customs, which facilitated trade and communication among other things. The Italian city-states developed diplomatic rules, as they began sending ambassadors to foreign capitals. Treaties‚Äîagreements between governments intended to be binding‚Äîbecame a useful tool to protect commerce. The horrors of the Thirty Years' War, meanwhile, created an outcry for rules of combat that would protect civilian communities.  Hugo Grotius  International practices, customs, rules and treaties proliferated to the point of complexity. Several scholars sought to compile them all into organized treatises. The most important of these was Hugo Grotius, whose treatise De Jure Belli Ac Pacis Libri Tres is considered the starting point for modern international law. Before Hugo Grotius, most European thinkers treated law as something independent of mankind, with its own existence. Some laws were invented by men, but ultimately they reflected the essential natural law. Grotius was no different, except in one important respect: Unlike the earlier thinkers, who believed that the natural law was imposed by a deity, Grotius believed that the natural law came from an essential universal reason, common to all men. This rationalist perspective enabled Grotius to posit several rational principles underlying law. Law was not imposed from above, but rather derived from principles. Foundation principles included the axioms that promises must be kept, and that harming another requires restitution. These two principles have served as the basis for much of subsequent international law. Apart from natural-law principles, Grotius also dealt with international custom, or voluntary law. Grotius emphasized the importance of actual practices, customs and treaties‚Äîwhat \\"is\\" done‚Äîas opposed to normative rules of what \\"ought to be\\" done. This positivist approach to international law strengthened over time. As nations became the predominant form of state in Europe, and their man-made laws became more important than religious doctrines and philosophies, the law of what \\"is\\" similarly became more important than the law of what \\"ought to be.\\"  Peace of Westphalia  The Westphalian treaties of 1648 were a turning point in establishing the principle of state sovereignty as a cornerstone of the international order. However the first attempts at formulating autonomous theories of international law occurred before this, in Spain, in the 16th century. Most prominent among the early theorizers were the Roman Catholic theologians Francisco de Vitoria and Francisco Su√°rez. Su√°rez is especially notable in this regard in that he distinguished between ius inter gentes and ius intra gentes which he derived from ius gentium (the rights of peoples). Ius inter gentes corresponds to modern international law. In 1625, Hugo Grotius followed with the first systematic treatise on international law, de iure belli ac pacis, which dealt with the laws of war and peace. One important aspect of Grotius's treatment of international law is that he no longer bases it exclusively upon natural law, but also accepts that states among themselves can also create binding rules of law (ius voluntarium). Still, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the idea of natural law as a basis for international law remained influential, and were further expressed in the works of Samuel von Pufendorf and Christian Wolff. Yet, in the second half of the 18th century, a shift occurs towards positivism in international law. In addition, the idea of international law as a means for maintaining international peace is challenged due to the increasing tensions between the European great powers (France, Prussia, Great-Britain, Russia and Austria). This tension between legal norms and political imperatives is well reflected in the century's most important treatise on international law, Emer de Vattel's Du Droit des Gens (1758). At the end of the century, Immanuel Kant believes that international law as a law that can justify war does not serve the purpose of peace anymore, and therefore argues in Perpetual Peace (Zum Ewigen Frieden, 1795) and the Metaphysics of Morals (Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797) for creating a new kind of international law. After World War I, an attempt was made to establish such a new international law of peace, of which the League of Nations was considered to be one of the cornerstones, but this attempt failed. The Charter of the United Nations (1945) in fact reflects the fact that the traditional notion of state sovereignty remains the key concept in the law of nations. However, as recent research has shown, ius contra bellum (the outlawry of war) has its roots in 19th legal and political discourse.Simon, Hendrik (2018). \\"The Myth of Liberum Ius ad Bellum: Justifying War in 19th-Century Legal Theory and Political Practice\\". EJIL. 29 (1): 113-136. https://doi.org/10.1093/ejil/chy009 In the historiography of international law, some German authors, most notably among them Wilhelm Grewe and Karl-Heinz Ziegler, have argued that several periods can be distinguished, such as the Spanish era (1494‚Äì1648), the French era (1648-1789/1815), the English era (1789/1815-1919) and the American era since 1919. The transitions between these eras are often marked by grand peace settlements, such as the earlier mentioned treaties of Westphalia (1645‚Äì48), the treaties of Ryswick and Utrecht (1697/1714), Vienna (1814‚Äì15), Paris (1919) and San Francisco (the UN Charter, 1945).  The League of Nations  Following World War I, as after the Thirty Years' War, there was an outcry for rules of warfare to protect civilian populations, as well as a desire to curb invasions. The League of Nations, established after the war, attempted to curb invasions by enacting a treaty agreement providing for economic and military sanctions against member states that used \\"external aggression\\" to invade or conquer other member states. An international court was established, the Permanent Court of International Justice, to arbitrate disputes between nations without resorting to war. Meanwhile, many nations signed treaties agreeing to use international arbitration rather than warfare to settle differences. International crises, however, demonstrated that nations were not yet committed to the idea of giving external authorities a say in how nations conducted their affairs. Aggression on the part of Germany, Italy and Japan went unchecked by international law, and it took a Second World War to end it.  The postwar era  After World War II, as after the First World War and the Thirty Years' War, there was a strong desire to never again endure the horrors of war endured by the civilian populations. The League of Nations was re- attempted through another treaty organization, the United Nations. The postwar era has been a highly successful one for international law. International cooperation has become far more commonplace, though of course not universal. Importantly, nearly two hundred nations are now members of the United Nations, and have voluntarily bound themselves to its charter. Even the most powerful nations have recognized the need for international cooperation and supports, and have routinely sought international agreement and consent before engaging in acts of war. International law is, of course, only partly about the conduct of war. Most rules are civil, concerning the delivery of mail, trade, shipping, air travel, and the like. Most rules are obeyed routinely by most countries, because the rules make life easier for all concerned. The rules are rarely disputed. But some international law is extremely political and hotly debated. This includes not just the laws of warfare but also such matters as fishing rights.  Modern customary international law  An important development in modern international law is the concept of \\"consent.\\" Before World War II, a nation would not have been considered to be bound by a rule unless it had formally agreed to be bound by it, or it was already customarily abiding by that rule. Now, however, merely consenting to an international practice is sufficient to be bound by it, without signing a treaty. An evolution of the positivist approach of Grotius, the concept of consent is an element of customary international law. Customary international law is essentially what states actually do, plus the opinio juris of what states believe international law requires them to do. Customary international law applies to every country, regardless of whether they have formally agreed to it. At the same time, all countries take part in forming customary international law by their practices and decisions. As new rules arise, countries accept, reject or modify them. When most countries are following a rule, everyone else will be held to it. Therefore, doing nothing is the same as consenting. Nations that did not take action may find themselves bound by an international law that is not to their advantage. Customary international law can be overruled, however, by a treaty. For this reason, much customary international law has been agreed to formally by treaties between nations. Modern treaty law Treaties are essentially contracts between countries. They are agreements by which the parties intend to be bound. If treaties are broken, their effectiveness is weakened because there is no guarantee that future promises will be kept. So there is a strong incentive for nations to take treaties very seriously. Modern nations engage in a two-step procedure for entering into treaties. The first step is signing the treaty. Being a signatory to a treaty means that a country intends to enter into the agreement. The second step is ratifying the treaty. A country that has ratified a treaty has gone beyond merely intending to enter into the agreement, and is now bound by it. This is a critical distinction, and sometimes a point of confusion. A nation may be a signatory to a treaty for many years without ever having ratified it. Each country ratifies treaties its own way. The United States requires the two-thirds support of the Senate, the upper body of its legislature, for a treaty to be ratified; both the executive and the legislature must agree. In Canada, on the other hand, ratification is strictly an executive action, and no parliamentary approval is required before the nation is bound. Modern treaties are interpreted according to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This convention is so widely accepted that even nations that are not parties to the convention follow it. The convention's most important and sensible rule is that a treaty should be interpreted according to the plain meaning of its language, in the context of its purpose, and in good faith. This prevents much squabbling and unnecessary nit-picking. It also makes treaty authors spell out what they are trying to accomplish, to make interpretation easier, in a non-binding \\"preamble.\\" In the modern world, international law is contested for its inability to enforce its rulings.

Welton now brews in Horsham, West Sussex. On average, Welton's brew in excess of 40 different beers every year as well as the seven core beers range and the Horsham Old. Ranging from low abv's to high abv porters. Nothing is rebadged. History Using the money he made from selling his drinks distribution business to Beer Seller, Ray Welton built Welton's Brewery using equipment he found in a field. The tax situation in the 1990s in Britain was not helpful to small brewers and eventually he had to brew on Arundel's equipment in order to save costs. When Andy Hepworth started up the Beer Station, Welton was able to move his own equipment and yeast onto the site and that was, for two years, a shared operation. But in August 2003, a year after the sliding scale for brewers was introduced, Welton set up independently. He is still using the equipment he built himself, though, like Fuller's Brewery, he is now using a bottom fermenting ale yeast which he feels gives him more beer per fermentation as a result of less foam in the tank. Since April 2017, Welton's have held a brewery tap night, on the first Friday of every month where new monthly specials can be tried. Beers Welton's produce a wide range of cask ales, which are distributed in the Horsham area and nationally through Wetherspoons and freehouses across the South East. Also distributed in bottles throughout Sussex by Hartleys Wines. In 1998 Ray (an avid rugby player) decided he wanted to brew a beer he could drink all night after playing, without becoming too inebriated. Pridenjoy 2.8% ABV was brewed and was included by Roger Protz and described in his book \\"300 Beer To Try Before You Die\\" 2005, ‚Äúas a most remarkable beer, a beer that is 2.8% but tastes like 4%‚Äù. In 2001, Fred Martin the retired head brewer of King & Barnes, handed on the Old Ale recipe (Horsham Old 4.5% ABV) which Weltons have been brewing since 2001 and continue to brew to this day. In 2016 Ray brewed two beers and aged them in Tomintoul malt whisky casks (aged 12 months). A rye beer Dr French's Whisky Rye 8.3% ABV & a porter Dr French's Old Remedy 8.3% ABV.

This sutta is number 72 in the Third Division on Wanderers [Paribbajakavagga], and has an alternate spelling of [Aggivacchagotta] by the Bhikkhu Nanamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi.Bhikkhu Nanamoli, Bhikkhu Bodhi, The Middle Length Discoures of the Buddha. Majjhima Nikaya.1995, Wisdom Publications. In this sutta, Gautama Buddha clarifies his views on the nature of existence and explains the nature of nirvana to Vacchagotta by means of a simile. A sentient being which is composed of Skandha who realized Nirvana is compared to an extinguished fire.Walpola Rahula, What the Buddha Taught, page 29. The thicket of views Vacchagotta first asks the Buddha whether he holds particular views on the extent of the cosmos, the relationship between mind and body, and the nature of a Tathagata's existence after death. To all the questions, Gautama Buddha simply replies he does not hold such views. Vacchagotta expresses confusion at this answer and asks why the Buddha takes no position regarding his questions. The Buddha explains that each question leads to an unresolvable thicket of views which will cause suffering and distress if investigated. Because such investigation cannot lead to enlightened understanding and nirvana, the Buddha takes no position on these subjects. The Tathagata is released due to true discernment and cessation of clinging. Nirvana Vacchagotta questions further. Where does the monk who has been released reappear? The following exchange results: : \\"'Reappear,' Vaccha, doesn't apply.\\" : \\"In that case, Master Gotama, he does not reappear.\\" : \\"'Does not reappear,' Vaccha, doesn't apply.\\" : \\"...both does & does not reappear.\\" : \\"...doesn't apply.\\" : \\"...neither does nor does not reappear.\\" : \\"...doesn't apply.\\" Vacchagotta's confusion increases. The Buddha asks him in which direction a fire goes when it has gone out. Vaccha replies that the question \\"does not fit the case ... For the fire that depended on fuel ... when that fuel has all gone, and it can get no other, being thus without nutriment, it is said to be extinct.\\" The Buddha then explains: \\"In exactly the same way ..., all form by which one could predicate the existence of the saint, all that form has been abandoned, uprooted, pulled out of the ground like a palmyra-tree, and become non- existent and not liable to spring up again in the future. The saint ... who has been released from what is styled form is deep, immeasurable, unfathomable, like the mighty ocean.\\" The same is then said of the other aggregates.Tyson Anderson, \\"Kalupahana on Nirvana.\\" Philosophy East and West, Vol. 40, No. 2 (Apr., 1990), page 225. . A tathƒÅgata has abandoned that clinging to the personality factors that render the mind a bounded, measurable entity, and is instead \\"freed from being reckoned by\\" all or any of them, even in life. The skandhas have been seen to be a burden, and an enlightened individual is one with \\"burden dropped\\".Peter Harvey, The Selfless Mind. Curzon Press 1995, page 229. A variety of similar passages make it clear that the metaphor \\"gone out, he cannot be defined\\" (') refers equally to liberation in life.Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, pages 91, 95. In the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta itself, it is clear that the Buddha is the subject of the metaphor, and the Buddha has already \\"uprooted\\" or \\"annihilated\\" the five aggregates.Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 95. In Sn 1074, it is stated that the sage cannot be \\"reckoned\\" because he is freed from the category \\"name\\" or, more generally, concepts. The absence of this precludes the possibility of reckoning or articulating a state of affairs; \\"name\\" here refers to the concepts or apperceptions that make propositions possible.Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 94. The fire metaphor used in the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta (which is also used elsewhere) is a radical way of making the point that the liberated sage is beyond phenomenal experience. It also makes the additional point that this indefinable, transcendent state is the sage's state even during life. This idea goes against the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 96. Dabba Sutta The Udana's Dabba Sutta makes use of related imagery: :: Just as the bourn is not known :: Of the gradual fading glow :: Given off by the furnace-heated iron, :: As it is struck with the smith's hammer, :: So there is no pointing to the bourn :: Of those perfectly released :: Who have crossed the flood :: Of bondage to sense desires :: And attained unshakable bliss. : -- Dabba Sutta, Udana VIII.10 In this case, the simile of the first four lines of the original Pali is obscure, and the above translation is only tentative regarding its intention.John D.

Brian was an inside forward who started his league career at Everton where he only made one appearance before joining Scunthorpe United in June 1960. He made his League debut for the Iron on the opening day of the season away to Charlton Athletic on 20 August 1960, scoring on his home debut five days later against Ipswich Town. He partnered ace marksman Barrie Thomas in the Iron's attack and helped them nearly reach the top flight when finishing 4th in the Second Division in 1961‚Äì62. This is Scunthorpe's highest ever position and resulted in him being spotted by the Welsh Under-23 selectors, becoming the first United player ever to receive such an honour. His last League game for the Iron was at home to Portsmouth on 21 September 1963. Preston North End paid ¬£8,000 for him in October 1963. He made his debut for Preston a couple of weeks later away at Northampton Town. He scored ten goals in his first fourteen League games for the club, including a hat trick against Ipswich Town in a 5‚Äì1 away win. In the 1965‚Äì66 season, Godfrey was Preston's leading goalscorer including a four-minute hat trick in the last game of the season: a 9‚Äì0 win against Cardiff City. His goalscoring exploits did not go unnoticed, as he certainly impressed the Welsh selectors after joining the famous Lilywhites, gaining three full international caps. Two of these were in 1964: against Northern Ireland in April 1964 at Swansea, scoring one goal on his international debut, and against Denmark in Copenhagen in the October. His third and final Welsh appearance came against Italy in Florence in May 1965, Godfrey getting the consolation goal in a 4‚Äì1 defeat. Everton apart, his entire career was spent with clubs outside the First Division. His biggest disappointment was on signing for Second Division Preston, and not being in the side that made its way to Wembley, losing in the FA Cup Final to West Ham United, after scoring in the sixth round victory over Oxford United. He did, however, help Preston finish third in the Second Division, just missing out on promotion. Godfrey was transferred, with Brian Greenhalgh, to Aston Villa in September 1967. He scored on his Villa debut, and he and Greenhalgh scored 18 goals between them in their first 17 games in Villa colours. Unfortunately, despite their efforts, Villa were relegated to the Third Division at the end of the 1969‚Äì70 season for the first time in the club's history. He managed to play and Captain Villa at Wembley in the 1970‚Äì71 League Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur while they were still a Third Division side, but finished on the Runners-up side. Villa also just missed out on promotion, finishing in fourth place in the League. He joined Bristol Rovers from Aston Villa for ¬£35,000 and Ray Graydon in part-exchange in September 1971. At Eastville he became an immediate inspiration to a young, developing Rovers team. One early highlight was a hat trick in a 7‚Äì1 home win over Bradford City. In the 1972‚Äì73 pre-season Watney Cup tournament Brian was a member of the team that beat Sheffield United in the final 7‚Äì6 on penalties, after the game finished scoreless in front of 19,768 spectators. Brian Godfrey also played his part in Rovers famous 2‚Äì1 victory at Old Trafford over Manchester United in a third round League Cup replay, the United team including the likes of Bobby Charlton, George Best and Brian Kidd. He helped Bristol Rovers to sixth and fifth places in the Third Division in consecutive seasons. They reached the fifth round of the League Cup in 1971‚Äì72 after beating three Second Division teams in Sunderland, Charlton Athletic and Queens Park Rangers before losing to First Division opponents and eventual winners Stoke City. In total, Godfrey scored 16 goals in 81 league games for Rovers, prior to joining Newport County for ¬£10,000 in June 1973 and becoming County's record signing at the time. From 1973‚Äì74 he was ever-present in the County side making 46 league appearances and scoring 7 goals, including a hat trick against Workington in a 4‚Äì0 home win. Godfrey was selected in the 1974 Fourth Division PFA Team of the Year. He left Newport at the end of the 1974‚Äì75 season having scored 18 goals in a total of 118 appearances for the club.Newport County A‚ÄìZ of transfers He then had a short spell in the North American Soccer League during the summer of 1975 as captain of the expansion team Portland Timbers, leading the club to the NASL league final. After that, Godfrey tried his hand in management for the first time, joining Bath City in July 1976. As a player-manager he guided Bath to fourth position in the Southern League in his first season, and then to the Championship in 1977‚Äì78. That year he also took Bath to the 1st round of the FA Cup, losing to Plymouth Argyle in a replay. His success with Bath did not go unnoticed, and in the middle of the following season he was approached by Exeter City, and left to succeed Bobby Saxton as Exeter manager in January 1979. He stayed for three and a half years until resigning in June 1983. Godfrey's most successful season was 1980‚Äì81, guiding Exeter into the sixth round of the FA Cup for only the second time in their history. During their cup run they overcame First Division Leicester City 3‚Äì1 and Second Division Newcastle United 4‚Äì0, both in replays at St James Park, before losing to First Division Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, with Graham Roberts and Paul Miller scoring in their club's 2‚Äì0 victory. Spurs went on to win the cup that year. Godfrey took Exeter to ninth in the League during his first season and eighth in 1979‚Äì80, City's best ever finish in the Division 3/4 structure. He quit at the end of the 1982‚Äì83 season after Exeter marginally avoided relegation to the Fourth Division. He had further managerial success at both Weymouth and Bath City again before joining Gloucester City in 1987. He guided them to the Southern League Midlands title in 1988‚Äì89 and won the DML Midland Division Manager of the Year (1988/89).Independent Tigers Online The 1989‚Äì90 season saw Godfrey take Gloucester City to the second round of the FA Cup for the first time in the club's history, losing 0‚Äì1 at home to Cardiff City after a 2‚Äì2 draw at Ninian Park. The Tigers also finished ninth in the Premier Division. The following year he built a side that came within three minutes of the Southern League title and promotion to the GM Vauxhall Conference, eventually finishing runners-up to Farnborough Town after the Hampshire side scored a late goal at Atherstone Town to give them the Championship on the last day of the season. Godfrey was sacked in 1991 following the breakup of his side due to financial problems. He was to return in February 1992 for a further spell before leaving the club in April 1994. He remained involved in football with Shortwood United before moving onto Cinderford Town, and then taking up scouting for Newport. He returned once more to Gloucester City as assistant manager, originally to Tommy Callinan until he resigned in 2001, and then with Chris Burns who took the chance to begin his football management career. Godfrey retired at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season to start a new life in Cyprus, and saw his long service to football rewarded with a testimonial between Gloucester City and Aston Villa. He died in a hospital in Nicosia near his home in Cyprus after a long battle with leukaemia on 11 February 2010.Wales mourns Godfrey He was remarried by this time, having previously been married for 32 years with a family of three daughters. Paying tribute to Godfrey, Dave Phillips, then Chairman of Gloucester City, said that Godfrey had \\"played a dramatic part in the progress of the club.\\" \\"He took us out of the doldrums during a period when we weren't doing that well. He will be remembered mainly for winning the Southern League Midland Division Championship as manager in 1989.

He was forced to retire in 1997 following a succession of injuries. Barnes represented England at under-19 level. Club career =Early career= Born in Paddington, Barnes was brought up in the Felixstowe area as a Barnardo's Boy. He featured for junior side South Suffolk Old Boys and was on the books at Ipswich Town as a schoolboy. However, he joined Coventry City as an apprentice in May 1979, and was converted from a striker to a full-back role. =Coventry City= While with Coventry, Barnes received England youth caps and honours while also making nine top-flight appearances at Highfield Road. He left in April 1982 to rejoin Ipswich on a free transfer. =Ipswich Town= Rejoining his boyhood club, Barnes spent two years at Portman Road where he made 17 appearances. He made his debut for the club in the First Division match against Swansea City on 27 November 1982 and made six first- team appearances during his first season with Town. He made a further ten starts and one substitute showing in his second season, before playing his final game in the East Anglian derby on 23 April 1984. =Wolverhampton Wanderers= Barnes secured a ¬£35,000 transfer to Wolverhampton Wanderers in October 1984 where he became a first-team regular, making 88 appearances in three seasons at Molineux. However, he joined just as Wolves were on a free- fall through the Football League, suffering two successive relegations to Division Four. He faced his future club Colchester United in the Football League play-offs at the semi-final stage in the 1986‚Äì87 season, overcoming Colchester to reach the final, but the club lost out to another of Barnes' future clubs, Aldershot, in the final at Wembley. =Aldershot= A move to play-off winners Aldershot was the next destination for Barnes for a ¬£25,000 fee, where he spent two years playing in the Third Division, making 69 league appearances. In his second season with the club, their second in the Third Division, Aldershot finished rock-bottom of the league, allowing Sheffield United to buy the player for ¬£50,000 in July 1989. =Sheffield United= Barnes made the step up to Second Division football with Sheffield United, who had just been promoted to the league. He did not look out of place in the higher tier as he helped the Blades to promotion to the First Division at the first time of asking, securing a runners-up spot in the league. He also aided the club in consolidating their position in the top tier as it evolved to become the Premier League. Injuries aside, Barnes was virtually ever-present for two seasons but fell out of favour with manager Dave Bassett who tried unsuccessfully to sell him to Bristol City. Barnes was also unhappy with his playing terms, initially rejecting a new contract in 1992. Having lost his place in the side, he was finally transferred to Watford in January 1994 with the Blades recouping the ¬£50,000 they paid for him. He left Bramall Lane after four-and-a-half years having played 82 league matches and 107 games in all competitions. =Watford= A move to Watford allowed Barnes to make a fresh start in the south, but his time with the club was not fruitful, managing just 16 games over two seasons with the Hornets. Suffering from niggling injuries, a run of five consecutive matches for the club in February to March 1996 was the most Barnes could manage, and he was eventually released in 1996 as Watford were relegated to the Third Division. =Colchester United= Barnes' former Aldershot teammate Steve Wignall brought him to Layer Road in 1996, on a free transfer following his release from Watford in August 1996, making his debut the following day in a 2‚Äì0 home reverse against Hartlepool United. He played eleven times for the U's over the course of eight months, but was unable to shake off a persistent groin injury. Barnes was forced into retirement at the age of 35 in March 1997 when he had his contract cancelled by mutual consent, having played his last professional game in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Mansfield Town on 14 December 1996. International career While with Coventry City, Barnes played for the England under-19 team, featuring in the 1980 UEFA Junior Tournament winning team.

Biography  He was born in Paris into a family of artists and musicians. A gifted and precocious child, he gave his first public performances when he was 5 years old, playing the harpsichord for King Louis XIV of France, and his court. These concerts marked the beginning of Dandrieu's very successful career as harpsichordist and organist. He was a student of Jean-Baptiste Moreau. In 1700, aged 18, he started playing the organ at the Saint-Merri church in Paris (a post previously occupied by Nicolas Leb√®gue) and became its titular organist in 1705. At some point in 1706 he was a member of the panel of judges who examined Jean-Philippe Rameau's skills to appoint him organist of the Sainte-Madeleine en la Cit√© church (incidentally, a post Rameau declined). In 1721 he was appointed one of the four organists of the Chapelle royale of France. In 1733, he succeeded his uncle, the organist and priest Pierre Dandrieu (1664‚Äì1733) to become the organist of the (now destroyed) church of St Barth√©l√©my in the √éle de la Cit√©, a post he combined with duties at Saint-Merri (also known as Saint-M√©d√©ric). He died in Paris in 1739, and was succeeded at the organ of St Barth√©lemy by his sister, Jeanne-Fran√ßoise. The works published during his lifetime include the following collections: *Livre de sonates en trio, trio sonatas (1705) *Two Livres de sonates √† violon seul, sonatas for solo violin (1710 and 1720) *Les caract√®res de la guerre, instrumental concerts (1718, a revised version published in 1733) *Three little harpsichord collections (1705) and three great ones (1724, 1728 and 1734) A volume of organ no√´ls, which revised and enlarged a similar book published by his uncle, Pierre Dandrieu in 1714 (rev. in the 1720s). This was published posthumously by sister, Jeanne-Fran√ßoise, in 1759. Dandrieu also published an academic treatise on accompaniment (Principes de l'accompagnement) in 1718, which now serves as an important source of information on the musical practice of the era. Dandrieu's harpsichord writing is reminiscent of that of Fran√ßois Couperin, but with more effective use of counterpoint, which reminds the listener of German Baroque music. The strict traditional suite \\"√† la Froberger\\" is abandoned in his works, many dance movements replaced with the so-called pi√®ces de caract√®re, pieces with descriptive titles that were common in French music of the 18th century. Dandrieu's harpsichord oeuvre is, after those of Fran√ßois Couperin and Jean- Nicolas Geoffroy, the most important in terms of sheer quantity of pieces.

The Annolied (\\"Song of Anno\\") is an Early Middle High German poem in praise of Archbishop Anno II of Cologne. Anno died in 1075 and the poem, probably written in the years immediately after his death, can be seen as part of a campaign for his canonisation, which was finally achieved in 1183. Source There is no surviving manuscript of the Annolied. Our knowledge of the poem comes mainly from the printed version published by Martin Opitz in 1639. Part of the poem had been published previously by Bonaventura Vulcanius in 1597, but this was only a short extract from the start of the work (strophes 2,1‚Äì5,4)). There are significant differences between the two printed versions: Vulcanius's is missing the prologue, has some additional lines, and differing strophe divisions. The two editors, therefore, must have drawn on different manuscripts, conventionally called *V and *O after their later editors. However, the two manuscripts seem to be closely related and the codex probably combined the Annolied with Williram of Ebersberg's 'Expositio in Cantica Canticorum (\\"Commentary on the Song of Songs\\"): Opitz borrowed a Williram manuscript from his friend Michael Flandrin in Breslau, which may be the one held in the Breslau town library as R 347. The connection between the Annolied and a Williram manuscript in Breslau comes from a 15th century record which notes the presence in the Rhediger collection in the Breslau town library of a codex containing both the Annolied () and Williram's text. A manuscript transcription by Junius now in the Bodleian Library seems to be a copy of Opitz's edition rather than an independent source. Dating The principal point of reference for the dating is the mention of Mainz as the new place of coronation. This may refer to one of two coronations: *Rudolf of Rheinfelden was crowned anti-king in opposition to Henry IV (who had been crowned in Aachen) in Mainz on 15th March 1077. Rudolf was succeeded by Hermann of Salm, who was crowned in Goslar in December 1081. * Henry V was crowned in Mainz in January 1106. Support for the earlier period 1077‚Äì81 comes from evidence that the Gesta Treverorum, which ends in 1106, drew on the Annolied. The Vita Annonis, a Latin life of Anno written in 1105, concentrates more on Anno's miracles, which suggests a later reworking of the story and an earlier date for the Annolied. Content The Annolied was an encomium to Archbishop Anno II of Cologne (d. 1075), later Saint Anno, who was the founder of Siegburg Abbey. The poem consists of three parts: the religious or spiritual history of the world and its salvation, from the creation to the time of Anno II; the secular history of the world up to the foundation of the German cities (including the theory of the world empires derived from the vision of the Book of Daniel); and finally the \\"Vita Annonis\\", or the biography of Archbishop Anno II. A recent interpretation (Dunphy, Herweg) sees this threefold structure in the context of the poet's remark in the prologue that in the beginning God created two worlds, one spiritual and one earthly, and then he mixed these to create the first human, who, being both, was a \\"third world\\". The poem then charts spiritual and secular history and finally shows the two culminating in the biography of the man who stands at the centrepoint of history. This is a remarkable and highly original historiographical approach. Parts of the Annolied were incorporated into the later Middle High German Kaiserchronik and the two works are often considered together. =German origin story= The poem includes sections on four German peoples, the Bavarians, Franks, Saxons and Thuringians, a typical medieval story, telling in each case of their origins in the classical near east. The Annolied is the first text to give what later became quite a popular motif whereby the ancestors of the Bavarians migrated from Armenia.

His parents were born in Virginia and South Carolina, and his family moved to Omaha when Parker was young. He attended Creighton University and later graduated from Harvard University, one of the first African-Americans to do so.Yaacov Shavit, History in Black: African- Americans in Search of an Ancient Past, Routledge, 2001, p.41 As a Black nationalist and contemporary of Marcus Garvey, Parker's views on Africa as the cradle of civilization foreshadowed increased fascination with Egyptian imagery by African-Americans. In 1916 Parker started helping African Americans resettle in Omaha and, by 1917, he helped found the Hamitic League of the World to promote African pride and black economic progress.

He also competed in the high jump at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Early years He was a high jumper who competed at the 1956 Olympic Games (where he was the youngest high jumper) and the 1958 Commonwealth Games for Australia. He had also competed in the Australian Open Track and Field Championships from 1955/56 to 1959/60. Ridgway failed to make the 1960 Australian Olympic team and so accepted an offer of a track and field scholarship to Lamar Tech (now Lamar University). In 1961, he became the first Commonwealth athlete to clear 7 foot in the high jump. Professional career Even though he had never played an official American football game, he was discovered by the Dallas Cowboys and signed as an undrafted free agent to their 1965 team. During the preseason, he played a key role in the beating of the Green Bay Packers. He started the year on the taxi squad, before being promoted to the regular roster on 3 November. It turned out that the running drop-kicks that were commonly used at that time in Aussie rules did not translate well into the American game. He was waived on 24 August 1966, and at the request of the Cowboys, he accepted to play with the Savannah, Georgia, team of the North American Football League, in order to gain more experience. Death Colin Ridgway was murdered at his University Park, Texas, home in 1993. Although Kenneth Bicking Jr. was arrested as a probable suspect in 1996, the case still remains unsolved to date. A man publicly suspected by authorities as a killer-for-hire in Ridgway's murder was convicted 4 September 2014 in Florida of a separate violent crime that happened the year before the murder. Kenneth Alfred Bicking III was found guilty of armed sexual battery and kidnapping with a weapon, according to the Florida State Attorney's office. The maximum sentence is life in prison. Prosecutors said Bicking entered the victim's home in April 1992 without her permission, showed a gun, tied her up and put tape over her eyes and mouth before sexually assaulting her. Bicking was charged after new DNA technology was used in a follow-up investigation in 2011. Police in Dallas theorized that Bicking was hired by his father and Ridgway's widow to carry out the 1993 killing.

Biography Synnot was the son of Richard Synnot. He settled in the parish of Ballymoyer, County Armagh in 1778 and leased eight townlands from the See of Armagh. The family had originally been large landowners in the County of Wexford, but their lands were taken from them by Cromwell, after Colonel David Synnot resisted Cromwell's troops at the Sack of Wexford. The family was involved not only in the linen trade but also owned lead mines in the vicinity. According to Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837): \\"The lands were heathy and barren previously to 1778, when Sir Walter Synnot erected a house and became a resident landlord; scarcely a tree or shrub was to be seen, and the agricultural implements were of the rudest kind. He constructed good roads in the vicinity, planted forest trees to a considerable extent, and by his example and liberal encouragement of every improvement both as to their habitations and system of agriculture, affected a great change in the habits of the peasantry, and in the appearance of the country, which is now in an excellent state of cultivation, yielding abundant produce; the cultivation of green crops has been introduced, and is practised with success.\\" Ballymoyer House was described in the Parliamentary Gazetter of 1844 as follows: \\"The mansion built by Sir Walter Synnot and the demesne attached to it is laid out and planted in a tasteful style. Three mountain streams after debouching from the glens of their upper course, unite in the lawn and form a scene both beautiful and romantic.\\" The Synnot Children (Marcus, Walter and Maria) by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1781 Synnot was appointed High Sheriff of Armagh in 1783 and knighted in May of that year. Marriage and family Synnot married Jane Seton (a descendant of John Seton, 1st Baron Parbroath and a relative of the American Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton and her grandson Monsignor Robert Seton). They had three children, Marcus, Walter and Maria (who died aged 18). These children are featured in the painting by Joseph Wright of Derby, which was formerly at Ballymoyer but is now in the possession of the National Gallery of Victoria. An etching was made in 1782. The second son, Captain Walter Synnot, became a colonist in Van Diemen‚Äôs Land (Tasmania) with his children, including Monckton Synnot and the family were prominent pastoralists in the Colony of Victoria. After the death of Jane Seton, Synnot married Ann Elizabeth (n√©e Martin) and had three more children, including Richard Walter Synnot, a barrister, whose children were the subjects of the portrait by George Richmond. Synnot lived with his new wife and family in Italy for some years and died in Rome in 1821, where he was buried in the same tomb as his daughter Elizabeth (from second wife). His wife's sister Selina Martin wrote Three Years In Italy which covers this period. By 1838 the Synnot family had bought the eight townlands and continued to improve the estate. By the latter part of the 1870s they owned . In 1901 the demesne had passed through marriage to the Hart-Synnot family who presented it to the National Trust in 1937. Ballymoyer house itself was demolished in 1918 as a result of the damage caused by military occupation during the First World War. Ballymoyer estate, is still a National Trust property and is open to the public.

Vehicles appearing in the Original Trilogy  = All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) = The All Terrain Armored Transport, or walker, is a quadruped mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by the Imperial ground forces. Standing over tall with blast-impervious armour plating, these massive constructs are used as much for psychological effect as they are for tactical advantage. The AT-AT (pronounced either casually as 'at at', or using only the letters ) was first introduced in The Empire Strikes Back (as the Galactic Empire's main units against Rebel Alliance infantry during the Battle of Hoth) and also appears in Return of the Jedi (as the vehicle used to transport Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader to their shuttle on the forest moon of Endor) and in Rogue One (in the AT-ACT variant, used to respond to the attacks of Rebel infantrymen of the Rogue One unit during the Battle of Scarif, although later defeated by the arriving Rebel Red Squadron of starfighers). The also appears in a destroyed form in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, explained in the video game Star Wars Battlefront (2015) to be a residue of the Battle of Jakku, which was the Empire's last defeat and resulted in its dissolution. Modified forms appear in The Last Jedi (used by the First Order to attack Resistance forces in a former Rebel base). = All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST) = The All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST) is a two-legged mech walker introduced briefly in The Empire Strikes Back and featured extensively in Return of the Jedi. These vehicles were designed to screen and protect the flanks of slower moving AT-ATs and the larger tanks used by the Empire. Due to their design and movement, they are often dubbed as a \\"chicken walker\\". The name Scout Walker is also used to refer to an . This name was used for the official toy instead of the name. An AT-ST also appears briefly in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, patrolling Jedha City following an attack by Saw Gerrera's forces. A modified AT-ST later appears in The Mandalorian under the possession of a group of raiders, as the Empire has ceased to exist by the time of the series. An updated model of the AT-ST is used by the First Order in The Last Jedi. Shortly before the film's climax, an AT-ST is commandeered by BB-8. = Cloud car = Cloud cars fly around Bespin's Cloud City in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Compositing the cloud cars into the original releases required multiple motion control passes to prevent the vehicles from standing out too distinctly from their cloudy background. Cloud cars were designed to have two cockpits that were interconnected with a small compartment block. It was often a red-orange color with each cockpit arranged in a \\"shoe-shape\\" with the glass being on the \\"tongue\\" of the cockpit. Like the rest of Cloud City, cloud cars were designed to reflect a more refined art deco style. The scale models originally created for the movies were made of plastic parts using the then-new method of vacuum forming.Landry (2019), p. 49 Cloud cars inserted into the films' Special Edition releases were computer-generated. Within the Star Wars universe, these cloud cars (formally identified as Storm IV Twin-Pod models) were built by Bespin Motors specifically as atmospheric patrol craft. The unusual vehicles consist of two separate pods connected together, one for a pilot and the other for a gunner. It can achieve low orbit and attain speeds of thanks to a combination of repulsorlift drive and ion engine. Each pod is armed with a light blaster cannon and protected with armor plating and an armored canopy. While normally the port-side pod houses the pilot and starboard-side houses the gunner, both pods contain all the equipment necessary to fulfill either role in the event one is damaged.Landry (2018), p. 21Barr, et al (2019), p. 332 = Desert Skiff = A pair of skiffs travel with Jabba's sail barge in Return of the Jedi. The skiff was originally conceived as a flying animal carrying strapped-on passenger modules. It was modified to be a nautical-type vehicle, and then transitioned to become more utilitarian. A full-size skiff was built alongside the sail barge in Yuma. An 81-centimeter miniature was also built, and it was \\"crewed\\" by poseable puppets. Skiffs are a common mode of transport on many Star Wars worlds as per in-universe sources, utilizing repulsorlift technology to move cargo and passengers on the cheap. The Bantha II-cargo skiffs seen in Return of the Jedi are also a favorite of various criminal organizations, which use them for raids and prisoner exchanges.

Illustrator Ralph McQuarrie designed the ship to appear more utilitarian in comparison to early designs, which made the ship reminiscent of a Baroque sea craft. Joe Johnston continued working on the design after McQuarrie stepped away from the project. A full-scale sail barge set was erected in Yuma, Arizona; it was one of the largest Star Wars sets created. Measuring 150 feet long, 130 feet wide and 65 feet high, the sail barge set was supported by 130 wooden posts, each 27 feet high, which were deeply embedded into the ground. Underneath the barge were several offices and a commissary which could feed 150 people. In order to get to the set, a two-mile road made of compacted sand was built, requiring roughly 80,000 gallons of water. According to Star Wars references, Jabba's sail barge is named the Khetanna and was built by Ubrikkian Industries as a pleasure barge for the crime lord. At long, it is powered by a repulsorlift engine to reach a maximum speed of but can also use its two sails to slowly travel by air power. While designed purely as a pleasure barge, the Khetanna is fitted with a laser cannon turret and heavy blasters can be mounted on the railings.Landry (2018), p. 54 = Landspeeder = Landspeeders are antigravity vehicles that appear throughout the films and Expanded Universe in both civilian and military roles. They appear in Star Wars: Episode IV ‚Äì A New Hope. = Sandcrawler = C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are briefly held in a Jawa sandcrawler in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Shots of the sandcrawler at a distance were actually a matte painting; only two of its treads and a 27-meter-long piece of its lower structure were actually built. For shots involving the vehicle's movement, ILM used a 125-centimeter radio-controlled model.

The skyhopper model that Skywalker handles in A New Hope is the concept model Colin Cantwell built; budget limitations allowed only a partial full-size mock-up of the craft to be built. In Star Wars: Rebel Assault, skyhoppers are used by Rebel pilots to train in Tatooine's Beggar's canyon. = Snowspeeder (T-47 Airspeeder) = A T-47 airspeeder, better known as \\"snowspeeder\\", is a Rebel Alliance vehicle featured in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and several books, comics, and video games in the Star Wars Expanded Universe and also in Atari game cartridges in the 80's. Snowspeeder models and replicas have been merchandised by several companies. ;Origin and design During production of The Empire Strikes Back, designer Joe Johnston conceived a ship that combined the body of an X-wing and the cockpit of the Y-wing. However, this design was scrapped for the T-47, which featured no elements from previous craft. Johnston's designs for the Snowspeeders have influenced later Star Wars designers, such as Tommy Lee Edwards. The models were built in three different scales by Steve Gawley, Charlie Bailey, and Mike Fulmer of ILM, with the smallest (20 inches) used for motion control photography, and the largest (2¬Ω feet) for hero and pyrotechnic shots. All models included motor-controlled flaps to imply maneuverability, and the largest version also possessed motor- articulated crew Several full-scale props were built in London for the hangar, cockpit, and speeder crash scenes. In the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the First Order uses the Light Infantry Utility Vehicle, also known as \\"LIUV\\" or \\"First Order snowspeeder\\", a landspeeder-like speeder designed for troop transport on the icy Starkiller Base. ;Depiction In The Empire Strikes Back, Rogue Group, led by Commander Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), pilots snowspeeders against Imperial AT-AT walkers during the Battle of Hoth. When their blasters prove ineffective the Rebel pilots turn to tripping the walkers with the snowspeeders' harpoons and tow cables. The snowspeeders used on Hoth are modified Incom T-47 airspeeders initially used for civilians; they are modified to survive the \\"hostile environment of the ice planet Hoth\\". Expanded Universe material states that the Y-wing cockpit and other features were donated to the airspeeders. The two-man craft has an advanced power system and repulsorlift to compensate for additional armaments and armor, affording them a top speed of 1,000 km/h and combat speed of 600 km/h. The playable snowspeeder in Star Wars: Battlefront II is armed with concussion missiles and small tow-cable launcher. ;Merchandise Kenner released a toy snowspeeder in 1980. Kenner re-released an updated version utilizing the same mold in 1995 for their new 'Power of the Force' line. After Hasbro shut down the Kenner offices in 1999, it was released several times under Hasbro's brand name: in 2001 as a Wal-Mart exclusive in the \\"Power of the Jedi\\" collection, in 2006 as a Target exclusive in the \\"Saga Collection\\" line, and three versions of it in the 2010 \\"The Vintage Collection\\", including a Target exclusive packaged as the original 1980 Kenner version. LEGO has also sold snowspeeder models, and Snowspeeder models used in The Empire Strikes Back have been sold online. Hasbro's Star Wars Transformers line included a Snowspeeder that transformed into Luke Skywalker. In 2009, Japanese model manufacturer Fine Molds released a 1/48 scale kit of the Snowspeeder. = Speeder bike = Speeder bikes first appear in a chase scene in Return of the Jedi and have appeared in various other Star Wars media. Related vehicles called 'swoop bikes' have also appeared in Star Wars films and other media.  Vehicles appearing in the Prequel Trilogy  = Armored Assault Tank (AAT) = The AAT is a Trade Federation vehicle that appears in The Phantom Menace, Revenge of the Sith, and other Star Wars media. Early drafts of The Phantom Menace described the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo being led by \\"armored attack craft\\" that resembled helicopters. George Lucas narrowed down the AAT's design after looking at two different drawings from ILM design director Doug Chiang - one tank-like and the other shaped like a flying spade - and deciding it would be interesting to combine the two together. The final version's forward curve is based on the curve of a shovel, and parts of it are intended to suggest animalistic traits. LEGO released an AAT model in 2001. The AAT is a battle tank that floats above the ground thanks to anti-gravity \\"repulsorlift\\" technology and can achieve a top speed of . At long, the AAT is crewed by four battle droids: a commander, a pilot and two gunners. It is heavily armed with a primary turret-mounted heavy laser cannon and matching pairs of anti-personnel laser cannons, laser rangefinders, and short-ranged blaster cannons that extend out on either side. The base of the tank also incorporates six energized projectile launchers which can fire a variety of ordnance including armor-piercing warheads or high-explosive \\"bunker-busting\\" shells. = Bongo Submarine = The Gungan \\"bongo\\" submarine is a transport in The Phantom Menace. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) use a bongo to travel from the underwater city of Otah Gunga to the Naboo capital of Theed. Industrial Light & Magic's Doug Chiang devised the submarine's squid-like propeller design. This assembly was then merged with the design for a manta-shaped underwater transport written out of an earlier draft of the story. This design replaced earlier concepts that depicted the Gungan vessel as an organic-looking diving bell. Practical and CGI models of the Gungan vessel were built, as well as a full-size set for the actors to work in.Landry (2019), p. 75 Within the Star Wars universe, the Bongo is described as being organically grown by secret Gungan techniques and so no two are exactly alike. The submersible piloted by Jar-Jar, Obi-Wan and Qua-Gon was a Tribubble bongo long and manufactured by the Otoh Gunga Bongmeken Cooperative. It used hydrostatic bubble shields to keep the cockpit and cargo areas dry and filled with air. The cluster of semi- rigid electromotive tentacles at the submersible's rear could propel it to a top speed of . It was unarmed but in an emergency the cockpit section could detach from the rest of the submersible as an escape pod.Landry (2018), p. 79 = Clone turbo tank (HAVw A6 Juggernaut) = The turbo tank is a ten-wheeled battle tank and armored personnel carrier that appears in Revenge of the Sith and is based on designs done by Joe Johnston for use in The Empire Strikes Back. West End Games based their \\"HAVw A5 Juggernaut\\" design on Johnson's sketches. The larger, more heavily armed vehicle that appears in Revenge of the Sith is labeled \\"HAVw A6\\". The clone turbo tank, more formally the HAVw A6 Juggernaut, is described in Star Wars sources as being built by Kuat Drive Yards to serve as a heavily armed and armored military transport for the Republic during the Clone Wars. At long, the massive tank can carry as many as 300 clone troopers into battle at a maximum speed of , protected by superconductive armor and carried on massive wheels designed absorb enemy fire and roll over any terrain. A crew of 12 operates the Juggernaut and can control it from cockpits located at either end of the tank. For weaponry it is equipped with a heavy laser turret, a repeating laser turret, two antipersonnel laser cannons, and two projectile launchers.Walker (2018), p. 193Barr, et al. (2019), p. 311 After the end of the Clone Wars, the tank continues to serve the Galactic Empire. A later model, the HCVw A9, appears in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story being used as a prisoner transport carrying Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones). = Corporate Alliance tank droid = Corporate Alliance tank droids appear in Revenge of the Sith and have appeared in other Star Wars media, including as playable vehicles in Battlefront II. This \\"snail droid\\" was originally designed for Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones for the climatic Battle of Geonosis, but they did not make it into the final cut of the film. Formally identified in background material as the NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer, these tanks are manufactured by the Techno Union and primarily used by the Corporate Alliance, which sides with the Separatists during the Clone Wars. This -long tank is designed to function on its own with a built-in droid brain, though it can also be controlled by a pilot battle droid. Consisting of a huge central tread and forward-mounted outriggers, the tank droid can cross almost any terrain with ease and achieve a top speed of . Its weaponry includes two heavy repeating blasters, two ion cannons, and missile launchers.Walker (2018), p. 69Barr, et al. (2019), p. 305 = Dwarf spider droid = The Dwarf spider droid is first seen being used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems in Attack of the Clones during the Battle of Geonosis and have featured in other Star Wars media. Hasbro released a spider droid figure in 2003. The DSD1 dwarf spider droid, as it is identified in background material, is essentially a walking cannon with a droid brain, built by the Baktoid Armor Workshop to fight for the Separatists during the Clone Wars. Standing only tall, it is also known as the burrowing spider droid for its ability to fit in tight spaces. It's primary weapon is a long blaster cannon capable of firing at different intensities and rates of fire, though it can also willingly utilize a self-destruct device to blow up the enemy. A pair of infrared photoreceptors on the armored brain casing allow the spider droid to see its surroundings while four articulated legs are designed to affix to the sides of cliffs so it may climb difficult terrain. It can achieve a maximum speed of .Walker (2018), p. 57Barr, et al. (2019), p. 311Barr, et al. (2017), p. 130-131 = HMP Droid gunship = Droid gunships appear at the Battle of Kashyyyk in Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Battlefront II. Their circular shape is designed to be reminiscent of the Trade Federation ships seen in The Phantom Menace. These ships were originally intended to appear in the movie's opening space battle, but were ultimately depicted as aircraft. Described by in-universe material as the Separatist counterpart to the Republic's LAAT, the Heavy Missile Platform droid gunship (or HMP Predator) is a heavily armed repulsorlift airspeeder which can be adapted for a wide range of mission profiles. Controlled by an advanced droid brain, the gunship is long and can achieve a top speed of . Its weaponry can be changed out depending on what's needed, but standard armament includes a chin-mounted laser cannon, two twin laser cannon turrets, wingtip-mounted light laser cannons, and fourteen high explosive missiles. The gunships can also be modified to serve as troop carriers for battle droids.Walker (2018), p. 16Barr, et al. (2019), p. 308 = Flash speeder = The Naboo Royal Security Forces use Flash speeders in The Phantom Menace. = Gian speeder = The Naboo Royal Security Forces use Gian speeders in The Phantom Menace. They are larger, heavier counterparts to the NRSF Flash Speeders, and are used mainly for skirmishes against pirates and smugglers. However, they are still modified civilian landspeeeders, and prove relatively useless against Trade Federation tanks. They are painted purple, carry one medium blaster cannon, and have seating for four NRSF officers. They also have light armour plating for protection against hand-held blasters, but there is little protection for the vehicles occupants. = Hailfire droid tank = Hailfire droids are mobile missile platforms that appear in Attack of the Clones during the Battle of Geonosis and have featured in other Star Wars media associated with the Clone Wars. In-universe material identifies them as IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks produced by Haor Chall Engineering and commissioned for the InterGalactic Banking Clan prior to the Clone Wars to assist with debt collection. Standing tall and capable of , they consist of two large wheels with a low-fixed base on which is mounted a targeting photoreceptor, twin chin-mounted blaster cannons, and two missile launchers. Each launcher can carry up to 15 missiles, which have an effective range of less than one kilometre following deliberately evasive trajectories to their target. Although an effective platform against both ground and air targets, the Hailfire was phased out during the Clone Wars because of its limited ammunition supply.Walker (2018), p. 68Barr, et al. (2019), p. 303Lund, et al. (2016), p. 93 = Homing spider droid = The OG-9 homing spider droid appears in Attack of the Clones during the Battle of Geonosis and features in other Star Wars media, including as a playable vehicle in Battlefront II. During post-production, the droid was referred to as \\"Commerce Guild droid B.\\" Referred to in source material as the OG-9 homing spider droid, these droid walking tanks were manufactured by Baktoid Armor Workshop for the Commerce Guild to enforce their contracts. It consists of an armored reactor core body attached to four armored legs, giving it a height of . While the legs are thin they are tougher than they look, allowing the droid to traverse nearly any terrain and achieve a top speed of . Its primary weapons are two dish-shaped laser cannons mounted on the top and bottom of the reactor core: the top- mounted cannon primarily releases sustains bursts to wear down deflector shields, while the bottom cannon suppresses enemy infantry.Walker (2018), p. 56Barr, et al. (2019), p. 301 = Multi-troop transport (MTT) = The Multi- Troop Transports or MTTs made their first appearance in The Phantom Menace, carrying and deploying Trade Federation battle droids during the invasion of Naboo. As with the AAT, parts of the MTT are intended to suggest animalistic traits. Lucas requested the MTT have locomotive-type qualities and be capable of knocking down everything in its path; consequently, the MTT has battering rams and locomotive components. Although the MTT was primarily created using computer-generated imagery (CGI), a scale model was also built to film certain scenes of The Phantom Menace, combining elements of practical and digital special effects.Landry (2019), p. 72 Fictional background for the MTT explains it was originally produced by Baktoid Armor Workshop, the same manufacturer of the Trade Federation's AAT. Although floating above the ground on heavy-duty \\"repulsorlift\\" engines, the MTT is a lumbering vehicle with a top speed of only . It is armed with a pair of twin blaster cannons, but its primary purpose is to carry 112 battle droids into battle. These are stored folded-up on an articulated deployment rack, which extends forward out of the MTT's bulbous front end via troop deployment hatch.Landry (2018), p. 46Barr, et. al. (2019), p. 293 = Podracer = Podracers are high-speed one-man race craft. Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) enters and wins a podrace in The Phantom Menace. It consists of forward turbines attached loosely to the cockpit by a series of cables with the turbines attached to each other by an ion beam. It was frequently gambled upon and was considered by many, including Qui-Gon Jinn, to be a dangerous sport. The video games Star Wars Episode I: Racer, Star Wars: Racer Arcade and Star Wars Racer Revenge are based on The Phantom Menace's podracing scenes. = Republic assault gunboat = The Republic assault gunboat appears in Revenge of the Sith. The vehicle went through several changes over the course of its development: it was originally a Confederacy capital ship, then became the \\"Good Guy A\\" support ship for the Republic. It became a Confederacy ship once more before being scaled down, turned into a speeder, and becoming a Republic craft. = Republic LAAT Gunship = The Low- Altitude Assault Transports (LAATs) are Galactic Republic airborne attack transport and multirole-ground attack gunships that appears in Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars: Battlefront, and Star Wars: Republic Commando, ferrying clone troopers, Jedi, and military hardware during battle. The Expanded Universe describes the LAAT as a versatile multi-role aerospace crafts capable of reconfigured for the gunship, transport, starfighter, and bomber combat roles. There are numerous LAAT variants: the LAAT/i infantry transport, the LAAT/c cargo carrier, the LAAT/s stealth special forces, the LAAT/le law enforcement for military police, and LAAT/v vehicle tactical airlift that carried AT-TEs. Lucas turned to footage of helicopter-troop deployment when conceiving the LAAT; the vehicle was originally labeled the \\"Jedi attack helicopter\\". The vehicle's ultimate appearance is based on the Russian Mil Mi-24 helicopter. The craft's engine sounds are the modified sound of a Vickers Vimy, a World War I bomber. Both Hasbro and Lego released LAAT models in 2002; Lego released another LAAT in 2008. Code 3 Collectibles released a die-cast gunship two years later. Within the Star Wars universe, these repulsorlift gunships were built by Rothana Heavy Engineering to serve a vital role as atmospheric transports and escorts for the Republic during the Clone Wars. The standard LAAT/i gunship (Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry) can carry 30 clone troopers at a maximum air speed of . Its weaponry consist of three laser cannons on swivel turrets, two mounted on the nose and one in the rear; two beam cannons on ball turrets that extend from the side; two additional beam cannon turrets mounted on the wings; and a pair of missile launchers. The LAAT/i is crewed by a pilot, forward gunner, and ball turret gunners. Another variant, the LAAT/c (Low Altitude Assault Transport/carrier), is crewed by a single pilot and armed with just the nose-mounted cannons, but features a pair of magnetic clamps that can quickly ferry cargo or AT-TEs into battle.Walker (2018), p. 17 Barr, et al. (2019), p. 302-303 = Self-propelled heavy artillery (SPHA) = Self-propelled heavy artillery first appear in Attack of the Clones during the Battle of Geonosis. The vehicle was initially design on treads, but George Lucas suggested that it be equipped with legs like the AT-TEs that fight alongside it. The SPHA was referred to as \\"Clone Tank A\\" during production. Source material identifies the SPHA as one of the biggest ground guns in the Republic's arsenals during the Clone Wars, operated by a crew of 30 clone troopers. At long, the SPHA is slow but steady, reaching speeds of up to on 12 articulate legs though it must remain stationary to fire its weapon. The SPHA-T is armed with a heavy turbolaser cannon powerful enough to destroy a starship, though firing it requires vast amounts of energy which can quickly drain the SPHA-T.Walker (2018), p. 58 = Single Trooper Aerial Platform (STAP) = STAPs, which first appeared in The Phantom Menace and have featured in other Star Wars media, are designed to appear reminiscent of the speeder bikes seen in Return of the Jedi. The STAP's design also relates back to Lucas' 1973 idea of ridable \\"jet-sticks\\" which appeared in early drafts of the original Star Wars movie.Walker (2018), p. 72 A draft of The Phantom Menace refers to the vehicles as STAPS, or Single Troop Armed Pogo Sticks. These lightweight reconnaissance vehicles are based in-universe on civilian vehicles called airhooks, modified for greater performance and to be piloted by the Trade Federation's battle droids. Floating above the ground thanks to \\"repulsorlift\\" technology, a pair of drive turbines on either side of the vertical stem gives it impressive speed and maneuverability. Though armed with a pair of blaster cannons, the STAP leaves its pilot completely exposed, making it ill-suit for heavy battle. = Swamp speeder = Swamp speeders appear in Revenge of the Sith during battle scenes on Felucia and Kashyyyk. TJ Frame, who worked on the swamp speeder concept soon after joining the art department, initially designed the craft to be appear reminiscent of fanboats. Within the Star Wars universe these vehicles are known as Infantry Support Platform (ISP) speeders, built for the Republic during the Clone Wars by Uulshos Manufacturing. ISPs use repulsorlifts and a powerful turbofan to patrol swampy regions, leading to their nickname, although they can be used on almost any terrain. Operated by two clone troopers and armed with a pair of twin swiveling blaster cannons, the ISP can move at speeds of up to .Walker (2018), p. 58 = Wheel bike = General Grievous rides a wheel bike in Revenge of the Sith during his confrontation with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). Grievous' vehicle is similar to another wheel bike that appears in the Star Wars: Droids cartoon. One concept for Grievous' vehicle was for it to include \\"tank-like chariots\\"; at another point, the vehicle was going to be another droid. Grievous' wheel bike is identified in Star Wars source material as a TSMEU-6 personal wheel bike built by the Z-Gomot Ternbuell Guppat Corporation. Wheel bikes are described as being primarily used during mining operations, however they are also popular as modified weapons platforms on the second-hand market. The TSMEU-6 is long with a wheel diameter of and four retractable legs for navigating difficult terrain. With the legs retracted the wheel bike has a maximum speed of , while in walking mode the bike can only attain . Overall the bike has enough fuel to travel . While normally carrying a driver and passenger, Grevious' bike has had the passenger seat replaced with a heavy double laser cannon; both seat and cannon remain stable while the wheel rotates around them.Walker (2018), p. 70 Barr, et al. (2019), p. 310 = Wookiee flying catamaran = Wookiee flying catamarans appear in Revenge of the Sith. They were originally conceived as strictly water vehicles. The addition of a rotor came late in production; some printed works do not depict this component. = Wookiee ornithopter = Wookiee ornithopters appear in Revenge of the Sith. The craft was originally known as the \\"dragonfly helicopter\\". Although mostly depicted through computer-generated imagery, a full-size mockup of the gunner's seat was created for a closeup of the tail gunner.

On 23 March 1994, the aircraft operating the route, an Airbus A310-304 flown by Aeroflot ‚Äì Russian International Airlines, crashed into a mountain range in Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, killing all 63 passengers and 12 crew members on board. No evidence of a technical malfunction was found. Cockpit voice and flight data recorders revealed the presence of the relief pilot's 12-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son on the flight deck. While seated at the controls, the pilot's son had unknowingly disengaged the A310's autopilot control of the aircraft's ailerons. The autopilot then disengaged completely, causing the aircraft to roll into a steep bank and a near-vertical dive. Despite managing to level the aircraft, the first officer over-corrected when pulling up, causing the plane to stall and enter into a spin; the pilots managed to level the aircraft off once more, but by then, the plane had lost too much altitude to recover and crashed into the Kuznetsk Alatau mountain range. Background =Aircraft= The aircraft involved in the accident was a leased Airbus A310-304, registration , serial number 596, that was delivered new to Aeroflot on 11 December 1992. Powered with two General Electric CF6-80C2A2 engines, the airframe had its maiden flight as on 11 September 1991, and was one of five operating for Russian Airlines, an autonomous division of Aeroflot ‚Äì Russian International Airlines that was set up for serving routes to the Russian Far East and Southeast Asia. On average, the crew of three operating the aircraft had logged 900 hours on the type. =Passengers and crew= Of the 63 passengers on board, 40 were Russian nationals, including about 30 airline employees and family members. The remaining 23 foreigners were mostly businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan who were looking for economic opportunities in Russia. The captain of Flight 593 was Andrey Viktorovich Danilov, 40, who was hired by Aeroflot in November 1992. He had accrued over 9,675 hours of flight time, including 950 hours in the A310, of which 895 hours were as captain. The first officer was Igor Vasilyevich Piskaryov, 33, hired by Aeroflot in October 1993, who had 5,885 hours of flight time, including 440 hours in the A310. The relief pilot was Yaroslav Vladimirovich Kudrinsky, 39, who was hired by Aeroflot in November 1992; he had over 8,940 flying hours, including 907 hours in the A310. Kudrinsky also had experience in the Yakovlev Yak-40, Antonov An-12, and Ilyushin Il-76. Nine flight attendants were on board the plane. Accident On 23 March 1994, the jet aircraft was en route from Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow to Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, with 75 occupants aboard, of whom 63 were passengers. Relief pilot Kudrinsky was taking his two children on their first international flight, and they were brought to the cockpit while he was on duty. Five people were thus on the flight deck: Kudrinsky, co-pilot Piskaryov, Kudrinsky's children Eldar and Yana, and another pilot, Vladimir Makarov, who was flying as a passenger.Official accident investigation report (Russian) With the autopilot active, Kudrinsky, against regulations, let the children sit at the controls. First, his daughter Yana took the pilot's left front seat. Kudrinsky adjusted the autopilot's heading to give her the impression that she was turning the plane, though she actually had no control of the aircraft. Shortly thereafter, Kudrinsky's son Eldar occupied the pilot's seat. Unlike his sister, Eldar applied enough force to the control column to contradict the autopilot for 30 seconds. This caused the flight computer to switch the plane's ailerons to manual control, while maintaining control over the other flight systems. A silent indicator light came on to alert the pilots to this partial disengagement. The pilots, who had previously flown Soviet- designed planes that had audible warning signals, apparently failed to notice it. Eldar was the first to notice a problem, when he observed that the plane was banking right. Shortly after, the flight path indicator changed to show the new flight path of the aircraft as it turned. Since the turn was continuous, the resulting predicted flight path drawn on screen was a 180¬∞ turn. This indication is similar to those shown when in a holding pattern, where a 180¬∞ turn is required to remain in a stable position. This confused the pilots for nine seconds, during which time the plane banked past a 45¬∞ angle to almost 90¬∞, steeper than the design allowed. The A310 cannot turn this steeply while maintaining altitude, and the plane started to descend quickly. The increased g-forces on the pilots and crew made regaining control extremely difficult for them. The autopilot, which no longer controlled the ailerons, used its other controls to compensate, pitching the nose up and increasing thrust. As a result, the plane began to stall; the autopilot, unable to cope, disengaged completely. A second, larger indicator light came on to alert the pilots of the complete disengagement, and this time they did notice it. At the same time, the autopilot's display screen went blank. To recover from the stall, an automatic system lowered the nose and put the plane into a nosedive. The reduced g-forces enabled Kudrinsky to retake his seat. Piskaryov then managed to pull out of the dive, but over-corrected, putting the plane in an almost vertical ascent, again stalling the plane, which fell out of the sky into a corkscrew dive. Although Kudrinsky and Piskaryov regained control and leveled out the wings, they did not know how far they had descended during the crisis and their altitude by then was too low to recover. The plane crashed at high vertical speed, estimated at . All 75 occupants died on impact. The aircraft crashed with its landing gear up, and all passengers had been prepared for an emergency, as they were strapped into their seats. No distress calls were made prior to the crash. Despite the struggles of both pilots to save the aircraft, it was later concluded that if they had just let go of the control column, the autopilot would have automatically taken action to prevent stalling, thus avoiding the accident. The wreckage was located on a remote hillside in the Kuznetsk Alatau mountain chain, about east of Mezhdurechensk, Kemerovo Oblast, Russia; the flight data recorders were found on the second day of searching. Families of western victims placed flowers on the crash site, while families of Chinese victims scattered pieces of paper with messages written on them around the crash site. The airline originally denied that the children were in the cockpit, but accepted the fact when the Moscow-based magazine Obozrevatel (, ) published the transcript on the week of 28 September 1994. The Associated Press said, according to the transcript, \\"the Russian crew almost succeeded in saving the plane\\". The New York Times said, \\"A transcript of the tape printed in the magazine Obozrevatel shows that the Russian crew nearly managed to save the Airbus plane and the 75 people on board, but that it was hampered by the presence of children and its unfamiliarity with the foreign-made plane.\\" The New York Times also stated that an analysis by an aviation expert published in Rossiiskiye Vesti (, ) supported that analysis. In popular culture The events of Flight 593 were featured in \\"Kid in the Cockpit\\", a season-three (2005) episode of the Canadian TV series Mayday (called Air Emergency and Air Disasters in the U.S. and Air Crash Investigation in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The flight was also included in a Mayday season six (2007) Science of Disaster special titled \\"Who's Flying the Plane?\\" Michael Crichton's novel Airframe, published in 1996, draws on events from the accidents of Aeroflot 593 and China Eastern Airlines Flight 583.

The distinguishing feature of a push-pull converter is that the transformer primary is supplied with current from the input line by pairs of transistors in a symmetrical push-pull circuit. The transistors are alternately switched on and off, periodically reversing the current in the transformer. Therefore, current is drawn from the line during both halves of the switching cycle. This contrasts with buck-boost converters, in which the input current is supplied by a single transistor which is switched on and off, so current is only drawn from the line during half the switching cycle. During the other half the output power is supplied by energy stored in inductors or capacitors in the power supply. Push‚Äìpull converters have steadier input current, create less noise on the input line, and are more efficient in higher power applications. Circuit operation Full-bridge converter circuit diagram Conceptual schematic of a full-bridge converter. This is not a center tapped or split primary push-pull converter. Top: Simple inverter circuit shown with an electromechanical switch and automatic equivalent auto-switching device implemented with two transistors and split winding auto- transformer in place of the mechanical switch. The term push‚Äìpull is sometimes used to generally refer to any converter with bidirectional excitation of the transformer. For example, in a full-bridge converter, the switches (connected as an H-bridge) alternate the voltage across the supply side of the transformer, causing the transformer to function as it would for AC power and produce a voltage on its output side. However, push‚Äìpull more commonly refers to a two-switch topology with a split primary winding. In any case, the output is then rectified and sent to the load. Capacitors are often included at the output to filter the switching noise. In practice, it is necessary to allow a small interval between powering the transformer one way and powering it the other: the ‚Äúswitches‚Äù are usually pairs of transistors (or similar devices), and were the two transistors in the pair to switch simultaneously there would be a risk of shorting out the power supply. Hence, a small wait is needed to avoid this problem. This wait time is called \\"Dead Time\\" and is necessary to avoid transistor shoot-through.  Transistors  N-type and P-type power transistors can be used. Power MOSFETs are often chosen for this role due to their high current switching capability and their inherently low ON resistance. The gates or bases of the power transistors are tied via a resistor to one of the supply voltages. A P-type transistor is used to pull up the N-type power transistor gate (common source) and an N-type transistor is used to pull down the P-type power transistor gate. Alternatively, all power transistors can be N-type, which offer around three times the gain of their P-type equivalents. In this alternative the N-type transistor used in place of the P-type has to be driven in this way: The voltage is amplified by one P-type transistor and one N-type transistor in common base configuration to rail-to-rail amplitude. Then the power transistor is driven in common drain configuration to amplify the current. In high frequency applications both transistors are driven with common source. The operation of the circuit means that both transistors are actually pushing, and the pulling is done by a low pass filter in general, and by a center tap of the transformer in the converter application. But because the transistors push in an alternating fashion, the device is called a push-pull converter.  Timing  If both transistors are in their on state, a short circuit results. On the other hand, if both transistors are in their off state, high voltage peaks appear due to back EMF. If the driver for the transistors is powerful and fast enough, the back EMF has no time to charge the capacity of the windings and of the body- diode of the MOSFETs to high voltages. If a microcontroller is used, it can be used to measure the peak voltage and digitally adjust the timing for the transistors, so that the peak only just appears. This is especially useful when the transistors are starting from cold with no peaks, and are in their boot phase. The cycle starts with no voltage and no current. Then one transistor turns on, a constant voltage is applied to the primary, current increases linearly, and a constant voltage is induced in the secondary. After some time T the transistor is turned off, the parasitic capacities of the transistors and the transformer and the inductance of the transformer form an LC circuit which swings to the opposite polarity. Then the other transistor turns on. For the same time T charge flows back into the storage capacitor, then changes the direction automatically, and for another time T the charge flows in the transformer. Then again the first transistor turns on until the current is stopped. Then the cycle is finished, another cycle can start anytime later. The S-shaped current is needed to improve over the simpler converters and deal efficiently with remanence.

Unitary enterprises are business entities that have no ownership rights to the assets that they use in their operations. This form is possible only for state and municipal enterprises, which respectively operate state or municipal property. The owners of the property of a unitary enterprise have no responsibility for its operation and vice versa. Russia Federal Law No. 161-–§–ó \\"On State and Municipal Unitary Enterprises\\" (amended July 13, 2015), defines the legal status of unitary enterprises in Russia. The State Duma passed this law on October 11, 2002, and President Putin signed it on November 14, 2002. The assets of unitary enterprises belong to the federal government, to a Russian federal subject, or to a municipality. A unitary enterprise holds assets under economic management (for both state and municipal unitary enterprises) or under operative management (for state unitary enterprises only), but has limited property rights over the assets. The term \\"unitary\\" specifies the assets as indivisible, i.e., they may not be distributed among the participants in any way. Property granted to a unitary enterprise can be sold or otherwise alienated only with the consent of the state or municipal property owner. The existence of unitary enterprises is a legacy of the Soviet era, when the state owned the means of production. The managers of state enterprises often have close ties to the state agencies which established them, a situation that can lead to legal and political problems. A unitary enterprise is independent in economic issues and obliged only to give its profits to the state. Unitary enterprises have no right to set up subsidiaries, but they can, with the owner's consent, open branches and representation offices. Though government entities own the unitary enterprises, the enterprises themselves work on the basis of commercial accounts and of commercial legislation. They come under ministerial responsibility but are off-budget. They may be auxiliary to a ministry's activity, such as a printing house under the Ministry of Education or a production facility for police equipment under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Unitary enterprises have a distinct legal status, different from regular market-sector corporations. Some of the largest federal state unitary enterprises include Russian Post, and All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, while large non-federal unitary enterprises include Moscow Metro, Mosgortrans and Saint Petersburg Metro.

The disaster happened when a series of explosions caused by firedamp ripped through the workings. It is the worst mining accident in England and the second worst mining disaster in the United Kingdom, after the Senghenydd colliery disaster in Wales. Oaks Colliery The first shaft at the Oaks Colliery was sunk in the early 1830s. In 1845 two separate explosions occurred at the colliery. On both occasions few men were below ground and no more than three or four workers died. Two years later a more serious incident occurred after firedamp, accumulated in old workings, was ignited and exploded. Of the men underground, 73 were killed and 26 were rescued. Changes were then made to the colliery's ventilation. The downcast shaft was converted to upcast with a furnace at its foot. Two abandoned shafts were deepened to the lower seams and brought into use as the downcast and drawing shafts. The upcast shaft was close to the Dearne and Dove Canal and the downcast shafts were adjacent to the railway. The colliery covered about of which two thirds had been worked out. It was worked on the longwall principle, there being about of wall at the time of the 1866 explosion. The Barnsley seam is about thick. It is below the surface at the pit bottom, but dips significantly so that it reaches . The Barnsley seam was liable to outbursts of firedamp, sometimes sufficient to put out the Geordie lamps used. On one occasion all the lamps for were put out. Gas built up in the uneven levels and the goaves were full of firedamp. The air circuit was more than long. The induced draught was obtained from a pair of furnaces from the upcast shaft. At the inquiry after the explosion, it transpired that the colliery had not been visited by government inspectors for some years. The Oaks Colliery workings became part of Barnsley Main Colliery which closed and re-opened several times between 1929 and 1966. Linked underground to Barrow Colliery, the No.2 shaft was used for man-riding in the 1970s. Production ceased at Barnsley Main in 1991. The colliery's winding engine house and pit head structures are Grade II listed buildings. They are a rare survival of winding shaft structures modernised in the 1950s by the National Coal Board and preserve the historical connection to disaster. Background The Oaks was considered to be one of the most dangerous pits in South Yorkshire and the workers were concerned for their own safety. Large emissions of firedamp were commonplace. Ten years earlier the 400-strong workforce went on strike for ten weeks because of alleged management incompetence but had to resume work when starvation loomed. During a bitter dispute in 1864, blackleg labour was used and striking miners and their families were evicted from their homes. Gas made men giddy and faint. Men would not take safety lamps near the goaves. According to Tomlinson the underviewers had chalked \\"FIRE\\" in places. Parkin Jeffcock, the mining engineer who attended after the explosion, agreed that the fireman had written \\"FIRE\\" but said it was not unusual. In a meeting with the management at the beginning of December, the men complained about a weakness in the pit's ventilation. To improve the ventilation and alleviate the problem of gas issuing from the seam, a drift through the rock was blasted from near the pit bottom towards the more remote workings. The drift was expected to be finished that day. Explosion On Wednesday 12 December 1866, 340 men and boys were underground, 131 hewers who cut the coal, hurriers who moved the coal to the shaft bottom, horse-drivers, maintenance staff and trappers, boys who were employed to open and close ventilation doors to allow wagons to pass. At 1:20 pm with less than an hour of the shift remaining, an explosion ripped through the workings. The whole neighbourhood for three miles around shook as if an earthquake had occurred accompanied by a huge roar like thunder. Two dense columns of smoke and debris erupted from the downcast shafts. At No. 1 pit the blast damaged the winding engine and broke the cage, disconnecting it from its rope. At No. 2 pit the cage was blown up into the headgear breaking a coupling. After about five minutes the ventilation resumed and fresh air was drawn back the downcast pits. Rescue attempts, day one Another cage was attached to the rope in the No. 1 pit. Dymond, the colliery owner, Tewart, the underviewer and Siddons, a deputy, descended first. They found 20 badly burned casualties who were quickly sent up but 14 subsequently died of their injuries. After another rope was attached, Cooper, John Brown, Maddison, Potter, Kelly, Platts, Minto, the under-viewer from Mount Osborne Colliery, and other engineers and deputies from surrounding collieries went down. By 4pm another 61 bodies had been retrieved. The few survivors had made their way to the shaft bottom where there was some air; those in more distant areas succumbed to the afterdamp, principally carbon monoxide. The dead were taken to their homes. At the time of the explosion the only rescuers were volunteers and officials who came from neighbouring collieries who worked in relays. Sixteen men forced to the surface because of the foul air were accused of cowardice by bystanders. The few police present could not control the crowd, which invaded the pithead and interfered with operations. A telegram to the Chief Constable brought reinforcements and the area was cleared. A message was sent to colliery engineer Thomas Woodhouse of Duffield near Derby. It said, \\"The Oaks Pit is on fire. Come directly.\\" Woodhouse was in London but his partner, Parkin Jeffcock, responded and arrived by train before 10 pm. The rescuers' progress was restricted because of roof falls and afterdamp. Where it was possible to penetrate further into the workings bodies were found damaged by the blast. During the day the rope and cage for the No. 1 shaft were repaired and brattice was sent down to repair the stoppings. Jeffcock descended into the pit at 10 pm and met Minto and Brown, Potter, Cooper and Platts underground. Jeffcock took charge of the operation to make the pit safe and restore ventilation. Minto was an under-viewer at the Oaks before becoming the engineer for two nearby collieries. At 1.30a.m. most of the men below ground came up and Minto with Mr Smith (the mining engineer from Lundhill Colliery) went below. Minto met up with Tewart and following his directions went to the end of the stone drift where he met up with Jeffcock. Dymond and Brown who were supervising operations realised before the end of the first day that all the remaining men must be dead and from midnight underground operations were run down. Recovery attempts, day two Parkin Jeffcock Jeffcock and Minto walked up the engine level checking stoppings. Part way up they encountered a strong blower of chokedamp (mainly carbon dioxide and nitrogen) which accounted for much of the foul air. Just after 5 am Minto ascended to select and organise a party of about a hundred men to recover the bodies. Jeffcock remained below trying to re-establish effective ventilation. The rescuers were led by Smith, David Tewert the underground steward, William Sugden, deputy steward, Charles Siddon, under deputy, and two firemen Thomas Madin and William Stevenson. Hague was underground at 8.30 am the following morning working with Sugden in charge of a party of men about from the pit bottom. The air stream rapidly changed direction, a sure sign of an explosion and the men rushed to the pit bottom. All the men except Sugden were lifted out in six trips of the cage. Fifteen men were in the cage which usually carried six. At the inquest Hague described it: \\"I found the air turned upon us, and we 'revolted' again. That is, we were sucked backwards and forwards in consequence of the explosion. I knew this, for I am one of the survivors of the explosion twenty years ago.\\" Minto descended to find out what was happening. He asked Tewart where Jeffcock and Smith were and after a brief search spent five minutes talking with Tewart, Baker and Siddons. He regained the surface at ten to nine. Jeffcock had earlier sent word that he thought the mine was heating up and advised that the shaft temperature be monitored. A thermometer was lowered to check when the second explosion occurred at five to nine. The men were thrown backwards, No. 1 cage was blasted into the headgear, dense clouds of smoke were emitted and large burning timbers were hurled into the air. This was a larger explosion than the first. A cage was lowered and shortly after raised but returned empty. It was apparent that everyone below ground was dead and little could be done to recover the bodies. At 7.40 pm in the evening, a third explosion sent black smoke bellowing from No. 2 pit, the downcast shaft. The pit head was considered to be unsafe and spectators were moved to a safe distance. The 28 explorers led by Jeffcock were presumed dead. Meanwhile, a telegram from Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle arrived enquiring about the explosion and loss of life. The disaster attracted massive publicity. Last survivor, day three Between four and five o'clock in the morning on Friday 14 December, No. 1 pit signal bell rang. The mining engineers were sent for and a bottle of brandy was lowered and the bottle was removed. As the cage was not usable a makeshift pulley was set up and a small kibble (bucket) was attached. John Mammatt, the engineer in charge volunteered to descend the shaft. Another volunteer was sought and Thomas Embleton, with the permission of his father also went down. The shaft was wet, they were soaked and it probably took 15 minutes to descend. They found Samuel Brown, one of the recovery party from the previous morning who had been in the pit for nearly 24 hours. They ventured a little distance into the workings but found no other living person and saw the workings were on fire. The three men, balanced precariously in the kibble were raised to the surface. Brown explained he was in the lamp room when the pit fired and was unconscious for some time. He made his way to the shaft bottom where he rang the bell. Aftermath On Saturday 15 December three or four more explosions occurred. A meeting between the colliery viewers and the government inspector concluded that nothing more could be done for those below, and with the mine alight the only option was to seal it to extinguish the fire. On the following Monday 17 December work started to seal the three shafts. From 30 January until 5 November 1867, hourly checks were made at the shafts until it was deemed safe to reopen them. Tomlinson describes a visit he made to the pithead during this time: Once the shafts were reopened and ventilation established the task of recovering the bodies began. Jeffcock's body was discovered on Saturday 2 October 1869 and buried the following Monday.Clipping from \\"The Standard\\" of 9 October 1869 pasted onto the last page of The colliery reopened in December 1870. The 150 bodies still underground were recovered. It was noted in contemporary reports that some of the bodies were sufficiently preserved to permit identification. =Sightseers and funerals= On Sunday 16 December, special trains filled with sightseers ran to Barnsley from Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield and Manchester. Roads to the colliery were filled with sightseers and vehicles. Special services were held in Barnsley's churches where the Bishop of Ripon was the preacher. The bodies that had been recovered were interred in Ardsley churchyard, where 35 were buried in a mass grave, at Monk Bretton and in the new municipal cemetery. =Families= Major disasters had a devastating impact on local communities and Hoyle Mill and nearby settlements lost most of their young and adult males leaving scores of widows and even more dependant children. The Oaks disaster happened at a time of multiple catastrophes in coal mines. Around Barnsley there had been several major disasters including 73 deaths at Oaks in 1847, 75 at Darley Main in Worsborough in 1849 and 198 at Lundhill in 1857. In 1866 nearly all the males in Hoyle Mill perished, some families lost not only the breadwinner but three or four sons. The disaster left 167 widows and 366 children under twelve. It was a national disaster and funds were raised immediately to support the families. Queen Victoria subscribed ¬£200 and the Lord Mayor of London opened a fund. Money was raised in many parts of the country and small sums were donated by individuals. The Oaks Colliery Relief Fund was established in Barnsley and in total ¬£48,747 was raised of which ¬£11,695 came from the Lord Mayor's Mansion House fund. Altogether 690 individuals were eligible for relief, but although ¬£27,000 remained in the fund in 1908, families were inadequately supported. Some miners subscribed to accident insurance clubs which could not cope with the cost of such sudden high demands. Some local friendly societies paid their members grants towards funeral costs and colliery owners provided a small amount of temporary aid and allowed the families to stay rent free in the pit houses. The union, still in its infancy, paid ¬£8 in funeral costs, 5 shillings per week to widows and a shilling for children under twelve. Five shillings is . and two shillings and sixpence for each child under the age of thirteen was paid from the public relief fund. Should a widow remarry she received a bonus of ¬£20 (), but all further benefit ceased. Inquest The inquest opened on 14 December at the Old White Bear public house in Hoyle Mill. The Coroner was Major Thomas Taylor (1823-1900) 15 jurors were sworn in and 16 bodies were identified. The proceedings moved to Barnsley Court House on 20 December. The inquest lasted for 13 days, but despite the evidence given by several miners and the evidence from the deputation who had complained about the presence of gas to the management two weeks before the explosions, no definite conclusion could be reached. The district mines' inspector, Charles Morton, resigned during the inquest with ill health and his place was taken by Joseph Dickinson from Lancashire. William Gibson gave evidence that the night before the meeting of the men and the management, gas had fired at his master, Andrew Barker's lamp and he was \\"knocked up\\" after three and a half hours work. Gibson left his job at the colliery the Sunday before the explosion after four or five years employment. Matthew Hague, a night deputy, told the inquest of finding 16 bodies between and : \\"They were not burnt or scorched in the least, but appeared as if asleep.\\" James Marsh, a miner from Worsbro'dale tried to push on past Hague, but had to turn back \\"as the air was so bad\\" The inquest could not conclusively ascertain what had caused the explosion or what was the source of the first ignition. Some survivors mentioned an exceptionally violent blast just before the main explosion. This may have been caused by blasting the drift near the Barnsley seam which ignited pockets of firedamp. The initial blast may have caused a chain reaction triggering a firedamp and coal dust explosion that devastated the rest of the pit. Although the cause was never properly discovered, 17 explosions were recorded at the Oaks Colliery. After the inconclusive verdict was delivered the reactions in the press included a barrage of condemnation and criticism. On behalf of the Mines Inspectorate, Joseph Dickinson submitted his report to parliament at the end of April 1867. Petitions were sent to the Home Office asking for an official inquiry into the disaster and the unsafe state of coal mines generally. Dickinson and a representative of the colliery owners were interviewed by a select committee of the House of Commons but the government responded with no urgency and twelve more explosions had occurred before the 1872 Coal Mines Act was operational. Legacy Monument at Ardsley A monument to those killed in the disaster was erected at Christ Church, Ardsley in Barnsley in 1879. A second monument was erected in 1913 to Parkin Jeffcock and the volunteer rescuers who were killed. Parliament considered the subject of colliery accidents in 1868. During 1865‚Äì6 the deaths of 2,468 workers led to calls for more to be done to prevent such accidents. Inspectors visited after the accidents had taken place and nothing was done to prevent them. Complaints made by workmen to the mines inspectors usually had substance. An increase in the number of inspectors was considered but conditions could only improve when the collieries were better managed. Unskilled managers and their subordinates, underground viewers needed educating. Disasters caused the colliery owners to become more receptive to inspections as accidents and losses would be lessened if sub-inspectors could make suggestions as to the better management of the collieries making them safer for the workforce. The great loss of life in the pits led to the announcement of a Royal Commission. Death toll It was stated under oath and in two Command Reports to Parliament that the explosions killed 361 men and boys, based on 340 working below ground in the first explosion (with six survivors) and 27 rescuers killed on 13 December. The accident was the worst in British mining history until the Senghenydd Colliery Disaster which claimed 439 lives in the South Wales coalfield in 1913. The Oaks disaster remains the worst in an English coalfield. A volunteer research project by the Dearne Valley Landscape Partnership in 2016 produced a list of 383 names although not all were verified as died in the disaster. The ages of those killed ranges from 10 to 67.

A right- handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler, he plays first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Patel made his One Day International debut for England in August 2008, however was later dropped from the side after failing to meet fitness levels. After an absence of 2 and a half years, he returned to the ODI side in 2011 and made his Twenty20 International debut, before becoming the 651st player to represent England at Test cricket by winning his first cap on the tour of Sri Lanka in 2012. Early and personal life Samit Patel was born in Leicester on 30 November 1984, to Rohit and Sejal. His parents originated from Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India, where he has relatives. Patel's brother Akhil (b. 1990) has also played for Nottinghamshire, making his debut in 2009. Patel was educated at Eastwood Comprehensive School but later studied at Worksop College in north Nottinghamshire where he was a member of the 1st XI cricket team for five seasons. Whilst at the College, Patel represented England at under 15, under-17 and under-19 levels. He helped them record wins over such schools as Repton, Manchester Grammar School and Shrewsbury School and such clubs as the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). =Fitness issues= Having been previously included in England's ODI and T20 squads for the tour of the West Indies in March and April 2009, Patel was dropped over fitness concerns. Hugh Morris, the director of English cricket, stated that \\"Samit Patel is a talented cricketer but he, like every other player who joins the senior England team, must be aware of the strict fitness criteria that will be set. It is extremely frustrating that Samit has not heeded the warnings of his county, Nottinghamshire, and Geoff Miller [national selector] as well as the England management and strength and conditioning team. In the circumstances we had no option but to de select him from the tour ... his fitness levels have regressed between his first assessment during the build up to the England Lions tour and the second Test during the first week in New Zealand.\\" Despite the setback, in April 2009 Patel was selected for England's 25-man performance squad. Having worked to improve his fitness, Patel said \\"I have had to accept some difficult truths ... I don't want to be in a position again where I miss out on selection because of a lack of fitness\\". Initially included in the 30-man preliminary squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, Patel failed to make the final 15-man squad because of ongoing fitness problems. Geoff Miller commented \\"I'm disappointed for us and for him, but we've laid down the rules and players have to abide by them. He feels he's been putting the work and time in, but he cannot explain it ‚Äì the figures are there\\". In September 2009, a year after he was granted an incremental contract with the ECB, Patel's England contract was not renewed for 2009‚Äì2010. He remained on the fringes of selection, however his level of fitness prevented his selection. In January 2010, Miller stated that \\"He knows what is required ... the ball is in his court now and he has to go away and understand what is necessary\\". When England's provisional 30-man squad for the 2011 World Cup was announced in December that year, Patel was included. England coach Andy Flower had commented that Patel's style of play would be well suited to the pitches in the Indian subcontinent, which was hosting the tournament, however persistent fitness problems meant he was not selected in the final squad of 15 and not called up when the squad sustained injuries. Domestic and T20 career Since making his d√©but for Nottinghamshire at the age of 16, Patel has featured consistently in the team, in both first-class and List A matches. He became the only man in the history of the English Twenty20 competition to claim a double-wicket-maiden, when Nottinghamshire played Derbyshire at New Road, Worcester in 2006. He scored 887 runs in the County Championship in 2007 including four centuries ‚Äì he also took 10 wickets and topped the county's bowling averages. In the 2008 season, Patel made a steady start to Nottinghamshire's first-class campaign, scoring a century against Durham and three half-centuries. Nottinghamshire were runners-up to Durham in the 2009 County Championship; from 15 matches Patel scored 712 runs (the 4th most for the club that year) at an average of 30.95, with a highest score of 95. He also took 32 wickets at an average of 47.84, with two five wicket hauls. In January 2010, Patel signed a three-year deal with Nottinghamshire. He part funded a journey to the Darren Lehmann Cricket Academy in Australia where he spent February and March, part of which was aimed at improving his fitness. When Nottinghamshire won the County Championship in 2010, Patel contributed fewer runs: 641 from 16 matches at an average of 26.70, making him the club's 6th highest run-scorer in the year's competition. His solitary century in the competition, an innings of 104 from 185 balls, came in a defeat to Somerset in July. In July 2019, he was selected to play for the Rotterdam Rhinos in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. On 17 September 2020, in the 2020 t20 Blast, Patel played in his 100th consecutive T20 match for the Notts Outlaws.

Patel remained part of England's ODI team for the series against South Africa later that summer, taking the notable wicket of Herschelle Gibbs in the first ODI of the series at Headingley. He recorded figures of 5/41 and scored 31 runs off 49 balls in the third ODI to win the man of the match award as England claimed the series.

Patel had been in the preliminary list for the player auction ahead of the 2012 Indian Premier League but opted to withdraw to concentrate on English domestic cricket as participating would have meant missing up to seven County Championship matches. =2012 Pakistan and Sri Lanka= The new year began with Patel's inclusion in the England Lions squad to tour Sri Lanka in late January and early February 2012 for a one-day series. Patel played in all five matches and scored 128 runs with a highest score of 50, and was the leading wicket-taker on either side in the series with 12 wickets.

He is a right- handed batsman and right-arm medium-fast bowler.  Early life  Hoffmann was born on 14 January 1970 in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia. Career As a youngster, Hoffmann competed as a woodchopper, following in his father's footsteps. However at the age of 12, while chopping barefoot, he slipped and removed the tip of his left big toe. Following this horrific event Paul never regained his technique and turned to cricket to fill the void. After playing for the Australian Country team against the West Indies in 1993 and for Manly in Sydney, he emigrated to Scotland in 1997, first playing for the Uddingston club as an overseas professional. He liked it so much that he stayed on and played as an amateur. As of the end of the 2007 season, he was the leading wicket taker in the history of the Scottish National League with 282 wickets. He qualified by residence to play for Scotland in 2001, making his d√©but in a match against an England Amateur team on 14 August 2001 taking five wickets.

Several variations of the lyrics are available online, but do not include the final line from Dennis Day's RCA recording: \\"Sure, 'twas the most beautiful fight y' ever did see when Clancy lower'd the boom!\\" The song was also recorded by Dan Dailey and The Andrews Sisters on March 11, 1949 for Decca Records (catalog No. 24610) and additionally by the Ames Brothers who recorded it for Coral Records (catalog No. 60154) on January 21, 1949. It was Petula Clark's second single in 1949. Alice Faye sang the song at least four times on The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show. On his VH1 Storytellers record with Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash mentions that the melody for his well-known Columbia Records hit \\"Don't Take Your Guns to Town\\" was taken from \\"Clancy Lowered the Boom\\".

It is the sequel to Odell Lake. Gameplay The player takes on the role of a fish who in turn must eat, stay clean and avoid being eaten by predators to survive. There are several modes of gameplay. In Tournament mode, the player plays every fish in the game, starting as the tiny silver sprat and eventually reaching the great white shark. A shorter Challenge mode picks four random fish (from smallest to largest) instead. The player can choose to play any fish in Practice Mode. Finally, in Create-A-Fish the player creates their own species based on various parameters such as size and agility, which also affect the appearance of the fish. The color, special ability, and nocturnal or diurnal habits are also selected. Special moves, also present for some 'real' fish, include the stingray's sting and the cuttlefish's ink squirt. Each fish has different preferences for food, as described in the educational summary before the game starts. The game consists of nine screens, arranged in three levels from the sandy bottom to the reef's top, that various fish, including the player, move through looking for food. To survive, or to gain enough points to reach the next fish, the player's fish has to find enough food (which can include plants, crustaceans or coral as well as fish) to prevent its constantly decreasing energy bar from reaching 0 and death. The other main concern, besides avoiding predators, is health, which can only be repaired by finding a bluestreak cleaner wrasse while playing as a diurnal fish, or a banded coral shrimp while playing as a nocturnal fish, and moving next to it. Health takes a serious drop if the fish eats something poisonous to it, often a sea slug or sponge.

Warriparinga (meaning Windy Place in the local Kaurna language) is a nature reserve comprising in the metropolitan suburb of Bedford Park, in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. It has historical, cultural and environmental significance as a traditional Kaurna ceremonial meeting place and as a site of early European settlement. Also known as Fairford, Laffer's Triangle and the Sturt Triangle, Warriparinga is bordered by Marion Road, Sturt Road and South Road, and is traversed by the Sturt River as it exists from Sturt Gorge to travel west across the Adelaide Plains. Culturally, Warriparinga has particular significance to the Kaurna people through its association with the Tjilbruke Dreaming story and as the beginning of the Tjilbruke Trail. An interpretive museum, the Living Kaurna Cultural Centre is located on the site and recognises this tradition. The area also has historical significance as an early European settlement site, as it was settled in the 1840s soon after the establishment of South Australia. A heritage listed farmhouse remains on the site, having remained essentially unchanged after modifications were made in the 1920s, and the land contains grape vines and fruit trees planted by the early settlers. In 1998 the site was redeveloped as a native wetland. Stocked with native vegetation and fish, the wetland was designed to filter water from the Sturt River before it reached the Patawalonga. Geography and location Bounded by Sturt Road to the north, Marion Road to the west, and South Road to the south east, Warriparinga is part of a triangular section of land located in the southern Adelaide suburb of Bedford Park in the City of Marion. The site is traversed by the Sturt River which emerges from Sturt Gorge to enter Warriparinga as it starts to make its way along the Adelaide Plains, eventually joining the Patawalonga River. A portion of the Sturt River's flow is diverted on the site to form the Warriparinga Wetlands, while the river runs along a concrete drain once it leaves Warriparinga and continues in this vein until it joins the Patawalonga in Glenelg North. Pre-European settlement A scarred tree at Warriparinga. Bark was removed to produce a shield or tray. Prior to European settlement, Warriparinga played a significant role in the traditions of the local Kaurna people ‚Äì Warriparinga is the gateway to the Tjilbruke Dreaming, which relates the story of how many of the springs south of Adelaide were formed. Warriparinga was also a camping ground for the indigenous population, with kangaroos, emus and wallabies in the area, along with supplies of native food. Evidence of the traditional uses of the land includes a scarred tree, possibly used to make a shield or dish, and a number of scatter sites in the area where archaeologists have found aboriginal implements. =Tjilbruke Dreaming= In the Dreaming, Tjilbruke's nephew, Kulultuwi, joined Tjilbruke and his half brothers, Jurawi and Tetjawi, on a hunt. Tjilbruke became separated from his nephews as he followed the tracks of an emu, returning to discover that Kulultuwi had killed the emu that Tjilbruke had been hunting. This was against local law, as the emu now belonged to Tjilbruke. Kulultuwi apologised, and, accepting his apology, Tjilbruke continued on his journey. With Tjilbruke gone, Kulultuwi was slain by his half brothers, on the grounds that Kulultuwi had broken the law by killing Tjilbruke's emu. They then bore his body to Warriparinga, where they intended to prepare it for burial. Tjilbruke came looking for Kulultuwi, and, determining that Kulultuwi had been murdered by his half brothers, killed Jurawi and Tetjawi at the site. Picking up his nephew's body, Tjilbruke carried him south to Patparno (Rapid Bay) for burial, resting at various locations along the path. Where he rested his tears created freshwater springs, and, after Kulultuwi was buried, Tjilbruke's body turned to iron pyrite as his grief led him to choose to give up life as a man. With the death of his body, his spirit transformed into a glossy ibis ‚Äì a motif that is featured in many aspects of Warriparinga today. Post-European settlement Fairford House at Warriparinga. After the establishment of the City of Adelaide, the land was granted to George Fife Angas in 1839. Named after a local ford, \\"Fairford\\" consisted of land and a single-roomed cottage. In 1843 George Angas leased the site to Henry William Trimmer. Trimmer worked the land for many years, eventually purchasing the site from the South Australian Company in 1862 for the sum of ¬£1,118. Under Trimmer's custodianship, Fairford was developed to include over of vineyards ‚Äì incorporating Gouais, Verdelho, Black Portugal and Grenache varieties ‚Äì and various fruit trees. Henry Trimmer became a respected viticulturist, eventually taking on the role of Treasurer for the South Australian Vinegrowers' Association, although his \\"addiction to his own vintage\\" was to result in health problems later in life. During this time the house was extended and a coach house was added to the property in the 1860s ‚Äì it is suggested by Dolling that these improvements may have been designed by colonial architect, (and Lord Mayor), Edmund Wright. Upon Trimmer's death in 1867, the property was passed to Trimmer's wife, Eliza Catherine Trimmer, and Edward Amand Wright, before being sold to Henry Laffer in 1876. Henry Laffer continued farming the land, although his son, Albert, chose to focus more on fruit trees than vineyards and grazing. The house was also modified during this period, with significant alterations occurring in the 1890s and again in 1923, at which point it took the form that it retains today ‚Äì that of a 1920s bungalow.\\"A step back in time at Warriparinga\\" 2001, p. 3 The Laffer family remained on the property for 112 years, earning it the new name of \\"Laffer's Triangle\\". =Development= Over the years the property was considered for a number of projects, and parts of the land have been sold to various commercial and government interests. Warriparinga has been considered as the site for a number of major developments, such as the Marion Shopping Centre and Flinders Medical Centre ‚Äì the latter moved because of concerns regarding a fault line that passes through the property, while the former was repositioned further west at the urging of both the investors and the Highways Department. Projects that did go ahead included a holiday park, a (now defunct) restaurant, call centres, a science park as part of the failed Multifunction Polis project, and the Sturt police station. Three of the recent developments resulted in controversy. The first of these, the 1991 rebuilding of the South Road bridge over the Sturt River, led to the formation of the Friends of Laffer's Triangle when a local resident noticed the damage that the construction had caused to the local environment. Environmental issues came to the fore during the planning of the Southern Expressway, along with concerns that the work would destroy a significant archaeological site at Warriparinga. A similar combination of concerns resulted in changes to the Ansett Australia Call Centre after it was proposed in 2000, as both environmental and cultural issues led to a number of protests against its construction, although, like the other two projects, the call centre was eventually completed on the site.\\"Call centre a threat to river: group\\" 2000, p. 9\\"Call Centre Opened\\" 2001, p. 11 =Renaming= Paul and Naomi Dixon started lobbying the Marion Council to protect the site in 1992, calling for the development of a \\"Warriparinga Interpretive Centre\\". Warriparinga, meaning \\"windy river place\\", was derived from a number of Kaurna names and variant spellings that have been recorded for the site, including Warri Parri, Warriparri, Warreparinga and Walpari. As a result, in the early 1990s, the Friends of Laffer's Triangle changed their name to Friends of Warriparinga. As the plans developed the name started to be applied to the entire project and, over time, the site as a whole. Eventually the name was formally accepted for the Warriparinga Reserve and the Warriparinga Wetlands, and today the name has almost entirely replaced the earlier terms. Warriparinga Wetlands One of the small ponds that make up part of the wetlands. The Warriparinga Wetlands was a combined project by the Marion Council, the Patawalonga Catchment Water Management Board and the Land Management Corporation, who provided the land that was required. Using a $1.7 million grant from the State Government, the wetlands were developed to filter water traveling along the Sturt River before it reached the Patawalonga. While the overall design was conducted by B C Tonkin and Associates, the project involved a number of bodies, and, as no archaeological study had been previously undertaken on the site, one was organised. In addition, given the cultural significance of the site to the Kaurna people, representatives from the Kaurna Aboriginal Community and Heritage Association were included in the reference group. The final design consists of four ponds that are fed by water diverted from the Sturt River using a strategically placed fallen log. Native vegetation has been planted around the area, and incorporates native food sources and plants that were employed by the indigenous population for their fiber. The ponds were stocked with a number of fish that were native to the area, including southern black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri), bigheaded gudgeon (Philypnodon grandiceps), bridled goby (Arenigobius bifrenatus) and common galaxias (Galaxias maculatus). Work started on the new wetlands in June, 1998, and was completed by December of that year. The wetlands were officially opened by John Olsen, the then Premier of South Australia, on 16 December 1998. =Awards= In 1999, a year after the wetlands were developed, the project was awarded a State CASE Earth Award. Created by the Civil Contractors Federation and Case Construction Equipment, the awards are intended to acknowledge environmental engineering within the civil engineering field.\\"Environment award for wetland project\\" (1999) p. 23 A second award came in 2000 when the wetlands were granted a commendation in the South Australian Engineering Excellence Awards, at which the judges noted the attention that the developers had paid to the sensitive issues that were involved, given the mix of cultural, residential and business concerns, along with the engineering principles and practices that were employed at the site. Living Kaurna Cultural Centre The entrance to the cultural centre. First proposed in 1992 by Paul and Naomi Dixon, the Living Kaurna Cultural Centre (then known as the Warriparinga Interpretive Centre) was intended to educate visitors about the local Kaurna culture. After several years of discussion, in 1998 the project received funding through a federal grant of $1.45 million via the Federation Cultural and Heritage Program. Even with the funding now available, a number of setbacks occurred during development. Difficulties in finding compromise positions between stakeholders led the council to consider passing up the federal grant, and while that problem was overcome, there were ongoing concerns about where to locate the project. The original intent had been to build the cultural centre on the opposite side of Sturt River to Fairford house, but infrastructure costs and changes to the design of the wetlands prevented this from going ahead. Another site at Warriparinga was considered, but the construction of the Ansett Call Centre took precedence. The final location, next door to Fairford house, raised its own set of concerns, with suggestions that it would generate an architectural and cultural clash. Nevertheless, the plan won the support of the council and Heritage SA, and proceeded accordingly. Work was completed on the Living Kaurna Cultural Centre by early September, 2002, and it was officially opened later that month by representatives of the Kaurna people, the Marion Council Mayor, and local federal parliamentarian, Andrew Southcott. The building was designed by Phillips/Pilkington Architects Pty Ltd and Habitable Places, and features a corrugated iron roof modeled to resemble the sweep of an ibis' wings, drawing a direction connection to the Tjilbruke Dreaming. The building incorporates an art gallery, a caf√©, a retail area and a large stage, and the centre is used for education, cultural events, and retail sales of aboriginal and related produce. Art installations and cultural events Tjilbruke narna arra, Tjilbruke Gateway by Sherry Rankine, Margaret Worth and Gavin Malone. Located on the site is Tjilbruke narna arra, Tjilbruke Gateway, a representation of the Tjilbruke Dreaming by artists Sherry Rankine, Margaret Worth and Gavin Malone. Commissioned by the City of Marion, the work consists of a number of tree trunks clustered together, interwoven with symbolic representations of aspects from the Dreaming. Amongst these symbols are a number of circles around selected trunks, representing the freshwater springs that were created by Tjilbruke's tears; flows of coloured sands running through the work to represent the gully winds and the \\"flow of the river and of life\\"; and a representation of an ibis positioned above iron pyrite, symbolising Tjilbruke's final transformation. The work was intended, amongst other aims, to provide a space in which the Dreaming stories could be related by members of the Kaurna people. Warriparinga has been the site of a number of significant cultural events in recent years. These include the \\"friendship fires\\" initiated in 1999 by Georgina Williams, which were lit at each full moon. The events brought together up to 150 people, and were used by members of the Kaurna people to help maintain a connection to the land. A similar fire was lit in May, 2004, and allowed to burn for several days as part of the National Reconciliation Week. The 2004 fire served as the centerpiece of a number of local celebrations and events during that period ‚Äì including a farewell ceremony for outgoing Mayor, Colin Haines, and a protest against the building of the Ansett Call Centre close to the site.\\"Reconciliation Burns Bright in Warriparinga\\" 2000, p. 3 Other Reconciliation Week events held at Warriparinga include the 2009 launch of the first new bark canoe since European settlement. Built by Paul Dixon, the canoe was carved using traditional techniques from a tree found in nearby Mitchell Park.
